I'm also on a cellphone, so please excuse any formatting issues. FTP, LTL 

I normally take 120 mg OxyContin once a day and they usually last anywhere between 20-24 hours before I start to feel any of the withdrawal symptoms. On Monday morning at 8am, I took my usual 120 mgs (three 40 mg ER pills cut in half) and later on in the evening I started to feel a sinus headache coming on so I took 50 mg of Benadryl and fell asleep. I woke up at 9:30 and felt fine, which took me by surprise. I was able to make it until 1pm before the whole runny nose, yawning and cold chills started. My question is, has anyone else experienced anything like this and can I start taking Benadryl on days where I know that I won't be able to score on time? Or was this just a one time thing? 
Thanks for reading! Have a great day!

TL:DR- when I took some Benadryl, I noticed that I went longer without feeling any withdrawal symptoms. Anyone else experience this too?",1515586391.0

But, I think it's good to acknowledge the silver linings in life, even for the ugliest things... so, please share one good thing that has come from your opiate addiction. (Or just your opiate use, if you think you're not to that point yet)

For me, it's made me a more compassionate person, simply because I realize now that it's easy to be strong and friendly when you feel well, and hard when you don't. I mean, I knew that before, but going through that cycle over and over has really hammered it home to where I really *feel* it now. Now when I encounter someone who is acting weak or mean, my first impulse is to wonder if they are not feeling well... and I also refrain from judging them. How *can* I judge? When I have no idea what burden they carry inside?

Another good thing is that I'm pretty sure it has permanently improved my social anxiety. It's something I would notice when I was high, but the benefits have stuck around even after weeks or months of abstaining. I think it has a therapeutic effect that gave me the space to change the negative thinking that was causing my social anxiety.",1515583557.0

Can you shorten the withdrawal and if so how long should I use the short acting opiates before I go cold turkey?","TLDR: If you become dependent on long acting opiates (methadone/suboxone) is it possible to switch and become dependent on short acting opiates so that the withdrawal is shorter when you go cold turkey or just to kratom?

I have always noticed that an opiate/oid with a long half life has comparatively longer withdrawals when you you stop taking them.

I been taking unprescribed black market methadone at about the same dose abour ~95% of the days since october 1st 2017. The other 5% I was using ecp heroin.

Before October I was using a combination of raw opium that I used oral and heroin every day since around the beginning of June. Prior to that I had been clean for several months. Obviously because I have as much methadone as I want and the only limiting factor is money I have cheat days but I generally stick to a fairly rigid routine because in order to feel any kind of high from methadone I have to use absurd amounts and the high is also not as quality as some other types of drugs.

I have heard withdrawal from methadone and suboxone can last months and is generally horrific and should be avoided at all costs unless you do a long long taper.

My question is if switch to back to a short acting opiate/oid such as oxycodone or morphine or even heroin for long enough, could I shorten the length of the withdrawal? How long do you think I would have to be on the short acting opiate to make a difference.

Ok so long story short I’ve been taking oxycodone / hydrocodone pretty much every day for the past month. Before that it was just occasionally, got a wisdom tooth pulled + a prescription... and that was that. 

Anyways here I am. I need about 20-25mg of oxycodone or 30ish of hydro to feel anything. I never dose more than 2 times a day, sometimes only at night. 

I can definitely go 24 hours without experiencing any withdrawals, but then I always take a dose so I really haven’t gone long enough to truly know. 

I feel like I’m doing a pretty small amount... I had a heroin problem 6 years ago and this just seems like a totally different (and way less dangerous / addicting) problem. 

I get another wisdom tooth out Thursday, so I’ll get a script. Planning on taking those and then quitting when they’re gone. Last tooth they gave me 20 5mg Perc and 20 Vic

Idk. Any opinions on if I’m just overthinking it? Will I even go through real withdrawals? Thanks guys. ",1515544506.0

Help,"Hey Fam❤Not sure if I would be better off posting this in r/kratom.. But I don't know those people in there lol And I love you guys and trust your judgement. So here's my question..

I've been an opiate addict for 10 years now. And doing fent for most of this past year. Between a G and a G and a half a day. Well, the time has come to kick. I've gotten mixed answers regarding using kratom to come off of fent. Some have said, it won't touch me because it's not dope. Others have said the opposite. Let me specify, I'm not sure if what I've been using is actually fent or an analog. My guess would be an analog because it lasts a long time, and has legs for days. 

I know I'm going to taper down as low as possible before kicking. But would Kratom help with fent wds? Or is fent too strong. And if it will help, which strain do I go with? I've heard Red Bali. But I'm open to other suggestions. Need to figure this out and soon! Thank you for reading this and trying to help me😀😊

Edit- Forgot to mention, I've kicked before using suboxone. Subutex, and methadone. I've only taken kratom in wds a couple times but it was only for 1 day at a time. And I was using dope at the time. So thats why I wanted to try Kratom to detox this time, if it will actually help. I fucking hope so!",1515535060.0

However, I am desperately searching for something that offers some glimpse of a more ""progressive,"" approach. Anyone have a suggestion that I should check out?","I have gotten to the point where I am beaten down and ready to commit. I have finally gotten to a point in my addiction where the idea that this disease will kill me has become very real. Before it was just a concept. It didn't feel as if the way I used, or what I was doing could ever end up with me accidentally killing myself. However, this run that I am currently on has just been unbelievably desperate and straight up reckless. I remember having to buy some new stuff from a guy I had never bought from before. I had never tried anything he was selling, and normally I would take the necessary precautions to make sure I wasn't loading up an insanely powerful shot. For some reason I just went ahead and loaded up a full shot, and when I was about to be done injecting it I remember saying to myself ""well there's no going back now. Let's hope for the best here."" Next thing I know I am waking up two hours later extremely disoriented, and not knowing what had happened. As soon as I had figured out what had just happened I just got on my knees and began thanking some God I don't even believe in really. Since then it has just become very real that it is only a matter of time before I end up kill myself. Given all that I am ready to go to treatment for what will be like the 13,14,or 15th time. I have no idea at this point. I am also someone that just doesn't believe in the way a traditional rehab is set up and run. I don't think that telling everyone there is only a single way that this thing can be achieved is healthy, or even true. So when I get to these places I just keep to myself. I don't talk. I don't voice those opinions. I just stay quiet, and develop my own routine that I believe is beneficial to me, and I don't tell anyone else how they should be spending their time there. I am specifically talking about developing a regular routine that involves, meditation, yoga, reading, some form of creativity, and a healthy diet. None of this is very ""out there."" It is just stuff that isn't necessarily taught at your traditional rehab, and I am just so tired of going to these same places, reading the same info packets, watching the same movies, listening to the same speakers. It just doesn't fucking work for me, and if you want to tell me I am arrogant, and self centered, and not as unique as I think I am go right ahead. I don't see it that way. I see the way this epidemic has spread, and the way these treatment centers pack them in, and spit them out, and I don't think it is that far fetched to say something is wrong. Anyways I am beginning to rant now, and I was only coming here to ask if someone has gone anywhere on the east coast and would recommend it to me based on everything I have said here. I have very good insurance until that ends at the end of Feb. so it is time for me to capitalize on that privilege for the last bit of time that is available to me. Also please do not assume that I am asking for the nicest facilities that offer a hot tub, a sauna, massages every morning, a personal trainer every afternoon... etc.. I am just looking for a place that wont immediately tell me that I am essentially dumb for thinking that MAYBE, JUST MAYBE smoking weed every once in awhile isn't going to immediately bring the house down and kill everything I hold dear.

So I slammed the 100mg, gave it 10 minutes (Just to be sure) and, while I did feel alright, I could've felt a lot better, so I slammed the 50mg as well.

I don't remember much after that, but I awoke with my head resting on the closed toilet seat, I had the worlds most excruciating headache, felt deathly sick and was spewing up for a good couple of hours, my body was covered in cold sweat, and movement was laboured.

7pmifx,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7pmifx/the_relapse_carousel/,9,https://redd.it/7pmifx,JrSmith82,The Relapse Carousel,"8 months ago, with my life going nowhere (slamming goof/speedballs for 3 years) and an inability to find veins without a mighty struggle, I thought I’d give rehab a shot, at least long enough for my veins to heal up and resurface. So I’m doing some 90 day program in a county facility but clashing heads with counselors and staff members over misinformation regarding addiction, & AA.NA fellowship book thumpers who, quite frankly, don’t know a goddamn thing about the most effective approach to helping addict populations at large & seem to think that the anecdotal evidence they use to validate their approaches to “recovery” carry the weight of some statistically significant findings published in a peer-reviewed medical journal. 

None of these people actually bothered me though, and in fact, I stuck around long enough to realize that 1)I’d completely forgotten what it was like to be sober & 2)I think I may prefer this sobriety thing to withdrawing my balls off each morning before hustling up a shot. Unfortunately, I was one of the younger 20-somethings in this facility, and the younger dudes tend to stick together, so when heroin and rigs both found their way into the facility, I VERY reluctantly shot up for a couple of days & got kicked out. 
To sum up the last five months, I was homeless for about a week, during which I managed to OD on a glorious speedball before quickly checking into another program, with much more motivation than simply “making shooting up easier.” I still relapsed inside this place—again with considerable reluctance, indicating to me that I’m much closer to sobriety than I’ve ever been—but the difference this time being that I was allowed to finish the program & hooked up with 3 months of sober living.
 
I was fucking determined to slam the door shut this time around so I took the Vivitrol route and things were splendid for months, right up until they weren’t. This has been my first week under a reduced level of care(weekly outpatient) and while making a pit stop at 7/11 before seeing my Vivitrol doc last Friday(30+ days since last shot, tolerance low), I run into an old rehab friend who tells me he has some china in his pocket. Now, china on the west coast is like spotting a Yeti riding a fucking unicorn, so china usually signals “fent” for me, but instead of having a healthy fear and respect for fucking dying, I couldn’t bring myself to turn it down. 

So 120+ days of sobriety and cool new job be damned, I did a “baby” shot that knocked me on my ass hard enough to nod out on the 7/11 counter trying to pick out a pack of cigarettes. 

Of all the relapses, this last one hurt the most. I’d like to make this abundantly clear—I REALLY want to stop, but thus far that shot has not taken anything away from me except a clean date. I always told myself, “if circumstances XYZ hold in my life, I won’t feel like shooting dope.” Now, all the shit leading up to this relapse felt like a perfect storm of terrible luck and timing, but I can’t stop telling myself “hey, you didn’t die, maybe you can chip a couple times a month and just stop obsessing over it between uses,” but I know exactly where that will lead, so I just wanna know 

**TL;DR Does the relapse carousel ever fucking stop??**

Specifically, I take 500/50mg of caffeine/ephedrine 3x daily for weight loss/control and for energy. Would the increased norepinephrine from this stack be inhibited in its re uptake because of the tramadol and result in far to much norepinephrine in the cns? Or is norepinephrine not really affected by this stack? Or, since I know caffeine acts on the adrenal glands, is there a difference in norepinephrine as a systemic adrenal hormone versus as a CNS neurotransmitter? I’m also admittedly not sure how the ephedrine works in this stack; I used to know but it’s been so long and the stack was successful so guess I just let myself forget and just went with what worked lol. Does the ephedrine work in the CNS? Or can it not cross over into it and that’s why people monkey with and create meth? 

Anyways, I already take an SSRI for depression so any venture into tramadol will be very slow and measured as is, I just wanted to know if any of y’all knew how it would interact with this stimulant stack I take. I appreciate the input,

I have been reading and posting in r/opiates for a long time (this is a different account than my normal). As we all know fentanyl has been showing up in a TON of heroin lately on the streets, really it seems like a majority of it (depending on where you are) has at least some fent in it. It's also been showing up elsewhere too, in counterfit oxies and other opiate/opioid pills, and even xanax or other things. 


I think we can agree this is all disgusting and the dealers who do this are scumbags. Most of them are idiots and hand mix it too, resulting in hotspots, and that kills many people. Also the counterfit pills are even more awful since people doing oxy or vicodin have much lower tolerances than people using heroin. It's terrible either way to sell fentanyl as anything else than fentanyl.


With all of that being said, if you have any questions about fentanyl or any of its analogues, feel free to come over to r/fentanyl or r/carfentanil. We are trying to do good work there with harm reduction and trying to inform people about the dangers of fentanyl without demonizing it like the media has. When it is used correctly, fentanyl and its analogues can be very useful medicine. When used incorrectly, it can used to murder (and I use that word on purpose) many. 


I hope this is okay to post about another subreddit here. I don't want to take traffic away from r/opiates, but rather allow people to use both subs appropriately and inform people that there is a place to discuss fentanyl and its analogues specifically.

Yeah there is somekind of warm but that doesn't feel like everyone describes it, it just feels like your body temperature went up, like walking into more heated room, or going outside in the winter and then you feel less cold than you would doing this sober. Other than that, it increases social skills and make you want to talk, in bigger doses you just talk stupid things and may do some stupid things + forget things.

Besides that I can't see any other profits of taking morphine, you just fell like your legs get weak/soft, slight euphoria-rush (but it's nothing compare to pure MDMA) in your body and head. It last only 1-2 minutes and then slowly coming down to what I wrote above. Is this everything, whole peak? nothing more? [I knew that opioids always worked differently for me](https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7ktqhi/opioids_doesnt_give_me_any_euphoria/), but really? 

It doesn't even make eating more pleasurable, oxycodone did.

And it's very addicting, very fucking addicting 5 minutes. I just went clean from oxycodone binge (- my first one ever to be accurate), (like 80-100mg at the worst daily, 15-20 on the first days and this took 3 maybe 4 mouths - fuck and costed me shit load of money) this 60-some days (or even less) clean were so miserable, even on benzos, even with friend (singular intentionally, have no more friends beside a few in the internet), complete apathy, I didn't wanted to do anything, play games, go out with my friend, go anywhere. Tramadol (that slow release thing 100mg) that helped me to feel a bit normal lately, like before I started my first binge, but still miserable.

**TLDR;** - Does morphine peak + euphoria last only 5 first minutes and then only leave you with increased social skill + feeling of warm (but kinda like you when you wear more clothes or go to more heated room)? Why? What do? I just went clean and starting to use again. What do, my life is miserable.

So needless to say I'm mutilating myself with the last two i have. It's honestly terrible. Has anyone ever overcame this situation? Do you have any tips on how i can get a fresh pack? This is the shittiest set of laws in this county and it can't be good for me and the thousands of other addicts here. Is there a trick to getting them from a pharmacy or somegthing!  Thanks for hearing me out! Any advice is greatly appreciated :\,1515638003.0

edit: almost forgot: this room and its moderators are not affiliated with the subreddit and it has its own rules, regulations, and etiquette. should an issue arise do not take it up with the moderators of r/opiates as they have no say and nothing to do with the operation thereof.

so basically i've figured out what went wrong with tinychat. now, only the creators of the original room can have full moderator powers. i'm considering moving things back there because it supports connecting with phones (albeit crappy) and suchlike. as for tonight, i'll be chilling in both rooms and letting people choose. the tinychat room that i'm temporarily using is https://tinychat.com/room/everythingisstil. I'm not choosing that out of any sort of self-promotional bullshit, it's just that it's the only one that it lets me fully moderate in, which basically means that I can use the youtube player. The other room, located in the sidebar, is at https://www.ezcapechat.com/rooms/whereisopiatechat, which does not easily work with phones but is more stable and allows anyone to add to the youtube queue. i'd prefer to use the one in the sidebar which is the ezcapechat room but if too many people have to connect with phone apps, i'll talk to the mods about moving things back to tinychat somehow. please come by, however, and gaze upon me as i exhaust my supply of speedball materials in one fell swoop. below are the rules and i hope to see you there. and with that, here's the usual copy and paste job.  

if it appears like there is a moderator in the room but who is not speaking, just type a few sentences to summon them back. if you are on mobile it is not immediately apparent that there is anyone in the room. either click the button shaped like an outline of a person (i think) to see the list, or say hello to see if anyone responds.  


rules:  

1. pick a unique username. this is to protect other users so we know who is who, given the nature of the sort of activities we enjoy. 

2. no lurking. again, to protect the other users. if you come in the room be prepared to introduce yourself and participate for at least a few minutes so we know you're not up to any shenanigans. if you are lurking you will be warned and then given a generous ten minutes to announce yourself. if the time runs out, you will be kicked (not banned) until you are ready to come in and actually participate. if you are a known member whose identity can be confirmed, this rule is not applicable.  

3. no -isms or hate speech, even accidental. one warning will be issued, any continued insistence on such behavior will result in a ban. bans can be contested by pm'ing a moderator (me). this includes but is not limited to racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia. for example, if you are not black, use of the n-word, even with the -a ending, will not be tolerated. i don't care if your friend down the block lets you say it, it's not your lane. 

4. no auditory fuckery. due to peculiarities of the transmission of sound over a chat, certain echos and effects can be amplified to the point of being severely distressing. if it is determined that your end is causing an echo you will be asked to use headphones, or to mute your microphone when not speaking. deliberately making strange or unpleasant noises to annoy other chatters will not be tolerated, and your broadcast will be closed. (this only means that your video/audio feed will be terminated--you will still be allowed to type.)  

i know the rules seem like a lot but there's really only four of them, and only two that pertain to just behaving in a manner that isn't dickish. 
thanks, and hope to see you there! **don't use alone.**",1515637866.0

01/10/18

The lethal, apparently fentanyl-laced contaminated materials are coming from Henderson, NC (a notorious hub for the flow of H into the other major cities of NC) and I have seen them pop up in Raleigh, NC, but I don't know where else they are. As Henderson is the source of so much of the state's narcotics, they could be anywhere from Charlotte and Asheville throughout the Triangle (Raleigh, Durham, Chapel Hill) to the eastern coastal areas (such as Wilmington). But Henderson and Raleigh are 100% verified.

The bags are coming as stamps labeled ""Beat Street"" in blue and the material appears as a slightly fluffy white powder with no rocks in it, which dissolves to a mildly tan solution, much like good ECP should. I do not have access to reagents, but the friend who they came from tested his urine after consuming them numerous times, and every time has consistently come up strongly positive for both fentanyl and heroin. Based on the string of overdoses (and even deaths) associated with them, my friend's drug test results, as well as the extreme potency and powdery white consistency (and tendency to dissolve quickly and transparently), I think it's very definitely fentanyl-laced. On top of being extremely potent, these bags are quite a bit heavier than the average legitimate stamp bag in this area (which tend very often to be only about 25-35mg), which only adds to the danger.",1515637157.0

I couldn’t for the life of me fall asleep, and today all throughout the day I just felt horrible. I have a tendency to become addicted to substances based on past benzo use, and I am not really sure when I should start to be concerned about being a heavy user, like what is that considered?

Found a nice ad for ""party favors"" and messaged with the guy back and forth. I asked if he had ""H"" and he immediately hit me with the ""are you a cop?"". Nope, just a junkie bro. I asked him if he had anything other than what he offered and after a little bit he shot back with roxies. I thought, why the fuck not, right? 

So he says he has 10 on him and then-- wait for it this is the kicker--

he says he wants $170 for them. Of course, I'm thinking this is all wayyy to good to be true right? Of course it is. But I'm dumb. And I'm desperate. 10 roxies are any where from $200 to $300 for me, normally. I'm thinking, Theyre pressed. They're fake.

I show up at the spot we agree on and I see some sketchy young kid in a beanie. I'm immediately like, you gotta be fucking me. I hear sirens and shit and the kid looks like he's packing. I know this is how I'm fucking going down. Over some roxies in WD. Only, he hears the sirens and gets sketched the fuck out and darts into the store we're close to, which isn't weird because it's a liquor store. I'm like, sure, okay. Maybe he's not undercover, then. I light up a cigarette and look like I'm waiting. On the inside, I'm shaking in my fucking boots dudes. I am sweating, my hands are shaking, I think I'm gonna puke. I just want to fucking get high and take the edge off the shitty feeling.

""Yeah, theyre gone.""

I'm being paranoid, but I have this awful feeling that travel card wallet with my train tickets and photo ID may have fallen out of my pocket next to my desk at work. It has a small, burnt, folded up square of foil and foil tube tucked behind the photocard.

I'm 99.9% sure it's actually safely in my work drawer with the lighter I used to have a cigarette at lunchtime - but it got me thinking/worrying anyway. 

Even if found, its likely they'll just put it on my desk. However, if someone pokes through it - even still, most people won't know what the hell it is - **but** just in case! Has anyone ever had to make a decent excuse about paraphernalia that paid off? Any suggestions?

A few years ago I had driven over to a customer for my PC repair job I was working at the time. I'd been there a good few hours and I had *really* begun to sweat. I had dope in my car, but no foil to smoke it. The nearest place to buy any was likely close to an hour away. 

So, I finished the job and I straight up said to the woman I'd been working for;

""Hey, my car is having troubles with its radiator, its not cooling - I don't suppose you have something flexible and waterproof I could wrap round the coolant pipe to keep it from leaking until I get to a garage""

Was wondering if any of my homies out here know of any remedies / OTC stuff that might help—even just a little bit—besides Tums, she can’t do the tums/chalk shit haha.. 

Thanks for any advice!!!

After partaking in many community cleanups to no avail I gave up,  no reason kids should have to play around this shit. I went to this same park to use the bathroom inside the kids play area and opened the stall to someone shooting up with kids playing outside. I blacked out and grabbed him by his collar slammed him on the floor and held his face against the floor we wrestled (no punches were thrown) and I finally tackled him outside and after everyone came running I said he was shooting up and we held him down till cops came and arrested him.

I'm fucking struggling br/opiates...Really struggling and I know only you guys will understand just how bad I feel. 

It's foggy, frozen, and wet where it isn't *ice-y*. And I walked through it to get my fix. Enveloped in the fog I just disappear and it's a comfort knowing I can't be seen. Knowing I'm a few minutes away from disappearing emotionally. But then the thoughts come rushing in like a giant wave. One after another and I realize I'm terrified. Of what? *what happens after today? When they drug test me? All you had to do... Just don't put a fucking needle in your arm Admiral.* But I know I will. I know I just have to turn around and go home and the sickness will come but it will also pass, I just have to be strong for few days..Just a few days.

I can't confront life on life's terms, I'm either too weak or just lack the fiber to stand up to it. 

(*Probation, yadayada, used, yadayada..*)

It's just been a roller-coaster of emotions. I've been dosing myself with kratom all day to get this obsession off my mind, Because it really is that... Obsession. But when I spike up and relief washes over me and the thoughts stop, for a moment then I think to myself *dammit you've done it again, why cant you just fucking stop*. 

That thought is immediately followed by *oh, this feeling is why* 

I hope you all stay safe, and I hope if you want to use, you can score. IF you are clean, I hope you stay clean and live a happy fulfilling life. 

I love you all. I hope you find happiness somewhere else besides the needle. Just because I am weak now, I know I will overcome this...

The British used this on the Turks while they were trying to take Jerusalem in WWI. They dropped a sack with fake plans to attack Gaza so the Turks would move their forces away from the actual attack point of Beersheba. But here's where opiates come into play..

I got shot in the leg Monday night over a couple thousand dollars worth of bud. Illegal state. Fucking ridiculous, I know. It's weed, I mean I knew it happened but like hardly ever right?. Anyways I was fine. Got really fucking lucky where they hit. Lost my phone, $400 taser (not just your gay ass stun gun, it fires electrical hooks into you, not fun) and my 3rd juul (more annoying than valuable). Not gonna go into details but yeah I got shot over weed.

Figured I'd share it with that cancerous board known as r/trees just to remind them that shit happens. 

Within minutes some very serious prick comments that I was reported to law enforcement and that it would be easy to trace my city based on comment history (true) and that I was promoting violence and thug culture with my story. WTF!? 

Nah bro, anything but. You think I thought it was cool to take a shot to the leg so close to my dick that of my dick was swinging the wrong way itd be gone? Not at all. It was a reminder to be careful out there and even with legal weed people will still shoot you over less than a pound. 

We went back and forth, he seemed serious about the snitching, didn't smell trolling so I took no chances and deactivated. Just my line of work and all, not worth the risk to me.

Reason I didn't post my full old username is incase that fuck nut did report me and leo decides to look into it. Far fefched I know but I like to be safe. I did say at the end they will wish they killed me cuz I'll have the last laugh so he thought thatd catch their attention.

Since I have recently found out that we are allowed to link people openly where to buy syringes online (and other harm reduction equipment apparently). Look no further! FREE SHIPPING ON ALL ORDERS! BEST QUALITY!

This is the Easy Touch website where you can buy insulin syringes in all different sizes viable for IV use. Free shipping available on all orders! Says the free shipping option takes 5-6 days, but it took 3 days from shipped to my mail box. Shipped from Texas to east coast US. 

Easy Touch is (IMO) the best syringe brand. Actually, they are tied for #1 with BD, except BD syringes are usually a lot more expensive. These cost the exact same amount as buying in person at a pharmacy (at least a box of 100 is, 10 packs cheaper in stores)

Return address on package does say something about medical (I can look up exact return address name tomorrow if anyone cares to know (I think it is Prime Medical Store)), but does not reference syringes or needles at all. Packaging is discreet except for that one fact.

If you can't order to your home, get a PO Box if you really need to. They aren't that expensive for the smallest box (if your package doesn't fit in the box they either leave a slip to pick it up at the counter or leave a key for a bigger box that your package is in) and you could use it to get other harm reduction items online also (fent test strips, micron filters, bacteriostatic water, micron filters and many more!).

Don't reuse needles just because all the dumb pharmacies around you won't sell them and you have no needle exchanges around you! Practice safe injection techniques always! Clean syringes are so cheap there is no excuse not to always use one!

I hope this helps someone out there. Stay safe my junkie brothers and sisters!",1515732833.0

So I was the cause of my own misery like all of us junkies tend to be; only this time it stemmed from an attempt at kindness. (Aforementioned misery was having to wait until 11am the next day to pick up instead of 8pm the night before as was planned )

My main dude is a massive pot head. Like,  him and I would’ve been mad tight back in the day based on our outrageous tolerances and love for any and all things weed. Now being a junkie I ain’t got time or money for weed anymore but I do happen across some concentrates and edibles occasionally. This time I got my hands in some homemade red velvet weed cupcakes. Tasted like bud more than red velvet. But they knocked you on your ass regardless of tolerance. So when I picked up from him a few days ago I gave him one. 

A couple nights later he decides to eat it and forgot to tell me so I could clock how long until it hit him and how hard. So at 8pm I ask to meet. 8:05 he’s like yeah gimme fifteen minutes. Fifteen minutes go by I text. THen call, no answer. I call and text two more times each and say fuck it and leave him a message saying let’s do this in the AM like we often do. He finally calls me back at 1030 apologizing sounding fucking gobsmacked pleading to meet in the AM instead of now cause he forgot he ate that cupcake and needs to stay laying down. We agree on 6am. 

I call him at 6 and nothing. Crazy call this mofo until seven and then go back to bed. He hits me up at around 9 something, just waking up and frantic cause it was his turn to drive the kids to school. Then from 9-11 we stay in contact while he drops the kids off then doubled back to get my shit to meet me. I’m texting him laughing at him and busting his balls about his pot tolerance until we meet at Arby’s and I finally get my shit. 

But yeah. That’s the last fucking time I ever give him an edible. ",1515727546.0

The ingredients in one tab are: Codeine - 8mg. Paracetamol - 500mg. Caffeine - 30mg. Sodium - 427mg. Sorbitol - ???mg.

I've been pretty pissed off that I couldn't really use them since I was under the impression you couldn't CWE effervescent tabs and it's not like I could use them for pain or anything since I have a decently high opioid tolerance.

I did some more research and I've seen a bunch of conflicting info on here and other places about whether you could actually do a CWE with these, so I thought fuck it and I've just given it a try myself.

The method I used was this:

1: Got 20 tabs (160mg codeine / 10g Paracetamol / 600mg Caffeine total) and broke each one in two, placing them in an empty plastic water bottle.

2: Heated some water (not boiling, but would hurt slightly to touch) and gradually added it to the bottle with the tabs until there was just enough so they had all desolved.

3: Put the lid on the bottle and shook the fuck out of it for about 2 minutes.

4: Left it in room temp for about 2 hours. (After this I was already seeing some separation, thick white powder at bottom with clearish liquid on top)

5: Put it in the freezer for 30 mins.

6: Filtered through a wet thick tissue paper.

After all that, it seemed to have gone pretty much the same as any other CWE I've done (I usually use Tylex 30/500 when I have them).

There was a very clear liquid left in the cup I filtered into, with a thick gloopy white substance left on the filter. It didn't look like 10g but it was more than I've ever seen before.

Other than that, the only weird thing was that the liquid that I drank tasted...kind of good? Usually when I drink CWE'd codeine it tastes horrible and I need a chaser immediately, but this had an almost sweet chocolatey aftertaste. It's not something I would choose to drink if it didn't have codeine in it, but it wasn't exactly bad.

I reckon the taste was either due to the Caffeine or Sodium that was left after the CWE, both of which idk if you can even remove.

Anyway, I drank it about 30 mins ago and I'm starting to feel a bit of a feeling creeping up on me, so I guess I'll update this if anything interesting happens. Hope I don't die!",1515724126.0

Mom basically called to say she wants nothing to do with me anymore, of course this was 5 minutes after my session with my therapist. Shortly after, my fiancé who'd I'd been having a lot of problems with..well we broke up. I made the call but she all but forced my hand.

I just chip so it's rare for me to cop two days in a row, and if all goes to plan I'll be getting a stick/log(10 bundles) tomorrow too. I went till ny partner in crimes place, told him about my shit day and asked if he wanted to try to get something. He was up for it but we had no plans worked out and we recently hit one of our go to stores yesterday so that was definitely out. Didn't leave us with a lot of options. I don't like to come out for less than 2 bundles as that's barely enough to get me high for a day.(even though I chip I've always had an unnaturally natural? High tolerance to opiates. 

Anyway, things weren't looking good and I was going to be very surprised if we each went home with the two bundles. I'm not gonna list criminal activity on here but we had a stroke of brilliance hit and we both went home with 4 which is great enough on its own for one day, we could have gotten more but certain places were closing. To put it simply , we don't have to conserve those 4 bundles very much as tomorrow we have enough to split 20 more! And also have money left over for gas and some sorely needed new box of needles(I think I've been reusing the same 50 or so for about 2 months.(yes I know, horrible practice of harm reduction but you do what you gotta when you're poor). So as long as something doesn't get flagged and locked, I can drown myself in 14 bundles over the next few days and have some subs left over for when the shit hits the fan later.

I know this doesn't solve my problems except for a few days but at least I can say fuck off mom and fuck you now ex fiancé for the moment, all the while feeling amazing because we're also lucky enough to have some of the best shit that's been around in months available to us.

How many consecutive days of heroin use til you began to feel withdrawals? if you can remember. By withdrawals, I guess I'm referring to withdrawals that are noticeable, not the symptoms that can be confused with placebo.

2. What dose were you doing when you first started, and what dose when you first felt withdrawal? What was your ROA?

3. I've been using heroin 7 days in a row (a dose of only 15-25mg snorted, gives me strong effects), then I do Kratom for 7 days in a row, and so on. Personally do you think this plan will keep me out of physical dependency (only asking about dependency, not addiction)? I only feel mild depression after the 7 days of dope. And will it keep my tolerance down at 15-25mg? So far I haven't felt the need to increase my dose. I'm not worried about Kratom dependency, I've already been doing it daily for years.

4. What are some signs that you did way too much and need to stop right away so you don't OD?

P.S. I've been through opium withdrawal. I'm quite experienced w/opiates, just not so much with heroin. please don't try and tell me to run from heroin, I'm 1000% aware of how addictive this substance is and that I'm probably spiralling into addiction and that my plan will not work. However, on the very off chance that it might, it would really help if these questions were answered :) thanks! ",1515717316.0

Is it possible to try it once, without using other opiates afterwards or before? Kratom alternative?","So I have around 100mg of heroin from darknet. Before taking it I will have it tested for cuts because it's free to do so where I live and takes about a month.

I have a lot of free prescription concerta (ritalin XR) available but don't use it because I think it has negative health consequences and is habit forming. I could be smoking weed all the time but I smoke only maybe once a month. I don't smoke cigarettes and alcohol is not that interesting to me. I have tried many common stimulants (except cocaine) and psychedelics (except ketamine) and find them interesting them, but don't use them often because of negative health effects and habit formation. You could say I'm a bit on the psychonaut side.

I have never tried any opiates before so my plan was to: 
1. try smoking some heroin, 
2. IV heroin to get the full experience some days/weeks after smoking
3. trow away any heroin left

Negative side effects usually keep me away from doing drugs frequently or at all (MDMA only 4 times a year, don't like the smell of cigarette smoke on me). Do you think I could get away with trying it twice? I've been experimenting with drugs for about 4 years now, I'm 21 and think that I could manage just trying it, but I do like to binge eat sometimes. I already have the H and I've read about opiates online and watched some movies, now I would like to experience the feeling. 

A lot of online posts are about trying H once but then doing other opiates, I would not like to use any other opiates/drugs after this and I am in a fairy stable period in my life. My biggest fear is that I would long for the opiate high for the rest of my life but I doubt that this is reasonable after the first try. Do I long for MDMA? Kinda. Will I do it every few weeks because I could afford to? No, because it has negative consistences (I have MDMA at home as proof of my self control). 

What do you think? Any tips for a newbie? Could I just try kratom instead? I will have someone with me that has tried snorting it but it was a long time ago for her, and she would like to try to IV it in the future. I am in no hurry to try it but I do have it at home, along with a scale with a 1 mg precision and the intention to practice harm reduction. 

Sorry for such a long post but I wanted to be specific. Thank you in advance.

EDIT: I know of SpontaneousH from reddit who wanted to try it once and got addicted ",1515714658.0

Trying to figure out where to go from here...,"I'm only doing this bc I got interventioned so now my whole family knows, and I care enough about them to do this. There's no fuckin' way I'm staying away from opis entirely, though. I've been using opioids on and off for 13 years; I was 13 when I chewed up a handful of hydros, 14 buying morphine 200's off homeless vets, smoking OC80s and BTH and sniffing pharm fent solution at 16. Still never had a problem. Habit got a little worse, still just rare binges, in my early 20's. Then I overdosed and ""quit"". Got back in slowly thru hydros and oxy. Somehow convinced my then-gf who liked to pop pills with me that U-4 was okay, even though heroin was the big no-no. She cried the one time she saw me smoke tar and crack. But she'd do U-4 with me. I did it more, though. Nearly every night for a year. Withdrew every night, and managed to keep my tolerance stable and never got sick on days off. It was almost perfect, except it was destroying my body and I kept turning blue and stopping breathing. I once overdosed on NYE 2015 on U-4 and clonazolam and fell out down a flight of stairs in an old warehouse building. It was a problem so I stopped. Secretly chipped for a few more weeks/months and let my tolerance get out of hand during binges. Stopped again. ""Took a break"" w/ gf eventually bc she couldn't handle my multitude of mental illnesses. Can I really blame her? I had a G of tar in my pocket within 30 minutes of her bringing up the idea, and after a few months of me living in another city smoking heroin alone in the cold and working long shifts we broke up. So I went even harder. Went through a phase where I was living w/ another girl and ended up having to pay for her whole habit for the last couple weeks, shooting goofballs all day every day. 

She left, and I got more U-4. By the end of all this I'd gone through a half ounce of the shit, raw, by myself. My tolerance went through the roof, fast, as I had no one to tell me not to. Eventually, one night, my sinuses were so scabbed and clogged and bloody I couldn't get anymore of the poison into my face. Of course I could have found a way, but I had a moment of clarity, blood pouring out of my face, and I kicked again (that's an interesting story itself).

I've also been addicted to benzos since about 19. I can sort of get by with one or the other daily but not without either. I can get through the sickness. I could tough it out for weeks, months, years maybe even. But I will relapse. And I won't be functional until I do. I know myself, I know my depression and anxiety are too much for me to handle and it's worth dying 50 years early to enjoy 5 more years with the drugs. I've been depressed since I was 6 years old; it's not going away. 

Right now I'm sitting, waiting for my next trip to the bathroom. I took some klonopin, might take some clonidine, been taking some ULDN too to try it out. I can get through these WD's, but it's gonna be hell. I just do not trust myself to make it afterward.

I've decided I want to do maintenance. I guess I could go to the methadone clinic myself tomorrow. My insurance/provider is super tight about bupe, and tbh I'd rather be on 'done than bupe. Everyone tells me getting on methadone would be the worst mistake of my life, but my brain is already fully hooked. I think it was the U-4 that rewired my brain so heavily. I *never* really craved opioids before, beyond a casual enthusiasm for them. After the U-4, it was like I'd never be happy again without the opioids. And I haven't been.

That said, it *does* scare me to commit to a serious sedative like methadone for the foreseeable future/for life. At the same time, it would change everything for me. I know it would allow me to build my life the way I really need to. It would allow me to be optimistic. Nobody will hire me because I ooze depression and anxiety, but on methadone I could really function, I could really become someone.

It's scary, and I don't want to go through another WD if I'm just going to get on maintenance, so I feel like rushed to make the decision. I guess the best course for now is to just endure the WD's and see if by some miracle I can feel semi-ok without any opioids in my system.

Sorry for writing so much, thanks for reading if you did. I'm just really torn atm.

tldr; I've been using for ~13 yrs, 26 now, supposed to be kicking rn and somewhat worried about jumping on maintenance meds but I know I'll relapse if I don't so I probably should huh? I'm also fairly confident about getting off one day if things change.",1515707251.0

The best answer to that question is, ""I got $5-10 and just want to try it before I buy it"" that way it builds trust between the both of you.

7ppcii,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7ppcii/in_defense_of_big_pharma/,5,https://redd.it/7ppcii,anamoohaj,In Defense of Big Pharma,"All the time nowadays you see politicians and talking heads blaming pharmaceutical companies for the opioid crisis, resulting in new laws being passed that generally make it harder for people to get good scripts. This is complete bullshit for several reasons. 

1. Drug use is a choice - all of us chose to take those pills regardless of whether or not we ended up addicted. The consequences are our fault and many people do not get addicted anyways. The media meme of everybody who tries opiates getting addicted is some Nancy Reagan bullshit. 

2. Opiates work wonders for pain that Tylenol and chiropractors do not. It may seem obvious to those on this sub but i see more normies advocating various bullshit treatments like acupuncture to replace opiates. Making it harder to get pills only hurts people who are suffering, whereas degenerate recreational users like myself will get high anyways off something else or obtain the pills anyways. 

3. Opiates are good for the economy - pharmaceutical companies make lots of money, much of which goes to rich ass executives yes... but a lot also goes to taxes that help us all in small but not insignificant ways. Plus pharmaceutical companies create many good jobs not only for scientists but also janitors who clean the offices and truck drivers who deliver the goods. 

4. Painkillers are fucking awesome, so I personally don’t give 2 fucks if some old white dude gets rich off peoples suffering, what do you guys think of the tobacco and gun industries? Alcohol companies? Defense contractors that make drones and missiles that blow up innocent kids in Syria? While pharmaceutical companies are not totally devoid of blame (such as lobbying against weed), they are only doing what they can to protect their business which every company does. 

5. Pills are much safer than heroin. With oxy I know exactly what I’m getting as fake presses are almost always easily identifiable. Making it harder to get scripts only pushes people to heroin which is far more dangerous and unpredictable as far as fent ODs and other bullshit. The heroin business also directly feeds the cartels waging violence on their own people across Latin America. 

 At the end of the day humans consume products for which there is demand, and somebody’s gonna profit off it. So I just want to say thank you science and pharmacologists for inventing pure fun & relaxation, and also pain relief for the suffering in the form of readily consumable pills. Oxy, dilaudid, and opana in particular are some of the greatest innovations in human history. Up there with the telescope and internet in my humble opinion. 

So there you have it people, instead of bitching in lockstep with media hacks and corrupt politicians we should instead be thanking the opioid producing pharma companies for curing our grandmas pain and getting us high.

If yes, any tips on how you managed to do that?

I've always struggled with a gradual increase. I'm trying to fight it by trying to take larger doses but fewer doses, spending more hours each day mildly sick between doses, and only having enough in my system at bedtime to barely be able to sleep through the night without the withdrawal getting intense enough to wake me up too early. Might experiment with adding small amounts of tramadol at times to push the time between doses further.  I made big mistakes before with a lot of redosing, and accidentally taking fentdope for a while which had no legs causing constant redosing.

Also heard dxm might help so I'm trying 5-10mg of that daily. Any thoughts on that? And uldn naltrexone ultra low dose, 20mcg per day. 

And I'm snorting now instead of IV. Theorizing that it has a longer duration so less redosing and thus less tolerance buildup, as well as the lower peak plasma level for a given intensity of high also lessening tolerance development. Budget is a big weapon against further tolerance increase and snorting is more expensive so I'll only be able to afford a smaller tolerance snorting.

I used to inject to save money but then I pushed my tolerance up to my budget limits anyway. Having a psychological barrier against taking out more cash after already doing my monthly drug budget bank withdraw is helpful.

I heard of people having timed safes for dosing, and also not having a debit card , as other ideas.

I hope to taper and quit, but some weeks lately I haven't felt like tapering, after tapering down a bit last month. Just want to try to limit the tolerance damage I'm doing while I'm not tapering.",1515686579.0

When I woke up, I had a weird feeling in my throat - like I had to cough something up but more than just postnasal drip. I also felt really nauseous.  Sure enough when I started coughing it was a mix between postnasal drip and bright red blood. Then I started puking and there didn’t seem to be any blood in the puke but whenever I spit up a loogie it was full of blood. This morning I woke up and coughed up another loogie and this time it had a little blood in it still but much less than before and the blood was much darker than yesterday. Now only like 20% if the loogies have a little bit of blood in them so it seems to be going away. 

Does anyone know what may have happened?? I think that I might have got a bloody nose while I was nodding out and because I was lying on my back the blood dripped down into my airway and a little into my stomach - causing me to cough up blood and puke.

I just need it to calm my heart rate and such from the white stuff.

I'd use at the max a point and probably .2ish of some very decent dope to sleep. Thoughts? Not trying to waste either one and I don't really like just doing speedballs by themselves. I like to nod from H which I have trouble doing with coke in me but if I'm just going to sleep idc about nodding.

For about 16 of those years it was painkillers. Percs, Oxys, whatever I could get my hands on. 
About two years ago I started making real adult money. Expendable income where I could afford to indulge regularly and still put money away and cover all my costs of living. So I was dropping about $100-$200 a week on painkillers. Started off eating 40mg would have me fucking lifted. Like a warm and fuzzy bowl of jello. But, that was a recreational, special occasion habit still at that point. I’d take them only on days off when I had nothing I had to do, and hours to kill watching movies or playing video games. I lived alone so I could get ripped and just float all day long. I’d usually pair up with a bottle of scotch and be swell. After about a year of progression and an increase in frequency, I was usually taking about 15-20mg a day, after I’d get done work, then on days off, I was eating a total of 80-100mg spread throughout the day. Usually take a handful every 4-6 hours.
Then I got “sober”. Stopped drinking. So, I lost that whiskey that would help kick a few pills up a notch so that I’d be straight. That’s when it switched to eating 80-100mg in one sitting to even feel anything. Otherwise, anything less and I’d feel like I wasted my money. I wouldn’t feel high, and I’d just get that like pressure headache. 
Fast forward to about 6 months ago, my financial situation changed and I didn’t have the same kind of expendable income. At that point I was spending about $100-$400 a week on painkillers. I met a connect on the street that was reliable and good to me. I started mixing it up with Xanax and that helped for a while to feel something again. I’d get the nods, but I missed that warm, fuzzy, itchy feeling. 
So, low and behold, going to meet my guy for painkillers, I would always pass the dopeboys peddling their goods. So on a whim one time, I picked up 3 bags. I didn’t know prices, how it was sold, anything. So when my man told me it would be $15, I was pleasantly surprised. I knew dope was cheap, I just didn’t know it was that cheap. So I got it home, and I decided snorting would be my way to go. I definitely wasn’t going to shoot it, and at the time I didn’t know how to go about smoking it or that you even could if it was in powder form and not hard, so I dumped out half a nick bag and snorted it. I waited and waited. Didn’t feel anything. I didn’t know how strong it was at the time so I was being cautious. 
Fast forward to now when I’m much more knowledgeable. I still have never smoked it nor shot it, I still only snort it. However, on a day off when I’m just relaxing and doing my own thing, I’m on par to go through about two bundles a day (28 nick bags), snorting about 2-3 bags at a time. But I don’t even really get that high, that’s just to take the edge off and mellow out a little at this point. If I’m gonna go for a nod, my limit now, just because it’s the furthest I’ve pushed it, is snorting 6 nick bags. 
Now as far as I know, the dope I’m getting are the best bags available on the street, which isn’t necessarily saying much. It’s clean white, and it does the trick, but I’ve still only ever snorted it. 
I’m just getting frustrated because I don’t even feel high anymore, this is just to level off. If I stop snorting, I get super depressed, and usually will feel a little sick on the second and third day, but I’m usually pretty good after that. 

So what I’m asking, is there any hope for me for getting high? Is smoking it worth a shot? If so, ...how? I know the foil method in theory but have never actually done it. Or is there a better method to smoke it? And is it even worth it at this point?
I refuse to shoot it still, so that option is out. I won’t buy pills anymore because they’re just an expensive waste of money, I don’t feel anything. 
Xanax is still ok from time to time, but I usually just nod off on it, whereas I’m trying to get to that warm euphoria where I’m awake and enjoy it. Should I just stop all together and dry out for a while until my tolerance drops and start again down the line? 
Any advice?

**tl;dr** I have a two bundle (28 nick bags) a day dope habit where I’m snorting 2-3 bags at a time and that’s only to get well, not high. The most I’ve snorted at once is 6 nicks. I’ve never smoked it but I’m open to trying. I’ll never shoot it so that’s out of the question. Painkillers do nothing anymore. Do I have any hope of getting high at this rate or should I just quit and start over once I dry out?




Sidenote and funny story, I got in to some trouble and had to go and take a forced drug test. I was doing about a bundle a day at this point. I had actually snorted 3 bags about 5 hours prior to the drug test and was shitting bricks and sweating bullets. Took the test and it came back negative. I have no idea how, but I picked up the bundle I had hidden immediately afterward and snorted 5 bags to celebrate and all was good. Any ideas how that might’ve even happened? I mean it’s definitely dope I’m getting, no question about that. So...?",1515834217.0

Oxy use is out of control. 200mg plus a day. Go through script in a week, then another I acquire, then withdrawals, then wait and repeat.

2 year mark next month. Started with a 7.5 or two after some dental work, then shingles.

Haven't hit rock bottom, I just don't feel good any more but I'm fucking hooked. I have a great family, successful career, great life otherwise. 

I do have a legit pain issue. That's where I'm hitting my head on a wall trying to figure this out. Nerve pain is real and pretty awful, so I have a legit script every month. Lyrica made me hallucinate and gabapentin doesn't do shit. I also overuse Kratom like crazy during withdrawals, then I withdrawal off that and keep using it. Cycle kratom and oxy. Kratom like 30-40g a day when on it.

How the fuck do I stop this? Feb 1 is my goal. I'm gonna be done my script this weekend. With access like I have, how the fuck do I get out? Can't fuck my job up. It's a great 6 figure career that provides for my family and I can't get time off and miss any work right now.

I know some of the answers. But how do I deal with the very real pain? And the constant access? Even if I stop my script, my wife is weaning down after major surgery and will have pain meds around for at least 3 more months. 

I feel very defeated. Went through 500 mg in 2 days, I should be high right now but I can't get there any more. Won't switch to H or anything harder. Refuse to even think of it. I've taken up some new hobbies to try and help.

I'll try tl:dr. Wanna be done, tolerance is fucked, but will be around pain meds for a while and have a legit pain issue. Won't go to anything harder. 

Crazy to think, anyone been in a similar situation this I am?

Maybe if they saw the love, support and compassion that's spread around here...just maybe they wouldn't hate us so much. 

To be honest, I think the rest of the world could use some lessons from us. They could only hope to be able to go online into a group of thousands of strangers about their shitty day, their fuckboy boyfriend, or a simple vent and have those strangers ACTUALLY GIVE A SHIT.

For me, being ""clean"" means you're not taking/doing any drugs. You're not drinking, smoking weed, or on a replacement medication.

Not abusing drugs is what I, personally, call ""sober."" For a few months - I want to say five, but it might be closer to six - I haven't abused opiods at all. Before that date there was a few months where I still shot up or whatever, but it was rare - less than once a week.

So these days I strictly take my prescriptions as indicated. I might drink a few times a month, smoke weed even less, and I'll never turn down some pretty white girl. So, obviously, I'm not ""clean,"" but I consider myself ""sober."" To be honest, I'll never be ""clean"" - I'm going to be taking pain killers the rest of my life. Or at least if I want to be able to function. I suppose if I'm okay with never getting out of bed and shitting into a bedpan I could stop taking opiods, but, well - fuck that.

So I'm not abusing any drugs - I'm not getting in the least bit high. I'm not sniffing crushed roxies, I'm not playing with pointy rigs, and I'm not taking more than directed. Hell, I'm not even skipping a dose today so I can take extra tomorrow.

But I still don't want to say I'm ""clean,"" so I say ""sober"" instead.

No more dying, crying, sneezing, diarrhea, etc. This day was ROUGH

7q0rdo,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7q0rdo/posted_this_in_ropiatesrecovery_but_i_thought/,33,https://redd.it/7q0rdo,AgathaCrustie,"Posted this in r/OpiatesRecovery, but I thought that it was worth posting here, too.","This post isn’t meant to offend anyone. I’m not passing any judgment on active users. I was pretty deep into my own heroin addiction for a long time, and even though I’m clean now, it hasn’t been for long at all. When I was active in my addiction, it was incredibly dark. Anyway, I posted this over in r/OpiatesRecovery, but I wanted to share it with you guys because I just really like a lot of the people here. I don’t get to talk about my addiction/sobriety with a lot of people. I live far away from my family and friends (and they weren’t truly aware of what was going on!), and didn’t use with anyone other than my husband. It’s really been so refreshing to communicate with people in this sub. I’m really grateful that I discovered this community. Anyway, on to the post:


**54 days clean of heroin, and I just have to say...**

That I don’t miss the game that goes along with it. At ALL. 

I don’t miss being so physically sick. Not being able to get out of bed, vomiting 20 times/day (and pissing myself while vomiting, because of the intensity), not having the energy to clean myself and change clothes (even after said vomiting and pissing myself). 

I don’t miss the severe depression. Waking up every morning and just wanting to die. Wanting to die not just because I didn’t have drugs, but because I was so tired of the drug life and what problems came along with it. The strained relationships with family, friends and my husband. The impact on my self-esteem. The guilt. 

I don’t miss having NO money. I don’t miss having to do dirty things just to get my hands on a couple of bucks. I don’t miss not being able to afford food and pay my bills. 

I don’t miss the dealers. 
“I’ll be there in five minutes.”
45 minutes go by, I’m vomiting in my car, sweating and hurting and crying. The dealer is nowhere to be found. Either he would finally come around, or I would go home empty-handed, sick and even more depressed. Then, later on that night or on the next morning, dboy would *finally* be ready to see me. No matter what time it was or how I was feeling, I was ready to go when he was ready to see me. Like a hopeless little puppy, I succumbed to his bullshit and did what he said - because I needed my drugs. 

I don’t even miss the “high.” Or, should I say, the “feeling of getting somewhat well after withdrawing.” My situation was so hellish that I was using heroin to escape, to temporarily forget about my problems; however, the heroin I was using to forget my problems was just creating even bigger ones and making the old ones even worse. Now that I’m living without heroin in my life, I have fewer problems, and they are more manageable.

For me, the cons of heroin addiction *heavily* outweigh the pros. Even though I have the occasional rough day, and I still deal with depression/bipolar disorder, I know that the life I’m living now is the one I want to continue living. I didn’t have a life when I was using heroin. All I had was heroin, and I’m over that bitch. 

Just some thoughts that popped into my head as I’m going through my day today. As I think about where I’ve been and where I am now, I look forward to my life now. I’m excited for the future. I didn’t want a future when I was using heroin, and I definitely don’t miss that.

Thanks for reading, and I hope everyone is having good days! ",1515800515.0

It bubbles a little on the foil and then runs into the brown colour before going black when it's done, it's supposed to be pure stuff and has the nice vinegar smell, It smokes quite a lot and is a little bit harsh and doesn't really taste like the stuff I've had before, it has a nice effect but just a bit skeptical about it.

It was 30mg for 2 days and on the last day i ate 40 mg (half an OP 80) but from august to november i was doing a lot of oxy but 30 mg would still get me nodding.

i’m wondering if i do 15 mg (half a blue) tomorrow will i still get high? i did have physical wd’s around like november end. i’m just trying to maximize my money this semester cause i spent something like 1,500$ last semester and i know that’s not a huge habit for some of you guys but as a college student i really can’t afford it like that...

Also i know the OP 80’s are fucking horrible for your tolerance and i’m gonna try and stay away from them altogether. If you guys know how to keep your T down when you’re taking just roxies then please let me know. 

anyway if you guys have any tips at all on reducing tolerance rapidly (i can wait to do the oxy if it means i’ll get higher) that would be amazing. i’ll check the sidebar anyway but i just wanted to hear your guys’ opinions and what has worked for you in the past.

Luckily there’s PUBG lmao.

I find that the pills shoot better than strips.  Been doing it just about daily for the last 2 months or so. For myself at least, the naltrexone appears to prevent a tolerance from developing. I get as high as I did off the first one, every single day. I also have not experienced any signs of physical dependency. Mental dependency is another story, obviously, or I probably wouldn’t do it almost every day. I don’t do any bupe the day I get my vivatrol injection, but later that day or the next day, I’m right back to it. 

Ya ya, I know, why  go on vivatrol if you’re going to keep shooting opiates? Well, it wasn’t my intention. I would hope that just about everyone in this sub can at least understand how these things have a way of just... happening. 
Also, I got off dope to appease my girl. Subs don’t show on the home drug tests she gives me. 
I acknowledge that I am dishonest and that this behavior is unhealthy in every way. However, I am no longer shooting dope and at risk of dying from fetanyl.

I spilled the beans to my family about my problem (which has gotten out of control) and have been given an ultimatum; detox/rehab, or cut out of their life.

I'm all set to enter the county's only free detox/rehab center (for broke people like me) as soon as a bed is available. I know nothing about the place, reviews are scarce though I take it doesn't have a sterling reputation compared to luxury rehab centers. 

I have never done anything like this before, and have no idea what to expect. The literature they gave me makes it sound like a prison. I can't bring anything to read that isn't ""spiritual"" to take my mind off my situation(and my feelings) when I'm bored, but my main worry is what's going to happen when I start to hurt.

For anyone who's done detox before, do you have any advice? What can I expect? How sympathetic are they to the pain and withdrawal symptoms? Will they give me something for the pain and to sedate me and help me sleep? What about for the anxiety? Do I have to request/demand/fight for it? Will I be treated like a prisoner? And assuming I'm not court ordered to be there, can I leave on my own volition?

I had a fever of 101.8 so I went to the doctor. I wasn’t positive it was an abcess cause the skin was hard but it wasn’t that warm. I was actually convinced that I had the flu but the doctor told me I didn’t!!

So anyways.. fast forward to 1230 pm and I can’t even bend my god damned arm. I go to the hospital and was just discharged an hour ago. I was there for 8 hours. 

I guess the whole point of this is if you think you could even possibly have an abcess then GO TO THE ER!!! They numbed the area then stuck a needle deep into my arm. They said there was no head on the abcess but I was persistent and they ended up draining about a dime sized hole filled w blood and yellow pus.

I’m way passed pissed at this point I understand no one wants to deal with an addict but fuck EMS in my area treat you like the scum of the earth. I had obvious injuries , broken eye socket , swollen ass face , bruises everywhere. I end up at the hospital refuse any treatment not sure why but I was pretty livid. I was high out of my mind why did they let me leave ? Anyways the discharge me and I stay in lobby trying to get people to let me use their phone. No one wanted to fucking help. Finally someone told me if I asked nicely at the desk I would get a bus token. I appreciate this info but I was fucking 30 minutes away from home and no bus will drive that far. I still have this token haha. Someone eventually told security and the escorted me out. I refused to leave so they called the cops. I’m not sure what they were going to do so I just walk opposite direction. Eventually I just stop and talk to them I was nice to them because I was pretty beat up already and I didn’t want to have to fight two cops. They ask if they can search me and they find a rig on me , no black because it had fallen out of a hole in my pocket thank god , two grams of wax and some loose bills because earlier that day I had scammmed my uncle out of $200 and asked boss for $200 in advance. It all went to xanax and BTH. I gave $50 to friend for keeping his mouth shut to help me scam unk he ended up snitching me out. We are not friends anymore but my uncle understood and didn’t ask me to pay him back. But anyways the cops find this I’m not sure why they detained me but they did and I ended up saying “ if you arrest me I will kill myself “ again do not say this to a cop !!! He immediately said “ are you sure you want to say this “ being dumb as I am I said yes. I get handcuffed and try to convince the officer not to take me to jail. He was silent the whole time. That fucker drove me even farther to a psych ward and by this point I was super fucking livid blood boiling !!! The xan rage hit so hard I was a xan hulk. Fighting cops , security, and nurses. They ended up tranquilizing me. Strap me to my bed I don’t think it was strong enough I woke up a few times and thought I was at home. When I wake up I find out I’m on 51/50 watch , not knowing where I am , felt like I died and got stuck in purgatory. I was there for about a week and I’m lucky I got out. I had to call a lawyer. They were trying to keep me in their for a month. I met some cool people. A professor, couple veterans , and some people who admitted themselves for detox. All I did was watch TV all day. All you could do. You could only talk the doc once a day she came in at 8 am everyday. She ended up giving me klonipin and I ended up snorting it with a buddy I had in there. My roommate layed in bed all day he was recovering from a meth binge. Everyone had to wear green scrubs and these socks with grip at the bottom. They tired to get me on depression meds but I never took them. I felt like they forced me to be happy. I felt like whatever I said didn’t matter because I was labeled crazy. Fuck those places and fuck shitty nurses. Like I said no one wants to deal with an addict but for fuck sake have some compassion. ",1515926511.0

Our love we have sings the most beautiful hymn.

Why stay in this misery if you feel so alone?
Because he was all I had, when I felt nothing but bone.

(X-post /r/suicidewatch)","As in, they're so obvious about it that they'll ignore every message asking to hang out but freak out if I'm a bit late to get their weed. Most of them just want weed, although one of them I think enjoys straight up psychologically fucking people, and she's great at it. She at one point got a group of 3 people to gang up on me because her girlfriend had suggested we go to a bar and I said ""as long as (X) is ok with that). Which is what I would have done to a hetero/non-trans couple, but apparently it was a HUGE misstep because she still doesn't talk to me the same. I should stress that she was watching the conversation unfold and we were literally just saying ""Val speak up would it be OK you can end this now"" -_- she must get off on it.

I don't know what to do. I know they're just using me and they know it too, but as they've even mentioned before, I have nowhere else to turn to. Even my parents have flat out told me they don't love me.

So. In a world where my ""friends"" leverage that ""friendship"" over me for whatever they please, how am I meant to escape that clearly toxic situation? It's not like I can just go to the friend shop and pick up the new manipulation-free model.

I guess my question would be, where do you find quality friends? People who see you as someone to help instead of an asset? I've never been suicidal when I had an SO because I knew I was brightening someone's life, now... I'm basically just an emotional plaything.

I've tried church (although I'm not religious and their dedication to converting me definitely showed), smoking outside concerts and raves (I don't smoke and am aware of the health risks but I'm desperate, until my ""friends"" find me and drown me out of the conversation this has been the most effective), and just meeting people from the internet and making sure no one knows.

I'm sure one of you must have been in this situation before. Where can I find a legitimate, non-sociopathic human being? I just want one friend that's all, even if it's just someone here I can talk to on Skype. Just something yknow?

I bought dope with Cliff this week and it went well. I wasn't notaicably scammed or robbed. 


Yesterday was interesting, I was at the end of my supply but confident I wouldn't get sick. While still under the influence of dope, I started feeling stranger to the negative end of the spectrum. WHen I'm high doses of dope for an exctended period of time, I get weird dream flashes. Well apparently, these happen stronger and earlier in the evening when coupled with more sleep depredation.

Just dark flash-backs and daydreams in the middle of doing the usual goofing around, movies, talking about movies, and the sciences. Especially when engaged in the sciences. Fit for a more detailed post of it's own.

&nbsp;

All of the previously mentioned aside, I've answered cliff minimally. He texted like four times practically begging for a phone call in one. I was thinking, thinking and asked about him getting subs from his boy as planned and stated by him days earlier. Upon asking about such things.. he did text once about ""good news"" but now he's not saying in text form what the good news is. Nothing of what I asked him just more requests for my ear. 


He finally texted that he didn't care if I answered, ""can you stop off on your way home, PLEASE. **This will help you as well!** 

&nbsp;?


Oh why, oh why? Why can't I just be told what scheme is being cooked up. There is obviously some bullshit available to be had if I were to **go out of my way** and stop by his house to have a conversation + waste time doing nothing watching movies or tv. Doing nothing is fine if that's what I want to do but I reserve the right to do nothing anywhere else that I see fit.

Why can't he just tell me why he needs to talk so urgently. If it was so urgent it would involve answers to my questions and some informative details. 


Usually when someone wants you to answer the phone without saying why, it is because they want to ask you to do something. In this case to do or to sacrifice something. 


That sacrafice is time, effort and money or a combination of the three. Time equates to reduced relaxation or less ""me"" time. Typically coupled with a task.

&nbsp;

If I had 0 subs right now sas opposed to a few days supply l, then I'd be down. I'd jump at the opportunity to go to the atm on Cliff's behalf so he'd have money for dope and would throw me a couple of bags. Before he knew me he'd have to find an addict who drives or take a cab, or take a walk to use his atm card.

I'm guessing he wants me to take his card to the atm to help him pull out the last of his dope money, get scraps and maybe part with my last $50 to $80. If I came to ""talk"" I could easily avoid losing my own money but by showing up I'd increase the likelyhood of being duped into running a physical errand.
?.
Just say no? If he think's I'm not home he can't show up at my house to break my peace nor can he if I'm not home and not at his home, elsewhere. How can I say now on the texter now without knowing to what I'm saying no.


&nbsp;

I started writing this on and off over an hour ago. He just sent me a text over an hour after his last. He reiterated his previous text more succinctly. ""is that ok ? u can stop in when you get back to home street?""


Then another follow-up message more recently, an hour after the prior (had this post drafted and waited to post0:

""very important.."" A longer message, well two more messages but all emphasizing how important it is we speak and that it'll only bee 1-2 minutes. Before he said 2-3 minutes. Even if it was 2-3 minutes, it would end up being 10-20 minutes in real life.

Oh I still wonder what it could be so important and beneficial for me.

**Update:**

Cliff promised via his last text, or at least said: 

**""It's about buns/blue/subs. I'm sure you're near empty, I can help you if you ever answer""**

I wanna just answer, I'm good but I also prefer he don't know I'm sitting on any amount of subs. 

If I was without subs maybe I'd be more attentive. Nonetheless, I already texted indicating my interest in subs. I don't care about those other things at this point and they're probably empty promises involving a who lot of work from me.

&nbsp;


#short version

My presence is being requested, I'm practically getting texted in a desperate manner. My most recent text was ""I'm sure you are home by now""

Basically even tho the sale pitch says the outcome of talking to him would be good for me, I have a feeling he's gonna push some kind of sales pitch and give me a hard time taking no an for answer just as he is persistent right now in texting me.

**Follow up:**
He creepily texted me late last night, ""you must be home by now"" then in the morning texted me to ""text me when you wake up"". 


In the past, or if I was dry I'd be willing to bike to the ATM in sub-freezing weather to help get money off of Cliff's ATM card so he could get dope and throw me a small reward. 

He really thinks he can ask me to hustle to the ATM (his card) before work because it worked in the past. This is probably one of the reasons he always lies about getting subs, he knows if I actually had a meaningful amount of subs it would prove difficult to get me to run errands for him.

If you are ever caught in a drug house never submit to any field sobriety tests or answer any questions simply demand an attorney. What you say can make the difference of being arrested or let go in a situation like this. What you possess is a different story but the attorney can win a motion to suppress or a 991 or 995 motion as long as you keep your mouth shut about that.",1515897160.0

I know transdermal use is out of the question because I'm pretty sure it has a very low bioavailability via that route. I was thinking sublingual would be a decent route but the bioavailability via that route is pretty low 30% via that route. I looked on Bluelight and people have talked about extracting the buprenorphine from the patches by cutting them up into pieces and soaking them in water or alcohol for a few hours or days to get all the buprenorphine out and use the solution for IV use although the monkey water method should also work in theory if one doesn't like needles, does anyone have experience with those extraction techniques?

This kid we’ll call, Mohammad, called me up offering me a $20 spot for gas and a free smoke up for a lift to meet the Mexicans for some of their finest BTH. I obliged, and off we went. Once we got to the train, the cartel boyz told us which ally was our turn. Once we got to the front, Mohammad jumps out of the front seat to go cop his tasty treats. Little did I know, that this pile of shit, Mohammad, had only half of the amount that they expected. So I’m sitting in the driver seat minding my own business when I see him start taking off this watch and then they pulled him into the Durango. As this is going down I’m freaked out because I didn’t fuck with these guys and another car pulls up behind me but just sat there staring at my car. It was another set of Mexicans so I thought for sure I was about to get robbed, kidnapped or killed. After 5 minuets goes by Mohammad jumps out of the Durango with a FAT ASS BLACK EYE and a bloody nose & no watch. He jumps into my car freaked out obviously, we sat there until the lead whip pulled out.
As we get onto the highway, I freaked out on him for pulling shady ass shit and asked for my $20 for gas. He’s silent most of the way home and never told me what they said to him but once we got back he tossed me a ballon!!! He said they gave him 3 total which woulda been a 1.5 
So Mohammad got beat up, yet he managed to still get the good stuff. Mohammad never got a ride again.... I still look back at this and wonder why I didn’t ask for the gas before going but I wonder even more about why they still gave him anything? Maybe because they are good dudes or just know he’d keep coming back no matter what?

so I have a opiate dependency, my favoured ROA is snorting H. But I've injected it a few times before tho and I have some questions about doing it correctly for harm reduction.
I know the best thing would be not do it, but I don't need to hear that. I'm doing it anyway and just want some info so I don't fuck it up completely. Thanks.

So I've taught it all to myself as good as I could with online information. Stupid, I know, but I don't really care and yea it's been a lot trial and error.

So I take the heroin powder and put it on a spoon with some water and some like, citric acid (not sure what's it called in English). Well anyway some kind of acid bc apparently you need that bc the Heroin is not completely water solulable, but idk, I've heard different things online.
But the stuff around here (brown rocks/powder) definitely needs acid, favourable ascorbic acid, that's what I've read everywhere. I don't have any ascorbic acid unfortunately but the stuff I have is supposed to work too and it's not like I'm shooting up several times a day so it would become really dangerous with the stuff I put in there but just like, once in a while when I have so little left it wouldn't do anything when I sniffed it or whatever.
Like, over the time I've used it (p much 1 year now) I maybe injected maybe 8 times in total.

Then I stir and heat it up and it turns into a brown/golden liquid with some solid part that floats on the top.
Since you're supposed to suck it up through a filter the solids obviously don't go up the syringe. The liquid in the syringe is sort of a golden/brown colour and when I inject it it definitely has an effect. But I do wonder about all the stuff that's been left behind.

Is that just trash that the heroin has been cut with and goes into the bin?
Or didn't all the heroin dissolve in water bc I didn't use enough acid or didn't heat it up long enough idk?

Would appreciate some advice.
Thanks!!

I’m gonna know most everyone there, I work with them and all, though there will be a few significant others there I don’t know but my problem is fourfold: 1- this will be a social event/environment, not a work one so it’s not the same as usual. 2- there will be a few people there I don’t know. 3- there’s gonna be ALOT of people there and that’s gonna be overwhelming. 4- the woman I’m in love with is gonna be there presumably with her husband and that’s the biggest single trigger. I do know him but it’s always nerve wracking when I meet him. I bring all this up cause last year I took a pill to calm down but it didn’t help that much; this year I intend to take two 10mg hydros and 1mg xanax to deal with it. My question is if y’all think this will do the trick. My tolerance is 50mg to get high and that’s with proper potentiation (but not with Xanax). I’m just looking to feel comfortable around all these people, not get high af. Just relaxed and easy going. Do you think combined with the Xanax I’ll be good? 1mg xanax usually calms me down pretty well but I want to enjoy the evening too so I’m taking the hydro, otherwise I would be calm but miserable. I know this isn’t the best way to deal with anxiety long term and honestly if He wasn’t gonna be there I would probably just take the Xanax but you know. Anyways, any help would be appreciated, thx. 

Update: well the party was a success lol. Managed to have fun, mostly avoided Him and Her but not awkwardly, we just were hanging out with different groups really. Took .5mg/30mg xanax/hydro plus a few beers and felt very relaxed and easy going. Could have probably hung with the two of them but it just happened out differently. Just a little bit of a downer seeing them kiss at one point but that’s just the hand I’ve been dealt. Took 50mg of hydro with potentiation when I got home and am chilling hard.

STORY!!‼️
(I ramble quite a bit when I’m high PLUS I have ZERO friends who use. Thus, my fam here are the only peeps I have to share such shit with.) 😬😬


Hello, my fellow dope f(r)iends! I hope everyone is happy and safe and high tonight/today! 😎 To start this post off, I’m gonna give ya’ll a little bit of back story on myself. (I do apologize if a “little” turns into “a lot” as I tend to ramble when I’m rocked, as I’ve already mentioned. Haha.) 😁

Anyway, so I’ve been trying my “best” to live clean and sober over the past 4-5 months. But as yinz guys know (haha... 😉).... shit’s fuckin’ tough. In an attempt to keep me clean, my parents have revoked my driving privileges.  I’m an adult, however I currently live under their roof. Also, not having a vehicle is a HUGE deterrent for me when it comes to using. So, I’m not completely opposed to it as I’m truly trying to get clean. (Not that I haven’t found a couple ways around it though, buuuuut they’re both very risky and I sincerely try not to use them much at all.) I suppose that I should also let you guys know that I’m not ALWAYS this lucky with the law (which I’ll get into shortly) and I do have a couple pending drug charges. 😕 I think that’s all the background really needed (aaaand probably then some... hey... I warned you... hahaha.) so I’ll begin my story now about my brush with the ol’ 5-OH.

Okay, so this happened to me about a week or so ago. As I already stated, I don’t currently have a vehicle. But I was feeling especially desperate for a bit of a fix AND I didn’t have enough money to get my d-boy to make the two hour round-trip for him to come to me. (Plus the last time he made a delivery to me it was a smallish “order” AND I accidentally shorted him about $15, which was never even spoken of. Yeah... he’s pretty fuckin’ rad.) SO, this left me with my only other option, which was jacking one of my folk’s cars in the middle of the night. (Yeah, I fucking suck as a human, I know.) Which is NOT an easy task and is also quite risky for me. (God forbid anything happen to the vehicle while I had it because I would be grade-A fucked in that case. Same goes for getting a ticket.)

Soooo, as you can imagine, I was trying to make the (2 hour round-) trip as speedy as possible, while also trying my best to be quite careful. Fortunately, the trip to meet my mans went off without a hitch and I actually made it to him in 45 minutes, as opposed to the nmvg, AND had zero issues. My d-boy was quite prompt (per usual), and after stopping to get some gas, I was on my way home! Aaaand this is where I fucked up. 

After my extremely successful trip to meet my mans n’at, I got cocky. I was also still in a rush to get home so that neither of my folks would be any the wiser that I’d made a break for it in the middle of the night. So, as I’m going about 80 in a 55, I decided that THAT would be the perfect time to send my d-boy a giant, heartfelt, “thank you for being the fucking MAN” text. (DON’T TEXT AND DRIVE, KIDS! It’s dangerous and straight-up moronic.) So as I’m pulling this brilliant fucking move, BAM! Berries and cherries. Mother. Fucker.

Sooo, I’m going 78 (as it turns out) in a 55, I’m texting, I apparently crossed over into the passing lane and then back into mine, AND in my cup holder I have, roughly, 2.5 buns and 6 or 7 empty stamp bags. I. Am. Fucked. As I’m being pulled over, I grab the dope and the empties and shove them in my sweater pocket. All I can think is that I am SO fucking fucked. Fuck. 

- [ ] Anyway, the officer comes up to my window, asks for my paperwork and what-not, informs me of why he and his partner pulled me over, and then asks where I was headed and if I had anything to drink. Trying my best to seem like a good person, I told him that I hadn’t been drinking (true) and that I’d run into the city to pick my drunk friends up from the bar and deliver them safely home, which I had just done, and was now on MY way home (lie. lie. fucking lie.). At this point, due to my erratic driving, he decides to check my eyes with his flashlight. Fuck. Upon seeing that SOMETHING was up, he asked me again if I was sure that I hadn’t had anything to drink at all. So, then I thought, well, shit, if I say “no” again he’s gonna start suspecting that I’m up to something else. So I said “Oh, actually officer, I forgot that I did have 1 drink after I got off of work and before I came down to get my friends. Then he, politely, asked me to step out of the car. Fucking fuck.

At this point I’m thinking, okay, what if he decides to pat me down and I have this dope in my pocket? No bueno. So, even though it may look weird, I need to take my sweater off. (Now, it’s been -7 To about 5 degrees here most days, especially at night. However, thank the LORD this happened to be a very random evening where it was unseasonably warm.) So even though it still may have looked odd, I had to ditch that pocket full of sunshine. Aaaaand, as I slipped my sweater off, sat it on the seat beside me, and got out of my car... he thought nothing of it. Thank you, Jesus.

Sooo, at this point, as his partner finished up running all of my info, he administers a field sobriety test on me. And then, since I “lied to him/forgot” about having a drink earlier, he gave me a breathalyzer as well. Now, obviously, I blew a 0.00. But at this point I’m still thinking that there are many ways that this could go AND that I’m probably still fucked. HARD.

And then the most magical words in all the land escaped his mouth... “Okay, bud. Slow it down, stay off your phone, and please be careful on your way home.” And that was it! No ticket, no warning, no nothing. If he would’ve let me, I would have dropped to my knees right then and there (on the side of a 4 lane highway at 1:00 am, in the dead of winter) and given him and his partner the best head either one of them has ever had. (I hate to toot my own horn. But I don’t have a lot going for me aside from the fact that I’m fairly cute and that I give truly incredible BJs. Especially to good looking, honest to God straight [just very horny] dudes. Many a straight bro has truly had his mind blown, amongst other things, during the process of me doin’ my thing down there. Haha. Sorry. That was a hella random tangent on how awesome I am at fellatio. LOL. My B, yo! I told yinz guys that I’m a rambler. Hahahaha.)

Okay. WOW. That was fucking LONG. So, to the one or two of you who actually read through all of this (For whatever reason. Perhaps you’re a patron saint? Haha.) Thank you SO much! I apologize AGAIN for the MONSTER LENGTH. (That’s what he said? LOL.) And I hope you at least somewhat enjoyed my story/storytelling technique. 🙂🙃🙂🙃🙂

ANYWAY, what about you guys? What magical experiences of running into the po-po, where you definitely should’ve been busted for at least paraphernalia, did you miraculously escape? Feel free to be better at condensing than I. Or ramble on like an asshole motherfucker in the same vein as my gay ass. Hahaha. Either way, I’d love to hear some of ya’lls experiences!!! 😘😍

TLDR: I got pulled over for driving erratically after doing some dope-ski AND while having the remaining dope-ski on my person/in the car. So I lied and said I had had 1 alcoholic beverage earlier and had just DDed my drunk friends home. I was then administered a field sobriety test and a breathalyzer and was then sent on my merry way with a smile and a “drive safe”. How’s about you’se guys? I’m sure ya’ll have some gooooood ones! Haha. 😍

❤️ BE SAFE OUT THERE AND MUCH LOVE TO YA’LL, FAM!! ❤️

Supposedly you're not meant so sniff it since its not water soluble but I have done it a lot and found that it worked, although a lot properly has gone to waste when i think about it now. So therefore I begun smoking it at have been for half a year daily now, always the brown, This friday I IV'ed for the second time in my life, not a pleasent experience, But tomorrow I'm starrting rehab and since I don't want to be sick until I start there I just bought some H of some street dealer I don't know. Although I can tell its white heroin, so I was just wondering if any of you have experience with Brown & White and what the difference is? Could you perhaps share some of you're knowledge? Thanks for reading and happy nods to you all!

**So you want to snort heroin?**

**You will need**

* heroin

* a clean surface

* a card, razor or other cutting device

* optional: scale

* optional: water, preferably sterile

**Dose**

With little to no tolerance, start with a match head sized bump. Redose every 10-15mins until you're at a level comfortable for you. If you click better with numbers, 2mg is a good place to start, too. Keep adding 1.5-2mg every 10 minutes until you get to a level you like.

**How to**

* Put a small amount of dope on your clean surface

* Cut it into a small bump, or a measured bump

* Blow all of the air out of your chest

* Gently sniff one bump into your nostril, don't sneeze, you're going to want to

* Pour a tiny bit of water in you hand or in the bottom of a bottle cap

* Tilt your head and drip the water down your nose. Sniff until you can taste the drip a little. You don't want a TON. Just a little. Pretty much only do this if your nose is dry or nothing has hit you after 10-15mins.

* Repeat until high

---

**So you want to shoot heroin?**

**You will need**

* heroin

* a metal spoon/ladle/can bottom

* sterile/cool boiled water

* cotton

* cutting device

* a 28-31g needle (higher the better)

* 1cc syringe

* tourniquet (shoelace, latex, phone cord)

* lighter**

* citric acid**

* optional: scale

* optional: alcohol wipe


**Dose**

With little to no tolerance, I'd advise that you do NOT start here. However, make sure your dope isn't cut with fent first and foremost. Start with 3mg. This isn't going to be amazing, it's to be safe. If you can't spare two shots, you shouldn't be shooting. You can always add. If you only have one rig: 8mg max no tolerance.

**How to**

* Cut how much and put it in your spoon

* Mix with water and wait for mixture to blend, stir a little

* If you have heroin #3 (Afghan, brown), you need citric acid and a flame to make a solution. Add citric to your spoon and heat it up. Stir.**

* Put cotton in spoon

* Look for the hole in the needle. Point it down toward the bottom of the spoon, place it on top of your cotton and draw. (This filters your solution)

* Wash those hands and your arm, or try to sanitize the best you can

* Tie off your arm -- don't knot it, wrap it around and hold it in place with your teeth

* Feel for a good vein, always closest to the crook of your arm. Look for ones you can see through the skin clearly.

* Enter the vein, hole facing up, needle pointing towards your shoulder, almost parallel to the arm, you'll know when you're in

* Register: pull back and watch the little bit of blood enter the barrel 

* Note: if there's PAIN at any point or no blood registering, pull out and try again with a different needle. NEVER REUSE A NEEDLE.

* Slam that shit (gently and slowly press the plunger down). With the needle still in your arm, let go of your tourniquet

* Pull out, gently and slowly. It will sting. Wipe your arm, cap your needle.

So you want to ~~boof~~ put heroin in your ass? 

**You will need**

* heroin

* an ass

* oral syringe 

* sterile water

* cotton

* lighter**

* citric acid**

* optional: lube

* optional: scale

**Dose**

Fair warning that boofing is actually strong as fuck. With no tolerance, I would start at 40mg. Not entirely sure on this number as it's a little on the safe side.

**How to**

* Follow previous shooting steps. Mix your solution, filter it and draw it up.

* Without an oral syringe, you can use a regular needle syringe. Break the tip off.

* Lube up the tip

* Slide it in your bung hole and press the plunger down

* Pull out and lay on your side or stomach for half an hour

---

**So you want to smoke heroin?**

**You will need**

* heroin

* a short straw

* foil

* lighter

**Dose**

You can't smoke ECP (well, you can, but it's a waste). Only tar and gunpowder. You also need to breathe on gunpowder to make it tar, so you can really only smoke tar. No tolerance, half a pea size ball.

**How to**

* Tear a strip of foil and fold it in half, tear it in half

* Take one half and make v shape boat thing

* Heat the sides of the foil with your lighter

* Put BTH in the foil, farthest from the corner you're holding it with and closest to your mouth

* Position lighter several inches under foil, away from the dope. You don't want them to touch, you don't want to ignite the dope. Keep your straw close to ball but don't suck it up

* Inch closer to the dope while heating it, it will liquefy and become smoke. Suck that smoke down, don't make the dope too hot and move the lighter away when the flame dies

This shit takes practice, not gonna lie. I've seen it smoked a ton but never done it, mostly because I suck at it!

Some lingo and wise words.

Afghan, #3, brown - all the same shit. Powdery heroin that's beige.

ECP, #4 - whitish powder not cut with fent. Can be grayish and sometimes even a very very light brown depending on where it's from. Almost never pure white, don't trust that shit.

BTH - black tar, it's, well, black. 

China white - don't fucking buy this if you're a newb. 90% of the time it's got fent. Which will kill you.

Always practice harm reduction. Never use needles twice. Never share. Use the guides and the health information. Always have Narcan on hand. If your state has a needle exchange, use it. If your state doesn't have a needle law, use the pharmacy. If not, go to the exchange. Ask on reddit, there's tons of us that have spares. Buy them on the dark net. Ask your dboy. Anything. Just stay safe, and don't be stupid, especially with this shit.

And please, if you're starstruck with the glitz and glamor of us heroin addicts, enjoy it from afar. It's hell.

It's highly unlikely that I'll have enough money tomorrow to get another one and opana withdrawals are super evil. And while I'm not opposed to taking my licks like a grown up, I have important stuff to do tomorrow and have to be functional.

That said, I've decided to shoot the remainder in the morning. I have small gauge rigs on hand and am considering shooting into the back of my hand for ease of access *and* the fact that shooting into my arm somehow weirds me the **fuck out**. A friend of mine shoots into her hand and she does it so fast and matter-of-factly, that it's ingrained in my head that it will be fast and simple for me as well ;) lol.

Can anyone throw me some tips please? 

Food for thought :

- I know the risks of shooting pills, especially ER variants. These don't gel up as far as I'm aware.
- My tolerance is snorting 20mg at a time, although I snorted 30mg today and fucking loved the extra boost.
- I've never shot anything before, ever.

**UPDATE** I ended up snorting it and feeling not very much, which was why I wanted to shoot in the first place.
Healthy or not, my friend just crushed up some opana, put it in a spoon with water, heated it (which I urged against) sucked it up with a small cotton blob and shot it. By all accounts, she shouldn't have heated it (heating ER variants is super-awful-terrible for your heart and valves) and she should have used a wheel filter, I assume, instead of cotton. Nonetheless,  I won't be shooting this week it seems.",1515991979.0

Never told me about the repercussions of long term use. 

I have been on subs for 3 years now for a ""security blanket"". It was nice knowing that if i found any pills they wouldn't work, besides H that is. 

I was never told how bad long term sub use was, how long it takes to get off it, how it increases depression, makes you moody as fuck, kills your energy and drive, screws with social skills, and kills sex drive. I literally replaced one addiction with another. I always thought that's just the person ive become and didn't think my sub use had anything to do with it

Even though i used sub as a security blanket i still relapsed, went a year and a half before the first relapse, binged for 4 months and got sober for some time (6+ months, stopped keeping track after 6). Then low and behold i recently relapsed again for a week or 2. Now sober again and back on sub, 

I recently learned how bad it was that i was on sub for so long, now I'm tapering down very slowly, I'm a complete bitch when it comes to WDs so I'm tapering with extreme caution.

To give an idea i was on 4-6 mgs for 3+ years, sometimes going down to 2-4mg but mainly i would lower my dose for a week so i would get a small buzz from it, for lack of better words i was sober but not sober. Yea i wasn't doing dope anymore but still trying to abuse subs, wasn't fully committed to being and staying sober.

After this recent relapse i told myself enough is enough and truly want to be clean from it all, this time I'm doing it for myself, not for family or friends (never works). So now I'm starting my extremly slow taper to get off sub and live the sober life, the ""security blanket"" never worked because i had no will power. If i had the chance to get high id take it. 

For me i need to strengthen my will power, i still have my dealers #s, its to show that i can get high whenever i want to. And that i can't run away from my addiction, i need to face it straight on. Its the only way i can beat this i think. I started making a lot of changes in my life since that last relapse, re evaluating what my triggers/cravings are or come from, what makes me depressed and what triggers my anxiety attacks. I'm trying to become the master of my emotions and self, finding who i am and working on becoming the person ive always wanted to be. I know its going to be very hard. But I'm tired of letting addiction control my life in one way or another. I want to be free.

If you took the time to read this i just want to say thankyou for reading, i really needed somewhere to vent.

And if you are in a long term sub use program i highly recommend tapering off it. It did nothing good for me, but if it works for you then keep doing what works, but it never worked for me and other people. 

Anyways you guys are amazing and i hope you all have a wonderful rest of the day! 

Ill update when I'm fully off the subs, wish me luck! 

Take care everyone!

I don't have a whole lot of experience with them, but I have done them a handful of times.

I have an opportunity to get a few 100mcg patches tomorrow.  My question is, how much do they generally go for nowadays?  

If anyone could chime in with how much they pay for 100mcg fent patches where they're at, I would appreciate it!

I left home with about $1,000 and no real plan. Because of staying at a $60 motel every night and using daily ($50 or more daily) I've already run out of all my money besides $20 now. I'd love to live in either California or Colorado as I've worked for a grow op before and love weed and working with it. Ive been in treatment multiple times this year at the same place in the midwest and am thinking about possibly trying to continue treatment out west. I just do not know how to even execute what I'd love to do due to my financial situation and living situation (homeless). What I'm wondering is what you guys would do in my situation. Should I stay out in the Midwest? Or just sell basically everything I own to try to make some more money and just head out west. I just really need some help / direction. I'm very sorry if this is the wrong place to talk about this.

TLDR;
I'm homeless in the Midwest with $20 to my name wondering how I can start a fresh life over again or west in Colorado or California",1515965792.0

The fact is, guys, is that I'm bored. You know who brought sexy back? Yeah, that was me, and it's not as great as you'd think. In fact, it can be a fucking nightmare.. It's winter now, and even as a straight male, I'm so fucking attractive that wherever I go I can use all of erections I'm surrounded by as a coat rack. Fuck, man. Its hard for me to go out in public anymore and the last time I did I ended up in the ER...after I slipped on a pair of wet panties.....Just fuckin' dropped panties and erections everywhere guys. Just let that soak in for a minute.   
  
I just can't fucking take it anymore. My life sucks...I fucking hate this shit. ""But Capn? What about all the dropped panties and erections? You could be the next president of the United States!"" I know what you're thinking, and you're right. There's absolutely nothing normal about it....And I don't want to be fucking president. I wanted the boredom filled nightmare to end for fuck sake. I needed some real excitement.  I needed to be able to feel again.

You ever wonder what it would be like to be the most interesting man in the world? Well, there it is. There becomes a point in your life where nothing else gets your jollys off, and that's where heroin comes in and saves you. Like a nice refreshing cup of coffee.   
  
Because skydiving, racecar driving, wet panties and dodging all the erections just isn't enough for me anymore. I needed to tap into something better, something more pure. The essence of life.

**MOLLY SIDE NOTE -** (His current batch is probably cut with speed/meth. I have ADHD and it feels like Adderall x10 to me. The tan batch I copped once was good tho. I still copped some of this batch tho. Only so I can bang it though.

Anyways, got off track. I got in the shower to bang some yayo because yayo + a hot shower = a moderate skin orgasm.

I fucking missed. To be fair, I haven't banged anything in months. I kinda felt it, but no ear ringing or anything too interesting.

I tried again while on the couch playing the new Dragon Ball FighterZ Open Beta. As I went to prep the shot, I noticed It got wet in the shower....so I used the plunger from the rig to dig the gooey shit out the bag and put it in syringe cap (my cooker). 

I have no clue how much I put in there to be honest. Probably a quarter to half a gram.

I hit the first time, but I just sensed an abcess coming . 

The second attempt was a success.

**SIDE NOTE #2** I want to save the veins in the crook of my arms for dope, but it's so hard to resist. The crook never fails.

I drew back, saw red (fuck yes), and pushed slooowly.

Oh my fuck. THAT SHIT WAS DEMONIC.

Don't get me fucked up. It felt good as fuck. It's just that I legitimately thought that I was going to die.

 I went 78% deaf, got a massive bell ringer, and the things that I *could* hear were very high pitched. It was like sound waves were made of helium.

For at least a full minute, The thought that I should call the amber lamps was running though my head. But then I was like: nah, I'm cool.

I popped a bar about 20 min and now I'm here typing this

Lets talk about the DJ,"the dj is the desperate junkie.  That guy that will pull the most obsurd and shitty stunts to get their fix with no regard for anyone else

 My recent Dj story took place this weekend.  3 of us that use together that know the same common dboy were going to make one run so we could all get our shit. But the dj was insisting we go to his exclusive dboy that only he knew(red flag). After much arguing and drama we finally set in stone we are going to the common dboy
 
 The guy driving decided not to take the dj along for the ride as he is a whiney bitch so the two of us set out with the plan that I would hop dboys car. Cover every ones shit with my money and then collect from everyone and give them their shit
  
Before I bought anything i asked the dj 7 times if he had the money to cover his portion which he defiantly said yes and got mad that I even asked(you see where this is going)  and at this times he asked me to hold all the shit till we got back and give it all to him first so he could pick his bag before anyone else(red flag) fuck that not happening dude

So i get everything. Give the driver his shit and collect the money. No problem.
Get to the dj s house and walk in he immediately greets me at the door and demands his shit ""where's it at give it to me""(red flag)  so following a rule similar to never let your money walk I refused to give him the bag till he gave me the money. He responds ""I got it wtf just give it to me I need a shot I'm sick as fuck""(red flag)  I tell him give me the money or I'm leaving

He grumbles and heads to his bedroom saying ""why are you doing this to me""  comes back empty handed and claims he will have money in two days and to just give him the bag and he'll pay me later.  Fuck that. You lied to me dude I'm outta here.  This kid literally threw himself in front of the door refusing to let me leave. Literally crying and begging me to give it to him.  Tried to wrestle it from me.  Cried some more and a Planted himself in front of the door

Me being a nice guy and generally a sap. I said ill give you a shot so your not sick but them I'm leaving. His response ""no! I need the whole fucking bag I have to go to school Monday I need it""  no dude ill give you a shot that's it
 "" then your giving me the empty bag so I can get the wash from the residue stuck to the baggie""
Are you fucking kidding me?

So I put out a tiny shot and said here dude do this get right and we'll talk about and when he scampered off to get his rig I walked out the door and left. He spent the next 2 hours blowing up my phone begging.threatening and demanding the rest of the bag.  Said he was gonna come to my house and get it I had to threaten him with the police if he showed up there.

Tldr:kid asked me to pick his bag for him. Didn't have money. Tried forcing a front on an empty promise of money later

My name is Jake From The West Coast (No it's not...who are we kidding..but that's what I'm calling myself. Everything else in this post is 100% true) and I've been a long time follower of this site. So many threads have saved me over and over I cant thank this site enough. I've followed it pretty much for 6+ years. I have some quick solutions to detox. Im sure people have posted similar stuff 90000 times here but I felt like sharing my story and im here for any questions. The first two detox I ever went through were without anything and I couldn't imagine doing that ever again. Here's what I do to get off and sometimes stay off **Note. I do have lifetime uncurable nasal condition that causes real, terrible hourly pain**


I'll just say now I dont have the best grammar or spelling. I'm here for telling...not spelling! So if you're a grammar Nazi...you can still read my plan but hold your little snide remarks to your little grammar group. I can just see you guys holding weekly meetings correcting peoples grammar and spelling on twitter and Instagram. 


How long have I used pain meds and a little of my backstory. Scroll down past if you're in serious hurting and don't give a flying fuck about my little story and just need detox tips.
Since 2003 when I had my first sinus surgery. 5mg Norco was the first thing I ever had...It changed my life for the good and bad. I have chronic nasal polyps that causes weekly sinus infections, 20+ operations, no sense of of smell 80-90% less tasting than normal..and constant pressure and pain in my face. I was given 5-10 mg of hydrocodone pretty regularly for the first 5 years as there is no cure for my ailment. its not life threatening but it is considered top 5 worst diseases to live with. Just imagine 50 pound weight on ur head. You have i thin 8 sinus cavities...when you're stuffed up and full blown ""SICK"" you have 1-2 cavaites filled. All 8 of my sinuses caves have been filled since 1996...when I was 10. I'm 32 now. Just this list doctor visit when we agreed on my 21st sinus surgery he finally got me a pain management apportionment. IM praying that I can keep this and dont screw it up. I really want to be normal and have done so for months and years but it's time to do it for good. I didnt get hooked until about 4-5 years ago. I remember the day my friend told me she knew a guy that sold norcos daily. $4 for yellow norcos. Get as many as you want whenever you want (he's now a friend of mine and finally told me how. His friend worked for a drug pharmacy courier and took daily orders. That stopped about 2 years ago when the govt tightened their noose around opiates)

That first purchase of 15 of them changed my life no matter how you look at it. I got up to 30-40 of them at my worst. Im now on day 2 of my 15th-20th detox (i've lost count)...my most recent habit was about 2-3 of them every 3 - 5 hours. roughly anywhere from 12-25 a day. Here's my daily detox guide. Note im no freaking doctor...far from it. Just a functioning addict who lives in daily pain and would like to share with you how I function without pain meds all the time. Also...there is other medication in my list...if you cant get it prescribed or 'Find it' i'll have other options for you..which obviously wont be as good. I have seen the Thomas guide but i knew after reading that fucking bible length guide and my ADHD lazy ass was never sticking to or doing that guide. SO here's the...



LAZY POS FAKE JAKE PAIN PILL DETOX PLAN

My Detox with Prescribed Medication: *Note. I'm currently on disability. I have worked during a detox though and it sucks. You can do it though. But..if there's anyway to get time off please ask for the work week off 5 days. If you cant get that many...try to get a Thursday and friday off so you can plan this. I can't explain to you how much easier it is for me when I can stay in bed and around the house by myself and my GF. I'm also very opiate tolerant. I'll binge for 3-6 months at 10 10mg norcos- 30 10mg norcos a day. Please consider that when doing this. If you have a 2-3 pill a day habit. Take everything I say and cut it in half. If not more. Do research. Have a gameplan.

Medication and amount needed for a 7 day detox. 
(7-12) 10MG Ambien
(3-4) 8MG Suboxone or Subutex
(15-20) .5mg of Ativan or (or (10) 1mg Xanax) 


Details of medication below

(10) 10mg of Ambien (*OTC Ambien substitute. Melatonin 5mg Or a weed edible if you smoke. Ambien can be used like a benzo since it works like one and sometimes i can't tell the difference from ambien and ativan. Albeit i've used ambien on and off for a year. Not reccomended for everyone. Im one of the very few that dont get blacked out off ambien do weird shit besides the time I blacked out and shaved both my eyebrows 3 days before my friends wedding who miraculously called off the wedding...i got lucky ( he did too) )(4) 8mg Subxone broken in 4 2mg quarters (Suboxone substitute if you cant get your hands on it this is emergency only 40mg-60mg of Imodium daily I'll detail this later and dont take it without reading my full story on it). 

(20) .5mg Ativan (Any narcotic anti-anxitey will work. Valium. Klonopin. Ativan. Xanax. Look up the other benzos...the only benzos ive had is Ativan and Xanax.
2mg of Ativan = 1mg of Xanax. I dont know of a OTC substitute that will even remotely come close to these for the mental aspect. IF you wanna get sleepy get benedrayl)

*** If you cant get any of these...the only other medication i've used in a pinch that worked was Soma's. 500mg. 2-3 times a day for 7 days. Also, Kratom Bali strain helped too but it made me through up sometimes so I dont use it. But Kratom has it's great amount of success stories. I would look into that if I were you. It just wasnt my thing *** 

IF you cant get ANYTHING...Scroll to the bottom and read my list of shit i used my 2nd detox when I was a newbie and it helped 50%


I love you. You can fucking do this. I'm not just saying that. IM the laziest...least strong willed person on this planet and im able to stop for long stretches. So can you. Im here for you if you have no one. I'll respond to you all. YOU HAVE TO MENTALLY and Physically prepapre yourself for each detox. It's almost like war. Seriously

**Note 2-5 minimum of 30 min hot showers daily. 4-6 32 oz Gatorades daily.
Day 1: (12 hours after my last dose) This has been a routine. I count my pills...I do my last 2-3 around 2-4am. I wake up around noon...kick the can for a few hours until hour 12 when I take 2mg of suboxone. I know there has been hell of research and posts about when you can take subs. I see some people saying 24-48 hours and i honestly cant believe it. Im sure everyone is a bit differnt and other drugs probably effect the time difference but 12 hours is way enough time at least for me. ( i've taken subs 5 hours after my last dose once on accident...i felt normal and fine) I usually try to stay occupied by watching stuff online, reading sports, playing with my GF cats (they have saved me a lot of sad times), and kind of clock watch. My Gf gets home around 6-7pm we hangout and eat and watch TV. She knows about all of this FYI...she is highly supportive and just wants to see my happy and healthy. MY Anxiety doesn't really kick in until the 24 hour mark of the last pain pill you took. This is when I take anywhere from .5mg of ativan -2mg of Ativan. I get prescribed Ativan recently and its just mainly to help sleep (insomnia) and to kick this shit to be honest. Hour 28 roughly 4am Im ready for bed (night owl) and I take 10-20mg of Ambien. 10mg if im already slightly sleepy. Ambien is a godsend. If I could only pick one drug to get through this it would probably be Ativan but Ambien is a close second. It takes all my worries and restlessness away and I usually sleep well on it. 



Day 2ish: 2pm 36 hours from last dose: 4mg of Suboxone. 4-6 Imodium if stomach is hurting (Imodium is so clutch) 30 minute warm shower ( take a shit ton of showers in the first week. i take 3-5 a day when im detoxing. It helps the muscles and makes you feel better and passes the time) 6pm anxiety is really kicking 2mg of ativan...15 minutes later Im thinking about ice cream and petting my cats..gf shows up from work in a good mood and makes me feel better. 30 min shower (everyday)

Hour 48: 2am 1-2 mg suboxone. 1mg ativan. Yea..you're thinking of contacting your dealer because this fucking sucks. Oh well..cave if you want. You HAVE to be 100 committed to this. Lets go. 30 min shower detox boy!

Hour 51: 5am 10mg of ambien...Zzzzzzzzz 




Day 3ish: 3pm: The more sleep you can get the better. I cant tell you how much it helps. Also my diet this whole time is a shit load of water and Gatorade. Breads...Sandwiches...and whatever my GF will kindly make. And taking a ton of shits 30 min shower after worst shits.

Hour 63: 5pm 4mg Sub. 2mg ativan. This is usually the worst freaking day so be prepared to have Ativan. 30 minute warm shower (5 showers this day) Sandwich. 3 cups of gatorade. 4mg Imodium. 3 hour nap. shower 30min

Hour 69: 11pm HEY-0!!! 30min shower, 1mg Ativan Im feeling normal and happy. Writing about sports..shooting the shit with friends on text. Looking up funny videos with my GF. playing with the cats. (ANYTHING YOU CAN DO TO KEEP YOUR MIND OCCUPIED AND 30 min shower

Hour 74: 4am 20mg Ambien.... zzzzZZzzzz (sometimes if you wake up and are freaking out. Either take a tiny piece .5mg-1mg of sub or take 1mg ativan and go back to sleep)




Day 4ish: Hey, you made it longer than Kurt Kobain, Kid (RIP).
Hour 86: 4pm Yea I wake up late sometimes...sue me. 1.5mg of Sub (time to start tapering if you can) 32 oz gator 30 min shower

Hour 90: 8pm 2mg ativan. eat (Forced) . shower. jack off (seriously..it helps me). 

Hour 92: 10pm Long walk with my GF. Any motion helps and helps your body fight the poison. 32oz gatorade

Hour 94: Midnight 1mg Sub. 1mg ativan. Snack. 30 min shower

Hour 97: 3am 10mg ambien. 32 oz gatorade 30 min shower

Day 5ish: Hour 108 2pm: .5mg sub. .5mg ativan. lunch. 32oz water/gatorade 30min shower

Hour 112: Where the players dwell!!! 6pm Dinner with gf. First day i leave the house...head to a decent pizza place. Finally things feel back to normal-ish.

Hour 116: 10pm .5mg ativan .5mg sub. snack. 32 gatorade. 30min shower

Hour 120: 2am 20 mg ambien (not sleepy at all. if so I take 2) Usually takes me anywere from 30 mins -2 hours to fall asleep FYI




Day 6ish: Hour 130: Noon One more day player...one more day. Are you proud of me for waking up before 2pm? My cats are. 30min shower. 32 gatorade

Hour 136: 6pm .25 Sub ( really try to taper. Im sure you can do a better job than me. ) 32 gatorade

Hour 140 : 10 pm .5mg ativan. Dinner. Walk with GF. 30 min shower. 32 gatorade

Hour 142: Midnight .5mg ativan (u can feel ur bones hurt a bit when stopping subs) Icy hot my back and legs.

Hour 143: 3am 10mg Ambien 32 gatorade




Day FUCKING 7: Hour 155 3pm: I slept in cuz I fucking deserved it alright! Do the Cha Cha. Fuck your Girl (or guy) FUck youR Furry. Fuck the mailman. Fuck yourself! Fuck anyone but your dealer but that impossible because you deleted his number ...right ? RIGHT!?!??! Seriously This day and the next 23 are the easiest to forget the mini hell that you just went through and hop back on the opiate train. Please dont. Im a hypocrite tho...I also have daily pain that sucks...not saying im better than you though. We are all the same. You 100% cannot stop until you're ready...have a gameplan..stick to it. Be happy. If that requires a therapist then do it. Its not gonna be all cherry and puppies. You short circuted your brain into months or years of happiness and fun and euphoria...it's gonna balance itself out. I dont think subs are amazing for long term as I do see them as another opiate (opiod) but thats me. If you cant kick h or smoking hella blues...by all means PLEASE go on a year or however long Suboxone maintenance. Please search your areas for a sub doctor. Not any doctor can prescribe Suboxone. oh yea..30 min shower and 32 oz gatorade motherfuckers.

Hour 160: 8pm .25sub (last sub) 30 min shower. 2mg Ativan. Dinner GF decided to treat me to a home cooked meal. Do shit like this to reward yourself and dont beat yourself up. Shit happens to the best of us. The smartest people in the world. The prettiest. The most athletic. Doctors. It's ok...life fucking sucks sometimes. Just pick yourself back up and play with cats. Seriously get a damn cat please. 

Hour 164: Midnight 1mg ativan 32 oz gatorarde 30 min shower. Icy hot all over my damn body. 

Hour 167: I love you all...you've done it . 20mg ambien sleep well, young thugs. It's been real.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now. If you're not able to get any of these or just a mix of these. Whatever you can get it....have a game plan. Say you only can get 4 xanax and 1 sub. Spread those over 5 days. U have to. You can do it. I honestly could do a detox now with 7 ambien 1 sub and a few ativan. But I like to do it comfortable . Sleep is key. Game planning is MAJOR KEY ALERT. Having a safe and warm not choatic house to detox at. Access to bathroom shower/tub kitchen. you're own bed. Im very thankful to have all of that. Please prepare for this. Ask for help. iF you have no friends or family walk into the ER room until they force somewhere to take you. You're gonna get through this . Try not to clock watch. Try not to think about using. Its impossible but at least fight it. You're at war here. Fuck those things. FUck your pos dealer that upcharges through the roof and scoffs at helping you when you're hurting. Fuck the dealer who dont front. FUCK THESE THINGS FOR HELPING AND HURTING ME! I love cats.

Now if you cant get ANYYYYY of these medications. Here is what I did...at your caution.

I've in one sitting taken 30 2mg immodium pills. ANd it helped. I did a ton of research on it. I was desperate. And dare I say it pretty much made me feel normal. Obviously dont do this for more than 4-5 days in a row but Imodium IS a OPIOTE...just a OTC. Just like meth heads did with sudafed ...some guy who coudnt get a hold of his perk30 dealer started popping Imodium until he felt something. It's a dirty high though...so dont do it recerationaly. Seriously. You can skip your heart...cause vision issues. Any longer abuse of it. But in short term Yes 20-60mg is safe. People say it doesnt cross the blood brain barrier to become a true opiate which is kinda true..l just know when i took 20+ of them detoxing i felt like i was on a small dose of norcos. It does block up ur shitting for 48 hours so dont do this long term. 




LAZY POS FAKE JAKE PAIN PILL DETOX PLAN WITHOUT PRESCRIBED MEDS


Day 1-5 (THIS IS FOR THE OPIATE EXPERIENCED ONLY) 20-40mg of imodium daily (skip day 4..dont ever take these things longer than 3 days at time. DO research. This what worked for me ) 10mg of melatonin at night for sleep. Bendaryl for anxiety. ICY HOT Yes this whole plan sucks but it's 50% better than nothing I promise. 

I'll be checking back for anyone that needs help or questions. I might not have been exactly precise but this is almost to the T of what I do every time. (i'm on day 2)


Love you all. Please be safe. Please have a gameplan. Having a gameplan is 80% of the battle.


Peace and Love

When I used to chip, I would sleep off any WD symptoms, but I've been about a half gram or so a day user for the last year or so, so Im guessing this is going to be different. Anyway, I quit drinking (5 years sober from booze... wooo), so I can do this.

Her husband deals and usually he will break her out a line of coke and h and she will do it right away but lately she's had a mirror around with lines laid out on it. She's never had more drugs than she can consume right away so this is very unusual. She's usually yelling at him to get the drugs faster. She calls it her medicine. I've seen her slowly and carefully lie down on the ground and yell for him repeatedly and tell him she either fell down and couldn't get up and thinks she's having a heart attack or that she just came to on the ground and didn't know how she got there. It's happened multiple times. She's also told him in all seriousness that she was going to have a heart attack if she wasn't given more cocaine asap. This is just the tip of the insanity iceberg. 

So not long ago me and the gf go upstairs to buy some dope and she starts talking to us. She tells us that much like Jesus turning water into wine she that she has been turning tums into heroin mixed with cocaine and getting high on it. She then shambled off to the bedroom and returns with a mirror with a line broken out on it and offers it to us. She told us it started off as a tums but now it's dope but that we can't shoot it because of its texture but that she's working on that issue. The roommate says she breaks up the lines and then thinks really hard about dope and it becomes dope. Says its probably because she was a ""CIA kid"". Lol. I took a tiny pinch of the line and tasted it and said yup it's dope. She looked like ""yea duh"". It really was tums. She said she discovered this ability in jail when after she imagined doing a bunch of coke and the imaginary coke getting her high that the doctors came and told her that she had a lethal amount of cocaine in her system lol. 

So fucking nuts. Wish I could recall more details. 

She also told us a few days ago that she was part of ""the 1% of the population that couldn't gets aids"" and that if we knew anyone with aids to let them know they could shoot up her blood for a few days and they'd be cured. 

She truthfully believes all this. She's so batshit crazy that before I went to jail I was going to write her life story for the laughs. Told her it was for writing class smh. Still may do it. She says her dad was ""head of the military"" and her mom was an admiral but they died in a freak top secret submarine accident that gave her bone cancer her whole life. Also the secret submarine is still under Paris to this day.

Me and my friends had this, wooden square made for mountain bikes, but we sat on it and smoked weed all day cause it was a great spot. One day my friend J comes up to the square and says he found this vile on the road. I look at it and its this white power, i think its crack or something. Anyways we dont want anything to do with it so we're fucking around with it, and i jokingly decide to burn the vile with a lighter right under the white powder. Obviously it melted into a liquid and started smoking, now im not a user and never will be, but i know some of you are cringing right now that i just burnt like $300 worth of heroin just to see it smoke. At the time i had no idea what it was of course, but something was really elegant and subtle about the smoke and how it liquefied, and my friend J says to me ""Haha you should take a hit of the smoke"" And obviously i wouldnt do that but in that very moment i was soooo compelled just to huff it right there and see what it did. Thank god i didnt, because after we disposed of the now burnt vile with gunk in it, J's ""mother"" walked up to the square which is weird because a lot of people dont know where it is. She asked J to come talk to her, next thing you know they're shouting. i dont pay attention but i do hear ""WHERE IS IT J?!"" And ""ARE YOU TRYING TO GET ME KILLED LIKE LAST TIME?!"" Well now i know whats up, J stole it from his mother cause shes a fuckin junky bitch and wanted to teach her a lesson. At this point im just thankful i didnt take a whiff of the stuff, cause when he came back to the square he was so mad and told us how he stole a bunch of drugs from her and basically threw them all out except that vile, which he told us was like $300 of china white. And he says to me ""good thing you didnt smoke that, that little bit would have killed you right there"" I didnt even speak. I was flabbergast, i wasnt mad because i know he was joking when he said to take a hit and if i actually had said i was going too he woulda said no dont. But i could have easily took a lethal hit of heroin and there woulda been no time for them to react. I think about it sometimes and it just furthers my opinion on heroin and some opiates

TL;DR Friend stole $300 of china white off his ""mother""

We fuck with it and i burn the vile causing the hereion to liquify and smoke out the top

im really tempted to take a whiff

dont

friend tells me its china white and that woulda killed me if i whiffed it

We weren't as close as some of the others I've lost, but but we said Hi and chatted for a few when we bumped into each other, and I always felt fondly towards him.  He was 26.

The first friend I lost to fentanyl was the worst.  That was back in May of 2016, when it was just getting started here.  He was my best friend, and I think about him every day.  He was my ""hard drug guru"", even though he was like ten years younger than me, he turned me on to Ecstasy and Ketamine, taught me how to snort, and middled all my deals, no charge.  I met him about ten years ago, when I was hanging with a real rough crowd that did a lot of drugs, and I did a lot of drugs with them.  After a couple bad trips, I decided I didn't enjoy psychedelics anymore and stopped using them.  The Ecstasy took their place, but I was doing 8-balls of it to myself in like 48-72 hour sessions and the crash afterward inevitably left me daydreaming about suicide, so eventually I quit doing that.  I never quit ketamine, but something happened to the availability so that the price went up so much I couldn't afford it anymore.

Now over this time, I started to drift apart from the group.  I wasn't getting high everyday anymore, and they weren't as much fun to hang out with when I was sober and they were all fucked up.  I did still use sometimes, sometimes alone and sometimes with some or all of the group, and things were generally good.  One of the group members had a psychotic break, thought I was his archenemy and tried to fight me one night (200lb. sober guy being feebly attacked by 80lb. schizophrenic on a multi-day speed bender, let's just say I won without difficulty and without fucking him up more than I needed to so stop him).  Hardly traumatic, but that was the moment the group started to fall apart.  We always hung out at his place and this was no longer an option, so we hung out at different places, less and less.  80lb. psycho ended up moving to a different city, dunno what happened to him but I bet he's dead.

A couple years went by.  I rediscovered RC's and am still enjoying the exploration, but I am careful.  I do my homework, and I try not to skip any steps, but I still fucked up once and burned my apartment to bare black walls when I was on K one time, and very nearly died.  It can happen to anyone.  That experience deeply affected my friend who sold me the K, to the point where he quit dealing entirely, and was a bonding time for the both of us.  He's the one I put in the ground in May 2016.  I didn't feel anything about it at the time, just this awful toxic numbness.  Then more people started dying...friends, acquaintances, people I knew to see but didn't talk to much, all dropping like flies.  I wore out my black funeral shirt and had to go buy another one.  It was happening so fast and so often that the numbness just got deeper and more toxic.  I have terrible maladaptive coping mechanisms...I bottle for a long time, and when I can't do that anymore, drug bender to try and break down some of the walls I build to protect myself, so I can feel some of the feelings I am bottling and not dealing with.  But this is different, by the time I feel like I am ready to start that process, somebody else dies and it's like someone pulled the rug out from underneath me and I'm back where I started.  Everyone from that group I used to use with it either dead or moved now, mostly dead.

After today, after hearing about Johnny, I realize my bottle is so big now, trying to contain all that grief from that first death and stuff it down underneath the grief from the other deaths.  I can't take it anymore.  If I lose anyone else, that bottle's gonna burst, whether I like it or not, and it might just burst anyways, and I don't know how that's going to leave me.  I have no friends to talk to.  I can't trust professionals...even if I desperately want help, I'm too scared of their power to really tell them how I am feeling (except for one time, I did tell them honestly how I felt...they made me do a written test then told me my test results meant I was faking it all, and I've never been able to not lie to a professional since the one time I managed to do so ended up in being told to my face that I was lying).  I'd talk to my friends, but they're either dead or gone.  I don't know what I am going to do, but whatever it is, it scares me.",1516083250.0

My pain has become substantially worse and to top it off due to my last experiences with the emergency room i have not visited any doctors.

I will be visiting my doctor's assistant on friday , as my doctor does not have any appointments in the morning.


Im in the worst pain i have ever been in, in my entire life .


I know that Tramadol does not act on the same pathways and does work with suboxone (I have tried it myself)

I know that Tapentadol also uses similar pathways

(Tramadol can be used concurrently with suboxone)

But what else?

Is that it? lol


I have a feeling that they will most likely switch me to abuse-proof hydromorphone after i see 100 different doctors.


I have TMJ but its turning into a neuralgia in which i have pain throughout my head accompanied by vertigo/lightheadness, 
i have severe , crippling pain in my ear and often times my neck and other parts of my head are also bothering me.
The Jaw, and the ear, being the worst. But i also have radiating pain when i close my mouth.  i also have radiating pain through my shoulders.



tl;dr: What pain combination did you find best while you were in suboxone?
What pain combination did you find best AFTER YOU GOT OFF suboxone?




PS: ive been on Suboxone for 13 years. 9 years straight. im @ 4mg. i recently increased from 2mg due to the pain. Suboxone does not really treat my pain but its all i have besides codeine & dihydrocodeine .




So i hope that you understand my question as it is a bit hard to ask/explain in the proper wording
(i want to know what is the best opioids that can be used while on suboxone, and the best that you have found at relieving pain, after quitting suboxone. what opioid did you go to when you quit suboxone, to find adequate pain relief?)


Thanks for reading, 
and please no answers like ""ur guna relapse derka derka""
no, if i wanted to relapse i could have done that 10,000x
at this point of trying every pain medication and psychiatric medication on the market including 4 different muscle relaxers and 3 different NSAIDs that are burning ulcers in my stomach i could give a fuck less what people think about opiate and i hope that they legalize them.


It pisses me off that i am going to have to prostrate myself infront of doctors . im probably going to have to do it 20 times too",1516077912.0

I used Kratom as an alternative to other opiates. It seemed like a safe alternative, and a way I could stay 'in the shallow end.'


Well, I am addict, and it didn't work. I upped and upped my dosage until I was sick all the time - either from using too much, or not enough. My life became a nightmare. The withdrawal was 10x worse than it was from other opiate. The RLS was in-fucking-sane. I needed something else... I had come this far, and K was expensive, so getting back on the wagon seemed like the obvious choice.


I see people recommending kratom on this sub frequently, and it breaks my heart when I think of someone going through what I went through. Equally, I can totally understand that if it had 'worked' for me, I would want to spread the message. So, no hate to the people trying to spread the love.

Thanks! ☺️

See, the deal is...I took my methadone an hour before seeing him.  He doesn't know I'm a recovering h addict on maintenance methadone. 

apparently I live in the most dangerous and drug filled neighborhood in my city (when I heard this my jaw dropped because it's PRETTY DAMN NICE, last five years I lived in a shit hole midwestern city) he said they sell ""white heroin"" that all the girls on it are lesbian whores and that he thinks I let some dealer give me something. That when he saw me I looked FUCKED UP. 

I'm only on 40 mg of methadone and lemme tell ya folks shit will get you BLASTED. I was on like a gram and a half of h a day IV and 40 mg done makes me nod out. So I didn't wanna tell him this. I instead admit I'm bi polar, send him an article about my abilify and the extreme fatigue that's a side effect (all true) and promise him not to worry. 

On his birthday last week he paid for dinner paid for me to go to the club with him VIP. Paid for 2 bags of Coke for me paid for everything even my 1 euro metro ticket I was humiliated that I couldn't afford and it was HIS birthday. He constantly tell me to stop playing with the cocaine that me quitting would make him way happier and he wouldn't care about any financial losses. He's just...so sweet. 😭Maybe it's because we both have Muslim origins. It kinda creates a kinship. (I'm agnostic I just mean culture wise) 

I would never go back to that shit. I'm curious though white h wtf? Is that fent I thought we didn't have fent here in Spain. I also am kinda miffed he suggested would even THINK about selling myself and becoming one of these ""lesbian prostitutes"" (come on they can't all be lesbians what is he talking about lol)

whatever I sure hope he believed me 

long story short: my friend (dealer but friend first and foremost) thought I was on ""white heroin"" because I took my methadone an hour before seeing him and he was worried I was whoring myself out for heroin. I told him I was on my bi polar mess abilify (which I do take) ",1516071181.0

Let me go ahead and admit I had a lot of help.. I have been in jail the last 4 months. 
I was so committed to the drug that I let every single thing crumble around me. I constantly fucked people over that did nothing but love me. I lied and stole like my life depended on it. When all was said and done and I got arrested I was homeless and hitch hiking because the cops were showing up at my girlfriend and I's apt daily looking for me. 
I started with lortabs and worked my way up the pharmaceutical ladder at the age of 18 ending with shooting 10 8mg Dilaudids a day if I had the funds and worked my way over to heroin. The last year I was using I sunk so far into isolating myself that I gave up heroin and switched to opium tea. Using sometimes 3 pounds a day of seeds from the big 3. I did this because I didn't want to associate with people anymore. I could buy online and drown out the world. I had a beautiful girlfriend that was working 2 jobs and going to school. I idolized her and she was all the interaction I needed. But I too destroyed that with my self destructive behavior. 

I'm now 23 years old. I spent my 23rd birthday in jail. I went 4 months alone. No phone calls. No visits. No contact with the outside world. The first week I laid in my rack staring at the holes in the bottom of the bunk above me thinking of how I could loop my sheet through to asphyxiate myself without waking the guy above me up. I don't know what kept me from following through honestly. I was so broken. I spent the first full month in withdrawal due to tea's long half life. It took a month and a half to feel 90% again. I went three weeks without more than 45 minutes of sleep every other day. I am grateful for it all. I had to experience that. It broke me down to the base of my being and allowed me to rebuild myself. I cant begin to explain how much of a lost cause I was. I would have surely have died before I quit if I wasn't forced into that position. 

And now every day is a little bit better. I feel things again. I'm getting goose bumps as I type this because I can FEEL things again. I can smile because I want to now and not because I think thats what I should do for you. I can listen to what you have to say and actually care and be engaged. I feel happiness and joy and love and sadness and nervousness. All these I couldn't feel before because I went 5 straight years without detoxing back to homeostasis once. I'm free to let my mind explore this playground we call life and consciousness without the chains that opiates held me down with. I have been out a week tomorrow and have not considered once using.
I got out of jail a week ago and my girlfriend was there. I walked out of jail expecting to go walk to find a place to be homeless and she was right there waiting and my god people I cant explain how beautiful of a feeling it was wrapping my arms around her again.

I'm sharing this for those of you that feel hopeless. For those that take a shot hoping every time you might just not wake up. For those who have lost everything and still cant give it up. I felt the same exact way and I am here today to tell you that things CAN change. You can feel again and break the chains. I hope whatever force it takes to heal you finds you and your life becomes something you want to live again.

Much love. ",1516069133.0

**UPDATED WITH PIC! WTF IS THIS??**
It's supposed to be Oxy... and I've never done heroin- oxy is my DOC. Worried it's heroin/fent. There is weed mixed in with it cuz of a dirty surface.  Never seen oxy this color and am pretty certain it's not oxy. 

WARNING (this is long & annoying cuz I was in a hurry/ I'm sorry);

So I went on a dumb goose chase this afternoon with my old connect who isn't the brightest crayon in the box. He was just hooking me up with a few percs, then asked me to give him a ride to meet someone else for him to grab some xanax- he also mentioned the guy had an oxy 80 he was gonna buy and offered to split it w/me for giving him the extra ride. He called them purple and I know my oxy... never heard of a purple 80mg oxy. He said he rubs the coating off before he crushes them, so I imagined it was an OxyContin, not oxy IR. I tried to convince him to just cut it in half but he was insistent about crushing the whole pill and splitting it in half that way. And wanted me to do a line with him. I'm like, I guess- just thought he was lonely and I wanted oxy, so I agreed to it.... I never saw the pill cuz he put the drugs like down his pants- when we got to his house, he jumped out of the car to go get the lines ready while I parked- when I come in and see the lines,  it was like this off white color (almost yellow).. and I did just a tiny bit and scraped the rest into a pill container to bring with me- my heart started beating fast for like a minute & felt light-headed (never happens with oxy for me) and it smelled weird- but the drip in my throat tasted like oxy and it pretty much felt like it after the intense first minute or so,  
Do you think it's heroin? Never tried it before so I don't know.  And do you think he was trying to pretend that it was oxy, knowing it was heroin, just to get $40 off me? I was asking him about the imprint and he said it just said 80 on it and maybe something on the other side, but he has bad eyesight (he really does). Then he said it could have maybe been turquoise but he gets them from the guy when he can afford them. How the hell can you mistake purple for turquoise??

**Entry 34** - Friday, 11:00 PM
We almost made it to the exit into the courtyard when Ben’s weight caused the supports above the ceiling to break. We fell through in front of the courtyard door. When we looked out the door’s window we saw that it was not our building on fire, but the building we were headed to. 

The entire dining hall, kitchen, and office building was engulfed in flames. The fire was roaring, reaching over 20 ft high. The flames were too close and the heat too much to bear even one step into the courtyard. Chloe burned her hand pretty badly on the metal knob just trying to open the door. We really had no option but to turn back into the hallway and face the hoard of crazed junkies heading towards us. We could see them beginning to round the corner.

We just stood there, paralyzed. Burn to death or get eaten alive? That was the question.

Ben looked at me and told me to take care of Spooner. He told us we had to make a sprint for the intake office about halfway down the hallway. The horde had a head start and the fastest of them were already fairly close to the office. I knew there was no way we would make it in time. But when Ben began to sprint down the hallway, we followed. 

Ben and the hoard made it to the door at the same moment. But instead making a turn into the office, Ben powered forward at the oncoming mass of bodies. I watched in horror as he collided with the head of the hoard in an explosion of blood, flesh, and breaking bones. I felt the floor shake beneath me.

Chole made it into the office and I was able to help Spooner shuffle through. I put him on the couch and headed back into the hallway. But by then it was well too late. Ben had been able to push the oncoming mass of 30-40 bodies back by at least 15 feet, allowing us the time to enter the office. I stood there for a moment in the doorway. 

I don’t know what these things are but I do know that they are no longer human. They were ferocious in their focus on tearing Ben apart. My feet were cemented into the ground. I didn’t want to look but I couldn’t turn away. 

Overwhelmed with sensory input, everything was muted for a moment as my brain was trying to process what had just happened. I thought about my Mother. I thought about my dog. I thought about the house I grew up in. I thought about my first girlfriend and Christmas and spaghetti and baseball and my teacher from the 5th grade. I thought about the things I had wanted to do before I died. I realized Chloe was screaming at me. She yanked me back in the room and shut the door, and I fell to the ground.


**Entry 35** - Friday, 11:17 PM
The zombies are done with Ben now and back at the door. It sounds like it’s about to break. The fire appears to have hopped the courtyard and made it to our building. Thick black smoke is pouring in through the vents, and the wallpaper is beginning to melt off. Chloe cannot breathe. Spooner is going in and out of consciousness. The emergency lights have shut off.

I’ve put all the fentanyl stamps I found in Spooners pocket under my tongue. I took the rest of the Xanax that was left in the bottle from the nurse’s office. I just hope to God that I will OD before I burn to death. But really anything would be better than the way Ben went. 

In the unlikely event that someone reads all this, please tell my Mom that Chip says he is sorry and that he loves her very much. 

Signing off now, 

*Charles Winslow*

Ch. 1 - **Elle**

Elle’s gaze lingered on the shaky signature of Charles Winslow until a gust of wind and ash prompted her to finally peel her tired, bloodshot eyes from the final page. Scribbled amongst these burnt pages was a whirlwind story of the last days of a fellow survivor. She felt exhausted.

Elle took a step back, and surveyed the sunlit floor that was formerly an office within a drug rehab. She knew the fire had taken place several months ago, for she had witnessed it from the the apartment across the street. But it still felt fresh. Most of the building was gone, but the pain, fear, and terror seemed to linger. It made her feel uneasy. 

Elle consider stuffing the notebook back in the vent where she had found it, but stopped herself. She eyed the two corpses, and took a small comfort in the fact that they appeared to have died human. She wondered which one belonged to Chip.

Elle hadn’t realized it until stepping over the crumbled cinder blocks and out of the room but she had been reading for the last hour. She picked up her step a bit, knowing that Chen would be wondering where she was. She tried wiping her eyes dry but ended up getting more ash in them and making it worse.

“Agh! Shit! Fuck! ...Fuck!” Elle screamed in frustration as she threw the notebook on the ground, breaking the spine and scattering the pages all around her.

“Elle,” shouted a voice, unseen but close by. “Elle! What’s wrong? Elle!”

“I’m fine! I’m fine,” she shouted back. “Fucking perfect,” she muttered to herself.

“Well come over here then, I think I found it!”

Elle began to move towards Chen, but caught herself, stepped back, and bent over to pick up all the pages. She packed away the disorganized notebook in her satchel and looked up to the bright, cold winter sun. She stood still for a moment. She unfocused her eyes and stared at nothing. And after her daily existential crisis was complete, she took a deep breath and continued moving toward the sounds of Chen repeatedly slamming his hatchet.

It certainly wasn’t the first time Elle’s heart has felt torn apart since the beginning of the outbreak four months ago. It was obvious that she had been building an emotional callus, but this one stung through.

The wind was blowing ever so slightly, enough to blow up the ashes into beautiful swirling displays. Elle zipped up her dirty puffy jacket all the way to keep out the chill. When she arrived at the spot where she left Chen was she looked around but couldn’t see him anywhere. It was precisely the spot where he agreed to stay. She felt a pang of anxiety pop up again.

“Hey. Down here.” 

Elle jumped back, startled. A slim shadow moved below her. She would not have seen him but for the whites of his eyes. He was several feet below ground level in what appeared to be the basement of the other burned down building. He was caked in black ash, covered from head to toe. He was camouflaged flawlessly with the blackened interior of the room.

“Jesus man, you scared the shit out of me,"" proclaimed Elle.

“Oh yeah, ha, sorry about that. But look here, I think I found it.” Chen said as he began to wail on a dented lockbox with the antique hatchet he had found in an empty apartment on the 5th floor.

Elle stood there with her hands on her hips. “And what fool’s errand are we out here for again?”

Chen paused and looked at Elle inquisitively, head cocked to the side. “For the key. The… key...for the exchange. The needle exchange that Jules said we need to get to.” Chen was never one to question authority. He was undoubtedly dense, which was sometimes annoying but also made him ruefully charming.

Elle rolled her eyes. “It was rhetori-- nevermind. Ya, so did you find it?”

“Well, there are definitely keys in here, I can hear them when I shake it, but I just hope they’re the right ones.” 

Chen let out what he probably imagined to be a fierce warrior’s cry and broke the hinge off the lockbox with a final blow. He proudly looked over to Elle, with a small smirk.

“Alright grab them and lets get the Fuck outta here,” Elle said as she motioned him to hurry. “They are close by, I can feel it. And this sunlight won’t last forever, clouds are approaching,” Elle stated as she pointed to the sky.

Chen stuffed the ring of keys into his pocket and climbed up the side of the basement, reaching out to grab Elle’s hand as she helped pull him up.

“You look like a goddamn chimney sweeper,” Elle joked as Chen stood up beside her.

“Damn right. I look badass,” he responded. 

Elle couldn’t help but smile as she wiped ash from his face with the cuff of her jacket. She grabbed Chen’s water bottle and backpack from the ground handed it to him. 

“Come on, let’s get back to the tower,” Elle began with a tired sigh, “Jules will be wondering where we are. And if these *are* the keys we need, we’ll be headed out tomorrow at first light. And as stupid as that plan is, you know as well as I do that breaking into the needle exchange is Jules’ top priority.”

Chen nodded and they began their short march towards the apartment complex across the street. Without looking, Elle reached in and felt the notebook, ensuring herself it was still there.

They crossed the cement path that surrounded the property and came up on the pointed iron fence. Fortunately, there was a spot where a enormous diesel truck had crashed into the fence, creating an opening. This is where they had been entering and exiting when they came to scavenge here.

Chen was whistling to himself while his was climbing over the roof of the red pickup when a large shadow moved over them. As soon as she realized what was happening, Elle looked up to the sky in horror. She saw that the clouds had been moving much faster than expected. 

Knowing they had both gravely misjudged the situation, Chen’s demeanor turned deathly serious as he reached out his hand to pull Elle up on the truck. He locked his eyes with hers and croaked, “Hurry. They’re coming.”

I'm planning on going to my general practitioner as soon as possible to find out what the pain is from.

In the meantime I've been taking Vicodin to quell the pain which works nicely, I take a fiber pill every time I take one but still find defecating to be difficult. Oddly enough the issue in my anal region doesn't affect my pooping and is only painful when I constrict the muscles such as when squeezing out a turd or the last drops of pee. 

My tactic while defecating is basically to let it freely come out on its own and only pushing rather than constricting the muscles like I mentioned above. When I do this however the poop basically has to freefall and I'm left wondering if I finished or not. What happens to any remaining fecal matter than you don't forcefully push out at the end? Does it make its way back into your intestines? Is it awkwardly stuck in your rectum until the next poop?",1516056537.0

We ended up driving around with who I presume was her fuck buddy for that week and I noticed that he had bags under his eyes that looked irritated and shit. Didn't think too much into it but I did suspect that he may have been doing H as well on his own time.



A couple of times I've had batches of dope that made the skin around eyes really itchy. It doesn't help that I engage cycling during the winter which can result in damaged dry skin but that on it's own isn't bad especially if you have lotion and wear appropriate protection such as a hat, mask and goggles. Really recently I had this happen and when I took steps to address it with lotion it got way worse, the fucking skin under my eyes got red and even swollen for a day. It was fucking crazy, I looked like shit.


&nbsp;

So a couple of times the skin around my eyes got really itchy, I rubbed it a lot and then tried putting vaseline on below the eyes and it didn't help as much as I hoped. I thought vaseline was a good all around fixer upper but in this case it was useless. Specifically the dry skin was causing me to get really well defined lines below my eyes and the Vaseline wasn't helping. Though it didn't seem to do any harm biologically. 


Then if you have dry and damaged skin and you put lotion it, it stings. If it stings you want to wash that lotion off right away because you'll just end up making that skin red, possibly swollen and will likely inhibit healing. 

&nbsp;

If petroleum jelly doesn't help and lotion doesn't, what does? Well apparently **vitamin A and D ointment.** Some times you'll end up with a crust after apply the ointment before bed but it's easy to rinse off. Which reminds me, I think before bed time is the best time to apply the ointment. You can use more generous amounts without worry about being too reflective in public. 

&nbsp;


Once I put lotion on really irritated skin and it got more irritated. To the point where the skin appeared chemically burned on my upper cheek and below my eyes. The vitamin A and D ointment helped resolve this and I didn't notice any negative effects. 

Only once the skin is healed can you apply more conventional moisturizing lotions. 

&nbsp;

Bottom line, if your dope makes you itchy around the eyes don't rub it the shit out of it. Once the skin is damaged from rubbing it too much, don't put any irritants on such as lotion. So far the A and D ointment seems to be the safest effective thing I've used.",1516050930.0

See my brother had one when he was 7 (I was 6), and it did not look like fun (to say the least). I'm also really scared of anesthesia (and I never had one).

But now? I'm still scared of anesthesia, but I also really fucking hope I'll get appendicitis someday, preferably soon. Just the thought of going into the ER with intense pain has me salivating. Why? well, because once the doctors run their tests and conclude I have appendicitis, I'll have to wait a few hours for my stomach to clear before they'll operate on me. Awesome hours those would be, as I'll be getting routine morphine shots while I wait.

And after the operation? Oh boy. That's when I'll get a constant morphine drip (likely one I can control with a button) as my body heals and the post operative pains fade. That shit sounds like fucking heaven let me tell you. 

I'm not aiming too high, my fantasy isn't unrealistic (like winning the lottery). It's actually quite a humble fantasy. And yeah, I know it's fucked up. Story of life.

I don't know if either of us ever got that stupid since but it was funny to reflect upon. As we approached eighteen, Tim once sold all of his PS2 games to get money for weed. It was obseved by another how that is junkie ass behavior but in retrospect we know it wasn't out of the same seemingly true sense of necessity an opioid junkie is compelled by. 

&nbps;

Last year I walked into him while going to the store, asked him about the kids, he asked about me and somehow we both started talking about roxies. Before I knew it, he was in touch with Cliff and then not long after that if he wasn't trying to buy roxies from Cliff, Tim was getting on board in buying H with him. On one weekend Tim sent 800+ messages to Cliff to get well for work.

*Note, Tim is not to be mistaken with Tom the icecream man.

&nbsp;

More recently, Tim finally heeded my words and bought subs (though I did suggest he go to a doctor) and he says he thinks he likes them more than dope and pills. Great! Well, not really.... when he told me the fucking dosages lol... bummer like damn.. no that's not how it works.

He was like ""the other day I took four subs and.."" Those were the 8mg strips. I tried my best to explain to him that more is not necessarily better with subs. That he's shooting himsself in the foot by boosting his tolerance, that he should taper his dose down to 2mg asap!

&nbsp;

I also went on to tell Tim the virtues of low doses and how it's great that it's possible to make a single sub last many days. He also offered to sell me some at double the normal price, he allegedly paid 50% above street for each. 


In conclusion, Tim is going to do what he wants to do. I wish I could convince him not to take 16mg of subs as a recreational dose but in the end he'll be lucky if he's stabilized at 8mg.",1516043082.0
