This has to be rock bottom. I am surprised I can even write this, because all I have been able to do is scream. 

Married for ten years. Two beautiful sons, ages 2 & 3. Three year old has glaucoma, and I'd do fucking anything to save his eyes. I've flown to two different continents to see if any doctor on the planet would transplant my eyes to him in the event he goes blind (there is no doctor) and going blind is a possibility at any moment. 

Had a heart surgery in 2015, been addicted to painkillers ever since. 

Got into a Suboxone program two days before my oldest boys third birthday. Literally, on my hands and knees begged them to get me ""sober"" by my son's third birthday. Been in treatment for 7 months, 12mg Suboxone. 

Upon relocating for husband's work, we lost our insurance. I applied for tax breaks, marketplace, medicaid, you fucking name it. Not eligible for shit. Marketplace is $1800/month with son's pre-existing condition, and glaucoma meds would still be $800 WITH insurance. Without insurance, looking at $3200/month to save his vision. Not to mention his every other month EUA's ($7500- 6 times a year). 

So I do what I have to do to save my boys eyes. Nothing more, nothing unnecessary. But not legal. 

Married for ten years, stayed by him for three deployments, 3 year long hospitalizations. Last three years of marriage, video games replace me. Cry myself to sleep every night he doesn't come to bed by 3a.m. because he's still playing, weekends he sleeps all day plays all night. 

Last month, went to home town and ran into old friend. Husband finds out, assumed I cheated (fucking NEVER have I) so husband wants a divorce. 

But, first. He turns me into the police for what I'd done to pay for my son's glaucoma treatment. 17 years prison, minimum. Grand larceny, burglary, extortion. 

 *EDITED to clarify never stolen from an individual*


THEN I found out my driver's license has been revoked. Evidently I ended my SR-22 ONE month early in 2014. Washington State mistakenly reissued my license. Fraud, they claim, that i didn't correct their mistake. Felony warrant. 

THEN charged with petty theft in my hometown. Forgot to pay for the soda on the bottom of my cart, they noticed, I didn't. Court November 5th. 

THEN today, as I am barely hanging on, I went to my Suboxone appointment. Two days late, couldn't afford to come any earlier. Two days late means kicked the fuck out, if I can go two days without it, I'm good to go says the doctor. Cold turkey here we fucking come off 12mg SUB. 

I'm breaking. Something in my brain has fucking changed. I can't do this. ",1539915375.0

When at the end 10-25 units, it starts to burn similar to a miss, but it's definitely going into the vein. 

Is it because I need to rotate IV spots more? There's a fat vein on my right hand that I've been using religiously (4-7 shots per day for the last week) because it works really well.

I ran through the black fairly quick (shit quality, started like glass and then went to straight syrup goo over a few days, foil trail was black and shitty,) and he offered some of his 'white' -- I immediately was remiss to try any of it knowing how easy it is to grab fentalogs and die from a bump. 

&#x200B;

After the black ran out I started doing tiny hits off the foil of the white. It never really got me high per-say other than just feeling well and the duration didn't seem to line up with any fent I've read up on. It was obviously mostly cut (it's a taste I've tasted in black before, probably a sugar or lactose)... what I'm wondering is what the fuck it could've possibly been. I'm at around 24 hours after my last dose with little to no feelings of W/D aside from some sleepiness, which is unusual after a few days on black let alone adding a few days on this mystery powder. Usually if I stopped black as abruptly as I did this powder stuff I'd be in a world of lame with mild W/D symptoms that can usually be curbed by kratom pretty well. 

&#x200B;

The powder has less itching, less euphoria, decently long legs (no feeling unwell even 12 hours after small doses), no vinegar smell, no marked sedation and didn't mess with my vision... none of these things aside from the less euphoria and no acetic acid smell lead me to look at fentalogs...

i just want to be able to think and react like a heroin addict and portray it as honestly as i can. i don't want to play a caricature of a person. this is going to be one of the more challenging roles i've had in a long time, so i'm excited for that but also a little intimidated by portraying something so unfamiliar.

i'm curious about thought processes and thought patterns. i'm wanting to know more about physicality... if i'm being too vague please let me know. i'm not exactly sure how to pose these questions. this is a first for me!

It's awkward because we all know it's a scourge, but like... It's also not this ultimate, holy grail of evil that Americans seem to think it is. I mean, lest we forget, clean heroin doesn't cause any organic tissue damage (unlike even medically prescribed amphetamines like Adderall). It's not neurotoxic, and in theory, if you took it responsibly, you could have it every day of your life and still live a long time. Arguably it's healthier than sugar and cheeseburgers if you wanted to really go deep into it.

There's so much misinterpretation about the opiate world. It's ironic I have to defend something like this, and have people tell me if I've taken it ONCE, I've ruined my life, and you might as well call it quits, which simply isn't the case. People are retarded.",1539889689.0

So I shared this story 10 months ago, and today is my 15 months so I figured I share this here as it may be more relatable.

So this happened a couple of years back, and it's one of those stories where you look back and think ""how the fuck?""

Anyways, I was fresh outta high school working for some dude from Isreal renovating this apartment complex from like the fuckin 1860's. I was paid under the table so i got handed cash at the end of every week.

I was pretty gone on heroin at the time, it was like finding the love of my life. A buddy of mine who I went to school with was from the hood and was selling some grade A 10/10 brown. I never really hit up this dude to just cop, we usually would get into some shit. Id drive him anywhere he needed and he'd throw me a few free lines of this nice 10/10.

As soon as we both meet up, i immedietely tell him he can drive so i can just chill after workin all day. I buy my usual $100 (whenever i got paid) and he throws me a free 20 (.1 g) of some different shit. Any dope he got was gonna be MINIMUM 8/10, so i just blew the whole 20. My eyes started watering as soon as i finished, and that bittersweet nasal burn was more intense than usual. Now it usually takes like 5-10 min of solid nasal burn before it subsides, and thats where the high REALLY fucking kicks in.

Literally 10 minutes later we're on the highway heading east, and I tell him im about to start vomiting. So he pulls over on the side of the highway so I can puke my brains out real quick. I get back in the car, and I felt so relaxed and content, basically reflecting where im at in life. As soon as we get to the light at our exit, im hangin out the window puking again. I didn't even care that people were staring at me, like we're in the fuckin hood this isnt unusual. Well everytime I finished puking, i was rewarded with the best high and the best euphoria of my life, so if I got nauseous at all, i wasn't hesitating to vomit.

I started to smoke what I bought, and thats when I started nodding out hard. He told me it wasnt a good idea do 2 different kinds, but like what does that mean? So once I actually decided I should just chill, we were bouncing around all these spots, hittin notes, hangin with some cool ass people for a minute. If you've every chilled with someone from the hood, then you understand its hard to grasp everything you do in a night because you're basically all over the place. I must've poked my head out of my window to puke every 10 minutes the whole fuckin night till about 4 in the morning. I don't even remember driving home, and its a solid 40 minute drive from the hood to my house.

Looking back, after being sober and all that, I cant even imagine how that couldve been enjoyable for anyone, but at the same time, I see what heroin does to your brain once you lose yourself on it. Every addict is different, and every person can handle more or less than the next guy, so it sure paints a clear picture on how bad things can REALLY get, and how much worse it can be if you keep following the path of addiction. Because any addict would know, its ALWAYS worse the next time around.

TL;DR: puked over 20 times in a night after railing a fat line of heroin, and still had a good time and enjoyed my high. DONT FUCKING DO HEROIN GUYS",1539879913.0

I’m starting to wonder if I just have anxiety issues, rather than anything to do with the Methadone.

I’m opiate naive. The only opi I could get was BTH from the DNM (I would get pills but they are all fake there)

I figured I could “microdose” heroin. Doing mgs at a time, and work up my tolerance till I would find it enyojable. But no

If I do too little I don’t feel anything pleasurable. If I do more I only get more sedated and queazy. Leaving enough time in between each redose does not seem to work for the purpose of feeling high. I just fall a sleep for 6 hours and wake up feeling awful

Doing an initial larger dose sends my heart racing, get super nauseous and disoriented. Just feels like shit

I’m thinking it’s just too powerful if you haven’t done pills before

Just snorted around 8mg in monkey water. Snorted half mL softly and held my nostrils shut while it absorbed. 5 min later I thought for a second I was going to faint while it kicked in. Then came the nausea. Now I just feel retarded, pukey, and shitty overall

The body is like dude wtf is this shit. I tried using in consecutive days. With multiple redoses to maybe get my tolly to an enjoyable level. Didn’t work

So for guys trying heroin for the first time if you’re naive, GOOD LUCK. This shit is not meant for rookies and can’t be watered down to enjoy it subtly

My doctor and I have went thru a huge list of different pain medications attempting to control it. The thing that's work the best is oxycodone 5-10 mg, but I feel guilty for it. Society says that you are a pos if you need opiates but I can't believe the change in quality of life between being on them and off them. It controls the pain and also fights off the chronic fatigue I've developed. I feel like I am able to live agian. My fear is if I am them I will become addicted and let the drug control me. Ways I'm looking to avoid this is using a kitchen lockbox thing I found on Amazon so I can't use more often than I am supposed to.

Questions I have for people experienced in opiates is how can I use them to increase my qol without losing myself? Is it worth doing na or some sort of therapy while on the drug to avoid letting it take over me? I personally don't mind the idea because the quality increase is immense, I love the idea of being at a point where I'm enjoying life agian and am not waiting to die. I just don't want to harm my loved ones like my biological parents did with a potential addiction.

I was so excited, going to pain management, thinking that i was going to get shots in my neck

Guess what this, next doctor said to me,

""I can't treat you""

WHAT LOL

Then this dude gave me a 10 minute speech about Suboxone

The nurses then told me that everyone that takes opioids has heightened pain (which could be true if long term ABUSE, i dont fucking know)

Then they're like ""Go see our favorite neurologist, even if you don't have the money or your insurance won't cover it. ITS WORTH IT! ""

Ive already been to a neurologist. How do you think i got here in the first place

These people said my case is ""very complicated""

So how many doctors am i going to see? I am at 10 at this point.

That is NOT including physical therapy , chiro or accupuncture lol

This is pathetic

Every doctor that sees me just tells me to see someone else , which imo in this latest refferal was just their buddy . 

This is a sick joke

PS: If you haven't read my past posts, ive been on Buprenorphine/suboxone for over 10 years, only Buprenorphine till' recently i was given Tramadol for extreme pain. 

This is hopeless . 

Do i write a  bad review for each doctor?

What the fuck DO i do? like ????????

My mom just had 3 surgeries,
My father's cancer has just returned


so now im stuck and i probably wont be able to see any doctors for a long while . as i dont drive . 



My sub doctor tried to give me Lyrica  , but i can't afford it, even with the coupon its over $140 . That would atleast calm me the fuck down temporarily . I forget to take Klonopin, or rather would only take it before bed . 

Neurontin aint that great

And the muscle relaxers are fucking garbage . atleast the ones ive tried. Soma is the best, but they're all still garbage.

Hopeless, utterly hopeless, i am legitimately better off possibly treating myself

BTW

I have received shots in my neck before 

So idk why this dude is ""uncomfortable""

Not only have i received them before but i received them on the first visit to a diff doctors office whom accepted my insurance at the time but now does not . 


Everyone is fucking sick and fucked up and only looking out for themselves

This guy that told me he couldn't help me and that i was too complicated LOL was a surgeon who ran the pain clinic at the local hospital . the Anesthesiologist was a fucking weirdo . 


so yes, i can blanket term say that , all doctors, for most problems, are fucking horrible, if you are me, if you're on suboxone and haven't already been receiving help or help from the right people . i just remember that things were easier 15 years ago when i was younger, eerything was easier and the doctors were much nicer in general tbh ",1539856100.0

I was going to try and detox with 60 mg of methadone( 20-15-10-5 then stop) but my dealer only had 4 at the time and said he'd be able to get more but unfortunately he couldn't. So I've been holding onto them and yesterday I woke up, smoked my last point of black and figured I'd take 20 mg so I wouldn't need to pick up more and save some money. Just to preface, I've only been using for about 2 weeks now(not in total, just since my relapse) smoking about 3 or 4 points a day. 

I've never taken methadone before but from what I've been told is that if you do get high from it, it isn't too enjoyable and is more sedating and long lasting. Well, I didn't get any kind of ""opiate"" like high from the 20mg i took yesterday and the 20 mg I took today. But holy shiit, I got a crazy mood boost. Almost cocaine like but without the stimulating effect. I was felt great, and was super talkative. I had to interact with a lot of people today and I was talking my head off(while usually I'm not too much of a talker) and a lot of people noticed and were remarking that I must've had a good day. and I also didn't get sick, so that was nice. Overall, it was really nice and definitely wasn't expecting that, anyone else experience something similiar to that?

She went through hell loving a junkie, and always trying to help him get his shit back together. No matter how hard he would try to push her away.  
I know her in passing, and she's always been nice, but we've only hung out once.  
I know she's pretty square, only drinks occasionally, plays a lot of WoW.  
I just don't know how she would feel about hearing from me. From one of ""those"" friends.  
I just want to tell her that I'm sorry for her loss, and that he was loved and will be missed.  
How can I be sure I won't just be turning the knife?  
How much could she possibly care what some punk loser thinks of the man she was with for 10 some odd years?  
Will she want to hear that he was loved, from someone like me? Someone else like him? Do I, did my relationship with him, represent the very thing that took him away from her?

So to the question, can I crush these Oxy ER 10mg and snort them like the Oxy IR 10mg?

Soooooo I began texting the dboys to see who was around. My fav guy was at work until 5:30 but one of my other guys was able to come by now. It was about 11am

So my husband and I decided to just spend $100 now, and hold onto the rest for whatever reason and I'm so glad we did. 

Dude shows up about 45 min later and says ""I'll give you 1.5 and you can owe me $50"" 

Ok that's cool. I should've known something was up then. This guy never fronts. 

Anyway, he leaves and I go to prep some shots when I realize its not dissolving and it's not drawing into the syringe easily. So I take a closer look, and it smells like chalk. 

Well, fuck.

I snort a little bit just in case to no avail. 

We are pissed. Obviously. 

It was around 1 ish o'clock so I texted my other guy to see if he would come out after work for $140. He said ok.

Thank God we didn't spend more money this morning!! Something told us not to for some reason. 

Dboy #2 got here at about 6:15 which was way faster than I thought he would, and hooked me up with 2gs for $140 (usually $100/g)

So in the end it worked out, thank the good Lord, because if we would've lost all our money I dunno how I would've handled it.

I felt no pain during withdrawls no vomitting just restlessness and sweating. That has subsided after 3 days and i feel fine now just a little trouble sleeping. Why is it that i didnt feel any pain? Did i not use long enough? Id say the mental part is the hardest part but I dont know if I can hurt my mother anymore I just think of her if I ever get an urge. How long does the mental part last for someone with an addiction like mine? I was fairly good at keeping my addiction at bay and I know my addiction is nothing compared to the majority of you guys.

I do just that and the dude actually seems legit not asking for gift cards and all that other BS but he does require that the first deal be paid for prior to meeting up via bitcoin at a minimum of $200 and all subsequent deals would be cash on delivery. He says this is so that he can be assured that I am not a cop which makes sense. I mean I’m pretty sure cops can still buy and send bitcoin to people but the chances of them doing it in the amount of $200 are probably pretty slim I would imagine. So I guess that would give him more peace of mind if I do this however I know it is also a risk on my end. I’m torn because his prices are super legit on the blueberries so it’s almost worth the risk of losing the money if it does work out. He even sent me a pic of the goods with a paper next to it with the date and my username which made me feel better about it.

I chased a tiny piece and left a trail, had it running way better than any #4 I've smoked before.

The second time I went over the trail the dope pretty well completely vaporized except at the end where there was a little glob that ended up getting a bit burnt.

Never had that happen usually the second time I go over the trail it just goes black.

Pictures are attached here http://imgur.com/a/3Olvx5X

It also gave me a real nice buzz for such a tiny piece especially for my tolerance being on a 70mg methadone dose so I'm pumped about that.  Anyone seen it vaporize like that going over the second time before (maybe it's normal and I'm usually getting lower quality) or have any idea what it could be?  Thanks !",1539805857.0

A year ago I started dabbling in Kratom and quit after about 7 months of using maybe 5g a day if this even matters. 

Skip ahead 1 month I rupture my Achilles while working out. So of course I’m prescribed a bunch of shit but here’s the thing....... It’s 50/50 whether I get a warm buzz or have literally the worst panic attack in the world.  I take 5mg oxy I might be okay. I take 10-15 (still prescribed dose) and I’m on the verge of going to the ER because my heart rate is all over the place, totally short on breath and i actually feel like I’m dying.  There is no underlying warm buzz, no nod, no relaxation. It’s literally the worst feeling in the world. It goes away almost completely after about 24 hours. 

What the fuck is going on???  I also want to say that while at this point there is probably some mental anxiety involved in taking it, this is a 100% physiological reaction that I have never experienced or even can find anything online about.  I’ve read about paradoxical reactions but there’s very little data on it with regards to opiates. 

My only thought is it could be some kind of paws effect from the kratom that’s fucked up my receptors. I’m really at a loss. Not only am I in pain but Where the fuck is my euphoria. It was the one upside of this cluster fuck.

Wasted about a quarter g, so nothing excessive but still fucking pissed. Managed to salvage some, but now I got this tar covered in fucking doxyaline and all those fillings and binders. Tried smoking a bit and tasted like utter crap. 

Hey guys, so I know there's a few posts on here about making powdered BTH. essentially from what I gather, is you mix 2:1 tar to powder in a empty pill bottle with a nickel and shake and magically it turns into powder. I'm just curious from people who have tried it. 

From what I understand snorting has a higher bioavailability than smoking heroin(which is my current ROA), so this cheese should theortically should be stronger than smoking. I want to try this just for the novelty out of it, but also because money is getting tight and I figure I'd get more bang from my buck this way. Looking at the sidebar, smoking has a 35% bioavailability versus 44% with insufflating, so a 9% difference. So just curious to people that have done this, did you notice this cheese being stronger than just straight smoking black? Is there anyone here that exclusively does this over smoking? 

Also a kind of side question, I know some people use benadryl over baking powder for this. But any powder should theortically work right? I have some doxyalmine, which I figure I'd use since it's an antihistamine but also because I don't have any baking powder or benedryl and don't really wanna spend the few bucks on it lol.

About 3 years ago I was diagnosed with a nerve issue. Jumped through a million hoops and spent a ton of money on tests, dr. visits, etc. Found a legit PCP that was willing to subscribe me a decent dose of hydros. Nothing crazy, but enough to take care of the legit pain. After about 2 years the doc left the practice and I had to see a new doctor through the same office. Well the new doc is kind of a dick and has made it very clear that they dont want to prescribe me what I'm taking. Stating the only reason they continue to treat me is because I was already being treated by previous doc (basically grandfathered in). Well things changed with my insurance and I am now having to pay 100% of my health insurance (previously paid through work). The monthly payment is fuckin expensive.

I want to change insurance to save money on my monthly premiums, I dont trust my current doc wont try and stop prescribing me opiates, and lastly because my current doc has said that they do not prescribe anything stronger than what I have been on. I've gotten several comments that I should switch to pain management, but I wouldn't be able to do pill counts/ piss positive for my meds at the end of the month (because I use them all in the first week or two).

 Since changing docs could mean loosing my script, I wanted to get some feedback from  you beautiful peeps. I have 2 questions;

1. Is it possible to make an appointment with a new dr., let them know my situation, and ask if they would be able to continue my treatment if I make the switch? I want to find out before I switch, so if they won't do it I can continue to go to my regular doc. Not sure if that would be considered ""doctor shopping"".

2. Does anyone have any advice for finding a primary doc that isn't on the anti-opiates bandwagon? 

Thanks in advance for any advice.

TL/DR: Should I change docs and risk losing my script to save money on insurance and possibly get stronger meds?",1539781466.0

And to no one's surprise the rehab I'm in is 12 step based. I think there's value in these programs but I also have some gripes with them. 


YOU CAN SKIP THIS PARAGRAPH it's just about how I feel about the details of aa. I guess as I see some of the components of this program are meetings, calling your sponsor/other addicts, complete abstinence, working the steps, having a higher power, and being of service. I think the value of meetings comes from maybe just seeing that recovery is possible, being able to relate to people if you feel alone/isolated, simply filling up your time, and most importantly having a support group if you're thinking about relapsing or having a tough time. But 90 meetings in 90 days and multiple meetings a week does seem like a lot and idk if it's necessary. Calling people keeps you accountable and again gives you a support group, but again doing it every day seems like overkill and most of the time you end up talking about nothing. But then I hear it's about getting into the habit of 1) calling people so when you really do need to do it (like if might relapse) it'll be much easier and 2) doing things you don't want to do so you get better at not giving into impulses more generally. And idk about complete abstinence like if I smoke weed and drop acid or do nitrous would it really take me back to h? I'd say it depends on the person and asking for abstinence from everything is playing it safe just in case. The steps I see value in cuz you face the consequences of your actions, admit you can't go back to your doc, try to become more honest and accepting and less critical and stuff. The higher power thing I've sort of just used the group/the program because I'm definitely an atheist and a lot of the HP talk doesn't make sense or is contradictory. I think being of service is something that everybody should try to do regardless of whether it's in the context of AA or addiction. I feel like that's where fulfillment and purpose come from. 


So I guess the parts of the program I like are the community and support and meaningful relationships where people care about you, being more self aware and honest, and finding some sort of purpose or meaning (even tho I think the universe is inherently ""purposeless"" or whatever it wasn't made for humans or anything I think that meaning and purpose is self made and to some extent arbitrary). But as I said there's also some things I'm not a fan of. Have any of you been able to use the parts of aa you like without fully committing to everything and done fine, maybe supplementing your recovery with other things? I mean part of me acknowledges that if ii just did everything they asked and ""turned my will over"" I'd probably stay sober, but part of me is hesitant, which I should probably explore. If it's something as simple as I'm too lazy or anxious to call my sponsor every day I shouldn't let that stop me from staying sober if it's what I need. I know that some of that is just not wanting to become ""one of those"" AA people which is kinda stupid and embarrassing but it's there. I guess the argument is it's not much of a sacrifice to try the program out but the results of being sober are amazing (which I know they are). Maintenance is something I'd consider in the future but I'm gonna be on vivitrol for a couple months. Just looking for insights into how some of you guys managed to stay clean. Thanks!",1539760040.0

I am a daily user of H, administered via IV, using 4 points a day. Sometimes twice a day if I'm partying. 

Ive always wanted to try dilaudid due to the crazy rush everyone is always talking about, so I grabbed 4 of the 4mg white rounds for 50$, think I got a decent deal. Maybe I got ripped off, either way it happened.

I prepped two shots of 8mg each by crushing them down and cold mixing with 50 units of water, and filtered with a cotton. I did them back to back and didn't feel a dang thing. 

lesson learned: maybe try 16mg in one shot next time, or maybe 24mg.

tl;dr: I have been plugging an 8 ball of tar for a few months, been clean for 3 days. 25mg of oral hydro got me to the upper end of my functional level of intoxication... When a few days ago 100mg of oxy didn't do anything but make me not sick...How!?!?


So I've been using opiates for the past 3 years, mainly hydrocodone but when I was ordering on the DNMS a year or so ago, I got my first bag of dope on accident of course, but seeing as I live on the west coast I couldn't resist trying the point of #4 I got. Once I got a taste of that I began to search for Roxy 30's so I didn't have to pop pills any more as I could sniff it and seeing as how I used coke all through high school, seemed more natural. Fast forward a few months, I have a banging job and have more money than I need. So I go on a bender. After more days high than sober I realized I needed to take a break but I was scared of withdrawal but my Roxy supply was dry, so I managed to taper off using cheese surprisingly (black tar cut with inert powder so it may be sniffed). After a few months of sobriety and a few stressors in my life I went on a bender using tar, (plugging this time because I was tired of wetting tar and mixing it with nootropics) a gram every day or two... I've been tapering off for 3 days? No neausa or anything but anxiety and the runs coupled with the pain in my legs was enough to call for some Immodium. I just kind of slipped up again by taking 25mg of (oral) hydro but... Im... Like actually high. This is a heavy buzz... When I was tapering down the tar before going cold turkey (from a ball a week habit) 80mg of plugged hydro wouldn't do diddly. Same thing with eating 100mg of oxy in a day.(on that same note plugging 60mg MS Contin pills was crazy... One was great, two was too much, 1.5 was bedtime...) I think I can stay clean for a while to let my tolerance go down and try to deal with the issues I've been dealt but I'm kicking myself ... How is this possible? Is it my switching of ROA? It bewilders me that 25mg hydro hits me like this when I'd need to use a good amount of my tar to achieve the warmth I'm feeling rn. Could my black be that shitty/cut? Or am I just weird? 

Any suggestions will help. I'm curious what is going on with my system and why pills are hitting harder than black... Based on these answers once my toll goes down I might try to get more #4 or just hold out for 30's when they're available. I don't like running out of drugs, and I NORMALLY use enough THC to get me where I want and help me through my anxiety but nothing beats coming home after a long day, taking a line and playing videogames, coding, reading, writing, or simply laying down listening to Pink Floyd and the dead as the rest of the world melts away. But it scares me that if hydro hit me this hard, my regular dose of H may have killed me . ",1539748719.0

I erased my older reddit account that was full of drug related stuff and also started listening to different music, all of this to rewire my brain and make me think like a ""non-addict person"".

This plan lasted 3 days before i bought more dope and it even wasn't because of withdraws (i don't use enough to get into withdrawls) but because i missed the feeling.

Now, after 3 weeks i came up with a new plan: Yesterday my company paid me my salary and instantly i paid all of my bills and transferred all the remaining minus $50 to an investment i have that forbids me to withdraw money unless i'm willing to pay taxes and literally lose money. My company also pays for my public transportation and food with their cards so i literally had $50 to survive the next month and all this to make sure that i don't spend it on dope (because with only $50 i would need to manage my money very carefully).

Today i paid mine and 3 other friends our lunch with my company's food card and told them to pay me with money because ""i didn't had a lot in my wallet and didn't want to go to an ATM"". After getting out of work i went to the trap and copped with the money my friends gave me.

If I decided to take some Oxy or H today or tomorrow will that put me back in withdrawal? If so, do I need to wait my normal 10-12 hours to take a sub?

What are the principle differences of chewing my Oxy vs swallowing it? I have a fairly low tolerance (maybe 60mg of Oxy on a strong day), so normally take a half of a blue at each sitting. Not really looking to nod out, just enjoy the chill, some minor eye rolling, etc.

Today, instead of just swallowing my half, I chewed it up a bit before I swallowed it. I was expecting it to probably hit a bit faster, but it also seemed noticeably stronger, which surprised me.

Was I imaging things, or does chewing it up increase the perceived strength? Additionally, I understand snorting greatly decreases the time it takes until you feel it, but also wears off sooner. Would the same principle apply here? ",1539668595.0

But when youre an addict as some of us are you dont have a care to give a shit about yourself. 
The only reason one can find to care about ones self is sinply because someone you care about cares about you. When you loose that person you loose everything. Relationships in addictions will always be flawed, because you have to care more about yourself to be able to relate and care for someone else. 

Not to say addicts cant care cuz some of the ones i know and have met are the most passionate and caring types. Almost why we become addicts is because life beats one down and is cold and favor you when you detach and dont care. 

Its hard to connect with others when we go thru this gauntlet and thats why i think we connect so much when we do.

Before that, I was sleeping great. 8-9 hours a night, was even able to stop taking my sleeping pills over a month ago (along with all my other mental health meds).

*Now* I'm sleeping probably worse than I can ever remember.  It's like I'm tired as fuck at night so I go to bed at like 10pm.  And then I wake up less than two hours later.  I try to go back to sleep but can't.  Most of the time I end up having to get up and watch a movie or something for *at least* two hours before I can go back to sleep for maybe another hour or two.

My fitbit tracks my sleep but hadn't been syncing for over a week.  It finally synced this morning.  The most sleep I've gotten according to that, including daytime naps, since I started suboxone is LESS THAN FIVE HOURS.  It's *AWFUL*.  

To keep my bipolar disorder and severe anxiety under control, I need 8-9 hours of sleep a night.  Since I started having the sleep issues, I started taking my sleep meds again but it's clearly not doing anything.  

My GP gave me tizanidine as a muscle relaxer and that makes me tired as hell but it's not actually helping me sleep.  Neither is the hydroxyzine I was given to replace the klonopin I was forced to stop taking a few months ago.  My shrink/suboxone prescriber said that I can no longer smoke weed (I've got a medical card) because of potential DEA audits. 

Is this sleep shit a normal thing? I'm taking the suboxone as soon as I *really* get up in the morning (sometime after 8 or 9am).  I'm trying to get off my ass and exercise every day.  I'm working.  But I'm a cashier and I'm so tired I can barely count out change.

I always tell myself that relapsing will ease the pain of whatever I'm going through at that moment- but over the last 2 years I've noticed that I'm always incredibly depressed and let down by my relapse- like not even fleeting happiness.

At some point in my addiction I remember the excitement and joy that would come with a relapse- I'd literally get butterflies (the happy type) on my way to copping. Now its just the knowledge that I'm about to go down a dark and painful road- and then on top of that I find that I'm not even enjoying the high.

Have any of you relapsed after a couple months or more and been happy about it? Like you forgot about what you were missing and were happy to have it again?

IDK I never want to go back to full blown everyday use and thats almost always where it fucking leads me to- but I always feel like something is missing and I've been dealing with a lot of emotional pain lately. I'm just curious as to if its a complete lie that this will make me feel better in any type of way.

I keep chasing it as the solution to the way I feel but now it seems like it doesn't even temporarily fix that. IDK why I keep trying- almost like I recall the times that it did. I guess this is what they call chasing the dragon. ",1539631327.0

Sad at what I’ve become and I know all of us are capable of so much more. We all deserve peace of mind and a very decent life,I am in a very similar situation. First and foremost I want state that I want not mad at the world or anybody for what I have become these past months. I fully and wholeheartedly blame myself for these stupid decisions I make. For the past 8 months or so I have been abusing Oxycodone 30mg daily and I would never do more than 60-75 mg a day and I always used it orally never snorted or smoked it just orally. I would take one 30mg in morning and in mid afternoon I’d take another 30mg and sometimes I’d buy a 30mg break it in half and take a 15 mg at night. I don’t know how I’ve become this. I am an immigrant and came to United States from Somalia with my grandmother and older brother for a better life. I’ve always been a decent student and person I’ve never wronged anyone. I’m turning 24 in a few weeks. I should have completed college a few years ago but I found myself fucking around. But thankfully I am ready to quit and go cold turkey once again. I have tapered down my usage the past few weeks and I’m feeling relatively alright except for slight anxiety and poor sleep. But nonetheless I’ve set my mind in putting this dirty and shameful habit behind me. My family don’t know of my situation and don’t seem thing I have any issues. I gave my agonies and miseries by myself. I always have. Never had a father or mother in my life. But that doesn’t concern me much I could give a rats ass about them. I blame myself for who I am because I know I am capable of so much more. I’ve never used beyond some months . The last time I went cold turkey I was using much less than what I am using now. But that last time was hell for me and the biggest issue was that I had horrible insomnia and couldn’t get any sleep. It was fucking me up mentally too driving my anxiety through the roof. But eventually I started going to gym and keeping myself productive and after 3-4 weeks my sleep became better and anxiety became nonexistent. But since I’ve been using much more now and getting ready to go cold turkey I am very fearful of the withdrawals especially with the insomnia and anxiety I hate them the worst. I know eventually they’ll get better but just thinking about dealing with them gives me the creeps. I am ready to quit for sure. I used my last 30mg yesterday. Any suggestions on what I could expect and how long I’ll be going through withdrawals. 60-75 msg is a lot I know but I’ve read a few stories on here where loads of folks were using 200mg+ and have been able to quit and get there life on track. Talking about it very helpful I think this is my very first post on reddit about this issue. I’d gladly appreciate any helpful feedback on how to ease the withdrawals non medically but naturally and how I could stop myself from ever going back to this horrendous habit. Thank you for whoever reads this and helps me. God bless!,1539623484.0

BUT, I know there is at *least* one of you whose first opiate was hurr-ron. I'm going to need your autograph you fucking champ but really, what was it like? how much did you do? My first opiate was hydrocodone. *Blue Watson 10*. Yeah, I know you remember those bad boys. For some reason they always seemed stronger than any other tab huh? The crazy thing is the first time I tried it. I ate 3 of them. Total surprise, I was stoned and my buddy literally threw 3 of them in my mouth then went out to mountains. I remember feeling alriiiight, nothing special. I liked weed better. I didn't take any opiates nor care to until I was 18. At that point, I had been clean off drugs for a year. I had a real crazy reality check when I was 17 and went to jail for a night but that's a story. a helluva story. LOL (got a 2nd degree felony dropped to a disorderly conduct) I'll post later. I already had to retype this post because I'm an idiot.   
Anyways, yeah so my gf at the time gave me a blue 10, I took it with me to work but I waited until I got cut to take it because I didn't want to look fucked up in front of customers. ^((I was a server)) So I'm doing my side work then **BAM**. My whole life changed forever. ^(BTW she had tons of pills because her grandma had passed away and she was helping clean out her house and they had threw all the medicine in trash bag and tossed it. Well, she came back later and grabbed that trash bag out and the rest is history.) I literally felt like I was floating on the fluffiest cloud ever. I know you know the feeling. On top of that I was mackin' on big booty judy with my new found confidence I never knew I had. Remember the first time you felt that confidence?<3... That was 9 years ago. My DOC now is definitely morphine. I miss her so much. Her pins and needles in the most random spots. Her warmth rushing through my body. Sitting with a flushed face, a freshly lit full flavor newport, and of course my pepsi. Pure Bliss. If I feel like partying aka video games I gotta have a goofball.

I've never used drugs. It was obvious to me something was up when we first met and she admitted she had a problem. 

It was long road.  But she is now clean.  She's been on subs for over six months and is doing great with sobriety. 

I'm struggling with some things I learned recently. 

When I met her, I found out that one way she was funding her addiction was through sex work. I accepted that about her. At a certain point in our relationship we both decided to become monogamous.  I had no reason to think she wasn't faithful to me until recently. 

I was selling her old phone and was going to wipe it. I found a texting app on it and that showed she was meeting guys for sex/money pretty much right up to the point she got clean. 

I confronted her about it and she confessed. 

I consider this cheating on me. She says she couldn't control it because she needed drugs. 

This is probably true. I don't know why someone would do that stuff for anything except money. I also feel very betrayed and lied to. 

I'm not really sure what to do about this. 

Why do addicts turn to things like this?

I know she feels horrible about herself. She hates that she did this stuff. She has other issues that maybe she needs to deal with too. 

It's just hard for me to let this go because I feel personally betrayed.

I started browsing this subreddit after rehab because it was just interesting hearing about it all in there as 90% of the people I was with were for opiates.

I can wrap my head around ""getting well"" and how your tolerance gets so high that you don't even do it to get high any more, but feel normal.  I was drinking beer mainly over 20ish a day, and I couldn't even really drink it quick enough to get drunk.  I could get drunk if I drank liquor, but I really didn't like it and didn't want to get used to doing it, I suppose in a way similar going from smoking/snorting to iv in a way but obviously not exactly the same.

So towards the end before rehab I definitely didn't even feel normal unless I had a good 4 drinks.  I would shake and sweat like crazy and have panic attacks all the time.  The main reason I was afraid to quit myself though was because of how much I was drinking I was at risk for seizure or DT's and didn't want to die from withdrawals, but the actual acute withdrawal feeling wasn't the end of the world to me.  So my liver started to fail, went to hospital then right to rehab for a month and did actually end up having a seizure there.  

The opiate addicts there didn't really seem all that bad with withdrawals though, where as on here I read them as war stories.   I know they did sub taper them not much more than 2 weeks at most though if I recall correctly.  I'm just curious as to why when I read this subreddit lots of people stay using to just stay well or when they do get on subs they stay on them for years and not taper.  I'm also curious as to how you describe withdrawals, I think if I wasn't afraid of DT's or Seizures being very common with alcohol/benzo withdrawals I would have just stuck through it at home, so I'm guessing heroin must be a lot worse.

I reread this and don't intend it to be coming at anyone for still using I'm just to lazy to word it in a non blunt way, anyone can do as they please in my opinion.  Just as a lurker of this subreddit I'm just really curious.",1539581631.0

A few questions ...,"He had a spinal injury 1-2 years ago and was prescribed an insane amount of pills. When I met him he no longer had debilitating back pain, and was basically just giving half of them away and taking the other half at night because he just simply enjoyed taking them, and he told me that. He also told me he wanted to stop, so I encouraged him and helped him to stop filling his unnecessary prescriptions. 

Some time went by, once off the PKs he started to take benzos recreationally. At the time I viewed benzos as less dangerous, though I don’t know if that’s true anymore...He had a benzo withdrawal seizure but I also believe at the time he was still taking some of his fathers PK prescription- tramadol, and these may have both been at play there. Before I met him he apparently had 2 seizures from benzo withdrawals, both (at least the first) were prior to his back injury and painkiller prescriptions. 

He was honest with me about the benzos but initially refused honesty having anything to do with opioid use recently because I believe he did not want me to freak out and leave him after he promised he had stopped those.  So the week after quitting benzos after the seizure, I caught him nodding out last night (again), and after much arguing, he FINALLY admitted that he took a tramadol last night and has a “few other times my dad gave me some”.

How much does someone need to take to nod out? Just one tramadol? I’m pretty sure they are 100mg pills. I know he has connections for stronger painkillers and I had to resist going through his phone. He has nodded out on me with out with out drinking alcohol. From experienced users, what does it usually take to “nod off”.. like 10+ times in one night before 12pm? Also, if he did only take 1 tramadol, could the addition of some benzo have caused him to nod too? 
One last question, for a skinny guy, how much tramadol or opioid does it take alone (with no benzo) to cause a seizure, if anyone knows?

I get 120 7.5 percs from my doctor for my physical problems. I took 50 mg a day this time this month for 15 days or so. But I've been on them now for around 2 months without running out. I fucked up this month.

It happened again, I sometimes run out early and have to deal with withdrawals cold turkey + kratom. Well I was depressed and used it as a coping mechanism. I know I fucked up, I am just trying to make this the least amount of pain possible until I can pickup a new script in 14 days.

I have 20 pills left which i can break in half and I could take 1 and 1/2 pill a day for 14 days. Which gets me to my refill date. I really really really don't want to shovel 60+ pills a day of kratom in my mouth for 14 days.

Or I could continue getting high for 4 days and go completely cold turkey.

What is the least amount of suffering I can go through? I am 100% more worried about the pain than the withdrawals. These pills hardly touch it which is why I took more (I still know it was wrong and am willing to accept the consequences of my actions.)

Thank you, I am have no idea what to do. I really don't know if I am strong enough to handle both at the same time. I know my habit is nothing compared to the rest of you.",1539550585.0

Probably wouldn't have panned out too well... would've been susbsisting at best to get through to pay day.



The next couple of days I would've been lucky if I was off from work on both of them until I got paid.

Sometimes shooting the heroin but mostly just snorting and smoking it. Right back to the oxy when it was available. Probably fent in the heroin too but whatever it worked to keep me from getting sick. 

I'm on day 2 of this withdrawal and it's so hard. I feel like I'm fucking dying. 

I got 1000mg of gabapentin, and a 2mg Xanax bar. 
Not much I know but anything will help at this point, 

Not sure if the Xanax is real, it looks extremely legit but I don't want to take it incase it has fent, and I will just prolong my withdrawal. Gabapentin only works in high doses and I don't have very much. Kratom doesn't help whatsoever for some reason, just makes me puke no matter what strain. 

Anyone have any advice on what to do from here on? Should I take the Xanax ? I haven't slept a single minute since I stopped using and I have school tomorrow I really don't know what I'm gunna do at this point. I have 5 fucking exams next week. I have just been drinking like a fish, it keeps my mind off the withdrawal and if I drink enough it makes me fall asleep for a few hours until the alcohol wears off, than I have immediate restless legs and can't sleep. 

When will this get better? If I stick it through this week at school will I start to feel better next week? I have saved 5 oxy80s and 4 20s but I'm trying my hardest not to use them but at this point I almost want to take them JUST to be able to sleep.

They have been extremely supportive, especially considering I have no insurance at the moment (I was kicked off their plan because of my age). I am extremely fortunate, I know there are so many people in my boat who do not have the support system I currently have.  


So I'm going to my first NA meeting today, I'm a little nervous about it. But I know counseling and meetings can help so I'm going to try.  


Like many of you, I don't think I can do this without Suboxone. I have never come close to going to a clinic, and I'm going tomorrow for the first time (since it has been the weekend and today is Sunday). I have had a friend give me a couple subs to get me through the weekend without using H. I was worried that being on subs instead of H this might hurt my chances of getting Suboxone, but my friend tells me that if I'm honest with her doctor that it won't be a problem.

&#x200B;

But my parents are insistent that I go somewhere TOMORROW, and honestly I agree; it's for the best, the sooner I do this the less likely I am to go through these subs and go do something stupid. Wherever I go, though, I just want to know what the best way to ENSURE that I can actually get the script, as I don't know how hard they are to attain.  


I really want and need the 8mg strips, but the ones I've acquired off the street I have cut in halves to make them last through the full weekend. Should I be honest about this or should I just tell them I've been taking the full strips if I want to get 8mg strips?  


Also is there anything I should say or anything I should avoid saying to prevent them from holding off on giving me some subs?  


My friend did say that it will be okay that I have subs in my system and not H as long as I'm honest about it and why that is, is that really the case most clinics I would go to?

You don't know what is being cut with the H you get on the streets, and you don't know who you are dealing with. If you find a cool enough doctor, you can get what you need. Do your opiates but be smart is all i'm asking. also to sum this post up just wondering if anyone has tried this combo before?    ",1539500930.0

How I found H,"I want to share how I made the switch form oxycodone and hydrocodone to mexican black (which is all that was available in my area. I was using pills for a good two years almost daily and as you all know it gets expensive so I would run out and WD would kick in. Forutnatly I  was very lucky and never had a situation where I waited more than 24hrs before coming up on some pills. One Friday afternoon after scoring some 512's I decided to go to my barber since my hair was getting too long, one of my favorite places to get high was at my barbers, just sitting there in a lovely euphoric bliss while my hair was cut. While talking to my barber the topic of pills came up and I mentioned how I took pills from time to time, I was lying of course i did them every day. I asked him if he did ""anything"" and told me he did ""chiva"" which he told me was heroin. He showed me the brownish powder alongside some black rocks, I smelled it and for the first time got that vinegary smell we all know. I just thought to myself, ""I would never do that"". He offered some to me but I passed, and told me if I ever wanted to try some just to call him.

Fast forward 3 months later and I am out of money, my paycheck is 4 days away, and my plug wont front me anything. I had nothing left to pawn, no one would let me borrow money and I had already taken out loans from all the payday loan sharks in my area. ""Fuck it something will come up"", and I went to sleep that day, no WD yet. Upon waking up the next morning the restless legs began, my body started to ache, and racing thoughts began. By mid day I was about 36hrs since my last dose. The malia (term for the sickness in spainish) began to intensify and all I could think about was getting my hands on bottles full of pills, I imagined myself finding a large stash and getting well. By 3:24pm (I remember the exact time) I recalled the offer my barber had made. At that point I did not care, I called him frantically, told him I wanted to try some to see if it would get me well. Unfortunately he did not have any or money to buy some, ""fuck"" I thought, but he nonetheless asked me to go over to his shop, he said he could get some, I was unsure what he meant as he had no money and neither did I. When I arrived he had already called his plug and the waiting game began, good thing for me he arrived no less than 15min after I arrived. He asked me to walk with him, I saw a truck pull up and a mexican fellow greeted us. He intruduced me to him as a new customer, and my barber said that I wanted to try some of this product. So we ended up getting a free half gram. Plug thought he was going there sell a gram, my barber never told him he had no money XD the plug was not happy but later on he admitted he was ok with it since I became a good customer.

Moving on, I knew I did not want to go the IV route, so my barber dissolved 10cc in a syringe and I put it down my nose, at this point the sickness was at its peak. I let 5cc go and OOOWEEEEEE did it burn!!!! ""fuck it here goes the other 5cc, AHHHHHHRGHHH!!!""... minutes later a wave of calmness swept over my entire body as the sickness was eradicated and I just sat in the barber chair thankful for this moment, but I soon realized I had done heroin for the first time, something I vowed not to do..... I vowed never to use the needle... two month later............

&#x200B;

But, with opiates the chioces seem much more slim, particularly in the U.S. in the wake of all the opioid hysteria. Like, you can either get absurdly overpriced pills that aren't going to get you very far, and if you don't like that? Well you can jump straight to Lady Heroin which may be laced and kill you on the very first dose. 

&#x200B;

Plus, I guess I'm a little bitch about it too, like I have to take everything orally or sublingually. My sinuses and respitory system in general is very delicate so no snorting or smoking/vaping anything. No mainlining because, welp, I just don't want to go that road. Putting it up the other end? well I mean I'm not entirely opposed but mixing together and administering an enima sounds like a real hassle, lol.

I guess I missed out on all the relatively cheap oxy from the mid 2000s-mid 2010s I guess, oh well. I looked into stuff like Morphine or Methadone? Idk how I'll respond to that. May try Ketamine as well just to see how I respond to it.

I mainly want to keep painkillers around just in case I develope chronic pain or have an emergency, since they don't get my particularly high in comparison to other drugs like Shrooms, Ambien, and MDMA, which are my favorites.

I live with the rich, I live with the poor, I live down the street, and maybe next door.

My power is awesome; try me you’ll see, but if you do, you may never break free.
Just try me once and I might let you go, but try me twice, and I’ll own your soul.
When I possess you, you’ll steal and you’ll lie. You do what you have to do, just to get high.
The crimes you’ll commit, for my narcotic charms, will be worth the pleasure you’ll feel in your arms.
You’ll lie to your mother; you’ll steal from your dad, when you see their tears, you feel sad.

But you’ll forget your morals and how you were raised, I’ll be your conscious, I’ll teach you my ways.
I take kids from parents, and parents from kids, I turn people from God, and separate friends.
I’ll take everything from you, your looks and your pride, I’ll be with you always, right by your side.
You’ll give up everything…your family, your home, your friends, your money, then you’ll be alone.
I’ll take and take, until you’ll have nothing more to give. When I’m finished up with you, you’ll be lucky to live.

If you try me, be warned, this is no game. If given the chance, I’ll drive you insane.
I’ll ravish your body; I’ll control your mind. I’ll own you completely; your soul will be mine.
The nightmares I’ll give you while lying in bed, the voices you hear from inside of your head.
The sweats, the shakes, the visions you’ll see; I want you to know, these are all gifts from me.
But then it’s too late, and you’ll know in your heart, that you are mine and we shall not part.",1539469492.0

Why do so many photos and posts have benzos being combined with your opiates? 

Most literature (media, anecdotal, and medical - I work in healthcare) states that the combination of benzodiazepines and opiates is quite dangerous and greatly increases the risk of overdose. Is this an overstated risk? Is the combination just too good to resist? I would love to know more.

Nobody see that, its because I am in Brazil and we dont know how to deal with opiate addiction, I had a almost overdose (stayed fucked up and leaved to the hospital by the family - everybody just new you are addicted to cigarettes, weed, coke, crack, and everykind of a pill (morphine, dones, xan, valiums, kpins, phenorbital, somas, oxys, promethazine, dividol, really everything), including my opiate IV morphine addiction.

I go:
8am: 1mg kpins, 75mg ER lyrica, 20mg lexapro, 20mg dones
3pm: 2mg kpins, 20mg dones
11pm: 1mg kpins, 75 ER lyrica, 20mg dones, 300mg XR seroquel

I overdosed on I think 800mg of morphine IV along the day, 3000mg of somas along the day, 100mg of diazes, 8mg of rophys, snorted coke all day, with some crack pipe rounds. 

Black out, wake up 2pm with my unclke pushing in my bed to the hospital, telling him not to go, just to leave my there sleeping, I would get up sometime, telling it every second and forcing to my bed, he had more force, I was resisting going, but my family puts me on the car and take me there, blacked out. 

Woke up same day, 6am, sober, my family new everything, in my bag was everything, I was with many trackmarks, fuck.

My psychiatrist was on vacation, they dont give my any medication, just leave my under supervisation, my bpms were 35-40 sometime during this time, and my pression got down too, but wake up with my doc telling my it was a miracle, so, I was glad I was alive, but down there treatment.

 I was on 600-700mg day IV, started on 30mg oral every 6h hours, second day 20mg/6h, third day 10mg/6h - it stayed 3 days, then 10mg morph/8hr, with 10mg of dones on the night, then 10mg dones on the morning, then they put morph 12hrs 10mg, and 10mg of dones in the evening, so 30 daily, then just one dose of morph, after nothing, but 20mg of dones in the night, and then stabilized with 20mg/8hrs. All this with 2mg kpins/6hrs, to help like if it this help something, and that. Yes it was hell, more than hell, hell x 1000, I was begging them to just drop up the morph, I tried not to take, family discovered, and forced medics to see if I take it, so I am on 60mg dones.

Still feeling some discomfort, some early wds symptoms everytimes, restless legs, muschles aches, stomach discomfort, sweats, and some more symptoms, still hopes that my next psych up my dose of dones and put my on a manutention, even with all my family thinks contrary, and thinks I need a detox.

Now I've heard/read that other options such as oxy vicodin codeine can be less hard on the nausea. BUT from what I see/hear they are ridiculously expensive!!! A $1 a mg? Mother of God! I pay about $90 a .5 for H and its some of the best stuff you can get.

So, I assumed, the paramedics assumed, everyone assumed I just took too much. Stupid, I know, but here we are. The cops took my stuff, so I hit up my guy today. 

I just took .1 grams, like usual, but I still just got awoken off of the bathroom floor. Not narcaned this time, my roommate managed to slap me out of it.

I don't want you guys going out looking for it, so I won't say which is which. But it should give you an idea of how far dope travels and why I'm saying the entire NE Georgia region. 

Mods, if I put too much info on the location, I'll edit the post. 

Please be careful you guys. I almost died last night, and I almost really hurt myself tonight. This lifestyle is dangerous, so be as safe as you can be. Test your stuff. Don't take too much. Make sure that somebody is around who can possibly save your life. ",1539389622.0

After going four months sober for my first time, I relapsed around two months ago after my girlfriend left to train in another city. I started right back up with H and became dependent immediately. Very little IV use my first go around, but I began using the point a lot more frequently this time around. Though I stopped IV use a week before my girlfriend returned (only reason was to hide tracks), my tolerance had skyrocketed. Forward to two weeks ago, I decided to rob a good friend of mine for her Nintendo switch (tho I already had one) and other small possessions. I've never really stolen from anyone before (other than $20s out of my moms purse). My friend then proceeds to call me assuming that I had stolen it bc she knew I was one of very few people who could access her house. I denied the allegations religiously, and EVEN HELPED HER FILE A POLICE REPORT (yes. I practically called the cops on myself) long story short the device was tracked back to me, called my lawyer and told him what had happened, and he just arranged for me to turn myself in either this evening or Monday morning (I know the police don't sleep on the weekend but the city I live in, they are very incompetent and I can lay low enough). I'm probably going to be pretty ill going in.

Crazy what this devil turns a man into. I never thought I would be at this point in my life. It hurts to hurt people around you, though I look like a psychotic narcissist.

I'll try to keep it short and sweet. I just want some opinions on the matter

So my girlfriend is an ex heroin user. Like, it was bad. The kind of bad where she tells me stories about that time in her life and I can't help but cringe first and then cry. Her recovery was a struggle, but she made it through it and got clean. That was about the time I met her.

Fast forward to almost a year into our relationship. She started going through this horrible pain. She would lay in bed at night and cry. Cry and cry and cry. We would go to the emergency room. We went to doctors. They talked about cluster headaches. She couldn't find the answers she wanted. She tried doctors, chiropractors. She got MRI's of her head and back. Some recommended it was her cervical spine due to past traumas. She even had her sinuses operated on for a deviated septum. Nothing worked. Suddenly she found a home in the chronic pain community, and started looking into fibromyalgia. This started her to start saying that's what she has. Doctors have tried to give her many medications, but she always refused anything that was an opiate. Nothing worked and she would still cry about her pain, and say things like, ""I wish I could just feel normal"" and other things like you hear everyone in the chronic pain community. We live together and I have watched her cry and cry and cry and beg for her life to be normal. I believe it. But  suddenly she begins taking tramadol. It's her only escape from the pain. I was weary of it (for obvious reasons), but I don't want her to deal with this pain all of the time. I try to ask her to be open about it, but she never tells me about her taking it
I love this woman to death and I don't want to see her fall into an opiate addiction. One of the main reasons I fell in love with her was her strength.

So after a few squabbles asking her about the tramadol, she agrees to let me hold onto them and control them and just give her one whenever the pain is too much.

Enter this semester of college. She asks for the bottle. The reasoning is is that she doesn't want to be at school and suddenly have a terrible pain day. I think to myself, you know what? She's right. It could be bad
 I don't want her to have to deal with pain so horribly. Time passes and she never talks about it. I have trouble asking her about this, and because of her past this is a  sensitive subject for her. She gets very offended and brings up how everyone ever (family, doctors, me) see her as an addict. How she will never get out of this pain, and how she needs this to feel normal. I feel terrible. I cry and apologize. She's used up the remainder of her script  (which was fast compared to when I controlled it) but I reason that her walking campus all day is rough with her illness.

Today I find an empty script she had filled the 20th of last month in our medicine cabinet. 50mg tramadol twice a day is what the instructions say. She's never once told me directly she had it filled (which I asked her to be open about). She will say ""her medicine"" but she has several prescriptions, and the tramadol is the only I know for certain that is a opiate. SO I ask her about it. She got very defensive and pulled the same ""I need this to feel normal, I'll never feel normal again, I wish I had never told you about my past, all the same anger she gets anytime I ask her about it.... I don't know anything about opiates.... And I may just be freaking out... can anyone PLEASE give me some light on the stuff? Maybe some experiences? Some signs I should watch for?",1539334956.0

Why is it that opiates or synthetic ones cause this annoying  itching, what is it that makes your body release the histamine's? What's in the chemical that does this? Is there a reason for it etc etc?
Second question, what is it with opiates that stops you from pissing, I know that this happens to others, some get it worse than others, it's the same with itching, it's so Fuckin anoying if your at a public toilet and your stood at the urinal for ages, even though your bursting to piss, and eventually you give up for fear of being branded a cock watcher, what causes this water retention, the only thing I can think of is the body is numbed so much it fails to register when you need a piss, I don't know.

Feeling like a broken record, broken human, broken heart. 
Well tonight got the best of me. I made it five days. Got home from work tonight which I was proud of myself for actually fucking going to work. I start to feel a little tired, and of course as soon as I go lay down the restless legs come back full force. I’d been laying down since 9:30 PM, and now 2 AM and still no sleep. Took PM cough syrup, Benedryl, drank tea. Took a bath. Listened to meditation on YouTube. Nothing. Mind racing. I slept better last night ?🤔
I knew I had (yet another) safety stash, because well any good addict (possibly terrible*) keeps a just Incase Around, right? 
So here I am. 2:30 almost now at my parents house smoking the *truly* last 2 points I’ve got in my car. I can’t afford to miss anymore work and that’s where my job is headed if I can’t work a typical 6-8ish hour shifts. I’m not one of those people who can function off of no sleep. Sleep is my best friend. Hence why opiates are my game, because either I’m nodding and almost asleep or I’m legit asleep for dayzzz. 
I want to be clean so fuckin bad y’all. But it’s fucking mother fucking restless leg shit gonna be the end of me i swear..
This really is the last I have. I went to a meeting today before work. I connected with old clean and sober friends. I want this shit. But my body is fucked. I’m hoping smoking the tar will have less of an impact on the withdrawal cycle.
I’m fine with having a few extra days of pain I just need to complete a work week. 
Anyway, thanks in advance for any advice or even just fucking existing on this sub - y’all are pretty much the main reason I was able to get through day three. I’ll get back at it tomorrow. Peace and loves bropiates",1539336101.0

**Need to know info is in bold**

Intentions were that this was my last, nice big hit, end of binge. Blow out scenario. Nice speedball, **i'm very aware of and careful to avoid misses** as i once had several nasty abcesses (which I am happy to explaiin how I dealt with for those of you who refuse to see a doctor - although you should absolutely, always, deffo seek medical help) caused by sheer laziness/lack of knowledge etc.

Anyway\*\*, I noticed immediately that somehow the pin had slipped or poked through the vein i dont know what. But i instantly stopped and began readjusting.\*\*

i USE INSULIN PINS AND IT WAS ABOUT whoops soz for caps lock. **I use 1ml insulin pins, orange capped.** It was very full but i'd found a good spot on the long vger part of threin that runs from somewhere around the thumb and forefinso wasnt concerned it would get too full.

Hello [/u/Dylan-in-the-Movies](https://www.reddit.com/u/Dylan-in-the-Movies), please resubmit with a more detailed and especially non full capslock title.

**There was approx 4ml left in the pin when i noticed a 'feeling' and perhaps i was unnecessarily circumspect, but i drew back again - nothing. Dug around a bit and took in about 2/3ml of blood but as i said i am terrified of missing and won't inject unless the entire nee3dle is in all the way.. . So i've got about half of a really good hit. A third of it is blood. HELP?!?!**

I also have about 5/6 ml in a pan that obviously wouldn't fit in my tiny insulin pin. **There is no water in any of the mixture (no added water that is) just concentrated lemon juice.** So although I've ruined this hit trying to find a natural/household anticoagulant, I'll still get a really nice speedball, IF, i can stop this from turning into gunk

I still don't feel great but a hell of a lot better. Need advice on what to do, trying to get clean without detox or rehab (no insurance right now and already have been to rehab like 6 times) but it hasn't been easy.

&#x200B;

So I have a shitty dope habit (I do anywhere from .6-a gram a day, a gram being \~$100, IVing usually but sometimes I snort it if I need it to last longer) and I'm trying to stop. My boyfriend is on methadone but I really, really hate the idea of having to get up and go the methadone clinic every morning (I call it liquid handcuffs), almost as much as I hate tracking down the dope man every day. It's actually a hell of a lot easier for me to get ahold of my dopeman as he will deliver to me at this point, pretty much whenever. I feel great on methadone but the thought of being chained to a clinic forever, or trying to ween off methadone later in life, doesn't feel better to me than continuing to use. I have a love for travel, especially international travel, and being on methadone would more or less prevent me from doing this. It feels so limiting. At least if I continue to use I can still get high.

&#x200B;

Anyway I tried being on methadone for 5 days and got up to 60mg when I decided this wasn't for me. My boyfriend was disappointed but it's my life. I figured I would just go back to subs, even though I was having a hard time making the switch to subs before this. I used to be on suboxone earlier this year, and had no issue with it for \~7 months. I was even totally clean on them for 5 months. Hanging out with people who were using is what got me to go back to using heroin. I also felt like the suboxone was starting to make me feel depressed, but anything and everything could have been causing that.

&#x200B;

I used methadone, climbing from 40 to 60mg by increasing 5mg every day, over a period of 5 days. My last dose (60mg) was on Sunday at 9:45am. I did dope/fentanyl a couple times, about .6 on Monday and Tuesday, nothing Wednesday. To my surprise I felt really no withdrawal at all on Wednesday and was even out and about running errands. I had planned to take Subutex whenever withdrawal really started to hit. Finally on Thursday (earlier today), when it had been 90+ hours since I had taken any methadone and about 36 hours since I had done any short-acting opiates, I started to feel kind of blah and not great so I figured I could take the Subutex. I took 8mg sublingually. The only reason I did not wait until I was feeling more withdrawal symptoms is because I had not gone that long without anything or without feeling bad in a long time. I thought I may have accidentally detoxed myself. Stupid, I know.

&#x200B;

The PWDs were horrible... cold icy feeling in my veins, sweating like crazy, hot to cold flashes, goosebumps, couldn't sit still, felt like I was going out of my mind, crazy anxiety, irritability, depersonalization.... honestly it was horrible and at first as it was coming on I thought maybe it was all in my head until it got really bad. Somehow I was able to pass out and sleep for a bit and when I woke up my boyfriend was back from running errands (he knew what was going on) with .6 for me to shoot and that helped me feel better. I still don't feel 100% and I'm certainly not high.

&#x200B;

Was taking 8mg all at once my mistake? I had always been given this much at rehabs I've been at to medically detox from dope. Would waiting longer have helped me? I feel like I don't do that much dope that I should have to be in crazy withdrawal to take a sub. I never even get \*that\* physically dopesick.. Is it the methadone and (possibly) shitty metabolism that got me into this situation? I'm wondering if my body just wasn't rid of the methadone, which seems weird at 96+ hours when I had only taken it for 5 days.

&#x200B;

I never want to feel that again. We're going on a mini vacation (driving) for a couple days to Universal Studios this weekend. My plan is to do a little dope every 6 hours or so until we get back and then potentially try again with the subs or, begrudgingly go back to methadone. I REALLY DON'T want to do methadone but I am super scared of taking a sub ever again. I never want to experience PWD again, that was hell. Although I feel like I've read that now that I've taken some I should be ok if I take more? I have done some dope now too though. I've never had a problem with subutex or suboxone in the past. Specifically I never had a problem with induction. I honestly don't know what to do and need advice. I want to get clean and be a normal person again.

Well, this girl I ran around with a lot over the past year (she's always broke, sick, and asking for some when middling - but nonetheless a very chill, nice, reliable person) But now all of a sudden she is selling and has been keeping Opana stocked up 24/7. 

I called her today, and she needed a ride to go reup and was going to give me her price to take her. So obviously I did, and fast forward when she gets her shit she already has my 2, G74 Opana separated from hers.

Well, I've been noticing that these pills just aren't breaking down like they should be. Seems to be a lot less powder. We're pulled off in this empty parking lot shaving our Opanas down and once again my line looks much smaller than hers. 


I've never been overly concerned about getting fake Opana because they have an Orange coating and white interior powder so unlike the blue 30s which are uniformly blue throughout and much easier to press - I assume these would be much harder to ""Press"" given their 2 colors. 


But [This post has some really good, 2 color fakes](https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9ldwcr/strong_pressed_roxi_i_normally_do_80mg_and_half/?st=jn5cydpo&sh=df7270c4) has me concerned.

9nedex,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9nedex/iv_use_and_major_infections/,7,https://redd.it/9nedex,mindlessMiss,IV use and major infections,"Hey

I've used drugs intravenously for around 4 years, opiates (pills/fent patch, never heroin, not common where I live) and meth.

I'm generally pretty clean with using... use clean needles each time, use alco wipes and keep my spoone spickk n span. (lol) I see other people who are sometimes downright filthy but they don't seem to have problem idk maybe my immune system is just weaksauce. whatever PLEASE be super duper careful and don't end up like me.

3 times in the past 2 years I've had to be admitted to hospital, once was a serious abscess where my arm grew three times the size (I've had abscesses before and drained them myself, tried to drain this one and it smelled weird so I went to hospital and was on IV antibiotics for a week)

&#x200B;

early this year I ended up with a massive infection in my chest cavity, (not in my lungs but the space inside my chest where the lungs inflate). Started off with a mild twinge of pain in my back, just beneath my left shoulder blade. Ended up being rushed to the city hospital (I live in a small town with a small hospital) in major agony, they ended up jamming tubes between my ribs connected to a chest drain... then surgery after a few days.. more chest drains after that, all up about 2-3 weeks in hospital on IV antibiotics.

They drained almost THREE LITRES of liquid out of my chest cavity. basically PUS.  gross. no idea how long that crap was building up inside me. And I had no clue.

&#x200B;

Recently I started feeling shittier than usual. I was pretty much bedridden for 2 weeks or so feeling really shit but not really able to pinpoint any reason why... didn't want to eat, or smoke, wanted to drink and drink and drink unquenchable thirst, sweaty, couldn't get out of bed even just going to the toilet was a mission. Started getting a cough

eventually gave up being stubborn and very reluctantly took my dumb ass to hospital.  After poking around a bit, they rushed me to the city hospital again, on a plane this time (city is approx 1 1/2 hrs away by road, too slow they said)

turn out i have an infection in my heart valve this time. Plus patches of infection all through my lungs.  spent a month in hospital (was sposed to be 2-4 weeks longer but I got kicked out for drug use, long story)

So yeah apparently one of my heart valves is now fucked, which causes my resting heart beat to sit at 115bpm. (used to be around 65). Infection had attached itself to the valve and has damaged it.  I used to use a heart rate monitor while exercising and with max effort hardcore cardio workout I'd get up to 160bpm.  Walking to the bathroom and back (20-30metres)  now I'm at 140. 

apparently they can replace the damaged valve with a prosthetic one. But obviously they aren't gonna do that while I'm still a drug user. Trying to get onto the suboxone program but they make all kinds of hoops to jump thru first.

My doctor was a dick and rushed through the exam. The pressure check was painful because of my dry puffy eyes and took a few tries to get right. 

At the end I was surprised to hear that my vision had apparently deteriorated in the last 18 months or so and I needed a new stronger script. A surprise because I’ve worn the same prescription for 15 years.

Well, the point is i have a script for codeine, so i got the codeine legally, but pregabalin was bought without one (used to have it prescribed but the script expired so i just made up a story to the pharmacists and she gave me some) Will the codeine/pregabalin show up in my urine/blood tomorrow? Do they even search for it during the urine analysis? My countries health inspection and care isn't really that advanced as the one they have in the States, but i'm still afraid they might find it and ban me from the military.

What do I mean? Every time anyone posts about their Heroin use in this sub, some self-righteous soul comes along and starts to rattle off their list of anecdotes, telling them how bad Heroin is, like somehow they think that Heroin users may think Heroin is completely fine? SOME people DO use Heroin recreationally. Just because a lot of people can't, doesn't mean that nobody can. Aside from that, if every time someone mentions Heroin, a list of moralisers come along and cry about it, people aren't going to feel welcome to post about it any more. Every single time someone posts something about their Heroin use, someone's all like ""This is what I was like hur dur dur"" or ""All addicts started like this hur dur dur"". This type of attitude is not going to get you anywhere. Nobody who uses Heroin, whether and addict or a casual, gives a FUCK about what you have to say. Sorry if that seems rude, but people are going to stop posting about Heroin because of these arrogant douchy attitudes. I can see people may be trying to help, but when every single pro-Heroin comment is downvoted to oblivion, and the same generic anti-Heroin comments get a sea of upvotes, it really does just seem like Karma whoring. 

Acting in this way is also dangerous. People simply won't ask for help to do with Heroin. You're turning this place into somewhere people feel they can't discuss the topic. So people are going to stop. And when people do, that's damaging the cause of Harm reduction. That's not okay at all. 

I'm not trying to preach, but Yes I am a casual user. I use bi-weekly on Mondays and Fridays and then I do that for 3 months at a time, go cold for 2 months after. It's something I've just sort of trained myself to do. And for saying that, I got a swarm of people crying about it and downvoting me. It's just not okay anymore.

my boyfriend was addicted to opiates for 5 years (mainly methadone); i started dating him last october and officially in january. he told me about his addiction in december. i’ve been with him through every step of the process and he finally came clean with his parents in july and went to a detox center for 15 days. since then he has been clean of opiates and i’ve been so proud of him because of it. it’s something we’ve dreamed of — especially him — for so long. 

i found that he was being really distant with me and i figured it was because he is still going through the withdrawal process. even though he has kicked all of his physical withdrawals, i know the process lasts way longer than that for someone who has been addicted for as long as he has been. 

he’d be sitting next to me in bed and messaging someone on snapchat but trying to shield his phone away from me while doing that. i thought this was weird. it went on for a few days so finally i did the worst thing i could do, something i’ve never done and i never thought i would. i went through his phone while he was asleep.

sure enough he was messaging some girl on snap. calling her babe and all that, sending her songs, saying things like “be safe at the bars tonight luv” & responding to her pic at the bar with “i’ll take the blonde babe in the middle” (this especially hurt because he sent this to her while we were at my birthday party, lol). she asked if he had a gf and he said something about how we were probably going to break soon. (this is because i almost broke up with him a few days earlier over a fight we got into because i told him i was depressed and unhappy and he basically made fun of me for it so i got mad, and it led to an argument) he told her “i miss you” and she asked if he was in *our city* bc she lives in the next town over, and he said “i’ll be in *our city* for the next few days, come over some night and we can watch movies and mess each other’s hair up” lol


i was completely shattered and heartbroken. i always trusted him with my life and believed he’d never cheat on me because he was so mature and told me he didn’t understand how other guys were pigs because he already slept with a lot of girls in high school and got over that phase.

i woke him up (stupid of me because of course he was irritable then) and we got into an argument about it for like, 2 hours and naturally i wanted to break up with him but i didn’t. he said he’d change the way he has been acting (unaffectionate and distant with me). 

this was around 3 weeks ago, and last week he apologized again to me. but i’m still so heartbroken about it. i miss how sweet and crazy he used to be about me a few months ago, but every time i think that i remind myself that he was like that when he was on opiates. and that maybe now he’s acting this way because of withdrawals. i don’t know when i’ll finally meet the real version of my boyfriend but i’m willing to wait and see him. he told me yesterday he’s trying to figure who he is, too.

i don’t need advice, i want to stay with him and support him, it’s just so hard. i’m so sad and devastated over this, my self-esteem has really taken a plunge. i fucking hate addiction, i fucking hate opiates. ",1539231736.0

My habit was really bad about 2 years ago for a year straight, dumping all my money into this addiction with my gf at the time.

Within the past year I’ve been relatively good. Taking couple month breaks, saving money ect.

Just recently my boy told me about this girl and when I say she is MODEL material, I’ll never probably in my life be able to fuck a girl like this. Long story short, she fucks ppl to support her habit which is a serious fent tolerance habit. I’m 24, I never thought I would be paying for a girl to fuck, it’s not like I’m ugly just she’s way outta my league and i just moved into my own place. After talking to her she’s so nice and I just recently bought some Roxies to enjoy...spoke to her about getting High together bc no one knows i really do this and I don’t get high with anyone anymore since my last girlfriend, so it just sounds like a good time to enjoy with someone. 

I mentioned the roxy and she wasn’t even interested given the fact she said she wouldn’t even feel it.

IDK what to fucking do. The man side of me is saying fuck the hot girl and have a good time getting high together.

The other side is saying don’t be a moral scumbag and support a woman junkies habit who’s only fucking you bc you’re paying.

Just insight I guess is what I’m looking for.  And your guys thoughts:(",1539225516.0

I know methadone withdrawals are crazy and I don't want to go that route, plus my dealer is charging a lot for these pills($10 but I don't know street value of methadone as I've never tried). 

Any idea on the best way to use these 10mg pills to get off dope? I'm trying to get over this fast and I don't want to be using methadone every day. What do you guys think about something like this:
day 1: nothing
day 2: 10 mg methadone
day 3: nothing
day 4: 10 mg methadone

I'd like some advice from the other long-term injectors here. I'm currently getting to a stage where it's increasingly difficult to hit a vein, though I'm still managing. My remaining veins are very shallow and close to the surface and here in the UK they only do one size of needle at the exchanges which makes them very hard to hit since like 85% of the needle has to be out the skin and the tiniest movement knocks it out of place. 

I have done my hands, wrists, obviously my crook, forearms, both sides of my arms, found a few veins around my shoulders and have also done my feet & ankles. I have **never** been able to hit a vein in my legs at all. I haven't tried excessively, but I've given it a go many times and can never get blood except for the tiny tiny tiny veins on my knee and they are too small to hit. Since I've heard many people hit their legs, could anyone tell me where I might be going wrong? I know it's not the safest place to hit but I'm pretty certain it's safer than my femoral which is where I'm considering. 

I figure soon I'll have to start using my femoral, thus the questions. Preferably I will find some new veins before that - just a few months ago I realised I could turn the needle the ""wrong"" way so its pointed away from the heart and that allowed me to hit a bunch of veins on the far side of my arm that were at too awkward an angle when trying to hit them with the needle going in the correct direction, and that discovery gave me a few months of being able to hit my arms easily again, but those are in their death throes now. So, for the IV users:

1. How long have you been injecting, and at the moment where are you hitting?

2. For those of you who've had to resort to the femoral, how long was it until your other veins were fucked enough to make you do it?

3. How long has your femoral held out? I've heard some people say that it's so big & thick that you will always be able to hit it and get a flush of blood and it never becomes unhittable like the others, but I'm dubious.

I can totally delete this after someone answers if it is intrusive on the sub, but I looked in the search bar and didn't find anything really useful or pertaining to my situation.

I shot 30units of powder heroin into the vein below my thumb on my wrist. It was my biggest vein aside from my elbow, which I already shot and missed in. 

1. Is it normal for the site of injection to be really sore even 6 hours post shot? It throbs painfully when I walk with my hands by my side. My missed elbow shot doesn't even hurt that bad. Theres no redness, swelling or anything like that. Just hurts lol.

2. Is it normal for my pointer and thumb to be slightly tingly and numb at certain times and spots? I'm worried I blew the vein or fucked something up. I registered and then reregistered right at the end of the shot and it didn't look like I missed. I didn't remove the tie after I registered (I know dumb but I was afraid of falling out of the vein) but it was only 30 units so I didn't think it was that bad. There's also no bump like in my elbow. I got the rush etc, so I'm not sure what my wrist is doing, but it hurts lol. Maybe it was the cut?

3. Is it safe to shoot in the same vein even after I missed in it less than 24 hours ago (elbow) or in the vein in my wrist even though its acting funky?

Thanks for any help guys! I really appreciate it. :)

She drops me off and as I'm crossing the main road to go into this complex of flats that locally called White City. This guy shouts on me that is a total reprobate harmless really but he's always trying to pull something and by the black eye and multiple stitches in his eye brow he recently pissed someone off lol 

   Anyway he asks me where I was going and say I'm just off to score he then asks me if I could give the girl he's with ""10 units"" as he needs to get home and the bus is due. I kinda know the girl because last year my ex girls friend out the blue decided to rob her and stabbed her in the head a couple of times nothing too serious just a couple of lasirations. This was in a house full of folk including my exes Dad when she decided to pull this stunt the crazy bitch.

 So I agree and she comes with me and he fucks off to get his bus (apparently) . As I'm walking with her she tells me that she had just scored for the guy and he had promised to help her out if she got a couple of bags for him. But obviously his intention was just to dump her straight away and luckily they came across me just as I was getting dropped off. What a fucking arse hole. 
   
So we get to the dealers and he invites us in and he's out his nut nodding off every couple of minutes he had just returned from a funeral in the morning .I ask him for a couple if bags (£20) and he starts making them the first ones a normal bag 0.25 but the second one he's constantly nodding and weighs out to much 0.37 but he decides to give me it anyway as he cant be fucked mucking about with it. I ask him if it's alright to do it in the kitchen and he agrees so I do the bigger one with the girl and give her half of it. I stay for a little bit and then leave and tell the girl I need to go up town and I'll catch her later.

   Go up the town a walk and go to the Chemist and get more tools (syringes,spoons,citric etc) for through the week. As I'm walking through the arcade going for the bus I bump into this guy again and he asks me if I'd seen jade alright I tell him yeah I gave her half a bag and that was a scum bag move he pulled on her and he had no intention of giving her anything and walked off before he could come out with some bullshit excuse and went for my bus. Got in the house and did the other bag and I've been playing Spider-Man since then. Not the most exciting of stories but hey that's how my day went in Bonnie Scotland. Hopefully my guy that delivers will answer his phone in the morning and I won't have to go into town again tomorrow.",1539201578.0

Just took a piss test for a new job. Drank a gallon of water, took multi vitamin (for color and specific gravity), took creatine + citric acid (byproduct is creatinine) and pissed mid stream. 

I haven’t done any opiates other than bupe for the last 3 days. 

Any thoughts on my process or input? I’ve used this several times before but I was worried this time because I took an at home piss test yesterday morning (when it was originally scheduled, but I begged off and got it rescheduled because it spooked me after I failed in my car). 

Can 6am be tested for specifically in hair? Wondering about metabolization. I have a rx for Vicodin. Don’t both H and Vicodin both ultimately end up at the same metabolite?

I just find it to cause really bad headaches and constant sweating than i wakeup suffering basically at 5am drenched in sweat. Ive only been dosing in the morning from about 6am to 1pm one tiny bump every 2 hours.

I think this is just fentanyl not some other rc? but who knows i just think that because i seem to go into withdrawal every 2 hours and everytime i dose it i feel worse and worse. So would this even be safe to take clonazepam after my last dose at 1130? I really have no experience with this stuff and want to just throw it out im scared the half life of fentanyl will interact with the clonazepam.

I used a fairly large dose of morphine last week on friday, so five days ago. I drank a lot of water throughout the week and also before giving urine. Now, every single online source I've found, from acedemic studies, to the official stance of the national institute of drug abuse (NIDA), to rehab sites, everything on google all say morphine is quickly eliminated from the urine in 2-3 days max, so please dont tell me to just google it. if you have a credible source like a study that says otherwise that would help. The doctor sent it off to the lab and if it comes back positive there he'll send me straight to a inpatient detox. im doing a benzo taper too so if they test it for specifically what benzos im fucked because ive been doing it with something else than prescribed. this sucks hard because I just about kicked the benzos and the doctor says once i did that in a few weeks he'd switch me from methadone to morphine maintenance which will eliminate the need on my part to do morphine. 

TLDR
in every study and paper by the NIDA and other sources it says morphine is eliminated from urine after a max of 2-3 days. I took 100-200 mg of morphine 5 days ago on friday and was tested today wednesday. he said it was positive for opiates and hes sending it off to the lab. will the lab deliver a negative or will it likely be under the cutoff limit (1ng/ml)?

This is a really thorough discussion of how it works. 

I had poor results with magnesium oxide pills at rehab, and even expensive pills i bought at home, possibly because the opiate constipation, especially methadone, messed my intestines up over the years. So, I read some alt health sites and made up magnesium oil, a roughly 7 to 1 mixture of epsom salt (aka magnesium sulfate, or you can buy magnesium chloride online) and hot water (ie fully saturated and cannot dissolve anymore), in a coffee mug, and then took a shower with a loofah or nylon scrubber, and then rub the magnesium oil all over, and then do it again. Or, if im busy, ill just use the scrubber on my arms at the sink and then rub it on my arms.

It's amazing. It really is, and cheap as fuck to get epsom salt, especially since used this way a single bag lasts forever.

Re magnesium oil rubs after a shower, It's also a nice, cheap way to do something for your, perhaps, too often not cared for junkie body that is relaxing AND probably helps you get higher! I know it made me feel more human in a few ways, and this past month has been surprisingly easy, highly recommended. ",1539162440.0

I'm a person with ADHD that has had to switch to a different medication recently (Dexedrine) from Vyvanse. I had 0 issues sleeping on Vyvanse and while I have 0 issues getting to sleep on Dexedrine I can't stay asleep to save my life. I woke up around 15 times last night.

Told my doc this and I've been given scripts for both Clonidine and Seroquel. Basically try one see if it works, if it doesn't do the other. 6 tablets max for Clonidine, (It's 0.1 micrograms per tablet I think) and Seroquel is 25mg up to a max of 50mg.

I just did some research and I'm not going to lie folks Clonidine scares the fucking shit out of me and Seroquel looks better the more I read about it. All the side effects I see of Seroquel (weight gain, drowsiness, vivid dreams) don't bother me at all. Especially weight gain as I just started gym and am trying to gain weight. While Seroquel is used as an antispychotic which does scare the shit out of me I've read that at doses of 25-50mg theres not enough for it to ever attach to the receptors to give you any sort of issue with antipsychotic treatment. I'm 100% looking just for a sleeping pill.

As for Clonidine it reduces blood pressure, I don't have high blood pressure (got tested 3 days ago 120/70). I'm not sure how much you need to take of it in order for it to have any sort of big effort on your blood pressure so maybe that dose is completely fine.

I'm just looking for opinions on those of you that have used one or the other in doses around what I've said (I know some people take like 700mg Seroquel which isnt of much use to me) and how it has effected you from a sleeping perspective. I've got the Clonidine right now but I'm thinking of going back to the pharmacy for Seroquel.

I used to take 30's and methadone together as well as any other opiates I could get my hands on and snorted many together and when combining a few mgs of RC benzos that I would order. I know it was stupid to do. I would wake up sick and call in to be late to work quite often because the wd's started getting pretty bad after over the past 2 years of it all and I would go through a gram of 92% T.H.C terp oil every 2 days to fight the sickness when I didn't have anything. Mixing up flualprazolam, clonazolam and diclazepam propylene glycol solutions and making it super strong would have me blacking out and nodding out pretty hard after adding in the opiates. The shit show was, well shitty. I crashed my truck, stole from people even though I had plenty of money and just made an ass out of myself. Do I miss it, yeah sometimes but getting to the point of suicidal ideation because of how bad I felt about myself was my bottom. 

     I give kudos to those of you who can use or take your prescribed meds somewhat responsibly. I used to get prescribed 120 hydro 5's each month and they would be gone in 10-14 days on top of taking oxy 30's, perc 10's sometimes and the methadone. I feel lucky to have survived it all because I probably should have been dead on several occasions. I know my liver thanks me now lol.

So when I tell you this provides relief, I'm not some doc telling you this from the sidelines. I have lived this routine too many times, and this is how I have managed to reduce 70-90% of withdrawals each time I have kicked the habit, making it bearable enough to get through by allowing me to eat and get some sleep in that dreaded first week. I dont know if all of the items are necessary or if it would be just as effective without some of them, but each time I've kicked (at least 20 times, sadly) this is the routine I've used. It is expensive- overall around $300-400 for everything- but I'll mention some alternatives to reduce the cost at the bottom. Let's get started with a list of the things you'll need...

 • Kratom (preferably an extract, specifically OPMS Gold Liquid Vials or The original UEI Kratom or tincture made from it are the three most effective I have come across for opiate relief)

 • Loperamide (Immodium)

 • Xanax 

 • Cannabis

 • Restless legs tablets 

 • Clonidine

 • Unisom

 • Vitamin C/Ascorbic Acid

* Mucinex

 • Food that is easy on the stomach (yogurt, apple sauce, peabut butter, bread, fruit)

The day before you start your kick start taking the Ascorbic acid in high doses. If you're starting your kick in the morning I highly recommend getting up, taking a shit, and getting a really good meal in your belly before the sickness takes a hold of you, youre also going to take more ascorbic acid in high dose and a mucinex. Idk about y'all but when I kick mucus seems to drain from my throat into my belly making me sick, mucinex will help you cough that shit up instead. It's likely the first thing you'll be taking after that is some Xanax when the anxiety starts, so take some Xanax and smoke some pot. If you can't afford these or you are being drug tested or something I recommend as an alternative getting some CBD oil and Valerian root extract instead, they're less expensive but don't work as well. Once you start to really feel sick, take 3-4 loperamide and take some kratom. For the kratom you will need to have enough to get you through at least 5 days, I prefer enough for 7. Each bottle of OPMS will keep you from being really sick for around 6 hours. Once bedtime rolls around you're going to: take Xanax, clonidine, restless legs tablets, kratom, unisom (fuck it i take 3) smoke pot, and meditate. Whether you believe meditation helps or not, just do it. Sit in silence for 5-10 minutes and focus on only your breathing. It gives time for everything to kick in, and for you to calm yourself. Then hit the hay for the night. The next day do the exact same things except you'll be taking kratom when you wake as well. Days 3-4 can be especially rough, I recommend having 3 kratom doses on hand for those days if you can afford it. If this list is too expensive to reduce the cost you can buy plain leaf Kratom which will help, but being honest it doesnt work nearly as well as the OPMS vials or UEI. You can also take Valerian root extract instead of Xanax & Clonidine, but again, it's not as effective. On my life, if you follow this regiment you will be able to DRASTICALLY reduce the effects of opiate withdrawal. If you can only afford a few things from the list the most important things I would say are the kratom, the loperamide, and then either the cannabis or the Xanax depending upon personal preference. I truly hope this is able to help some people, because I know before I figured this routine out I simply could not get through withdrawals. Sending love through the ether to all the addicts out there still suffering, y'all are not alone. Don't let this shit kill you.",1539148006.0

South Florida Fentanyl Presses,"First and foremost I’m sorry I cannot provide any pictures. I would like everyone to know it wouldn’t matter either way because these are all next to impossible to tell, whoever has been pressing them has become an expert. Over the past 3 months or so I have received fake M’s, fake k9, and fake V’s. Coloring for the pills has been spot on, light blueish white for the ms and k9s and the regular electric blue for the Vs. 

In my experiences recently, the only way to tell these apart are 3 fold. 1.) how easy they break, real ones should be hard to break with the fingers and should break cleanly, not crumble into pieces. 2.) once you break them open color should be consistent, in the fakes you can see little white specks spread throughout the pills (these are tiny specks of fent) 3. the taste when you snort them, should have the normal oxy taste to them. The fakes don’t really have a taste and you can tell the drip is different. 

Surprisingly when I licked these pills, they had a normal bitter taste to them making it even harder to tell. I started to use caution when I snorted one normally and was very close to OD’ing. Now when I receive them I do no more then a quarter of a pill to start. After receiving the third set of incredibly faked presses, I’ve switched to perc 10’s and luckily have not yet had any issues. I haven’t physically tested these pills but I assume they are fentanyl or carfentinal. If you’re in the South Florida, just be very careful. I have received fakes from 3 different sources now. This is really sad to see because the only reason I was doing pills was to know what I was getting and to curb my risk of overdose. Be safe all! 

Edit: In case you were wondering, I’ve been a regular user of all of these same pills for a period of 12 years or so. This is why it is very scary to me that they are so hard to tell apart. Unless you are getting them directly from the pharmacy, please be cautious and ease into them. ",1539139458.0

When cutting a bigger one into 2 smaller pieces, some dust was left on the plate, almost nothing. Yet, when I touched this dust it got me high. Wasn't really a big high, but I clearly did felt something - just from touching it. It felt like the last high I had when I snorted a piece, just less intense. also it stopped way faster and it had no ""after-effects"", meaning I didn't really get that warm feeling.

&#x200B;

This confused me, but I wanted to take some more. Now after this ""small high"" went over (just lasted a few seconds/mins) I took one of the pices I got from cutting (snorted) and it had almost no effect whatsoever. Which confused me even more.

It was less than I took last time (but even then I didn't take much), but this whole touching-high-thing got me a bit scared to take too much.

Now after a while I feel a bit dizzy, but not high. Also I'm hearing sounds out of my belly.

Maybe the dust I touched was just some good stuff (or maybe it was fentanyl?) and the piece I snorted was just bad stuff? I don't know. I've no idea about this. I also put pressure on the piece to transform it into dust, rather than sniffing up the piece. (didn't do this last time) Weirdly compared to last time when I felt nothing, this time I did feel it hitting the wall of my nose. 

&#x200B;

I'm just new to this all and I don't know anyone else who is taking opiates so I thought I'll just post it here since you guys probably have more experience and can tell me what you think. I don't wanna annoy you guys with my questions but I simply don't know what to make out of my experiences and how I should react/handle this stuff.

Also Sorry in advance for the wall of text, like I said, I just need to vent. I’m at a place in my life where my current close circle doesn’t truly understand all of this, my parents are sympathetic but tired of what we’re all going thru (I don’t blame them) and I can’t bring myself to dump this on my husband or kids. Definitely not my kids.

I just got home from the viewing for the 3rd close friend in 2 years. (I know that might not be “a lot,” but it hurts like it is) He overdosed this past Thursday night and was unable to be revived. He’d been clean for several years. At each of the last 2 funerals, he said “what’s it going to take for everyone to realize they’re killing themselves and one day it’s gonna be them we’re all looking at in a coffin?” And my heart is just so broken that he was so strong and fought it for SO LONG but it got him too.

I think what hits me the hardest is that these people were real people before their downfall. Beautiful, young, vibrant humans with the world at their feet - having an amazing time just loving life and exploring their talents... and it’s never a story of “started hanging around the wrong crowd” or whatever... it’s always been this core group, and when new people came to join the craziness - they didn’t leave, there weren’t “outsiders,” there were just friends. The guys were always shuffling through whatever bands and the girls went to every show. Break ups and make ups and everything in between. We’d lose touch for a while, then someone would have a party, someone would have an extra ticket to a concert, someone would be off at college and get lonely when their roommate went home for the weekend - a phone call was made and it was like there wasn’t any time passed at all. Like just today walking back out of the viewing, it took my brother-in-law (who was my friend in this same group of friends before he became my brother, actually) and I longer to get out the door than it did to get in the room because we stopped to hug and laugh and cry with just about everyone the whole way to the door. And all the moms were there, and they all hugged each of us so tight, but looked at us like they just saw us yesterday. One mom asked when I was going to have another bonfire at her house so she could get her bowl ready that she made everyone put their keys in. Except we all have this sadness hanging over us now. Because instead of a concert or a bonfire, we’re getting together at each other’s funerals... and our hearts are broken. 

We’ve all grown and evolved, as humans do. Some of us have families, some are in relationships or married, some are single and traveling everywhere they possibly can, some have been to rehab and moved away from home to start a life because that’s what they had to do to stay healthy.  Some of us are home still, clean and healthy and starting again here. Some of us are pretending like it isn’t a problem. Some of us are in denial that ours could be the next funeral we’re all at. 

Looking at one of your best friends of 20+ years laying in a casket from an overdose never gets easier. It gets harder. Every. Single. Time. It’s harder. It’s a different face. It never looks like the friend you love. Because it’s not them, it’s not their soul, it’s not who they are. It can’t be. Every time it happens, I refuse to believe it. They were just doing so well! They were clean for so long! Weren’t they? Wasn’t he? He was fine!! It’s not true! 

But it is. And it’s so morbid and heartbreaking and terrifying that when we’re all eating pizza and having a few beers and laughing about the good times after the funeral.. we’re all secretly wondering... Who’s next?

It just sucks.

Please be safe. Please be healthy. Please don’t be the next funeral. Please. 

Please.",1539131906.0

I think the title will give off a sort of negative impression that I'm against drugs. But I'm an enthusiast on what ever gives you your phix as long as it's used responsibly. I'm more of an uppers type of guy. 

&#x200B;

**Dose**

But I got my hands on some hydrocodone 5mg/325mg acetaminophen.  

&#x200B;

**Experience**

I took 2 just to start me out and see how it goes. These were those good old Watson's. I don't remember the pill imprint, but they had little red dots skewed across the pil as well as watson on the front.  About an hour later, I felt kind of tired and a bit sick. I ended up becoming extremely sick to my stomach.  But I did feel good, like a low wave of pleasureable feelings to my well being. Now, I have to admit that I've been on dependent on stimulants for a while now and was going through a slight withdrawal at the time. So I think my withdrawal could have affected the effects of the Vicodin moderately.  

About 2 hours later, I took 2 more. Totaling up to 20mg hydrocodone/1.3g of acetaminophen. I was feeling extremely itchy on my shoulders and back so hopped in the shower and it felt like R Kelly's golden shower! (Joke). It was really a pleasurable experience that I would like to have again some other day. Later that night, the itching increased and so did feeling sick to my stomach. 

**Pros:**

* Euphoria
* A very pleasurable shower
* Got good sleep
* Relieved some of my personal problems

**Cons:**

* Nodding off
* Very Itchy
* Sick to my stomach (Didn't puke)
* Bad For My Productivity 
* Can't get an erection. 

**Conclusion**

I personally feel like this drug shouldn't be abused/taken for people who have a productive lifestyle. I'm not sure if 20mg of hydrocodone is a strong dose for a first timer. But, 10mg was enough to knock me on my ass for a good/bad experience and 20mg was enough to make me feel out of this world. Getting rid of that sickness feeling, would have possibly gave me an up vote for Vicodin. Please enjoy responsibly. ",1539099323.0

I went to rehab and moved to Florida when I got out to get away from the junkie scene in my home town. But, y’all know how it goes. Always having a little itch in my brain telling me to take a shot. Sooo occasionally, I get too excited over the situation and take a couple perk 5s or smoke some opium about once a year. That settles my cravings for a while and I stop thinking about using....

So I found this sub a couple months ago and it set me OFF. Seeing those shots people post up is better than porn. As my mouth was watering reading this sub, I decided I’d order 2 grams of opium from the web.... so I bought the btc, went to make my order, and what do you know, I’m a couple dollars short if that sweet second gram... now I have some cash sitting on my dnm waiting to be spent... not enough for opium, and I’d hate to buy some weed stuff when I can go to my medical shop and get it in person.... but I have the perfect amount of BTC to buy my favorite thing in the world....

Harm minimisation.","In the interests of harm reduction, I thought it important to clear up some misconceptions that I’ve heard repeated lately regarding Naloxone. 

The vast majority of us know how and when to use it & what needs to happen immediately after. 

But for those of us who are new to opiates, or who aren’t quite sure what it can or can’t do, (or what to expect if we ever have to use it) here is an important run down that could very well save your (or someone else’s) life. 

It’s important to note that if you’re considering using Narcan (naloxone) either as an injection into a muscle, IV or intra-nasally then this is a SHTF or worst case scenario. 

You’ll likely save the person you are about to Narcan’s life, but you may throw them into Precipitated Withdrawals if they’re physically dependent

• Naloxone is an opioid receptor antagonist. That means that when it’s used, it displaces (or kicks your DoC, which is an agonist) off your opioid receptors. 

• If you are OD’ing, this will reverse the OD and the user will generally regain their respiratory drive (start breathing again). 

• Depending on what drug they’ve taken, their tolerance and how they took their dose (orally, IV etc) multiple doses of Naloxone may be needed until the patient regains consciousness. 

• Further doses of Narcan (naloxone) may be administered every few minutes until desired response (consciousness & normal breathing), is obtained. You won’t do any harm by giving them too much naloxone & it’s better to give too much than not enough. 

• It is CRITICAL to understand this next point. Naloxone does NOT “cure” an opioid OD. It’s not like getting bitten by a snake, the doctor gives you the anti-venom and you’re better. 

• Naloxone has a limited duration of action. 
Generally 30 minutes to 1 hour. If the drug you have taken, has a longer duration of action (highly likely) then when the naloxone wears off, the opioids will flock back onto your receptors (getting you high again) and you may very well go back into OD & stop breathing again. 

• This is why it is vital to view Naloxone as something to buy you time to get to hospital or for the paramedics to arrive. It will keep you alive long enough for an ambulance or to get to a hospital. 

• This is the reason that when you OD and get to hospital, best practice is to put you on a Naloxone IV drip (to stop you falling back under again) while we observe you. 

• The *only* way that opioids are eliminated from your body, is by your body metabolising them, breaking them down & you passing them from your system. All the Naloxone does, is temporarily stop opioids reattaching to your receptors. 

• If you REALLY have a beef with hospitals or doctors, and if you have a stash of enough Naloxone, yes it’s possible to dose someone every 30-60 minutes for 12 hours to make sure they don’t fall back into OD again. There’s no difference between your OTC naloxone and the stuff we put in the drip in the ER. 

• People who have been given naloxone will often be confused or combative and not aware that they had overdosed. If this is the case, ensure your own safety and wait for the paramedics to arrive. 

• Do NOT make the mistake of thinking that because the person (or yourself) insists that they feel fine, that they are out of danger. Naloxone simply kicks the opioids off your receptors for an hour or so. They are still there and waiting to reattach and cause you to OD again. Get medical help ASAP. 

• I apologise if this seems overly simplified or paternalistic. But naloxone does not “dissolve” or “cure” an OD. It is a tool to buy you time. 

If you do not have access to Narcan, then you can absolutely save a life. Opioids are not toxic in and of themselves.

 If you can keep the blood pumping and oxygenated by CPR until the professionals arrive, that’s good enough. 

If the person has vomited, place them on their side in the “recovery position” (please Google to see illustrations of the position) & try to clear their mouth of any vomit. 

As an anecdote I have personally seen someone who overdosed, was brought to the ER & placed on Naloxone. This person was angry, but lucid, coherent and totally “with it”. He ripped the IV line from his arm. Against medical advice, he self discharged. 

He thought he was fine. We spent some time treating him for other issues and then he waltzed out of the ER. He was found by police OD’d on the pavement a few hundred metres away. 

He was brought back & placed in a coma while the naloxone drip was restarted. 

His toxicology came back, he had consumed a tremendous amount of methadone (which has a duration of action of approx 24 hours). 

He collapsed because the narcan wore off after approx 30 minutes. 

DON’T let someone you’ve narcanned, refuse medical assistance. If you have to, call the ambulance and leave. You’ll still have saved a life.",1539086063.0

I've completely lost hope that things will improve, and i'm ready to throw my life away.  Any and all advice appreciated.",1539063086.0

But before that I was on a good 2-3 month stretch. Only occasional bouts of coke. I never really planned it until few days prior. I knew I had time, money, and was currently dealing with a  breakup/other external issues. I just needed to fall out of society and go full blown addict. Crystal/H/Coke/Oxy in any order for the whole two weeks. Insane how quickly all the good things you had going can roll down hill if you just let them. 


Also anyone know that feeling of doing drugs with someone that it makes you feel dead inside ? They are such good people who you know have talent and potential and It’s not entertaining watching someone else ruin there life with you. Especially when your around their parents and friends and you have to act like you weren’t smoking meth and snorting dope and coke for the past week straight with them listening when they lie over and over to their faces


Just looking back after a wild binge like that it’s just a blip of my life that I was completely out of touch with anything else in the world besides drug use. Honestly today I had some regrets about it and rightfully so but also what’s the point of doing all that crazy shit and blowing the money if your not gonna enjoy it? I’m cleaned up now just on a rapid taper after the opiates. (which might be more like 18 days straight now) don’t plan on having another rip like that for awhile but as I said earlier I never really do..that’s the thing about it for me. 

I’m just happy that nobody got hurt or anything i didn’t have to steal or rob this time to make it happen. I spent my own money. But still, I can’t keep building myself up just to break myself down. 

Throwaway account..long time lurker.... just decided to post. Really enjoy the love over here guys, plan to be a more active member to this sub in the future.

But i find it absurd that 90% of rehabs are affiliated with 12 step programs and that they say AA is the only way to get sober. First off, i dont want to be ""sober"", i want to live my life without having the obsession of using opiates and benzos. I still plan on using marijuana. 

People in 12 step programs instantly declare you ""not ready"" and say you will relapse. AA is so outdated i cant believe this shit is the most talked about way to stop using drugs. Every single meeting is exactally the same. People sharing the same thing saying you must work the program and get a sponsor blah blah blah. They say straight lies saying if you honestly complete the 12 steps you will stay sober. I know plently of people who took it seriously that have relapsed. Back when i gave AA a try, my sponsor relapsed.

Im currently in a rehab and the whole program is hand outs from 12 step groups and going to meetings at night. I tell everyone i just dont agree with what they say and instantly everyone thinks im going to relapse and think i dont care about getting better or im just ""not ready."" I have been to 12 step rehabs 6 times and it didnt do me any good. Its like giving someone the same medicine 6 times after it keeps not working. 

I have also heard someone say ""I feel empathy for all of you who do not have a sponsor, because YOU WILL DIE! 

They also say it doesnt have to do with god but just look at the 12 steps, it says god like 7 times. And you even say the our father at the end of some meetings. I think ""turning you life over to a higher power"" is bullshit and that we as addicts need to actually make progressive changes about ourselfs and not ""give it to god."" 

And the whole chip thing. Thats not right to make someone who has lets say a year clean, and they relapse to fucking start over and make them feel like a failure. They still got a fucking year clean and can get back to where they were. Making someone annouce how many days they have, i think hurts more than helps. 

Im about to go to a meeting now and im dreading listening to these fucking idiots praise god and talk about how shitty there life is and how much fun it was when they were using. Its like all they remeber is the ""good ol times."" I could go on and on about how much i hate 12 step programs but what do you guys think? I want to know how others feel and if im the only one who sees through the AA nonsense.",1539049158.0

I’ve noticed some shadiness in the past week when her friend comes over. But, she went upstairs and locked the bathroom door to pee. I followed her up and called her out and she’s mad at me. She said this is the first time but, she’s lied to me so many times I can’t believe her. 

I want to be supportive but, every time I give her a chance she messes up right away. She says I’m too controlling with the money but, I’m the only one working and want the bills paid. I thought by letting her be in control of the money she would see that I trust her again. 

She gave me her last two pills and I flushed em. I think I overreacted. I don’t know if those are the last two. I don’t know what to do. I was so proud of what we were accomplishing together, now I feel so alone. She’s the only one that I go to when I’m sad. She’s the only one that makes me happy. I don’t want to live without her but, I’d rather be clean by myself than high with her. ",1539048892.0

This shit is fucking insane..so her sugar daddy is a very old man who has dimenshia and is clinically ill.  He can't keep his finances straight and forgets what is going on with his close family.  On top of that his daughters and even their lawyer has contacted this lady about keeping her hands off his money and stop abusing his old man any further.  But she will not listen and honestly feels she is entitled to his money.  She even told me she hasn't physically seen him in over 2 months.  It's really painful to hear how excited this scummbag is to financially ruin this decent old man.  I read a letter from his family begging her to stop stealing his money, to the point where his grand daughters had to stop going to college because he couldn't afford to support their tuition.  She was bragging that his family switched his credit card numbers but she went through his wallet and wrote down the new numbers.

I just can't believe this toothless lady can sit here smoking $200 worth of crack, and $200 worth of heroin.  In a hotel she charges on his credit card, eats food he pays for.  Then spends all day ordering clothes and other items online with his credit cards.  It would make anyone with half a heart sick to their stomach.  What would you do?
