Anyways I think I've kinda noticed that when I snort my dope instead of smokin my body releases less histamine. 

im just wondering if anyone else has also noticed that snorting dope vs smoking it releases less histamine for them?

also any tips for minimizing the histamine reaction? it makes getting high stealthily very difficult. the only thing ive been doing is taking benedryl which does help a little... but not alot.

The following night I popped 3 initially and waited an hour. I got itchy again and did feel something slightly pleasant. Almost like when you're drinking and you just start to feel the buzz. I ate 2 more, and still nothing. Just itchy.

So the 3rd time was tonight. A friend of mine came up on a bunch of Roxy 30's and he's got a pretty high tolerance I suspect because he ate one and snorted half the other. I stupidly do the same by eating one and snorting his other half. So at this point I'm 45mg in and just ate another half. He's fucking blasted at this point and I'm sitting here slightly itchy and typing this up on my phone, sober as can be, trying to figure out how someone with basically zero tolerance can't catch a buzz with 60mgs of oxycodone.

Good kid but unfortunately substance abuse runs rampant in his family and once he started with the H he lost all control. This is his fourth trip in three years and the feeling is that time's running short for him before he lands in jail or worse. It seems that women always play a big role in his relapses and general fuck-ups, the dude has a gift for getting the girls but he never chooses wisely and always ends up with the real bottom-feeders. I'm not sure what outpatient options he has right now, just hoping he finds something...anything...to fill the void the drugs left in his life. He always goes overboard with everything, whether it's weed, pills, H, whatever (although he's somehow managed to avoid booze which has long been his family's real bugaboo). A few years back I tried to explain how he has a genetic predisposition toward substance abuse, I've known that family for a long time and it's taken a frightening toll on them all...prison, brain damage, disfigurement, amputations, it's horrific. It never really got through to him though.  

Anyhow I'm just pulling for him as always, as well as anyone else who's struggling too. I really wish there was some sort of magical elixir or secret ""words of wisdom"" I could share with him. I sometimes feel like a hypocrite seeing how I do enjoy my daily buzz and all but for some people it's just different and darker.

I haven't been in the game for that long (3 years) but even when I started I knew to watch out for fentanyl and that it was a problem in the opiate community (at least where I'm from - Ontario). Then all of a sudden in mid to late 2014, the news stories started coming out and every major bust involved fentanyl. Now I can't go a block without reading or hearing something about fentanyl and how bad it is in North America. Is it really worse than it's ever been or is it simply the first time there has been significant media attention on this, probably due to opiates becoming more ""mainstream"" in general due to the Oxy explosion?

Sorry if it's a dumb question, I'm genuinely curious. There was a short period of time in my area where it seemed like the dope/fent wasn't appropriately measured so there was an uprise of overdoses, but the problem seems to have passed for now.

As I mentioned earlier, I generally use to function and enjoy the high, not sleep through it, so I don't nod or pass out or whatever regularly. Ultimately, if that is pushing it, I will NEVER take an intentional dose that is just a bit larger than usual as I sometimes may after a frustrating day or whatever. Bad day, angry or fruatrated...get fuckin faded right!   

Tl;Dr  -  Is nodding for 15-20 minutes dangerously close or just ""harmless"" fun? 

If all of this made no sense, please let me know and I will attempt to clarify and be concise. ",1475272484.0

after I fix up. After I had some silly citizen call in a welfare check on me this spring for no reason I have gotten a lot more cautious.   
Since I frequently fix up in the bathroom of a fast food place I usually try to get something. Of all the places though, I gotta say that the Wendy's Baconator tastes so god damn good after a shot I thought I could sat that its my favorite with a strawberry lemonade. Sonic used to be good and McDonalds doesn't really taste much different after getting high. That Baconator though man, seems to transform into something amazing after a good shot. I haven't tried it but I imagine the Pizza hut lunch buffet would be pretty amazing as well. This post has carried on way too long given the simple question but, whatever.

I've been trying to quit opiates for some time now, and the only thing that has been bugging me *isn't* the fact that it would feel ""so good"" to do opiates again, but rather, that I might never feel as good as I did before opiates, due to tolerance and brain changes. This is the only thing that has ever made me want to use after quitting. I would want to try it ""one last time"" to see what ""normal"" felt like. Even though, of course, ""normal"" is probably above normal, due to the nature of opiates.

What if... I use an antagonist like Naltrexone to try to at least partially reverse the tolerance that has developed in my brain? I understand that Naltrexone is extremely painful (due to the accompanying withdrawal symptoms, even in opiate-naive individuals), which is why I'd be using it in somewhat low dosages.

Basically, the idea is to go through all of the withdrawal symptoms, both acute and PAWS, in a very short amount of time.

Do you think this might work?

Edit: I've decided I'm going to try it. Just ordered some Naltrexone. I'll dose it at night along with something to help me sleep (probably ambien) and hope for the best. I'm so desperate to get my life back in order. I'll update this sometime down the line to say whether it worked or not.",1475260049.0

We were doing so bad on money that I ended up quitting my job on Friday (commission job that hasn't had any work for me basically the past 2 months) I ended up hooking up with a buddy last week that I used to work with and he started his own business earlier this year and they are booming, so much that he offered me a job on the spot when I visited his office and wrote me a nice sized check to help me make the switch, so needless to say we got caught up on our bills and got ourselves plenty of stuff to have a nice weekend! Even after spending all that we still had a nice chunk of change left over so we checked out the local scene last night to see if any good bands or whatever were in town and ended up buying 2 tickets to see a really funny comic doing standup downtown tonight! I'm pretty stoked about it because I've never seen a standup show before and I got us a couple triple stacks (rolls) to take before the show so it's gonna be a blast, can't wait for tonight and praise Junkie Jesus for looking out for me and my family and allowing us to get back on our feet after this rough couple of months we've had! She got laid off her old job at the same time my work started slowing down and just started this new job as well so I'm feeling very thankful for both of us finding new work instead of falling flat on our faces. Not to mention the lift on the kratom ban means I'm also gonna put in an order for some of that too, which reminds me does anyone here have any suggestions of strains that can help with withdrawals and pain relief? I've only ever gotten overpriced junk shit from head shops around where I live. Anyways how was everyone's weekend and are you guys doing anything fun or exciting today? I'm sure most people are still asleep right now but looking forward to getting some replies later on. Hopefully at the least everybody gets to sleep in and watch football with their DOC. 

By the way, I've never smoked blues before but I've smoked tar, would it be a waste for me to smoke one of my M's? I've always wanted to try it and I've heard that M's are the best to smoke but would I just be wasting it if I do that?

I'll spare you all the details? Other than I've decided October 5th will be my last day of using opiates, one dose in the morning.  There's a reason I picked that day but it doesn't really matter and I'm sure none of you care.

The point of this post is that if any of you are thinking about quitting, or know financially you will not be able to get drugs on that day, or whatever the case, I welcome any of you physically addicted to quit with me.  We can chat on whatsapp or Skype or whatever and generally just talk to each other and be each other's support systems, since as many of you know, family just doesn't understand.  They may love you and may want the best for you and some may have even done a little research, but only a true addict can relate to the sickness and the psychological depression and everything else.  Fuck who knows, maybe even a group of us can do it or something.

To make you feel better, know that I'll be jumping off an average of 800-1200mg of oral oxycodone daily.  I'm one of the lucky souls who experiences every symptom there is, to its fullest effect, and I'm typically sick for a good 10 days physically.  I'll spare you all the reasons I'm quitting and just say I've decided that I want my life back, and I don't want to be dependant on opiates for the rest of my life.   I want to be happy again.  I want to fuck bitches again. I want to have emotion and not feel trapped in apathy and depression and anhedonia.

Anyway if any of you were thinking about quitting any time soon, you're welcome to join me so we can experience hell together.  Send me a PM if you're interested and we'll figure out how best to keep in touch.  If there are several people interested maybe we can do a group chat on Skype or whatsapp.  Anyway we can figure out the logistics later.

To the rest of you, stay safe.  It's been a fun ride, but the fun is over and now it's time to pay the piper.

Cheers =)

PS - I'm also going to keep a personal journal of my withdrawal timeline to look back on in case I ever get the urge to use in the future.  It's amazing how quickly we forget the hell of withdrawal and our lizard brains take control.",1475399140.0

I am 17 years old and I don't want to become an addict. I read your stories- both good and bad, to convince myself that these meds aren't worth it. 
     As I said I'm 17 and for two years I've had back issues however the last 6 months are a steady exponential increase in pain; I'm currently at the point that I can no longer function due to the pain. I used to play sports, work, school, trade school, family, friends, everything. Now I lay around. I've smoked weed before and I've used a few oxys before (illicit) and had a 5/325 Vicodin script (legal).
     Of course the pain meds work, that's not what I'm scared of. It's that a large number of addicts start with a real script and I don't want to do that. I know myself and that I enjoy the pills too much to not abuse them. I keep telling my parents to go the legal medical marijuana route but they say the pills are fine. How to I convince them they aren't?!?! I'm a senior, going to college, Welding school, and a girl I love (too cheesy ;) ) and I know that if I take too many pills I'm going to piss my life away. 
     Sorry for the wall of text, I just want to vent and get feedback on my thinking. If pain management is vital, and via a drug, is it not a better option to use Med Mar??? Hope everyone's Saturday has been chillin, and I also like all the recent drawings of everyone :) peace. ",1475363283.0

I know sniffing the tens is bad news as is all the APAP I'm taking but when it's all I can find I'm not really worried about that at the time.

I've only been using BTH for about 10 months and about twice as many times, as I used more frequently in the beginning of my chipping experience. I use subs (about 4mg a day) throughout the month, so my tolerance goes down quite a bit by the time I get around to using again. Typically, the first day or two of the weekend (okay, a long 4-day weekend) I nod pretty hard. I always start small (I plug), but inevitably I nod (that's kinda the point of my splurging). Anyway. Of course I'm scared shitless about the fent ODs going around, but I honestly don't know much about BTH other than the documentaries I've seen, which are outdated in terms of the current situation with Cfent.

I'm wondering about this because my tolerance is absurdly high that it's becoming impossible to nod out like I used to be able to, as I usually end up getting a body buzz + euphoria and then fall asleep. 


It should be noted that for about two years now I've switched from the spike to snorting. My life was completely out of control when I was shooting and I have zero desire to return to that, therefor gong back is not an option. After the first few months it was tough to nod again, but then it wasn't so hard.. Not economical at all, as it can take a bun to do so, but whatever.. Apathy is good on these rare occasions.


The only thing that has worked recently is getting my hands on some lean and mixing sipping it with lines of dope, (however I don't have a connect for lean.. I just ""borrow"" some of my sisters excess that she hasn't used in almost a year, but there's limited amounts left of that, so I need to find alternatives). 


Is there anything out there that can enhance the affects of the ECP I am getting? (Non-prescribed medication, preferably). I've heard about various juice drinks and some other questionable possibilities and I need your expertise.. google can't help me like you all can.


I do get benzos, but not even they help with the nod.. just more of a body buzz. Thanks for reading, and sorry if it was long. Just desperate to find something that may help; even a different ROA. Plugging never really worked for me either for some unknown reason, and smoking it uses too much with these tiny jersey stamps.


Thanks to any and all that can help! Much love, and nod on! (Luckyyy)! :)",1475347362.0

He got 2 scripts of percocet, for a total of ~200 pills. He has no tolerance and doesn't abuse them so he'd take like 2 or 3 a day at most, and he had a LOT left. 

He is my best friend's roommate. He's the kind of guy that doesn't do anyone a favor unless he's gaining something. He gives you a ride, he wants cash. He mows your lawn, he wants cash. Despite the fact that I helped him get a job and helped him find a home for his bulldog when he couldn't afford her anymore. I've done him a lot of favors just because if I am able to help someone, I do...

Anyway, the other day I asked him if I could buy some percocets from him. He said no. He said he didn't have many left and wasn't willing to share. Then my best friend stepped in and convinced him. He said he would let go of 3 for 15 dollars. 3 fucking pills? AT A TAXED PRICE, FUCK YOU! I ended up getting 10 for 45. Not a good deal, but I was really needing something. But when I went into his room, I saw where he keeps them, and he had a FULL fucking bottle. I mean this bottle had easily 120+ percs in it. He rarely takes them. It looked like a whole script that he never even touched.

I really want to steal some from him. I know that's evil, but he pissed me off. Why doesn't he want to share them and make some money? It's not like he's being greedy with them because he abuses them. Those bitches are gonna sit in that bottle and slowly expire. He got the surgery in January, btw.

•Starting using dope (exclusively IV) December 2015. 
•Stopped using completely by May 2016. 

So, I've been off dope, with no problems for roughly 5 months now. It's not as big a deal to me as it is to everyone else. Actually, I miss it. Not just the drug though. The whole experience. None of which was positive, but it was so *fun.*

It was me, my former best friend and her husband. The three of us would rip stores off by finding old receipts and returning the shit on them. We made a good $100 just from Walmart alone every day. It was so fucking easy to do, there being 3 of us working together. Even if that was all we made that day, it was enough to split until we went back out the next day.

Then, riding out to get it was something amazing in itself. The anticipation, the gratification picking up, taking the shot before we left the city, then feeling amazing all the way home. The ritual of cooking it up, having the motions down in no time. I actually felt good at it? Efficient, I guess is the word I'm looking for.

And then there's the needle fetish. That's what I think about the most. After I stopped, I completely cleaned out my stash spots, broke my rigs, everything. I had no problem with it. I still dont, I dont think. But I constantly have dreams about finding rigs in my room. In the dream, I go to uncap it, but wake up before I see the actual needle. Every time. Then I spend the entire morning thinking about what the flash looked like in the needle once it finally registered. I miss that the most, besides the rush obviously.

There are other reasons why I miss it, as I have chronic pain and it was the first and only thing that has ever completely taken it away. I used to get prescriptions for Norco but dropped dirty (surprise!) and was dismissed as a patient. 
I still buy Norco off friends and family who have scripts any time I can.

The thing that gets me the most, is the knowledge that I could very easily start using again and no one would notice. No one did last time. I never nod out and I've never gotten WDs, with any drug at all. I only got found out because my friend left a rig in my car, my mom was rummaging through the car and found it. That was that, I detoxed for a week (more of a show than anything to placate my mom), and cut contact with them. 

But that last part leaves so much room for me to wonder, and I know if I ever got my hands on any again, I'd be at Walgreens 5 minutes later buying a pack of rigs. It's really messing with me but I don't feel like I can. Talk to anyone. I tried therapy and it just didn't feel right.

I work in a homeless shelter. I come into contact with tons of different kinds of people, and often- due to the complete lack of organization within my agency- I have no idea who I'm dealing with unless they choose to confide in me. 

Tonight a couple clients were hanging out in the lobby and we got into a long conversation about a lot of different things. 

The woman had only been there about a week. I did her intake and have been wracking my brain trying to remember where I know her from, because I knew her from somewhere. 

Turns out she was a nurse at the rehab I went to 5 years ago. 

The guy in the conversation was so nice and sweet and smart and thoughtful, and we talked about the homeless recidivism rate, addiction in the homeless population, and how strange technology is nowadays. Because he had ""been away"" for 17 years and I had to show him how to use certain functions on his phone. 

Turns out, He just was released from prison after 17 years after having had molested multiple 10 year old girls. 

There's really no point to this post except that homelessness AND addiction make strange bedfellows, and that it is always worth getting someone's story even if you think their actions are reprehensible.

Unfortunately, the past month I've started to have constant runny/clogged nose. I've started to use a saline spray after each use and a neti pot a couple of times a week. But, I literally never get anything out after each rinse. Last week, I bought one of those battery powered netti pots that push more water up there and have started to see very small results. But, not nearly enough is coming out to really feel like any progress.

One option is to go to my doctor, but I don't want them to mark my file about abusing drugs since I really do need to script. I'm assuming that once he looks up my nose he will immediately new able to see that it's because of snorting drugs. So, lying to him about the cause is probably not a good idea?

I'm pretty young still (just turned 22), sober, and I'm having trouble trying to get my life back on track and really trying to find out what I'd like to do with my life. As of now, I'm still looking for just a short term, maybe a year or two, entry level job to make a decent amount of money to save up while I figure out everything else I'd like to do. School, career, etc...

   I'm getting to a point where I'm realizing I really need to figure this out, and figure out how I'm actually going to make my money. Time's gonna keep going regardless, and I'd like to be in a better position financially then I am now... Being a dope addict, I've realized how important happiness is, and really how pointless money is when it comes down to it. When you're pawning all of your possessions for dope, you kind of realize that those items don't mean as much as you originally thought. You don't **need** those things. And being majorly depressed and suicidal, you realize how important happiness is. With that said, happiness is more important than money to me, however money definitely plays a roll in happiness. I think we all know that. But still, I'd much rather be happy with a low paying job/career than unhappy with a high paying job/career.

   So, I'm coming to you guys to hear your ideas on what careers and jobs are the best for addicts. Preferably one that doesn't have a drug scene. I know some of y'all are clean, some chip, and some still use. Whatever you do, I'd like to hear your ideas! As opiate addicts, I feel we have a lot in common mentally on how we feel and how we function, so I'm sure this is the place to ask about what jobs are best for us, and what jobs y'all have found the most satisfaction in! SO if you can help out, that would be much appreciated. Thanks guys!

I sniffed like ten bags, thought I felt them for a minute but then it went away.  I didn't really feel them.  

Right now I feel kind of dope sick but not completely awful.  Like the bit of precipitated withdrawals I put myself through is over, my body is not well, but the subs are working a little bit.

The question is can I take subs tonight or in the morning and not have to worry about precipitated withdrawal because I had taken that sub before I used the dope today and didn't really feel the dope?  Or would I have to wait a 24-30 hour time period to take more subs to be safe?  (Which isn't happening). I'd just use dope for the week and then try to get on the subs again fresh next weekend.

Took 60mg oxy a couple hours ago and just took about 100mg nucynta and it's pretty fucking nice, I must say. The nucynta adds a nodding/sleepiness to the oxy that oxy doesn't have on it's own.

I have been using opiates for many years now (about 5-6 in total) I'm not really one with much self control and usually find myself splurging and doing the majority of my pickup right when I get it instead of spacing it out. The pat few months I've shyd away from dope because recently EVERYTHING I have been sold im certain has fent in it or is legit fent only and has no h even.......

So what has that made me do.... I've switched to mainly doing opana g series the g74 orange 40s as many of you know these are pretty strong as compared to other pills on the market. Well last weekend my dealer was completely out and I was getting my wisdom teeth out (what great timing) so I was detoxing off a 1-2 opana a day habit well I decided I couldn't wait any longer and bought a bunch of roxy 30s. I was able to space the roxys out for the days following my surgery as I new I actually needed them for pain management as well as they were holding off the terrible opana withdrawals that are usually pretty damn unbearable.

Well I eventually ran out of 30s 3-4 days after my surgery. I then and only then looked at the bottle of narcos (7.5/325) that they prescribed me. I popped two of them and made a plan use these to fight off my withdrawals further. Well after two days I used the entire bottle (I know way to much apap but whenever I CwE in the pst I apparently super fuck it up cuz I never feel a thing) so what happened the next was crazy!

I woke up wanting more opiates like every other day but not to the point were I was in any major discomfort or any terrible withdrawals. I have quit opana and h cold turkey (for short amounts of time like a few days :/) and know what withdrawing is like.

Has anyone else ever experienced something like this??? People always ask ""how can I make my withdrawals bearable"" many even have access to DNM and other things. Like I said I am terrible at controlling how much I take and always take too much initially but this time I forced myself to taper because of the surgery and wanting atleast some relief. 

TLDR: has anyone ever tapered off a stronger opiate with weaker opiate (Opana-->oxy-->hydros ) or anything similar? I was surprised at how well this worked.


Obviously it didn't not make me not an addict and am planning on getting more opana in a day or two

I want to get the most I can out of these!

I have heard antihistamines potentiate opiates so how much of the promethezine should I take?

Also I have heard that small amounts of DXM will also potentiate Opiates, I am unsure of how much truth there is in this and would love your input.  If it does work, what dose should I take?

Also!  I am not okay with snorting at all, but I am okay with plugging.  Would crushing the pills up into a very fine powder and using an oral syringe to shoot it up my shitter work better than oral?  I hear oral bio availability is quite high but I am wondering if the high would be percevied as stronger?

I want to tell a story that happened the other day. It has no point to it and I'm not posting it for any particular reason. I'm not even sure why I want to tell it, but I do.

This happened a few days ago. Thursday before last I stopped taking buprenorphine and decided to get high. I'd planned for it to be a one time just-this-weekend kind of thing, but you know how it goes. So after getting high and missing my pharmacy pick-ups my script was canceled. I missed an appointment with my key worker and decided to just get high this week and sort it all out next week.

So I started smoking heroin. Either the heroin I have been getting is weak or I underestimated my tolerance, but I was not getting as high as I'd have liked with as little as I'd liked. ""I know"" I thought to myself, ""I'll buy some safe injecting kits, just to stretch my money until I get back on my prescription"". So I bought two 5-injection kits from a harm reduction company. The kits came with needles, syringes, acid to dissolve the heroin (UK), and little cups to boil the liquid, alcohol wipes and a filter. Everything I needed.

When the kits came with a bag of dope I got from the darknet, I opened them up after smoking some dope to feel ok. After assembling one of the needles and putting it to my skin my fear of needles immediately said ""fuck that"", and I put away the kits, minus the syringe and needle I had opened and assembled. And that was that I thought, I won't start IV'ing, stupid idea, don't do stupid things you stupid fuck.

The heroin I'd bought disappeared much more quickly than I'd hoped, and I was left with none after only a day or so. I'd been keeping the bag in a tin, and there was dope-dust all in the tin, and some in the bag. I just wanted to get high, smoking wasn't doing much for me, so I figured I would use some slightly acidic water to dissolve the dust in the tin and bag and inject it. The water worked quite well, and the solution I was left with (after boiling it and filtering it) was slightly brown. There was also too much of it, about 2.5ml almost the whole of the syringe. ""Oh well, it'll make it easier to inject it slowly and in parts rather than all at once"" I figured, planning to change the needles between vein-pokes.

So there I was. A syringe full of slightly dopiated water in my hand. I'd never IV'ed anything before. I was scared. I wanted to get high. I was afraid of infection, or missing a vein, and anything else my mind could conjure up. I could feel my heart thumping and my mind was rapidly alternating between worse case scenarios and the excitement of getting high.

Looking on my arm my veins were somewhat hard to see. I used an old thin jumper and tied it around just above my elbow. Flexing my hand my veins started to become more prominent. There was a lovely big one in the crook of my arm. ""What if you miss, what if it gets infected?"" I looked further down and saw a prominent one on the side of my forearm. There it was.

My syringe primed, I put it to the skin. My heart rate increased. I wasn't excited anymore, I was just scared. Still, I thought, just put it in and inject, that's all it takes and you'll get high, hopefully anyway. I tried a few times to push into the vein. It's tricky, skin isn't as penetrable as I'd thought, it bends and resists the metal you're trying to force through. After a few times, I felt the sharp pain and the violation of the needle slowly force itself through my skin and into my bloodstream. My breathing had become laboured, and struggling to keep my hand steady I awkwardly and slowly rearranged the needle in my hand such that I could slightly pull the plunger out. The small rush of blood into the syringe surprised me for some reason. The slightly brown liquid that was in the syringe was replaced by a a darker colour and swirls of dark blood. Wasting no time I pushed the plunger in slightly, slowly, and saw the vein expand. 

There was no rush of eurphoria or moment of bliss. I didn't suddenly understand Renton's train spotting speech, or find something I'd been looking for my entire life. Nope, none of that. I freaked the fuck out and pulled the needle out. Fuck. That. Shit.

It took me a while to calm down and my breathing to slow. I'd only injected perhaps 10% of the now gross looking liquid inside the syringe. The injection (lol) site had become swollen, and I was worried the worst had happened. It's since gone down, and I don't seem to have done any damage.

And that's my story :D It' one of stupidity, fear, and cowardice. But I guess it has a good ending :) Call me a pussy, I won't disagree with you, but, hey, if I'm not gonna listen to warnings, at least my cowardice might keep me safe.

I don't know why I'm telling this story. I'm not looking for praise or pity, just wanted to share the experience, after reading a post on here by someone who shot up for the first time recently. I also wanted to share how surprisingly horrible the whole experience was. I have a fear of needles so it's to be expected I guess, but even so, as an act, forcing your skin open to deposit drugs into the bloodstream... it's a desperate and damaging act. It's self harm. I have no judgments for IV users, only sympathy and a desire for them to find something, whether inside or outside of their being, that may help them stop hurting themselves. ",1475583636.0

At least let me find the healthiest way of doing things. I remember back in the day we would buy nickel bags of crap, half of it was seeds and stems, and we'd smoke joints all day. To this day I wonder about what chemicals may be used on giant fields in Mexico. Eventually we learned about better quality product, and the marvels of a water pipe (science!). Anyone who's poured out that brown gooey bong water can see what would have gone into our lungs. 

I eventually became fascinated with edibles, tinctures, extracts, vaping.....

In my nearly 30 years of opiates use, I find myself being most intrigued by poppy tea. From the moment I did research I was fascinated by the whole thing. ""Natural"", affordable, very long lasting, in many ways safer, more predictable. And, following my penchant for science, I've been experimenting with methods, product, reductions, second washes, drying extracts. Fascinating stuff. There are obvious and not so obvious downsides too. Most of them are inherent to the actual taking of opiates (duh), but tea offers a few unique issues to be careful of. However, I think it can also be very helpful for many people. As an alternative, as a weening mechanism, for harm reduction, etc, etc. For me, I have found it helpful in a variety of ways, and it's been quite good.

I've gotten high off Tramadol less than 10 times in the last 3 months. I'm a 54kg female, quite tall and slender. 

I usually take a 150mg - 200mg initial dose and then sometimes follow up with a 100mg - 150mg top up 3 - 4 hours later. I love this high, absolutely love it but I vomit every single time. 

I always take my Tramadol with food, don't drink alcohol and keep myself hydrated throughout the day. Sometimes I feel bad right through to the next day even though I don't take anything further. Before I moved I had weed available which helped but at the moment that's not an option. I've also tried strong anti-nausea like ondansetron and still manage to throw up...

But wait! The Girl With A Car needs to pick up too! So, I have her come to my place, get in the driver's seat, pick up another customer and the three of us cheerfully set off to score. Along the way, TGWAC mentions that she needs to make a detour into the city to pick up some strips she left with a guy. We pass the guy's exit on the way to dgirl's place, but TGWAC says we can just stop on our way out.

After we pull up to the shady motel dgirl is staying at, I collect money from my two compatriots and venture in to do business, only to discover that dgirl is on her way out the door to reup. This is fine, it's normally only a 20-30 minute process. So, I walk back out to the car to suggest to TGWAC that she use this time to go grab her strips. She doesn't want to, and instead asks if she and Customer can chill in the room while we wait. I agree, and thus we wait. 

We wait a while, then dgirl returns and loot is parceled out, shots are done, jokes are told, and a good time is had by all. However, as it is getting late, I decide it's about time we head out. This is when TGWAC decides to finally call dude with the strips. He had apparently been waiting on her all afternoon /evening, and had finally left to go chill with some buddies in a suburb a fair distance away.  He says he will be home in 30 minutes. This reeks of bullshit and lies, and I'm ready to get home to the wife. I mention these facts to TGWAC. This is when I learn several key facts - strip guy is also meth guy, and TGWAC has been up for a few days. I learn the latter bit because she insists on taking over driving duties. Excellent. 

To kill time while we wait, she wants to go to a Denny's where she thinks her phone was stolen a couple of days ago. On the way, she spices things up by stopping at a green light (in the middle of the intersection, naturally) before gracefully gliding to a halt double parked across a handicap spot and a no parking zone. While she goes in to 'check the lost and found', I slip into the driver's seat and move us to an area of the parking lot more appropriate for people who have just picked up schedule 1 drugs. 

After about ten minutes of waiting, I send Customer in to retrieve TGWAC. Apparently she had been splitting her time inside roughly equally between rooting through trash cans, accusing minority Denny's staff of stealing her phone, and grabbing random phones off counters and tables to 'check them'.  Fantastic. Customer gets her outside, where she tells me she wants to drive and go to MethStrip Man's house. I tell her that her driving has freaked me out, but that I'll take her to dude's house (some 15 miles in the opposite direction of home). This is a lie. I proceed to start the car and drive us directly home, somehow in the process convincing her that this was the plan all along.

My life has been on a slow decline into an inevitable rock bottom for about 6 months now, and I feel like I have finally reached that point again.  I don't understand why I always seem to live in this cycle of fucking things up, working incredibly hard to rebuild my life and regain trust of those around me, to completely destroying everything with a few bad decisions.  

Things with my girl have been unstable since day 1.  I had recently moved across the country to a place where I only knew one person, of which I could only count on so much.  The job I had lined up prior to moving here fell through when I got here, and finding a job proved a lot more difficult than I could have imagined.  I ended up on the streets and working two jobs for a few months until I managed to save up and get a room in a shared house.  Lived there and continued doing my thing of working and going home for a few months until I met my girlfriend.

She came over for our first date and I made her dinner and she stayed over.  And stayed over every night after that.  It's been a year and one month.  The first few months were insanely pationate.  Something I have never even come close to experiencing.  By the time her true colors started to show, I was so sucked in and hypnotized that no matter how hard the people around me tried to tell me I was not thinking clearly, I wouldn't leave.  By the time 6 months rolled around, physical and emotional abuse became a pretty normal thing in my home and I started slipping into the heaviest dpression of my life.  

I have a long history with drugs, with heroin being my drug of choice.  Before getting into this relationship, I had over a year clean from heroin, but I still drank sometimes and smoked weed pretty regularly.  By the time things got really bad (her pulling a knife on me repeatedly, being hit over the head and knocked out cold), I got hurt at work and started seeing a doctor who right off the bat Rx'd me 10mg hydro's.  With my tolerance being so low, I was able to make them last a few weeks and still catch a buzz most days.

As the story goes, my tolerance started rising, as did my level of misery at home and with myself.  Pretty soon, I was selling most of them and soon found myself a few middle men for tar.  The last 3 months have been a huge binge, which has come all crashing down this weekend.  Thursday night, she got angry about something and next thing I knew I was waking up face first on the kitchen floor with her laughing.  I got up, packed my shit, and went to a friends.  We have separate bank accounts, but we have a shared one which we use for paying bills.  I withdrew every cent (over $900) over the course of a few days, and tried to commit suicide by shooting over 3.5grams and eating over 10mg of xanax over those few days.  I can't even manage to do that right, clearly, because I somehow ended up just sleeping for over two days and woke up with severe memory loss.

Now I am broke and everything is in shambles.  Apparently I quit both of my jobs over the weekend as well.   All I have ever wanted is love and peace and I have never found that in my family and I will never find it anywhere.  I have always felt like there is something off or wrong with me that causes people to hate me but because I'll never know what it is, I'll never be able to fix it.  This life just feels like one long punishment.  Like a jail sentence.  Please help me feel like there are brighter horizons or something guys.  I've lurked this board for a long time because you guys are so supportive of each other and can be so uplifting and it makes me feel less alone knowing there are other people who suffer from this curse of addiction.

Sup r/opiates. I'm a curious new lurker,  first time poster, and a user of oxy for the last 2 years on and off (mostly on). Kratom has helped me so much in times of sobriety (wether I had a choice in sobering up or not); granted, I was borderline forming a need/""addiction"" to having it daily or else I still felt sick and the pain was almost unbearable.. But that's just my lame addictive personality, and my tolerance had become pretty high right before my Dboy ran out for about a month. 
Through that entire month using Kratom just about every day (and not very much if I may add), I reached the end of that 4-5 weeks feeling like it was possible I might not ever pick up again.. But of course one day my phone rang and it was football season once again.. You can guess how the rest of the story goes. 
Bottom line is If it can help people overcome opiate, and apparently even alcohol addiction, then why make it illegal?! Weed is finally becoming legalized in a handful of states (I'm from bc, canada where the, still illegal, good good is at) so why does yet another plant need to become illegal that has proven to help people! 
Silly little rant, but as a fairly self-aware person who has acknowledged their many flaws, I can honestly say that the Kratom was the only thing that got me out of bed and bike to work everyday and back to just ""being"" for that entire month of what started in w/d, and ended in hope..

I can't find any good answers on Google, so I wanted to ask the experts. He did the shot (speedball - crack/heroin/citric acid) on Saturday night. By Sunday morning, a lump had formed and has grown a bit since then. He says he thinks he missed some or all of the shot through the back of the vein. When I poke around, it feels like a golf-ball-sized hard-ish lump behind the muscle. It is warm to the touch and a little pink. He says it only hurts when you push/massage it. He wants to go the ER if it's necessary, but he's deathly afraid of hospitals, so we want to avoid it if it can be treated at home. He thinks it will go away on its own, but my gut is screaming ER. Opinions?

yesterday he was napping and i was sick. ive been using since january with brief periods of sobriety and hope for a clean life but up to now ive lacked the mental fortitude and drive to succeed. anyhow, he was napping and i borrowed his car to go cop. i returned an hour later to find that he had called the cops and that they were on their way. i did what any self respecting junkie would do, mixed up a five bag shot and put the others in the jail wallet. i was preparing for the worst. so im about to bang the shot i'd mixed up and the cops arrive. they come right upstairs and i panic. i have the bat-cap from my rig with the shot all ready to go. i run to the bathroom with it after stashing my point under the mattress. in the middle of all this theyre yelling at me as theyre coming up the stairs. so im in the bathroom and i throw back the shot, and throw the batcap in the trash. immediately pull my pants down and pretend to take a shit. the cops are standing there watching me and i managed to pull the remainder of a bun out of my pocket (which i had wrapped up) and put it in my ass incase i spend the night in the slammer.

anyway, i ended up getting out, no charges were filed. i was just handcuffed to a bench for about six hours. so i did the rest of my bun last night to combat the bitching from my parents about how im going to die, my life is headed nowhere, im a good for nothing junkie, etc. etc. i wake up this morning sick as a dog with no plan. i cant take the car. im broke. im fucked, essentially. so i was sitting here wondering how i used for four years consecutively in this house and hadnt misplaced a thing. i was looking for long lost stashes, or anything that could help me. and thats when i thought of it.

i went in the trash in the bathroom and pulled out the batcap that i had mixed up a five bagger in when the cops came in. although i thought i drank the water there was a brown sludge at the bottom. it was at that moment i knew i was saved.

so after having pulled that up and put it in my arm, im feeling exponentially more optimistic about the future. at least im high for now. 

i know this post sounds incredibly cavalier and stupid but i absolutely realize that i have a problem. i hate this chaos in my life and myself for letting this happen again. ive lost everything i care about. again. so a word to the wise- if youre reading this and you can get out, get out now. there are no success stories. junk will ruin your fucking life.",1475523439.0

**IMPORTANT UPDATE QUESTION**: Is there anything that can help me shake this dissociated feeling?

Other things I've been looking in to were drugs like clonidine or low dose benzos.

Today an IV heroin user was hospitalized with severe pneumonia.
Today that user lied about their drug use, and still even when the toxicology report came back with a cornucopia of drugs. The Dr. decided after you declined Subs to give you morphine to help your cough and even then a particularly generous dose because they personally don't believe in making you sick,
 because they cared.
You complained that it wasn't enough to the nurses til you managed to piss off the nurses enough to chase the Dr. down in the middle of another medical emergency on what to do. 
When they finished with the patient they were seeing they immediately came back, reassessed your pain and added not only more morphine but immediate benzo IV push to help with your anxiety. 
Because they cared.
You fell asleep after the benzo and antibiotics were being hung,  while you are now on your way to becoming stabilized both from staving off withdrawals and hopefully getting over your Pneumonia, but  while you were asleep what you didn't know is that the very same Dr. came by to check in on you because they were worried that you might be septic. 
They thought about you from the moment they left the hospital all the way on their drive home til the very moment they got in the door and worried some more.

I know we hear time and time again about some medical professionals treating people with addictions poorly. 
Please know there are people on the front lines of the heroin laced fentanyl crisis who care so much about you, they don't judge you,hell they realize you've got bigger demons the moment they heard the words from your lips ""I use heroin."" . 
I just figured /r/opiates could use the knowledge that there are people that care out there.

I've inducted hundreds of times but it's been years since I went over 3 weeks  with cycling off. Any comments or help with be much appreciated. 

My last shot was a .2 at 5pm tonight. I have a plethora of adderall, gabapentin, wellbutrin and suboxone to detox with, unfortunately no benzos. 

I have shit to do tomorrow and really don't want to wake up tomorrow at 9am and have to battle withdrawals and want to minimize paid as much as possible. I gotta be out of bed by 10am. That's 17 hours and I'll be in very mild withdrawals. I plan on banging addies and swallowing a couple wellies for the energy to get thru the day, I also have zero tolerance to gabapentin righr now.

Questions:

1. U guys think its safe to wake up at 6am and take a tiny piece of sub (.5mg) to start my induction then 1mg every hour henceforth or is that way too early to start? 

2. Should I take some gabapentin around 7am and go back to bed so I'm feeling the gaba buzz when I wake at 10am? If not when is a good time to gobble the Johnny rottens and how much will suffice?

3. Can loperamide be combined with suboxone for withdrawals or will the bupe just block the lope?

4. Besides Tylenol are there any other OTC meds that would really help? I.e. would 40mgs of dxm be helpful at all?

5. Banging addies is euphoric no doubt, how much should I take, I don't want to get too anxious and jittery?

6. I've inducted in the past with no pain to speak off, but it's been so long and I don't remember my cocktails and technique.  Do you guys think I can do an induction so I am 100% withdrawal free by noon tomorrow given my circumstances and substances  available?

After the first two days of being on suboxone, however, I feel completely well again.  Am I the only one that experiences this when using suboxone to quit a habbit?  Or is it the same for everyone else?",1475626927.0

Well sniffing some of Nwk finest ECP a few weeks back also felt great. I'm still completely sober (just not clean anymore) from all other drugs and alcohol. Yes, alcohol is a drug. I have used two buns twice a week (two bundles over 2-3 days 2x week) for 3 or 4 weeks now. On Sunday, after finishing up my stash on Saturday) I decided that I want to get clean again for a while.

Day 3: man do I feel like shit! I guess when you're using the absolute fire brick city brown the withdrawal is unavoidable. This is new WD for me though. I can eat, exercise, sleep decent and the shits aren't too bad but DAMN do I FEEL LIKE DEATH. Flu like symptoms, entire body aches, racing thoughts, cravings.... the works. Hopefully I will start feeling better soon I wasn't ready for this.

Six months clean.,"Today marks six months since my overdose. I wrote about it on this sub before I unsubscribed - you can read it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/4dd5xe/first_od_in_8_years_of_use_thanks_narcan_but_also/). I just went back and read that post for the first time since I wrote it and it gave me chills. I forgot about the sternum rub. 

So I've been clean from heroin for six months. I may have relied a little too much on Xanax in the months immediately following, but I've been off of that too since July. 

Things were rough for a while. I recovered physically within a few weeks, and eventually the cravings weren't as strong, but I still felt empty, and my self-esteem was completely shattered. I decided I needed to make some big life changes to start feeling like myself again, and I ended up moving out of my parents' house to my own place in the city. This was terrifying and gave me a lot of severe anxiety that I knew I couldn't treat with heroin. I also stopped talking to the ex I mentioned in my first post - he was there for me and helped me get on my feet, but trying to stay friends became extremely toxic for the both of us. 

But six months later, I'm still here, I've stayed clean, and for the first time perhaps ever I can honestly say that being clean doesn't feel like a capitulation, it doesn't feel like I've lost somehow, it actually feels like a victory. Something that's worth keeping at. 

Somehow, against all odds, my life is actually enjoyable now because of the hard work I put into it back when it all seemed pretty futile. I love living on my own in a new city, I've made all kinds of new friends and I'm never at a lack of anything to do socially. I started seeing someone new - I told him after about a month and a half of dating about my past and he was so incredibly sweet and supportive about it, and I really think that's headed somewhere good. I started working a dream volunteer gig doing something I've wanted to do for over a decade now. 

Back when I was using and for a couple of months after my overdose it seemed pointless to try and put any kind of effort into my life that didn't involve getting high. Now I can't believe how lucky I am to be alive and sober for all of this, because things actually feel *good*. Things are still stressful and I imagine they always will be, but I no longer immediately think of dope whenever things start to go south, and that in itself I consider an achievement. 

Anyway, thanks for reading. I just wanted to mark this day somehow since I still can't talk to too many people about it. Sometimes it's hard to recall where I was six months ago, but I also want to honor and respect how far I've come instead of pretending it never happened. If anyone wants to talk please feel free to PM me. ",1475614107.0

Please let me know if I'm wrong, I'll go somewhere else. 

But, its just as the title says. 
I've known my best friend Melissa for 5 years. Melissa has always been into experimenting with drugs, and got into a little bit of trouble with them when we were in high school. I thought after getting help in hs she was over experimenting, but then she met her boyfriend Matt and moved in with him and she started messing with drugs again. I warned her months ago that she was getting out of control and going too far but she told me she knew what she was doing and she was fine. Anytime I tried to talk to her about it she'd ignore me or say she was just having fun. Well, she called me Saturday night and told me she needed my help, that she messed up and she's been using heroin for 5 months now and is up to 10 times a day.


Her and her boyfriend are using really heavily and she told me that she wants to stop but she needs my help. She wants me to go over to her apartment next weekend and take care of her, her pets and her boyfriend while they withdrawal...but I don't know how to do that. I barely even know her boyfriend, I've met him literally 2 times. I've never been around people coming down and I've heard how horrible it is detoxing from heroin and I don't know what I would do. She keeps begging me to come over and help them but I'm honestly scared and I tried sending her phone numbers and websites for free help with addiction but she said that she can't go to rehab because she has a job and bills and can't afford to go away, and that she cant leave her dog? I can't tell her mom because her mom is abusive and is not stable right now (diagnosed Borderline Personality Disorder and Bipolar Disorder and a few other things, but she's not on ANY medication or therapy) and she doesn't have anyone else. She keeps texting me and telling me that I'm her best friend, I promised I'd always be there for her, and just begging me to go over but I'm scared. Please, I don't know what to do for her and her boyfriend but I don't want to just leave them to die. We've already lost 3 friends to heroin overdoses and I honestly don't know what I'd do without her. What do I do? Should I go over and try to help? If I do go, what do I need to watch out for? I don't want to call the police because she'll just go to jail, but she needs help and I'm unsure of what to do. 


tl;dr My bestfriend and her boyfriend are addicted to heroin and she's begging me to go over and help her with the withdrawal, I don't know how or what to do. Please help",1475610912.0

First off I'd just like to say that I love this sub and all the interesting people on here, you guys rock. I've been a lurker here for awhile because anything I wanted to ask has already been answered, this question has probably been answered as well but I couldn't find a good answer. 

I tried Google but the only answers I received were from lesser quality forums so I'd rather ask here. 

I've been using H on and off again for a while now but it's become a daily thing the last 3 weeks. My ROA has always been insufflation. 

It's kind of amazing how quickly I built up a tolerance or my nose doesn't absorb it properly. 

I don't want to start shooting up so I've been  looking into different ways of getting high. I mostly get #4 and it's almost impossible to smoke this stuff, or I just can't get it right. 

I would try to plug it but feel it will be a waste since I have been so constipated I haven't taken a shit in about 4 days. 

Here's the question, is it possible to take my powder sublingually and is it worth it or would it be a waste? Would it be similar to sniffing or would you get alot less in your system? 

Sorry for the long post for a quick question but I'm feeling good and got into writing this. 

Thanks in advance and happy nods to everyone. May junkie jesus bless you all!

Always been low because we haven't been able to get into a clinic or see a sub doctor so we've been buying them off the streets- taking too much wouldn't be much cheaper than just using, and I'm terrified of running out and having really bad w/ds that force us back into using daily. Figure the lower I can keep my dose, the better in that aspect. 

I've fucked up a few times since I've been on it, so maybe mentally it's not enough and I really should be taking more. My boyfriend takes a bit more than me and he hasn't fucked up once and is doing much better mentally than I am. 

I'm just scared of going backwards. I'm sure a higher dose would help, but wouldn't I be in the same place when I wean back down, anyway? I've heard of people dropping their dose with no issue but do the cravings and such start up again the lower you get? Did you still have a hard time at the end?

I keep thinking about a friend of mine who was on subs for a couple of years, slowly dropped down to like, the lowest dosage possible and still couldn't stop. Went to rehab to try and get off of the subs for good, and within a couple of months she's shooting dope (previously snorted oxy).

I just worry that there's no end in sight and I'm just fooling myself into thinking I'm okay by taking methadone and having the occasional slip up with oxy or dope (well, let's be honest, a few times in less than a month isn't even occasional).

So I put the powder on and only 25 units of water so the citric is more concentrated put some heat to it and jackpot it's all breaking up and is a nice golden brown liquid :) Draw up another 40 units and add it to the liquid and give it another heat . Stir it up and put the cap back on the syringe and draw up the hit through the micro filter that is built into the syringe cap .

Idk what to do anymore. Im seeing one other set of specialists at virgina Mason hospital to see if they can adjust my meds to help me with this. If not im either going to have a feeding tube implanted of have my pancreas completely removed.

It is mainly talking about how, naturally, we as children are ""wild"". But we have been put into a cinderblock world (school), and that has made us lose some of our open attention, among other things. 

I thought this section of the article was really neat and I wanted to share it with y'all. Not sure if any of you will find interest in it.


""Some of our children, it turns out, are more like pigeons and squirrels, and some are more like bears.  Some of them adapt to the institutional walls we put around them, and some of them pace till their paws bleed.  The bleeding of these children, if we listen, can tell us many stories about ourselves.  The boy drugged with Adderall tells us a story of forests full of trees to climb, rivers to swim and paddle, open meadows to run across.  The girl who slowly starves herself tells us of a family and clan in which acceptance is a birthright rather than something we compete for with thinness and good grades.  The kids who fight back, who become defiant to the point of self-destruction, tell us a story of freedom from authoritarian control, from petty rewards and punishments, from endless surveillance and evaluation.  The kids who turn to drugs tell us of feelings of warmth, of energy, of intimacy, of peace that they don’t find in their lives of never-ending scheduled competitive busy-work.For decades our model of drug addiction has been based on research done on laboratory rats provided with a lever they could press to deliver water laced with heroin or cocaine.  Researchers found the rats would press the lever and consume the drug until it killed them, and they concluded that the drug itself was the cause of the addictive behavior.  But then a psychologist named Bruce Alexander noticed something.  The rats who killed themselves in this way were isolated in an unnatural environment, a barren Skinner box where there was nothing rewarding to do but self-stimulate with drugs.  When they were placed in a more varied, more natural setting, able to interact freely with the environment and with other rats, their drug use was reduced by more than three quarters.  In other words, if you gave them a life they wanted to live, and a world they wanted to live in, they did not destroy themselves.   Or, as author Johann Hari has put it:   It’s not you. It’s your cage.""



Not saying this is me in anyway, but it makes sense in my head and I really enjoyed reading that section of the article. Everyone should read the whole thing too, it is beautifully written and makes so much sense. Here is the link: http://carolblack.org/on-the-wildness-of-children/

I am a longtime lurker but finally felt the need to get this off my chest. It all started two years ago when I got my new job an a union Ironworker. If any of you work physical labor, opiates enable you to work harder and longer. Immediately I relied on them as a crutch. Your classic addiction cycle began and now two years later I can't go more than 6 hours without starting to become sick. 

I still have the luxury of living at home, with my parents and I have to say I am so not were I need to be in my life. I have pissed away thousands upon thousands of dollars. I have no bills to pay besides the essentialls such as car,credit card,cell phone,food etc...and it's such a shame seeing the amount I have saved up compared to what it should be.

For the longest time I knew I could not sustain this lifestyle, but I genuinely was only concerned about were my next high waa coming from. Now my future is the driving factor in getting clean. I want more than anything to be free from these chemical shackles. So that is exactly what I am going to do.

I have given myself off the rest of this week and next week for work, I'm going to hunker down and get the absolute shit beat out of me with these withdrawals. But I know it will feel AMAZING to be sober. I kicked before for 7 days about a year ago and I regret ever getting back on. I no that's no large amount of time but I know what's in store for me the next few days of agony. I have access to Xanax,lope,magnesium,lyrica.  Definitely going to use them liberally. 

I'm so scared, but I'm ready this time. I have never admitted this to anyone ever in my life. This is the first time I have put this down in writing..by all means I was a functioning addict...but fuck that shit.",1475768908.0

It turned out they were opioid agonists or something and they made me really sick, I think they do something similar to narcan and clean out the opiate receptors in the brain or some science like that,. I went unconscious and woke up a few minutes later in the recovery position and in full opiate withdrawl.  My girl friend induced vomiting with a tooth brush and i puked up 5 to 10 pills.  I know I know. Dont take something that u don't know about properly,it was a very long time ago and I was in a very destructive place in my life.

Could fentanyl do something like this to your brain when ur on methadone maintenance and u take a hit up the nose?   Possibly making u go into withdrawl or is it just a normal opiate like morphine pills would be ??

I was on about a 45 day binge of 180mg of Oxy a day. Spread out over two doses, one morning and one night. I decided I need to get my life together and get off this shit. I had 11 30mg Oxy's. The following is my plan so far and what I am going through. Any insight would be greatly appreciated.
Day1: 105mg dosed once in the evening
Day2: Felt really bad at work. Dosed 60mg in the evening which helped me get through the night
Day3: I felt worse than the previous day. Chills, extreme restlessness and anxiety. Almost didn't make it to my scheduled evening dosing time. Dosed 45mg in the evening and drank a few beers to help calm down. Slept ok... about 5 hours
Day 4: Today.... feeling really bad. Extreme anxiety and restlessness. I feel like I want to die. I plan on dosing 37.5mg this evening.
Day 5: Plan to dose 30mg in the evening
Day 6: Plan to dose 22.5 mg in the vening
Day 7: Plan to dose 15mg in the evening
Day 8: Plan to dose 7.5mg in the evening
Day 9: Plan to dose 7.5 mg in the evening
Day 10: First day of cold Turkey. Run out of pills.

This is affecting my job and my relationship. I can't afford to lose either. Please advise on when I should start feeling better than I am right now. I am in hell. Does this seem like a reasonable way to minimize WD symptoms to make them the most bearable? Please help. Thanks!!!

Each pill cost 30 dollars a piece and I have to give my middle a half of pill and lately the fucker has been doing shit like oh the dilaudid pd's are 33 dollars all of a sudden he tells me today and so I tell him well can't do it then i'll just go get suboxone he then tries running some more game ""the el's suck you have to shoot up a full one just to feel anything..."" blah blah I have shot up both and they both have the same feel and the same amount of filler left behind. I have known this middle since middle school for about 15 years and he thinks hes fucking clever when really I just have pity on him for being such a bum and scumbag who is so delusional and thinks he is some sort of force to be reckoned with because he gets over here and there especially with me because. Last month I gave him 150 dollars to go to his doctors appointment he tells me he will give me 7 pills for giving him the cash to go. Long story short he fucked me out of the money and so I repaid the favor by actually calling his doctor that he goes to and telling the doctor that if he kept this person on his client list that it would bring some very unwarranted attention to his clinic I told the doc a convincing story that I was this kids father gave him the name and told him I was a police officer which his father was and I had all the info on his father to impersonate him the fucker tried to go back to the doctor and of course was thrown out of the doc's office never to return so fucked his game up decent. The dumbass didn't know that I snapped a photo of his paperwork one day knowing I could use it in a situation like this also knowing his father is a cop I got his credentials one day while over there also good for black mailing since this kid was being a dirty little harry.. There is more he shit talks about everyone and twists there heads up because they all do meth except for me and they all are sociopathic compulsive liars who are delusional and just outright unskilled unproductive losers. Now I am a loser to but I don't compulsively lie and I will go sick and withdraw rather than some really grimey compromise to my boundaries on my moral compass. I am also productive and work for my habit and this makes people like him feel like they should get more when I go to pick up like 200 dollars worth. Well I have finally just had my limit with people like him and also the whole lifestyle all together and mostly the people in it are the factors that are making me quit. I love the drug but the prices are to high and the people who currently playing the game are just stupid little cunts who I just want to see in a year after getting my finances back in order and a few items that will surely make them very jelly I will get a better high from knowing that it burns a hole in there ass that I have quit and obtained success all the while while still being able to throw the little bitch 30 or even 60 dollars to watch him go get high and see him standing in the same spot that in itself will be a high for me for all the shit things this little fucker has done and that his father has done. 


FTTPNBSATLDR (FuckTheTopPostNothingButShitpostAndToLongDidn'tRead)
Read here if you want to skip the middle man shit post drama and just want to read my inquiry on suboxone tapering method.....

I have had about a half pill habit chipping mostly for the last 4 months. I was taking Dilaudid 8mg and Opana IR 10MG. Last month I had some more money so I was doing a whole pill a day every day and now do to quite a few factors I will not have any money to continue this habit. I still need to work my job though luckily it's a work at home position so it's not to bad but I can't deal with psychological withdraw factors as well as the physical symptoms. I didn't think I would have such withdraw after just one month use of what I think is a relatively small habit but I recently had to stop for 2 and a half days and it was very shitty 2 and a half days. The symptoms I had were hyper sweats, inconsistent sleep due to drug dreams and also hyper sweating, upon waking very cold from the sweating, very depressed no motivation to get out of bed which made me play hookie for work (I clocked in on the time sheet but didnt actually take any phone calls I am hoping my boss won't notice until next pay period) at times feeling suicidal and irritable (I know this is normal but the suicidal thoughts really really suck because I have acted on them before) Second night can't sleep at all because of hyper sweats and anxiety which make it impossible for me to work depression is worse and time distortion begins, extreme cravings at this point, and I have energy but I am just to depressed to do anything and just lay around, at night I am unable to sleep and the insomnia is the thing that always causes me to relapse that and the depression. My question is if I get 5 8mg subs and do a half of one 4 mg a day 2mg in the morning 2mg before bed for 10 days and then taper down using a 4mg only 4mg on day 11 and then day 12 jump to only 2mg and then try not to take anything after day 12 only if i can't sleep would I take 1mg. Will this work to where I won't have such bad depression and insomnia and other psychological symptoms mainly all I care about is the insomnia factor and the fucking hyper sweats as well as maintaining some level of motivation during the days i'm not IV'n. If any of you have done something similar to this and have had similar symptoms please share your thoughts and stories as well as any suggestions to combating the aforementioned symptoms the idea here is to keep me functional for work.

I feel the strangest mix of euphoria, anger, and disappointment. I couldn't even keep a week clean. I made it five fucking days. Just five. How in the fuck...

I even had to take time to prepare everything. Boil some water, weigh out a dose of heroin, prep the filter, disinfect my arm, find a vein (on the first try too), and shove that plunger down. Took about 15 minutes, every second of which I was screaming at myself not to do this. But I did it anyway.

I've broken so many promises tonight to people I care about more than life itself. People who've saved my life, who are still trying to save me, who give a damn about me. And I don't know if I can lie to them again. I shouldn't even try, but I don't know what the fuck is gonna come out of my mouth in two days when I see most of them.

I don't know why I'm writing all of this. I'm sorry for bitching and feeling far too much self-pity for a mess I got myself into. But fuck, it's such a unique feeling. No depression at all, barely any worries. Utter relaxation and I hate it.

At least I'm completely out now. I shouldn't have to deal with physical WD either. Maybe I'll have better luck since I don't have easy access to any more H.

Guess I just wanted to get this off my chest. I'll tell the truth to my counselor because she deserves the truth from me. I don't know if I can bring myself to tell anyone else, though.

I was wondering if you would ever vote for someone that was open about their past drug use / addiction. Obama came out saying he smoked a lot of pot and did some cocaine and became president. i think when a candidate tells the voters, particularly young voters, that they have experimented with drugs and alcohol, it sends the message that you can still be successful even if you tried drugs while young. If a former addict ran for public office and was honest with their drug use, do you think that would benefit or hurt them? I think it would help because they would understand why people use and what addiction is like and that will help them form policies that work. I would definitely vote for a former addict because he would be able to understand, on a personal level, the drug epidemic that is occurring right now and would be able to pass legislation that could help.

https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/4p9hz8/drizzle/



With the last suburb beyond the rearview, I'm settling in the drivers seat. The warm glow of relief has faded but comfort is everything when you've been at this long enough. 

My phone dings, a text message coming through. I know better, I just hand it to jess to deal with. Things are calm and happy and I wanna keep it like that.

""Its fuckin drizzle. He wants to know when we will be back. Did you tell him we were going?"" 

Aw fuck. So much for calm and happy. He's not her favorite person, and I really should have told her.

""Yeah.. I figured we could use the money."" 

""I know but he's always right there waiting for us to get home. He always wants a front, a free shot, a little more.. I just wanna get home so we can enjoy a night together. He never leaves, always wants to stay over. And he eats all our food..""

She continues to point out drizzles least favorable attributes as I nod and agree. She makes a strong case. But he always comes through with the future payment, and he's a friend. I mostly keep that to myself. But, I have a way with words that she's grown accustomed to. She knows my agreement is with her facts, not her plan.

Halfway home I've been driving an hour and a half. I pull over to do a shot amid much protest, and she takes over the drivers seat.

""Be home in an hour and a half. Don't leave for a full hour though, jess will hate me if we pull in and you're waiting in the driveway."" I text back.

""Word, see you around midnight"" he texts back. As my phone dings, Jess turns her head toward me and sighs. 

""You didn't."" She guesses incorrectly.

We pull in the driveway, happy to get home with a few fat bags of dope so we can finally eat a meal together and cuddle. As she pulls into the driveway, I can feel the happiness and warmth dissipate between us as her headlights illuminate drizzles Tahoe. 

""God fucking damnit krew."" She sighs, resigned. ""I thought we at least had time to unwimd. Can we get him out of here tonight? Like, within an hour?""

""Well, we can try."" I hope so.



""God fuckin damnit! This shots clogged now!"" Drizzles low, beefy voice booms as his petulant anger takes over. 

""Do you want me to hit you? Need a fresh? What's up?"" I ask, trying to diffuse the situation before Jess offers her opinion.

""Naw I will just fuckin plug it, shit! Fuck it. I hope it works.""

As he walks to the bathroom she gives me that look. That look that says, Im done being nice. I nod and sigh. I know he overstayed his welcome when he pulled into the driveway. Im stuck between two people with very different plans, and I wish I could say I was trying to please everyone. But in retrospect I wasnt doing much to make her or me happy.

""Fuck, I hate wasting dope like that."" Drizzle tells us as he takes a seat at the table. ""Any way you could hook me up with another shot and I will send the cash your way on Tuesday?"" He asks. I hear jess mutter something under her breath as she gets up and walks away.

""Yeah fine, but this is my personal."" I say, hoping she can hear. ""Be careful, its different stuff. Its really good."" I tell him as I weigh out a few little pebbles for him. 

Im focused on my 8th impotent shot for the night, as I hear him say ""yes, finally."" By the time his words register in my focused mind, I ask if he hit a vein.

No answer.

I look up, and he's still sitting upright. But his face is ashen grey and his lips are blue.

""Ohhh fuuuuuuck! JESS! Call 911, tell them our friend stopped breathing. Do NOT mention drugs, k?"" 

She comes in at a quick stride to see me lowering his body to the kitchen floor. ""Oh, shit"" she offers.

""I'm gonna breathe for him.. Please try and get a paramedic here. Hopefully if you don't mention drugs the cops won't come.

For almost 15 minutes I breathed for him. Jess artfully dodged questions on the phone that seemed to become more and more pointed. I cant continue though, I'm getting light headed.

""Can you take over? Just pinch his nose and breath into him, I will tilt his head back for you..."" I say to her. She tells the operator she can hear the sirens and hangs up, dropping to her knees next to me.

Then, I hear the sirens. And somewhere deep in drizzles mind, he must have heard them too. Because just then he sat up, with a very confused look on his face.

""What's going on?"" He asks as he starts sliding the looped belt down his arm.

""You fell out. Think the ambulance is here."" I inform him.

""Naw man, I just passed out for a minute. I got drunk last night, but I'm fine. Just tired"" he assures us.

The paramedics were cool. The first two anyway. Drizzle is puking in a trash can as he's telling them he's fine. He told them he had the flu, so he took some vicodin and drove over to hang out with us tonight. They repeat the story back clearly and concisely, with no inflection or even hint of disbelief. I know how ridiculous it sounds though.

Just then another ambulance pulls in from another nearby town (we werent near civilization). I level with the older, well tempered EMT. 

""Look, can we keep this between us?"" I ask, as Jess leaves the room. He nods.

""That's fine, absolutely. I'm just worried about his safety."" He tells me.

""Good. We were doing heroin. He overdosed. I gave him mouth to mouth til you got here."" I say, finally letting the truth out in the room. The front door opens as two more EMTs walk in, but nice guy paramedic does me a solid.

""Everything is OK here, sorry. But we have it under control. You can go."" He tells them. They give us a confused, slightly pissed off look but turn around and leave without a word.

""OK."" Says the older EMT as the door shuts. ""You're lucky your friend was awake to help you."" He tells drizzle. ""You guys should really get some narcan, being way out here. Anyhow, we just wanna take your blood pressure and make sure you're OK.""

He takes drizzles BP, and its a little high. ""It is pretty high"" he tells drizzle.

""Do I have to go to the ER?"" Asks drizzle. The EMT looks over drizzles shoulder to me and I nod, hopefully pleadingly.

""Well, we want to make sure you live tonight."" He tells drizzle. I hand drizzle his coat as Jess opens the front door, and into the night they go.

Sure we drove into town at 5am when drizzle mistakenly thought he was being released. He was still nodding out in his hopital bed, and the nurse said he was in no shape to leave. On his drive into town they pulled over twice to administer Narcan to him.

At 9am we drove in to pick him up for real. When we got back we all took a few hours to sleep.

And...sigh, here we are with a new script for the unbearable pain of average daily life (and our backs).

The last time I came down, cold as a antarctic turkey.  The sweating that is attached to the massive panic engulfing your mind, poured out onto my bed as I debated a trip to the ER.  It's like bad acid.  Once you take it, you have no choice but to ride it out.  There is no part of your brain left with even an ounce of coping skills.  And so I succumb to madness.  Would the ER even help?  Could they give me a tranquilizer?  Would they even see me after the 5 hours I sit there waiting, pulling on my hair which is attached to my soul...which is thrashing like a dying snake in the corner of a hot Iraqi hotel room.  

I didn't go to the ER.  And by pure luck I have saved some benzos.  I take as many as I can knowing that I am on a raft in a black and super-massive ocean...rations on the benzos are so very important.  

Okay, the story of my withdrawal is not my point of writing here, so I will spare you my tale of babies on ceilings and shaking hands with shit-demons.  I do need to summarize though.  This withdrawal was NOT OKAY.  It was soooo far from being okay.  I think it scarred parts of my mind and body permanently.  I can't forget the infinite terror (that did end up finite, but felt forever in the moment.)   I shudder now as I write.  Shudder through the 100mgs of oxy that makes the word ""shudder"" actually smile at me.  Hello there ""shudder"", and not today my friend. 

These cycles.  These looping days/months to years.  How do we visit such pain inducing regions of our psyche, and then how in the FUCK do we convince ourselves to do it again?!?!?!

I like to visualize that I am laying down a beautiful euphoric pathway.  I am setting these wondrous stones down one by one and the road to the shimmering castle is nearly complete.  I will arrive at the huge wooden doors (gold inlay, of course).  They will open.  Topless, fuck it- bottomless as well-  Woman of divine perfection will escort me on my guided tour of this sleepy-warm and sexually pleasant castle in the poppy-sky.  I am so content.  So I lay out in the courtyard...am I sleeping?  Who cares...I've got no fucks to give.  Well, I've got plenty of actual fucks.  Breasts and bush come smother me with pleasant pheromonal qualities.

OH SHIT! WHAT'S THIS?!!!  Surely I left one in a bag or couch crack somewhere.  Yeahhhh, you know that castle?  We know that castle we were just in?  It's funny because that castle ha. ha. ha.  That never even existed at this point.  Because those wondrous memories have been brown-washed to hell.  HELL where we are sitting and in hell, those clocks tick quite a bit slower then the flat earth above. 

Ughhh...I am trying to understand with all of you.  Are we just hedons, literally the gods of hedon?  Are we stupid?  Maybe we want to die.  How many more times will we do this?

I mean this time around I was just going to enjoy movies on the WEEKENDS.  Then the bottle would be hidden in the house (from burglars not me).  But as we all know, I am doing more than enjoying movies.  I am enjoying breathing, looking at walls, not looking at walls, not doing-being-or-trying.  Yeah, I enjoy the things...ALL OF THEM.  In a couple of days I will break.

We'd get to your house and run upstairs, only 15 or so minutes until your mom got home. We'd pack the bong, hit the patio, blast The Beatles and smoke until we were on the floor coughing. That 70's Show was always on at this time, right after Scrubs finished. We always talked about how similar your dad was to Red Foreman. We were young, high, and had no idea what the world had in store for us, but we were happy. Your house always had the best snacks.

You were 16. I drove us all home after school, and as always, we'd unload at your place. You and Marcus would argue over who'd roll today's blunt, and I'd sit back and laugh at how dumb the two of you were. Your mom stopped caring about us smoking pot, cause we were on the verge of young adulthood and both got accepted into the college of our dreams. Getting stoned wasn't quite what it used to be, as with all the pressures of becoming an adult, came unwarranted amounts of anxiety. We were also too old to act the way we used to when we got high, something that really only seemed to affect me because you were always so damn mature. I hated that. Your cousin sold us some xanax, and we'd split one into three and drift away. For those couple of hours we were untouchable. Nothing mattered, we were the only ones who existed. We couldn't imagine life any other way, why bother? Nobody could tell us we weren't living life exactly how we were supposed to.

You were 18. You finally had set up our dorm exactly how we envisioned; TV's facing opposite direction so screen-looking was a thing of the past, microwave on top of the toaster oven on top of the mini fridge, a drawer full of weed paraphernalia and 7 posters of our favor artists, movie scenes and cliche college quirks. You passed me the straw as I broke my roxy in half, pieces flying everywhere that I would eventually try and find later.. You were more accurate then you thought your were when you would joke about me doing that. I'd separate the big, fluffy line into three smaller ones, and you'd suck yours down all at once. My tolerance was the same as yours was, but I lacked the $200 check you'd get from your parents every Monday. I was always kind of annoyed by that, but you'd occasionally show my broke-ass some love. Me and my girlfriend were fighting, and it got so bad that you drove me 400 miles to see her while your car was literally falling apart every step of the way. Your parents were so pissed that you drove while your car was in that kinda condition, but you told them it was something you had to do. It actually hurt you to see me cry, cause it was something you had never seen me do in the 14 years we were friends. Your transmission was replaced and your parents were $2400 poorer, but we were on our way back to school. You had just affirmed yourself as the most caring person in my life. My dad had passed and my mom was back in France, but I had you.. and for that I was pretty damn lucky.

It was your 19th birthday. It was my birthday literally just the day before, and we would always celebrate them together. You walked into the dorm and I pretended not to notice you, which had recently become the norm. I had the funniest story of this failed attempt to spit game at some girls after psych class, but I knew I'd be saying that for someone else. We had stopped talking for about a month now, due to your stubbornness and my inability to break a grudge, regardless of how petty it may have been. You were wearing long sleeves in July, but I didn't notice. You'd sit on your bed and watch ancient aliens, and I'd find some excuse to leave the dorm. Your presence drove me mad, as I'm sure mind did yours. Truthfully, I don't think either of us knew why we were fighting, only that we were and that any attempt to act otherwise would make us look weak. My connection to all things opiate were officially cut off, but yours only grew stronger. After a fun week of dope-sickness, I finally started feeling like myself again. The benzos would kick in, and I'd head out to my new friends house. We'd hit every club, every big sporting event or social gathering we caught wind of, so we could take dope photos for people to admire on Facebook. You'd sit at the dorm, and watch ancient aliens with the lights always off.. No matter what time I'd come home, you were at the dorm watching that damn show. I brought some girl home one night, praying that you had found something else to do. You hadn't, and I officially had to take her somewhere else. I made sure to be as loud and obnoxious as I could while grabbing my shit, ensuring that you acknowledged my presence and current lifestyle as better than yours before walking out. It still hurt to see you like that...
You said nothing. You were still wearing a long sleeve shirt, and I still hadn't noticed.

You were 22. You were outside of the gas station when I drove up, smoking a cigarette. You were bench pressing 185lbs at 14 years old our freshmen year of highschool, and here you were a senior in college looking like you weighed maybe a buck twenty. Your skin was pale, and the bags under your eyes hung about as low as my thoughts of you at that time. I smiled and you smiled, but we had nothing to say to one another. We were strangers, and we both had very different things to do. I saw you a couple weeks later, and I was pretty drunk. You looked even worse than you did the last time I saw you, which had to have been a hard task to accomplish. I was worried. I spent twenty minutes lecturing you and trying to mirror your image onto yourself so that you could see what I saw, but it was hopeless. You didn't see the issue, either that or you were too far gone and refused to acknowledge it. The kid behind you was sketchy and hung around you like a shadow, stepping in when I started to get emotional. He told me to fuck off, and I blamed him for destroying my best friend. The drunken tears started to fall, but my friends in the car were yelling my name. The tears were wiped away quicker then they fell, but I know you noticed them. Your friend laughed, but you didn't. I still cared, and you did too.

You were 23. Your oldest brother had received his sentence, and would be doing 17 years for trafficking, possession and selling to an undercover. Your younger brother still wouldn't talk to you. You had just gotten out of jail for violating probation, after getting caught stealing a drug test at Walmart. I heard the news and almost laughed, I couldn't understand how far you had fallen. You were always so much better than me in life, it was unreal to see how things had changed. I had my degree, a good job and a support system of friends that held through everything. You had a criminal record, a pocket full of pills and contact list full of people you either bought drugs from or sold to. I'd see you occasionally as I drove to work, and every time it was like seeing a ghost. I had no feelings for you anymore, no judgement. My painkiller habit had picked back up, but for some reason I still felt above you. I ended up running into you a few weeks ago, while I was picking up a few oxy 30's from my dude. You seemed almost excited that we were back on the same plane of existence, but I was disgusted. You tried conversing, generally interested in how I was, what I was doing these days and how my mom was. My answers were short, and I couldn't get away from you fast enough. It was obvious, and it didn't take you long to notice. You had fallen pretty low, but you were still as conscious as ever. I watched you take a long drag of your cigarette as I pulled away, staring directly into eachothers eyes. We were officially on two different planes of existence. I had no business on yours, and vise versa. This was the last time I ever saw you.

I got the news today. Your name and face was plastered across my Facebook wall, where every memory and funny instance with you was on full display. I considered writing my own status in your memory, but I couldn't. It just didn't feel right after all we had been through, and how I had treated you over the years. The cause of death wasn't broadcasted, but it didn't need to be, I already knew. Though it feels like 10 years since I've spoken to you, I can't help but think about all the time we spent together. Every minute of my life from 7 years old until 19, involved you in some way. You were the kid who I experienced life with, who I made mistakes with, who I got my first kiss next to.. You always gave me shit for having my eyes wide open. You brought me to parties, you fought alongside me, you accepted me as a brother and let me into your family when I felt like I didn't have my own. You cheered for me when I won, cried with me when I lost, and threw up with me when I was drunk or dope sick. You cared about me, through everything, and I threw you out of my life when you needed me the most. You never needed me, you were always the one I relied on for anything I went through, but you were always okay. When the time came that you weren't, I no longer had a need for you. I abandoned you, and you still forgave me. You still sent me invites on Xbox live, you still told funny stories about me with mutual friends and you still told your parents about all I had accomplished. You still gave a shit, you still cared. You were no longer a part of my life, but I was always a piece of yours, just a little lost along the way. You were the greatest thing I ever gave up in this lifetime, I'm sure of that.

You were my best friend. ",1475699264.0

I'm sure I'm not the only one on here with a true phobia. Though I'll never claim my phobia is more ""real"" than yours, I do believe that it is a different *type* of phobia, as the feared results match the actual physical effects almost 100%

In this case im talking about my insanely high allergy to the venom of the wasp family. For those who don't know, that's wasps, yellow jackets, hornets (white and yellow face), and also one species of fire ant

I found out when I stepped on a wasp in the mid 90s. Luckily I was at school, literally across the street from the hospital. 

I haven't done any ""real"" opiates (anything beside bupe) for about 2ish weeks now? But what just happened is... horrifying

I took out the trash, and coming in the door a yellow jacket followed me through the door unnoticed until about 20 minutes ago. Then I saw the fucker staring at me from the couch. Despite almost 7 years of weekly allergy shots (which *never* improved, I stopped years later at the exact same tiny dosage where I started!) I am highly FUCKING allergic to these creatures. 

My anaphylactic shock system is so sensitive to it that if a particular insects' venom is molecularly correct enough for my body, I could be unconscious and dying before I have time to even get my epi pen out of my pocket. If 2+ sting me at a time it's an almost guaranteed death sentence

I've known this for over half my life. I have also lived almost my entire life in the deep south... the wasp family's stronghold on this continent. I haven't been stung since 2008, and luckily I was hiking with a buddy who had my epi pen in his hand when we saw the nest

Being in my 30s, single and living alone and having to kill this yellow jacket is one of the most horrifying things that's happened to me in at least a year- probably since my surgery a year and a half ago in February. But this was more of a chance of death than that by far

Now I'm hoping that this norco comes through because not only am I in the midst of ultra panic attack mode (like, can barely breathe or think ab anything else, terrified to move from where I am for irrational fear of others, still too shocked to cry but beyond obvious that the cry will happen). I have bars and kpins and even some Valium but 

I need some FUCKING hardcore poppy products. It honestly feels like I just came out of the Jon Snow vs Ramsey Bolton battle alive from game of thrones (won't spoil who does or doesn't live for those who haven't seen). 

Jesus Christ. Fuck these early fall days in the south where it's still 90 degrees outside and the entire populace of wasps and yellow jackets are either slowly dying or all out roaming everywhere for food- it's fucking awful

Personally I don't have many interests other than video games and opiates. Going to try and change that though, I've been trying to read a bit more, and I'm looking to get into something else to keep me busy and my mind occupied. I think I'll learn to cook to begin with, as they say diet helps with depression, and I'll start exercising. These seem more like good habits rather than interest though to be honest. I also want to learn to make video games, as I think I'd be good at it, I have so many ideas, and if I could find the motivation in me to make a full game I could make some moneys (would that mean it wasn't a hobby anymore?). Tying into that I also want to develop my art and music skills but also maybe get into a craft, woodworking or something like that. It sounds like I want to do everything lol, which I guess isn't untrue, it's just motivation. Is it true that once you invest in something and increase your skill some that your interest and motivation increases naturally? I think if I started to feel competent in a skill it'd encourage me to keep going, just gotta get past that ""I suck so bad at this"" beginning phase!

I've been an intermittent opiate user for the past decade or so and gone through mild (but still bad enough to be decidedly unpleasant) WDs a few times. I've definitely got a bit of a tolerance but nothing too bad; never mainlined, always stopped when it was clear I was developing a spiraling habit. Anyways after years of not having one I found a hookup for H. In my excitement I hit it hard for about a week. I could definitely tell my tolerance was increasing, but a gram would keep me pleasantly high just smoking H and working all day. I stopped a week ago and had mild/moderate WDs which weren't pleasant but weren't too bad since I could just lie in bed a lot of the time and are gone now (sneezing, felt very weak, hot/cold flashes, but no nausea, pain, anxiety, etc.).

Anyways I would like to return to chipping again. Considering I quit a week ago and WDs are gone, could I use for a day now without restarting the WD process, or do I need to wait longer?

Sorry, that was kind of wordy but it all seemed relevant I guess.

edit: Reporting back in. I used on day 7 of withdrawal, about half as much as usual, but as I was saying I was hitting it hard. Next day I felt fine. Two days later (today) I believe I may be going through a minor sort of withdrawal. I'm experiencing some lethargy and sneezing, but not nearly to the degree of the first withdrawal.

Ive been scratching/rubbing/using forks/lotions basically anything i can to cease this itching but nothing is working! It is really driving me insane to the point i cant even enjoy the high. Ive been itching so bad i have broken skin, caused bleeding, and turned my skin raw and it seems to be getting worse not better. Im no novice dope user and im fairly certain im experiencing an allergic reaction to the cut in the dope but diagnosing the cause is not my problem its stopping it. So please sound off with any and all help.

It’s entirely my fault and I admit it, I destroyed the marriage and i’m the only one who is to blame. I’m basically a dickhead, an asshole and impossible to get along with, and every time I try to change my ways I fail completely.

She’s taken our son with her and I doubt i’ll ever be able to see either of them again. It’s definitely a permanent break up there’s no coming back from. I love him so much and i’ll never see him again, I know that she will make sure of that. I can’t imagine i’ll ever find someone to love like that again and my kid has been taken out of my life forever.

All I can feel is this unescapable and acute sensation of loneliness that permeates every fiber of my being. I’m so unhappy i’m basically just lying in bed shaking with misery. I thought about suicide a lot but I lack the guts to kill myself, so i’ve decided to become a Heroin addict instead. It seems like the next best thing if I can’t just directly end it all because at least if I start doing Heroin every day I won’t have to feel like this while i’m on it.

I’ve got a few hundred thousand in savings and a decent stream of income from some investments,  so I went to one of those internet places and ordered a couple of ounces of heroin from a vendor with great reviews. There’s a needle place in my city where I can get free syringes and all the equipment I need, there’s also supervised injecting rooms. I’m not super rich but I have a safe enough income stream and savings that I will be able to support a habit for the long foreseeable future.

I’ve never tried Heroin before but now seems like a great time to start. I’ll literally do anything to stop having to think about her and my son. My only experience with drugs is weed before, but i’m ready to step in to the big leagues now.

Can someone give me a run down of where to start and how to do this properly? How do I prepare the dosage and inject it? How do I make sure I don’t have Fentanyl or other dangerous stuff?

I just started getting pretty addicted to TAR (IE heroine from MEX). I mostly snort cheese (crush tylon PMs and tar mix into a power). I probably snort 10-20 dollar amount per day and started about 3 weeks ago. I feel ok, haven't really gotten sick but I always worry all the time that things will turn to shit . Even though I doheroine everyday I am still able to work full time just fine and I even have a second job on the weekends. I can also drive and function just fine. I do have access to subonxens which is what i plan to use when I decide to get off of it. The pain/withdrawls of getting off of it is what i fear and why I am not getting off of it any time soon. I guess my question do some of you or do you know people who are able to function just fine while doign and being addicted to heroine?  I am currently spending an additional 200-400 a month on this drug.

The reason I ask is because all the people I met who are also heroine addicts well their life sucks and you can tell right away they are drug users. Thats what I fear the very most. I am afraid to really fuck up my life. I don't have a super badass career but I make decent money and have a clean record. I don't have to support anyone (well except a few friends who stay with me because they don't ever have money. They are the ones who started to get me to do it actually). My roommates I whould call them are more than 10 years younger than me.  They have stayed at my place in and out and have never stolen from me. One of them ""has"" to do at least 50$ per day in drugs. Of course the chick lets me have sex with her and who wouldn't want to bang a 21 year old semi hot looking pretty chick.

I was wondering what the bioavailability of an insufflated drug would be when experiencing a bloody nose.  

Now the type of bloody nose I am referring to is one that isn't actively bleeding, but when I blow it, a little blood comes out into the tissue and if I stick my finger up there I get a little blood on my finger only in the spot of where the sore is.  This is usually in the mornings but after my last dose I am noticing it again.  There isn't a scab or anything covering the sore because when I put my (sanitized) finger up there I can feel where the sore is and I get blood on my finger in that spot only.  I was curious if the bioavailability would be greater because not only is there not enough blood to prevent contact with the mucous membrane, but there is also an open sore through which the drugs (specifically heroin in my case) can enter my bloodstream.

I researched a little and found [this](http://intranasal.net/overview/default.htm) which briefly says ""Finally, if the patient has a bloody nose or large volumes of mucous production, the applied medication is either washed off, or has trouble gaining contact with the nasal mucosa and cannot be absorbed"".  As previously stated, there really is very little blood and it isn't actively bleeding so I don't think it is interfering with the drug gaining contact with the nasal mucosa. There is no scab to interfere with gaining contact either at the moment as mentioned earlier.

I was going to post this in r/drugs but that sub is shit now and I figured i'd get comments from 15 year olds telling me i'm a fuck up and should take better care of my nose rather than answer my damn question. I use a netty pot as well as aquaphor at night when my nose gets dry or after a long night of drug abuse, so I am well aware of and practice adequate nasal hygiene. You guys might give me an actual response so here I am, but I digress.  Thanks for any insight/personal anecdotes/whateverthefuckelse you guys can provide.

TL;DR If I have a slight bloody nose and insufflate heroin will the bioavailability increase because it is going directly into my blood stream through the sore, or would it be less because of blood preventing contact with mucous membrane and/or other shit i'm neglecting to consider?",1475803450.0

Well, they did ask for a sample today and after taking it I told the PA that works with me that I took hydos yesterday because I got out the last of a bottle given to me by another doctor before I went to this clinic.  That part is true and he said I was violating my contract with them but it also gave us a chance to discuss that the tramadol doesn't work for me so he was nice and noted my taking the Vicodin and switched my presentation from tramadol to hydrocodone.  What I didn't mention was that I took some oxy over the weekend and smoked weed about a week ago.  I'm not sure if those will show up on the test or not but I do have a prescription for Percocet from spring and if nessesary I'll tell him I took the last of them because I was in pain.

I kept a very good routine. Friday was my special day, my 'me day'. The evening before I'd clean my room and get everything ready. After work on Friday (I'd hate it when I had to work late because it meant I skipped the week), I'd pickup a takeaway and take my dose (which was exceedingly small back then) then chill out all evening watching a DVD and stuffing my face with food. I'd get such a good night's sleep, and felt fantastic on the Saturday. I kept this up for a good 8 months. 

Then I slipped. Why not have a day like this during the week? For some reason it just never crossed my mind to do it more than once a week. So I added in an extra day in the week, then two, etc. It got to the stage where it became an every other day routine (doubling up on my using days, morning before work and evening after work). It got pretty bad 2-3 months ago when I tried to stick to this 'every other day rule' as it ended up becoming Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday (my semi-off day where I'd take a small dose just to keep the WDs away), Thursday, Friday and Saturday. My off days were gruelling. I'd only make it through the off days with lope, 400mg of modafini and an equal amount of caffeine (that was just enough to keep my eyes open, the fatigue was by far the worst).

I should mention the main reason why my habit turned into more than once a day. I work in finance and do plenty of late nights (at worst I'm doing 80-100 hour weeks), normally its around 50-60 hours a week. Pills give me an extra boost, way more than caffeine does. Don't get me wrong, I still get the nod but its a perfect combination of calm, focus and energy. And I can always make it work for my environment. Do I want to go out? Great, pop some pills and you'll be super social! Can't sleep? Pop some pills and you'll go straight to bed. Need to get that shit task finished? Pop some pills and you'll be great. Its an 'everything solution' for me. I love the versatility. My slowest weeks at work are the ones where I'm doing a straight 9-6 with no pressure. These are the days where I need pills the most (odd, I know). If I'm full out under pressure, I can run on the adrenaline alone.

I've tried to quit for a few reasons. In no particular order (but this was the order they came in my head, so take it for what its worth). First, sourcing has become a pain. Its just an absolute ball ache. Second, I hate being dependent on something just to get through the day. Further, the thought of being away from home on emergency without any access and experiencing WDs without preparing is exceedingly terrifying. Third, I started to become emotionless. I've stopped caring about things I want and should care about.Fourth, I want to go back to when it was just a special treat. 

I've tried quitting a total of about 2 or 3 times. The first time I tried quitting via kratom but that just ended up being pills one day, kratom the next, rinse and repeat. I also took too much kratom one day at an important event (think best friend's wedding) and couldn't even lift my head/open my eyes without throwing up. It was awful, but I had to play it off as being sick. So gave up on using Kratom as a mechanism to quit. I then decided I'd try quitting later. Next time I tried, I went two days and just relapsed because why not. 

I've had a few wakeup calls recently. Namely, my 'off days' were becoming my 'off day' and I was scared to death of a 2-3x a day everyday habit (as it was a 2x a day 6 day habit most recently). The biggest hurdle for quitting for me has been the fatigue. I can cope with everything else, but my job literally does not permit me a single off day. So going pure cold turkey is difficult to coordinate. That is to say, if I have days off from work or weekends free, why spend that in severe WDs? The past 2 weeks I've cut usage down drastically. I went the weekend opiate free to get the worst WDs out of the way. It was crippling. Making my bed was a task. It took all morning just to get the strength to get food. But I go through it. In the past 5 days alone I've used 1 day (but was 1/4 my normal). Today is the first day in the past year and a half where I've woken up and felt great w/o taking anything. I don't feel tired, headachy, brain fog, or any of that. No lope or moda. I just feel normal! Better than normal! 

I'm not trying to quit entirely--I'm just trying to go back to my once a week habit and I feel like I'm on the right path. Sorry for the wall of text. This has been very personal and not a single person knows so I've had no one to talk to about it in the past year when its gotten bad. I've lurked this subreddit and while I'm not as heavy a user as others, it doesn't change the fact that its still a struggle for me. This subreddit was also super helpful on my WD days (junkie jesus stories are hilarious! may you all be blessed by his love and kindness!).",1475784994.0

I was doing oxy daily around 30-60mg/day for 4-6 months, and after bingeing for a couple of days noticed I had finally become dependent. Tried to quit but lost it after three days.

First I planned to go to maintenance therapy, but once I realized here in Finland it would take at least 2 years before I could start, I decided to quit myself.

During a couple of weeks I dropped to 40mg with slight upset stomach, flu, anxiety etc. Then I started dropping it by 10mg/week, always bingeing around 80-100mg every THIRD day. 

Once I got to 20mg, I kept it there for one week with no bingeing, then 10mg one week and dropped off. With help of pregabalin and benzos, I only suffered from flu, diarrhea, yawning etc. 

However, I have pretty much no cravings or anxiety! I was in quite a good place in life though with new interests and hobbies to keep myself occupied.

It's been three weeks now. At first I binged every fourth day but abstained otherwise with slight physical symptoms. Then after every time I added one day until I indulged only once a week or even less. 

Physical symptoms are pretty much gone. Otherwise I am happy, but tolerance is still high... Maybe soon I can take a longer break. 

TLDR: If you want to stop daily use but keep using, try it and see how it goes. It is risky but it might work. I did not use daily for such along time, so I can only speak from my limited exerience, and of course relapse is always a possibility.",1475926024.0

I've also heard it grows mold like nothing else. Of course, I have never been able to hold onto any personal size batch of dope for even a fraction of the length of time needed to conduct an expiriment like this. 

However, I have unintentionally conducted a small scale expiriment of the like. It was about 5 months ago and I was at the typical depressing end to a nasty run with no money and nowhere to go amd found myself wandering around a shit podunk city that was lacking any substantial wooded areas, was well patrolled, well lit and disturbingly quiet after midnight. Oh and it happened to be unseasonably cold for late spring. The last lit bathroom was being locked up and I was being asked to leave. It was a particularly short run and I had no habit prior unless you consider 10g a day kratom a habit so I didn't have much of  a tolerance. As per my luck I find the best dope of the whole run the day my money runs out and score some really nice, organic, brown, relatively pure afghan dope, ECP, but not that fent shit. My tolerance was at that point where really good dope makes you vomit and I was at the point where just the sight of the dope in the cooker made me dry heave a little. With the bathroom closing, nowhere to go and too nauseous to prep a shot I was forced to hit the bricks with some dope left. My plan had been to commit myself at the local ER and I remembered for civil commitments they made you strip, put on those paper scrubs and collect your belongings (section 12 in mass). Frantic and tired I cram my last two smokes, rig, cooker, lighter and dope into a pack of L&M Red 100s and bury it in the mulch under the bushes adjacent to the hospital entrance. I convince the hospital staff to commit me and they assign my room guards for my own safety. The next morning they find a bed at a private pysch hospital and I am shipped off dopesick via stretcher and ambulance.  After 7 days on a locked unit I sign myself out and leave with Pucho, my suicidal Puerto Rican roommate who claims his uncle is an OG dope boy who he can have waiting at his tiny downtown loft when we get there and that I can stay as long as I want as long as I throw him a shot here and there. We do more coke than dope and after 5 days the money from my weekly unemployment check runs out early again and Pucho is acting pyschotic and scary. I leave with 2 suboxone and find a bed at a detox after one night in a Boston shelter. I stay for 6 days on 30mg peak methadone taper before being medically cleared to leave. My father and my wife have at this point given me some dire ultimatums so I agree to spend a very dopesick long weekend at our rickety little cape house. While in post memorial day cape cod traffic I dope-fiend my old man into driving me by the ER where I lied and told him they had kept my backpack. I instruct him to park around the corner and as soon as he is out of site I dive for the flower beds. Mulch and dirt fly everywhere as onlookers stare dumbfounded at me while I dig for that pack of cigs I buried almost a month prior. I find the pack!  Inside, it appeared as though the cigs had disintegrated leaving in the pack a glob of finely ground spongey tobacco. I hit the hospital bathroom and spill the contents onto the floor and dig out the rig, cooker, lighter and bag. Inside the untied bag is what looks like a little brown marble of playdo or chipless cookie dough.  A month old and wet I break off a chunk of it, drop it in the cooker, add water, stir and heat. I pull the crystal clear amber liquid into the rig and tap out the bubbles. Bang! Oh yeah baby, it was active alright and resulted in no cotton fever or histamine rash.",1475908251.0

How times have changed. Interesting article about drug use in Finland in the 20th Century,


Finland - a leading consumer of heroin from the 1930s to the 1950s


By Tommi Nieminen 

In 1936 Finland, the small republic led by President P.E. Svinhufvud, ranked first in a significant global statistic, higher even than Japan. 
In the two decades that followed, more heroin was used per capita in Finland than anywhere else in the world. 
In Northern Europe we were really the odd men out. Finnish heroin consumption was many times higher than that of Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Iceland - and just to put that into perspective, we are talking the combined figure of those four countries. 
Heroin was in the medicine cabinets of ordinary citizens all the way until the early 1950s - for instance, in the popular cough medicine Pulmo. 

It is no wonder that grandmother or grandfather never said anything about this. Heroin was a good medicine. 
“The wave of cocaine in Finland in the 1930s, and the amount of heroin consumption in the 1930s, was fairly new and surprising information for myself as well”, said historian Mikko Ylikangas at his office at the Academy of Finland in Sörnäinen. 
The 46-year-old Dr. Ylikangas is the programme director at the academy’s Intoxicants and Addiction research programme. On Wednesday, a book of his will be published. It is the first overall review of the use of hard drugs in Finland from the 19th century to the 1950s. 

For the book, Ylikangas dug through hospitals’ patient archives, as well as war archives, and the archives of various police units. 
What he found was a Finland of our grandparents - the Finland of the Civil War and Second World War generations - in which consumption of substances such as opium, morphine, and heroin was commonplace. 
There was recreational use of drugs as well, but very little. Pharmaceutical drugs were used, because times were hard. There was tuberculosis, insomnia, anxiety, and war. 
It could be said that Finland was drugged onto the world map.

There was much heroin, but it was a prescription drug. Ylikangas mentions three rational reasons why so much more heroin was used in Finland than in the rest of Europe. 
“Heroin was a good medicine for respiratory ailments - and Finland had plenty of them, in connection with a tuberculosis epidemic. Second, it was cheaper than other similar medicines, and third, the social problems linked with abuse of medicines had not got out of control in Finland.”
Heroin was a super-drug of the time of shortages. 
Medicines containing heroin were taken by both young and old alike. There were cheap heroin pills, and Pulmona, a cough medicine containing heroin, was consumed heavily, because tuberculosis was a health problem well into the 1950s. 
“Getting heroin was childishly simple”, Ylikangas says. “Its use could have got wildly out of hand, although there are fairly short traditions of abuse in Finland. In addition, the substance was contained in various types of mixtures, which were more difficult to abuse.” 

The rest of the world looked at Finland with amazement in the 1930s. 
The League of Nations, the predecessor of the UN, urged member states to give up heroin, but the Finland of Svinhufvud refused to do so. 
According to medical authorities and the Finnish Medical Association, heroin was a cheap medicine, and no reasons were seen to place restrictions on it. 
It could not be replaced by other substances. 
Therefore, both domestically-produced heroin and imported versions were used. 
Local pharmaceuticals firm Orion’s heroin tablets contained five myelograms of heroin. There was also Adapyrine from Sweden, Diffines from Germany, and Hemyphone from Switzerland. 

While the rest of the world started to ban hard drugs, Finland repeatedly went against the trend. 
After Finland joined the International Opium Treaty in 1936, wholesalers started hoarding goods intensely. Pharmacies filled their storerooms. The Ministry of Defence immediately ordered 1.5 kg. of heroin for its military pharmacies, and 5 kg. of cocaine. 
Nevertheless, abuse of heroin and cocaine remained minimal; from the 19th century through the 1950s, the number one drug of Finnish addicts was morphine. 

“There are long traditions in the abuse of morphine in Finland, and many were already hooked”, Ylikangas says. 
It was only during the war that the use of heroin went ballistic. 
But let’s not go to the front lines just yet. 

The writing of history is naturally always selective, and always more or less ideologically-based.
Schoolchildren are always told how Hannes Kolehmainen, Paavo Nurmi, Ville Ritola, and other athletes ""ran Finland onto the world map"" in the 1920s and at the Stockholm Olympics of 1912, before the country was even an independent entity. 
What has been bypassed is the extent to which the world’s first wave of cocaine-linked crime hit Finland in the 1920s. 
In the aftermath of the World War and the Russian Revolution, all kinds of emigrants were operating in Helsinki: Russian nobles and military officers who had lost their money and their power, spies, and smugglers. 
The economy was in terrible shape. There was no social security, so people had to find ways of making money. 
Some started dealing drugs. 

German pharmaceutical companies were on the verge of bankruptcy after the First World War. 
To get out of the economic crisis, they sold large amounts of cocaine and morphine to shady characters, who smuggled the goods to St. Petersburg, via Helsinki. There was demand, because there were huge numbers of addicts in the postwar Russia of V.I. Lenin.
“Domestic demand could be satisfied largely by buying it from pharmacies. Then people bought it directly from German ships in the harbour”, Ylikangas says. 
Some of the drugs transported on the Germany-St. Petersburg route stayed in Helsinki. Cocaine was available at prohibition era speakeasies, and under the table at restaurants.
“The activities were largely run by doormen. The product that was sold was powdered cocaine”, Ylikangas says. 

The drug business was no small matter even compared with today. 
In 1925, four kilos of cocaine were found in three police raids in Helsinki. 
This is as much as Finnish police and customs authorities seized in 1995-1999. 

In Helsinki, small-time drug barons were arrested, such as businessman Tahvo Käppi and a doctor, Kaarlo Kalske, both from Vyborg. They sold drugs by the kilo to Estonia. 
Doctors wrote prescriptions for the upper class and cultural figures; before the Winter and Continuation wars, addicts were mainly doctors, nurses, businessmen, artists, lawyers, teachers, and officers. 

It was the age of Finnish alcohol prohibition.
Cocaine, for instance, had not been banned.
According to a police report from 1928, drug addition looked like an upper class matter. 
Present at a cocaine orgy at the home of Colonel Wennerholm were “the colonel himself, J. Kauppinen, young cadets, and girls. The girls were fed cocaine in oranges and sweets. The base of the thumb was used as a cocaine pit, where cocaine was deposited to be sucked.”
Colonel Wennerholm would actually have been a perfect character for an American crime movie of the 1950s. 

Hitler invaded Poland in the autumn of 1939. Josef Stalin's Soviet Union occupied the Baltic States. 
Finland responded to the perceived threat of a major war. It began to stockpile hard drugs with vigour.
The Defence Forces signed a contract with the pharmaceutical company Orion, which committed itself to keeping an amount of raw opium in its stockpiles that was equivalent to 150 kilos of pure morphine.
Cocaine, heroin, and morphine were ordered by pharmacies. The medical section of the Defence Staff ordered 50 kilos of morphine and 35 kilos of heroin - enough to produce seven million 5-mg. heroin pills. 

The medical officers were still not satisfied: there was not enough of the hard stuff around.
Never mind, for relief was coming.
During the Winter War a ridiculous amount of drugs came to Finland. By the end of 1940, 1,511 kg. of opium alone was delivered to the military pharmacy in Helsinki. 
It was supplied mainly by the American Red Cross and the Swedish state. In December 1940 there were 117,000 heroin pills, 469,000 morphine pills, 917 kg. of opium and 351 kg. of morphine.
There was certainly plenty of stuff for the Continuation War, which broke out in the following year.

“It was an interesting time with respect to the substances”, recalls Erik E. Anttinen, Professor Emeritus of social psychiatry. 
Anttinen fought during the Winter War, the Continuation War, and the War of Lapland - first in the artillery and - after going to flight school - in the Finnish Air Force. 
“Substances qualifying as hard drugs were handed out surprisingly freely, in my opinion. If someone had a cough, he might get dozens of heroin tablets, because it was an efficient cough suppressant”, Anttinen recalls. 

Heroin was a wartime panacea, which was used for pain, cough, arthritis, and muscle aches. 
Medics carried two ampules of cocaine in their bags, in addition to four ampules of morphine, 30 opium tablets, and 30 heroin tablets. Those on the front line were issued a package of five heroin pills. 
Anttinen took heroin “a few times”. He recalls taking Pervitin (a methamphetamine produced by a Berlin pharmaceutical company) only once, in the summer of 1944, when he flew several combat missions a day in the Karelian Isthmus. 
Whoa! Methamphetamine in a plane?
“They did tell me that I shouldn’t take too much for a longer period of time”, Anttinen says. “I don’t recall that there would ever have been any plane accidents caused by taking too much Pervitin."" 

On the front line, strong medicine is needed, especially for the wounded and for commandos. 
All the same, Ylikangas was dumbstruck by the amounts of heroin that were consumed by the Finnish military. 
During the Continuation War, 7-9 million Antineralgin heroin pills were consumed annually. 
“To my knowledge, no country involved in a war had distributed heroin in such large amounts. The use of Pervitin was somewhat more selective”, Ylikangas says. 

The German army had sharply curtailed its use of Pervitin already in 1941 because the substance had led to unexpected problems. 
Soldiers experienced hallucinations. Some could not sleep, even though “it had been tested with German precision on both animals and people”, Ylikangas says. 
Germany unloaded some of its Pervitin stocks in Finland. According to a secret letter of the medical department of the Defence Staff in August 1941, 850,000 Pervitin tablets were stockpiled by the Finnish Defence Forces. 
In emergency situations, especially during the big Soviet offensive of 1944, they were used heavily - even by ordinary foot soldiers. 

The Continuation War actually quite equalised the use of drugs. 
On the front lines, small farmers and factory workers tried drugs that had previously been available only in Helsinki high society. Some got hooked. 
After the war, special forces soldiers told about their experiences in the press and in books. One of them recalled an escape that took weeks while under the influence of amphetamines. 
Another said that he had seen large buildings, dancing girls, and chandelliers on the front. One dispatch officer mistook snow-covered boulders for sheep. 

After the war, in 1946, Helsinki was a restless capital, with plenty of shady people and crime brought on by the war. 
There were nearly 15,000 break-ins during one year. There were divorces, violence, and a stumbling economy. Broken soldiers were institutionalised. 
Heroin, amphetamines, and morphine had flowed from the front lines onto the street market, and military pharmacies were bulging with the stuff. 
Heroin was used and sold in several cafes and restaurants in the cities. Groups of morphine users lurked in the park of Helsinki’s Old Church, outside the Church of St. Paul, and at the Hietaniemi cemetery. 

Erik E. Anttinen, who had experienced three wars, studied to be a doctor. 
In the summer of 1950 he was recruited to work at the Lapinlahti mental hospital in Helsinki. 
“There were addicts from around the country, because it was a clinic of the Medical School of the University of Helsinki. There were especially many abusers of opiates”, Anttinen recalls. 
“We tried to give them medicines that might be less addictive. We tried to listen to them and talk to them in order to ease the anxiety phase. Those people would sweat, and be in terrible pain.”

There were differing views on how many of the addicts had been wounded while on the front. 
Erkki Jokivartio estimated that at least 60 per cent of the heroin addicts had been wounded. Doctors Achilles Westling and Jaakko Riippa studied the cases of 108 addicts after the war. Of them the dependency of only 14 was caused by treatment that they received for injuries in action.
In police questioning in the early 1950s, the addicts themselves estimated their numbers at about 1,000.
That was two generations ago.
Much less heroin is being used now, but the abuse of other drugs is much more common. In 2005 an estimated 14,000-19,000 people were believed to be hooked on hard drugs. About half of them lived in Helsinki. Three out of four were hooked on amphetamines. 

As far away as UN headquarters in New York, people wondered how it was possible that Finland - a country of four million inhabitants - could consume as much heroin in one year in the late 1940s as other countries use on average in a quarter of a century. 
In 1946, for instance, 99 kg. of prescription heroin was consumed in Finland. 
Finland was not yet a member state of the UN. 
Perhaps that is why the response that New York got from Helsinki was somewhat cool. 
The message from Helsinki was Finland intended to continue using heroin, and in fact, it would need more than before - for reasons of public health. 
What defiance! After all, this was a country which in subsequent decades has always crawled in front of whatever centre of power that happened to be issuing orders. 

“That would probably not happen in Finland under the EU. Now directives are immediately implemented”, Ylikangas says. 
Under Paasikivi, Finland finally gave in. 
Finland wanted to join the UN. When heroin disappeared from the pharmacies in the early 1950s and the availability of morphine came under stricter control, addicts in Helsinki were in a panic. 
Some would break into pharmacies. Others would tour rural pharmacies, which would sell hard stuff to those saying that they were war invalids. 

Many doctors were also users. 
Dr. Ailo Huhtala said in 1955 that about one per cent of Finnish doctors were drug addicts. According to statistics of the Finnish Medical Association, there were 2,381 doctors in Finland. This means that if Huhtala’s estimate was anywhere near the truth, there were 20-30 drug-addicted doctors in Finland. 
“Among doctors there was always a tendency to try to deal with problems quietly among themselves”, Ylikangas says. “They were not hauled into police interrogations. At that time, those in high society were treated at home, or they were sent abroad for treatment.” 
Ilkka Taipale, doctor and veteran political activist, believes that some of the addicted doctors had been hooked on heroin already during the war. 
“One of the doctors who had been in drug rehab later became the director of the Hesperia Hospital.” 

Heroin disappeared in the 1950s. 
Drug addicts switched to Algidon, a prescription medicine similar to morphine.
“At first it was thought that it would not be addictive, but it was”, Anttinen says. 
Algidon is actually a very powerful drug. People would die from abusing it. There were at least eleven sure cases. Some of the addicts of the time might still be alive.
“I know of at least one Algidon addict of the 1950s who is still alive”, Ilkka Taipale says. 
He passes on an interview request, but there is no answer. 
This is a pity. The request is still open.

(Number 2 will shock you!!!)","These will be very simple and straightforward. Do this, and this shit stops tomorrow.

1. Make narcan available FREE to anyone who wants it at any time, and pair that with pamphlets and access to training for anyone who wants it.

2. Make codeine/promethazine cough syrup OTC through a pharmacist to anyone over the age of 21 who wants it, at any time, even without a medical reason.

3. Reschedule hydrocodone and oxycodone to CIII, unschedule Tramadol and codeine and make them OTC through a pharmacist, subject to a limit of 10 packages per month (1000mgs per package).

These will slow the deaths considerably, as people will have Narcan on hand immediately during OD's and the training to use it correctly, and the rescheduling of Hydro/Oxy and on-demand OTC Codeine/Tramadol will give people something to be able to do instead of dope or when the dope runs out. Also, doctors will again be able to prescribe hydrocodone and oxycodone whenever they feel it is warranted for pain patients and they will stop forcing legitimate pain patients to the streets.

4. Allow primary care physicians to prescribe Methadone or any other opiate for opiate addiction whenever they feel an addict requires or would benefit from it.

Again, this stops people going to the streets to get drugs. It's fairly simple, folks. If people don't have to go to the street to get drugs where the purity is all over the map and/or loaded with things that are not supposed to be there (elephant tranquilizers) people will stop dying. Period. Full stop. End of.

As heroin has become more abundant, reaching epidemic levels in some parts of the country, authorities say, it’s also gotten cheaper. Federal authorities estimated that the average price of a gram of heroin in 2012 was $465, though in recent years the drug has sold for much less in some parts of Minneapolis.

__--------_---__-----

Pretty sure it wasn't $465/g in 2012. In 2013 it was $150-200 for me, but some people certainly got it cheaper.

And much less in some parts? That makes it sound like its still $450 in most parts.

So today I feel awful. I drop my gf off at work, I grab a flashlight and look in my mouth and my tonsils are covered in white spots. Queue flashbacks to my childhood (was a strep throat carrier, usually dormant but every few weeks it would flare up again, and 23 allergies to boot--indigenous plants & pollens, cats, dogs, rodents, and strangely marsupials). 

So being in a horrific amount of pain at this point, both from literal physical pain, as well the pain of untreated anxiety (flagged for drug seeking behavior), I called to schedule an emergency doctors appointment. Nope, not today.

Doctors office computers are down, and they can't take anyone until tomorrow, when they are opened for a mere 4 hours. I decided it would be best for me to take some ibuprofen and hit up my friend for some opies, so maybe at the very least I could just pass out and sleep until tomorrow morning...

...Nope. He is out on vacation. Won't be back until ""I'll let you know."" And here I am, feeling absolutely horrible, with no current solution, just moping around wishing that I could at least grab some xanax so I could sleep it off until the morning. 


TLDR; Bacterial Infection in mouth, doctor cant see me until likely monday, friend with the opies is on vacation, I have 23 allergies, 19 of which are indigenous plants and pollens. 


Anyone else have absolutely horrible immune systems? What are your experiences?







EDIT: The reason why my gf was fine, is probably because she has a super immune system. Never takes antibiotics, or any sort of medication other than occasional ibuprofen and quality ganj.",1475868613.0

I've definitely cut down from what I was previously using so i'll make do with that until my subutex arrives.

Anyway, I was smoking UK #3 off of foil, and put the foil on my foot after a long drag.  Instantly it burned my foot so I kicked it off and it landed on my three middle fingers, heroin splattered all over the tops and around my nails.  It burned like hell and I could do nothing but blow on it until it cooled down. 

Tried picking the hardened heroin off my nails and skin to no avail,  so washed it off into the sink and tried to save the scraped off bits for a rainy day, even though they'll probably taste like skin now :/     The bits I managed to pick off brought a bit of skin off also and is now wounded and painful.

I would like to take it as a sign that I really need to quit, but my junkie brain is fighting against common sense. 

Sorry for the boring tale, just couldn't believe how god damned hot the melted H was! 

Has anyone else had any weird, freak injuries from using H ?

**Some of you might remember my tales from Appalachia from a few months ago. I've decided to just post some shit when shit gets weird.**

**Also note - for the purposes of this tale  dope=meth. Odd, I know, but H doesn't really have a good hold here. Only pills for some reason. So locally, meth is the universal ""dope""**

This is a chronological rundown starting with **literally last Sunday 10/2/2016**. Saturday as it reads below literally happened yesterday. This is basically a summary of the most recent week of my life. If anyone i know IRL reads this they would no doubt figure out who I am. Names have been changed to protect the guilty. 

**Sunday**

Overall quiet really. Same old. I'm trying to hustle up a few bucks for a blue. Neighbor (Moe) knocks at the door ~2pm, Moe is a drunk and also on that dope (meth, remember?). Moe asks to come inside, I reluctantly agree. Moe proceeds to tell me that he's drunk 2 fifths of whisky and a thirty pack of beer today. Oh, and done some dope. Because how the fuck else are you going to survive that? Oh, and he also broke the needle off in his arm when he did his shot. Nice. 


**Monday**

Overall quiet really. Same old. I'm trying to hustle up some money for a blue. Knock at the door - buddy from high school, Tommy. He says ""hey man, can I party here tonight? I'll give you some money, like, $50"" I immediately accept this offer (hustle complete!) Next thing I know I'm driving Tommy around to pick up some girls for his party. Later that night my other bedroom is packed with about 7 cranked up methheads with needles in their arms. Whatever, I got 3 free blues from the deal. 

**Tuesday**

Awaken to general sense of ""shit's not right."" I realise I've heard my bedroom door open several times already. Wut? I discover a blonde girl on my couch asking if she can keep her stuff at my place because she's homeless. Somehow, she's extremely hot (I'm desperate, apparently, lol), so I oblige. She piles a bunch of shit in my closet and promptly disappears. I then discover several key items are missing around my place, such as my razor, shaving cream, toothpaste, and two 12 packs of soda that were in the fridge. I shrug it off because those 3 blues more than cover the value of that shit. Also, I saved one of the blues for a wake-up so hustle complete!

**Wednesday**

Upon awakening I discover a paper plate with a note attached lying right beside my bed. The note is from the homeless girl, from here on out known as Brianne. The note basically says ""thanks,"" plus there's half a joint and 1mg Klonopin laying on the note. Score! 
By the evening I had gotten my hustle on and was chillin when Brianne reappears. She's super chatty/friendly/flirty (fucking dope, man) and my lonely ass self is eating it up. Somehow we end up on the subject of movies and when she discovers I haven't seen [certain movie] she insists that we watch it immediately. Asks to borrow my car to go get it. For some reason I say ""ok."" Apparently I like to live dangerously. Shockingly she disappears for just a few minutes and returns safely with the movie. By the time we get rid of the various riff-raff and distractions so we can watch the movie, it's like midnight. Within 30 minutes of starting the movie Brianne is asleep. Fuck. I let her sleep a while before waking her and offering to let her sleep in my bed. This eventually ends up with us both sleeping in my bed. Just sleeping though. Damn. 

**Thursday**

Brianne wakes me up asking me to take her to the rural health clinic for her parenting class  (she apparently has a son that's been taken by social services). I drop her off and go back home. She reappears about 1pm complaining of a headache and immediately disappears into my bedroom and is asleep within minutes. Whatever. I get my hustle on, but then I can't find any blues. What the fuck. Eventually I settle for 3 methadone 10mg about 8pm. I immediately do two of them - snorted, painful. I return to find Brianne still asleep (meth withdrawl symptoms I presume). I get a plate and bust up the other methadone and line it out. I wake Brianne and offer her the plate. She seems excited. Grabs the tooter and goes to snort almost immediately, before catching herself to say, ""wait, what is this?""

""Methadone. It's all I could find.""

""Oh, ok then,"" she says and proceeds to do the bigger of the two lines. I had planned to save the other line for myself but I cave and give it to her. I'm a softie. Now that Brianne is well we hang for a while. Basically lying in my bed chatting. She was born into money. Local family. I knew a lot of them. It turns out I had been at several parties that she was also at as far as a decade back. But her father had died from complications from alcohol abuse several years ago. She had then moved from just pills to eventually shooting meth and without her father to help her she had become homeless. She manages to score a shot for herself around 2am. We spend the rest of the night hugged tightly in a spooning position. For some reason it makes me ecstatic. 

**Friday**

I wake up sick. Knowing my prospects for a hustle today are shitty I'm reluctant to rise. Brianne gets up and I assume she is going to her parenting class again. I walk to the kitchen about 30 minutes later to find her splayed on the couch. Says she just could'nt do it today. I tell her I'm sick and going back to bed too. She says she'll see what she can do. About 2 hours later she wakes me up and has half a suboxone. We split it. Later that afternoon she apparently gets well and disappears. Ok. I manage to hustle up enough money for one more methadone. I save half for Brianne. I find out that my main connect on blues was served with an indictment warrant about 6pm. Oh fuck. Brianne doesn't return. Where the fuck is she? I check the local jail inmate list. Nothing. Hmm. 

**Saturday**

I didn't sleep well because of Brianne. I still have her half a methadone. I get up about 9:30am hoping to find her in the trailer. Nothing. Depression. I catch myself watching the door nervously. I finally say fuck it and go lay back down. Within minutes I hear footsteps and Brianne appears. She says she needs to take all her stuff somewhere for a made-up sounding reason. Ok. I talk to her a sec and give her the half a methadone as she hurries out the door. Damn. I have to go to a funeral in the afternoon and I am not well. Fuck. Why is Brianne leaving? Where's she going? Fuck. Goddamn I'm gonna miss her. Someone at the funeral tells me I look ""mad."" No milligrams for me today. Goddamn I'm gonna miss her.

*Edit: Extra from yesterday that I added in a reply below.*

**Saturday (con't)**


About dark I'm standing looking out my front door smoking a cig. I see two cop cars pull up over by Moe's. Interesting. Three cops emerge and head straight for his trailer. Now I'm rubbernecking to see what's up. A few minutes later I see them lead Moe out. No handcuffs but they put him in the back of a cruiser. They seem to be about to leave when something else gets their attention. Suddenly I hear fast footsteps and some guy in a red wifebeater bolts past my porch, two cops in pursuit. He gives up when he reaches the main street and can't cross safely without slowing down. The cops lead him back in 'cuffs. Shockingly gentle arrest though considering dude ran. 

I check the jail inmate list about an hour later to see what's up with Moe. Only says ""serving warrant for other agency"" on his booking. After a quick pow-wow with some other rubberneckers in the trailer park, I find out that they believe he was arrested for rape. Wow.

-I don't want an abscess. I know that when you use BTH it can be difficult to tell when you're ""in."" I was thinking about turning it into gunpowder to make it easier. If I make it into gunpowder, will I lose any dope? 


-How do tar tracks compare to ECP tracks? I've heard that tar is harder on the veins than ECP. If I use a fresh needle every time, what am I in for as far as track marks? It's worth mentioning that I'm gonna be doing some speedballs this weekend too, and I know that coke has a tendency to mangle your arms when you shoot it.

I wanted to try smoking a point or two of BTH at the end of the night (around 6 or 7 in the morning) just for the ritual.

(Please read before you judge)","I don't know much about the true struggles of opiate addicts, but I have never been addicted to drugs or opiates of any kind.

I recently go my wisdom teeth removed however and definitely notice the buzz I get from taking the 5mg hydros. I understand their class of drug and the reason they cause a euphoria. 

Here's the deal, is it fine do you think if I just maybe take 3 tonight and maybe one other night then flush them? I just want to see what the feeling is like because I understand that people get high off of them.

I have used LSD, mdma, amphetamines, cocaine, and other drugs in the past and have never had problems with them. I generally don't do drugs often and only use when I go to concerts, but the thought that I have never tried opiates, I just want to see what it feels like.

I get that if I HAD a regular connections + friends who participated in opiate use I would be much more likely to want to use more and eventually use more..

So do you all think anything is wrong with this? Simply due to the fact the prescription is limited, and like I said no one I know uses opiates and I don't plan on going out looking for more when the script runs out.

I live a healthy, productive, fitness oriented life, therefore it's not like I'm doing this to self medicate, I just want to see the feeling, or else the curiosity will cause me to want to do it illegally eventually anyways, I figure may as well try it now!

Maybe I'm just overthinking all of this haha. Can't be too careful with an extremely potent gateway drug to heroin though.

I have never posted here before but need some help and advice from the wealth of experience ou there, some guiding light to see me through this dark. Please help me! There are good men and women out there, brothers and sisters in arms, that I hope will read this. I'm shivering from the idea of Precipitated Withdraws!!

Overview:
I have been snorting about one 40mg Opana (Orange) a Day for the past 3 weeks. I have been on Suboxone for 2 years and had the hardest time tapering of 4mgs of Suboxone. My stupid mind or drug addict mind decided that I've handled withdrawals before on ""bad"" pills before and should switch to that instead of Subxone to tapper. It's blew up in my face! Or nose to be more exact! Now I need to go back safely to Subs and reclaim my life. I need help for tonight when I will begin my withdrawal back to Suboxone without Precipitated Withdraws.

Brief Medical History:
I have deep depression and very bad anxiety that I take Lexapro and Klonopin for daily. Getting off my Subs was such a horrible mistakes, causing these 2hrs windows of almost suicidal thoughts and sleeplesssness that my boss for my demanding job has taken notice knowing my past. I'm a wreck Friends. My anxiety has always made the withdrawal far worse than anyone I've known, more intense than a person doing the same doses as me while we descended into hell together. The anxiety always either creates or perpetuates symptoms far worse leaving me cowaring now even before the pledge has begun. 

Proposed Plan:
It's 5pm and I did my last of my Opana which has a 24-36 wait time for taking a Suboxone according to common charts. I am going to start taking perc or hydro as I start feeling bad later. When it reaches after midnight or so, I'm a going to make use of a sleep aid (ambien) and Valium if I wake up. The charts say I only need to wait 12hrs minimal for percs and hydro out of my system to take my first Sub. Along with the sleep aid, I am going to do all the normal obvious preparation of hydration, etc. Anything I missed that's amazingly important??!

Concerns and Questions:
Any flaws in this plans? Everyone is different so it helps to here from a group than a label. I'm so nervous I'm second guessing even the smallest thing I know has been true for me just because of Precipitated Withdraws. I want to take Loperamide but is it a slight opiate that could make me go into Precipitated Withdraws? I want to try Kratom but it may be the same thing. I'm so so scared Friends. ANY miracle aid that I have not though of to get me through this ""12hrs"", which for my anxiety feels like a suicidal week. My anxiety has hindered my recovery so much that you guys must think I am a weak child. 

My mother takes care of my severely disabled father and brother but using some time to sit with me tonight and tomorrow. I need to get back on Suboxone and help my whole family. Help me fix my life so I can be there for my family please. Please!! I'm so scared.",1475966160.0

Usually taking half of a 10/325 per day just to get through the worst pain in the evening. I have gone off cold turkey several times with no issues beyond minor achy, stuffy nose and loose stools for a week with maybe some depression for a couple of weeks after.

I am on Day 7 of stopping after a 6 month stretch as I start to feel worse after too long on opiates, but the symptoms are different than the other times and don't seem to be improving but rather worsening. My face/head feels very weird, sort of dizzy/foggy/tingly. Bending over makes me nauseous and feeling like I will pass out. It seems to get worse once I get out of bed and start doing things. Tightness/ticklish tingling in face/neck/chest/legs/back. Hot flashes come and go. Legs are weak when I first get up and I feel like I will fall down. 

Is any of this normal given such a low dosage? It's so different than every other cycle I am worried. Usually by this time I'd be on the uphill. The only thing that seems to help at all is Ambien which I take for sleep. Activity doesn't really improve it like normal. I am eating and hydrating well. I have a calendar up and am waiting for 2 weeks and then 30 days just to see if things are any better at set times but as bad as this is compared to normal I am very frustrated.

So I used a combination of smack, Meth, and benzos intravenously for about a year, been clean (suboxone maintenance) for 1.5 years. 

I would describe my memory of my period of drug use as a hazy dream. There are solid months which are completely black for me, and a few sharp incidents of memory. That really doesn't surprise me considering the combination of drugs and pattern of use (shot up about 650 times within 6 months). 

What does surprise me is the continued short term memory problems since starting maintenance. I'm on .25mg/day, which is pretty damn low according to my doc. And yet I still have major memory gaps. 

eg) I recently saw a coworker (with whom I'd worked with daily and even hung out with socially for about 5 months). When I saw him, there was not a hint of recognition in my head, yet he was acting like we were old friends (my gf has confirmed that I should definitely know him) 

That is just one of many such occurrences along with general dissociation from events more than 6 weeks old or so.

Just goes to show that there really isn't that many good people with genuine human kindness, or just common fucking courtesy anymore; particularly in our little section of society.

So what had happened was I let my dboy use my phone to talk to a buddy of mine about some money, but as the conversation progressed he began to walk back towards his little alleyway or whatever and so I followed him only to realize that he was getting into a car that had 3 other people in it and as I tried to insert my body between his closing door, they drove away down the alley way.

Now, I finally managed to have the service on it suspended but I am unable to do a remote data wipe because I have Find My iPhone turned off. However, in the time it took me to get all that done, he had the gall to attempt to hit me up by calling my buddy, hit up my buddy, and worst of all; hit up my girlfriend trying to use my phone as a hostage. Stupid asshole was asking for $300 for my cracked and well broken in iPhone 6s. That now has no cell signal. What the fuck, man. I wasn't even supposed to really be a part of that bullshit, I was just calling my buddy to see what was up with the money situation for the dilaudid we were trying to cop.

56p5ej,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/56p5ej/my_first_fentanyl_experience/,3,https://redd.it/56p5ej,JustAnotherSlip,My first Fentanyl experience.,"My first fentanyl experience was earlier this year and did not occur by choice. I had been clean off heroin/oxycodone for about 9 months at the time, and was on a daily dose of prescribed Suboxone. However one day I had a friend ring me up telling me that he had been getting some really good shit out in Los Angeles called ""China White"". I had definitely heard that name China White one time before, in reference to really pure heroin, and was thinking that finally the Mexicans have stepped their production game up and have graduated to synthesizing pure #4 heroin. My friend is super knowledgeable in the LA dope scene so I trust his recommendation. Before we got off the phone he tells me ""This stuff is not like normal black tar heroin, so if I ship it to you please please be very careful."" My response? All I'm thinking is, ""Ummm SHIP THAT SHIT PRIORITY EXPRESS, SIR!"" Yummy!

The package arrives 2 days later in the mail. It's a grey powder with lots of small rocks. It's not really white as implied by the name China White, but hey it's OK, I've heard of gray H before. In fact many people say Gray-colored H is the best.

I dip my nose into the bag to smell that vinegary goodness. Hmmm. It doesn't smell like vinegar at all. In fact it really doesn't have a smell. This is when I start to think something is fishy and that what I have been sold may not in fact be heroin. At this point I'm not even remotely thinking of fentanyl, I'm just thinking maybe its bunk stuff. For some reason I tell myself to start with a small hit just to find out what the hell this stuff really is.

I put the tiniest piece of a crumb on the foil, just as a test dose. I put the lighter under the foil and inhale the chemical-tasting vapors.

I immediately experience a dizziness that only someone who has smoked fent can understand. It's not like I'm going to fall over but the vapors produced quite the head rush. ""Okay,"" I'm thinking to myself, ""here comes the huge high. This is gonna be some good dope.""

5 minutes pass. No euphoria, no good feelings. Just heavier eyelids and mild sedation. ""Okay maybe I didn't do enough, let's put a bigger piece on the foil.""

I take a huge hit this time, enough to fill my entire lungs full of this mystery chemical. I exhale the fentanyl-laced vapors out. Before I can completely exhale, I experience even more dizziness and a bigger head rush results. ""Okay now here comes the big high, I just needed to smoke more.""

10 minutes pass. At this point there is still very little euphoria and it has become a fight to keep my eyes open. My whole body is itching, and my pupils are completely pinpoint. The tiredness is overwhelming. ""I need to lie down."" I go from my chair to my bed and tell myself ""I just need a few minutes.""

90 minutes later I wake up. ""Well that was weird. The subs must still be blocking the euphoric parts of the heroin. Let's try a little bit more.""

As I'm reaching into the bag I notice that the rock I put on the foil still isn't finished. ""WTF!? My tolerance is that low!?"" I proceed to take another huge hit and finish off what's on the foil.

Another headrush occurs. At this point my whole body is itching and itching but no matter how much I scratch I can't seem to get relief. Still no euphoria, and once again I'm fighting to stay awake. 

It is at this point, about 3 hours after receiving the package that I call up my friend and say ""WTF is this stuff man? This isn't heroin.""

He tells me ""Nah man, it's China White. I told you that. Did you do too much?""

I shout back through the phone, ""WTF is China White!? What the hell is in this stuff!?""

""Idk man. But it's not heroin. I told you that. The only heroin in California is black tar, you know that.""

I hang up the phone. I type into google ""China White"" and start reading about it.

At this point I find out that what China White usually is, is a fentanyl-containing product, or fent-analogue. 

I proceed to shit my pants and curse my friend for his callousness in the matter. He knows I don't IV my drugs, but it had been about 9 months since I had seen him. What if I started IV'ing since then? I wouldn't be here to tell you the tale of the first time I did fentanyl.",1476058598.0

In Jan 2016 I started doing 15mgs of oxy every night a few hours before i slept, barely able to keep my eyes open and going into bed was the best feeling ever. Before this I have experimented with oxy in the past, but once every few months taking a half blue as it would make me nauseous but the sleep was well worth it. From jan to march I did a half blue (15mg) every night and decided to stop. I got kind of sick, but it wasn't as intense as I had heard. (i have a herniated disc in my neck so that can add to pain/discomfort) I also started taking immodium soon to notice that i barely had any withdrawal symptoms, my biggest problem was not being able to sleep.

After 2-3 weeks of immodium and non-opiates i decided to go back to it, starting again early april at a half and working my way up to 3 a day all the way through my university graduation (may) I started not having the money to keep doing 3 a day so ive worked myself down to 1-1.5 a day. I prefer to do 1.5 so i can ""nod out"" when i go to bed, but 1 is good enough sometimes depending on the time. I normally wake up around 12/1 and dont take any doses till 7/8 PM and then take the majority of my dose at 11pm/midnight to go to bed around 2. 

If i am tight on money, how should i stop? tapering doesnt work for me, i just always fuck it up. I can probably get down to 1 a day at best but i dont think Ill be able to do a half a day. Would cold turkey really kill me? with immodium, xanax, muscle relaxers (prescribed) naproxen (prescribed) and other supplements/meds can i do this? Im mostly worried about my neck pain, cause I havent really felt the real severity of it since i started this. Any help is appreciated!! I love you all, im on this sub every night on my phone in my bed for hours just reading and scrolling. 

also, i have kicked a very bad xanax habit cold turkey as many said was impossible and have never really had desires or craving for xanax since, i also use to use xanax to not feel the nerve pain from my herniated disc.

Always very potent and got me faded. At this time the local police reported purity levels higher than any time in the past. My preferred ROA is snorting so of course I like the solid stuff better, as it is very easy to put it in a piece of paper and crush it into powder. Years ago when I would get moist dope (stuff you can squish with your finger, looks like play doh, and does not turn into powder) I could still chop this with a razor and still be able to get off on just a pile of small chunks snorted up my nose. 

At this time the stuff smelled of vinegar strongly, a smell that I associate with good dope. But now in the present time, I have been getting dope with many many sparkles in it. This happens with rocky solid chunks as well as the moist stuff I have just mentioned. It hardly ever smells like anything anymore, much less vinegar It burns so bad that I cannot take it anymore, it's impossible to get me to do this stuff. Even if it was good I wouldn't do it, but this is where my topic comes in. I've read that the sparkles could be cut glass, but I've also heard that sparkles could mean that the dope is almost pure. I know this is not the case because I just snorted a half gram of the stuff I received today and it just felt like I had taken a sleeping pill, no euphoria, no nodding out. 

My first question is, what were these sparkles? Second, there are obviously more than one type of dope with sparkles in it around here, 3 kinds that I have tried so far (about 10-15 times) and all of them give no euphoria or nod. Some don't even take my sick off. So I'm wondering do people make large batches of ""H"" that has no actual H in it? Lastly, I used to get the moist stuff I mentioned before about every 4 or 5 pick ups, now this stuff is all I can find. It upsets me because I'm forced to look for new dealers when I've already went through most of them in my town. The problem is that I live an hour away from where most of the dope comes from, so I'll make a call or send a text asking the guy if his product is ""hard"" or ""rocky"" and they'll say yes and tell me to drive down there. I have never had a dealer tell the truth and say his stuff is mushy. So every time I get down there with my hopes up I'd say 90% of the time the dealers have lied to me and what I just purchased is straight up mushy moist dope that is cut to shit. I don't have the willpower to say no after driving an hour and being excited about getting un-sick. So the final question is: Is there a way to turn the moist/squishy stuff into hard/rocky stuff or even to get it into snortable powder?

Also: how can I ask a dealer if I can see their product before buying it? Most of them get very very angry and tell me to either buy it without having seen it or get the fuck out. I don't even ask to test it, just SEE it and they get mad. I've had about 7 to 10 dealers in 4 years and they all seem to hate when I ask if their product is hard or squishy.

TL;DR: Most of the H I get is either mushy/moist or burns my nose to the point I cannot do it, is it because it has sparkles in it? Can I make the mushy dope into powder by changing the chemical makeup?",1476053397.0

I'm looking for ones that wouldn't be on a standard vein map since I've already looked at those. I'm 5'7, 120lb and was always told I had good veins; I have light skin and I can see them through it. But I spent the summer doing iv coke every day, which seems to have destroyed my veins and now I have a really hard time hitting.

I've only been using iv since Valentine's Day last year (a nice present/treat for the holiday) so I couldn't have possibly used them all. I've tried arms, top and palm of hands and feet, torso, boobs, heard guys have used their dicks so I even tried a vag vein once (didn't work) and my boobs. My biceps have visible veins but don't work, maybe I'm using wrong ones?

When I was in the hospital the first time this summer I was amazed at how fast they were able to find a vein in my arm for my iv and stuff, so of course I ruined those spots when I got out. I managed to ruin all my ivs while I was there too by retrieving the special iv syringe they use to saline-flush the tubes from the trash and using it to shoot speedballs through my iv, which was too hard on the veins combined with the antibiotics. So I think the forearms are shot but I haven't used them in months so I could try. I can't find any in my neck and I don't want to blindly guess since it's a dangerous area, and I don't want to do femoral because I don't have th right kind of syringes. I'm using my legs most right now so suggestions here would be best!

 I'm trying to use Oxycontin to taper off opiates.  I have a handful of 10mg quick-release, and a couple of boxes of 10mg OC long release. My Partner won't take them after his knee op so it seems ideal to use them to cut down while they're here and not costing me anything.  I don't mean to be smug about it, a few weeks ago this would have been a dream to have Oxy in the house, but I'm  really wanting to stop heroin so think it's best to reduce daily to minimise withdrawals and finally stop altogether.

My plan was to take 4 or 5 quick release a day (every 4-6 hours when withdrawal starts) and then gradually cut down the amount I take in a day rather than using the long release, as they don't seem to stop any withdrawals :(

My question is,  If I have been taking 10mg of the quick release,  and if I snap or cut the 10mg extended release,  will this harm me?   I know it's dangerous to snap extended release oxys, but if it says it's 10mg on the pack,  would that mean that only 10mg would be released all at once,  like taking a quick release? 

Or is there a higher amount in the pill but it releases slowly when the time release isn't broken?

Sorry if this is an idiotic question, I just don't know anything about time release pills, and was not sure if it's 10mg overall, or if there's a higher mg in the pill.

Thanks in advance for reading, really ready to quit now.  My subutex didn't arrive in time and ended up buying more heroin, and I didn't even enjoy using it :( ",1476042330.0

Anyways the point of this post is hoping that someone has some insight into what I ingested.

I have been clean for months but close to the last time I used I snorted a handful of bags from the same area in brick city that I always cop in. I almost always drink before I go so I had some shots of vodka and headed in to the hood. Anyways I snorted four or five bags and the come up for the high was the same as usual. Except about ten mins later I couldn't even walk in a straight line. Usually by the time I cop the drunkness has worn off due to nervousness and excitement so after ten mins of snorting I was stumbling around and for the life of me could barely walk. I actually had to take a time out to sit down for a few mins before I continued.

 It definitely wasn't the alcohol and I don't think it was fentynal either because there wasn't much euphoria and it lasted like an hour. All of my limbs felt heavy as hell and while I had pinned pupils and felt the dope to an extent it wasn't really even pleasurable. What do you think happened?!?

Nothing heaps strong but enough to pull me out of a seemingly worthless life.

When I lived in NZ I saw psychologists and doctors but it did not really go anywhere because I would relapse, the psychologists seemed to make things worse if anything especially when I was sober. It just felt like they had no answerers for me.

Since then I have moved to Japan to work and recently I reached out for help here, it was a bit shocking to see how they handle things differently, a lot more concern and urgency in their demeanor.

From what I have been told from professionals in both countries is that I am addicted not because of the drug itself but because I see no benefit in present or future. I had goals which I can no longer reach due to dire medical circumstances I would rather not get in to and so I need to work on myself as a person.

The difference here though is doctors are really no bullshit and will talk to you on your level rather than be concerned about legalities and formalities.

So I made a lot of progress here with myself but one thing that keeps echoing is that its been made pretty clear not to expect to be happy again.
At first it was hinted by a medical doctor but it was said 2 weeks ago by my psychologist in a very serious manner, he wasnt mincing words or meaning something else. It was obvious he had lead up to telling me this and waited while I was on the up but its making me look at things differently I dont know how I am suppose to want to be clean if for the past 5 years things have been going a lot better than the years leading up to it..

So I would like to know why people quit, did things actually end up better than right before they started?

Im not sure what the reasons are people quit but I have been lucky in a way because I have had no health issues, money issues or lifestyle issues from using and my tolerance doesnt go up very much, if it does I know to use in a new environment so I always seek out new and novel experiences to kind of give me the edge on physical addiction.

i've taken them twice and I'm not really sure if i'm using them as efficiently as I can.

First day i took 1 then took another maybe 30m later (both crushed up and mixed in water as I got impatient during CWE)

second day i took two at same time  (again mixed in water).

I definitely felt chilled out but it was pretty subtle. is this what I should expect? online it seems like many people who are opiate naive are satisfied with 10mg and can feel strong effects. Do i just need to adjust my expectations? Not necessarily looking to nod just want to know whats normal.

Because i dont have a source i'm trying to use these as best i can. If 20mg isnot having a strong effect should I just content myself with the subtle 10mg and stretch it out? Is it worth going higher?

I was hesitant to use 30  / 40mg as I dont have any tolerance or experience but I felt comfortable / normal on 20mg. Didn't really feel anything that I would have associated with oxy til i got into bed maybe 5 hours after ingesting.

also as an aside, is it worth it to do CWE with only 10-30mg or will i lose my ox? I dont really want to simultaneously CWE everything I have as that would be too tempting.

At first I thought ok, maybe his phone died. What a convenient time but shit happens. By Mon morning I said to myself ok, he can still redeem himself. Tues morning. Ok. I can admit it to myself. He took my money with the intention of not delivering.

I saw a very obvious shout for help from  the most well meaning little sister to help her brother. immediately I recognized that she's of course doing the best she can... but I truly believe you need to have lived this life, the ups and downs, and the things people who have never been hooked just can't imagine. 

so far I've made  just the first few chapters. when it's done I'll post it here before publishing. I want to hear an idea on each of the first 3 chapters.. and whatever thoughts you have on it. short stories relating to the chapter would help.. and I'll gladly have your username or whatever you want.. because I believe good ideas deserve recognition.

Chapter 1 is going to hit hard. I'm going to lay the bad and hard to read stuff right out there. I have hard stories but there's always a better one out there. anything you can send me like ""trying to get a vein and I'm sweating... spent an hour trying to get one... when I looked up the entire floor was a mess with blood... I just carefully clean it up. goes with the game... some shots will be harder to get that  others"" I want to grip those with absolutely no idea how to helped a love one get hooked into what may be happening to their loved one. I don't want made up stories... the closers to you they are... the better. I'm not writing a fiction, but like most help books you have to get a reader engaged immediately.

Chapter 2
basically speaking about how the addict is not happy after it becomes addiction... I'm sure most like me remember when the smallest but made me feel incredible... not a tylical chemical drug like most upper as an examl
ple.. sure you feel great.   if you know what I'm saying here I'd love to hear Ina response... opiates never struck me as chemically like ssri meds or even caffeine pills. Opiates feel the way you wish you could always feel. purely happy, energy... yet calm and very much useful to some people... especially those with severe anxiety disorders etc.  this chapter will set the stage for chapter 5... maybe 6. Again I'm not really writting here right now...just laying a foundation and honestly I've seen so many good stories and so much support come from this group... I know each and every one of you would want to help save someone... at the very least help a distressed significant other, father daughter, brother or whatever the case.

Chapter Three
I'm certain to get backlash here because I don't see it as a disease in the classical sense.. so I don't call it that. but when someone else does it TOTALLY get it. from both my education as a dope fiend who's used longer than  I'd care to be honest about... but also having a formal education and degrees in multiple fields including abnormal physiology.. there is so much study done on how addicts become as bad as they get. I want to explain to a concerned reader that this person they're worried about is still the person they love. They are still worth your time and love... just show love and try not to constantly make them feel guilty... that could drive a wedge between you. it's a disease in that it's a thinking disorder inside the mind. I'd like input on what are the things that drove you further than being a once in a while user... what escalated it. for me it was very reliable
all pain... but we all know it's not the only pain it hides.


I'll continue to add as I gather some first hand stories and you're never so good that someone else can't help you see something differently.  know that if you have a great story or point I missed out.  I add it along with whatever you'd like to be recognized by. once it's published anyone who contributed uses will get a free one and all the proper thanks. I'm not doing this for profit...

4mg of Xanax allows me 2 hours of sleep at the maximum.  It's usually between an hour to an hour and a half.  It's the only temporary escape I get.  The people who I've been talking to on whatsapp are doing a whole lot better than me.  I'm kinda jealous.  They're eating real food and going for runs and I barely have the energy to walk 2 flights of stairs to refill my huge bottle of water.

Anyway, another 5 more days of this bullshit and I should be about 90%, if past withdrawal sessions are any indication.  Hope you're all doing well and staying safe.  I'll check back in a few days hopefully with some better news.

About 5 years ago, I had a contract to install new workstations at the drive through of a bunch of CVS pharmacies near and around Kansas city. Of course, my eyes were immediately trying to locate where they kept all of the pain pills. Needless to say, I was disappointed to find out that they kept all schedule 2 drugs in a locked safe. However, at this time, hydrocodon was still a schedule 3 drug, so this was always on the shelves.

 I guess they didn't want it to be in the eyesight of customers, so it was always hidden on the back shelves. Most stores had a camera in the area, so these stores were definitely out of the question. However, to my surprise, many stores had many areas where it was obviously hidden from the cameras. So, these were the stores I looked the hardest. I had to do all of my searching nonchalantly since it would have been a huge read flag if the workers were actively scouting out the product. 

There were a couple of stores that had all of there hydrocodon in this perfect area. One in particular was a gold mine for any opiate junky. In this area were multiple HUGE bottles all every possible hydrocodon combination.....including liquid hydrocodon. Many of the bottles had been opened, so I was 95% confident that they had no way of knowing for sure the exact amount. But it was that 5% of uncertainty that I was struggling with. 

I had a mental war going on if I should grab one or not. I had it all planned out in my mind and I'm almost certain that I could have pulled it off. However, that 5% of uncertainty is what kept me from doing it.

I ended up not taking it and I've wondered since that moment if I would have gotten caught!!!",1476178284.0

It gets you high 100% , in jail each 8mg pill goes for 160$ Canadian . Depending on you opioid tolerance , iv seem the same guys over and over take as little as 2mg subox (snorted) and get so high there falling off there chair, and also puking there face off. Then some just get high a bit. The longer your off any opioid and then do subox the higher you get , and if you do smaller amounts (1-4mg) you'll get higher then if you do larger amounts (8-16mg) cause there's narcan in subox (which acts as a blocker) so u can't overdose on it. Also if your on any opioid and do subox together you'll instantly get sic.  So if your on h or any opioid I wouldn't do subox until you actually at least 24 hours free of any opioid . Yea So I'd say if your gonna do it , snort 1,2 mg to start I usually get the highest when I do that and my opioid tolerance is through the roof. 200-400mg morphine just to feel normal . Or 1-3gm h. If your not a opioid user and you snort 1mg or more of subox you get rECkED. And anytime iv done more then 6mg I get really bad itchs n can't sleep worth shit . Iv seen and heard people say they get sic coming off subox, me personally never did and I was on 8-16mg a day for 2 months(being on h a year directly before that) then went to the hole where I was subox free for 20 days and I was fine. Didn't feel sic at all. So it depends on the person /there tolerance and how much they do but subox def gets you high",1476177296.0
56x4in,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/56x4in/losing_control/,17,https://redd.it/56x4in,zrmthrowaway,Losing control,"Long backstory.

I first tried heroin on 19 September this year -- exactly three weeks and a day ago.

I'd been meaning to get it for a while now because I was curious. I'd never tried any opioids (except for tramadol, which sucked) before. I use other drugs on a somewhat regular basis: MDMA, cocaine, Xanax, speed. I have used LSD and some other psychedelics some 5 - 10 times, but generally don't anymore.

I don't really smoke weed nor drink alcohol.

That Monday, after work, I got home and tried heroin for the first time. It was #4. I used a 5mg micro spoon and scooped out around half-full. I insufflated that.

I waited 10 minutes and I wasn't sure if whatever I was feeling was just placebo, so I did another half-full scoop.

10 minutes later I was definitely feeling the effects. It was just so *nice*. I don't believe I need to go into platitudes about how it feels like here, but I'll say I fell in love immediately.

No drug had ever made me feel that way before. I also thought I'd never succumb, ESPECIALLY not from the first use.

I gradually told my immediate group of friends, one by one, that I had gotten heroin and I was trying it. They were curious and intrigued. Worried, too, but trusted that I knew myself. I continued to use every weekend until Friday. 10 - 15mg max.

Friday night a few friends came over and smoked up. I did heroin. I did more than normal and redosed twice throughout the night. I must have done a total of 35mg total.

I was nodding out and eventually I retired to my room to just be in the darkness and to listen to music. Some time later, my friends knocked on my door and they were all standing outside. My housemate demanded I hand over the heroin because they were all concerned I was losing control and overdoing it. He said he'd hand it back to me the next day, 100%.

I was taken aback. I started arguing (non-physical). I felt betrayed -- because I'd trusted them to tell them about it and they were now turning on me.

After about 10 minutes of back-and-forth, I handed over the heroin to them. I wasn't actually going to do anymore that night -- but I was annoyed that they didn't trust me to know myself. I felt betrayed. I felt as if I should have just kept it all a secret.

The next day, I asked for it back from my housemate. He spun up some story about it being missing, that one of my other friends had accidentally took it home with them. He said they'd be coming over in a while, and that I'd get it back then.

I was furious. I knew he was fucking with me. I went to a restaurant to have my lunch and I was sure they were going to have an intervention and that I was just going to say whatever to make them happy, and get my heroin back and never tell them anything about it again.

They did indeed have an intervention. They sat me down and I was incredibly defensive. I justified my use. I was sarcastic in my replies -- in that I mocked what they were all doing to/for me.

I was later told that my closest friend (whom I'd known for 15 years) stepped away sometime during the intervention because he was tearing up. I didn't realise this at the time.

Gradually, as they simply voiced out their concerns, I saw it in their eyes that I had truly fucked up. They simply said they didn't understand the drug at all but I was acting in a way that was worrying them greatly the previous night, so they just needed me to reassure them that this was going to be a one-time thing and that I was still in control and that I needed to tell them if I was slipping away.

In that moment, I was shown again that these people actually really gave a shit about me. I had forgotten that. Or more accurately, I never truly believed it.

I told them I would put it away and not do it anymore. I intended to not.

---

I relapsed sometime a week later.

A side note: all this is also around the time I had gotten to know this girl and had gone out with her a couple of times. I really liked her. She'd agreed to go on a short roadtrip the weekend with me, too. So, all things considered, life was actually going pretty alright -- I had no reason to use heroin whatsoever.

Long story short, we spent two nights some four hours away from the city. The first night she candyflipped -- I did heroin.

Up to this point, I'd never been in a relationship. I'd never even really dated anyone before.

I fell hard for this girl. She's 5 years my junior. I saw a lot of me in her. She was me, when I was her age. Jaded, cynical, lost. We shared a lot in common in character and family upbringing, etc.

We didn't do anything those two nights. We slept together -- in the most literal sense of that phrase. We cuddled. She fell asleep in my arms. Et cetera. But I never made a move, not so much as even initiate a kiss. I was afraid, I think. Inexperienced. I didn't want her to think I was in it just for sex.

I don't know love, but if you ask me now, I think what I'd felt those two nights for this girl was love -- love as *I* know it.

---

As I dropped her off on Monday evening after our roadtrip, I told her I'd see her on Wednesday/Thursday, because I took those two days off. We hugged a long while. I intended to kiss her then, but I hesitated and ruined the moment.

I texted her everyday. We never met up. She was always busy.

---

I couldn't take the uncertainty. I had to talk to her. I fell too hard, too fast. I know this now.

I botched it. Had I played it more cool and cared less, perhaps I wouldn't be in this position.

---

So, what happened yesterday: I was feeling extremely depressed and I fantasised shooting up. I was afraid of needles. I'd be on the verge of a panic attack when I had to get a shot or get blood taken from me.

But yesterday, during lunchtime, I bought a syringe, needles, cotton balls and alcohol swabs from a pharmacy near my office. And I daydreamed all day about going home and shooting up for the first time.

I had dinner, then I locked myself in the room and got ready. I won't bother going through the process, but I failed. I later counted 11 attempts to hit a vein -- but I never managed to. I kept drawing back air.

Eventually, when I gave up, I was lamenting it all. ""Such a failure -- I can't get anything right in life. I can't even hit a vein!"" I was ""crying"" -- but no tears fell.

I threw the rig all away, then emptied the rest of the heroin I had onto the mirror. All in all, there was about 25mg there. I insufflated it all.

---

She replied to a text I'd sent her earlier in the day. It was then I poured out my heart to her. I told her I was interested in being more than just acquaintances. That I wanted to date her for real. That I was telling her this because I needed closure. Then I apologised for being so dramatic.

I felt like a loser. I still do.

She replied an hour later -- saying unfortunately, she didn't share the same interest. *""I’m not saying I don’t like you, but I’m pretty sure you know what I mean""* -- in verbatim.

I said I understood. I asked her what all this meant to her. I asked her if I was just not her type.

She never replied. Half an hour later, I wrote a long message to her -- basically telling her she was the first person who'd made me feel that way and that I was sorry for putting her in such a position. That I thought we had something -- but perhaps I'd misread the signs/signals. Then I told her I'd miss her, and that I would not bother her anymore.

She never replied.

---

It was a difficult night. I was only half-asleep for most of the time. Opioid insomnia. I dreamt of her, too -- of all the what ifs.

I woke up in the morning for work. I sat in bed for a bit, feeling blank. Then I pulled back the curtains and I just stared into the distance, into the morning sun.

I lit up a cigarette. I still felt blank -- just devoid of emotion. But I also felt strangely...alive. I brought up my left forearm to view and surveyed the red marks all over -- and I tried to make sense of it all.

---

It's almost 5pm at work here. I wrote a personal post of this earlier today and realised that I am at rock bottom. I have accepted that I am currently quite depressed.

I texted that close friend of mine during lunchtime to tell him everything, too. About the girl and the failed attempts at shooting up. I told him to keep it to himself only. I don't want to have to deal with explaining and acting okay to everyone else. I told him I didn't need any advice -- that I just wanted him to listen. He listened.

---

One bright side to my story is that I tendered my resignation at my current company last week, and I'm currently serving one month's notice. I will be starting a new job at an acquaintance's startup next month, and it's actually a pretty good gig. I can foresee myself being extremely busy, and I feel like I really need that now.

I currently don't have anymore heroin. I probably won't be able to get anymore anytime soon, too. But I crave it so much. I'm in so much pain.

I don't know how to get through tonight.

What do I do, reddit? It's like I felt the most amazing highs in life, and then suffered the most severe of comedowns. I still can't believe that what I had with that girl is all just one-sided. I've been careful all my life with being vulnerable, with opening myself up, and I did just that with her -- and she destroyed me.

I want manly arms around me with a mixed scent of sweat and cologne while I weep. Pitiful. I know. Problem being I won't usually allow for myself to become that vulnerable. Not even with a friend. Who would designate themselves to be such a friend anyways?

Somehow I fell in love. It's been 8 years since I had my daughter and with the exception of my junkie boyfriend when I using, I haven't dated. My focus has been her.

Now my mind is consumed with this guy and my biggest fear is the reality that I'm not in control of anything anymore. We've been ""friends"" for 5 1/2 months. I want more and we've taken it there a few times and he always pulls back. I literally can't take this anymore. We meet Wednesday to discuss the possibility of not even being friends anymore. Although we've spent 2 days texting about Batman so I don't know. 

He insists I'm his best friend and he can't live without me. He prays with me. He drives all the way to my house just to hug me on days I really need it. He speaks about the beauty of my soul and the strength in my shoulders from carrying the weight of the world. He sparks a desire in me to change and strive for bigger things. He pulls an activist, a revolutionary out of me. He helps me see the world in ways I've never seen it.

I don't feel strong enough to be his friend. I'm in love with him. We had our first fight a couple days ago. I went full on Harley Quinn blowing his ass up with text messages. It's so not me to do that. I spent 2 weeks depressed in bed. My back hurts badly from falling at work. Missing work. Can't take pain pills. This is the first time I've had to feel, really feel heartbreak without drugs or a rebound codependent fucktard to fill the empty spot in my bed. I can't return to either of those coping ways and I'm so tired of crying and obsessing. 

This is the hardest thing I've faced in my sober 3 years and it hurts badly. When you're certain you have something only to find out its unrequited or not real....who wants to be that fool? I mean, really? Watch me ramble myself all the way into my next depressive state. I don't know why I'm posting here. I feel alone.

Over the weekend I became extremely ill to the point where I couldn't function and it was a little bit scary. I ended up having to wait out the weekend before I could get antibiotics. Keep in mind the doctor said my throat was a combination of several different viral infections on Saturday.

So I assume by monday I'll likely be better. Wrong. I woke up on Sunday with these clusters of red dots inside my throat, alongside my white tonsils, and my entire mouth and throat feel raw. Like when you scrape your knee and get raw skin. Everthing hurts. I end up grabbing some opiates from my friend so I could actually swallow food which felt infinitely more amazing than the opiates. Seriously, the joy of eaten after not being able to for a couple days is wondrous!

So monday rolls around and I'm sitting here waiting on my antibiotics playing Heroes of the Storm. I end up getting my antibiotics and taking the first dosage, and a couple of oxycodones so I could just relax and forget about my throat. Here is where things get weird.

I start feeling itchy and think ""Oh ok. Must be the oxycodone."" I keep playing my game until the itch gets way worse than its ever been before, and I notice these tiny red dots on my fingertips. I assume (never do that, folks) that I must have touched something I'm allergic to.

Around 10 minutes later my entire body is covered in red dots, which turn into a bumpy rash, and I feel like I got hit in the face by a professional boxer. ""Oh shit. The antibiotics."" 

I dizzily stumble out and call my mother (thank the heavens she wasn't busy/asleep/drinking margaritas), and she drives me to the E.R. At this point my chest is tight and my throat is starting to close up.

We hit every red light on the way there. When we arrive, I get to sit in a waiting room looking like I just bathed my body in chiggers and volatile chemicals. The doctor comes out and takes me back, takes my vital signs, and talks to me for a bit.

Turns out I'm allergic to that antibiotic, which I didn't need in the first place, because my doctor gave me the wrong antibiotic. In his actual words: ""Why would she give you that? It wouldn't do anything in this case, but give you side effects."" Awesome. 

So he prescribes me an H2 blocker, 50mg Benadryl twice a day (im hypersensitive to it probably just going to take half), and a mild steroid. I go home and realize I left my dog outside. I take a nap and when I wake up I realize I fell asleep in my bed, that I may have just infected with my sickness. 

Never Lucky.
And that explains my tattoo.
That I will be getting soon.






EDIT AND UPDATE: The medicine seems to be working, albeit slowly. The red bumps are still there so its weird. Guess I could start a thread on r/conspiracy about how I'm turning into a reptilian shapeshifter after coming in contact with a foreign material. Probably won't though. 

150mg of Benadryl a day is nuts. I feel wonked out of my mind already.",1476150490.0

Since then, we've put 15 or so people on Suboxone. Another 10 are close to receiving prescriptions - it's a process that takes a few days.

Today, a patient called - her significant other had died the night before from an overdose. She said the only reason she was still here is because we gotten her subs last week. She told me we're likely why she's still alive.

Not only that, her insurance was giving us a hard time about payment and I had to navigate that so she could get her prescription filled.

So here I am still somewhat new to this, helping someone in withdrawal, raw with grief, and so very frightened and frustrated by it all. 

Fixing that insurance piece and offering the small support I could over the phone was all I could do. But it made a difference. Maybe one of the first few times I really have in my life.

Just wanted to say that this is only the beginning, and that I am going to be here for everyone that I can. Those numbers - 15 people on Suboxone currently - are nothing compared to what our goals are as an addiction center.

But you have to take one step at a time. And help protect the people around you. Stay safe everyone.

EDIT: here it is.

October 10 2014

I was on the edge of nirvana. My whole life had been sculpted, refined, in the pursuit of one goal: Heroin. I loved it. I needed it. It woke me up. It kissed me goodnight. It was the side dish to every meal, the passenger to every commute. I worked so I had money to buy heroin. I had a laptop so I could find heroin. My car existed to take me to work and to pick up heroin. My friends were a carefully crafted network connecting me to heroin. My appearance was constructed to throw off those who would separate me from it. And right now, I had it.

All of my efforts were now justified. The family I’d abandoned. The savings I’d spent. The lies I’d spun. All of it and more would I do over and over just to feel that feeling which is no feeling at all. I had my sole purpose in my hand, the chase a game like no other.

She’d called me saying she was finally back in town and I could buy some candy if I wanted. We called it candy in all electronic communication so neither of us could directly incriminate the other. We always found other ways of hitting each other.

She was back in town after making the drive to SLC and back, and had a special souvenir for me. She wasn’t my preferred source, or even my backup. She was third on my list of friends. She was third because she was always late, even for a drug dealer. She was third because she only had tar, and I had developed a taste for the fine white powder that ran through the East Coast hubs. She was third because she charged more per gram than I had ever seen before.

My favorite source wouldn’t be available for several more weeks due to family issues. His East Coast Powder was to die for. You know when a junky says something is “to die for”, they mean it. You pull the plunger connected to the syringe connected to the needle connected to your vein connected to your brain, and it hit you like liquid gold flooding your consciousness. First, a slight pinch as the scarred and abused vein protested the increased pressure. Then a chill shoots up your spine, over your head and down your nose. The chill is just a flash, followed by the warmest, coziest little feeling. It’s like a rush of blood to your head, but far more pleasurable.

From there, who can say? ECP floats you to a place void of all worry, all pain, all bad things dissolve in its mighty grip. I don’t care to imagine what heaven is like. I know that it’s only a poor imitation of the bliss that a junky like me knows.

My second favorite was still out of town, making a pick up. He rarely brought enough back with him, usually smoking half of it on the way back. When he eventually got back, I’d usually clean him right out again. He was all too happy to take my money.

Tonight it had been the third rung on the ladder, the bronze medal in dope slinging, which came through for me. Good thing too because my knees already felt like spiky dildos on stilts, and she was my last resort. I imagine most of her customers came to her as a last resort.

Now back in my apartment (which existed only to house me and my heroin) I gingerly unwrapped the small black ball bound in a piece of a plastic grocery bag. Last week I’d dissolved my dope in water, only to spill it all over some news paper. No mistakes this time. My hands were surgeon steady as I dropped the little ball of tar into my usual spoon. The spoon was cliché but that for a reason. There is little else a junky is likely to have on hand which will do the job. Sometimes I used the concave bottom of a soda can, but I liked using a spoon.

A few units of distilled water into the mix, and a little heat from a lighter turned all the way down. Too much heat and the smack would degrade. Not enough and it would take several minutes to dissolve. Patience is not so easy when you’re on the brink of ecstacy. Finally I had produced a small puddle of murky brown liquid. Sometimes there were little bits of solids floating around in my brew, sometimes not. Regardless I never used a filter. Plugged capillaries were the least of my concerns when I was trying to get high.

Finally, I had a loaded gun and the will to use it. My syringe wasted no time filling with nearly a gram of rocky mountain brown, and even less time entering the vein running over my bicep. I could barely hit the veins in the crooks of my arms anymore; they were so swollen and scarred. 

A deep breath before pulling the trigger, and my veins sucked up that sweet liquid gold. The chill hit me hard. It hit me really hard, harder than I had ever felt. Some shots are better than others. In the moments following a particularly sharp rush, there is no space for rational thought. There is no “oh yeah”, no “I hope this doesn’t kill me”. There is no space to think “I should call someone.” The chill tore through my whole being, and before the warmth could envelop me, my world faded to black.

---------------------------

It was raining. The warm drops of water stung my chest as I reclined on my bed. I was naked, and it was raining on my bed.

Opening my eyes, my vision is filled with the twisted face that I knew so well. Lisa’s mouth managed to both agonize and delight in seeing my eyes crack open. She’d been beating on my chest and yelling for several minutes. I had no idea why she was here, how she’d gotten in, or anything else besides a foggy feeling of heaviness. 

Her face was streaked in tears which had dropped onto my face and chest. I couldn’t hear anything. While she must have been yelling, I heard the silence of space. Seeing my eyes flick open, she broke into a sob which consumed her. She had no room for rational thought. She’d thought I was dead, thought my heart wasn’t beating, thought my lungs were not filling. Now I was alive. 

I still couldn’t hear anything. She was trying to talk to me, but I was still climbing back out of the grave. The human brain boots up at roughly the same speed as a desktop computer. She was saying something. All I could make out from her mouth was “…what the fuck is wrong…” and “…you were dead…” She wasn’t wrong. In fact I was still dead. I’d been killing myself for months now, and forced her to watch. Now I was willing and able to put her through it all over again. Lisa loved broken things. I was the first broken thing that actually broke her.",1476140030.0

Since then I've become a rather seasoned opiate user, (hydrocodone, oxycodone, heroin, oxymorphone, hydromorphone) but my first experience with codeine is still one of the most euphoric things I've ever felt.

56stty,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/56stty/my_brother_is_going_down_hill_i_need_help/,80,https://redd.it/56stty,mothfroth,"my brother is going down hill, i need help","so i don't use. i've tried heroin a few times years ago, but my poison was always alcohol (sober 1.5 years). my brother, on the other hand, has been an opiate boy for years and years. he reached his lowest point (packing a lip with fent slices every day) back when i was in high school and too young to be comfortable taking action, but old enough to be scared and to tell him i wanted him to stop. after his fentanyl buddy died in his sleep, my brother quit cold turkey. he was sick for months and shit water for over a year. but he told me during that time that he felt like he was exiting a heavy fog and could breathe for the first time in years. that made me really happy. something in him definitely changed then. 

about a year later, he was spending more time in the city i had moved to. at this point, he had begun to do little bits of heroin. he would buy 1 fold a few times a year and stretch it out over the course of a few days, then spend 2 days recovering. it didn't interfere with his daily life, though back then his daily life was not very structured as it is. when he moved to my city for good, his use went down as he had gotten away from a lot of the old using friends in our hometown. 

for the next couple years he did it probably 2x a year. but, the recoveries were longer and caused him to be more grumpy, antisocial, and isolated. one year, my mom came for xmas and he was dopesick the whole time and was a huge asshole and never hung out with the family. i found out AFTER xmas that he was dopesick. that was the first time he had hidden it from me. after that, he claims to be the second time he decided to be done for good. obviously, that did not happen. 

since then (2 years ago), his use has slowly increased to maybe 5x a year (maybe more, since he lies more). his recovery periods have gotten longer and more grumpy, they cause him to miss work as he has steady work these days. i was never happy about this and i told him so, but because he had always maintained such control and restraint and has never been the kind to get to a nodding level (doesn't find it fun, likes to take a little and get creative), i stupidly thought he could take care of himself and reach a point of quitting forever on his own. plus, he's always been super against needles, so the likelihood of OD is not as bad. i even protected him from people who said he had a problem. since his use is not typical (not a ""junkie""), when people would talk about him using heroin i always got really mad and defensive because they don't KNOW him. i know him better than anybody and i couldn't stand people judging him based on unformed ideas about his drug use. i even lied to my boyfriend about it and would get angry at him for bringing it up. i now know how stupid that was. 

clearly, something has since happened. on thursday, i got a call at 7AM from my brother's annoying friend. he's annoying because he is often fucked up (on booze and ketamine, not H) and he's not very bright, likes to rap a lot (he's awful), just turned 40 and still hits on my 24 year old friends, etc. but he really cares about my brother and has a good heart under all that jazz. he was very obviously blown out of his mind and hadn't slept, he was rambling on about how my brother is nearing the end and needs help and has been asleep for a whole week and can't walk and how worried he is. however, this was all interspersed between rapping, talking about his new bike design, talking about his niece, and other unrelated stuff. i wasn't sure how seriously to take him, but i figured my brother had bought another couple folds and he was worried. i texted my brother about it and went to work. 

throughout the day i continued to text my brother, no answer. he usually takes a while to answer his texts as he works in a basement most days with little service. but going from 8AM to 5PM without one answer was unusual, especially when my texts were clearly concerned and getting more desperate. finally, i called his roommate (who works 10 hour days in the financial sector, so he is very busy during the week) if he knew anything. because of his schedule, he didn't have a super clear idea, but said that my brother was not doing well and had been high a lot this week. he said he was in bad shape the night before and that he was on his way home from work and would call me to tell me how my brother was doing when he got there. 

for 20 minutes, i thought my brother might be dead. i was a total wreck. 

the roommate called me back, said brother was alive, but that he and annoying friend and ex-girlfriend/good friend were going to meet up and have an ""intervention"" of sorts that night. boyfriend (who i work with) had us drop everything and get in a cab. 

it turned out, brother had gotten heroin from a new source since he didn't have his old ones. he tested it and it felt wrong and weird. like 99.999% sure it had fent, with this epidemic going around. he has done fent recreationally in the past, but not for years and years and this could have had some other shit in it, too. basically, he hated it. so he took a bunch of xanax for the next couple days to try and get rid of the feeling. didn't go to work, didn't often leave his bed, fell asleep with a mouth full of goldfish and could have choked, etc. not good. scared the shit out of everyone. today is the first day he's not been totally lethargic and in a xanny-haze. 

talked with him for a long time, want to do it again now that he's more lucid. he had some weird things to say - his relationship with heroin has changed, he hasn't been treating it as a drug anymore, but instead as a way to access his creativity. but then he turned around and said he also uses it to escape things that bother him in his life. so ... yeah he does use it as a drug. also it IS a fucking drug. so he's been lying to himself about it, using it more frequently, letting it interfere with his work, health, and relationships more. we were stern with him and he said he's wanted to stop for years, but still enjoys it and had it under control. he admitted that he is losing control, but was reluctant to agree in so many words that he is ready to stop. he finally did say he was done forever, doesn't want to let us down, and that he would tell me the next time he wants to do it and we'll go do something else. but that feels like such wishful thinking. how many times can you be done with something before you die? 

basically, i just would like some insight and advice. can't 5150 someone unless they admit to being suicidal. also, he is a very private and independent person. he pulls away very quickly if you betray his trust or try and tell him what to do. strongarming him into some kind of structured rehab, i feel would do more harm than good. i want to find something that fits him.. i want him to see a therapist. i want him to remember other things in life that make him feel good. i want him to realize that he is incredibly creative without heroin. i don't want to lose him. if he ever zonks out again, i'm taking him to the hospital, even if they'll only keep him till he wakes up. i want him to know how serious i am, because i don't know if he gets it just by seeing my tears. 

what should i do?

and on top of all this, my boyfriend doesn't think he can ever trust me again because i lied to him and ""gaslit"" him about my brother's drug use. back when i was still drinking, i lied a lot and it's taken him a lot of time and loving to be able to trust me again. now that's shattered and i might be losing the two most important people in my life. i'm so scattered and numb, i'm at a loss of how to deal with either problem, but i want to make sure my brother can be healthy before all else. 



EDIT: TL;DR: my brother is a long time ""lite"" heroin user, lately it's been getting much worse and he gave me a death scare. it wasn't an OD, but it was stupid. he wants to stop and i need advice on how to help. 


EDIT 2: thanks so much for all your replies. this is one of my favorite communities on reddit because of things like this. i will definitely be taking much of yalls advice, insights, lessons learned, hope, reality, and tough love to heart as i go forward with this process. i'll never give up on my brother, but i can see now that he has probably been far more dishonest with me than i previously thought. i wish you all the best, if i have more questions or news i'll be back.

I felt great. i still had some dope in my pocket for later. I bought cigarettes. I got my morning coffee. traffic wasn't all too bad because i got up early enough. everything felt like it was pulling in my favor. Until half way through probably my 4th cigarette in a 30min span i got super nauseous. there i was driving 60 mph without a shoulder to pull over on and looking for something to puke in and it happened. puked all over my clothes, seat and steering wheel. i had tried to catch it all in my sweater but being as how i was driving it was pretty difficult to keep my head down. it was a disaster and i had already payed the bridge to get into NY so there was no turning back.

572vg8,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/572vg8/to_my_brother/,18,https://redd.it/572vg8,panda_trainer,To my brother....,"K so my brother is a little over a year older than me. July '87 here and Oct. '85 for him. Which made him only one year ahead of me in school. Growing up we always were doing something because we had one older sister and another set of two girl sisters that my parents were best friends with that we all came up together. So we were always playing sports, riding bikes, listening to music, video games whatever it was the boys vs the girls gay ass shit. At least that was my mentality when we were that age. 

I always was thrown an age group ahead in little league since our dad coached and honestly I kept up better than being put on a team in my age bracket. Now of course with us spending so much time and doing those activities we would fight constantly even had one of the other sisters become our referee it was such a common occurrence. Played on the basketball and track teams when we were in middle school, even both played the trumpet. 

But eventually we got to where it was more of a competition and we were fighting each other and had totally different sets of friends. He was extremely gifted when it came to athletics. The kid ran a 10.9 100 meter dash.... IN THE 8TH GRADE!!! that summer University of Tennessee track team of invited him to train with them over the summer which he did. Literally picked up a javelin that summer for the first time and wound up going to the junior Olympics at Disney world and won a medal. 

However later through school he started hanging around the druggies of his crowd which I had no idea at the time until one day I had already started selling weed and pulled out a bong in front of him and started smoking. He asked what I was doing and I said getting high now get over here and hit this. 

Our relationship changed from there on. Instead of being at odds and fighting. We formed a bond over getting high and having to work as a team to hide it and do it. These are some great memories for me here. He had a job at krystals after school while I was at home smoking. So I told him as long as you bring us sackfulls home well be getting high every night. And that's just what we did. 

His senior year turning 18 he had wound up getting a 15 year old pregnant (non-stat thank god) which wound up setting my parents off. 

Quick little bit about my parents. I live in the south through the bible belt and have a set of old school no nonsense parents. We were always in trouble and constantly not giving a fuck.

Well once that happened him and my father got into a physical altercation and it was the first (and last) time that had ever happened. Things just went to far. He graduated from high school early that fall and moved out to his friends right at turning 18 and we no longer saw each other so much because he wasn't allowed around our house andy mother was stuck at our house after surgery. Then he got with a different girl and was pregnant agai. They got a house together and he moved about 45 mins away. 

Well we would see each other here and there but he had no idea I was one of if not the biggest drug dealer in our home county and I had no idea he was doing blow and other shit. Until I got with my current girlfriend of the past 4 years and it came up after me getting arrested and I started serving him roxis, opanas, or whatever he wanted. The thing was he had no connects beside one guy who screwed him because he knew the fact also. 

So when he first started he could do half a Roxi 15 and get high. Meanwhile I'm in the other seat railing 3 30s and would have to again in a few hours to maintain. Well as his habit grew I introduce him to opanas to save money and do less product. (Its killing me thinking about this now). I even got him started on the h once those were a little hard to come by. 

Well he had lost his job and was having a hard time hiding all this money missing and habit from his wife who knows the game herself but after their three daughters didn't partake like that anymore. And she eventually wound up filing foe divorce and was trying to get custody of their kids (which were his world he did anything for those girls). Well one night he took it to far and the cops were called and he was chargdd who domestic and I had to bail him out with a new restraining order in place. 

So just like that after living there with her for 10 years nearly he was homeless and had to move in with my parents where I was living also for the moment after being arrested. Well he felt useless and worthless with all of this going on feeling like she had and iron clad case now with the domestic and he was losing his wife and girls. He began using harder and harder. He finally wound up taking one of my dads checks and writing a check to himself for $1000 which worked because they have the same first and last name. And it wound up almost causing my parents to lose their house when the house payments bounced and they had to try and play catch up losing that grand. 

My dad decided he couldn't trust him and told him he couldn't stay there anymore and he started just staying outside the house cuz he had nowhere to go and I would give him food and let him ride to work with me and sleep in my car. Well finally me and my girl got an apartment and he was able to sleep on our couch and I didn't have to worry about him being out in the cold anymore. He also got another drive driving fuel tankers (had his cdl) and made pretty good money. The only problem is you can guess where it all went and who he had to go through. Because every time he went through someone else they would either rob him or screw him. 

Well he wound up losing that job after losing his cdl for an incident I can't think of right now for some reason and he even hid this fact from me he was so embarrassed and afraid my girl would kick him out. Now the only reason we were able to get our apartment was because my girls well off grandparents signed for it and were making the payments. Well they showed up one morning and noticed he was staying with us and told him he had to leave or w all had to go. 

So I told him just to get his stuff out and stay in his car for a little bit till this can blow over and he could come back. Well that's the same time he lost his job, was going to court and being prosecuted by my father for identify theft, court for divorcé and the domestic, and he had to go to jail. 

                  THE DAY OF 

So he wound IP getting out this day and had my papaw take Jim to the impound where his car was and got what he needed out of his car and then he was dropped off with his soon to be ex wife at a car lot. Now I know he got money from her because they had just got their tax returns and they had 3 girls to claim. From their he tried to call me to get him but I had to go to work and couldn't get him. He tried to call my girl but she was pissed he wasn't sharing his tax returns with us and she hung up on him. My dad was at work and couldn't get him. My sister wouldn't go and pick him up (yay tuff love running in the family) and my mom didn't have a car. Well he had been picked up and drove UP to the hood to get some h and was robbed and left up there without a cell phone even. 

My dad tried to go to the last gas station he called from when he got off but he didn't find him there and had n way to call him. I worked 3rd shift and wouldn't be off till 6 a.m. He also had gone to my grandparents through the night and knocked on their door only to be ignored and not even open the door for him. He called a friend and his wife wouldn't let him in the house either and he wound up sleeping under their fucking staircase which was only 5 steps. 

My mom called me the next day and told me not to go to work and come down to the house but wouldn't say why which had me thinking it was one of our grandparents esps. Moms dad who has Alzheimer's. Well my mom who watches my sisters daughter for her was going to take her outside to play and wound up finding him hanging in a tree right outside in the woods and had to keep it together trying not to let on my 3 year old niece till help arrived. He didn't leave a note or any explanation what so ever.

To this day my dad thinks someone else was involved BC he doesn't understand depression. But I know that it was just the perfect shitstorm and legal situations he was facing that did it. I mean literally every single person had shit on him and the only one that was willing I didn't think loson my job was worth it but I had no clue what was in store or I would have been there instantly. Days later at work where I drove a forklift backing out of a trailer slowly I soft long squeak from shrink wrap put an image of him struggling and regretting what he did and reaching out for me screaming out as much as he could with that rope around his neck. 

Since then I've wanted to go fins him myself or when my depression is killing me like losing my job being dope sick lonely with girl gone etc. Then I feel like I'm even more stuck because I could never put my family or girl through that again. It was even worse than planning a suicide BC it's like I had no way out. That's another reason I'm taking this step here of rehab.

572f7x,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/572f7x/goodbye/,19,https://redd.it/572f7x,panda_trainer,Goodbye,"Hey guys I've been apart of our sub here going on a little over 3 years. I use to post a lot more but lately I've just been creeping more the past year or two. Mainly it has to do with getting to know people and then hearing over and over again that they had past and I had heard it so much on here as well as real life it made me kinda standoffish to posting just to have it continue happening. 

     If you want to scroll through my post history you can find the first time I was caught with drugs and a little about my past. That was at 16 years old and I'll be turning 30, in 2017. I feel it literally ingrained into me as a person to use dope. Its all i know. I mean think of how many memories and current day behaviors you still use that you learned before you were 15-16. Then think about the same thing after those ages. 

     From those ages until present day the most clean time I've been able to string together is 30 days. That's it. 30 days. Its taken so much away from me including, kicked out of school, going to jail, shot at, shooting at, robbed with children right next to, multiple best friends tossing our friendship aside for a quick buck, losing trust and respect from all family, I mean I could go on and on.

     And sadly I still don't hate the drugs. I like getting high. Let me fix that I LOVE GETTING HIGH. I don't do it to escape or mask some other emotions I can't deal with. I had a good childhood growing up. Parents were together, let me play any sport or go on any field trip that came up. The truth of it is I just love the feeling of being high and its hard for me to get people to believe and/or understand that. Mainly because my brother committed suicide in April of 2015 by hanging himself in my parents woods beside their house. Him and I were pretty damn close and was even living with me and my girlfriend for months literally the week before it happened. If you want that whole story I'll be glad to share but I don't want to make this post infinitly long by adding it in.

     However I can't continue to live like this. Its only a matter of time before I'm either dead or thrown in the pen instead of county.  So I've finally realized. Can't do this on my own like I'm use to handling problems. On very strong willed and take pride in it. However it's not working and I need the help and guidance. 

     So, tom morning I will be leaving and heading 4 hours away (same state) to a rehab program and also was able to go for free due to an ex addict that saw himself inside me and went above and beyond to get me help. He literally got me set up with all of this in less than a week. Which is good because any longer and I may have backed out. 

     So anyway I just wanted to say I love this sub and its crazy ass people. I've met some in real life , talked to some whether over text/phone call/ or emails and (knock on wood) I've always found the coolest people that share my dope habit and also sadly seen them pass. I don't want that for my family a second time or for you guys to lose another member its been far to many. And would be even more if it weren't for the most wonderful poster on here TRACY! I can't thank you enough for all that you do hear Tracy. From sharing your wisdom to literally saving lives with sending put narcan and clean and fresh supplies, while never asking for recognition or praise. From the bottom of my heart Tracy you saved my girlfriend one night and I wouldn't have her if it werent for your narcan.

     I'll be gone for 90 days and not sure if I'll be able to use the internet until I move to the halfway house or if I can use it in inpatient. But I'll continue to check in on you guys whenever I get the chance and some free time. Wish me the best of luck and ill keep you guys in mind hopefully the positive energy can help keep y'all safe. Be safe/watch cops/ and always take calculated risk. I'm not dumb enough to say dont.. I know the game to well, simply calculate the risk/reward of the situation it has saved my ass more than once.

I'm gonna keep it somewhat short and see if anyone else has some good banter on this topic. After a few months clean twice this year I am using again. After starting back up using two bundles twice a week (high most days) I recently lowered my use to two bundles only once a week (high 2 or 3 days). I am bouncing back to feeling good after using pretty fast, only feeling sick/minor WD for about a day after using. 

Now that you know my habit I'll make my point. When I'm actually high I am so close to appearing 'normal' to others, saving my nods for in private, usually late at night. For the day or two after getting lit for a few days I realize people are noticing I don't seem like myself, possibly sick, possibly tired, possibly *high*?

My point on this topic is simple. most people who don't use opiates associate the symptoms of WD (tired, no energy, no appetite, flu symptoms, etc.) with what someone on heroin would be like. Little do they know heroin makes me ALIVE and the sickness is what makes me appear as what society perceives as a junkie. 

If someone goes as far as to accuse you of using when you are sick because they think you are high they aren't wrong about calling you out.... the sickness is all to familiar as part of the lifestyle for anyone with a habit, it's a huge sign of addiction. I'm starting to realize how obvious it is that I'm using purely based on 'not feeling well' once a week.",1476234579.0

I've enjoyed reading whatever stories people have been telling, and I've liked knowing that I'm not the only person with an addiction and an internet connection.

I've been sober for maybe a week total now, like I've not used dope for that long. It's the longest I've been sober since I started. I've been going to methadone for about 7 weeks, honestly I feel lucky that they believed that I want to get better, that I was trying. I feel like this is the first place I've gone that didn't expect instant results. I tried Detox, and AA, and getting sick on my own. But the second I'd be sober there was always so much pressure on me to get my shit together. I wish that every methadone clinic could operate the way mine does. I've met a lot of the people that work there, and they all give a shit, and they all know that junkies don't get better right away. 

Anyway, I just wanted to post here, for the people still rocking the needle with no plans of stopping, for the people that have lost too much already and just need it to be over, and for everyone else that doesn't really know why they do dope or if they want to stop. 

I was up to needing 35 bags a day (NJ dope, usually .02g a bag, usually cut with fent) to not feel sick. I had to shoot 25 bags to feel a slight high, and 40 to nod (Now I understand those lunatics that use steroid syringes). I was beat, I'd wanted to stop for a long time, but just couldn't stop myself from buggin when I'd start to get sick. Doing something I'd hate myself for, and driving down to the hood.

It took three days for them to get me on a dose of methadone where I wasn't feeling totally shitty all day. I kept using for a while, cos I didn't really know what else to do. But I'm sober now.

I'm slowly pulling my life back together, and I realized that yesterday was the first time that I went all day without thinking about dope. (Was distracted by my need for cig money is prolly why). I really had given up, I didn't think I'd go on living a whole lot longer especially not without dope. Things are looking better for the first time in a while.

Background: I'm a big fan of psychs, and I also just recently stocked up on U-47700 before the ban even though I've never been a huge user. 

Anyways, storytime. Yesterday I had my first real day off in weeks, so obviously I decided to trip. Had 125ug of ALD-52 and had a great time. Coming down I basically chain smoked bud until I was stoned out of my mind. I decided I wanted to relax a bit more, and when I realized I was out of alcohol I decided to grab my U-4 nasal spray. 

Now normally I'm obsessed with harm reduction. Obsessively paying attention to dosages, no dangerous combinations, etc. But something about my stoned/tripped out mindset made me too stupid to pay attention to how much u-4 I was using. 

A few minutes after my last stiff, something hit me like a brick and I could feel my body struggling with something. I got lightheaded, my fingers started to get numb, my heart was racing and my chest was super tight. Took me more than a second to realize I stopped breathing. 

After that it was a rough night. Every few minutes I would lose my complete focus on breathing and forget for a second. My heart was pounding forever. I had to stand up and walk around so I didn't nod out, but I still came pretty close to just passing out while I was moving. My circulation was awful; my hands and feet were numb for a few hours, my face was pale and clammy, and it was super hard to feel my pulse (even though my BP was around 150/115 for most of the night). I had a super irregular heartbeat and was convinced I was going to have a heart attack or stroke or something. 

The tripsit chat was pretty helpful, but they could only do so much. I fought the nod for hours but kept finding reasons to panic harder. I'm not sure what was worse, the inability to breath or the 7 hour long panic attack because of it. Any helpful anxiolytic technique I tried made me suffocate or almost nod out, and obviously I couldn't dose a benzo to calm myself down, so all I could do was ride it out. Since I was also coming down from my trip, I also had relatively intense sensory disturbances for most of the night, fueled by the panic. Moving shadows, hearing whispers, inability to really identify temperature well and inability to gauge my heartbeat accuratly. These hallucinations seemed more real than acid-like perception; a couple times I forgot I tripped earlier and panicked even further.

~6 hours after my last U-4 dose I slowly started to breath a little better and could feel my circulation improving. This was around 7am. I was getting more and more tired, so I tried to lay down for a second, but I stopped breathing as soon as I closed my eyes. I decided I couldn't really make my situation worked, but maybe a stimulant could help the OD symptoms?

Over the next half hour I ate ~100mg of meth (note that I do have a pretty high stim tolerance). I also dosed a bit of ibuprofen and a beta blocker (which I had been using occasionally throughout the night, without much effect). 

The biggest relief of my life so far is when the stims hit me; finally I could breath again, my chest wasn't throbbing, and my extremities started to feel more normal by the second. 

I only stayed awake for a few more minutes after the worst was over. My heart was still racing, so I dosed 1mg etizolam since I knew I was safe to do so. Before the effects of the etiz even hit me I was out. I've never been so happy to wake up alive. 

Epilogue: I decided to take a little time off from intoxication. A friend is going to be holding onto my stash for a few weeks. I know I'm not an addict or anything but I definitely need a break. I also don't think I'll ever use opioids recreationally again. After this it just isn't worth the plethora of risks. 

**TL;DR**: I think I OD'd on U-47700 coming down from a trip. Symptoms induced a panic attack, which both lasted for around 6 hours. Couldn't breath, difficult to not nod off, vivid dark acid hallucinations, and my heart beated out of my chest. Eventually improved slightly, then ate some meth and fell asleep the moment I could breath again",1476213100.0

He hasn't used in the past 3 years (supposedly) but has been on methadone. Incidentally, I am often wondering if he is still using. Here are the sources of my suspicion:
• He takes benzos often, but will lie to me about how often he uses them. He recently gave me 10 to hold on to, that way he would have to ask for them. When it got down to the last one, he said they were for his friend who was coming over after work. I was up until 3 AM that night, and I never heard a car pull up.
• He sleeps all day long.
• Will stay in his room all day and never come out.
• He lies about what he is doing. He says: ""I am working all next week."" yet his car doesn't leave the house for days...then comes out of his room wearing his work uniform.
• Acts like he is making a lot of money at his job, but our light bill did not get paid this past month.

I have never really used opiates beside the occasional pain killer, so I guess I am looking for input. He lies so much.",1476209580.0

Being the dumbass I am, I don't know how to judge if it's authentic until it's in my bloodstrean. So I paid for what looked like I thought it was supposed to, real dark tar like but was hard chunk to begin with that broke up first like what in used to, then after first split, the smaller pieces were stickier and little harder to separate without sticking to everything. It broke down I water with heat and stirring to a consistent dark liquid and drew up without other trash leftover, but didn't do anything from my tester. I tasted a little piece and didn't taste anything like what I thought should but couldn't tel what it did. At this point I just thought I must've just gotten some really weak stuff so I fixed up the rest, 4x the first one. Same thing, nothing except what I couldn't tell if was placebo or some actual subtle strange feeling , bit nothing like the rush it should be. Later as driving 2 hours back home I got a bit of weird feeling, but couldve been placebo from being afraid it was something dangerous to be concerned about. Next day I had a piece that must've flown from the first attempt at breaking the rock. Now knowing for sure it was bs i went ahead and out in mouth to taste and with more to go off it definitely had a burnt taste, but not sure what it was still.

I'm just curious as I know nothing about it, what this dude actually gave me. Obviously there are all kinds of things shit is cut with but I just wonder if there's some specific thing people do to make fake, and if it is more dangerous or anything to worry about.

I did well for the first three years, I didn't use anything and was productive with school and work. Well I got bored started drinking and ended up having a daily drinking habit that only stopped when I ended up so sick from a stomach ulcer that I could no longer drink. In fact I was so sick at this pint I had to quite my job and started to just lounge around while I felt ill all day. I used cannabis to help myself eat, sleep and take care of lots of the symptoms of my illness but I've been sick everyday since then. I did that for three more years until a week ago when I decided I wanted to try a week without subs. I was convinced that Subs were causing my health issues and only switching to dope or pst for a week would let me know for sure what was going on. So after waiting 24 hours from my last sub dose I took Some pst and waited a hour. It didn't do much as 3mg subs is a powerful dose and takes a large amount of anything to mask it's withdrawals. So being a fool I cold copped in a new city, scored what I wanted and headed home feeling quite sick and ready to take care of it. So I started smoking the g of bth and get better but not anywhere near what I was expecting it was a whisper of a feeling.  The next day I still didn't take any subs and continued to use, it started wearing hard on my mind that I was rest screwing up, like all this time I was sober and staying consistent was for nothing and now I'm left won't tons of depression and guilt. Also I'm terrified to go back on the subs and have withdrawal from not waiting long enough, in the past I never went past three days of no subs when I used so it always was in my system but this time I'm pushing past that three day mark and I'm supposed to wait 24 hours before dosing the subs.  Has anyone done this and been fine? I know that I will feel a bit off the first few days back on subs but should I be alright to take them once I'm feeling withdrawal around the 24hr mark?  

Also I want off subs all together but every time I withdraw all my sickness symptoms get 10x worse. Swollen glands all over my body, fever, night sweats, things I never experienced before I got sick and Tried to detox. So can anyone with long term sub experience help me out understanding what I should expect with detox and also a safe plan for getting back on subs once I'm done with my bth vacation I would be very grateful.

I will update this post as more rumors get posted and give credit to the people who posted them.

I will go first.

1.  Alprazolam (Xanax) is NOT water soluble.  Snorting Xanax does NOTHING different than taking them orally, as a drug needs to be water soluble to absorb into your mucus membranes.  Since Xanax is not, it simply bypasses them, and drops down your throat, giving you the high/effect.  It will not get you higher, and if it does hit you faster, its because the pill is crushed when you ingest it...if you crush the pill before you take it orally, it will come on just as fast.

2.  There ia no such thing as a Percocet 30.  Percocet is a formulation of Oxycodone that includes Acetaminophen.  The dose of Percocet only goes up to 10mg.  The 5, 7.5, and 10mg number is the amount of Oxycodone...the 325, 500 number is the amount of Acetaminophen.  Please do not snort Percocet, as it is horrible for your nasal passages to snort that much Acetaminophen for a small amount of Oxycodone.

3.  Oxycodone has the highest bioavailability when taken orally, other than IV (which is 100%).  Snorting and smoking Oxycodone may produce a slight rush, but you are wasting a bit of Oxycodone that way.  You are certainly free to ingest your drugs the way you want, but it seems to be a common misconception that snorting/smoking is a better ROA, but people fail to realize they are wasting a percentage of Oxycodone.

So I roll to hit the floor  
Been thinking like one dead  
Maybe it’s time for just one more?

This time away’s been gray  
Just looking for a distraction  
But now I want to play  
My disease is my contraction  

Please file me away under L for fucking lost  
Cause I’m thinking of really doing it  
And I don’t care about the cost  
The doctors they been saying  
That my humanity’s been slippin, fading  
That I’m just always playing  
That I don’t feel nothing real  
In the words that I’m praying  
But my face isn’t even funny, I shoot to kill this time  
Odd how just last month I felt just right and fine  

So baby take one more look at my sorry fucking face  
I got a loaded up syringe and I’m fixing to leave this place  
I’ve been writing and writing my fears my lusts my lows  
And you thought you’re the only one my suffering truly knows  

And oh I’ve been such a good little boy, been working the nine to five  
I’ve told you the right things   
I can even say I’ve tired  
But tonight it’s been a raining  
And raining in my bed  
So ima take this syringe  
And point it at my head  

Finally the rush is there  
Overwhelming gushing everywhere  
I’m a trippy dippy hippy  
It’s my first time at the fair  

Feeling nothing is respite  
That I eat like a BreathRite  
The kinda nothing that I love  
Like risky sex with no glove  

This syringe aint big enough   
Did someone shrink it maybe?  
And what’s wrong with my veins?  
Has my body be-fuckin-trayed me?  

I need to feel my score  
I need to boot up, bottom out  
I guess I’m looking for some more  
This is all I really believe in  
My life’s fine pointed goal  
And if I die tomorrow  
My guilt won’t press me into coal  

Cause I know how you see me  
I know I’m a dirty creep  
But how about you have to pay a hundred bucks  
Just to get some shitty sleep  

So file me away as don’t even fucking care  
I play with life and death   
Like you play at truth or dare

Will keep it short and simple. 

Dad, 52yrs old, was a meth user more than a decade ago. I noticed increased anger, speediness, less patience, etc back then which is out of character; usually happy, laid back etc. 

He has always been a very heavy pot smoker which has typical effects. 
Lately he has been hanging around an old friend who was also big on crystal, and just checked out of rehab (gonna call him ""R"")

Another friend just passed of H overdose, ""R"" lived with him. 

Today when visiting, he was especially speedy (he usually is hyper unless completely stoned) but his pupils seemed to be quite pinned in comparison to mine. Also euphoric, happy, not any increased anger/decreased patience. Said he went on a midnight ""bike ride"" w ""R."" Talked about how ""R"" was all over the place, typical speediness, but claimed R was taking ""medication"" from the rehab and that was why. Hmmm. 

Could he be mixing meth/opiates? Would opiates really keep him up all night and still speedy throughout the day if he used to prefer amphetamines? Just curious. His health doesn't seem to be in immediate danger, I trust his choices but would like to get feedback.

Filtering then boiling water to get it sterile, uncapping a new needle, getting the cotton, weighing and mixing the shot, dropping the cotton in, drawing up, disinfecting my arm, finding a vein and registering. All of that was so satisfying, especially that little explosion of red in the syringe. It's so pretty in a way, and I know others like at least that image. I got nearly the same satisfaction from preparing lines, though it did take less time and therefore was slightly less good.

Experienced adventurers wanted, I'm going in!","I found the right road, pulled in, slowed down and out of nowhere a guy hopped into the passenger side of the car.  (That would be the left hand side in the UK). He fished around in his bag of whites and dark wraps and passed me a tiny plastic knotted bag - which promptly fell between his fingers and between the seat and center console. FUCK.. He made a groaning noise, fumbled around for a good 15 minutes (all the while, I prayed he wouldn't find it - and praise the lord, Junkie Jesus half granted my wish of a free bag). Eventually, he just gave up, handed me (carefully) another little knotted bag from his larger, very full bag of them - I paid and he jumped out the car and vanished. As soon as I got home, I found a flashlight and got on my hands and knees to set about searching for myself... aaaannnd, nothing! This little thing has vanished. This is not anywhere near the first time I've lost bags in cars, but I've always found them again. The worst car incident was in my peak days of using, the quality I was getting was so strong I only ever smoked a single line before nodding in and out of reality and being to wrecked to move until I could pick up the foil again and repeat. I had savings, so I never stopped.. it had got to the point where serious sickness would ensue within 5 hours if I didn't keep it up! Anyway, I picked up one time - not thinking I simply put them on the dashboard - after going round a corner at some speed, they all rolled across the dash into an air-vent (luckily I didn't have a window open or with my luck, they would have bounced right across the dashboard and out of an open window!) Took me 4 hours with a screwdriver and a saw to cut a hole in the ventilation system in the dash to get them out again - FUCK my car, I was SO desperate - and knowing that there is a bag of your drug of choice within 1ft that you can't get to is enough to make you go insane.
  

Anyway. This lost bag is somewhere under or between the rail that the seat slides back and forth upon. That's it.. I've looked under it, next to it.. there's not really any other place it could have fallen. The car is a Mini Cooper S if it makes any difference... but from stories I've heard of bags lost in cars, I'm now convinced there is a breakdown of the time/space continuum that folds into a pocket universe via a small hidden dimension in most cars - it's just large enough to lose a small wrap or bag of H inside. Driving around and knowing there is a bag of gear under me at all times is going to make me take a crowbar to this thing..
_________________________________
Edit : Update for interested peeps!  
I spent a long time running my fingers along under the seat rail as tightly as I could. There were various indentations and imperfections, but there was something there that moved ever-so-slightly. I felt like a safe-cracker. You need incredibly sensitive touch perception to determine what the very ends of your (admittedly scared, burnt and calloused) fingers have come into contact with. Using a combination of rolling-cigarette filters that come in tubes (nice a long and soft, but flexible) to determine there was something there - I could have easily pushed into a worse position as it was under the seat rail quite far back. I had to and slowly edge it out from under there, forwards quite a long way and into the foot-well. There are a LOT of traps... carpet holes, bolts and various dope-bag hazards that could have split the bag on its journey. But yay... free bag! Thanks slippery handed dealer!",1476455572.0

I have been lurking for a while.  First off, I'd like to say this is a very tight community.  A beacon of warmth in the cold shit internet.

Anyhow, here's my situation: I'm a single dad.  About 2 years ago my kids mom starts a pretty quick transition from decent enough mom to kind of erratic and irresponsible (couldnt hold a schedule and showed up hours lates, wasnt getting my boy to school, claimed both she and he had illnesses, etc).  Turns out she has scripts for:
Oxy
Morphine
Vicodin
Opana
Xanax
Addies
Tramidol
and a few other things

Shes a former nurse on disability for a rare disease that causes pain (which ive never seen symptoms of)

Anyway, is that a fuckton of meds?

Also she lost custody of our son (there was a court case that her currwnt SOs family filed) and now he's with me full time.  Her and I didn't get along very well, but it sucks for my boy that his mom has changed a ton and that she can't see him right now.  But with her behavior i think its better for him to be with me (clean and sober and getting him to school on time and shit)

So she has some court ordered hoops to jump through now to get some timesharing with my boy back and she's not jumping through them.

She hasnt shown any desire to change her behavior and right now she is of the mindset that she has this disease and therefore she needs these meds.

I don't know enough about opiates to know for sure, but it feels like she's doctor shopping?

If she's not ready to change is there anything I can do?

Any general thoughts/ideas?

No judgment or anything just thought it might be cool for me to ask here.

Cheers,

Moose",1476422735.0

I was very drawn towards the blatant display of community and support, especially here in r/opiates.
        I'm a poly drug user and have been for about 16 years. Done my fair share of stims,Psychedelics/empathogens, and pharms. Opiates and benzos are my go-to for the most part. I was fortunate enough to have a close childhood friend who was willing to share and introduce me to some of my favorite DOC's. I was getting 100mg morphine (kadian) capsules, and oxycodone 30's for free or dirt cheap. We would snort and eat countless pills while playing video games until we'd nod and lose to the NPC's in FPS's.
       It wasn't until after high school that I really started to purchase them to do by myself. I was purchasing 100mg MS Contin and the occasional Xanax from my buddy who I worked with and whom id purchase weed from. 
      Flash forward to my early 20's. 100mg Morphine would last me about 4-5 days, usually snorting about 25mg's before work, at a nightclub. Shortly after I met ""the love of my life."" I was very open about my opiate use, she wasn't judge mental about it at first, and we would occasionally do Coke or mdma together. 
    A few years down the road, we're living together, and my same childhood buddy introduces me to fentanyl patches. I'm instantly hooked to smoking those patches. Fucking instantaneously. Lots of people say it's a ""soulless"" or ""empty"" opiate but I fell in love. The drug-use affected my relationship, needless to say. I could tell I was really hurting this women I loved, and after finally realizing I was being a heartless drug addict, I broke things off with her after 5 years. By far my biggest regret but I'm glad I put a stop to the damage I was inflicting on this women who cared so much for me. She was the best thing that ever happened to me and I effortlessly fucked it all up, despite being given multiple chances.
    2 years later I'm dating a new girl I met online, who turns out to be an ex-heroin addict. It only takes a few months for me to find us opiates, then shortly she introduces me to the needle. We get an apartment together and it only takes a few months for us to start shooting dilaudid.  Daily. I get super depressed and feel resentful towards her for introducing me to needles, even though I'm an adult and fully accountable for my actions. 
        Few months forward: I start buying crack every time I cop us dilaudid. Her father was a crack addict which makes shit even more difficult. We get evicted from our apartment and she moves back with her family. I quit crack and needles cold turkey Christmas morning after a long binge. 
      I've been clean from crack and needles for over a year but I still use opiates about 5-10 times a month. I have no disillusions about being an addict but I'm glad the needle and pipe are behind me.
   Not really sure why I felt the need to share this but I've only really shared my needle story with 2 of my closest friends. Sorry for the poorly written sob-story.

If it's what I need to stay alive and clean from heroin/""real"" opioids, especially from shooting up again, then I think it's a very good thing. Subs make me motivated, energetic, happy, not nearly as shy as usual, and generally just help me go about my day. Just like hard opiates did, but not quite to that strong extent.

That said, there are a few downsides. Obviously there's the constipation. This has gotten better in the past year or so but it's still a problem at least once a week or so, there'll be a day when I just can't shit and I know I have to. I know how long I can go without shitting before I'm going to be in trouble (i.e. going to be on the toilet in terrible pain for 3 hours) unless I can go soon. So I just make sure that doesn't happen, but every few months I can't and it sucks and I sit there for an hour or more in pain. Still, it's not nearly as bad as it used to be (I've long had stomach upset/pain which is part of why I love opiates).

ANYWAY, actually just as annoying as constipation is the urinary retention or whatever. It makes it so I have to piss constantly, like I don't even know how many times a day... but each time it's usually not that much. Then I'll have to piss again 20-30 min later (or less even!) Sometimes it's worse than others, and it's not so bad that I despair over it every night, but it's just a very annoying side effect to deal with sometimes, especially when in public or with friends.

Now, the other downside is more complex. Of course I have cravings, like we all do from time to time, but this isn't just that. It's more that being on the subs all the time makes everything levelled out. Everything is pretty good, I don't get the highs of IV Heroin nor many of the lows of sober depression. And so what I end up missing, at least sometimes, is precisely the withdrawals I'd get when using -- followed by the warm relief of a nice shot or a handful of pills, etc. I find myself wanting to skip days of subs in order to feel that beautiful relief and have it hit harder and give me a nice buzz. Thing is, I'm so sensitive to w/d's that I can't do that. So it's just something in the back of my mind... it's not that subs turned me into a ""zombie"" or whatever as some claim, all flattened out and emotionless, it's just that I don't get the same highs and lows, naturally, as when using. And I kinda miss that. You know what I mean?",1476401084.0

-

I woke up to my girlfriend screaming at me after just hitting me with narcan (my lips were blue, snore/gurgling etc). definitely the whole 'holy fuck, really? how long was I out for??' thing that everyone always does after an OD. 

-

anyways, while I fully understand the brevity of ODing in front of family and partners and what damage it does to them, I can't shake this weird feeling from my head after seeing the 'void'. it's not suicidal ideation or anything like that, it's more like the void of death that feels like it is tugging me in a very curious way. I'm not depressed or anything or had any feelings of self harm prior to this OD (and still don't). BUT, it did create an insane level of curiosity within me. it sparked this existential crisis/analysis that I've never had before. it wasn't sad, it wasn't frightening, it isn't depressing - it's more like 'holy fuck. so that is what it is like to die? that's it?? getting crushed by a wave of euphoria? whoa. no fucking way.' 

-

so my question is: anybody else had this overwhelming feeling of morbid fascination with WTF that other side was after an OD? not from a self-harm standpoint, but more of a 'well that wasn't so bad. glad I'm alive, but I've felt way worse while trying to pass an opiate dookie or trying to sit through the presidential debates, yet I literally just died and it didn't 'feel' like I died' kind of stand point? 

I'm all for harm reduction and staying alive. I'm super stoked that my girl was there with the rcan, but fuck if it didn't conjure up some interesting thoughts and perspectives. I view them as healthy, but I was wondering if anyone else has had this head space.",1476399203.0

I've been taking the nucynta as I figured it would be best to eliminate the subutex first then taper down on the nucynta. 


I didn't really taper on the subutex. not sure why. I guess i thought it was blocking the nucynta and I figured i'd get better relief from the nucynta with zero subutex in my system.

optimally, my goal is to have no dependence issues and be able to take nucynta occasionally when i have a back pain flare up and that's it, like maybe 4-5 (75mg) pills a week at the most. 

I am seriously considering taking like a 1mg chunk of subutex to help with my gut and stuff. or should I try tagamet? 

I need advise soon if you can spare it. i'll give you guys an hour before I break down and take some sub. I am starting to wonder if I should have tapered more instead of going cold turkey (albeit from just one medication)

So I banged it, felt great and went about my business for about 30 minutes when I started getting a headache.  My friend offered me an aspirin, and I took it.  Within 5 minutes, I started shivering and I asked her if she felt cold.  She said it was a *little* chilly, but I felt like I was completely naked in the snow.  I started shaking more and more, to the point that she noticed when I broke a cigarette in two between my fingers as I smoked it.  She immediately knew what was up, and by the time I was in the full throes of it, sweating and in pretty horrible pain, she had me bundled up and gave me a muscle relaxer as well as a shot of vodka.  She comforted me as I continued to shake violently and moan in pain for the next four hours.  She never left my side once, and she even let me sleep in her bed as I could barely even lift my head to drink the water she would hold for me (as I could hold a glass without spilling everything).  She checked my temp and it was 103.  I thankfully passed out and slept from 9pm to 3pm the next day.  I feel much better, but I had to vent on here.  Always use a clean spoon, and if there's any hint that there's dirt or something in your mix, don't bang it.  And don't reuse cottons.  That's pretty much begging for it.

He pulled up and said that he didn't have enough at home, so we were going to have to run over to his plugs house and he would run in to get it. We immediately said no, but the truth is, we were both on the verge of a nasty withdraw. So, we agreed as long as he left his wallet...which he agreed with. 

So, pulled up and got his wallet and drivers license, so we were as confident as we could be in this situation.

He got the product, but instead of turning to come back to the truck....he runs the other way to a waiting car....which speeds off with him.

So we take off in the truck and when we turn the corner we see his car broken down in the middle of the road. Once we get to the car we realize that he had jumped out of the car and left his wife all alone to deal with us. Which honestly put us in a awkward situation.

I have been reading this reddit for quite a while now but haven't found an answer to my questions yet; I apologies if it does happen to be a question that has been answered over a zillion times already. 

Does crushing and snorting methadone give it extras, like an intensified or longer high? Or is taking them orally the best way to get most out of them? 
I read here that snorting oxy's doesn't do anything for extra, except loosing an amount of substance, but does that apply for both Oxycontin (extended release) as well as Oxynorm (instant release)?

That's what we told ourselves, but we were past broke. We had a little cash in the bank to pay (the most important) bills and $30k in credit card debt. And, the baby needs milk and diapers. Fuck it. We have to move back home. 

We had moved out of state a few years before, newly married, looking for some distance from everything we knew. It felt like an adventure at first but lately it was a grind. She had a pretty good job and I had two shitty ones. We had a nice car we couldn't afford and an apartment that matched, and we couldn't keep up with the bills. 

Her parents agreed to take the three of us in. She found a job first and moved right away with the baby. She enlisted our friends from back home to make the five hour drive, lug our stuff down three flights of stairs and into a Uhaul to get us back home. I was low. We told everyone we just wanted to be near family for the kids sake. Truth was we had tried and failed and it was our fault, my fault. I was the failure. I had failed to earn. Failed to save. Failed to budget. Failed to see the reality of the situation and do anything about it. 

Now we were living at her parents. Good people. Kind beyond words. She's working, a decent paycheck, but she hates it. I'm working retail. I hate it more. But the creditors aren't calling and we can throw her parents a few bills every month so I don't feel like a complete freeloader. There's even enough money to get some dental work done that I've been putting off. My teeth are shit. Might as well get a physical too. She has insurance so it's free, and my side hurts. I have neglected my health for years now. 

If you've read this far, congratulations. This is the part you've been waiting for. The part where a White Knight in a lab coat has filled my scrip from my dentist. And the scrip from my GP. And the scrip from the surgeon who repaired the hernia in my side. It's early 2000's and no one has heard of pill shopping or pain clinics but there is no need to shop around yet. I just ask, and they deliver. I really don't know any better. I don't either. I don't remember the root canals being painful. I have a huge pain tolerance and hate taking medication for anything really, but that hernia repair, mother fucking christ. It was like being stabbed with every move. Fuck. That. Shit. I. Want. The. Pills. So I took pills. I took lots of pills. 

Some of you know and some of you don't. I'm going to tell it anyway. It wasn't just the physical pain. The shame I felt at 25 living in my inlaw's basement. Working shitty retail. Hating my life. Buried in debt. No plan. Depression. Work, eat, sleep, repeat, repeat, repeat... Repeat. Nothing is good. I'm pushing everyone away. I work a lot. It keeps my mind off my problems and we need the money but money isn't our biggest problem anymore, and because I can't work all the time. I need to relax. I deserve to relax. I shouldn't have to bear the full weight of what I've done to myself. These pills are my right. I deserve this. I work hard. I can't afford a vacation. I can't even afford a good bottle of whiskey with all this debt. But I can afford a $10 copay and that will get me 100 little white vacations in a little amber bottle so that's what I take, and nobody knows. 

Wake up, take pills, just to get me going, I say. Work, take pills, just to get me through it, I say. Home, take pills, because I deserve to relax, I say. 

Repeat, repeat, repeat. 

I am a drug addict. I'm on my last bottle of little white vacations. I've never bought off the street, but the doctors have all made it clear by now that I'm cut off. I have a decision to make. I have to decide what I want and what I'm willing to do to get it. I want pills. Fuck I want pills. But it's still a decision. I do have a choice. I could see the next few years laid out in front of me with two clear paths. I knew the end of one path was me, alone, dead or in jail if I didn't kick. I had already hurt my family by not dealing with the reality of my situation once. I couldn't fail them like that again. I understood how it works now. I understood that it was only going to get harder from here on out. I rationed out the last of my hydros and did my best to wean myself down. I was a miserable fuck for the next few months but I did it. I did it.

Nobody knew. My doctors, maybe knew. OK, sure, they probably knew. But my wife, her family, my family, all our friends never had a clue. Any satisfaction I got from beating my addiction was canceled out ten times over by the shame of going down that path in the first place. So I kept it a secret until last year. 

I needed surgery for a torn ligament in my shoulder and everyone told me it's going to be a painful recovery with lots of therapy ""but don't worry, they'll give you plenty of good meds, ha ha ha, wink nudge"". Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. A million times FUCK. I was scared. Real actual terrible fear. I had to come clean to stay clean so I told my wife about everything. She was shocked, very shocked, but also very supportive. The surgery went fine, and they were right about the pain. As much as I didn't want to I took the pills, but only for 2 days. (They gave me 100 of those fuckers and FWIW I don't count that use against my recovery.) That was a year ago. My life is better now. Not perfect by any means, but we both have jobs we like and two great kids, and as far as people know I'm just another middle aged white guy in the burbs living the dream behind the white picket fence, but my name is Andrew and I am an addict. I have been in recovery for 13 years and 2 months. Thank you for reading my story.",1476544446.0
57mg46,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/57mg46/the_mountain_and_the_mouse/,5,https://redd.it/57mg46,Gooseskin,The Mountain and the mouse.,"I stare into the mountain, thinking about all the activities and drop offs, pick ups and what not's that are happening now, all in a foreign language. Not that it affects me at present. 

The warm wind blows over my naked legs, I'm looking over my balcony listening to some of my neighbours talk about their new cars. 

I watch one lady open her iPhone. Then press the corresponding app to unlock the car. The other lady says to her husband that she saved 100 thousand by picking up the model without this and other automated features.

Living amongst such people sometimes make me feel sick. I quickly move inside and try to entertain myself in any allowing manner. I feel alien to other human beings. Devoid of empathy, just one thing keeps ticking.

I'm not dope sick. She's simply In every second thought. No program, person, picture, feeling or anything related to being normal is going to help me.

The thought has entered my head, and won't subside. It's like a maggot that has entered my skull. One that won't give up.

I'm living in a country that produces china white. I bought a bottle the other day from my connect, and the love has all sadly gone. A gram lasting 5 days is good.. Amazing product.

I'm not sick, the tropical heat sticks to my skin, but my mind is stuck. Stuck on that powder, that rig, that connection and that amazing blood stained personality.

My wife can see I'm agitated. Pacing around.  

She asks me if I'm ok. 

I ignore her and go into the bedroom, cocooning myself between two pillows to drown out noise from anyone and anything that isn't dope.

I guess I'm not going to be ringing anyone. I sent a few texts out to relatives, but they know what time it is here, nobody is going to help. They would have responded by now. And I'm not going to push them.

So I accept my fate. It's not like she's going anywhere, it's just gets me how much power she holds over me. It's more than I can explain. I Feel possessed. 

So it's going to be like this tomorrow. 

I think it's time we meet up again though, before the lights go out on Monday. After all, my finances will be in order. And I will be able to see her again, she's waiting for me, In the mountain.

Since that post I have come dangerously close to using but I haven't and I have a vivitrol shot on Monday- I'm going to get there. 

In the battles I've been fighting in my head- I keep thinking about working to return my life to functional normalcy and then resuming some sort of light use. 

The thing is- I have proved over and over again, you simply CAN NOT have it both ways. At this point it is simply a choice between working and taking some time and re-filling my life with everything I want my life to have. 

Getting a good job again, making good money, having happy relationships, getting physically back to where I was, and restoring self-confidence are going to come if I stay away from heroin. if I do heroin, I might be able to accomplish some of these, but eventually everything will crumple- I can not have them. 

So the question is- do I want that comforting feeling every night and continue to let these other things slip away? 

The answer is I don't know. One thing is for sure tho- I want to try getting those things back in my life so I can at least remember what it is like- to see if it is worth it to me. I can't make a determination until I have gotten to that point. 

I'm not trying to turn this into my recovery blog or anything like that and I'll probably shut up about this soon- its just a (fairly obvious) realization I've had recently. I'm actually excited to start working towards these things. ",1476542155.0

I have been on opiates for more than three years, the same amount of time I have been with my beautiful girlfriend. She happens to be a user, too, although her history of use is longer.

Four months ago my GF and I were evicted out of our apartment where we had been living in a haze of drug use for the eight previous months. I was lazy and did not pursue a job for some reason, and she also did not work. For the longest time, we procrastinated on our careers while getting by through various handouts and simple hustles. I, for one, expected a bailout on the rent from my parents, saving the apartment but it never came.

For the year prior to the eviction, the crap income from our hustles created a need to eliminate all wasteful use and had me subsisting on minimal levels of H with pieces of suboxone mixed in. In an average week, I probably used 2 to 4 mg of sub and 5-10 bags of H, with the day and order of use totally random and mixed up. This level of use meant that around the time of the eviction I was much more lightly addicted to opiates than the previous few years. My dependence was so low I would be totally fine and free of sickness on either 1-2 mg of sub a day or able to stay well on a single bag of dope. Given the eviction and the lack of gainful employment, my girlfriend and I decided it was time to try and take some time apart working on ourselves, with the focus on recovering finances and entering into gainful employment while I lived with my parents a few states away from where she'd be living in her parents' place. I got a sub doc and got by on 2mg a day, which I basically quit on my own around a month ago. Feel pretty good on a day-to-day basis now, to be honest...

The split seemed to have woken us up. Besides getting on subs, I repaired my relationship with my familty, found a job, worked hard, and experienced rapid promotion.  Meanwhile, my girlfriend continued using a fairly moderate but stable level H and also managed to find a job, albeit one out of her field and with a pretty low hourly wage. We have seen each other every few weeks and enjoyed each other's company and seem more serious about the future. During those time, my reflections on the past have me concluding that while I def enjoyed large and rarely consistent amounts of oxy and later H during the first two years of our three-and-a-half year relationship, I am certain that holding down a job, paying rent or a mortgage, owning a car and doing all that other Regular Life stuff is simply not compatible with anything except for total abstinence or at a minimum, a strictly controlled habit, especially in the long run. I also believe my past ability to get by on a tiny habit and my success last month in kicking my low dose of suboxone on my own and putting together a string of quite a few days first opiate- and now withdrawal-free indicate I am capable of absitnence or controlled use, especially with the terrible lesson of the eviction and the year without gainful employment fresh in mind.

In short, I feel like I am ready to apply for work in the area where my GF lives, get an apartment, and resume living together. I believe responsible use is possible, now that we both have our priorities straight, have put together a string of consistent work in at our respective jobs, have gotten by on stable doses of opiates, and have vivid first-hand experience of how much it sucks to have to move home and live with your parents. Of course, I could be wrong.

Does this all sound terribly naive to everyone? Has anyone on here had a wake-up call like this, especially one involving a SigOth, and successfully modified their lifestyle and drug use collaboratively? Or does the evidence point only in the direction of losing sight of our new priorities and what has to come first, before spending every remaining cent on an opiate habit? LMK...

I've been smoking H daily probably since like June... but started smoking in March. I would smoke up to like 6 points, got it down to 4 for the last while. I don't know. 

But I'm quitting now. Last smoked at around 10 pm PST. For the withdrawal I've obtained two 8 mg strips of suboxone as well as one 4 mg strip. I've been instructed to take half of an 8 mg strip as soon as I start to experience flu like symptoms. This would include sweating, goosebumps, runny nose, etc. Not until then should I take my sub. 

So I guess the point in me making this post is I want some advice as to what I should expect. I'm a late 20s male, pretty typical kinda slim size. idk. I've been smoking with a girl whose done this a dozen times, and she's guiding me through the whole process. But with the subs I should be able to get through it ok. 

What do you guys think? Am I in over my head? How long will this last? Should I get more subs? I don't know much about subs, I only recently learned people use suboxone as a different recreational drug entirely. I suspect I'll sleep a lot? During the day. I'm really scared and I'm really nervous about the process. Do you guys have any tips?

I tried to give you all of the information you'd need to understand my situation. I usually smoked every morning and every night lately. It became such a great way to unwind to go pick up a 4 point sack smoke half that night parked in the dark somewhere in public in the middle of the night, then smoke to get up for the day. Now I have none of it, and I couldn't even buy any if I wanted until Monday. 

So please, tips, advice, thoughts, anything. I have a great friend helping me, but I think this may be a great resource potentially for me, and I appreciate any help I might receive. 

Yours Truly, 

Pinafore

UPDATE:

So I made this post last night, probably 14 hours ago. This morning even though I wasn't sick I cleaned out my tudors and smoked what I had there.... I wouldn't say I got high but I definitely feel better. Part of me thinks it was stupid AF because it sets the sub clock back even further. 

But thanks for all of the tips and advice, I super appreciate it. Keep it coming guys. I'm so done with this shit. 


Update II: (lifted from comments section)

Well I took the suboxone today. Took a quarter of the 8mg strip at 810 am after going through a pretty shitty night but not a truly awful night. I slept with a sweater on and huge blanket and was cold the whole time. I was an asshole to my poor dog who just wanted to cuddle and sleep and I was like get the fuck away from me right now.
As I said, last dose was a pretty weak dose at 11 am Saturday. I made it to 8 am before I said enough was enough, and 20 minutes after taking that quarter, I took about half of what was left. In 2 hours I was feeling good enough, and I was praising jesus that the subs were beginning to work.
A bit of backstory: I take care of my disabled and dying father. He's not really close to dying yet, his prostate cancer prognosis gives him up to 5 years but I have to help him get around the house and get up outta his chair, etc. Today is the only day where I don't have to do anything, so I have to wd today. I went ahead and finished off the sub at 11:30 I'd say, and will not take anymore today.
My friend already got a sack fronted to her. She had taken the subs but she backed out. I was contemplating the same, but my dealer didn't want to front me today, which is fine. I'm lucky for it, because i would have used today and ruined the whole fucking thing.
Now that I've come this far, I am prepared to make it through. I can't afford to use at the rate I was using. I fucked myself financially for it, but I'll be ok.
Soooooo so far I am 28 hours removed from my last dose, 8mg subs in. I snagged 4 300mg gabapentin, however am hesitant to use them. Perhaps I'll take one or two tonight when I go to bed.
Any idea how much longer this shit is gonna last?

I've been going to this same facility for almost two years now, my clean date is February 27th 2015, and I've noticed a few odd things that go on at my outpatient. The main thing is that, on probably more occasions than I can count on both my hands now, my doctor has been giving people 1 week prescriptions because he's going on ""vacation"" when at the exact same time, he'll give other patients the normal two week script for their subs. On two occasions when he was supposed to be on said vacation, I've had to go in for one reason or another be it a meeting with my counselor or to schedule something, and he's been there, in his office, writing scripts as usual (he literally only writes prescriptions and teaches the occasional group, that is the entirety of his job, he was caught in a crack house in the 90s so I'm not sure if he's even allowed to do anything else). The reason this bothers me is because my insurance pays the clinic a neat sum of $157 every time I walk through that threshold for an appointment, and then multiply that by the 400-500 patients that go there and they are bringing in a nice amount just based on the people still going to the four day a week groups alone. So when you think about it, they benefit more when more when patients have to come in more frequently. Right now I only have to go in three times a month, twice to get my prescription for my subs and once to do a urine screen/meet with my counselor, and the only time I've ever seen him pull the ""vacation"" thing, is with other patients in the same boat I'm in, no longer going to groups. 

Anyway I just wanted to get your guys impression, another thing that strikes me as weird is they photocopy our sub scripts, and we can only fill our prescription for subs at the in house pharmacy in the building. So literally, I go in, see the nurse and do the physical, she sends the script information to the doctor, he sends the script to the pharmacy down the hall, I wait 15 minutes and fill it, and then I go back and give it to the nurse, and she literally photocopies every sub. The thing that strikes me though is the fact that, every time I see the doctor, I have to hand him my bag with my prescription on it, and he has never once checked the contents of the bag, hell he's never even OPENED the bag. Never counts them, never matches them up to the original photocopy made. It's just weird to me because I've never heard of another outpatient who does that and there are quite a few in my area.

Anyway that's basically it, you guys think I'm crazy or could I be on to something here?",1476518813.0

ill spare you all the details as im sure most of you are familiar with them.  wasn't a good ride.  im mostly physically better now, just a bit of a runny nose that I have to constantly blow, the runs, and and the chills.  the worst has passed.  I can actually walk around a bit now, and im forcing myself to eat even though I have no desire to.

anyway, as im no longer preoccupied with the horrid physical withdrawals, now the dysphoria and boredom has set in.  no interest in anything.  blasting music with my headphones slightly helps at times.

I'm in a situation where I hustle everyday and as many of you know, often money isn't the easiest to come by. My story begins on a Saturday. I got so lucky and was given some work to do by a neighbor I was insanly grateful. They for sure overpaid me and I was given $120 for my days work. Twenty dollars and a crisp new hundred. I spent ten that night ten in the morning, purposely holding the rest for Sunday which is my least favorite dope day of the week. My boyfriend asked to break the bill the next day, I said no, that I was going to break it at the store. He kept persisting and eventually I gave in and he went outside to get a rock for himself and get change. He was fucked up on xanax and unsteady. Eventually I came outside and we walked to the store. The rock man had never showed up. In the middle of a serious debate of which candy bar to get he asked if he had given me the money back. My heart instantly fell to the floor. I won't go to far into the whole ordeal but I pretty much broke down in the store. We looked everywhere I was so angry, so upset. How could this happen? Ot was such an awful moment. Feeling so good to being just crushed.

57jvdx,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/57jvdx/cbd_cannabis_detox/,9,https://redd.it/57jvdx,afakefox,CBD (cannabis) & detox?,"Hey guys. I don't know how much you guys like to smoke, but I'm def a pothead, no matter what I'll have my dope, cigs, and weed. I have the Leafly app on my phone and this week in its science section is CBD week.

There was a particularly interesting [article](https://www.leafly.com/news/science-tech/high-cbd-cannabis-pain-and-opioid-addiction) about how CBD binds to you dopamine, serotonin, and opioid receptors. Sounds pretty rad for detoxing to me. Has anyone used CBD with detox before? I actually ordered some for my vape and I'm going to try it when I attempt detox for the millionth time on Monday. 

What I'm wondering though is if it immediately helps with some of the detox symptoms, or of it's more like e.g. an antidepressant which takes weeks to months of continued use to get the benefits. I think the article has a bit too high hopes for how well it helps, I just cannot fathom it could get rid of any hardcore detox bullshit. I am curious to see if it will take the edge off what my other meds don't, namely restless leg/body symptoms, I can't not get high once I start to get them, my back spasms and sends this electric shooting pain through my whole body up my neck into my brain and ugh chronic pain bullshit whatever at that point I just can't NOT get something.

At this point I'm just willing to try anything that might help get off this shit, it has been so long since I was even sick before trying to kick. Just sooo long of heavy use every day with no breaks or tolerance drops, its the hardest time I have ever had stopping.

**tl;dr:** Has anyone detoxed with CBD or know much about it? I'm having an impossible time detoxing and am looking for any ideas to make it slightly less unpleasant (I have the major things already: suboxone, benzos, clonidine, trazadone, immodium) Is there anything else, homeopathic or not, that you've tried which helps you? Is there anyway to get Kratom in a state that never allowed it?",1476494515.0

WTF?,"So today I go in for my weekly visit to my sub doctor. He runs a tight ship, hence the weekly visits. I've been doing this since May and haven't dropped dirty once. The urine samples I give to my doctor are sent to a lab where they measure the exact levels of Sub in my piss so they can make sure I'm not selling mine or just not taking them. 

Anywho, today I get told by my doctor that my last urine sample tested negative for Suboxone. As in, nothing. Nada. The drug wasn't in my system despite me taking it less than 24 hours earlier. 

I really did take it every day leading up to the appointment. My levels in the past have been fine. I was kinda speechless sitting in that chair because my doc was pissed and I was blindsided by the news. He deals with drug addicts all day, I understand why he doesn't believe me when I try and argue against science. He got even angrier when I refused to fess up to relapsing or selling my strips, but I was honestly angry too. I took my half strip every day faithfully and still got written up for it. 

It's not technically the end of the world. They have a three strikes policy at my clinic as far as relapses and low levels go. I know dipstick tests are notoriously inaccurate, but I always assumed these lab tests my clinic uses were a bit more sophisticated than that. As a junky I realize my word means absolutely nothing to anybody. I felt like an asshole trying to plead my ""innocence"" but it was the truth! If I hadn't been taking my subs at all and tested negative for all other drugs too, why did I look completely healthy when I dropped the sample? Maybe he thinks I put someone else's piss in the cup, who knows.  

Has anyone else had a similar thing happen to them? I'm honestly hoping that there might have been some sort of mix-up but I realize those chances are slim to none. I'm sure many of you reading this are thinking I'm full of shit too. I'm honestly sorta nervous about my next piss test (a week from now) because if this happens twice more I'm fucked. I do not want to kick subs cold turkey. Nor do I want to break the news to friends and family that I was dropped from my clinic, especially with a story as ludicrous as the one I have now. At least if I actually relapsed I'd have the peace of mind of knowing that if I just do what I was doing I'll be back on my doc's good side, but now I don't know what the fuck to expect.

I just like anyone else would fuck around with some light stuff here and there when given the opoortunity. Of course sometimes I was interested in just what it is that causes people to do opiates as opposed to other substances. Well eventually I would start browsing this subreddit and just was amused and interested by some of the stories. Of course every day I would see the warnings not to ever start any opiates as you will end up an addict. I thought to myself, hah I can do anything and I can control myself. Boy was I wrong. A friend would toss me a few pills here and there for free as he had a bunch left over from a surgery. It was fun to take after a tough day and just wind down and sleep after, it started out as taking some pills once a month maybe even once every two months. After a month or two, I was starting to have more stress in my life and this is where I got my own pills for personal reasons. When I received my own pills I made a vow to myself, just this one bottle for the year, never refilling it. Ok so in my mind I decided I can get fucked up once every two weeks. Sounds great, well next thing you know after two weeks I am feeling like shitbanytime I am not taking my pills, eventually after just a month or two ago I am now eating pills 3-4 times a week. Eventually I run thtough wll my stash and I am not able to get anymore legally. Where do I go at this point? Where else but h, of course I get some great deald and decide to snirt it as oh no I can't IV it and then you keep going down the rabbit hole and it never ends. Then what, I meet a fantastic girl who does not know this dark side of me, no one does except a few close friends. All I do is sleep and work as without my fix I am good as nothing. Eventually start expressing real emotions with the female, tells me to quit cold turkey so you know, guess I had to. Got rid of anything I had for bad days and decided I would go sober, I mean how hard can it be? How hard can it be..? You know, you ever find yourself doing some dumb habit but can't seem to quit? Well yeah good luck quitting pills, powder, or tar. The first week of quitting I had insane anxiety, depression, night sweats, and so much stress, except when I was with her my mind was not on the opium. When I was alone my mind wanders back to that dark hole. Like all good things some do not last. Things fell apart and life goes back to where you were. Now after not long a couple weeks of staying clean what is on my mind, opium 24/7. I never expected myself to be in this type of situation and losing everything in my entire life to one drug. I mean I was positive I would not get addicted just eating a couple pills at the start. Guys, please if you have never started don't. If your doctor gives you a script and says you will not get addicted, you will get addicted. If you browse this sub out of interest, your curiosity will get the best of you and you will possibly end up addicted. Just once is all it takes to ruin your life. I just wanted to share my story and get the message out there to any lurkers or people interested in trying opiates for the first time. Just do yourself the favor and don't. Love to all of those recovering, currently still in that dark hole, and those who even visit out of interest.",1476462855.0
