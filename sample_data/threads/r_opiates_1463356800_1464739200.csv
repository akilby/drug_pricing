It's not like sweating caused by a good shot of dope is something I mind in and of itself, but there are plenty of times that it doesn't fit the environment and more importantly, isn't expected. Being 6'6 240 doesn't help either.  
It has a tendency to happen when the dope is really good or if it's a big shot but that isn't a rule. It would only happen with tar if if was a monster sized shot but I usually save big shots for home. It seems to pop up after the first shot or two of good dope when I'm out and about and it has a lag to it. After fixing up, I usually like to gorge myself on food. I fix up wherever else and be fine and go up to order without a problem but, twenty minutes or so after my shot(usually when I'm getting my food or something) I will be pouring sweat to the point where the cashier asks if I'm okay. Hmm.   
It's not too much of a concern when I visit people but recently it crept up on me while I was going to see someone at their new place. I try to avoid being self conscious and I assumed that the people there were chill but you know, I don't really want to introduce myself like ""Hi, I'm Dirtbiscuit, do you mind if I sweat on your couch?"" I generally keep a fresh change of clothes just in case if I'm picking up and then meeting people afterwards because of this. It's a bit annoying.  
So, my question is, is there anything that helps? Is it a histamine thing that benadryl could help with? I take dexedrine and first I thought it could be because if that but it happens with or without. Even more confusing is, it seems to happen with strong dope but not all strong dope. Maybe I'll just have to keep a bag of beach towels in the car and a small fan to plug in if I I visit people.",1463392963.0

Even though my use isn't super serious, or daily, and I don't have a gigantic tolerance, it's finally reached a point where it's presenting consequences in my relationship with my SO. 

I cannot afford for this to be the case. I love her more than anything. Even more than life itself. If I lost her, I don't think I'd be alive much longer. So I'm going to make an appt with a sub doctor or a methadone clinic. Mostly for the cravings, as with my current habit, I don't withdraw too severely. 

I have gaba for the anxiety, which really does help. It also does a decent enough job of limiting withdrawal symptoms I do feel, it just does not do anything for the cravings. I'm worried without moving to low dose subs or methadone to handle cravings, (Again since my habit isn't very large, and my tolerance isn't huge, I couldnt imagine needing more than 2mg of subs or 10-20mg of methadone,) that relapse will be inevitable instead of just a possibility. 

I know that the consensus is that unless I want to quit, and Wa t to do it for myself that it will not last. I also know that in this circumstance, I am mostly doing it for my SO, because I cannot bear to lose her. I realize in some ways our relationship is somewhat unhealthy because we are both very codependent, due to us both experiencing mental and emotional abuse, and in her case, physical as well, that's never really been treated. I've also been diagnosed with severe depression, she also has depression tendencies.

I have been borderline suicidal in the past and I really feel that with my depression as well, if I can't do this, and I lose her, my life will no longer have any meaning and I wouldn't be able to bear to keep going, and as I mentioned, I probably wouldn't be alive for much longer after that.

I will still always be willing to help out any of the friends I have made from this sub, both IRL and online. I will still remain active here, and on tinychat to keep you guys updated on how things are going.

I apologize for the wall of text and the shit post. Not to mention my depressing rambling. You guys really are amazing though. You have always given support and have kinda been here for me considering i seem to lack many friends IRL these days. I love you guys and want to thank all of you for kind words and support you've provided. Again I will continue to remain active, so I won't just be disappearing.

so, my boyfriend's birthday was on friday the 13th.. and he went up from our college town to his hometown (4 hrs away) so he could have dinner with his parents. he was only supposed to be gone 24 hours.. leave at 2 pm, be back around 2 pm. i was texting him at 11:30 that night, the last thing i said was ""you're the air i breathe, i love you so much..""

except i didn't hear from him at all yesterday.

so eventually i texted his parents around 6 pm because i was really freaked out.. and they're not cool with me at all. and then they called me, said ""we know about his drug use, we know about YOUR drug use..."" asked if i'd ever done heroin, told me i was lying when i said i wasn't high right now (no, it was all at your son's place, ugh) and basically that i will have no contact with him, and that he is ""getting help"". and that i need to ""get help"". they think i'm the reason he's on dope, it sounds like... when no, it's the other way around..

i am freaking the fuck out guys.. this is the love of my life. we might have done dope together, but i tried so hard for so long to keep him from relapsing.. and then when he did anyway, i couldn't bear to leave him because what if something happened and i wasn't there, you know? and then i got on the shit myself and just... I don't know man.

i want to speak to him again, i want to hear his voice, i want to hug him.. but i dont know if or when im gonna be able to do those things again. we both have summer classes starting next month.. but that's next month. 3 weeks. 3 weeks of not knowing anything... it's like he was here one moment and completely disappeared the next. i want to hear his voice so badly...

and then this morning his dad texted me again saying ""you agreed that contact with [him] would come through me. and now you've tried to go behind my back."" um... excuse me.. how?? i sent him (my boyfriend) a few texts this morning, basically saying how much i love and miss him and that wherever he is, i know he's hurting and that i'm thinking about him.. but i KNOW he doesn't have his phone. it just rang and rang and rang when i called yesterday. so it's not like i'm actually trying to contact him anyway... just hoping he'll read my messages of love when the time comes. i emailed my boyfriend a couple times too, just in case he checked it for work, idk if that's what he means.. 

as for me.. i'm on day 2 of detox, haven't had any dope in 48 hours. i came clean with my dad and i told him i've been having problems with dope, and he listened and he's accepting.. he's a physician so i have some good meds to help me thru it. but it doesnt even feel like anything compared to the worry i have for my baby right now. i fucking want some, yeah, to make all this pain go away.. but i need to be clean. i WANT to be clean. i want to be clean so his parents fucking accept me. and honestly i dont feel that bad.

 we were working our way towards being clean when all this shit hit the fan, too, which is the worst fucking part... i was tapering, or weaning i guess, i don't know, just doing a little tiny shot every time i felt sick and it was working. but he did way bigger shots than i did and i know he's hurting HARD right now. :( my baby.. he wasn't ready to get clean yet so whatever bullshit they're making him do, i know it's not going to help.. they didn't even say if he was in rehab, or if he's just on lockdown in his house.. he's 20 years old for christ sake, he's not a fucking child.. 

sorry for venting guys. i'm really stressed out right now. i don't know when i'm gonna talk to him or see him again... and i still havent responded to his dad's text because i dont know what to say... everything was fine 48 hours ago. but now he's just... gone

My brother's been a heroin addict for 3+ years. The family and I have gone through all the typical addict motions (multiple rehab, therapy, psychiatry, stealing, pawning-off valuables, car crashes, getting in debt with bad people, etc), and at this point I'm sure that he'll never get off of the stuff, so I've decided to help him hide his drug use from our parents until he gets a bad batch and overdoses (hopefully teetering on the brink of death would give him some much-needed perspective).

I've been thinking about putting a baby monitor in his room (without his knowledge), so if he ends up choking on his own vomit, I'll be able to hear it at least. But there still remains the issue of him injecting too strong of a dose, and falling into a deep sleep from which he'll never wake up. I'll need some sort of heart-monitoring device/service, but I don't know how I'll do it without his knowledge.

The reason I'm helping him hide the stuff from our parents is because my mother works a stressful-ass job as an ESL educator for high school-age students, and coming home to another overdose scare would put too much strain on her already weakened heart, and frankly I've grown tired of all the sobbing and yelling that doesn't do anyone any good.

ive recently graduated to shooting up. been chipping for about a year or so now so im not a full time user. ive banged coke a whole lot of times before so my technique is not an issue but im not really sure how much i should be injecting as im used to smoking it.

im doing it on my own and lacking a bit of confidence, so im finding myself doing 3 or 4 injections before im where i want to be, as im worried about doing too much. and even then im topping up every say couple of hours or so. can anyone advise me the kind of dosages i should be working on? im in the UK so its afgahni #3 btw.

Ive also just ran out of citric acid and wont be able to get any more for some time. i know it can be dangerous using lemon juice but is it ok from time to time? or is it something that i shouldnt even consider?

ive also been thinking about becoming a daily user. the way i see it h improves my life in many ways. i do a pretty boring repetitive night shift job, when im high i find im more productive and happy, i also need less sleep and dont feel tired which is great as im usually seriously fatigued no matter how much sleep i get during the day. its an office based job and sitting on the computer for 12 hours straight gives me some pain in my lower back arms and legs, h obviously sorts that out.

i also find myself not drinking or using coke when high, so is being an addict really that much of a problem? as long as i keep my job i dont see it being. and even then if i do need to quit i can just get some subs and do it that way right?

ive been through benzo withdrawal a few times and i got through that, and its supposed to be worse than opiate withdrawal, so ive heard. admittedly ive only had some very minor opiate withdrawal symptoms from binges that went a little bit too long. say 5-7 days or so. i found the sweating and hot and cold flushes really annoying.

Here is the thanks in advance.....THANKS <-- but much louder,"So I used to take ativan for my anxiety but here's a run down of how I (ab)used to ativan, just like the doctor said.

A.) Once there was just enough Coke(drug) up my nose to make me wanna die, and think I was, I would chew 3 ativan 1mg. Drinking some Goddamn water I would feel better in a few hours. B.) Once there was just enough dope to be high but not noddy (naughty....get it...ehhh weak) I would chew up 2 or 3 1mg ativan to get to a good place. C.) When I was 3/4 the way into a bottle, just me, of Jack, and nearly outta coke, I would get my last Coke, swallow 3 1mg with a shot and chase it all down with Coke(cola)

So now I wonder, without all the other drugs, if ativan have rec value alone. I obviously don't remember taking them, or how they made the high feel, if they GOT me high. I want to know if they have rec value for myself. Also I wonder if my girl if in WD....

I had my last fun a week ago and am off my subs for 3 days now! I feel amazing! 

It may sound like a lightweight but my daily dose was 180mg of oxycodone IR, 10-15 Nurofen pluses, whatever Norco I could scrounge up on top of that plus daily pod/seed tea and 200mg of Tramadol and shots of liquor before bedtime to help blend it all together. I have no idea how much that all costs but I was paying a lot of money everyday and I have a decent paying job.

I was in the airport on my way out of town when the first WD kicked in and it was fucking fierce! The hotel room looked like a tornado hit it when I left and the flight back 3 days later was like living in hell and getting prodded with a burning anxiety spear every 20 seconds while sitting between two strangers who must have thought I was psychotic since I couldn't stay still for 2 seconds to save my life. I never thought I would get through that but looking back on it I am very happy and excited and looking forward to trying to get back to the life I want to live. I'm also oddly happy that the pain was so intense because it added to my resolve that this shit needed to end; I do not want to go through that again.

One reason I was able to power through was with microdoses of suboxone (.5-.25 mg) once I got home to permit any sleep whatsoever and constantly reminding myself how I can be a better husband and father once I'm clean!

I've been using opioid drugs for 5-6 years and recently came off a two-year stint on dope using suboxone. This is my fourth day taking subs instead of getting high and I feel fantastic on about 2 mg, maybe 1.5. It took a lot of sub to get ""over the hump"", though, for the first day or two.

Anyway, I've used suboxone as a maintenance drug in the past, and I'm wondering whether it would be better to use my last three subs to do a ""quick taper"", or whether I should get some kratom and use that for a couple days after the subs are gone. I've used kratom to come off subs before, but that was after over a year of taking them daily and a long-ish taper down to about 0.25 mg/day. For those of you who've done a sub quick-taper after having used them for maintenance in the past, does it work, or does it extend the withdrawals? Would anyone recommend or not recommend kratom, based on personal experience?

We decided we wanted to do it once more, you know how it goes. My girl has been in jail also which made it harder to find any. But I found a cool dude who hooked it up with better shit than I've ever seen in my current area. 

Anyways we get home and we're trying to hide it from a friend we had over and our roommate. Well I go up to do some and he seems okay, very high but okay. After I do mine, he's laying on the ground and I thought he was just enjoying his high, so I kiss him before I go to the bathroom to clean up. He's responsive and nothing seems to be going wrong. But after two minutes I come back in and he is turning grey, and I start scrambling to find the narcan that Tracey sent me in the mail about two weeks prior. I didn't know how to use the shit so I call up my friend, who has been clean for almost a year now. I have my roommate call 911 cause I didn't want to take any chances. After CPR and two doses of narcan he wakes up. But the cops and ambulance are already on their way. I thought for sure that he might be going to jail. But the cops were really nice. Although my fucking roommate gave them permission to come inside they didn't even search the house. Just gave a pep talk and left. 

Oh yeah, and I guess I got lucky, because in between my boyfriend taking the shot and OD'ing, he insisted he wanted to shoot me up, but was so fucked up that he got a huge air bubble in there and squirted out like half of it. If he hadn't I very well could have been right there next to him. 

I'm so fucking grateful that Tracey sent me that gift in the mail. The EMTs may not have even made it there in time. And it allowed me to stay calm rather than freak the fuck out. This would have been the third person close to me to have died from this shit in the past three years.

Ive been allowed to go to the dr myself and get it the last couple times. But this time, Im seriously considering not getting it.

Im torn between recovery and getting high again, and dont want to prevent myself if I want to get high that bad. Then again, I dont want the consequences that came with using before, either.

I think the shot is personally a bit cruel, it removes free will (I couldnt decide not to get high on my own, but thats what my iop is for, to make me want to stay clean). Im not supposed to be on it much longer anyways, but Im thinking of quitting sooner.

My problem is, I worry my SO will find out somehow that I didnt get it. I dont even have a way to get high right now; I have money but no connect right now. I also fear ""the rabbit hole"". I want to have the peace of not using, but using feels so peaceful too. I dont know if Ill get a connect or not in the next month, but trying to get one could tip my SO off.

Would you stop taking vivitrol for a chance to possibly get high again, or take it and prevent any negative consequences? How does an addict make this decision?",1463543739.0

I've never liked Xanax - took it a few times when I was a teenager, acted like an ass, and passed on it ever since.

I've been with my GF for years. Her mother used to send her .25 and her friend used to send her .5 Xanax every once in awhile - she was mostly fine on those - every once in awhile she would take 2-3 and she would quickly get what I call the ""Xanax attitude"". The other day I got some of the 3mg bars from the DNM's. Sold most of them, but she kept some (Why the fuck did I tell her I had them?) 

The Xanax attitude cannot be reasoned with - nothing is every her fault, and everything - I mean everything, is my fault. And it's SO easy to set off an argument. Oh, you didn't catch that yellow light, and now you have to wait at the red light? It's my fault because I asked a question 3 miles back - and now she is bitching because she has to wait. Oh, i didn't hear what you said and I asked: ""What?"" - oh, I'm getting an attitude, and is a piece of shit - no, I just didn't hear what you said.

And now she is running low and asking if I can get more - I cannot say no, I'm not going to get you more because you have a constant attitude (she will say it's not the Xanax, and it's my fault somehow - but we are fine 90% of the time when she doesn't eat Xanax). So I told her that the guy stopped selling them online. Thankfully she doesn't know how to use the DNM's. I can't wait for them to be gone.

P.S. She isn't the only one that can't handle Xanax. My mother can't (haven't talked to her in about 5 years), and basically anyone I've ever met hasn't been able to take Xanax and act like a normal human - I'm sure there are people that can, but they are an exception to the rule.",1463517511.0

I did my suboxone induction.  I'm going to be taking 8mg per day it looks like.  Had a rough day trying to stay clean long enough to safely do this without the precipitated withdrawals.  

I haven't had a really horrible thing happen to me to hit rock bottom, but I know that my wife is ready to go if I keep up the way I have been going.  I don't want to lose her, don't want to lose my kids, and I need to calm down my life a little. 

It has been really nice not spending the whole day trying to hustle up 100 bucks and texting and calling to try and get someone to meet for those beautiful little blue pills.  I did sub for about 3 years from 2011 to 2014 but got off with a little pressure from the wife.  As soon as I was off I was back on the train, looking for pills non stop.  Got caught a few times during the next year.  Did the IOP thing for 6 months.  I wasn't able to stay clean longer than 8 days the entire time I was in there.  I used synthetic piss or diluted like crazy to pass.  Tried the meetings during that time and after I finished the program.  I still just couldn't stay stopped.  I want to, but the call is just too strong right now.  

So, I have been looking for a sub doctor for about a month.  My previous doc was full, so couldn't get back in with him.  I think that was actually a good thing.  He was super lax, just come back when you need to and get a refill.  Never pushed meetings or therapy, never really even talked to you that much.  The doctor I was able to get in with genuinely seems like she cares about people getting clean.  She has a rules list, pill counts, drug tests, therapy sessions, required group sessions, etc.  I like her so far.  Right now I'm not sick, I'm focusing on work, I'm not stressing out about getting a dboy on the phone.  I am the closest thing to being happy that I have been in a long time.  

I really hope I can stick this out for awhile and get out of the life, out of the hustle, and back on track.  I'm too old for it to all fall apart.  

No one really knows about my habits but my wife and my dboys so I just wanted to vent a little here.  I love reading about everyone on here so I feel like I'm part of a community even if it's not an active dialogue or anything.

Shooting up dope and meth thru my picc line in the bathroom of my hospital room. Signing out AMA halfway thru my course of antibiotics to embark on the bender of all benders. Overdosing and needing my beautiful poor boyfriend to narcan me right to the point where I need another shot. Fever of 105.9 (didn't know it was possible but trust me, i got there). Back to the hospital. ICU for 5 days, vital signs shockingly poor. Doesn't stop me from signing out AMA again. Boyfriend crying. Begging me to go back. My parents and baby dad telling me to think of my daughter... don't they know how hard I try NOT to think about her when I do this shit?  
  Sorry, it's really hard to organize my thoughts. My temp was at least 104 at almost all times for several days, several times. It's called ""sepsis"" or ""septic shock"" kids and you will die from it. I think I've been right on that edge more than a few times since march and I think it is an awful way to die from what I can tell. After writing it out, I am thinking that there's just no other person in the world dumb enough to hear multiple doctors say ""if you sign out AMA right now you will absolutely die from this infection"" then sign out any way. More than once.  
  I think part of me thought I was that miracle who would get lucky and it would clear up on its own. Another part of me only cared about the right now.. I wanted to get high right now, fuck this hospital I can deal with it later. A third, dark, part of me didn't give a fuck if I died. Maybe that part of me even wanted to die. The life of an addict is hard.. this felt like an opportunity to just take the easy way out, as I always have, and disappear forever leaving behind the legacy of my baby girl and the sense tragedy and sadness surrounding my memory that comes with dying young. That's selfish though.  
  The last time I laid in bed, near death, fever at 104.something, my boyfriend got angry with me at some point. He told me that he hates the fact that I just do whatever I want, leave a tornado of destruction in my path, and expect everyone else to deal with the mess I leave behind, while I'm already working on the next disaster. He told me if I wanted to die, fine.. but he wasn't gunna around for this disaster. So he told me I had two choices: keep him and come back to the hospital or lose him and die alone. Can you believe I actually needed time to decide??  
  I chose the hospital. But don't get it twisted, this story doesn't have any happy fairy tale conclusion. I was in the ICU for my birthday, my dude cheated on me that night, I'm a huge pussy and the opposite of cooperative with the doctors. I have a central line right now and I shoot up dope and meth into it. I'm battling the urge to go AMA again. My daughter comes everyday though, and that makes everything better for a little while. I'm taking it a day at a time but i think I might start taking it an hour at a time cause days are long.  
  Don't know who I wrote this for, but hopefully it was entertaining for someone. Def not gunna get corny and sat I wrote it for myself though, like to express my feelings or some shit, because that was almost painful to write... like cringey. I'm a dumb ass with my choices, and I can see that 100% even when I'm making them.. but I do it anyway. Any insight on what my issue is here would be appreciated.

A recent post has made me think, and I'd like for someone very knowledgeable (like MD or PhD level) to answer my questions...

When you take a dose of lets say heroin for example, there's a certain amount, a certain level, in your bloodstream. This determines the high one feels right?

How do the receptors in the brain get activated? Does the heroin lock on, and hold it's place? If so, the remaining molecules in the blood would continue to lock on until all the receptors are activated, and the heroin in the bloodstream had no more receptors to attach to. Is there a concentration gradient involved, to make a larger dose more effective? Or do they (opioid molecules) constantly activate and then bounce off the receptors immediately, with resulting high again determined by a concentration gradient? 

Does losing the high have more to do with the heroin taken out of the bloodstream, as opposed to the receptors deactivating? I imagine the answer is yes? I'm guessing the opioid doesn't actually lock on, but activates and frees up immediately? And the concentration effects how often and on how many receptors this occurs, translating to effects?

It's hard to explain what I'm asking, but I was thinking about naloxone, and wondering how it all works. The way it's explained seems far simpler than the actual reality of it. Basically, what I'm wondering, is how at a given dose, the opioid molecules in the bloodstream don't continue to leave the bloodstream gradually, until as many receptors are filled as there are opioid molecules available.

I'm trying to imagine why there would still be heroin in the bloodstream, but not all the receptors activated in the brain. How do people get high safely on a certain dose, yet another is dangerous? Is an overdose level where most or all of the receptors are saturated? When naloxone is given, does it literally ""knock"" heroin off a receptor, or merely help take up receptors temporarily, and being an antagonist, help reverse the effect? And being an antagonist, does it literally cause an opposite contradictory effect with neurotransmitters to reverse overdose, or merely not allow an opioid to exert it's effects?

I'm sorry if this doesn't make any sense, I know this stuff is pretty complex, much more so than the standard way it is explained. Any insight would be greatly appreciated.",1463645757.0

Four years ago I drove my uncle, who is like a brother to me, to the ER for a heroine overdose. He made it out okay but at that time my family and I knew there was a problem at hand that we couldn't quite come to grips with how to deal with. He'd been in and out of rehab because he wanted to quit but growing up in the ghetto of southern California with a sick mom (where he would originally get his opiates) and no dad he didn't really have the best support network for recovery and would always inevitably relapse, which no one but me really understood. He would become nearly excommunicated from the family with resentment from his 5 brothers and a mother who became an enormous enabler. I always understood that it was not something he was in control of and the addiction was the root of the issue, not personal weakness or the judgement of just not wanting to quit enough. 

After another detox attempt the typical withdrawal symptoms set in and things got pretty rough that culminated in a fight between him and his mother finally said it was enough and called the police and as you could assume the past few years he's been in prison. After keeping in touch and following him through is journey of regret, resentment, acceptance and an innumerable amount of dabbles in spirituality he's finally being released to a halfway house this month. 6 months there and then he's on his own.

I've already ran it past my girlfriend and let her know all the tear filled details about what happened and she's completely open to becoming the center of his support network and boarding after he leaves his halfway house knowing all the difficulties that might come. 

This is where I need you guys. What and how can I set up to be the best support for him to help prevent relapse when our entire family nearly all have turned their back on him. I just want to make sure he stays clean and prospers. He's completed college credits in prison and I've set him up to go to the same community college I went to in order to continue a pursuit of education. 

I just want my brother back and don't want him to go down the same road, obviously there's way more that goes into someone's decent to opium dependency that I can't fit here so if you guys have any questions feel free to ask.

(Article is behind a pay wall so I give you the full text here.) (Warning: It's long but FUCKED UP and worth reading.),"*TL:DR version in the comments.*

**Introduction**

The following is based on a true story. A pseudonym is used to protect the privacy of the nurse practitioner (NP). This NP ran her own private practice and dabbled in pain management. The article addresses the raid on her practice and the subsequent investigation by her state's board of nursing. Emphasis is placed on standard of care violations asserted by the board of nursing, defenses maintained by the NP, and standard of care practice tips that can be learned from this case.

**SCENARIO: A PRACTICE UNDER SIEGE**

It was a typical morning at the office for Rosemary Whitford, an NP who ran her own family medicine clinical practice. Her husband, who served as the office manager and receptionist, had just turned on the computer at the front desk and walked back to the kitchen to get a cup of coffee. The office assistant was checking the examining rooms to make sure each was stocked with necessary supplies. Nurse Whitford was putting on her white jacket and placing her stethoscope around her neck. In the waiting room, the first patient of the day, an elderly woman with a history of hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes, had just sat down with her caregiver, who had driven her to the clinic. All was as it should be, until it wasn't.

With no warning, the front door to the clinic burst open and 6 shadowy figures streamed into the waiting room. Nurse Whitford heard a commotion and a pounding on the door that led from the waiting room to the offices. She reached that door just as her husband opened it to investigate the disturbance. The couple was met with pistols and assault rifles wielded by intruders in ski masks and dressed entirely in black.

With the muzzle of his rifle only inches from her cheek, the stranger closest to Nurse Whitford ordered her to lay face down on the floor and put her hands behind her back. Similar commands were shouted at her husband and the nurse assistant. As Nurse Whitford quickly complied, she glanced past her captors and saw the elderly lady in the waiting room struggling at gunpoint to get down on her hands and knees. The caregiver was already prostrate and could do nothing to help her.

With her body flat on the floor, Nurse Whitford felt powerful hands pull her arms together behind her back and lock her wrists together with a restraint. Now she was completely helpless and knew there was no escaping what she believed was her imminent death. If these robbers were brazen enough to lay siege to her office with potential deadly force on a normal business day, then there was no reason to believe that they would spare their victims. Her mind raced from thought to thought as she pondered how this could have happened and how she was about to lose everything she had strived to accomplish over many years, but mostly she thought of her 3 teenage sons and how they would survive without their parents. She closed her eyes and prayed.

Nurse Whitford was jarred from her prayer when she heard shuffling as her husband and the office assistant, both with their wrists bound behind their backs, were lifted to their feet and led to the waiting room. Nurse Whitford was pulled from the floor and directed in a similar fashion. The captives were instructed to look straight ahead and not to talk to one another. A masked gunman stood in the doorway while the other marauders holstered their weapons and began moving file cabinets, computers, and servers from the office.

Eventually, Nurse Whitford was taken to her own office in the back of the building. There, she took notice of the identifying insignia on the clothing of the gunmen surrounding her. She recognized for the first time the large letters ""DEA"" emblazoned on their flak jackets. Only then did she realize that these were agents of the United States Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA). Although these officers likely identified themselves and their intentions upon entering the premises, Nurse Whitford had been too frightened to hear what had been said.

A woman entered the room wearing black boots, black pants, and a black flak jacket but no ski mask. She identified herself as a DEA agent. She then interrogated Nurse Whitford. A tape recorder lay between them to catch every word that was spoken.

The DEA agent told Nurse Whitford that they knew she was writing unauthorized prescriptions for controlled substances. She displayed a document that purportedly identified every recent prescription written by Nurse Whitford and demarcated those prescriptions that were controlled substances from those that were not. The DEA agent said that 55% of the prescriptions written by Nurse Whitford over the past 10 months had been for controlled substances. Nurse Whitford believed this allegation was wrong; she knew that 80% of her practice was devoted to family medicine and only 20% of her practice involved pain management, but terror stole her voice and prevented her from demanding her constitutional rights, including a right to an attorney.

Although Nurse Whitford was never told that she would be arrested and taken into custody, she assumed that this would be the case. She feared for her 3 sons and what would happen to them if she and her husband were taken to jail with no opportunity to see them. She could not control her trembling. Nurse Whitford had to see her children. She would do anything to cooperate if it meant she would get home to them.

Toward the end of the interview, the DEA agent said, ""You need to surrender your DEA certificate."" Nurse Whitford was not advised that she had a choice in the matter. She believed she had to surrender her DEA certificate or her business would be shut down, and she would be imprisoned. Nurse Whitford complied by signing a document that relinquished her authority to prescribe controlled substances. The agent then stood up and removed the controlled substance license from the frame on the wall where it was hanging. By that time, 2 members of the Texas Board of Nursing had arrived to observe the events. Shortly thereafter, the raiders left Nurse Whitford's office, taking all of her computers and all of her patient records.

This raid effectively destroyed Nurse Whitford's practice. Without the medical records or the computers, she could not send out bills for past medical treatment. Her ability to rely on her records in treating repeat patients was impaired because she no longer had their records to review. More importantly, she no longer could prescribe the most effective medications to her patients suffering from chronic pain. All she could do was limp along while the investigation into her practice plodded through the DEA and eventually through her state's board of nursing.

In retrospect, the chance of a DEA raid on Nurse Whitford's practice was a greater risk than she ever appreciated. For good or for bad, pain management is viewed by the DEA with some degree of skepticism. Nurse Whitford's decision to enter the field of pain management opened to her a means of helping an often overlooked patient population in desperate need of help. It also provided her financial avenues previously unavailable, but it was fraught with peril she did not fully consider. 

**BACKGROUND**

Nurse Whitford worked for many years as a registered nurse in various office and hospital settings before returning to school and getting a master's degree in nursing, which landed her a job with a local pain clinic. After less than a year, Nurse Whitford left her full-time job at that clinic so that she could start her own practice. However, she continued to work part-time at various physician-run clinics to provide a steady income and to gain experience. These jobs included work at pain medicine clinics.

Nurse Whitford's family medicine clinic focused on providing care to the underserved. As an immigrant from a third world country, she was all too aware of the inequality in medical care that plagues the poor, and she felt that she could make a difference. Over the next 2 years, Nurse Whitford grew her practice to a full-time job and stopped ""moonlighting"" at other clinics. Soon thereafter, she made the fateful decision to expand her practice into pain management.

Did she need to venture into pain management? No. She was well aware of the skepticism that often plagues the pain management industry. She knew that ""pill mills"" existed and even knew some physicians who had run into trouble with her state's medical board because of their questionable pain management practices, but Nurse Whitford saw firsthand the pain that some of her patients suffered and the legitimate need they had for competent pain management. In addition, pain management provided an economic resource that was all but impossible to attain as a clinician devoted to treating the indigent. Consequently, she was willing to offer pain management to those patients whom she felt were truly afflicted.

At all times, Nurse Whitford had a physician supervising her clinical practice. Never was pain management more than 20% of her practice. The vast majority of her patients and income came from the family medicine side of her practice and was unrelated to pain management. But that didn't stop the DEA from raiding her office, and it didn't stop the nursing board from building a case against her.

The complaint ultimately filed by the nursing board included a 37-page report by a board-certified anesthesiologist and former president of the state's pain society. This report cited that over an 8-month period, Nurse Whitford issued nearly 600 prescriptions for controlled substances to nearly 250 patients. The report outlined her prior affiliation with pain clinics, her lack of training as a pain management specialist, her spotty documentation of patient complaints, and her use of medication cocktails that are known for abuse and the potential for overdose. Records from 2 patients were selected specifically to serve as the basis of the nursing board's contention that Nurse Whitford was running a pill mill.

Nurse Whitford hired counsel to defend the accusations pending against her. She wanted desperately to preserve her advanced practice nursing license and to regain her controlled substance certification, but the complaint was dispiriting and the evidence daunting. She knew that she faced a long and difficult struggle and that her future in health care was at stake. Defense of the claim was compromised by the fact that 2 of the physicians at the pain clinics where Nurse Whitford worked previously had been sanctioned by the medical board for issues similar to those now alleged against her. In addition, the supervising physician for her clinical practice was under investigation by the medical board in relation to her conduct. This made that physician less than cooperative in defending the claims levied against her. Ultimately, Nurse Whitford's defense lay in the medical records she kept and the manner in which she ran her clinic when compared with a stereotypical pill mill. This information was essential in countering the allegations made against her and in picking apart the report of the nursing board's expert.

**PREEMPTIVE MEASURES INFLUENCE DEFENSE STRATEGY**

The first step in Nurse Whitford's defense was to distinguish her practice from a pill mill. In general, pill mills share the following characteristics: 1) long lines or big crowds form to see a doctor; 2) groups of several people arrive in a single vehicle to receive pain medication; 3) armed security guards protect the facility; 4) pain is treated only with pills and not other clinically proven pain management methods; 5) patients choose their own medicine, often with no questions asked; 6) doctors direct patients to a specific pharmacy where it is likely that they will be asked no questions; 7) medical records and x-rays are not requested or required for a prescription; 8) patients are told when to come back to receive more pills; 9) doctors do not provide physical examinations; and 10) the clinic conducts business exclusively in cash.

Nurse Whitford did not have long lines or big crowds at her office; she saw only 5 or 6 patients on average per day for pain management. She did not have several people arrive at her office in a single vehicle to receive pain medication. There was no armed security guard present. Although she did treat her patients with pills, she also encouraged exercise and other modalities to address their pain. Nurse Whitford decided what pain medications were appropriate for her patients; these patients did not choose their own medicine. Her patients were not directed to a specific pharmacy; they weren't directed to any particular pharmacy. Nurse Whitford routinely requested radiographic reports at a minimum to substantiate patient complaints. Patients were not told when to come back to receive more pills; they were told to come back as needed. Nurse Whitford conducted physical examinations at every visit. Although most of her pain management patients paid in cash, she also accepted other methods of payment. In short, Nurse Whitford demonstrated that her practice looked nothing like a pill mill.

Nurse Whitford also described measures she used to avoid patients who were merely drug seekers. Each patient seeking pain treatment was required to sign a document stating that the pain patient was not currently using illegal drugs, abusing prescription medications, or selling controlled substances. In addition, the pain patients completed a psychiatric profile that Nurse Whitford used to determine whether there were psychological factors that might influence her treatment.

Nurse Whitford gave sworn affidavit testimony that pain management was never more than 20% of her practice. At the peak of her pain medicine practice, Nurse Whitford saw no more than 25 to 30 patients per week for pain management. New patients were instructed to bring in medical records that substantiated a diagnosis consistent with chronic pain. When Nurse Whitford prescribed pain medications to a patient, she ordered a urine drug screen before the second visit to ensure that the patient was actually taking the prescribed medications and was not selling them on the street. Thereafter, she ordered routine urine drug tests to confirm patient compliance. In addition, she ordered periodic liver enzyme studies to assess whether there was any liver damage from the medications.

If a patient's urine drug test was negative for opiates, then, pursuant to the terms of her pain management contract with the patient, Nurse Whitford would no longer see that patient because that conduct evidenced diversion of the controlled substances prescribed. If the patient acted drowsy or incoherent or otherwise acted in a manner that led Nurse Whitford to suspect doctor shopping, she would contact the state's prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP), a state-based registry of prescriptions for controlled substances, and obtain the patient's prescription history. There were several occasions during this period when the prescription records supplied by the PDMP reflected doctor shopping. Nurse Whitford demonstrated that she discontinued seeing those patients well before the DEA raided her office.

More importantly, Nurse Whitford's charts on her pain patients reflected care that went far beyond prescribing opioids. These charts contained medical records and films from prior providers that substantiated the complaints of pain reported by these patients. They also reflected a medical history and physical examinations consistent with chronic pain. It was particularly significant that the records revealed that Nurse Whitford treated conditions in her pain patient population that had nothing to do with pain, such as diabetes, hyperlipidemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and hypertension. She also recommended physical therapy and exercise as an adjunct to the pharmaceutical treatment she provided for her patients' pain. 

**RESOLUTION AND TAKEAWAYS**

At the end of a long and hard-fought battle, Nurse Whitford entered into a compromise settlement agreement with the board of nursing. This agreement preserved her advanced practice nursing license and her ability to operate her clinic, and it eventually will lead to the return of her controlled substance prescriptive authority. Although the evidence supported Nurse Whitford's position that she was not running a pill mill, she ultimately acknowledged that she did not have specialized training in pain management, that her medical record keeping was at times inadequate, and that a drug cocktail she occasionally prescribed posed a substantial risk for abuse and overdose.

Nurse Whitford's decision to settle with the board of nursing was based on several factors including 1) the substantial financial cost of defending the case through an administrative trial; 2) the amount of time that the process would take; 3) her knowledge that she could not regain her controlled substance prescriptive authority until the investigation by the board of nursing was closed; and 4) the inherent uncertainty that comes with leaving one's fate to a nursing board hearing, especially when the decision makers at the hearing would include the very persons who were accusing Nurse Whitford of malfeasance.

There are several lessons that an NP can take from Nurse Whitford's experience. First, pain management is a tricky area of medicine that comes with a host of potential pitfalls. Pain is a complex process that is nearly impossible to assess objectively. The cause of pain (eg, nerve root impingement) and the physical signs of pain (eg, lordosis) may at times be easy to identify, but the degree to which they cause pain cannot be assessed other than by patient report. Pain tolerance also can vary from person to person. Pain can have a detrimental effect on persons, including impaired function and emotional distress. To that end, inadequate treatment of pain can be just as deleterious as overtreatment. That's why it is essential that the NP have a solid understanding of pain, the resources to treat it, and the potential dangers its treatment imposes.

The goal of pain control is to optimize comfort, improve function, improve the quality of life, and reduce morbidity, but a clinician can be deceived into prescribing to a patient who seeks pain medication for reasons other than pain. Likewise, a clinician may deny a patient pain medication even though a legitimate need exists. Vigilance in patient assessment is required, but even the best clinician can be mistaken. Ultimately, the clinician must exercise clinical judgment and do what he or she thinks is in the patient's best interest. Those who go into pain management need to do so with both eyes open. They must be cognizant of the possibility that the DEA will be second-guessing their judgment.

An NP should expect the DEA to have computer programs that can detect certain prescription writing patterns such as patterns consistent with what one would expect in a pill mill. A valuable resource for an NP who wants to provide pain management is the Model Policy on the Use of Opioid Analgesics in the Treatment of Chronic Pain published by the Federation of State Medical Boards.[1] Highlights of its recommendations as well as the recommendations of this article's authors include the following:

1) Understand pain, including the relevant pharmacologic and clinical issues, and structure a treatment plan that reflects the particular benefits and risks of opioid use for each individual patient.

2) Only practice with a supervising physician who is versed in pain management, preferably one with specialized training in the field.

3) Avoid supervising physicians who have been disciplined by the medical board relating to pain management because they can be targets of future investigations.

4) Incorporate safeguards into the practice to minimize the risk of misuse and diversion of opioids and other controlled substances.

5) Obtain medical records substantiating the patient's injury and pain treatment history before prescribing pain medications. The medical records should document the presence of 1 or more recognized medical indicators for pain treatment. Order additional studies as needed.

6) Use ""profile"" questionnaires such as the Screener and Opioid Assessment for Patients with Pain or the Opioid Risk Tool to help identify patients who seek pain medications for illegitimate reasons.

7) Be wary of patients who travel long distances for pain management.

8) Perform a thorough patient evaluation before prescribing an opioid medication. This includes an assessment of the nature and intensity of the pain, past and current treatments for the pain, any underlying or associated disorder and condition, and the effect of the pain on the patient's physical and psychological functioning.

9) Assess the patient's social and vocational environment to determine supports and obstacles to treatment and rehabilitation. This should include an assessment of the patient's personal and family history for alcohol and/or drug abuse. When possible, interview the patient's garner additional information from the patient's family and/or significant others.

9) Screen the patient for depression and other mental health disorders because patients with untreated depression and other mental health problems are at increased risk for misuse or abuse of controlled mediations, addiction, and overdose. Consult an addiction specialist, when appropriate, before initiating opioid therapy.

10) Document all examination findings as well as all discussions with the patient, the patient's family, and/or the patient's significant others. This documentation should include a written contract that outlines what is expected of the patient and what is expected of the patient, including circumstances that will cause the practitioner to dismiss the patient from further medical care. It also should include informed consent documents that outline in details the reasons for the treatment, the risks associated with the treatment, and the limited benefits of the treatment.

11) Establish a treatment plan and goals as early as possible and revisit them frequently, so that clear-cut objectives guide the therapy.

12) When appropriate, combine the medications with appropriate physical therapy and/or an exercise regimen.

13) Avoid ""cocktails"" known for abuse and overdose.

14) Focus on the ultimate goal of pain treatment—management of the patient's pain while effectively addressing other aspects of the patient's functioning, including physical, psychological, social, and work-related factors, and mitigating risk of misuse, abuse, diversion, and overdose.

15) Query services, such as the state PDMP, that allow health care providers to identify those patients who are seeing multiple physicians for the same problems.

16) Schedule the patient for follow-up care to ensure that the prescribed treatment is having its desired effect.

17) Institute periodic liver profile studies to ensure that the prescribed medications are not having a toxic effect on the patient.

18) Institute periodic urine drug testing to ensure that the patient is taking the medications rather than selling them on the street.

19) Trust your instinct. If it doesn't feel right, don't do it.

If the DEA should pay a visit, the NP can expect a harrowing experience that includes weapons aimed at point-blank range accompanied by a threatening verbal barrage. Although the event will be terrifying, the NP needs to maintain composure and cooperate with the investigation. Under no circumstances should the NP admit to liability or sign documents that result in the surrender of one's controlled substance prescriptive authority. The DEA raid is primarily meant to gather evidence for future use and possible prosecution, so an arrest may not occur. That doesn't mean that the NP must communicate without first consulting an attorney. Indeed, having access to an attorney versed in the applicable laws is strongly advised.

DEA raids usually go hand in hand with an investigation by the state board of nursing. Therefore, the NP's insurance carrier should be notified as soon as practical. If coverage is provided, the NP usually has choice of counsel. Hiring a competent attorney is paramount to achieving a satisfactory resolution of any charges that are levied. It allows for the preparation of necessary defenses before a formal complaint is filed with the board of nursing. Unfortunately, not all NPs carry insurance coverage for this sort of action, and attorneys can be expensive. However, the alternative, potential suspension or loss of one's advanced practice nursing license, likely will be more expensive in the long run.

I've been an Oxy/Percocet user on and off for six years. My addiction, like many, goes through cycles of being clean and being high for months on end. When I am on my high tide, I gain an extreme amount of weight without changing any eating habits. The worst gain was going from 150ish lbs to exactly 287 lbs in 10 months. When I got clean after that high tide, I went back to my normal weight in less than a year. 

Guys, my body has reached the point where it cannot stretch back and forth anymore. The stretch marks are getting out of hand and looking obese is not fun at all. Has anyone else experienced this? Or does anyone know how this can be stopped?

Those of you who middle, why do you choose to commit such a felony then?  I would guess you don't have jobs, but theft up to 500$ is a misdemeanor, it seems you would be better off stealing than middling. Do yo make a lot of money middling?  I don't see that as being sustainable as your customers will leave as soon as they find a direct connect.

Anyway my dude will usually meet me at the train station. Today he said come meet him a few blocks away. So I start walking. I turn the corner and walk a block and i see 4 cop cars and two officers talking to two guys. I can't just do a 180 so I keep walking towards them. As I get close my stomach drops. It's my dealer theyre jamming up. He says something to me as I walk past and I acted like I didn't hear and said nah man and kept it moving. 

I keep going and I'm like fuck he's hit, I'm hit for coming all this way. And figured they made me as his sale. White guy in a shitty area. I go Into a bodega and get a soda while deleting everything off my phone. There's no other way back to o the train so I had to walk back that way. But I took a more rounded way, and low and behold I see my dude walking. They didn't find the bun I was buying. 

So I get my shit and head back. The cops are all still there and didn't say anything. Feel like I caught a big break.

Been clean around 7 weeks.  Going to be getting 2 points (.2g) of H later today.

No need to tell me this is a terrible idea as I already know it is, but the plan is to use only today (haha)

My question is - If I fuck with this shit just today I shouldn't become physically dependent again should i?

Also I've only fucked with H once in my life before - pharms were my thing.   2 points will be good enough for a day of relaxation with no tolly - but is it to much?  Obviously it depends on how strong/what the H is cut with but basically what I'm asking is will 2 points likely last me more than a day?  As I only want to do it for the day.

Things always seem to work out in ways unexpected. Either it's a good friend lending a hand (or a line), a d-boy willing to front you until payday, finding a perc in the junk drawer or a deal so fine you almost feel bad about it. Almost.

I copped 2 g's over the weekend. I figured it would last me until payday, in which I would make the same deal. Nope. I blew through that shit like white on rice. Accepting monetary donations in return, I gifted some to my friends, putting a huge damper on my supply. On a side note, you ever notice how the friends you do dope with always know when you cop? Like, I'll be heading back from the city and I'll get a call ""Yo, Skaggg, you got anything you wanna get rid of?"" (And look, I don't sell drugs, but I like helping my friends, I never buy weight with the intent to sell. So, as much as I'd hate to give anything away, I always tell them sure, and hook them up with a couple points.)

Anyways, I did the final line last night, I'm completely out. I have about 50 bucks I can spend, but I don't like buying small amounts, it's not worth the ride. A real fuckin dilemma. Lo and behold, my friend hits me up, he's got some dilly 8mg, said if I bring him 20 bucks for gas he'll hook it up. Fuck ya. He usually gets rid of them for 20 a pop, so I'm expecting 2, one for today, one tomorrow, just enough to get buy and have a pleasant day at work.

I meet the Dilly dude at the hospital where he was filling his script, I throw him cash and he hands me 4 of those fuckers. I couldn't believe my luck, I walked into a goddamn gold mine. Buy one, get 3 for free. Some next level Aldis deal.

I found a pack in my car once that a friend dropped when  I was super dope sick, I found a pack next to my coffee table in my bedroom other time when I was super sick and I usually don't lose my dope. But the best of the best was when I was getting free tar for awhile (which is rare in this area as it is) but I had used a glass when I was putting it into a nasal spray bottle (I didn't shoot at the time). Well I had a bag in there which caught some of the dope and I just sat it on my tv stand and forgot about it. It technically shouldn't have had anything in there and I'm horrible with cleaning up after myself.. Well Months.. probably even a year later I'm sitting at work at i get a skype message from my boyfriend who tells me that he thinks he found some dope and he's really fucked up.. WTF. I ask him about it and he said he scraped the cup on top of the t.v. stand and there was tar that dried to it. I told him he better save me some and after I came back from lunch I was pretty fucked up for the rest of the day! It was nice. :P

Also just talked my boy into stopping at my work to drop me off some packs so I can get some work done so instead of waiting 3 hours I just have to wait 1. Hope everyone else's day is going great!",1463751891.0

I'm a long time lurker of this sub, and I guess I'm finally creating an account (don't want my other one linked for obvious reasons) and posting this because I know you guys can relate... I've been using opiates for years, but I've been an addict for just over two years now, and by some miracle I've managed to keep it a secret from everyone in my life. Everyone except my ex boyfriend of six years who also uses. And honestly, as weird as it might sound, its very isolating to have this secret weighing on me. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad it's a secret, and I know that everyone in my life would be utterly shocked if they knew the truth. But at the same time, I feel like one of the biggest aspects of who i am is known only to me, and it's kind of lonely.

I just recently moved across the country, and I haven't really made friends yet. As a result, in order to feed my habit, I have to rely on my ex boyfriend to send me whatever he manages to get for me from my hometown through the mail. And he rips me off, I know he does. But I can't complain because I don't really have any other choice right now. And in order to get him to do it I also supply his habit as well. I have the money, so I don't mind I guess. It is what it is. I'm a regular in the mail room at my work, always popping in when I see that beautiful update on the postal tracking info saying ""Delivered"". I guess it's also just nice to know that there is at least one person in my life who knows my biggest secret.

I'm not really at a point where i want to stop. Hopefully I'll get there some day, but not now. My job is stressful, I'm depressed, insert a myriad of other excuses, but... I'm an opiate addict. Man, it feels good to say that ""out loud"". For now, it's part of who I am. It makes me feel good. It makes my life... better. You all know what I mean.

I guess this is mostly a pointless post. I just wanted to introduce myself and finally join this community that I have lurked in for so long. You guys make me laugh, make cry... but most of all, you make me feel like I'm not alone. So thank you for that. And... Hello. It's nice to finally say hello. Even though you guys don't know me, I feel like I kind of know some of you just because of how long I have lurked here. I just want to not feel so alone anymore, to feel like I am part of a larger community of people who understand. ",1463750676.0

He was unconscious within 15 seconds. His eyes closed and he fell forward. 

He didn't totally stop breathing,  but with his sleep apnea,  his airway gets obstructed. So he was suffocating himself. 

We didn't have any narcan,  so I called 911 and kept breathing for him until the ambulance got there. 

Had I not breathed for him,  he would have died. 

Because of the overdose  we were kicked out of the place we were staying. 

Oh,  and after, 3 days the company I started work for decided I wasn't getting tasks done fast enough and let me go. (the recruiter said it wasn't even my fault. He believes the company has unrealistic expectations) 

So,  my boyfriend almost died,  we got kicked out,  and I don't have a job. 

We slept in the car last night,  and probably will for some time. 

Im thankful for the vodka I have. Maybe I can drink my self unconscious today. Because fuck everything. I'm done. I give up. ",1463749620.0

There seems to be a plethora of information about the mechanisms behind the physical dependence but I havent been able to find much regarding psychological addiction.
  
I've recently started dabbling in opiates and I find I can't stop thinking about them. I can't really make sense of why that would be. In my oppinion, they are less enjoyable to me than other drugs I have done but for some reason they are in my head all of the time.

I've been awfully quiet lately, used to be pretty vocal under a different name but about 3 months ago I started on subs with a super sketchy doctor. I never used while on it, and it probably saved my life. I'm not here to preach about subs though because I know they don't work for some people and are unavailable to others. Today at my appointment I told him I wanted to lower my dose and that it's really saving my life and he said that he would help me get off it when the time was right. He then writes my script and brings it out to the lobby with him (weird). In front of everyone, he says it will be my last time seeing him. When I ask of it was something I did wrong, he says no but he is shutting down operation. I talked to a few of his patients outside afterwards and he said the same to them. Apparently he was really sketchy prescribing a slew of other meds too. We decide to go back in and demand refills since he boned us, to which he surprisingly obliged. I can't believe I picked today off all days to have him lower it, that extra half a strip would have helped me stockpile enough for my next decision. I'm not sure if I should ween off and quit, or spend the next few months finding the cheapest doctor I can. It just sucks because I blew through so much money for the first few months, seeing him weekly 150 out of pocket each time. This was the first time that coming since he decided I only needed to come monthly. I'm also working 6 days a week now, so I don't have the time ( or money now that I'm taking care of old bills) to got through that process all over again, even though I may end up doing it if it's what's best. Any input would help. 

TL;dr - doing well on subs for 3 months, my doctor shuts down most likely due to pressure from the Feds since he's so sketchy (cash only, lots of other meds offered, absolutely empty office, minimal drug tests). Should I ween or bite the bullet and go through the process of finding someone new. ",1463723178.0

It was, ""how do relationships work between 2 junkies?""
 
This is how it was for me, and my girlfriend. And this is kinda our story of our road to recovery. We've only been off it for two days really now. It's really long. Read it or don't haha I think it may be a mildly interesting read? Let me know anything y'all think.

I've been with my girlfriend for about two and a half years. I was using when we started dating. Addicted, in fact, but it was IV pharmaceutical opiates at that point. She has so much love in her heart. She was always supportive of me. But at one point, my use got to be a problem. I told her I'd try to stop. And I tried. But then I closeted my use for a while. It did make me slow down, and it kept things manageable for me.

I eventually, however, told her that my ""sobriety was too hard."" And being the sweet, loving girl she is, she let me slowly get back to it. And then I stopped hiding my use. And it got worse. And worse. But she stayed, through my very, very worst. Always there by my side. It got to heroin. And it got to every single day.

In October 2015 (still quite recent), I convinced her to use for the first time with me. IV, 15mg of morphine. She had a crazy, wonderful, euphoric experience. And she never wanted to stop. And just like that, she was right there with me. Day after day. Not only was all my money going into it, now hers was too. It was a horrible, awful, selfish thing for me to do.

We kept going. But we stayed together, through it all. The trick was to be honest. I came clean about everything I had done behind her back over time. She loved me, and although a lot of it hurt her bad, she was happy with my honesty. Another thing that kept us going was sharing fairly in everything. All money, all drugs. Not mine. Not hers. Ours.

We started living the junkie life together. Both of us hustling money for the next fix, day after day, together. We also both worked, which helped quite a bit. But it got so, so out of hand. I live in a large southern state. A big state. And I had business to attend to in a city on the beach. We decided to take a mini vacation! Fun, right? Well, we ran out of our dope early. So I hit up dboy from the beach. ""I reup at 8am tomorrow."" So what do I plan to do? I get up at 3am, to leave at 4am to be in town by 8am, to buy the dope, and drive back to my girl at the beach.

Well. I was driving. And driving. And I was going fast. Because, it was the middle of nowhere, and there wasn't a car, building, or artificial light in sight. I was going around a curve at 120mph, like a dumbass. I looked down at my phone for one second. And I was in the grass. Then I overcorrected. And it was wet. And I spun one way. Then the other. Then back. I tried to steer out of it. No avail. I spun. And spun from the left lane, over the right lane, through a ditch, over a two lane frontage road, then into the grass. There was nothing to hit, so I stayed upright, but spun 720°.

I had time while spinning to think about everything. I thought about my family. And my girlfriend, on the beach, who would get a knock or call from the police or a family member. I though I was dead. I was sure of it. But my car stopped spinning. I made the trip, got my gram, and came back to her on the beach. It may be the happiest I had ever been to see her beautiful face.

I'd say ""wake up call."" Haha. Well, I was ready to quit long before she was. But since I got her into it, I decided I'd stay by her side, and let her keep using. And use with her. And cop for her. And keep her safe.

She eventually got to the point of being ready. And I got an intervention from family around that time. Yesterday I had my suboxone induction, and she's going cold turkey. She's doing better than me with going off of it so far. She's a sweetheart. She's the best. I couldn't do it without her. 

To answer the question, the trick to a junkie relationship is complete honesty. And trust. And love. Her and I have been through a lot, all my fault, always. But we've never been happier. Never been closer. At least, that's how it was for me.",1463722216.0

4k3bal,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/4k3bal/damn_what_a_week/,13,https://redd.it/4k3bal,HinTX,Damn what a week,"So I'm laying here, finally able to relax after last week. This might be a wall of text but here's a few things that have been going on:


I was going to a trade school which I knew I wasn't going to stay the entire time. I got called into the clinic on site, thinking I was going to have to take a piss test since I used a bottle of month old piss to pass the initial test. But it was the results from the blood test. They told me there was a 50/50 chance I had HIV since the first test was positive and the second came back negative. Took some more blood and still waiting to find out for sure.


So the next day I took off first thing in the morning and took the bus up to the state capital. A guy I went to rehab with last year lives there and insisted he could put me up for a few days. I let him know i was heading his directon and i still haven't heard from him. Really didn't have a plan, just playing it by ear. Got to talking to the bus driver, turns out he's lived in my hometown. He's a cool dude and drops me off closer to where I needed to be. 


Through some junkie networking, someone was waiting to help me out with some tar. Walk a little ways, meet up with guy, and head on down the road to wait on his guy. Finally he shows up and we head inside the grocery store to get right. The family restroom is occupied, shit. We go into the men's room and go into adjoining stalls. Start to get down to business and someone comes to check the stalls. He lingers there and I see him looking in. It's pretty obvious what we're doing. ""Prisa adictos!"" Haha holy shit you don't have to tell me twice. Pack my shit up, tell dude I'll meet him outside. Walking out of the bathroom and towards the door is a cop just chilling. My asshole puckered up as I smiled and kept walking. 


Dude and me head over to the nearby McDonald's and get to talking. Someone he knows just got burned for a ball of some tar and still wants to pick some up. He comes picks us up, and do the thing. His friend is pretty cool and drops me off where the needle exchange van is going to be later. I find a nearby park and pass the time smoking a little tar. 


The van shows up a couple hours later and I get some clean works. Sit around talking to them, helping put some cookers together. I ended up riding with them to their other stop and finally part ways. Make my way back to the park I was at earlier to try and get some sleep. There's a couple there, ask if they mind if I camp out there with them, all is well. 


The next morning, the 3 of us get up and moving. Start making our way to the soup kitchen to get some grub. On the way though, slim and I go into a hotel to get some coffee (which was the best damn coffee I've had in a while). So as we're making our cups, the guy working at the counter is probably suspecting we're up to something. Asks us what we're doing, if we're staying there, blah blah blah. Slim and I played it off pretty well if I do say so myself. Anyways, we make our way downtown. We get there and bullshit with a few people there for a while.


After eating, the 4 of us now head off in search of drogas. The couple starts arguing and head off in a different direction. So it's me, pulling a suitcase behind me, and another guy, carrying a big ass sword, walking around downtown. He wants to find some fake bake and says he knows just the spot. Now this part completely blew my mind. There is an entire city block with 200-300 people openly smoking the shit. Not even 3 blocks from the police station! Wtf! 


So dude finds the woman that is selling the shit and trades his sword for 2 blunts. He lights one up and starts smoking. Stats spacing out, there is a damn cop car right in front of him. The cop sits there for maybe 30 seconds and drives off. Fuck that shit, tell him I'm outta here, and take off. Shit is way to sketchy for me. By now it's getting dark so I head back to my little camp in the park. About halfway there is the capital building. I stop to take my boots off and catch my breath. While I'm there I made up and did a shot because shit, i wanted to be able to say I got high in front of the capital. 

 
This is a lot longer than expected. My bad everyone. Ok so I made my way to the park and found out my sisters dad was in a motorcycle accident running from the cops. Decided I should head home instead of bumming it there. Make my way to the greyhound and get my ticket for the next morning. Got to talking to a couple guys outside and one of them pulls out some decent tweak, hell yeah. 


Next morning I'm waiting on the bus and I see a friend from the school I was at. He couldn't hang there either and was heading home. We hop on the bus and start the 3 hour ride back to familiar territory. Damn did it feel good to be back. I had a ride set up and everything was planned. Once I got there though, he found out that i didn't in fact have money on me but at my house. So he starts bullshitting me around since the only reason he was going to get me is to make money off me. He wasn't planning on taking me home, just halfway and wanted the whole $50. Oh well so I started walking the 40 miles. I make it oh maybe 1/10th of the way and it starts pouring down rain. I took shelter at a gas station and a couple guys smoked me out.


Several hours later I get a ride and homeboy from earlier is riding with hoping I have money for him. Nope I wasn't able to pull anything out of my ass. We end up going to where homeboy and his girlfriend, my best friend, and another friend and his dad are all staying. 5 people in a 2 bedroom apartment turned tweaker den. This is where it starts to get crazy.


We make it there and I end up getting stuck. Well shit, but the friends dad is ok with me staying there for a couple days since he likes me. They're about to move out of state and need the help loading the uhaul. Good deal. 


There's a knock on the door and the friends dad let's him in and they disappear into the bedroom. He leaves and the dad comes back into the living room with a lo and a big bag of shards. I don't even care for the shit but put it in front of me and it's over with. 


I realize this is way too long and I'll go ahead and end it. We all start tweaking, homeboy from earlier starts talking shit to everyone but me because his now ex that's there is sitting outside bullshitting and smoking with me. We are all up tweaking for 5 days, everyone is up everyone else's ass except mine since I'm just trying to chill. Girl and I each do a shot and take off to get donuts. Homeboy starts going crazy, breaking shit, making death threats. Again to everyone but me, and when I asked him to tell me what's up he starts kissing ass. Start loading up the uhaul with best friend and some AB skinheads pull up talking shit and pull a gun. Saying best friend better watch out and he's a snitch blah blah blah. He dgaf since he's leaving the state in a few hours. 


So now I'm finally laying in bed, caught up on sleep and food, enjoying this mornings methadone and smoking a cigar. My bad for the wall of words and gibberish. It was definitely an interesting week to say the least",1463675418.0

I've engaged with my local drug and alcohol service, and was prescribed buprenorphine yesterday. I was to start taking it today, but the chemist I picked up my buprenorphine from didn't supervise me taking it so I was able to take it home. I was hoping to start Monday but the doctor who prescribed it said I should start today.

Basically, although I've been using mostly poppy tea, I have a bag of heroin I was going to use (one last time, y'know how it goes). Does anyone know if UK services screen for usage while on buprenorphine? I'm hoping I can use today, and take the buprenorphine sometime tomorrow and hopefully avoid precipitated withdrawals. Have an appointment on Tuesday, don't really want to have to explain why I was using heroin rather than what I was prescribed, though I am worried about precipitated withdrawals from the poppy tea regardless of the heroin I have, I'm not even in withdrawals yet :S

tl;dr Do UK drug services have random drug screenings?

He wrote me a script for 45 8mg strips and informed me it would be difficult to get any more than that and that I should do everything I can to make use of this supply to completely taper off.

I've been taking 1.2mg of sublingual fentanyl as much as every four hours, Opana ER 2x30mg in the morning and Opana ER 2x40mg at night. My last dose of Opana was 22 hours ago and I just took my last dose of fentanyl a few minutes ago. I tried searching online but couldn't find any good estimates based on these doses and ROA for when I'll be ok to start taking Suboxone. I found mixed info for Opana and nothing for sublingual fentanyl, only patches which last much longer. My doctor only told me to make sure I was in withdrawal, but mild withdrawal starts within a few hours for me. I can barely make it through the night recently without waking up to take some fentanyl. How heavy into withdrawals should I be or about how many hours should I wait before taking Suboxone?

My taper schedule is to start on either 8 or 12mg depending on how much it takes to keep me well at first and then cut by 2mg every 3 days until I reach 0. Does this schedule sound effective and what sort of negative effects can I expect? Is there anything I can take to help alleviate the effects? Would ketamine, for example, help with physical pain and depression while tapering? What about switching to kratom at some point or using it after tapering?

I was also told to stay away from benzos specifically, but have never had an issue with popping a bar of Xanax while on a full dose of fentanyl and oxymorphone. Going into this I was expecting to be able to get some help with anxiety from Xanax or Klonopin as I still have to work and be functional during the day. Is there really more risk with Suboxone and benzos?

If anyone has any other advice that would help make tapering (and staying away from abusing opioids in the future) easier I would greatly appreciate it.",1463817824.0

But 10 seconds after shooting I became extremely red, felt as though I was dying, sweating like a mad man, etc. I knew it was coming as soon as my stomach started feeling strange after I pulled the needle out. I don't know how but I got sent into terrible wds. Thankfully it only lasted about 15 minutes total, but fuck that was a scary 15 minutes. I truly thought I was going to die.

I am in the way back of an 80s work van. The seats are removed. There is a man named Jonny sleeping in the drivers seat. He is from Poland. Life took a turn for the worst for him and heroin is the one truly in his drivers seat. Sean sleeps in the passengers seat. Two girls are on a mattress where the rows once sat. I am crumpled up like yesterdays newspaper in the way back. The backdoor is not functional. We dont know how we dont get towed. I like to think the van, with California plates, was used once in a mob hit and left forever. Police know we are junkies but they dont want the bother of it all. We may have bugs they say. 

No one knows anything about the van other than the fact that we dont know anything. Like hepatitis C or a good story, it was passed down to juliana, our leader, by a homeless friend named David. David died just weeks before i arrived in the Rotten Apple. I never knew him, but feel as though i have. He is just one of many who jail killed. His cold turkey withdrawal and ultimate release reset his tolerance. He went out on a cloud and now plays Guitar for Junkie Jesus in heaven. 

It is a beautiful morning. I am able to find the beauty in a world of sorrow. I am happier in this moment than most before or after. For a man who survives by holding pieces of cardboard, fighting back tears while sitting on cold concrete and staring vacantly at shoes pass by, this is a miracle. 

I savor the quiet. Its too early to do my wakeup. But ill pay the pesky piper later. My stomach is rumbling. If i dont use now ill have to go make a boulderous bowel movement and i cant wake up my beautiful girlfriend as she sleeps. Sleep is the only time we arent in hell so i want to let her savor it, living as the person she would be if she didnt want to escape the prison of self so badly.

I flick the three Gucci stamps, ensuring every last crumb falls to the bottom parts of the bags. It took a few disasters for a Boston boy like me to master the act of fixing with stamps. I take out my trusty spoon. He is one of my best friends. Our relationship is a very simple one. 30 units water, no flame required. I draw up my potion with a piece of cigarette cotton. I ought to quit those things. I fasten my tourniquet, and partly wish 3 was enough to sleep forever. I draw back and complete my ritual. Hoping this feeling in my stomach will go away soon. 

Thousands of normal people speed towards more normalcy as they complete their morning ritual above me on the BQE that provides us cover from rain and enough privacy to live our lives in peace. I think of where i would be had it been a little different. If i didnt need her love so much that i needed to understand her addiction. If i hadnt left UMass. If i had just turned right instead of left.

As i smoke the half smoked American Spirit i had acquired in a Williamsburg ashtray. I wonder what my mother is doing. I am the lucky one, i grieve my spiritual death under a blanket of evil warmth. She experiences it fully. And loves me still. A mothers bond with a son is stronger than anything else.

As i reminisce and the sun fully rises, the cold dew of the van windows recede, and i realize a sharp pain in my stomach. Its been 10 minutes since i dosed, i should be back in my happy place. A fantasy world where bowel movements are not needed. I try to relax for a minute and forget the pain but it persists. 

Panic sets in. I need to shit. Badly. Like right now. Emergency backup plans set in. Newspaper? I need a fucking plan b. I am not going to be able to make it. These girls are going to fucking flip out. Fuck my life. You see the back door is locked. In order to go run to the porta potty inconveniently located 4 blocks away, i must crawl over 2 live humans. 2 very cranky morning girls, and junky girls at that. 

I realize its now or never. I clumsily hop over the final row, dazed, half awake reactions groan out of angry vanmates mouths as i scramble to open the door. Its loud as fuck. I run past the middle eastern livery cab drivers like my life depends on it. After an olympic sphincter workout,  i make it to the porta potty and unload my uncharacteristically soft stool on the sorry porta potty. Construction workers at their job site look at me as if i have escaped from Bedlam, but my business must be attended to.

I stop at Dunkin Donuts on Bedford for a coffee. I like to see the normal people, the privileged college students, the trust fund artists, and the beautiful girls who stare through me as if i was transparent. I dont quite look like all these people, but im not too far gone. One day i will blend in. One day i will wake up at 8 and go to work and complain about traffic and football and my babies sleep patterns and the weather and all those other mundane things i dont understand.

I walk back to the van, the crew must be getting ready for the day now, and they are probably worried. I have a long day of holding cardboard, and staring at shoes. Ill be normal someday, but not today.",1463805053.0
4kbs8r,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/4kbs8r/advice_on_iv_fentanyl_use/,8,https://redd.it/4kbs8r,PM_ME_YOUR_MORPHINE,Advice on IV fentanyl use,"Before tonight I had smoked fentanyl patches on a number of occasions. I found the rush to be strong but at the same time it reminded me of crack in that the urge to redose not long after using was very strong, and the high itself felt empty and unsatisfying despite being incredibly strong. It also seemed expensive considering how short the high was. 

I was in a situation where I was forced to cold cop, and there wasn't much available to me. Somebody was trying really hard to sell me a 100mcg patch of fentanyl (I already forgot the brand name, but ""ratio"" was the one I was used to and understood to be the easiest to abuse around here, and it definitely wasn't that) for 40$. He's telling me this is an incredibly good deal but I'm already skeptical and preparing myself to be ripped off just because of how hard he was trying to sell this patch to me.

I try smoking a little bit and it really doesn't work very well, it smells bad and my lungs hurt (it was hard to separate the drug from the plastic part). So I do a quick search for how to prepare an IV shot.  [I found this](http://www.aivl.org.au/wp-content/uploads/Injecting-Fentanyl-Minimising-The-Risks.pdf) on top of many vague warnings about how dangerous it is. 

I follow the instructions in that pdf, and boy oh boy. I was incredibly pleasantly surprised. The high felt fuller than when it's smoked, I was able to re-wash small pieces of the patch and still get nice hits and it seemed to last a lot longer than I expected. All of the sudden I felt like I had got an amazing deal on this fentanyl patch, because it seemed like it was going to more than last me the night.

So I guess my question is - what should I be worried about? What are the big risks I'm taking by doing this? As far as ODs are concerned, I feel like this is even less risky than heroin shots just because it's easy to determine how big my shot should be and although not as consistent as hydromorphone, it's more consistent than heroin. 

Turns out fentanyl patches are cheap here and this might very well become a regular thing for me (I'm used to doing hydromorphone because it's my favorite and also much cheaper than heroin over here). I don't feel like I'm getting higher than I would with hydromorphone - I'm doing a dose that translates to my regular dose in either heroin or hydromorphone. I also have easy access to the vitamin C dissolving powder so that's not a problem. I suppose it's important not to overuse the vitamin c (it doesn't really feel like I need much, and it only hurts very slightly when I inject) and it's also probably important to keep the patch as sterile as possible as well as not heating the water too much during the prep. But all in all, it seems like all the horror stories I've heard about the dangers of IV fentanyl seem overblown. Isn't it only really an issue when the fentanyl is cut with the heroin unbeknownst to the user, and thus making it really easy to overdose? What should I be concerned about? Is this really any different from shooting dilaudid and heroin the way I usually do, as long as I engage in all the harm reduction I engage in anyways? Is the PDF guide I found (and linked to in this post) giving sound advice?

Thanks for any tips. ",1463798968.0
4kbowl,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/4kbowl/the_cliche_of_staying_clean/,42,https://redd.it/4kbowl,CodeRed23,The cliche of 'staying clean',"As an heroin addict (currently on methadone but still use dope semi-regularly) I have been through my share of recovery and rehab programs and visited countless drug forums. A common theme is listening to or reading about people's struggles to lead a stable life without opiates and how they invariably ""fail"". People will say ""I cheated today"" ""I failed again"" ""I was clean for x days/months/years and fucked up and relapsed"" etc. These themes come up so often they are a cliché like the projectile vomiting withdrawal scene you know will happen in every junkie film. The implication is that a) you are a failure or morally unsound if you are not 100% abstinent and b) using is dirty, unclean, shameful. 

I call bullshit on all of that. 

This (N. America and other Prohibitionist nations) is a society where it is perfectly legal to smoke treated tobacco products that are known to be carcinogenic and cause lung disease, it's okay to drink alcohol, a physically addictive neurotoxic substance that is extremely harsh on the body and we accept that tens of thousands of people will be killed each year in motor vehicle accidents. The government even makes money taxing booze and smokes while at the same time saying don't smoke or drink. Yet a heroin/opiate user is treated like a weak willed, diseased, morally degenerate failure who made ""bad life choices"" and ended up addicted. Slight double standard? 

A binge drinking frat boy who date rapes his way through college is more acceptable to society than a junkie.   Smokers die horribly and prematurely every year and are not condemned as weak and burdensome wastes of space. Comedians can make a living glorifying their alcoholism and many many people are functioning alcoholics but never quit long enough to notice (or they are in denial). How many times has a drunk person who can barely walk or talk said ""well aleasht I 'don use drugsh ok"". There is no moral hierarchy of drug users. It's a fiction pure and simple. The bottom line is the criminalizing of drugs kills and ruins lives and there is logical or moral reason why this must be. The vast majority of dire problems faced by opiate users are directly related to prohibition.

Statistics show very few heroin users are able to abstain for life. Yet they are forced into a cycle of shaming and self-loathing and a significant number kill themselves rather than go on like this. The goto ""treatment program"" in North America is the 12-step cult from the 1930s or ""rational recovery"" and various talking groups. Their success rate in keeping people 'clean' for 18 months or longer is not even in the double-digits. Methadone and suboxone work well for some people but not for others. And why are these opiates okay but the ones that give you a buzz are not? It's the bullshit moralizing again.

The rehab and recovery industry says they are all about support and a non-judgmental stance, and some are, but most people still feel like ""failures"" and ""cheats"" and ""dirty"" if they can't, or don't want to abstain for life. They are getting their cues from somewhere. Of course parents, partners and society in general don't help either. Pharmaceutical quality opiates are almost harmless if used carefully. 

The biggest health concern is constipation and a high fiber diet usually fixes that. Yet giving a heroin user a prescription for their drug of choice is still beyond the pale in the United States. Canada has moved forwards on this and the data shows it is a success if saving lives and letting people integrated into society is the goal. The data from European countries that have similar programs has shown that for decades. Portugal decriminalized all drugs in 2001 and the predicted chaos and drug tourism and kids smoking crack in grade school never materialized. In fact, addiction rates are down across the board.

The writer William S. Burroughs was an opiate user on and off for most of his life. He lived to be 83. Jack Kerouac, a chronic alcohol user, died at age 47. One anecdote is not proof, but is there any doubt a daily heroin user will almost certainly outlive, by a considerable number of years, a daily alcohol consumer? We accept the alcoholic, the smoker, the reckless driver, a person who  is dependent on prescription meds, even weed is becoming less taboo but that courtesy isn't extended to opiate or other 'hard drug' users. 

Opiate users who can't or don't want to quit are not degenerate failures at life but just unlucky to be dependent on a drug our hypocritical drug loving society has arbitrarily criminalized. If you as an opiate user are a weak and defective individual who has only themselves to blame for becoming addicted, well, so are all the people who ""decided"" to become addicted to legal substances. Oh but there is a difference, they cry. Yes, there is indeed, and it is that users of some drugs are allowed to use and obtain them legally, while others are punished for the exact same behavior and forced to put their liberty and wellbeing on the line by dealing with the black market and all the risks and dangers that come with it. 

So, no, it's not you...it really is them. Realize that and call out the hypocrisy and double standard at play here. Most people probably don't even think about why they so harshly condemn and judge opiate users while giving users of other, far more harmful, substances a pass. In this case ""they"" might be your family, friends and loved ones and if they care about you and are able to think logically they will, maybe grudgingly or reluctantly at first, accept that there is a massive double standard that costs people their right to live as productive and valued members of society. Having more people on your side won't change the world overnight but it does make a difference coping and surviving in a world that can be extremely  hostile and prejudiced. ",1463797344.0

I've been off opiates for a while, but to deal with the cravings I would smoke marijuana. 

Well, she caught me smoking weed and that's when she gave me the ultimatum. 

Knowing I wouldn't be able to keep the cravings at bay forever, i did some research and found Tianeptine. A 100% legal substance that acts like an opiate but isn't. 

I've been using it for a few weeks now. I take 200-300mg in the morning and it's been nice. It creates an opiate buzz that lasts 2-3 hours. 

There is a potential for tolerance and withdrawals, but my main question is has anyone else considered using Tianeptine for maintenance?

So since then I've been doing pretty well, couldn't be happier to be through with that life, working hard, in a relationship, blah blah. Everything good on paper.

Until a few days ago. Now, I've definitely experienced cravings before now, but they always go away and I can take my mind off them by going to a meeting or calling my sponsor or having rough gorilla sex all day, but this shit I'm in now is stronger than all of those cravings put together and it came out of fucking nowhere.

I just want that numbness, that euphoria. I even took an extra sub today to try and stave this shit off, but it didn't help. I'd rather die than use again, so my last resort kinda thought is to maybe find something else to get a buzz off of so that I can satisfy my urge to disconnect/feel altered.

This afternoon I drove from the place I'm currently living to a big city in the region to cop. Once I got there, I was walking down the street to the corner I usually frequent when I come across another corner that's selling dope. Haven't had anything in a couple weeks so I decided to buy a bag and try it. After discreetly sniffing a bump, I made my way to my usual corner and picked up a bun. By that point the dope I bought at the first corner was kicking in and wasn't too bad, so I decided to head back over there and buy a couple more bags, cause I like having a variety to choose from. So as I was walking back over, being the slightly buzzed dumbass that I am, I decided to get out my money and start counting it so I could just pull it out once I got back to the first corner and make a smooth transaction. It was at that moment that the police cruiser pulled up beside me. ""Sir, come on over here."" I'm a soft, nervous little man-child, so I immediately began freaking the hell out on the inside. Here I am, high, with a hundred bucks worth of heroin in my pocket, being stopped by the cops. I could already see myself getting arrested and booked and charged and somehow having to explain all of this to my family and friends. They asked for my ID, and I handed it to the driver through the open window. I held my hands in the air until I was instructed to place them on the hood of the car and stay still. I began studying the hood of the cruiser. The officer in the passenger seat got out and started searching me while the pair took turns asking me questions:

Searcher: ""What are you doing here?"" I couldn't think of anything on the spot, and I was too busy trying not to shit myself, so I just kept quiet.

Driver: ""Dopefordaze, where you from?"" ""I'm from Dopetown.""

Searcher: ""Got anything on you?"" ""Yeah, I've got a knife."" ""That's this right here?"", he said, closing his fingers around the slight bulge in my pocket. ""Yeah.""

He was grabbing around on the outside of the pockets of my hoodie. The left pocket of my hoodie just so happened to contain the bundle I had just bought. His fingers brushed over the bundle and my heart sank. I'm fucked for sure, I thought.

Searcher: ""I see you got some cash on you, are you going to buy?"" Wait a second, he doesn't know I've already bought? Did he somehow miss the bundle he just patted through my jacket? ""Yeah, I'm on my way to buy.""

Driver: ""Where are you parked, Dopefordaze?"" I told him and motioned in the general direction. At this point, he handed my license back and told me to go back to my car and go home.

I walked speedily away, feeling relieved and a little shocked. How the hell had he not felt that bundle? Did he notice it but decide not to say anything? I could hardly believe my luck. Of course, next time I might not be so lucky. And I definitely won't be stupid enough to take my money out as I'm walking down the street.

tl;dr- got stopped and searched by cops who missed the bundle I had in my pocket.",1463879177.0

If someone binges on oxys twice a year, and this time they've got ahold of maybe 45 x 5mg IR tablets and have taken 10-20mg orally on 5 out of the last 9 days are they at risk of any serious (ie. can't go to work) withdrawal symptoms if this pattern of use continues for 1-2 more days?

It's not a big deal to use them separately when I'm sitting at home but when I'm at work and use in the bathroom, it takes me long enough as it is to mix one up if I haven't pre made one and to shoot it. Throw in applying two types of ointment, letting the first be fully rubbed in and dry before applying the second and it equals an irritated supervisor. 

Any insight would be appreciated :) 

P.S. for anyone else planning to try Mederma for tracks, keep an eye out for future posts by NightlyNods30...

Suboxone induction 3:30am Thursday night/Friday morning
It is now 11am Saturday morning. I guess I consider this the beginning of Day 2.

Between sub induction and this morning I have taken 7mg of sub. I don't think I really took that much though because I'll admit I'm kind of wasteful with the sublingual dosing (spitting/swallowing early; losing crumbs when I break the sub into pieces...I'm fortunate to have access to a decent amount at a good price)

I've basically had two sleeps- the 3:30am-noon Friday and 10pm Friday to 9am Saturday morning (with a 2 hour sweat/smoke break in the middle of the night lol). 

Today (saturday) I am going to a hotel for 24 hours that has a hot tub steam and sauna. I know I'm fortunate to have this option. I am going to try to minimize further sub usage until I need to go back to work Monday (and my work mon-wed will be very easy so it should help ease me back into things).

So far I've been taking: suboxone, valium, potassium supplement, multivitamin/minerals, plenty of water, protein bars and meal replacements. Oh yes, and plenty of indica (even hybrids give me anxiety these days). 

I have Friday - Sunday to make as much progress as possible and then I have Mon-Wed to ease back into the work life. I'm hoping to be off valium by monday, but I'm willing to take sub a little longer in small doses.

Oh, and I'm coming off 6-10 roxys a day. Hellish habit. I've had to travel a lot lately and I was just getting disgusted with the amount of pills I had to buy for a week away just to spend time with my family without looking like a junkie.

I have some muscle relaxers and melatonin I plan to use for days 5-8 just to help with sleep. I don't even seem to have the sweats during the day- only at night.

Just thought I'd share my progress and most importantly I'm hoping to hear from anyone else that is detoxing/wding right now for whatever reason. I know some may say this belongs more in opiates recovery, but I am still a junkie. Maybe I'll go see them in a month. ",1463855001.0

I would like to mention that it's a really bad idea, not because one will NECESSARILY go back to his old addiction (I didn't take anymore since 3 weeks), but because after a WD phase you are somewhat shellshocked and in ""I will not take that shit anymore"" phase, and taking an opiate make you get over the mini shellshock aspect then at the end you can resume your addiction more easily if you don't control yourself.",1463854876.0

Now when I got home I didn't do any right away cause I had done a little that morning and was still feeling it. My guy hits me up and warns me to only do a very little amount. I said don't worry about it I only do a little anyway. 

 When I decided to do some I looked at my gear and it looked different than the last stuff I had. This stuff was really white and had no smell of vinegar at all which good ECP usually does, so my first thought was fuck this dude G'd me. But I decided to try the littlest amount just to see.  

And wow I got a pretty nice rush from doing like tiniest bit I was really surprised.  Then I was even more surprised when I woke up like 40 minutes later on my couch covered in sweat.

This is my first time posting here and I am using a cleverly named throwaway. But I mean it. Right now anyways. I cant ever say with confidence again that I am done shooting H for good. Damn this is humbling. 

A quick backstory, I started using IV heroin as a kid, maybe 16 or 17 was my first time. I gave into it immediately and it took me straight down to my knees, me and everyone I was close to. At 21 I started to get clean by choice for 2-3-6 month periods of time but couldnt maintain. I was finally at the point where I could either choose to die alone, and probably soon, or take the offer I had received to go on Subutex during my last detox attempt. I maintained this for about 3 years and although I didn't want to be on the drug forever, I was still somewhat proud of myself. Boy that pride was stripped. About 2 weeks ago I was given an opportunity to relapse that I took immediately with no hesitation. I stopped with the subutex and started up a run that lasted about 2 weeks - about 3-4 grams of IV dope daily. The quality I cant really tell bc ive been on the subs for so long. But the stuff worked so it must have been decent.

I spent about $1500. Luckily, right now, other than my pride, it looks like I may have nipped this in the bud just in time, and hopefully cost me nothing more. Money is just money. So I did my last dose Thursday evening at 6:30 and woke up at 4 AM in cold sweats tossing and turning. I had absolutely no ability to wait it out an longer than 12 hours and at 6:30 the next day I took about 2 mgs of sub. It didnt seem to do much of anything and an hour later I took another 2. About an hour later I remember being really overwhelmed bc I had apparantly taken the sub too early, but it didnt seem like PWD. I fell asleep and woke up two hours later in agony. I have had ups and downs ever since and today decided to stop taking the sub. No matter how much i took I never felt better. I think it made me worse. I will not take any today and try not to tomorrow.

Ive seen this all over the internet but no real clear answers.

Does anyone have any advice? Yesterday I called my dealer to get some relief and after leaving the house I realized that if I went and saw him again I might never come back. I told him to block my number and that I sorry to dick him around but I had to back out. He was cool about it but it took some time to convince him that I was done. For that day anyways. 

Today I am about 18-20 hours off subs and feel better. Its been 4 days and this is freaking me out. I almost know that if i take a sub I will feel like shit again.

But the thing is, I've been depressed for 11 years while my boyfriend has only ever had irregular moments of brooding. He gets depressed but he's good at getting himself out of it.
Well, I've been fine with my drug use, he hasn't made mention of it. But I've shared with him and introduced him and now we're both experiencing our withdrawals differently because I'm already used to feeling like shit without drugs but he's reacting differently from me, it seems.
I'm worried I've dragged him down into my pit with what's been helping me not wallow completely and commit suicide. I keep telling him, ""it'll only get better"" even though I have carved into myself that that's not always true. I say it to him because I've seen him jump out and be busy and produce and achieve, but what if it won't happen this time? We've been together for 6 years and this is the most I've worried seeing him look as helpless as I feel.. 
I know we'll get through this, the withdrawals, I just hope he'll bounce back to his ability before I brought this stuff in.

To preface; I've been an on and off IV heroin/opiate user for close to 10 years now with bouts of sobriety here and there. Been to many treatments and detoxes, in and out of NA and AA, all that stuff. I always seem to get sober for a few months or even a year or two, build up a good life around myself with a girlfriend, car, job, only to pull it all down on my head by starting using again. I've repeated this pattern multiple times now. If you're wondering where I'm at in that cycle right now, to be honest I'm right at the beginning of relapse mode. Sobered up again last year, met a girl with a couple kids, got an OK job, but lately have been dabbling again and I know exactly where I'm heading. But that's my life.

Anyway. Sometime in 2014 I was using pretty heavily and discovered that immodium could at least ease withdrawal a bit and I'd even read online about people getting ""high"" on it. So I started casually using it to ease withdrawals, I started with about 10-20 pills at a time and it seemed to curb the withdrawal somewhat. The problem was that I live in a pretty rural area and most of my dope was extremely expensive (average $300 a G for some just okay tar). (Also, suboxone and methadone are simply not available in my region, the closest subs doctor is at least an 8 hour drive.) I was getting a lot of my dope from DNM's too, but the point being that I never had a really good actual steady hookup that I could afford reqularly. This meant that I would use in big binges, never being able to score 10 bags or really anything less than half a gram at a time which IRL cost 150-200 bucks or on the DNM's which meant a lot of waiting around. So by this point I'm using immodium quite regularly to stave off withdrawal.

Fast forward to early 2015, I'm still bingeing but at this point it has taken a LOT more immodium to ease withdrawals and I'm using it very regularly and even getting buzzed off of it sometimes. Well it got to the point that all my sources were dried up and i had been using immodium for so long that I actually started NEEDING it in the same way that I needed H. Let me tell you, immodium withdrawals are not fun. I'd compare it to methadone withdrawal just in the way that it's so long and drawn out. I ended up in detox for a week due to an involuntary committal put on me by a family member who found out I was shooting up. Then I went to treatment for 28 days. It took basically all those 5 weeks to finally be completely well again. I think I counted over 70 hours of not sleeping my first few days in detox. 

If your wondering how much immodium I was taking, I was taking at least a bottle of 72 per day just to not be sick, even when I hadn't used actual opiates in weeks. It became my version of methadone or suboxone. Fast forward to today, I chip H and whatever other opiates I can get and still use immodium to help with withdrawals when they get bad but I really hate the shit. I'm sure most of you will chalk me up as another dumbfuck who is part of the problem, and who is ruining it for everyone. ",1463965476.0

So anyway I was just shooting some coke and railing a few mg of subs before I went to this show and I did start missing my second shot, the area in the picture, but only a bit because I registered fine but was using my left hand and I'm a right handed person. I moved it up a bit then back down during the short time I was pushing the plunger down. New needle, disinfected with 78 % isopropyl alcohol and the held a shirt over it for a minute.

When came down and looked the area had only a small bump. I figured even tho it barely hurt I should still put a compress on. I ran some hot water and put it on right aftet. The small pain subsided right after but then when I pulled it off the bump had expanded to the size it is in the pick. Also a wide area around the shot got much more red than it was before the compress. I used a paper towel that was fresh and new from the package. 

Do you think I somehow got something in my arm or it's infected? Or should I just chill out and keep the warm compress on? Harm reduction is the most valuable asset this sub has, and since I do dope and subs I feel a lot of kinship with you guys and I really hope you can help. Sorry for the novel but I wanted you to know i used all fresh and new supplies except the spoon which had a couple small flecks of tobacco on it from my cig pack but there was none in the syringe when I filtered the shot into it.

In fact I'll smoke 3x what my friends do and while they're nodding off on the couch i'll be pacing around. It's almost like opioids give me energy now. No matter how much I use I can't get a ""high"" or even tired for that matter, yet if I don't use I feel like absolute shit mentally. I don't ever get dopesick anymore because of my methadone yet I still mentally crave fentanyl and heroin more than anything and I feel like complete shit mentally when I don't have any. Has anyone else experienced this? I feel like by IV'ing I'll be getting a lot more to the brain a lot quicker and at once so I may get that nod and maybe even a bit of euphoria. I use heroin more than anything as I hear lots of horror storys of people using fent so much chasing a non existant high and ODing, being resuscitated, then saying they weren't even high when they OD'd. I just want to nod again if I can't feel euphoric so be it, I just don't understand why it seems that heroin and fentanyl seem to give me energy rather than doing what it does to all my fellow junkys I use with. 

TL;DR
I take 100mgs of methadone a day and don't get a nod or euphoric high no matter how much heroin/fentanyl I smoke. Will IV'ing make the difference or am I setting myself up for failure? (I've been a failure since I've been using opioids, I mean am I going to nod or feel any euphoria or will I still be pacing around, jealous of my sleeping friends who aren't on methadone)",1463948694.0

After being antsy all day yesterday, I finally found a hookup. None of my connects were answering, even worse actually one dude did answer (my boy who is usually a solid H connect) and then stopped answering once he was ""on his way"". Anyway, found a connect, ran over there, picked up 6 oxy 30s. They looked a bit suspicious, and this guy had been known to get worthless pills before. So I eat one (I'm usually a snorter) and as soon as it hits my tongue it begins to dissolve IMMEDIATELY, leaving a baby powder taste in my mouth. SHIT. Call dude back, no answer, call back ANSWERED!
Me: Bro these are fake as fuck man.
Dboy: Ah man you sure.
Me: Yeah man, I've had all kinds of these things man. These things are straight up baby powder or some shit.
Dboy: Ight come on back, I'll make it right. I just got 'em from this boy on the corner. Let me get 'em back.

I drive back, thinking he's gonna not come out. Or he's gonna come out with a gun or some shit. But dude is worth his salt. He gives me ALL of my money back (was assuming he'd just give me the money for the ones I had left). Says he's gonna run back to the dude he got them from. He goes back, calls me says he's got no other opiates besides Methadone 10mg for $5 a pill. Now, I've only done the 'done once a few years back when I was in a similar situation. I enjoyed the all day pseudo-high, steady analgesia but I love the rush of oxys. But at this point I have no choice. I get 5. Took one at 11 PM. It effected me exactly as I remembered. Decide I'll keep the others for situations like this I may be in in the future. 

Next morning (today): Feeling fine, do what I need to do, starting to feel the effects subsiding around 11 AM. Pop another 'done. This is 12 hours after my first dose. It kicked in and I'm feeling it again (written at 14:45). NOW my most stable connect hits me up, he's good. Go cop some oxys. The joy is back in my life!

Aaaaaanyway, my question is this: How long after my last 10 mg of Methadone should I wait until I take my first 30 mg of Oxy? Do I need to wait at all? Does Methadone have the ""blocking"" effects of Suboxone or the like?

Tolerance: when the money is good and the dboys are answering I have no issues snorting five 30s a day, spread out with 30-45mg per dose.

TL;DR: How long after a 10mg dose of Methadone should I wait to make the most of my first 30mg Oxy?",1463943318.0

I've posted here for awhile under different names, so I know this community pretty well. Recently, I decided to check out other subs. Some subs like to cross post discussions from other subs, archive it, and have circle jerks about their own superiority over those they ridicule. They target anyone who they deem inferior: sex workers, the GLBTQ community, and drug users, among others. Furthermore, most of the redditors who frequent these subs are bigots or radicals of one stripe or another. 


Many of them openly express racist and homophobic attitudes, and some of them openly identify with extreme right wing political ideologies such as white nationalism. Some of them express beliefs like race is a biological category, not a subjective sociological construct and the innate superiority of one race over another, just to name a few. Obviously, these people are pretty fucking behind the curve when it comes to living in the 21st century. 

But they're watching and I'm sure they're willing to hurt you if they can. So, be very careful about the personal information you share here. While most people who post here are sympathic to one another, these people certainly are not. In conclusion, whenever you post, always bear in mind that some self-righteous, anti-social neo-nazi from the shallow end of the gene pool could be reading your all of your posts.",1463935940.0
4kugf9,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/4kugf9/anyone_else_stuck_in_this_shitty_cycle/,37,https://redd.it/4kugf9,Diflubrotrimazolam,Anyone else stuck in this shitty cycle?,"So instead of coming on and proclaiming myself a card carrying chipper who has more self control than all you and am special and blah blah, let me give you another perspective that might explain the chippers and the stupid sounding posts they make sometimes that are just met with warnings and offense.

So I call myself a chipper simply because I don't use every day. But why don't I use everyday? Is it cuz I have this amazing self control and am special like that? Fuck no. Here's more what my dilemma looks like 

1) After being through a couple, I am a pussy who is literally too batshit scared of bad withdrawal to use daily. The fear is what keeps my habit minimal. Once I snort some ECP I have the compulsion to just keep doing more and more like the average addict, but instead I think forward to withdrawals, and I sadly tell myself I've had enough for the day. 

2) At the same time, I'm not scared *enough* of withdrawal (and like the high too much) to quit all together, to take a long break to actually start from ""clean"", or to space out my doses properly all the time.

So where does this leave me? Around January this year my parents came up for a long (2 week) visit. As I didn't want to show any signs of sickness or anything, for the first time in forever I did bump every 12 hrs, to always feel/appear well. 

Well needless to say that was enough, after chipping for a while, to give me a week of moderate withdrawal. However, once I was at about day 3 clean once my parents left, I used again. 

Since then, I've been trying to use once every 3 days, but the problem is I feel like I never let myself finish withdrawal from that 2 week regular use. So this 3 day thing that was working pretty well before now feels totally fucked. Using one day will give me withdrawals for 2 days. Sometimes now I can't wait and use after 48 hrs clean.

I almost feel like this is worse than a daily habit, because at least then I'd have nice long portions of time where I'm free of wd. But then I think about the much more severe wd that would come at the end of that use and decide ""no thanks"". But what's the alternative? I'm basically in minor withdrawal 4-5 out of every 7 days. 

I don't have the willpower to finish out a nice stretch of clean time, but I don't have the guts to use every day, with fear of bad wd.

So this isn't a chipper proudly proclaiming he's got a system down and uses so smartly he is so damn special. This is a chipper who feels like a pathetic idiot caught in a terrible cycle of feeling great every once in a while, and feeling shitty the rest. 

Anyone else ""trying"" to quit (as in making an effort not to use every day) but then keep using once after 2-4 days clean, wash rinse repeat FML? 

Basically one (one!) use in my ""purgatory"" state throws me into withdrawal for a day or two. One withdrawal for every high. Isn't that the stupidest shit you've ever heard? 

I've got a 2 week trip to the east coast (to visit family) coming up where I have no connects, so I'm hoping that forced abstinence will at least help me out a bit, cuz this cycle really is shit.

~~~~

UPDATE: Well it's the night before I finally go home, and unfortunately, basically no cleaner than before. I had a guy screw me over (basically stole half my ecp) the day before we travelled, so that night I was so pissed at myself for letting that happen that I just snorted myself stupid. I won't lie, it felt great and cathartic, but I haven't nodded in forever, and it was pretty bad. I remember sitting there in front of my laptop around midnight while my wife slaps me awake over and over again to finish making the stupid car rental reservation and flight check in. Took me forever lol... anyway I woke up on travel day sick as a dog. First time ever I tried to start a clean morning with kratom and ended up puking it right back up. Puked 4 more times while having to pack before heading to airport. I gave up and did a small bit of ecp before heading out, and stashed my only 6 blues (fucker was supposed to give me 20 a week ago and never did) in my kpin script bottle. 12 day trip, ended up splitting my blues in half and taking 15mg a day around noon just to kinda feel okay for the better part of most days. It worked, other than mornings sucking major ass. If only I hadn't had that douchebag fuck me over like that I wouldn't have used the night before travel, wouldn't have taken anything with me, and would be 15 days clean right now. Got one more half blue for the flight tomorrow, can't wait to get back and try to clean this mess up with kratom... Fuck. ",1464105341.0

Will just stay clean until I test Saturday.

I've been prescribed subs for about a year, and in that time I've switched back and forth between maintenance and active using.  My D.O.C. is IV heroin, and I've been on a bender for the past three weeks, with my tolerance really sky-rocketing this time.  This is why I'm so anxious!  I've never tried switching to suboxone from such a large amount of daily dope use.  

I'm going to try the technique where I take my dose of subs in the morning, expecting precipitated withdrawal.  Then I will take the last of my stash, (about 3 tenths of a gram) as soon as I start feeling really sick.  And I will definitely feel very very sick since my last hit of H will only be about 12 hours before taking the subs.  I just don't have the patience or mental fortitude to wait the 24-36 hours to be in enough real withdrawal to take the subs.  Even if I did, I'm not confident I would be in the clear and escape precipitated withdrawal because 8mg of suboxone will only cover someone with a pretty low tolerance.

So, tomorrow morning I will try my method and post a comment about what my experience is like.  After I take that shot that comes after the suboxone dose I anticipate feeling sick again about 8 to 10 hours later, maybe less.  At this point I will try subs again and see what happens.  If I get thrown into precipitated withdrawals again I guess I will pick up more gear and try again the next day.  The theory here is that getting on a schedule where you're taking subs and heroin concurrently, eventually I should reach a point where it no longer sends me into precipitated withdrawal and I can continue with just the subs and feel good.  This has worked for me before but like I said, big tolerance so not sure how it's going to go.

Any advice, comments, etc. would be greatly appreciated :)  I can also offer advice to anyone who's going through something similar as I'm fairly experienced with this absurd game",1464068139.0

So, I'm a 20-something year old guy. Last year I began experiencing.episodes of Torsades-de-points caused by MASSIVE mega-dosing loperamide. I'd just moved across country to get away from dope, and I needed some relief to get me through the horrific withdrawal to come. I had 2 subodone that lasted me 8 days. After that, nothing. I gave lope a try, but considering the last time I'd tried it to help with w/ds and it did nothing, I was skeptical. I decided this time I was gonna go big. I discovered that at Costco you can get a box of 2 lope bottles 200 2 mg pills a piece for 5 bucks. What?? That first few days, I took about 100 mg a day. I barely felt any symptoms at all. In fact, I got through my w/D's with no problem. But now I was mega-dosing lope. After 6 months of that, my heart said, ""fuck this shit, I'm out."" Turns out I had a SEVERE case of long QT Syndrome. I went into cardiac arrest in the hospital twice, and a day later I had an ICD (implantable cardioverter defibrillator, a defib and pacemaker.) If this device failed, I'd die. Keep in mind, my entire hospital stay I was in full, severe w/D's from lope. I got fentanyl in surgery, and after having to stop the surgery and resume the next day, I got propofol (full anesthetic, killed Michael Jackson."" I asked the anesthesiologist if we we're about to start, and he says ""we're already done."" Lol. I was high as balls.
So, next day I'm back in full withdrawal after my many fentanyl doses during the first attempt at the surgery.
The Universe shown upon me this day, as I found a sub doctor who would induce me while I was still in the hospital. The next day I'm our with a sub script and some ativan.

Fast-Forward.
I found a psychiatrist in my area who prescribes suboxone. Had my charts sent over from my previous sub doctor.
So far I've  gotten:
90 8 mg Subs a mo
120 1 mg clonazepam
30 1 mg alprazolam
60 100 mg sertraline.

I'm an addict in ""recovery"" as in I haven't used any dope since I moved over 2 years ago. BUT, between my subs, a boatload of benzos, and hydroponic marijuana I'm feeling GOOD AS FUCK every day.

Is it possible I just got bad shit?,"One possible factor is that I take Kratom multiple times a day, so maybe that's interfering. But I was under the impression that Kratom alkaloids were weak and heroin is... well, heroin is the King. So I'm a bit surprised that it wouldn't blast through any tolerance I may have built up.

The other possibility is that it was just bad shit. I had never tried heroin before I bought this stuff so I didn't really know what to expect. I connected with the dealer online and he had a good reputation from other customers based on reviews I read. Also his delivery guy had me snort some in front of him so he could make sure I was legit, and I figure they want repeat business so I don't see why they would sell me bunk shit.

I guess the last possibility is that I didn't snort enough.

Am I just expecting too much from snorting heroin? All it did was make me feel a little spaced out and tired/sleepy, maybe a little relaxed, but it was far from addictive. If this is the ""big scary drug""... I'm just surprised by how relatively mild it is.

P.S. Please refrain from comments like ""bang that shit."" I know that would feel really good but I have no intention of using needles... at least not at this stage of my life. Maybe in another decade or so...

I haven't had a serious habit in a long, long time, but kept fucking around and violating parole so I decided to give Vivitrol a try. The first injection I got I recall I was pretty much clean. Initially there is no noticeable change. I end up taking a week off work though and feel just... mundane. I remember a total loss of sex drive as well, and I didn't want to work out. I just wanted to sit around and watch tv.

Anyways I tried getting high at the end of the month, then the clinic wouldn't let me get it again. Continued chipping but didn't really catch a habit. 

Cut to recently due to work I pretty much had to get the shot again. I was not using very much and totally stopped for like a week prior, except I shot an 8mg suboxone 3 days prior to the vivitrol. 

This injection was much worse. The first 2 days I had crazy mood swings, treated my family like shit, girlfriend like shit. Made a fool of myself honestly and I'm ashamed. The thing is... it wasn't precipitated withdrawal. I felt fine the entire first day I had the shot. 

During these horrible 2 days I didn't have any problems sleeping, any body pains, or other tell tale signs of dope sicknesses. My girlfriend insists it's the suboxone I did. The thing is I don't believe my body was dependent on it for the vivitrol to wipe it out. Plus you can get high on subs while on the vivitrol shot (to an extent).

I'm trying to really push that I DONT think it is my bodies craving for opiates causing my current depression. Like I said I wasn't strung out before, I was on parole so I had to drop every week. 

I've read some things about people saying vivitrol blocks natural dopamine release, like from exercise. I can't comment on this because for about the first week or two I had no desire to work out (despite drug use I still try to stay fit, prison habits) but I did still enjoy smoking weed and going to the gym a few weeks into the shot. The side effects did get better last time. 

Depression is a side effect listed for vivitrol but it seems like every fucking med has depression as a potential side effect. This time around I'm noticing 2 other listed side effects: tiredness and nausea. Not only do I not have any motivation from depression I feel physically very tired. I have Hep C but the last test I had done said it had not done any harm yet and my liver was very healthy. 

I think I've struggled with minor depression before in my life but this feels more serious. It's worth noting I should be very happy right now as opposed to pre vivitrol because:
A) Have my own car again
B) Have my first house
C) Got off parole, been on paper all together for 7 years
D) Got off work due to side effects of shot
E) Great weather, new neighborhood


Jesus this became a wall of text. Here's a TLDR:
1. Vivitrol is not the miracle they promote it as. It reminds me of back when suboxone first came out and the doctors told me you ""couldn't be addicted to it"" and ""couldn't get high off it"". 

2. Anyone else want to share their experience? Am I one of the few? Because I don't hear much bad about it on here. 

PS. I didn't post this in recovery because I am not looking to recover. I don't want to do heroin anymore, but if this is what I have to go through I'd rather just get back on suboxone.",1464055972.0

He says they told him they were gonna drug test him on his upcoming appointment, what does that mean for him? He does not do any other drugs other than those painkillers, but I do know they can perform an in depth test seeing what type of opiates are in his system. If oxy is in the results and he is not prescribed, what will happen to him?
 

UPDATE 6-2-2016: My roommate ended up taking the piss test, in the time between the results, he managed to rack up six ""strikes"" under his name at the PM clinic. These included lying to the doctor saying he lost his script in his hotel room (they gave him a refill), going to the pharm trying to fill his script even though he didn't have one, totally missing an appt. w/ doc (no call, no show), and then 30 minutes late to his next (and two more unrelated events). After all those, his doc. said policy said they should drop him, but kept him on and said ""don't fuck up again"". Well today they called and said they saw oxy in his system from the lab results and completely dropped him. I just ordered 6 oz. of Kratom to help him while he still will take his oxys. He is spending $500 a week on Oxy.

Doc gave him 6 months worth of script Tramadol though. Hoping he pulls out of this. I love him like a brother and don't understand his addiction to opiates, but hopefully Kratom will pull him out of the hole he is in.

Without going into too much detail someone close to me now has 3 years to press charges against me and plans to do so if I do not 'stay clean.'

If they did press charges it would pretty well be an open and shut case and I'd be looking at around 3 to 5 years. I also very rarely even see this person. I had always planned to pay the person back anyway, but unfortunately I got caught up before I had I chance to tell them what I had done and give them the money. And everyone knows that as bad as something is, it's always 10x worse if they find out from someone else instead of you coming clean to them. They just found out alot sooner than I had anticipated. 

So, flash forward to them finding out. I sat down with them and I said I want to start by expressing how truely sorry I am to which they shocked me by saying ""let's start this way instead, my name is ______ and I'm an addict"" I was like holy shit, never would have thought. So, we're talking and carrying on, they're sharing advice and all that and I also hand them every dime I owe them to pay them back. 

Then as we're getting close to the end of this sit down, I'm thinking alright, I paid them back.. they understand the disease, ok, everything is cool... or as cool as it can be given the circumstances. WRONG. Then they lay it on me that they feel they are enabling me by not pressing charges and informs me the statute of limitations is 3 years for what I had done. They then start with the need for me to get into a 12 step and that if I ""fail"" at getting clean that they will have me locked up. What exactly is fail? Full blown relapse, one time slip up, what constitutes failure? He failed to go into detail there. 

I said to him very calmly and diplomatically, ""I DO indeed want to get clean and very soon, but I'm not 100% sure if I'm ready or not yet... and also everything I've read about recovery says that forcing someone to quit via threats of jail time and other negative consequences is one of the worst things you can do to someone that needs to get clean."" He replied that that wasn't true and quite the opposite and that my only chance of staying out of jail is to quit immediately, get into a 12 step, and getting close to God... he knows I'm not a believer. I have no issues with people who are believers but it's just not for me... he said if I 'fail' his hands would be tied and he feels he would have to force me to hit rock bottom. He knows if I went to prison I would lose my good paying job, lose my girlfriend (who is currently pregnant with our 2nd child.... meaning he would be fucking her over also) and lose all rights to visitation of my daughter...

After hearing all of this I'm kinda calling bullshit on him being a recovering addict. He is someone that has a serious complex and is happiest when trying to run someone else's life, since his is such shit. Married to a mail order SE Asia bride, lives on disability, and is generally fairly depressed. He's on more benzos and psychotropic meds than I can count. 

I am having trouble figuring out if he is truely trying to help me and is just ignorant to the proper way to go about it, OR of this is just more of the same of his need to have control over the people around him.... 

And now that he has been paid back and thinks I'm staying clean, he has basically started holding my freedom hostage. I was recently told I'm going to have to help him pack of his vacation home and u haul everything to his house as a form of community service work HA! he KNOWS I work 48+ hrs a week and have to do REAL community service work for an unrelated driving on revoked charge on my days off. 

I just kind of feel like, I paid him back and if I'm not ready yet, I'm not ready yet and he needs to back off a little, especially if he truely is recoverying.... he should just know better =/ 

Idk I'm kinda noddin and having trouble staying on point here.

So as I asked in the title... is there anything worse than someone just trying to 'help' and doing the addict a big disservice..? Not to mention the fact that of I did go to prison I'd basically be in the dope candy store depending where I got shipped too...

TL;DR: I fucked up but I made things right and now I'm being held under this persons thumb for 3 years =/

Well I'd moved away to get away from all the dope (didn't work) there, and a few months later decided to make a trip back to that city to score and get some of my things I'd left. I drive by my dudes house and see some random people I'd never seen there before sitting outside so I figure he moved or didn't live there anymore. Decided to cold cop, so I went down to the McDonalds where I know everyone scores at and the first dude I asked said he was able to help me out. We go over to some buddys of his standing on the side of the McD's, do the transaction. Then I think, fuck I need a rig. I hop on down a couple blocks to the grocery store and hit up the pharmacy.

Here's where it gets interesting. As I'm leaving the parking lot a cop passes me on his way into the parking lot. I don't think much of it since I know it's a high drug area, but then he makes a U-turn and gets behind me. At this point I've got dope and a pack of rigs on me. I try to drive casually through some neighborhoods but only make it a couple blocks from the grocery store and before I know it I'm pulled over and immediately have 2 guns drawn on me as I'm told to walk backwards slowly. They immediately asked ""Where's the dope?!"" They find my dope, but not only that they find a few dozen shotgun shells in my trunk. Suddenly I'm being questioned about a murder that had happened a couple days earlier and then finally after a LOT of convincing from my end they realize that I'm just a white kid who likes to shoot guns. 

So we get headed back to the station and on our way to the station they decide they want to bust a couple dudes they see openly selling.... at McD's.... Fuck... now I'm thinking these dudes are gonna think I ratted on them or some shit and I'm either gonna get my ass kicked in jail or worse. So I'm freakin the fuck out in the backseat cuffed at this point and the cops have the dude I just scored from pinned against the hood being searched. They find his dope or whatever and throw him in the backseat with me. I try to look away and not show my face but it's inevitable, he instantly recognizes me. Then he says ""what up homie looks like we're gonna be gettin to know each other a little better haha!"" I'm flooded with relief knowing that I'm not gonna have my ass handed to me in a fucking county jail and treated like a snitch.

So anyways, we get to the station and right there in the car the cop takes my dope and does a field test on it, tells me its positive for dope.  After a few more questions (mostly related to the murder the few days before), the cop lets dude go but I get thrown in county for 5 days. Thank god I wasn't dopesick.

Well I get out of county and my junky brain immediately decides to go back to the same spot and try this whole god damn thing over again. I get to McD's and there he is again. Me and him get to talking and eventually are laughing about the whole situation. We then proceed to go smoke a bunch of crack and shoot dope for 3 days and become good friends after that. I end up going back home and months (now years) later I still have no charges from that incident.

----------------------------------------------------
QUESTION for you guys - Do you think the pharmacist called the cops on me? This is literally the only fucking thing I can think of as to why the cops pulled me over. The fuckers knew I had dope on me somehow. Plus I was never charged so my guess is that I was pulled over illegally by them, they knew I was pulled over illegally so therefore never charged me. Also, the pharmacist acted very weird when I asked her for the rigs and she really weirded me out when I got them.",1464188301.0

I am a former user of anonimous imgboards, 55chan (u could call it the brazilian 4chan) and I always heard from reddit but today was the fist time I came in and tried to figure it out how this works, so please sorry if I am misusing the board or about my english.


I am 25 and I suffer from sickle cell disease, it turns your red blood cells into crushed glass (this is the best description I can give without writing a huge text but you can read more about it here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sickle-cell_disease). So since I was a kid, I am used to hit the ER crying like a baby and twisting my aching arm or leg in pain. 10mg Morphine IV and fluids until the pain gets controlled. This is how it works since I was a kid. I lived in Dublin for 8 months, got admitted in a hospital for 6 days and they pump a lot of morphine inside the patients, so around the world the treatment is the same.

When I am at home, I use RX drugs like codeine, oxycodone, tramadol (I just quit tramal after having a seizure due to an OD) and I use it almost everyday due to the middle pain that I have normally (I have femur head necrosis and this sucks a lot, happened because of the SCD). So I am totally hooked by opiates and I make some kind of rotation with each kind so I can keep my tolerance down (cross tolerance stuff and opiates management, I do this by my own, my doctor doesn't really care about tolerance hitting the ceiling, just raise the oxy dosage). So here goes my question: Can I drop opiates for anything else? Is there any known drug that doesn't get you high and doesn't hook you like opiates do? I know there is no studies showing evidences on opiates toxicity but I am depressive so I often abuse the stuff like a couple months ago I was rolling transderm fentanyl under my tongue and tripping balls from it. My tolerance is huge, which makes it easier to OD from it; and I don't like to be high all the time. I used almost everything you can imagine, I like to get high but to live under the influence 24/7 sucks. Antiinflamatory works great for me but it screws with your kidneys so it is a NO.

I thought i'd make a post about the importance of oxygen in an OD situation and talk about how you can recognise the early warning signs of an OD. I'm originally from from Australia where I used to teach overdose response pre-narcan availability. I also used to work at the Sydney MSIC (a SIF) where I treated literally hundreds of overdoses and prior to that I used to run a drop in center and outreach program where we'd deal with overdoses on a regular basis without Narcan.

Some ODs happen instantly but others happen slowly over a period of time. These are often the ones that can be prevented with a few simple tricks. As most of you all know, opiates slow a person's breathing down. An OD is when this breathing slows to the point that the body isn't getting enough oxygen. This doesn't necessarily mean that they will fall out, but it means that parts of the body aren't getting enough oxygen. The body starts to respond to this by cutting supply to extremities, hence the blue lips/hands etc. From a medical perspective, someone whose oxygen has dropped below what's considered an acceptable level (95%) is technically an overdose. This doen't mean they're unconcious but it can mean that the oxygen could continue to plummet to the point that they do become unconcious. 

How can you tell this is happening?

Count breaths: Everyone is different but if someone is taking less than 10 breaths per min, they may be at risk. 

Are they good breaths?: The deeper and more consistant, the better. 

Is the person confused?: When people have low oxygen, they can appear confused. They might be talking but not making much sense.

What can you do?

Posture: Get them to sit up straight. Slumping over in a deep nod is not conducive to getting enough oxygen in and can cause it to drop to a point where they'll need Narcan. This alone can make all the difference.

Get them to take deep breaths with you: Talk them through it (in, out, repeat). Sometimes this is all it takes to get someone's oxygen back up.

Administer ""verbal"" narcan: the threat of administering narcan is often enough to get someone to wake up and start breathing properly. I'm sure you all know why.

Keep an eye on them:  This is super important. If you know someone has used then make sure to keep an eye on their breathing and the color of their skin. Letting someone nod/sleep can be risky. 

If you do have to call 911 and administer narcan: Make sure you give rescue breaths while you're waiting for the Narcan to kick in. I can't stress this enough. I've seen Narcan take 15 minutes to work. Giving rescue breaths keeps oxygen going into the body. This helps prevent potential brain damage. 

I hope some of you find this helpful. Please hit me up if you have any questions!

I had gotten good product before but it's been like a year since I got anything. 
Well I met up with him today,  and first red flag,  it wasn't actually him.  It was supposedly his friend/brother,  and I had not been told I'd be meeting with anyone different. 

Anyways,  I look at my stuff and there's some powder, some pebbles, it's pretty damn white. Not the grey or brown that I've been hearing about, and am used to.

Red flag number 2, I go to mix it with some water and it doesn't really dissolve,  I just get murky white water,  with sediment left at the bottom. 

So I taste it and it's not really bitter at all, I snort a little bit and I'm not even sure if I felt anything, I may have felt something,  or it may very well be placebo. 

So anyways, I'm here with this murky white shot and I really don't want to shoot it if it's fake, like some baking soda or shit.   

So red flag number 3, I call and text dude a couple times just trying to get some reassurance that it's real. I wouldn't even be mad, just don't wanna fuck myself up shooting baking soda or something. 

So.....do you think this could be real or what?  And should I shoot some?  If it is baking soda will it hurt me? Please someone give me some answers.",1464110778.0

4kungp,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/4kungp/withdrawal_symptoms/,19,https://redd.it/4kungp,opiateboy32,Withdrawal symptoms?,"Hey guys, I don't usually use opiates (before recently I had only used vicodin when my wisdom teeth were removed), but my buddy happened to have a shit load of Opana ER so we did that for about 2 weeks. For the first 6 days or so I did 5-15mg a day and then I took a one day break and did 5-10mg a day for the next 6 or so days, with one day off in the middle. The last Opana I took was on Saturday. On Sunday, as the day went on I started to feel worse. Around 6pm or so I had some nausea and felt depressed. Yesterday I had a headache, a bit of nausea, diarrhea, lack of appetite and a bit of a fever. Today I woke up feeling a little under the weather but not too bad.

I always hear how opiate withdrawals are terrible, which leads me to believe that I'm only suffering very minor withdrawal symptoms. I also don't feel any desire to do more opiates (I have 3 Opana still but I'm saving them for the next time I see my friend, almost 0 desire to take any beforehand) which makes me think the actual addiction hasn't set in yet.

Do you guys think my symptoms are from opiate withdrawal or should I go see a doctor? I don't feel sick, I get sick fairly often and this doesn't feel like it. No significant congestion to speak of, no sinus problems, no chest pains, etc. just a bit of nausea, general feelings of discontent (which I keep reminding myself is only because of the physical ailments, I'm usually pretty upbeat) and the other symptoms I mentioned.

If this is opiate withdrawal, how long can I expect it to last?",1464107613.0

I had just finished getting clean a little more than a month ago before starting up again. 

This time I bough straight heroin in order to save money (philadelphia native). Over the past month I had worked my habit up to about 5 bags or more a day. Fed up and nearly out of money, I decided to stop the cycle.

I am dealing with the aches and hot/cold sweats as best as possible, but the real issue is a quite sharp pain in my left side below my heart. I thought it was a heart problem initially as it manifested after getting a rapid heartbeat from smoking a bit of marijuana a few hours before my last dose. However, I am now nearly 34 hours since my last dose and the pain isn't really subsiding. I am starting to think it is a stomach ulcer that bursted due to recently passing a very dark stool about an hour ago.

I am starting to think there is more to this pain than simply detoxing because the pain definitely outdoes my other symptoms. I am starting to worry that i may get hurt if this goes unaddressed. Should I call someone to take me to a doctor or does this sound normal to anyone else?

Everyone is here to contribute to the dialogue, offer support and advice as long as you're welcoming. I want this thread to help people find out their causes of loneliness, and then others may suggest coping skills or people like me or all the other wonderful uses will talk to you about the loneliness and such or just give you a /hug\  :)

**The 1st paragraph is for you to identify your cause of loneliness - the 2nd is to explain your recovery skills**

*You don't have to respond to both. One is fine. Zero is fine as well if you just want to read the comments and maybe contribute to a conversation.*

*""Here are the two questions you can answer:**

We know why we have the loneliness. I know the addicts on this subreddit have self-awareness. It definitely stems from our drug use. It could stem from being introverted and far from social. Sure we might have ""friends"" but we know, 99.9% of the time they're just a ""drug friend"" and we know it.

======> Do you guys experience any specific issues that cause loneliness? <========

Let's talk about recovery for loneliness and fighting the factors that prohibit us from developing authentic relationships that non-users tend to enjoy. How do we recover? What coping skills should we use to get rid of the loneliness?

FUCKING Gabapentin ... what the fuck is this shit. That's what I get?! Made me wait an hour, because other people were late, so I get punished for being on time. Then another hour of pretty much a sobriety test (walk a straight line, follow my finger, etc) ... WTF !!!

Ugh, my path to a script isn't going great. For the past, oh year or so, maybe more I've gone from PCP > Endocrinologists > PM specialist  and now I'm at the Neurologists stage. All my tests (CT, MRI, Blood, Thyroid, X-ray) come back good/clean. All I do is say ... ""the lower back pain is terrible, but I find it hurts more in this area. the pain is bad. the pain is not random. it's a constant pain with random spasms and shooting pain. It affects my posture, ability to sleep and lead a normal life."" That's my story and I stick to it each time. I never mention anything or ask about pain meds like ""I heard opana works well""... Damn these hoops are getting smaller and harder to jump through.

I'm with Sharp. Should I jump ship? Tell them to ""fuck off"" and go seek a family/private practice with a doc that gives no shits?

AND ... nothing good in the mail today. FUCK!

Wanted to share my story of trying to quit opiates by using Suboxone. For several years now I've taken pain pills, roughly 150mg oxy a day at minimum, some days over 200mg. When I couldn't find those I'd fill the holes with suboxone, never trying to quit just keeping normal until I could get subs again. 

On May 9th I got 2 sub strips and decided this time I'd try to quit. Of course I didn't do my research, so I decided to just take 6mg for four days straight and call it quits after that. I figured it'd get me through the worst of WD. May 12th I took my last dose of sub and felt GREAT. For a week. 

On day 6 after taking my last sub I started feeling bad, and it only got worse from there. So I suffered for two days and then got some percs with the intention of taking the edge off where necessary. Didn't work, I took them all that day, a Friday. I should've known I would. 

Saturday I felt awful, but Sunday I managed to find somebody who had some Lyrica I could use, which I've read does wonders for opiate WD, as long as it's taken short term since it can be physically addictive on its own. I started with 300mg, the lowest first dose I found recommended online, and I felt really dizzy and loopy all day Sunday. But I didn't hurt. I took 150mg Sunday evening, about 12 hours after the first dose, and slept great. 

Monday I felt OK, but by around 2PM my legs started aching really badly, so that night I took 300mg(tolerance to this stuff really ramps up quick!) of Lyrica to sleep, and it worked well. Bedtime Lyrica was the only thing I took Monday. 

Tuesday I felt great, with my legs not hurting until around 5PM, and then maybe 1/4 as bad as on Monday. Had a great appetite and in a good mood, it was nice. I took 300mg Lyrica again at bedtime Tuesday night, but barely slept due to RLS. A very mild case, but just enough that I only got about 3-4 hours sleep even with the Lyrica. 

That brings us up to today. I've taken nothing today, it's 6PM and my legs are just starting to hurt a tiny bit. I'm gonna try to tough it out this time, though, and not take anything unless it's Tylenol or Advil. As far as other symptoms, I've had very mild diarrhea since Monday (which has improved some in the meantime), no cold chills or hot sweats since Sunday, very few tingling sensations since Sunday (and almost none today), and minimal yawning since Monday. I never get stomach cramps or nausea when withdrawing, fortunately. My eyes and nose have been dry, not a lot of sneezing. My head's in good shape, don't feel really depressed or lethargic, I actually want to get up in the morning for a change. All in all, not bad for day 13 off Subs and day 5 after my percs. If I keep improving at this rate, or at least don't go backwards, then I think I might actually make it this time and stay clean. I've done it before for a year then got back into it, but I'm trying again. I know I'll still have bad days and not everyday will be as good as today has been, but I'm doing so much better than any other time I've tried to quit that I just can't help feeling proud of myself right now. 

I've written all this for two reasons. First because it helps me to get it out there and tell somebody what I'm doing and how I feel. Second because I hope that my story will help encourage others in hard times. If I could jump off at 6mg (granted for only 4 days) and feel this good in 2 weeks, I can only imagine how successful a correctly done taper can be. 

BTW, little bit of math. Assuming a 37 hour half-life, if I figured this right, I'm at .05mg suboxone still in my body. At a 72 hour half-life I'm sitting right at 1mg. I'm thinking my body is probably closer to the 37 hour half-life since on the 18th (when I started feeling bad) I was at ~1mg but at 72 hour half-life I would've been at ~5mg. I shouldn't have started feeling bad that quick, although if I'm wrong I welcome corrections.

TL;DR
I'm at day 13 after jumping off a 4 day, 6mg a day suboxone ""detox"" for a 150mg oxy a day habit, at minimum. No taper. I've been feeling great for the last 3 days with very little chemical assistance (only for help sleeping) and only seem to be getting better. So if you're trying to quit I hope this helps you, gives you a little hope. I know it's given me hope.",1464214588.0

 My current ringing on 40mg of crack(and100mg h) injected is not painful but prominent and comes with light mood lift, light euphoria and energy.

I keep hearing that if your ears start to ring on iv Cocaine that is indicative of an OD, at a low dosage that can't be true right@?


At my low dosage and no heart condition is my .ears ringing relatively safe and expected yes? Even if its not painful I'd buy okay or even expected eats to ring for 20 mins after taking the shot

I didnt really know where to post this but this subreddit seemed the most logical one. I have been on Suboxone for 9 months, ROA intranasal and sometimes IV, dose 2mg per day. Once, or twice or a month I like to do some dope (street fentanyl) for some days and then switch back to sub with the help of using Lyrica to last 24 hours.


My problem is this - I had a week long binge last week and some 2-3 day binges weeks before that so maybe like 3-4 switches from dope to sub this month in total - and I cant sleep, AT ALL. Next two weeks are CRUCIAL for me to be in best shape due to exams and finishing school but since I switched to Suboxone on Monday - I have maybe slept 8 hours in total in 96 hours. I also have really bad RLS and when I lay down to sleep I also get sweats and the need to change sleeping positions constantly AND when I do sleep, its half sleep or semi-conscious sleep.


Last time I felt this way was when I tried Paroxetine for one day and had this similar feeling of not being able to sleep, eyelids shaking and intracranial pressure. Next day I slept fine though.


I am also taking Clonazepam 2mg in the morning and last two days took 2mg before bed aswell, no effect. I have very high tolerance to benzos though, I could eat 20mg of Clonazepam and nobody including myself could tell that I feel different or act different so I already know that sleeping pills or more benzos wouldnt help. What is causing this? I need to be able to function the next two weeks or I have wasted one year of my life and need to retake exams, not being able to move forward.


I want to point out that I have no withdrawals whatsoever, none. The sweats, RLS and insomnia starts once I lay down although RLS is present during the daytime aswell.


I am seriously considering 


A) Switching to Methadone (I was on that for 5 years before getting on Sub in 2015)

B) Selling some things and buy enough dope to get me through these last 2 weeks.

C) ???

I've been away from the sub for a little while trying to get my life sorted, and came back to see that at least two of our fellows fell victim to overdose.

It fucking sucks.

This lifestyle is dangerous and all-consuming. It grabs you by the hair and doesn't let go until you've been dragged over a cliff. I guess what I'm saying is that we could all die at any minute. I quit quitting, so I'm included in that too.

I know I haven't been super active of late, but I still want you guys to send me self-eulogies if you're deep in the lifestyle. If you pass, what happens after is for those left living, ourselves included. I only know one user from here IRL, but I know some of you have close friends and significant others on here, and leaving some piece of yourself behind is, in my mind, one of the few ways you can decide how people remember you.

That being said, I still haven't written my own, because accepting my own mortality even staring down the barrel of a well-used straw and ashen foil–easier said than done.

As always, much love,

Meh potentiator, terrifying long term effects.","Before anything I want to say I know DPH itself isn't an opiate/oid and that most if not all people reading this are going to say ""Well no shit dumb fuck who takes that much DPH and thinks they'll be okay""..but I've met a small handful of fellow dope/pill fiends that take it like I have been so even if this reaches just one person I'll be happy. I also feel like we're a community and even though it's been a while I still feel like I'm talking to a group of friends which is why I'm posting it here instead of, say /r/drugs. But anyways..this intro has dragged on enough.

Been a while since I've posted anything here. When I got off the road I got on methadone and was still using but due to money restraints and the methadone doing the trick (took 110mg but hey it helps a shit ton) I maybe get high once every other month. But one drug that I've taken almost every time I get clean to help with cravings and make my methadone feel like it's a tiny bit stronger is Diphenhydramine, or DPH/Benadryl. I found out about 8 years ago that if you take just the right amount you get a euphoric feeling similar to opiates with an after effect of anxiety that I've gotten used to and no longer bothered by. I've taken too much before (usually when I haven't taken it in a while and I don't give it long enough to kick in before taking more) and experienced the spider hallucinations, paranoia, dryer than fucking dry cotton mouth, general confusion, realizing mid conversation that the person I thought I was speaking to wasn't there, etc. but it's only happened a handful of times. I'd say the only side effect that happens almost every time that I can't stand is short term memory loss so bad sometimes that I'll forget what I'm talking about in the middle of a sentence, which makes me seem crazy to most people I don't know and a dead giveaway that I'm on it to others that know me..but up until now the positive has always trumped the negative.

Due to the fact that I've been taking it on a semi regular basis for so long my tolerance is pretty fucking high. I take around 10 if they're the 50mg pills meant for sleep or 20 if they're just Benadryl that are usually 25mg. Tolerance seems to be extremely fucking slow going down and I'm pretty sure I'll never be able to get drowsy off less than 200mg. But anyways these past couple weeks I've been getting these almost fainting spells where a pressure builds up in my head..it feels like my brain turns into cotton. Everything gets cloudy and I start to see black spots. It's fucking terrifying and I have to sharply and quickly inhale and walk around to make it stop. My dumb ass figured it was a one time thing and didn't slow anything down even though it was slowly getting more intense and worse as the time went on. (Note that lately I've been dosing 2 or 3 times in a 24 hour period..meaning I've been taking around 1,500mg some days)

Last night was what finally made me stop. Instead of the fuzzy pressure dizzy spells coming in waves, it felt like it was happening every time I turned my head. A couple times I was very close to giving into the feeling because it got so intense and I was listening to music while I was doing dishes and a heavy bass line was in one of them and when it hit my eyes went in the back of my head and I caught myself on my counter before falling but it took everything in me to stay ""awake"". Not that it was making me super sleepy..it just felt like if I gave into these head rushes I'd pass out which made me afraid of the possibility of a stroke or seizure which is fucking terrifying. Then I was shaking. I'm talking full on tremors where if I held my hand out most people would have probably thought I was faking it and being dramatic because of how my hands looked like a fish out of water they were shaking so hard. It was then that I started to lean more towards seizure than stroke and that's what this feeling had been all along. I looked it up (took me like 5 minutes due to the shaking just to type 'can DPH cause seizures') and sure enough if taken long enough and in high enough doses it can lower the seizure threshold similar to how Tramadol does. 

My fiancé came over like he does every night and surprisingly I was able to keep it together way better than I thought I would. One of the main reasons I think is because I felt safer with him there due to knowing if I went into a seizure or something there was at least someone there with me who could call 911. The scariest aspect of this whole thing was thinking about being conscious but not able to do anything if I were to have a stroke/seizure and the pure terror I'd feel knowing no help was coming and I was probably gonna die like this. The effects seemed to start becoming less intense after about 30 minutes I think because I was finally calming down, and after about an hour I was just feeling the usual cloudy/sleepy/slightly euphoric feeling I was familiar with. 

As most of you know though..nothing can usually scare us enough to never do it again and I'm already telling myself if I just start taking it before bed and in lower doses I'll be fine..but so far I've had an unfamiliar voice of reason that steps in right away and tells those thoughts to fuck off which is nice I guess.

But to anyone who has either recently started down the DPH rabbit hole (many think it's an amazing potentiator because of the initial euphoria it causes that feels like opioids tricking them into thinking it brought their buzz back. I'm not saying it's not a potentiator at all because it does help..just not as much as people say.) or are considering it- just remember this post. In small to moderate doses you'll be fine..but the pure horror I felt last night wasn't cool at all and I don't want anyone else (especially the majority of the people who post here) to go through it. I understand junkie nature is to tell me to fuck off and do it anyways but no harm in trying.

I miss you guys and hope y'all are nodding into oblivion today and that none of you stay sick all day..it's just hard to be on this board without getting cravings that are out of control. There's already been a heroin dealer that's moved into the apartment below me..I don't need more temptations..but I'm hoping sooner than later I can be strong enough to browse and talk to all you beautiful dope fiends again. But until then, know I'm here in spirit. Like Jesus in that painting of the guy shooting up and Jesus having the same arm as the one the guys shooting dope into. Love and nods guys!",1464280164.0

I know (or assume) this is simply related to the fact that my ""guy"" is mainly dealing with college kids like myself that have expendable money and enjoy drugs (enough to move to a legal weed state).  
 
It is extremely difficult, because everyone and their mother sells weed - so a weed dealer doesn't really get you anywhere in terms of finding opiates. (Not to imply every herb dealer is into pills or H, just seems more prevalent in areas not legalized). 

I find myself in serious pain and use for medicinal purposes as well as recreational. I've only recently been in such agonizing pain that I've been trying to find someone more professional and reliable. I know I'm reaching, those terms and 'opiate dealer' don't usually go hand in hand. 

Thinking hard here - I've grown up with my current connect/s so they're obviously trusted. Tried open-air in the cities and even mountain/more rugged towns and discovered I'm really not about it but I'm always open to making it work. Anyone have tips on finding a new connect?

4lczok,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/4lczok/the_grey_world_of_suboxone/,46,https://redd.it/4lczok,TerrysFriendHarry,The Grey World of Suboxone,"I really suck at not doing heroin. 


I suck so much that I need to take a drug that renders me physically immune to opiates. I’ve been on Suboxone for a month now. The first week was wonderful. As that first strip dissolved in my mouth the monkey on my back slowly retracted its claws from deep within my shoulder blades. For the first time in over a year my thoughts weren’t dominated by heroin. It felt like I could breathe for the first time in ages, like I finally had my life back. 


Now I’m not so sure I want it back. 


That’s just like me, isn’t it? I never know what the fuck I want. I’m always caught up in how things used to be, watching movies of the past while the present slips by behind my back. Suboxone is not like other opiates. Initially it offered a slight high, but that quickly faded. It offers the same irritability, excessive sweating, pinned pupils, and low sex drive as other opiates, without any of that pesky euphoria or contentment. I’m stuck in drug purgatory, a grey world between sobriety and withdrawal where I’m just sort of… Ok. 


“We’ve got a bit of a problem here, Harry…” Dr. Matthews says as he opens up a manila folder. My heartrate jumps but slows back down as I notice he already has my next script written out on his pad. “Your urine tested clean, so I know you haven’t been using…” He continues as he thumbs through page after page. These cocksuckers run a tight ship. I’m tested weekly for any and all drugs, including alcohol. Can you believe that shit? I certainly can’t. But like any good junky, I came prepared for this kind of fuckery. My tests are every Friday. Alcohol is out of my system within three days. Alcohol is far from my weapon of choice in the fight against my head, but it’ll do. 


“The problem… Hiccup! Ugh, excuse me…” Dr. Matthews grunts. Dr. Matthews is an obese middle aged man that stinks of cigarettes. The whole concept of fat doctors is one I’ve always found funny. The jokes really do write themselves, don’t they? But hey, I’m a junky, I get it. He’s got a double chin, I’ve got track marks. Neither of us want to be here right now. I wonder what poor choices led him to his side of the desk. Dr. Matthews circles two numbers on a sheet and slides the folder towards me. “See this? That’s your urinalysis. Every week we send your urine over to a lab, and they tell us exactly how much Suboxone is in your system each week. I’m not gonna bore you with the details, but your numbers are very low. You’re only getting about 40% of your medication at the rate you’re going, which means one of two things… There’s a problem with ingestion, or… You’ve been selling your medicine.” 


I haven’t been selling my subs, though the thought has certainly crossed my mind. Once I saw how hard these guys go, though, I decided against it. I got bitched out by Dr. Matthews last week for having low numbers, and knew I’d hear the same shit this week. My subs come in an orange film, not unlike the Listerine strips that dissolve in your mouth. I have to take these god damn things sublingually, by letting the strip dissolve in my mouth over thirty minutes. Thirty god damn minutes. Why they can’t just give me a fucking pill is beyond me…


I sigh and look at the floor. I’ve rehearsed this in my head all week. “I figured this would come up. The reason my numbers are low this week, is because, well… I uh… I’ve been experiencing some… Embarrassing side effects.” I begin. Dr. Matthews furrows his brow and nods for me to continue. I pull a pill bottle out of my pocket with two unused Suboxone strips inside. “I skipped my dose on Saturday. I was really, really, constipated. It had been over a week since I, uh… Had a bowel movement. Obviously having been addicted to heroin in the past this wasn’t anything I hadn’t dealt with before, y’know? And what I used to do is just wait ‘till withdrawal set in and it’d usually, y’know… Come out.” I sell my story well. Dr. Matthews opens up the bottle, checks the contents, and nods. “Well, that’d certainly explain it. But you really shouldn’t be skipping your doses, Harry. That withdrawal sets in and the cravings will come right back, tenfold. You have to be vigilant. Don’t let this happen again, alright? Take a stool softener or a laxative next time. Here’s your script.” “Thanks Dr. Matthews, my numbers will be higher next week, I promise.” 


The same pharmacist that once sold me my syringes now fills my Suboxone script. I must admit, being a legal drug addict is pretty cool. I can go right into the pharmacy and get my goods instead of waiting around for hours for a phone call that might never come. I sigh as I put a strip in my mouth and the tongue-numbing chemical citrus taste burns my taste buds. I extensively researched any and all methods of abusing these damn things to no avail. I did try shooting them a few times, but it did little more than harden my veins. 


I don’t know what I expected to get from this shit. I thought it would finally free me of the heroin cravings that haunted me whether awake or asleep, and it does. I’m numb, but not the numb I’d like to be. Without the euphoria to supplement the numbness, I’m just sort of… here. Not happy or sad. I’m used to either being in a state of chemically-induced bliss or crippling, suicidal depression. I’m not used to being… normal.  


I miss boners. Masturbation has gone from one of my favorite pastimes to a chore. When I do decide to go clean out the gutters downstairs, it’s nearly impossible to finish, and if I do, the payoff is minimal. In my previous attempts at getting clean, the real world would rush back at me at full volume and ultra-high resolution. My emotions would come back too. Music would give me goosebumps, sad commercials would make me cry. It didn’t always feel good, but I felt alive. I guess that’s what life is for most people. 


And now I’m here again. Why am I still surprised? I can go ahead and add Suboxone to the long list of drugs that can’t fix me. It may keep me off heroin, but I have to get off them eventually, and when I do… What then? 


The depression is coming back. Ah, who am I kidding? That bastard never left. He leaves little clues around my head to let me know he’s still there. I spent all of Sunday in bed, rising only to piss, take another Sub, some Benadryl, and some whiskey, which when taken together, induces a deep slumber. While I’m no longer technically a *heroin* addict, I still do heroin addict shit. 


I sit on the toilet, but nothing comes out. I sit at the computer, but nothing comes out. E-mails pile up, but I’m too anxious to check them. It’s been so long since I’ve written anything, and when I do write, its shit. Fuck. I thought this would make things different, but it’s more of the same. 


Unable to take more of the same, I call one of my few remaining links to the craziness: Middle Man Mike. He doesn’t answer. Stan just got out of jail. It figures that I’ve gotten out just as he’s gotten back in. He asked me to help him out, but I decline. Juanita is on vacation, back home in the Dominican Republic, not that she’d ever meet up with a stranger anyway. The tables have turned while he was away, and I could become his middle man. But it’s hot out there, and I’m fine inside. 


I text Middle Man Mike looking for blow. Maybe coke will help me get this fucking book done. In the meantime I head over to the liquor store. A group of kids wait nervously outside the door, just out of view from the owner. I smile as I get out of my car, walking slowly past them before one finally gathers the balls to ask me…


“Hey, mister?!” 


The other kids burst into poorly-controlled laughter. “Yeah?” I reply. “C-could you, um… Get us something? Please?” I take a peek into the store. The owner’s busy. These kids can’t be older than 14, should I really do this? Then again, 14 year olds can’t drive…


“Alright, alright, what do you guys want? Quick, I don’t the guy in there to see us…” I say to the group. Each kid fishes around in their pockets hurriedly and hands me a few crumpled dollar bills. “We want a handle of Rubinoff, and two packs of Marlboros.” One says. “Grape rubinoff!” Adds one of the others. “Ruby, huh? Alright guys, tell you what, wait around the other side of the store. I’ll be right out, ok?” I tell them. I grab their Rubinoff and a fifth of Jameson for myself. I thought I smelled weed while I was out there, so I decide to spoil them. “Yeah, can I also get a pack of Game cigarillos, too? Thanks brotha.” 


“Thanks man!” One of the kids says when I return. They look at the plastic jug of vodka like it’s Crown Royal. “No problem guys. No driving, alright!?” “Aww man he got us blunt wraps!” I hear one of them say as I walk back to my car. 


I check my phone as I set down my bag and crack the bottle of Jameson. No messages. “Fucking Mike…” I mumble to myself. I aggressively pour a stiff glass of Jameson, admitting defeat to my coke cravings. I pick a random episode of The Wire and get my buzz on. Suboxone makes drinking less pleasurable too. The drunk feels almost dirty, more sedating, and I fight a losing battle against sleep by chugging Monster energy drinks. I’m really starting to hate this shit… 


I wake up to a news feed full of RIP’s and old pictures. A former classmate of mine passed away, apparently of an overdose. That’s the second one this year. This fentanyl shit is out of control. Rest in Peace, Alex. Another one gone too soon… 


“You heard about Alex, right?” Jack asks me over the phone. 


“Yeah, I heard. Fucked up, right?” 


“Yeah, I didn’t even know he fucked with that shit. Guess there’s been a hot batch going around or something. Must make you happy to be off that shit, huh?” 


“Huh? Oh, yeah. Yeah, man. Absolutely. Glad to be done with that bullshit….” 


Though I’m no longer a heroin addict, I still lie like one.

We've been together almost 2 years and he's the man of my dreams. He told me about shooting heroin Jan 2015 and has been trying to get clean since. There have been so many relapses. He's been to rehabs and psych wards, he got sectioned, he got a heart infection and was in the hospital for 2 months. On my 21st birthday he showed up to my parents place fucked up on Xanax. I've been to meetings and doctors appointments and I took a course to learn about CPR and using Narcan. I've called ambulances when he's overdosed and when I've broken up with him and he's called me saying he's going to kill himself I run right back to try and get him help. 

I know every time he's high. I beg him to be honest and he just can't. I used to be happy all the time, wanted to fuck him 24/7, did great in school and had mad friends. I feel so empty now. And so old. We fight all the time and I'm so suspicious and angry and heartbroken. 


Last night he told me shot up again and I was trying to figure out how to make it okay. I was looking at a picture he sent me of himself and thinking that it would be okay because I would do anything for him I would find a way to keep him safe and then I saw in the corner of the picture was a needle and a spoon. I know I can't stay. I'm so scared I'm going to catch something or start using drugs. I keep catching myself wanting to try heroin just to make this all stop for a little while. I'm so scared I'll get pregnant and bring a baby into this environment or wake up to find him dead. 

I am leaving tomorrow. I'm going to put everything I own in garbage bags and I'm catching a flight out of the country. I am wondering how to make it better for him. Do I tell him I'm leaving or why? Do I try to get him to check into rehab? Do I stay friends with him? Do I tell his parents that he lives with that he's relapsed? What if he dies? How do I leave someone I love? ",1464383728.0

I just found out that one of my best friends (more like a brother) is basically dying. He is in the hospital right now and the docs are saying his liver is ""gone"" and his kidneys are failing. He is on dialysis to attempt to get his kidneys functioning better I guess, I don't really know much about that, but the docs say they need to get his kidneys functioning better before they are going to even worry about his liver. Ultimately, my friend needs a liver transplant  if he is going to survive, but it isn't looking good and his status is ""day-to-day"". 

My friend is 29. Years of drinking every night has led to his untimely demise. I was following down the same path as him not too long ago, but a 5 day hospital stay where I was throwing up blood was the wake up call I needed to not touch the stuff again. I have been clean (from alcohol) for about 16 months. I wish my friend had a less serious wake up call like I did in order to turn his life around, but we have to live or die with the choices we make I guess.

I don't understand how alcohol is still legal while so many other things are not. Alcohol is so extremely dangerous it just blows my mind. I understand that other drugs may be more likely to kill you, but that is usually if you are doing too much, not necessarily from extended use. If you drink alcohol every day for a long period it seems like you are more likely to die from that than using heroin everyday for a long time (excluding overdoses).

I don't know where I'm going with this, I guess I'm just getting it off my chest to cope with the potential loss of my friend, and my frustration on how something so dangerous could be legal while other things like heroin carry such a negative opinion. I'm sorry if this doesn't make a whole lot of sense, I just needed to get it out there and didn't proof read, so it is probably riddled with bad grammar and confusing wording.

Peace and love to all my opiates brothers and sisters, please be safe out there and if you choose to drink, please be responsible :)

told my parents two days ago... so after this weekend I'll be singing up for methadone then rehab/detox after that.... kinda nervous but fuck this sucks lol

love you all. we're more than dope... we just really liked dope. thats ok life is fucked, but try to make it a little better for yourself.

good luck today fam

edit : sat in a parking lot for four hours because my dealer nodded off, but finally got well. i cant wait to not have to deal with that stupid shit.

anyways i have a question for you guys about detox... what kind of medication do they give you? I'm worried after I sign up and ship to the rehab house I'm just gonna end up super sick and miserable while they give me a sub and xanex or something.. because frankly I could do that myself for a lot cheaper. Now that I've told my parents I have a lot more accountability.. so I wonder if I should rehab or lock myself in my dad's yurt in the middle of the woods with some benzos, kratom, subs, pot, lopermine (or whatever that diarrhea med is), and mushrooms, LSD, and DMT... both are valid options, and if I'm just gonna suffer in rehab I'd rather just have my dad lock me up and medicate me.

My girl leaves for NYC on the 19th of June for a couple months, so I'd like to maintain on methadone until then... but people are telling me quitting methadone is worse/harder? So maybe I should just slam some dilaudid for a month instead?

tldr; wanna quit, but scared like a bitch of withdraws... last time I tried I ended up taking four 8mg subs and was the sickest I had ever felt until I finally had my dealer stop by and slammed four points... so, just a little apprehensive.

Silver

Silver and white

Mix it

Mix it down

Mix it until its completely brown

Tight

Tighten it tighter

A sting, a burn

Fuck it's dull

This one's had too many turns

Then there's red, a beautiful red

I should be asleep, asleep in bed

Release, release it now

Pump it in

Push it down

Eyes roll back

Fix complete

Slump down low into the seat

But somethings wrong

Still not satisfied

If I had more

I might have died

So I sit

I dream of red

Dreaming

Wishing

Hoping

That I were...

... Not in this fucking mess

Everyone has always told me they love seeing the results, and for their to be results I am going to need this cooperation. I had gotten 38 responses so far and I could only use **16** of them!! Whether it was because people only answered half the questions, because they put multiple answers for one question, or because they want to argue about whether they have a dick or not.

What do you guys want to see surveyed? In the past it was: 

1) Age: 

2) Gender: 

3) Race: 

4) Country of residence:

5) Primary route of administration: 

6) Opioid of choice: 

This year I was going to add:

7) Length of use:

8) Tobacco or vape:

Is there anything else you want to see?

By the way:

Race is defined by the OMB and US Census Bureau as:

*White* – A person having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa.

*Black or African American* – A person having origins in any of the Black racial groups of Africa.

*American Indian or Alaska Native* – A person having origins in any of the original peoples of North and South America (including Central America) and who maintains tribal affiliation or community attachment.

*Asian* – A person having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, or the Indian subcontinent including, for example, Cambodia, China, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippine Islands, Thailand, and Vietnam.

*Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander* – A person having origins in any of the original peoples of Hawaii, Guam, Samoa, or other Pacific Islands.

Is **this** a problem?

Gender is male or female. What do you prefer to be addressed as **right now.** I have no interest in getting into a debate with anyone over what they really are, so what do you go by??

2. Are there any OTC tablets I can mix into the wash that will be acidic and not (greatly) affect the taste of the PSC?

Unfortunately my arms are dunzo. No veins whatsoever. I have been getting off on some very caustic OTC shit that made so much scar tissue, i'll hit, but it will goto my hand instead of the other way and burn so bad..
So I gave that up. Even though it was an intense rush that I loved, but was very quick, and went away.. then left you talking kinda goofy for hours.

i'm on slightly less than 2mg suboxone, but dillies have always broken through, no problem at all. even 2mg ones. 

So I get 10mg dilaudid in a beautiful IV vial. I choose a giant vein in my ankle i never used, but what the heck.  I try 2 ml first as a tester, nothing. I decide to fill the rig, and just go real slow. I shoot 3 more ml, nothing, 3 more, nothing.... this whole ordeal takes 5 minutes. I am going SLOW.  i finish everything.  I am also on xanax which worries me SLIGHTLY.. but not really. I can take 20mg and it will barely effect me. thats what vendors who you order 20, and they send you 300 get you. 

I now feel it creeping up slooowwwly. i feel good.  I filled a rig with suboxone.. I also have naltrexone pills.. i could make a solution with those if I choose, if this gets to be too much.

But I already feel it subsiding. that was about 25 minutes ago. 
Just a good i could nod out but i wont feeling.. I am staying awake, I will stand up till I am confident nothing bad will happen.  

I am very cautious when it comes to this stuff... I know my suboxone has my tolerance up quite high.. ive been on it 4 years.. and I know if I get 3 bags of fire from my guy  (which ive done twice) it will break through.

It's fading now.  That felt very nice. I know the rush is the kicker, but the drug stays with you for a bit, so I need to stay vigilant. 

I should be able to take my subs tomorrow no problem, as I always have if a dilaudid came my way. just sucks my arms are a No zone right now. 
Will keep you updated more if anything special or not so special occurs.

This question was based on a conversation with my brother who asked me if heroin is really as dangerous as the media claims, since he knows that Kratom (which I recently introduced him to, and which I use daily) is under fire from the media as well.  I told him what I know, but then realized that I actually know very little about the ""heroin crisis.""  For me, the reason I don't use heroin is because my uncle tells me that it's ""way too damn nice,"" and that was enough to keep me from wanting it, and leaving other drugs in its shadow forever.

I think you should be careful what you say online in general, and I wasn't intending for anyone to say anything incriminating here.",1464622879.0

Even if you don't like trams you might if..,"So, some people (with low tooerance) get high as fuck on em, some don't. It's been researched to death, it's basically (I mean BASICally) it's an ssri that metabolites into a full agonist opioid. Some people don't have the liver enzyme to convert to o-desmatramadol there for get a small amount but pretty much everyone will feel the ssri effects, especially people who have taken ssri's. The opiate is quasi-fent type opiod about equal strength from what I understand, although I think it's closer to bup. 

I am one of those ppl btw, if I'm sober and I take 2-3 trams I feel so fucking good, I would take that right there over any other drug, period. But 2 things causes it to loose it's luster; taken daily (tolly like sub where you stop feeling it but it's still there) and cross tolly from another drug of choice will make it insignificant. 

So since say I'm on h right now, bout a. 15 of tar smoked. I drank 2 energy drinks and took an l-theanine for a cleaner buzz, and took one tramadol. Then I smoked bud and I'm high as fuck nodding while reading this. Which may sound normal, but a 15 wouldn't get me nodding high, maybe if I smoked.tthen laid down I'd feel pretty good. Tramadol kicked in a few minutes after I smoked, smoked a bowl, high as fuck, noddin and fading off and drifting in n out lol. Feel greeeeeat. 

Moral of the story and tl/dr smoking bud with trams is cool, especially if you metabolize good. Basically you used some dank nugs to potentiate a fent type opiod that came from the tram, takes >45 minutes metabolize.. Take 1-4 trams, whatever tickles your balls/nipples. wait about 45 minutes, but not much longer than that, don't wait too long. Do your DOC and enjoy., has long half life too.

So of the dozen or so times I've gone threw the horrid withdrawal, I thought I'd try using subs this time to make it easier.

I was already throwing up at that point, but when the subs hit ( within 10 minutes ) I can only relate it to what dying would be like.  I started puking again in the bathroom and my bowels just opened and expelled those rock-hard dog shits that were all so accustomed to.  Yeah, in my pants and on the floor.  I couldn't puke in the sink while shitting in the toilet at the same time and holy fuck it came out of nowhere.  It's been 4 days since that and I'm still feeling fucking horrible.  I dosed subs a couple more times over the next couple days but all shit seemed to do was drag it out.  Like a slower shitty withdrawal that comes in waves.  Fuck that.

I never liked it during my shoulder surgery as it made me feel numb. Before I found out about DPH I was too itchy to like it and half the time I get opi rage. I have tried vicodin, oxy, opana, PST percs, and codeine all in that order. I use one-two times a week when I am home, but when I am at college its about once to twice a month. The only time I really understood why people get addicted was when I got opana. It made me so nauseous I had to use ginger. However, those are really hard to get so I have only used them about 6 times. I even went through some minor withdrawal. Did y'all become addicted when something bad happened to you? I even did not become reliable when I broke up with the love of my life. Opis are just really hard to find. I also had a scare one time with them and almost fell out. I had 4 bars the night before and sniffed Opana early in the morning and fell in and out for 6 hours. then passed out for 8. Watched 2 kill bills but don't remember a second of it. Now when I use, I use vicodin, codeine (which some reason are strong for me) or the rare perc. My old fave thing was too take two trams and 2 vics. The comeup was powerful, but tram got me anxious and feeling weird before sleep, and feeling awful no matter how much I take the next day. Now I understand the reason why people would use everyday, however the side effects for me are not worth it. Constipation, less dopamine, too noddy or too speedy, etc. Any word of advice for avoiding addiction? Besides the obvious to just stop now. For me opis are not a huge escape unless they are the strong ones, which makes me nervous ever since the time I almost fell out. I would rather take bars and drink to escape and smoke a boatload of weed. I drink about once a week, use benzos for the hangover, and take opis once. I am sober 3-4 days of the week and have no problems with sobriety. Sorry for the ramble took 3 codeine's and 2 10 mg vics. Any input is appreciated. Also I only think about opis once or twice a week. I think about smoking dro more. Thanks guys. I really like this community, I think most of you have a great sense of humor and it just sounds like opis cure your depression, which I have suffered from before. I am also doing brain therapy called neurofeedback therapy and feel better than ever. Also this is not supposed to be condescending or anything. Addiction runs on my dads side.

4llp5a,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/4llp5a/the_sidebar_has_the_ultimate_withdrawal_survival/,13,https://redd.it/4llp5a,zjciprazz,The sidebar has the ultimate withdrawal survival guide; how about some strategies for preparing the week or two before detox?,"The simplest strategy i can think of would be tapering down prior to kicking, but I wanted to survey the community here and see if people had any other more advanced techniques. 


**I am aware that a majority of the time when people kick, it is forced on them last minute with no time for prep, so these types of strategies may not be as common; people run out of money, get caught by a parent or spouse, their connect dries up, etc. For the purpose of this post, i would like to assume ideal circumstances, meaning time to prep, access to all types of drugs or medications, money to purchase these things, and the willpower to follow whatever plan is implemented. I would also like to assume the habit being kicked is a bundle a day IV heroin habit.** 



Here are some things that have crossed my mind:


- Tapering down, possibly using potentiators like DXM and Tagament to allow you to drop your dose without experiencing as much discomfort. I also have come across pages describing supplements that can lower tolerance, like Agmatine Sulfate. Not sure if it actually works. 



- Using mood boosting drugs, supplements and vitamins to help your body prepare for detox. For example, taking something that is supposed to help with depression, like st johns wort, or Tianeptine. The idea would be to have the effects of these supplements kick in right around the same time you stop using to help with the mental aspect of the withdrawal. 



- Jumping between different opiates and routes of administration prior to stopping. For example, going from IV to Nasal, or using pills for a few days prior to detoxing. I'm not sure if this would have any effect at all, but i figure if your body is used to receiving drugs in a certain way, then switching your ROA could allow your body to start getting used to the changes, while still taking in opiates to keep you from going into withdrawal. If IV use gives you a rush, and you switch to nasal, it would let your body get used to no longer having that rush every few hours. 



- Lastly, jumping onto an opiate with a longer half life like methadone for a few days (tapering during this time,) then going back to a shorter opiate for 2 - 3 days, then letting yourself get sick, holding out until it gets real bad, then doing a very short suboxone taper, (less than 5 days.)



And then once you enter into the withdrawal phase, using the withdrawal survival guide on the sidebar to ride that out.",1464548232.0

WOW, it was almost on par with some good dope. The sedation was really strong though, I had blurry vision, and the legs were shorter.

Anyone else able to compare these? Which do you prefer?

But try and love one, and then see if you can look me square in the eyes and tell me that you didn’t get addicted to trying to fix them.

If you’re lucky, they recover. If you’re really lucky, you recover, too.

Loving a drug addict can and will consume your every thought. Watching their physical deterioration and emotional detachment to everything will make you the most tired insomniac alive. You will stand in the doorway of their bedroom and plead with them that you “just want them back.” If you watch the person you love disappear right in front of your eyes long enough, you will start to dissolve too.

Those not directly affected won’t be able to understand why you are so focused on your loved one’s well-being, especially since, during the times of your family member’s active addiction, they won’t seem so concerned with their own.

Don’t become angry with these people. They do not understand. They are lucky to not understand. You’ll catch yourself wishing that you didn’t understand, either. “What if you had to wake up every day and wonder if today was the day your family member was going to die?” will become a popular, not-so-rhetorical question.

Drug addiction has the largest ripple effect that I have ever witnessed firsthand.

It causes parents to outlive their children. It causes jail time and homelessness. It causes sisters to mourn their siblings. It causes nieces to never meet their aunts. It causes an absence before the exit.
You will see your loved one walking and talking, but the truth is, you will lose them far before they actually succumb to their demons; which, if they don’t find recovery, is inevitable.

Drug addiction causes families to come to fear a ringing phone or a knock on the door. Drug addiction causes bedrooms and social media sites to become memorials. It causes the “yesterdays” to outnumber the “tomorrows.” It causes things to break; like the law, trust and homes. Drug addiction causes statistics to rise and knees to fall, as praying seems like the only thing left to do sometimes.

People have a way of pigeonholing those who suffer from addiction. They call them “trash,” “junkies” or “criminals,” which is hardly ever the truth. Addiction is an illness. Addicts have families and aspirations.

You will learn that drug addiction doesn’t discriminate. It doesn’t care if the addict came from a loving home or a broken family. Drug addiction doesn’t care if you are religious. Drug addiction doesn’t care if you are a straight-A student or a drop-out. Drug addiction doesn’t care what ethnicity you are. Drug addiction will show you that one decision and one lapse in judgment can alter the course of an entire life.

Drug addiction doesn’t care. Period. But you care. You will learn to hate the drug but love the addict. You will begin to accept that you need to separate who the person once was with who they are now.

It is not the person who uses, but the addict. It is not the person who steals to support their habit, but the addict. It is not the person who spews obscenities at their family, but the addict. It is not the person who lies, but the addict.

And yet, sadly… it is not the addict who dies, but the person.",1464708899.0

My habit escalated past what I imagined it ever would, well in reality I knew it was just more of a 'I'm too much of a pussy to off myself, dope do it for me' decision, the amounts alone as far as what goes on the scale then into the spoon, how much I spend, and what I buy deserves a bit of written reflection I think. Last summer I had a cushy NYC area internship that paid decently (for an intern) and in the first week I went from an honest, legitimate chipper to an everyday user.  I was paying too much for these buns, definitely no question, but holy shit these things were good despite not even being that heavy.  I was a terrible employee, not that I ever used during or before work, but I'd always come in still kind of high from a nice xanax/dope binge fighting a war inside to stay awake and produce the kind of bullshit dumbed-down asskissing client presentations the company passed off as greatness and bullshitting my way out of getting fired for it.  I experienced my first awful withdrawals, first boulder-sized and consistency shits as well as hemorrhoids from pushing too hard after a full week had gone by with nothing, and having to overdraw from an atm and do sneaky shit for food while considering beginning dealing again except this time to basically strangers in order to be be able to work the next day.  Some bridges were scorched a bit to put it nicely as is standard in business that contributes nothing, but I got out with a pair of good enough references, a couple thousand dollars left for the fall, and by the skin of my teeth, I wasn't fired!  So it was great really other than the job/field which sucked and I had no interest in going back either.  In the fall, other than a few failed meet-ups with people I met online in these two cities of Minnesota, all but one was a bust - getting shorted, robbed, or nearly arrested - and the decent one dried up almost immediately.  Fuck that shit, I just would order a gram at a time on darknets from the only vendor whose price was remotely justified - which I may be back to in not that long - and managed to binge on grams, be kinda sick for a day then take a week or two off and repeat.  I stuck to my budget and was happy only snorting even when narcan and syringes suddenly were made available locally in our midwest frozen chunk of paradise out of nowhere.  

Back this winter, I returned to an area near, like, a pretty large city in Illinois not to be specific or anything, for my final courses to complete my bachelors degree.  I snorted a jab every week, sometimes a bit more or less time, but generally much less as life progressed, my account balance continuously got smaller, and I kept on excitedly hopping on the L and handing my middle $100 a week after a 90 minute train/bus journey which turned into $200 per week or maybe a little more, two with some amazing control, for a slightly better deal and so on.  

At this point, I decided I was sick of spending $200 per week to not be high, have nosebleeds every morning and pull out pieces of flesh to clear the way for a deviated septum and decided to give the needle another try - go big or go home I thought: maybe I'll die, or maybe I'll bottom out and finally have some desire to stop. As I'm writing, I'm dissolving the crushed up pieces of a nice .15 g-.15 g speedball now; the coke is actually really good, way too expensive, but I'd rather pay 50-60% more than I'd like for several times higher purity than average out on 'dem streets than pay 30/g for 95 percent baking soda and lidocaine; the dope is standard Chicago grey raw bought locally (varies batch to batch from I'd say like 5-8/9 out of 10 in quality, the 5 just one time though maybe it was just me idk, it's always been a struggle for me to decide if it's rerocked or not because it either was cut or smashed off a hydraulically compressed brick or rerocked, but considering certain logistics of its path to me I kind of doubt they'd have bothered and Chi grey is almost always a pain to break unlike the off white variety of tan soft-chunk, easily-breakable 10/10 shit I got once in my life from somewhere on the East Coast that made me fall out and come back 6 hours later with almost no hearing, blurry vision, and projectile vomiting bile after snorting a point if that.  And no, there was no fent.  I wish I had a g of that to bang through now but that's life.  After my first non-using dealer disappeared very quickly after making me think I'd finally made it in addict life out of middlemanland - with hits like 'I need all the money now to buy both our stuff and only I can go in, take my backpack with empty, used points and some other useless but illegal paraphernalia for collateral' '5 min bro' 'yo can you stand around the corner there bro while this goes down' - after returning to my area in January said happy birthday by getting me for $200 rather than continuing to make $40 or so at a time because being an economist at the federal reserve bank just wasn't cutting it for supplying all that dope she needed to inject into her skin since her veins are made of lava and making an attempt at finding one is *hard*; I'm sure she has a heart-wrenching story of what dope reduced her to from her former self, making her a completely different person whose actions against others were and are now absolutely no reflection upon her own character and totally beyond her own control with the wise perspective of six weeks clean.

So here I am now, graduating in mere weeks at 22 with a math degree, a job offer that matched exactly what I asked for on salary - in hindsight I should have gone balls out and asked for 70/80k per year but I'll be fine where I'm at for now - with 80% paid dental and health insurance, some percent match on 401k, 4 weeks of PTO, the works.  The key parts are the PTO and insurance.  After years of hiding my drug problem and not being able to get serious help for depression and other shit and just self medicating my way through the day with increasingly dangerous drugs and ROAs, I finally have the ability to go to rehab at some point without feeling like I'm wasting anybody's money.  I have a solid 40k to pay in total for student loans with the added interest, but if I pay it over a long period like they want you to it'll be a pretty small fraction of my monthly income or I can pay it twice as fast.  But here I am - moving away from one of America's dope capitals back to Minnesota, where the dope is always underweight and in ripped, tied and/or bic-melted POS bags and basically just a maybe finger-sized rock of what some dude hauled out of Chicago and sprinkled some dorm into after crushing it all up and making everyone bend over for $20/$40 points/q-gram but in reality .15-.22 g bags.  In other words, I have some - not a huge, but finally some desire to quit - but moving from this easy, great local h access is hard.  At the same time, the thing that always forced me to stop, money, is about to not be an issue.  Unless I can't manage to keep it under 2k in spending per month, I have no absolute need to use if I can still do my job.  It's a really weird fork in the road to be in, and I think I'm going to try rehab largely to try to meet people like me - which is something I've never managed to do the last few years, not wanting to go full into the using crowd to maintain my facade of innocence but hanging out with people who can't even imagine what this addiction is like.  Anyway, that's more than enough writing for a while.  Should I give the evening rehab program they're suggesting to me a shot, save up a few weeks and go for full outpatient day-long or inpatient detox and rehab, or just keep going until shit gets worse and I lose my job or the rest of my veins?",1464682648.0

I need some advice!  I MAY have to pass a drug test in 1.5 days. I have been clean from heroin for 9 days and I messed up and used today. I used about a tenth and a half of some pretty decent H. I'm an addict and made a mistake by using today! I couldn't get it out of my head and it was easily accessible. Now I'm trippin BAD because I could get tested on Wednesday (June 1)  around noon  (it is Monday, May 30, 4:24pm). 

I am 28 year old female,  5'3"", 130 pounds, and have an athletic build. I know thc sticks to fat cells and don't really know if that is a factor with heroin. I don't think it is... Just putting it out there In case that information is needed. 

Anyway, I read that apple cider vinegar along with tons of water can clear out my system pretty fast. Does anyone know if this works? How much should I drink? If anyone has any other suggestions to clean my system out, PLEASE share! 

And yes I know... Not using is the best way to pass a drug test and I feel stupid because I was clean and didn't have to worry about it. But, the fact of the matter is: I did use and I feel guilty about it. Please just advice; no judging please! 

Thank you in advance for your suggestions and advice. 

Peace and Love. ",1464643625.0

However, I've been kinda surprised to see a bunch of people greeting these posts with hostility, telling clean people they don't belong here and that they should go over to /r/opiatesrecovery. 

I'd love to hear some other opinions on this, because it seems pretty fucked up and mean-spirited to me. Obviously this isn't the place for people to be preaching or attempting to push NA/AA on people, but I think you have to be pretty unhappy in your own skin if reading someone else's message of hope/happiness is so upsetting as to trigger you.

I'm fiddling with the idea of performing a CWE on these pills; however, I'm unsure of what I stand to gain as I've heard that the acetemenophen mixes well with the actual active agent.

Need Help!!!,"So, I'm a hardcore Tram Nodder, I just love stretching out with some new bitch I found on /r/BigBootyHoes and then Hulu and Fingerbanging them while I'm Trammed out of my gourd, and I've got a new problem that I'm having a hard time dealing with. I normally get my Lil' Brown Bombers out of my dad's stash. He always hides them shits in a plywood box covered with swastikas, Dixie Flags and Trump stickers on it (and I'm into black chicks LOL!). I have to go in there when Mammy Luther is sleepin' on account of she can't move so good or get out the bed since them doctors had to take her feet from the diabeetus. I have to sneak up under the bed and wedge the box open with my bowie knife and slide two fingers in there and grab the bottle. All the while tryin' hard not to wake up the 17 year old fucking snifflin' and snortin' pug she's got sleepin' with her named Lil' Foxworthy. So, I've been stealing these Ultramissles from Big Daddy for 3 years and I always take about 500mg to get a good nod, 750mg if I gotta give some to the girl I'm Youtube and Assplay-in' with, and about 2 days ago them shits stopped workin'. I mean, I'd get 'em and I'll be Goddamned if I didn't take 30 100mg pills and not feel a Goddamned thing. So I figgered somethin' fishy was goin' down.  Well, I done went lookin' through Big Daddy's room, his closet, Mammy Luther's knittin' bag, both outhouses, and I'll be damned, when I looked behind Daddy's '77 Smokey and the Bandit Trans-Am sitting on cinder blocks out by the woods I found his fuckin' Pill Press. Well I reckoned that I had been getting trick fucked by Big Daddy and I got mad as a goddamn hornet, stormed through the screen door, pulled out my Custom Kimber .45 pistol and lit Big Daddy's ass up like Fourth of July Fireworks down by the lake! Mammy Luther's pug Lil' Foxworthy ran in snifflin' and snortin' at me so he got his head blown plum off and Mammy Luther started hollerin' and caterwaulin' somethin' fierce about callin' the fuzz so I had to take her head clean off with my bowie knife on account of I was out of bullets. Now I need help disposing of Big Daddy's body, and Mammy Luther's fat ass dead body, but I can take care of Lil' Foxworthy. I'll just cut his ass up in little pieces and put him down the hole of the outhouse. I'm wonderin' about how to hide these bodies without spendin' the rest of my life up at Chatahoochie Correctional, cuz all 19 of my cousins work there and it'd be awkward.
