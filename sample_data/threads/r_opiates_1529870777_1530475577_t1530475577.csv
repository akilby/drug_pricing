Usually i use methadone as I'm prescribed it and more is available. 90-100mg is usually good pain relief and 130-140mg is a good buzz, each lasting pretty much the entire day

First of I should say I took a several day break from methadone so that it wouldnt interfere with the high. I got some cheap Dillies a few days ago. Last time I had them it took about 30mg insufflated to feel high (not nodding but nicely sedated and pain relief)

The other day I bought 60mg. I plugged the first 24mg, banged the next 24mg, and snorted probably 12mg and I still wasnt high. There was maybe 2-3 hours I felt like i might nod and obviously good feelings after banging some of them. Am I broken? Luckily I recently made some breakthroughs with my pain disorder and I think I could take a couple of weeks off if i had some ketamine and maybe a few benzos.

I guess a possible explanation is that plugging didnt work very well for me. The day before I had IMed 30mg and it was noticeable but not strong, thats why I chose to increase the dose that day.",1530451646.0

They didn't know you had to file taxes each year, obviously the govt like does that for us bro.  "" I dk man, maybe you didn't sign up for the program or something, my parents don't do them for me.

They think I was lying, making this shit up.  They're too young and ignorant to acknowledge their stupidity.  Now I know why my buddy's gf is always silent around our circle.  She has no idea what we're talking about.

Im 21 and my sister is 23... We live in our mothers house. She keeps on bringing this new boyfriend home who is pretty trash. He barely says hello when he comes in the door. They immediately go to her room and lock the door to do God knows what. It makes me extremely uncomfortable and angry. I try to bring it up to her in private and she try’s to slick talk me to appease me but keeps on bringing this kid over every night. Our rooms are right next to each other separated by a wall and I don’t even want to be in my room when he’s here. I think it’s extremely disrespectful on both their parts to treat my family’s house like a fuckin pork palace. I’ve brought this up to my mother and she doesn’t like it either but shes a pushover so nothing happens. My father passed away when I was 12 but he ABSOLUTELY would not stand for this shit.

Tonight I came home a couple minutes ago and I wanted to hang out with her but she opens the door to tell me her “friend” is over and immediately locked it. I had just railed 4 blues and I snapped because she just blows me off when I try to talk to her about it. They are still in there and I’m in my living room waiting for him to come out. I’m gonna have a little talk with him and tell him that he is welcome to hang out here in the daytime but he’s not welcome to shuffle in at 11 at night to fuck my sister while I gotta go hide in the other part of the house like a little bitch. Im praying that this little fuck says something I don’t like so I can swing on him and really get my point across. Shes been doing this for years with multiple boyfriends and I’m fucking sick of it. I haven’t been in a relationship since middle school but I get a decent amount of ass for a single guy probably sleep with a different girl at least 2-3 times a month. The difference between me and my sister is that I have the decency to take that shit somewhere else when my family is home like our empty upstairs apartment, the girls house, or I plan it to make sure no ones home.

Do you guys think I’m wrong for being extremely uncomfortable when she brings this guy over and locks her door while they fuck? I genuinely need to know if I am wrong for feeling disrespected by their actions. I shouldn’t have to feel uncomfortable in my own bedroom. I actually pay rent here and contribute to the household in multiple ways but my sisters a freeloading bitch. Milked my Mom’s bank account for a 4 year degree that took 6 years majoring in fucking Peace Studies (dumb liberal Bitch) and my mom literally pays her credit card bill most months because she is so immature she can’t save money. She doesn’t have a car and doesn’t even have a license so I have to drive her to work or wherever else she needs every day. I’m pretty sure my sister has never saves $1,000 in her life which is pathetic considering she has zero expenses.

Currently waiting for this squeaky little fuck to come out the room to go home so I can have a little talk with him. Hes 5 foot 5 about and im 6’1” 195 lbs lean with a decent amount of muscle mass and I know how to box. I’ve literally never lost a fight in my life except for being jumped and I’ve been in plenty.

Let me know what you guys think about this situation ASAP. I need to know if I’m out of line for thinking the shit their doing is disrespectful. Thanks guys. This bullshit is killing my high.",1530419190.0

That shit is scary.,"I am service coordinator for our local homeless population. Been around the block many times at the age of 51. Somehow never got into opiates and am very grateful for that. Anyhoo, this chick was obviously high all day. Spent most of her time on the nod, breathing fine and responsive. I didn't want to ruin her high so just kept an eye on her.

Later in the day she must have redosed because instead of nodding she flat out used the table as a pillow. Now, I may know a thing or two, but I've never actually experienced an OD. I have Narcan training which tells you how to use it, but, not when. 

So when I lifted her head off the table she held it up on her own and mumbled some shit, so, alive and breathing, right??? I stupidly let this go on another 1/2 hour. 

Again, I lifted her head, shook her and loudly announced that if she didn't come out of this I was going to ruin her high with Narcan. Only when she didn't respond to the threat of losing her high did I make the decision to use the Narcan.

Administered the Narcan. Called 911. Nothing fucking happens. She didn't magically come to like they said she would in the training. 3 minutes go by. 4, 5, no change. The paramedics arrive and take over. Still no change. I'm panicking, wondering if my inaction killed this girl. Things did not get better when the EMT asked me how long I waited, seeming to insinuate I waited too long . . .

WHAT THE FUCK!! She was breathing. How the fuck am I supposed to know the difference between someone being high as fuck and goddamn respiratory distress!!! 

She was alive when she was taken away and she better be alive tomorrow. This was my first OD. Not truly knowing what to do and when is a terrible feeling. If she lives I will resent her. If she doesn't I will relive my actions for the rest of my life and blame myself for not acting quicker.

The reason I'm posting this here is not to shame or blame any of you for anything, just to offer my perspective. This is one of my favorite subs for a number of reasons. I like to think you guys helped me to understand things better. Nevertheless, as informed as I believed myself to be, regardless of whether this poor girl lives or dies, this EXPERIENCE WAS FUCKING TERRIFYING FOR ME. I read sometimes about users treating their latest OD casually, even laughing them off because they keep Narcan on hand. Well, as I said, I may not be a user but I genuinely believed I'd know what to do and when, but, I didn't and I'm pissed off as hell that this is what it has come to, that some dumb ass like me is the difference between living and dying for some of you. That is not fair at all.

Please, don't put normies in that position. It sucks. It's unfair. It is potentially life destroying, both for the junkie and the normie. 

I asked why the Narcan didn't work and didn't get an actual answer. I don't know if she is still alive or not. I won't know anything until tomorrow at the earliest. Until then I get to spend the night questioning my decisions and wondering . . . 

Again, just wanted some of you to hear the experience of a non-user tasked with attending to an OD with no previous experience. And again, it is terrifying . . . and unfair, both to myself as well as the user. Fuck this goddamn scourge. Thank you for your time and be safe out there. ",1530414192.0

(My embarrasingly profitable winter of 2016) LONGREAD part 1,"Some of you guys may remember reading the story of my $32,000 scum up. (check my post history) If I had even a fraction of the writing talent of some other members of this sub, I would share some of my stories way more often, because this type of stuff is the reason I love this sub. I feel like the only way I can properly tell the story is in its entirety. So this will definitely get pretty long, so settle in for a long one. (I'm on mobile and tried mybest to format properly)

I don't act like such a piece of shit crumb anymore because I am now on suboxone maintenance. I highly recommend it to hopeless chronic relapsers such as myself. I'm actually a productive member of society now for the first time ever. So I don't scam/rob people anymore. I also feel like it's important to note that karma caught up to me BIG TIME and I definitely paid for all my scumbaggery that you're about to hear. Anyways, onto the story.

November 2016, 5am. I was supposed to see my PO at 8am, but I knew I would fail my urine test. Instead of trying to get into treatment or beg my PO for mercy, I decided to abscond. This meant I would have a warrant for my arrest and eventually I would have to go to jail, but I figured I'd make it through the winter before that happened, and I wanted to keep getting high

So at 5am I head to the city to grab some dope and forget about the consequences that were eventually coming my way. I had just gotten paid so I grabbed two bundles and some powder. While I was looking for a secluded spot to park and get high, my friend D called me on messenger and invited me to his uncle's house. He sent me the address and it was about five minutes from the hood I had just grabbed in. So I decided to go.

D has always been the biggest junkie I've ever met and at this point in time he had no job (he never has a job lol) and a seriously viscous habit. Since he was so close I figured I would go there to enjoy my drugs in relative safety and be JJ for D. I figured he was probably sick af if he is calling me at five a.m to see if I'm in the city. I had never met D's uncle or been to the house but I assumed I would be sneaking in and hiding our drug use. I couldn't have been more wrong. The scene I walked into at Owens house was really bizarre. I see three guys sitting around a table. D, Owen, and Owens friend Mac. It's a typical rowhouse, but this one is a duplex. Owen owned both, the first floor and basement is a  1 bdrm apartment where  Owen lived, and the second floor was a  1 bdrm apartment where  Owen used to have tenants but was now abandoned, and not really liveable anymore. It wasn't immediately clear that this was a full on drug house, but when D and Mac moved in, that's what they turned it into. These three guys were all sitting around the table, stuck, with a shit load of crack and paraphernalia. D explained that they had been up all night smoking crack and they would appreciate it if I could sell them a bundle so they could come down nicely off of all the hard they smoked. I hadn't smoked hard before, but that was about to change

When D pulled out a wad of money, I was shocked. This kid never has money, and any drugs he gets, is done immediately. He tells me between the three of them they cleared almost $600 that night!! I didn't really believe him, so I asked them to bring me into the scheme. Once he did, I didn't return home for six more months lol.

Everyone on r/opiates is familiar with whisper scammers. And most people in America are familiar with catfishing. D was basically combining the two. He had set up multiple accounts on the app ""MeetMe"" with pictures of his ex girlfriends. Since they were exes from before D was a junkie felon POS These girls were all pretty hot. A little too hot IMHO, but since he knew these girls and dated them before, he had pictures that weren't on the internet anywhere. The catfish profiles he set up where really elaborate and well done. They were all at least over a month old. 

He opened up the app to show me how it worked, and as soon as he did there were literally HUNDREDS of thirsty dudes hitting ""Gia"" up. It was really eye opening to see what girls have to deal with in their DMs. New messages (and tons of dick pics Lmao) came in CONSTANTLY. a legitimately overwhelming number of messages that would be impossible to keep up with. He narrowed it down by looking for people that were close to our city, that had a car, and that responded positively when we asked if they got high. Starting with weed and eventually asking about percs and Molly. A ton of dudes fit that criteria, and the majority of them were complete fuckboys who's opening line was something like ""Damn bb you so fine, I wanna spoil you and splurge on you, I'll treat you right I'm a good dude."" (FUCKING LOL) seriously guys, it was comical how cringey/desperate and cliche 98% of these dudes were.... I digress....

D, Owen and Mac were all working separate profiles. The first goal was to get guys to come over to ""smoke, Netflix&Chill, and see what happens"". With an agreement that they would buy or split some weed/molly/percs from ""Gia's"" ""neighbor"". We would either give a random address close by, or give the address for the abandon apartment upstairs. Getting guys to agree to this wasn't as hard as you may think. I was convinced that nobody was dumb enough to fall for it, especially with how common the phrase ""catfishing"" had become, but honestly the hardest part was just pretending to be a flirty interested girl and not coming across desperate for money or shady. But even if the guys noticed some red flags, a ton of them ignored it! The scam could go a few different ways depending on how the conversation went, sometimes it was sex for money, sometimes it was having them buy drugs from us, or even them trading their weed or pills for our weed or pills. 

It's really important to point out right here that we didn't actually have any real drugs! We used the age old oregano and bayleaves for weed. A glued piece if folded paper for dabs. And some random heart pills for percs or opana. Random supplement capsules for Molly's. Since meetme is ostensibly a dating or friend finding app, a solid percentage of our possible victims weren't very educated when it comes to drugs, and if they were, we were able to tell during the convo and change the scam accordingly.

So in no time at all, D has a guy on his way over to get high and chill with Gia. (At fucking 8am no less! God Damn are guys thirsty and desperate!) When the guy gets to the address we provided, D hands the phone off to Owen. Grabs 4 mollies and 5 ""dubs"" of the fake weed. And runs out to meet the poor bastard who fell into the trap. Owen texts the dude and stalls him, saying he is putting the dogs away, or putting her hair up. Whatever. didnnt matter, he just needed to buy a couple of minutes. Then once D gets to the house, he explains he's the neighbor coming to sell gia her drugs, but he's late for work. He tells the guy that gia's door is around back. This whole time Owen is texting the guy saying the same thing. This puts the victim at ease because D clearly isn't the one texting him.... because he's right in front of him. This makes him believe the girl is actually real. HA! They had it down to a fucking science. D then returns to the house with $200 dollars. I was floored. There's no way people are this stupid! There's now way it can be this easy! If he really just made $200 this early in the morning, imagine a Friday night! Right then and there I was all in. I figured I could make some serious money with my natural born bullshitting and this new scam. The next six months were absolutely insane. And if I didn't witness it first-hand, I wouldn't.believe this.scam.actually worked. But it did. It worked insanely well, the money started really rolling in. The meetme scam became all of our full-time jobs.

So I’m at a stage where my double life is starting to intertwine too much, and I feel impending doom. We do know what they say about all good things! Even if they’re fake and temporary “good things.”

I convinced everyone a few years ago I was clean. Even my boyfriend (recovering poly abuser) who I’ve lived with for 2 years (loved for many) still has no idea I am always high. He’s been using on weekends with me since dealing with a couple deaths, and he’s starting to feel some withdrawal on mondays. He deserves better than this. I deserve better than this. We have both come so far, and I feel like we are pushing shit to the absolute limit. If our families found out...ugh, devastating.

I don’t want to lose everything to this drug. I know I’ve been lucky for this long, but I’m almost out of it. We are in the market for a house, just got approved for a loan...I feel like we cannot purchase a house while active addiction. It’s just time to fucking stop. We have nothing to show for the money we do have. 


So now we are asking each other. “How” do we stop? That’s the hard part! 

I’m sorry if this is all over the place. I did smoke more weed than I’m used to smoking so yea I’m probably rambling but if you made it through thanks for reading!

this after he tried to invalidate my previous comment by going through my history and saying something like ""this coming from a guy who talks about IM'ing heroin.""

fucking whatever. that sub sucks now anyway since you can't talk about a long list of random shit after the rule change a few months ago or whatever.

anyway, how's everybody's weekend going so far? I'm sitting good for now. I went to pick up yesterday morning and when I got there she wasn't answering her phone or texts or anything. I even went and knocked on her door like she told me to do in that situation and no answer. so I went and sat at a grocery store around the corner and proceeded to blow her the fuck up while listening to NPR and fucking around on reddit. I told myself I'd give her an hour before I gave up and left. any other day I would have stayed as long as it took because she's normally reliable as fuck and I knew that she'd eventually wake the fuck up and serve me... but before I left the house I agreed to bring home some BBQ for the fam for lunch around noon.

I got there at like 10:30 and by the time 11:15 rolls around I've called her a total of 32 times. my dad had just texted asking if I'd be home soon, so I told myself I'd call one more time and if she didn't answer on the 33rd time I would just leave and maybe come back later, which would have fucking sucked because it's a 45 minute drive there and back. I put the car in reverse and snapped on the seat belt as the phone started ringing, already anticipating that goddamn ""this is the voicemail box of..."" but after 4 rings she fucking answers the phone.

she's all, ""...hellloooo?"" super fucking sleepy and shit.

""yooo, dude, what the fuck. you ok?""

""I fell asleep... what time is it? 11:15... oh fuck.""

""yeah dude, I'm around the corner at the grocery store. can I come thru?""

""yeah im, how long have you been here? I'm so sorry""

""shit like an hour. I'll be there in 2 minutes.""

""alright, yeah. cool.""

jesus fucking christ, perfect timing. I mean not really perfect timing since I had to like 45 min. but at least I wasn't going home empty handed. there's literally nothing worse than going home empty handed after a 45 minute drive. well I guess you could get pistol whipped and robbed or something, and that'd be worse. but I make it a point not to have to go to the ghetto to cop. my connects are usually in fairly nice areas that were recently gentrified. it helps living in one of the biggest cities in the country though.

anyway long story still pretty fucking long, she hooked me up with an extra like .4 or something for the inconvenience. definitely worth the wait for that. it's cool though I wasn't mad, she's a super fucking reliable and honest connect and this kind of shit almost never happens with her so I can definitely forgive the two times a month that I have to wait more than 10 minutes.

so I went on my merry way and picked up a fat order of bbq for the family before going home and munching down.

that's my weekend copping experience. let's hear some more. it's saturday afternoon, y'all have to have done some copping by now.",1530380412.0

Please help!,"Okay, so I have been smoking about half a gram to a full gram of heroin a day for only 2 months, I've waited the 24 hours and took a quarter strip of my 8mg/2mg suboxone strip. An hour later I took another quarter, then another hour later took another quarter of it. I've been off heroin for about 33 hours now, and I was definitely sick when I took the first dose. It forsure didnt make me feel worse, and definitely a little bit better, so I know I didnt go into precipitated withdrawal (As I have before, and it was a nightmare). But im just wondering if its safe to take more suboxone? Maybe a full strip? Maybe I just didnt take enough? I'm not sure and would really like some help here. It's been 3 hours since I took the last quarter strip, and I'm reading you can take more after 2 hours if your not feeling better but would really like some experienced advice.

A few years ago I tried opiates for the first time and have done it maybe 10 times since then. I've only really tried Tramadol which gives me an incredibly feeling for an entire day (for whatever reason, IR and ER seems to not matter in regards to duration; only in regards to when it kicks in).

Anyhow, I am supposed to be having a great time tonight with a very close friend of mine. I was unable to get us our usual opiate since he was out of stock, but that didn't keep him from offering me something else; oxycodone.

More specifically, it's Reltebon Oxycodone 10 mg ER.

Now, I've done a fair bit of research on it and it seems as if Reltebon Oxycodone is one of the worse brands in regards to this, because you can't break the ER by crushing them. Furthermore, I've heard some reports of these pills just being inferior to any other pills of the same type.

Regardless, I've got them and I've got 10 of them and I plan to use them. However, this is (was) my first time, but after reading up on it, I decided to give it a spin yesterday with 2 x 10 mg's of these in the morning.

Compared to Tramadol, this was very underwhelming. I didn't feel any euphoria - I was just feeling a little nauseated and very much annoyed at everything around me. I felt my neck being a little tigther than usual and I got a very very minor headache.

I'm a relatively big dude and when I use Tramadol, I need 300-400 mgs to feel really good. 

I've heard Oxycodone is supposed to be so much superior, but it just didn't feel like it to me. 

So, the question here is really; how am I gonna approach this tonight if I want to get a good kick out of it? If I take 4 x 10 mg of these - will I be having a good time once it kicks in? Is it true that I can't crush them and turn them into IR? 

As a site note, I got my hands on some Codeine pills with 25 mg in them. I've never tried them either, so I went ahead and popped 2 x 25 mg 4 hours ago to see if my body could handle them (I was told this was a good idea before experimenting with them), so I have this option available to me as well.

IV drug use- heroin,"So I got out of rehab in March and I’ve been shooting up pretty much ever since. I smoked it the first couple of weeks but then switched to the needle. 

I’m finally at the point where most of my veins are no longer visible. Used up everything on my hands and feet. When I take a hot shower or exercise sometimes some unused ones pop out but most of them are in hard spots to get a good angle. Like on the side by the elbow where it’s hard to put the needle in and see the angle. 

What do y’all do at this point? I’ve heard a lot of people say it takes a year to ruin all their veins. I know if I took a couple of weeks off they would come back but that’s hard to do at this point seeing how addicted I am. 

It’s so frustrating and I actually missed 3 shifts at work last week Bc I couldn’t hit in time and I didn’t wanna go into work dope sick. I started at 12 one day, left the house at 11 and didn’t get a hit until like 1:45. Seriously almost 3 hours of poking myself trying to get in a vein. 

Any suggestions on how to find hidden veins, how to bring veins back or anything else like that? 

Please help!!! And I know the best solution is to quit heroin but that’s not happening tonight or tomorrow and I need to be able to hit. I’ve been calling around to rehabs so once I take care of some stuff at work I’ll be seeking treatment. Just need to figure something out until then.  ",1530354679.0

I went to the gas station today to pick up a couple packs of smokes. The line is so long, it goes from the cashier to the door. I take my place in line, but it was a weird line, people kinda scattered around. 

A large, red faced man was standing next to me, and I wasn’t sure if he had just walked up or if he had been hidden behind an aisle waiting, so I waved my hand, indicating he could get in front of me. 

He took that as an indication that I was his new friend. He started talking about his day, waving his hands and getting very close to me. I’d back up, he’d close the gap. I could smell alcohol on his breath, and a bottle of something was sticking out of his pocket. 

Now, I’m not a large girl. I’m maybe 5’2, 5’3 tops. Everyone else in the gas station was ignoring him, avoiding eye contact. I was standing there wishing I’d done the same. 

He kept reaching out to touch me, grab my shoulder, my hand, and I kept dodging him, but there was someone behind me and I couldn’t back up any more than I already had. 

Finally the line moved forward and when I went to step forward, I felt a hand on my arm. A man that literally looked like junkie Jesus stepped in front of me, using himself as a barrier between me and the drunk asshole. He had long, brown hair, and visible track marks along his arms and hands. 

He talked to the drunk guy, sidestepping and blocking him every time he tried to get back at me. 

Finally the drunk guy was able to pay for his smokes and left, and my junkie Jesus graciously let me ahead again to pay for my smokes and get the hell out of there.

He wanted us,me and my husband, to be his hook up with crystal but we declined because he has no self control. We smoked with him a few times but after 2 weeks we hooked him up with one of our hookups so we could get away from it and his lack of control. Hes been doing it for a year and has done it before he joined the military, he was in thenmilitary for 8 years. Anyways he ended up making friends with a guy that shoots heroin. About a month ago my other step brother had to go hunt him down because no one had heard from him for over 8 hours. He found him at a dope house so messed up and confused he couldn't even drive home. On fathers day my sil texted me telling me she found him passed out in the bed with a syringe next to him and 2 more in a drink bottle with a plastic baggie and a tanish brown substance. She tried multiple times to wake him but he would only open his eyes for a few seconds before they would roll back and he would be asleep again. I told her it was heroin. Our parents found out and confronted him. He denied everything and blamed me and my husband said we were doing it he wasn't. It caused a huge split in my family because my step mom refuses to admit that her son could be doing drugs again. A week ago a friend of mine text me and told me he had come threw the drive thru where she worked and he was so messed up they couldn't understand what he was trying to order. Hes ghosted me and has his wife believing the lies but my biggest concern is hes going to od, because hes doing crystal and H, and his ""friend"" will just leave him and not call for help. Having been an addict i know you can't help them unless they want it but my nephews and nieces deserve to have their father in their life and i don't want him to die.

This kid ripped me off and gave me a fake $100 bill that he owned me then ghosted me for months.  All of a sudden he texts me saying how sorry he is and he wants to make it up to me.  He comes and picks me up and we drive.

We went to go pick up and got some blk and .5g of blow.  We get high (he shoots up a speedball but I only smoked).  We are driving down the steet in a residential area when all of a sudden he puts his emergency lights on and says ""be right back"" and left the car without pulling over or closing his door.  I am sitting in his car for about 15min when all of a sudden two cops pull up.  I eventually found out that his dumb ass was trying to steal shit from someone's backyard and the homeowner caught him so he ran.  He left his wallet and phone in the car and ditched me.  

The cops search his car and then asked me if they can search my backpack. I said no. They asked why and I said because I have rights.  He searched it anyways and found my .3g of blk and a scale.  I get arrested.  The care was impounded.  I spend 3 days in jail before I get a PR bond and was released at 3am this morning.  I turn my phone on and found texts from a random number saying that I stole his car and  he was going to report me to the cops for stealing his car.  I really hope he does call the cops because he was felony warrant out for his arrest and he would get what he deserves.  First court appearance is July 13th.

TLDR: My ""friend"" tried to steal shit from backyard but homeowner caught him so he ran. He left me behind in his car with all the drugs.  The cops come and arrest me after illegally searching my backpack when I said no.",1530329519.0

if you are on mobile you might have to dl the app and manually search for the room, which is called everythingisstil. (one l) when you sign into the app there is a button in the lower right hand corner that you press and it gives you the option of manually entering a room name. that's what you're after.  

sorry for repeating these nightly but we opiate enthusiasts have the memory of a goldfish so people need nightly reminders. here you are.  

we were stripped from having mod privileges for violating terms of service or something so i have to use my private room apparently? it's the same except it has the youtube player and actual moderation. repeat, new room link, same old chat.   

for those who are unaware tc is a video chat platform that while not perfect, seems to work well for phones and browsers alike. this room is for hanging out, listening to music, and specifically harm reduction so no one has to use alone. it is unaffiliated with r/opiates and its moderators and has its own rules and etiquette. here are the revised and updated rules:  

1) don't do any sort of -isms, it's just not cool and i run a leftist room. your opinions are welcome but no personal attacks or nasty stuff about groups of people. if you want to be rude, get personal, there's plenty of stuff to say about people without going for low-hanging fruit.  

2) don't make obnoxious noises over the mic, or play music over the chat. the bitrate for the sound channel is like 4, everything sounds like crap unless it's played through the built-in youtube player.  

3) don't dox anyone or take pictures or record the chat, this is a place people come to feel comfortable doing various things and anything that violates privacy results in an instant ban.  

4) guests must pick a unique username. no lurking allowed because people stalk people and shit. aside from these, just don't be rude or a douche.  

also, if you don't like me, or the mods, or the room, or anything else, just don't comment and move on. please don't be a hot mess on here, they're doing a good job. ",1530327312.0

Today while carrying a washing machine down the stairs I lost grip and the whole thing fell down onto my foot, breaking my big toe.
I immediately went into the hospital and after seeing the x-ray image I was so shocked, I had to throw up.

Where there should have been a bone there was nothing but tiny little splinters left. That, combined with the nail that was pushed completely inside the flesh, cutting all the way through to the underside of the toe and the fact that it was squashed thin to about 1.5cm in height, hurt like hell.

I've never been in so much pain before and all they gave me was a script for 100mg Ketoprofen, for which I had to walk to the pharmacy myself.  
I did take it as prescibed but it didn't help whatsoever. I called the hospital and asked if I could get a stronger painkiller which they denied.

Now I've never taken an opiate in my life but I have a friend who's using heroin recreationally. I asked him if I could buy some off him and he came over and gave me .5g for free.  
It's heroin #3, a brown powder, and not very pure. It's propably not cut with fent as there hasn't been a single death because of fent in the whole year in the country I live.

He told me to snort 80-100mg which is about the dose he's usually taking (he uses very sporadically, about twice a month so tolerance shouldn't be a big factor here) but I want to get a second opinion on how much I should take so I'm asking you for advice.

I'm a 21 year old male about 185cm tall and weigh about 65kg. I have a precision scale able to weigh down to 3mg accurately.  
Now I don't want to get too high from this as I have some studying to do; Nothing really difficult but still.

- patient is put under general anaesthesia.
- while under general anaesthesia patient is given naltrexone which rapidly flushes out all opiates in the body
- The patient is aroused to extreme discomfort seems however they will find that they have skipped the withdrawal process.

**things i don’t know about it**
- I don’t know how much Anaesthesia  is given but since it is going to have to take at least three days of being on unconscious I can’t see how that is either remotely healthy or how that it is done 

- What drug is used?  (**edit PROPOFOL**) i remembered the name - i guess this is redosed for the duration.

- I have personally seen what happens when naltrexone is given to patient while there awake it essentially puts them in a state of instant withdrawal which includes instant diarrhoea vomiting and all of the symptoms —  while these will be skipped as the patient is unconscious,
 how will they deal with the unpredictability of diarrhoea which is frequent (maybe daily uses of imodium, 8-12mg, i m might have answered my own question) and urination — a  catheter will sort out the urination, something i would despise.

- **the extreme discomfort upon waking**.
when I read this I have the impression that the patient must wake and find themselves in the middle of detox and the last thing they remember was being NOT being in detox.
 if true and therefore the patient is extremely sick I wonder how they counteract this or whether the patient just has to endure it - or given medication to deal with it, maybe sedatives - however after being on propofol and sedatives we know kills, being literally how M. Jackson died ‘m

- when I was reading about it it said that it would only last two days meaning the patient would be out or unconscious under general anaesthesia for two days now in my experience I’m sure in your experience two days is absolutely nowhere near finishing a detox in fact the patient would wake up at probably the worst and most intense part of the withdrawal process.

to me even being forced into unconsciousness with Anastasia 48 hours is extreme and dangerous enough and to be put under general anaesthesia to skip withdrawal you would have to wake them up and stop the Anastasia on day four or five which I think from a medical standpoint would probably kill the patient you cannot be on propofol for that long

That’s The equivalent of having a five day or an operation that lasts way over 100 hours this method confuses me I’ve never heard of it I am completely understand how I could be banned and I’m not sure how it has even ever worked I watched a documentary on Channel 4 once where they did this without Anastasia but with just Benz hours on day three they gave them now tracks alone and it was just pure horror and the worst decision I’ve seen any medical professional make giving, somebody naltrexone loan only on day three just puts them into basically a state of instant withdrawal similar to precipitated withdrawal.

most of the patients hallucinated urinate hemselves shit themselves and Vomitted. All were in extreme pain and since they cannot give any opiates because that will ruin the cold turkey process all they did was apply more benzodiazepines and benzodiazepines do nothing other than help insomnia during opiates dtox.

conclusion: I came across this method while looking for the different remedies for getting over withdrawal obviously there are only three different methods known to man basically there is methadone there is Subutex and there is this recently I’ve heard people talking of Creighton a lot and hope it works very well however in my opinion it just seems like another form of methadone or another subutex situation aka opiate substitution.

I am sure you’re well aware but if you’re not basically although Subutex and methadone both completely remove withdrawal symptoms if you happen to stay on either of these drugs for more than 3 to 4 weeks you become completely addicted to them in the same way that you become addicted to any other obvious and guess what ironically the withdrawal process for both of these drugs is much more harsh on her when itself lasts longer and c-an bemore intense.

before I go back to my Subutex which I found works even at the 4 mg level I have two questions

1) if you take high doses of Subutex even with the tolerance is there really euphoria to be gotten from  it.I’ve only ever taken 4-6 mg she is low dosage because that’s all i ever need, that’s enough for any dope head, doses beyond 14mg are useless - that’s the ceiling.

2) my other question is about kratom - 

 I already have my scepticism about it because I know that it’s just a plant with opioid activity which as far as I am concerned it is just Vicodin or codeine in plant form.... if it activates the opioid receptors then if use consecutively and long enough addiction will ensue. 

3) So I guess I’m asking why has anybody ever needed to be on methadone Subutex for months or even years at a time?  the only reason I can think of is that the drugs  have the ability to stop craving drugs mentally - as well as stopping symptoms physically. 

maybe these people were using the drug to stop the cravings a.k.a. using these drugs not only for physical needs but also to battle the mental addiction that follows physical detox because we all know that the mental addiction is probably harder than the physical addictin￼.


Sorry it’s long if y want just choose to answer the only aspects you’ve had exp with. i know nobody has experienced the first method - even to

so, a few things

1.) do you need a decent coffe filter? how much paracetamol is it safe to leave in the water without fucking my day up?

2.)im not an addict anymore,(well, still taking meth)  but would this get rid of heroin cravings for my friends? they always turn up asking me to score, saying there dope sick.

3.) anyone know how much codeine is lost? what would be a safe amount to put in? would just 1 pack be enough to get me floaty?

Turns out they did. They only sell them as singles and the smallest guage they have are 23guage, but trust me, it made it a lot easier to register. It could take up to 9 pokes before I would register and a lot of the times it would come out of the vein. So thats an added bonus on using a bigger guage, it registers a lot easier, so easy in fact that I got that shot in on the first try. Not to mention, you only need 1 rig for a large shot because one 3cc/ml syringe equals 3 of the normal rigs that we use to shoot up. 

TL;DR if you are finding that you are using more than one syringe to get your fix, get a bigger syringe such as a 3cc (aka 3ml) syringe. The bigger guage needle also makes it easier to register.",1530307085.0

And she knows I’m a recovering addict.,"My mom is a tour guide director for a large company.  She recently when to China and sent me a package while there.  My wife got it and asked “what the hell is this”(writing is all in Chinese).  I looked at these tiny little ampules of something liquidy.  And the top had to be punctured with a needle.  So I did that and smelled it.  Holy shit my mother unknowingly just shipped me 16 ampules of opium.  I told my wife it was a dietary bees wax supplement.  Tonight I’m going to indulge!   It’s funny because my mother is the reason I’ve been mostly clean for the last three years.  She put me in rehab after I went insane from withdrawing from opana, Xanax, and adderall all in a week.  

How do I know it’s opium?  This story is actually better than the above.  

My family lives in the south, and we have a “mountain house” where my fathers side lived since the late 1700s.  In the blue ridge mountains.  My grandma when my sister and I were about 5 and 7, would make us stay up there with her every summer.  So my grandma would always tell us “alright let’s go get my medicine”.   So we would go to this giant poppy field near the house and collect all the pods and stems.  Slash them.  Then the next day we would take all the dried stuff and roll into a ball.  This is what my grandma called “her medicine”, along with moonshine which she made outback the house.  It wasn’t until years later I realized while watching drugs Inc that my beloved grandma was making my sister and I felons by making opium!  

I’m 30 now, and grandma died at 95 a few years ago.  But I guess she started it all!

I’ll report back and let you guys know how it is.  ",1530306417.0

On the drive we were talking and she said she was at the place doing drug classes and I asked what her DOC is and she said she smokes heroin and I said, “that is so funny, I have some foils stuff on it under my seat as we speak!”. I told her my sub stuff sucks, the stuff I got from Chino earlier that day I’m pretty sure it was fake, tasted like barbecue sauce and was really weak. And he texted me after I left the meeting spot telling me to be careful that it was so strong and good (and you know whenever the D-boy starts telling you how good it is it’s either going to be fake or short 😂).  So she breaks me up a couple little pieces of hers and it was pretty dang good, I stopped and got $10 cash back and she gave me a point for the trip home. I asked her if she had any connects on the east side and she said that hers was on X & X streets...a half mile from my house!!!!

I lost track of an hour standing in the bathroom...,"Well first of all I wasn't sure if I wanted to finish all of my dope so I could start on subs 12 hours after my last use or when I started feeling funky. If my goal was to finish it, the goal was feasible around 3am but once I got past 4AM it became less reasonable. It meant that I'd have to wait until I was already at work before I could consider taking any sub.


Sometimes after a long bingy day I wake up feeling like I'm carrying training weights. Anyway, I didn't sleep the night before so now although I thought I was awake, I kept nodding off, dozing off and nodding I suppose. Before I knew it, 4:00am is 5:15am. 

Now, I go to the bathroom and am having trouble peeing. It's like when you're in a public restroom and can't push it out except I'm in my own bathroom and nobody is waiting behind me, nor i anyone trying to make small talk while I hold my dick. 


&nbsp;


I get up, I kept nodding off and getting wobbly. I kept walking up as I was making a controlled lean-stumble into the wall. Tripped over my toilet a couple of times. Still, straightened up... stood in the ""I'm peeing"" posture and still waiting. After the cycle repeats -- a combination of sleeplessness and dopiness, I realize that there was a signifigant time jump.  
 
I entered the bathroom at around 5:25 or 5:30am. Now, after what I perceive to be approximately ten minutes, I ovbserve the time is 6:25am. Holy shit, I lost an hour?! So I continue to stand, stumbling periodically -- losing track of five to twenty minute long swaths of time. Finally I get my bearings somewhere [just?] after 6:52am and I finally expel urine.

A few months goes by and he hits me up again, saying he's got new people and needs the same finders fee. ""Fool me once"" is in the back of my mind, but he did give me legitimate numbers the first time, so I do it again. Same thing happens. Chat with a few people and it patters out.

Fast forward to today, and he hits me up again. Obviously I tell him that I'm a bit miffed and need to get a solid source before I pay him his damn finders fee. He goes through the apology tour and talks up how he's got great connections now.

It was sweaty and miserable and sleepless.  A slight pocking of my skin had started in California, but now it was taking a turn for the worse.  It started on my arm where the witch bit me, and I swore it was a curse he put on me.  The rash itched and robbed me of sleep. It tortured me. It broke my already feeble mind. My legs and ankles visibly swelled, and three different doctors had no answer. What I determined to be a secondary staph infection created crusty lesions on my thighs that broke and wept when I lifted anything heavy. A round of sulfa-based antibiotics gave me some relief, but even if the rash wasn’t there to plague my life, there were other things breaking me inside.






The abrupt discontinuation of my daily heroin regimen made me feel everything my body was doing. My bones’ hard surfaces cut into my aching muscles, pulling and twisting every ligament. Instead of a spine with vertebrae, I had a stack of wooden Jenga blocks ready to fall. My guts gurgled when I swallowed my saliva. I imagined my brain’s synaptic firings discharged heat through my ears and caused a dull aching in my eyeballs. It was as if life had become an electrically charged fence into which I was slowly being pushed. 

My feet shuffled across the floor in the daytime. Articles of clothing I collected from the streets covered Carlos’s back room in truly psychotic fashion. I spilled rolling tobacco all over his house and crept around the kitchen at night. His cupboard’s hinges creaked while his family slept. Solidified chunks from an ancient can of Ensure stuck between my teeth, and I gagged. It was my fault for compulsively looting his dry goods cabinet and eating whatever I found in the dark.

''Exposure of rats to morphine for 7 days resulted in marked naloxone-induced withdrawal symptoms and agmatine treatment along with morphine significantly decreasing the withdrawal symptoms''

''We conclude that agmatine reduces the development of dependence to morphine and that this effect is probably mediated by the inhibition of cAMP signaling pathway during chronic morphine exposure''

Need input on what to do.","I have been on 16mg Suboxone/day for around 6 months now, I take it as prescribed. Didn't use any opiate the entire 6 months besides my subs. I've been doing treatment the entire time as well. On Monday from about 9pm-11pm I relapsed on about 80mg IV black tar heroin. I waited 36 hours, then took my suboxone again. I am about 90% sure I am going to get drug tested tomorrow, and it may or may not affect legal issues I have. My drug test will take place about 80 hours from my last IV heroin use. It is a laboratory GC/MS urine drug screening.

What are my chances of passing this test clean tomorrow morning? I go to treatment at 10am and they do random drug testing, but it's been a while since Ive been tested and I had to skip today to go to court. So I'm sure that will make them want to drug test me.

I have three options, I have cleen pee from about 4 days ago that I froze. I could thaw it out, warm it up, and fake the test. But they might notice that it's older urine. I've faked many drug tests before but this place is quite professional.

My second option is just to call in right now and leave a message letting them know I relapsed. If I know I'm going to get caught, this will be a good way to minimize consequences and hopefully I'm not kicked out of the program since I was honest.

Third option is just to go in and take the test, hoping I pass. Is ~80 hours after IVing about a point of heroin enough time to pass a lab drug screen?",1530247580.0

So, I'm scrolling through Whisper, just bullshitting, laughing at all the desperate posts of people that are craving any sort of sexual encounter. So, while I am doing that, I come across an opiate related post of someone basically saying they have Tar on deck. So, of course me being an addict, I immediately message em. ""Hey, What side of town are you on?"", and not even 5 minutes later, they reply. So, we end up going back and forth for about a day, before I finally end up getting off work, and am driving to meet this guy. He's about 15 minutes from where I am, ""Hell yeah"" is what im thinking. Dude seems legit, even said he would hook me up with a free sack of some other shit he had. ""Nice!"", Finally JJ has blessed me. So, When I get to where we ended up meeting, He doesn't want to meet at my car, cuz he says, ""A sting can happen outside and after this first transaction, then we can meet up where ever"", okay?? Whatever man, I'll come meet you inside. Keep in mind, we are in a VERY public building, with cameras everywhere, security, and also, just an all around crowded place. 

So, we walk to the bathroom and he hands me the so called ""Half""(.5 G), which is in a balloon(Normal packaging around here), before I ever hand him any money, I walk into the bathroom, go to a stall, close the door, and get to opening this balloon. As I'm opening the balloon, I hear someone get into the stall next to mine, say ""Shit"" under his breath, and then walk out. Didn't think anything of it, while im still trying to find the middle of this balloon and foil combination. I eventually get to the middle, which is still just foil, and find nothing in this balloon. So, I get ready to confront this dude, and when I walk out the bathroom, he's no where to be found. So at THIS point, i'm thinking this was a set up to get me arrested, so as soon as I saw that window, I DIPPED the fuck out of there. Damn near ran to my car, and high tailed away from the spot. 

So, here is the good part of this whole situation, I end up calling another friend of mine, to help me out. So I drive over to them, pick em up, and go to meet their dude. Dude comes through, and ends up introducing their dealer to me. SICK! Just as I wanted from the beginning, and the sack is 10/10 on the dope scale. So, All in all, I didn't lose anything, and ended up gaining an awesome dealer. I can tell you this, I will never use Whisper again. 

TLDR: Met a ""Dealer"" off of Whisper, ended up trying to scam me, I didn't give him any money. Got paranoid and dipped tf outta there. Called homie, homie introduced me to their dude, got new connect. ",1530246958.0

I’ve felt blessed by my dealers giving me free dope but still,,, that’s not JJ in my mind. 

Anyway, my boyfriend and I are on our way to meet our dealer and we stop at a gas station a few blocks away to get some cash. I sent my boyfriend inside to get the money and as I’m sitting in the car I decide to take a few things to the trash. I step out of the truck and see this small baggie laying on the ground with what looks like some unused cottons inside of it. I quickly pick it up and pocket it before anyone sees me dropping drug paraphernalia everywhere, toss a few things in the trash, and get back in the truck. I remember the baggie, wondering how I managed to drop my cottons outside since I remember putting away my works. As I pull it out of my pocket I realize these aren’t my cottons. I picked up a baggie of six blue A 215s that some poor dope fiend must have lost!

——

I am happy to report, all is well!  As I mentioned in an update in the other post, my boyfriend is super friendly with Junkie Jesus, and got a line on a kind of distant acquaintance of his who *also* is prescribed pinks.  My boyfriend called him and basically said “I know this is gonna sound weird but...” and gave him the whole story.

The guy was happy to come over and help us out by *lending* us his pills for the duration of the appointment!  Is that not the coolest move ever? Seriously, the way people look out for each other really warms my heart!  I sat and chatted with him throughout our neighbors visit, and I am so glad we got to meet. He’s a great guy, and we are glad to call him a friend now.

It turns out our Neighbor didn’t have to *go to* an appointment after all, but they actually had someone come out to the house to check on him!  Of course that means that he wouldn’t have been able to just not show up or stall, so that’s some interesting info that might be of use to someone.

Obviously I wasn’t there for the actual visit, but he said that the woman who came out was actually pretty nice.  As I mentioned before, he has never been in any trouble, so they had no reason to treat him as anything other than a cancer patient who needs his medication.

They knew when his prescription was last filled, and did ask to see his bottle. She wrote down some numbers from his label on to her form, which of course wasn’t a problem because he put the pills in his original bottle for the visit.  She shook the bottle and took the off the cap to look at them, but she didn’t actually pull them out and count them.  Our neighbor said that the fact that he had pills to show her gave him enough confidence that he never gave her any reason to doubt him, because he was never shifty or uncomfortable.  Maybe for that reason, a drug test never came up, even though it was mentioned in the phone call from what I hear.

He did ask her what the visit was all about, feigning genuine curiosity.  He said the whole visit was kind of a blur, so he’s not entirely sure exactly what she said, but her answer made it sound like she was there to check up on the pharmacy as opposed to checking up on him.

Anyway, as I said everything is perfect now.  Moving forward, we discussed with him that his next prescription he should hold onto, so that he always has them available for a situation like this if it comes up again.

I want to thank all of you for your advice and well wishes during this nail-biter of a situation.  It’s such a comfort to me that even “people like us” have a place to turn for advice when we need it. You guys are the best, and I’m glad I was able to come back with good news!",1530233866.0

A couple of weeks ago I picked up an eighth of some really good ECP. It was brown and powdery, but it felt as if it had been wetted. Little bits would clump together and it was soft, also kind of cold to the touch. I would describe it as fluffy.

Despite my initial reaction it actually ended up being really good and it was much more forgiving of my nose than most batches. It didn't irritate it as much and I wasn't dealing with the usual stuffiness I get after sniffing for a couple of days.

A day or so after getting it someone told me about how some dealers will use drops of vinegar for weight and smell to their product. I don't know if this is the case with what I had, or if this is even a common thing. However:

I was wondering earlier today, would it be possible to add a drop or two of water/vinegar/etc. and drying it out to make it fluffier, like the stuff I had a couple weeks ago?

[take a look at these ](https://imgur.com/a/hZYuohP)

so my friend heard knocking outback, she went to check it out and seen nothing. she also felt like someone was there. she started taking photos to use her flash to look around, which resulted in these pictures. she also lives directly in front of Corpsewood Manor, where devil worshipping and murders occurred. 

to me, the first pic looks like it’s starting to form. the second pic looks like apparitions. and the third pic I just circled what I see. 

Do u guys believe in ghosts/ spirits? Do you believe in the afterlife and paranormal? I’m a bit of a skeptic when it comes to God, and there can’t be a God without the Devil, so I guess I’m not sure if I believe in him either. I’m not sure what I believe in when it comes to a higher power, which might be why I have always failed in trying to 12 steps haha, but personally, I definitely do believe in spirits. although i’m not sure what happens after death. 

I’m interested in seeing what everyone thinks. Do you guys even see anything in those pics? If so, what do you see? someone mentioned seeing several children. and then some people say it’s just a camera smudge, or a reflection. but mind you, she wasn’t around any mirrors or windows and was aiming directly at a big open field. 

again - sorry if this is off topic but this is where i always post and read. the only forum really. i’m also interested in what my opiate friends think, because i think most of us opiate peeps have the capacity to think outside the box and be open minded, whereas more of the “normal” people can be pretty close minded, arrogant, and can’t think anything beyond life.

As u know all you do with prolonged OC is smash up the pill and the duration aspect is broken.

anyone know the real deal why over here we still get the OC? in fact thats all we get - i think i just might have realised - it’s because of the oxy boom in the usa right?

She has surgery yesterday for her endometriosis and when they opened her up she was completely filled with black, evil cancer.  The Dr's got as much as they could out but it has spread to her colon, bladder and anal area.  She's only 32.

So onto my question...

If you knew you were terminally ill, would you stay on your sobriety path or start using again?  She is a recovering pill and H addict and has been sober for several years now.  She does not want to take any opiates and wants to leave this earth as sober and clean as she can.  I'm so worried about her and her pain levels as it is but I have to respect her wishes.  She did receive IV pain meds after the surgery but is insisting that she isn't given any more.

For me, personally, I would take everything they offered me and just ride out my last days as high as I could get.

Pretty random me posting here as I don’t usually use Reddit except to read, although I felt the need to disclose what just happened to me.

I’ve been using opiates on and off for 10years, usually IV heroin or oxy. I had been clean a few months but just scored some weight of a nice china white, which I’ve been shooting for 4 days straight, it’s been great but my habit is totally hidden, so no one in my life knows or suspects

Anyway, today I was home alone and it was time for my morning shot, I’d dropped my GF to work and was setting up in my bedroom. I sat at my work desk, got out my gear, mixed up and prepped a normal size shot. Tied off and put it away... first 5 seconds I remember thinking ‘ahh you pussy, you coulda had  more’, next thing I know ... OUT. 

Now I’m looking at the ceiling and my eyes are flickering, my desk, lamp, computer, files, booms chair all smashed across half of my room and laying on top of me. My ears are ringing.  I run my hand over my head, exclaiming “what the fuuuck man”, to myself, there’s multiple  cuts in my forehead and running fingers further over my face there’s blood all over my hands. I pull myself up and check the mirror, there are cuts and a huge dark lump under my eye, where a computer or lamp might have landed on me and I have a slight bluish hue to my lips. I check my pulse which is weak but fast. 

Then I check my phone and calculate I’d been out for about 30minutes. I sit back and give thanks to God, the universe, whatever the big power is and start to clean up the mess. I pick up all my remaining fits and slam them against the wall, I’m never IV’ing again, I say to myself. Right now I KNOW I was close to death . Close to not being here, close to leaving my parents, partner and friends with my cold lifeless body. Leaving them with the knowledge I died a fucking junkie. 

I don’t think I’ll ever IV again, I’d put $10000 on it but the first thing I did after I got my desk back up, washed the blood off my face and prayed once more ... was to cut another line of heroin and snort it right up my fucking nose.

I’m not sure how to feel.

Stay safe guys and if you can shoot with company, at least that way you probably won’t cop a laptop to your forehead.

So here is the scoop, I haven't really been doing any opiates besides a few percs here and there once every 2 months or so. Years back I was snorting/eating up to 20 roxies a day, then they got expensive and I wasn't getting them for free anymore so moved onto H. Never been a shooter, tried it... didn't care for it as much but was a junkie none the less. Snorted that shit for about a year and quit a little over a year ago. Anyway, my buddy slipped me a fent patch  (100, the big boy) and im not sure how to use it safley...firstly my tolerance ain't shit and secondly I've only had a fent patch once and it was not the 100. I know there isn't a great way to measure it from a patch so what do I do?  Cut it into 8 strips and take one whenever I want to catch some nods?? Anyway, I don't want to die and fent seems to be real good at that so any info would be great! Thanks ",1530186371.0

My new roommates are basically never home because they work, and all of my friends are either still in college or with their families, so I'm constantly home alone.

With the anxiety of not having a job and the boredom of constantly being alone, I find myself trying to get my hands on any drug I can. Just found a coke plug, and he said he has access to basically anything, and instead of going to sleep I've been contemplating asking him for pills or even H.

I'm a 22 year old Egyptian guy who started snorting heroin a couple of months ago due to peer pressure (*smh ik*). I had only been smoking hash on a daily basis (we don't have weed here) and every once in a while I would do benzos & Tramadol, like on the weekends only, never really got addicted to them. I had always wanted to try heroin but never had the chance as none of my friends did heroin, and when I did get the chance, I chose not to do it, even though I really wanted to, but I just convinced myself (*and my bestfriend*) that it just wasn't a good idea. I was too scared of getting hooked.

A couple of months ago, one of my close friends started doing heroin and got hooked pretty fast. He only snorted it, though. Without going into too much detail, he managed to convince me and my bestfriend to try it, so we did. And of course, I **fell in love**.  We started doing it on the weekends only, then twice a week, and eventually (*you guessed it*) we were blowing a gram every other day. I knew I was falling into the so-called downward spiral of heroin, but I didn't care, I was having a good time and that's all that mattered, maybe the fact that I was going through depression (*bi guy in Middle Eastern society, go figure*) had something to do with it, but then again maybe I was just looking for an excuse to keep using.

My bestfriend, well, he wasn't as fond of the drug as I was. I mean, he liked it, but the withdrawals were a turnoff for him, unlike me who didn't mind some slight morning aches. Also, he had what you might call a rock solid head, so he couldn't really feel the high that I felt and so couldn't appreciate the drug the way I did. Anyway, he never really liked how things were going, and was always telling me that we should quit before things get out of hand, but I would just tell him that we're ""alright"" and that he's worrying too much. Talk about being a bad influence! *\*rolleyes\**

You know how an addict's first thoughts upon waking up are about how they're gonna score that day? Well, money wasn't the problem for me *(so far)*, it was convincing my BF to let me score for the night and not get mad at me and start giving me lectures about how I'm being stupid and whatnot. It might seem odd, but the thing is, we've **always** done everything together. We had the first cigarette together, the first joint, the first pill, the first **everything**. So when it came to drugs, going solo wasn't really an option, it kinda went without saying.

Anyway, summer arrived and I had to travel to Saudi Arabia to spend a month with my father who works there. Now, as we can all agree, Saudi Arabia is the **last** place on earth anyone would want to get caught with drugs in, especially with heroin. Plus, solo wasn't our thing, remember? This meant that we were set to take the ""break"" we had always planned on taking but never could. It also meant that we were in for a withdrawals treat that scared the shit out of us, since we'd never actually tried quitting for more than a couple of days.

In a situation like this, the smart thing to do is to try and taper off the drug during the remaining couple of weeks I had, right? Well, actually, we did the **opposite**. I took advantage of the situation and used it as an excuse to do heroin everyday. ""*This is it man! We know we'll be forced to take a break in a couple of weeks so why not go crazy and have the most fun we can have while we can?*"" That's what I told my BF, and boy he couldn't argue with **that**. He agreed, but he told me that when I'm back from Saudi, we have to quit, for good. *""No more of that shit""*. And I was like *""Sure man, I was going to suggest that, anyway""* But I knew I was just **flat out lying**. I knew this shit was too good to just simply *abandon* like that, but I just went along to avoid unnecessary quarrels.

# I just realized how long this post has gotten, so I'll just go ahead and try to cut it short.

I went to Saudi. The first 2 days were hell on earth. Cold turkey shit, you know the drill. But I pulled through, and by day 5, I was completely fine, good as new. It's been 2 weeks now. Boredom has been killing me. I miss my friends so much. But the thing that worries me the most, is that I miss heroin more than I've ever missed anything in my life. It's creepy. I've been fantasizing about doing heroin everyday since I got here. I've been getting dreams about snorting lines every single night, **every single night!!!** I've been watching movies about heroin. I've been researching about heroin (that's how I ended up posting this). It's haunting me, and I don't know what to do about it.

I'm supposed to get back to Egypt in 2 days. I promised my BF that I'll put this shit behind me and forget about it when I'm back. But I know that won't happen. I can see where this is going. It looks **bad**, really bad. I'm afraid I'm already screwed. If I'm going to be honest with myself, it seems like everything's already set in motion. I know I will get back to it as soon as I'm home and have the chance to go score.

I don't even know why I'm posting this. It's not like someone can actually convince me to just not do it. I just felt like I want to talk about it even though I know it's pointless and people won't even care. But I guess part of me actually wants to be talked out of this, somehow. or Maybe just wish me luck in keeping my habit in check or whatever. I honestly have no idea. But sharing this definitely makes me feel better.

I also don't know what kind of post this is supposed to be. It's not really an addict story (*too inexplicit?*), and it's definitely not a question. I just went ahead and started typing with no clear goal in mind, so now I feel like I wasted your time. So **sorry** about that. ^((And sorry for my lame English writing skills haha))

At the same time my boyfriend who is opiate naive took 10 mg and began feeling it HARD so its not the pills. I took a xanax bar, hydroxizine, 750 mg soma, and I believe doxylamine all in pursuit of a nod. By 2:30 am I was awake feeling nothing so I decided to give up and try to sleep. At 5 am I woke up with the definite nod and crazy itches, basically what  I wanted 6 hours earlier. I nodded on and off until about 11 am.

Obviously I know the high gets weaker the longer you use and I've heard about people forever chasing the feeling of the first time they shot up, but I'm pretty sure what I'm experiencing is different - heroin just makes me feel totally shit now. 

I don't get the slightest hint of mental or physical euphoria any more, it just makes me groggy, gives me a headache and puts me in a bad mood. It's been this way for a couple months now, and I've only being using for 2 years. 

I've bought from 5 different dealers from all over the UK so it's not that I've got particularly bad gear, it's definitely something that's changed within me. 

Has anyone else experienced this? Just a complete lack of any pleasurable effects from heroin?

My question though is to anyone who has successfully used subs to detox from opiates while simultaneously tapering your sub dose to get clean from all substances, how did you do it? What worked and what didn’t? 

I am not naive enough to think that all cases are different and that depending on what your habit is, that will in turn effect tapering regimens? But how did you do it? Any suggestions? How long is too long to build dependence on subs?

Before anyone suggests long term maintenance, at this point that is not an option, neither is methadone.

I have been seeing a lot about Kratom, can you take that while on subs? I mean I have all these subs so that is what I want to use, but I am a rookie when it comes to Kratom.

I sold 12 of the pins for $30. So I basically got free $5, 8 klonopin and a methadone 10.

8ufdwp,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8ufdwp/addiction_disease_or_choice/,17,https://redd.it/8ufdwp,LittleBigCheeks,Addiction: Disease or Choice?,"Ok, so I already know the answer to this question, but some people still tend to disagree on this, especially those who don't have much experience with addiction. I learned a little about this in rehab and thought it was interesting; I also came up with an analogy that helped me better understand it, so I thought I'd share! I'd like to hear your opinions as well.

So technically, addiction IS classified as a disease. I was taught in rehab that to qualify as a disease, the condition must meet 3 requirements:

1. It needs to be detrimental to one's life
2. It needs to have signs and symptoms
3. It needs to have a way to test for it with CONSISTENT results

So for instance, there's fibromyalgia. While at first its existence was doubted, it is pretty much unanimously accepted as a disease in the scientific/medical community, but it still isn't *technically* classified as one, because it doesn't meet condition #3; there is no *consistent* way to test for fibromyalgia.

Addiction, however, does meet all 3 requirements. It's clearly detrimental, there are signs and symptoms, and there is a consistent way to test it - a brain scan. Brain scans are always consistent in those who suffer with addiction; compared to a normal person's brain, those with addiction consistently have shrunken frontal lobes (which handles impulse control and decision making) and enlarged nucleus accumbens, or ""pleasure centers."" Now, people with addiction are **not** born with brains like this, but this is consistently how the brain looks after becoming addicted. So, in this way, addiction is a disease (I don't have an opinion/am not sure myself of whether or not people can be born with addiction or an ""addiction gene."" That's another conversation).

These effects of addiction on the brain are why some people don't understand why addicts can't ""just stop,"" or why even addicts themselves can say, ""I'm going to quit today. I'm serious,"" and then walk out the door to pick up minutes later. Their decision making has been severely compromised and overtaken by the pleasure center.

So, I learned all this in rehab. I still used to struggle with defining addiction as a ""disease"" because I felt it shifted the blame away from the addict. I never thought or wanted to think that ""It's not really my fault I can't control it, I have a disease."" However, I thought of an analogy that really helped me grasp it. 

Take type 2 diabetes for instance; it definitely qualifies as a disease. All this means is that it meets those 3 conditions, and it requires **outside** treatment to be managed. Sometimes, people can cause themselves to develop type 2 diabetes. A person can choose to eat poorly and not exercise their entire lives, and therefore develop the disease. A person *chooses* to make unhealthy lifestyle choices over and over again, and they may develop diabetes because of this, meaning they now have a disease that needs outside treatment.

This is how I see addiction. I do suffer from the disease of addiction, meaning my disease meets those requirements and I'm not always in complete control of my decisions anymore; my brain actively works against me. It also means that I need **outside treatment** if I ever hope to beat it. However, calling it a disease does not mean that it's **not** my fault. I *chose* to make unhealthy lifestyle choices; I *chose* to put something unhealthy into my body over and over again until I developed a disease I could no longer control or treat on my own. 

What do you guys think? Disease or choice? Feel free to disagree with me, I won't be upset! And sorry, I know I should probably link some sources, which I'm too lazy to do as I write this, but I will research and add sources later. Anyone, feel free to correct me if I got something wrong. I did learn this in rehab from a video of an expert professor in this field giving a lecture on the subject (I'm gonna text some friends from rehab to see if they remember the name of the professor or university he taught at), and it's common knowledge that addiction is *technically* classified as a disease. Some people just disagree, and that's fine. However, the analogy I thought up helps me accept the fact that I have a disease but am still to blame for causing it. I gave myself a disease with my poor choices. It was definitely a choice at first, but now I have to work against not always being in control of my choices and I need outside treatment to do so.

I’m going to try to make this as brief as possible, but it’s something I’ve wanted to share for a long time. And I want to start out by saying that I’m in NO way implying it’s IMPOSSIBLE to chip on heroin; I’m sure there are some recreational users out there. In fact, a statistic I see a lot is that 23% of people who try heroin end up addicted. That always seemed low to me, but I feel like that other 77% is mostly people who tried it once or twice and never again, rather than long-time recreational users. But, I’m sure it’s possible. So feel free to reply with your opinion that “I can totally chip, I’ve been doing it for X years so fuck off.” I just think that it’s very rare and very difficult to do, and I’ve been wanting to give my opinion on this for some time. It’s definitely not meant to be hostile or accusatory or anything, I just want to share my story!


So I sort of want to give my side of the argument on this issue. I think some people who start off chipping just don’t know that much about heroin and end up screwed. But, I feel like a lot more people who do chip or start off chipping are NOT stupid or misinformed; in fact, I think the majority are pretty smart and self-aware. 


This is what I think the typical chipper mindset is: “I know this is a very dangerous, addictive drug, and a lot of people have warned me you can only use recreationally for so long. But I’ve got this. I’m different. BECAUSE I know the risks involved, I can totally be on top of this. I will just use once a month/once a week/not more than 1 day in a row. I know that NO ONE ever thinks they will be a junkie; basically, everyone starts off chipping. But those people couldn’t control themselves, made the mistake of doing it too often, or were addicts to begin with and it was bound to happen. I’ve used x, y, and z drugs recreationally and NEVER been addicted. I’m smart.” 


Then people who had a similar mindset to begin with warn them: “Hey, I was smart too. No one starts off wanting to be a junkie, but not every junkie had an “addictive personality” beforehand and just couldn’t control themselves. A lot of junkies were smart, aware, capable people too. You’re playing with fire. It’s bound to happen.” And even so, the chipper thinks, “Sure, but that’s still not me. I’m way too smart. I’ve tried hard drugs before, maybe even painkillers. I got this.”


So, I think chippers who become addicts fall into 2 categories; category 1 is people who maybe did have issues with drugs before, aren’t too concerned with the risks/don’t know them, and it was pretty inevitable they would end up addicted, although no one thinks they’ll be a junkie at first. Category 2 is people who look at this first group and think they are different; they are smart, controlled, know the risks involved, and may not have an addictive personality, so they’re good. They scoff at the warning that “no one ever thinks they’ll be a junkie” because they *get it.* 


I really just want to share my story/warning with this second group of people. And again, I’m not saying it can’t be done. I just think it’s really close to impossible. 


This is already too long but I’ll try to make my story brief. There were many signs/things I experienced growing up that made me think, “I’ll never be an addict.” For one, my family had quite a few addicts in it. My mom has struggled with drug addiction her whole life, including a long battle with painkillers while I was a teenager. We don’t have a great relationship. She is pretty selfish, narcissistic, and acts like a teenager, even during periods of clean time, and she’s done some terrible things during her addiction. That’s a whole other story, but a big thing with me growing up was that “I’ll never end up like my mom.”  


The main thing though were my experiences and life leading up to my addiction. I really do not mean for this to sound conceited, but I would consider myself smart. I never had to crack open a book in high school and I graduated valedictorian with a 4.3 and earned myself a free ride to college. I graduated college with a 4.0 and an English teaching degree, and got hired as a teacher immediately after graduating. And I did all this while using quite a few drugs recreationally. I smoked weed everyday in high school and was still valedictorian. Also in high school, I tried Adderall, Xanax, various painkillers, ecstasy, acid, and mushrooms. After high school I had also tried cocaine. Throughout high school and college, I used these drugs more than once, but my use never got out of control. I was essentially able to party on the weekends and not use drugs during the week, except for smoking weed. All of this, along with my mom, gave me the notion that I was very in control of my drug use and would never end up addicted to anything. I mean, Xanax, painkillers, and cocaine are addictive, right? But I was able to use them once in a while with NO cravings whatsoever. 


So now I’m 21, in my junior year of college. My cousin, who was my best friend since we were 5 years old, was addicted to heroin. She struggled with drug addiction since she was 17; she was addicted to pretty much whatever she could get her hands on. This changed her drastically and she had stolen from me, broken into my house, had various problems with the law, etc. It pretty much ruined our friendship, but again, that’s a story for another time. It was just another instance of “I’ll never be like that.” This is important, though, because this was my first opportunity to try heroin. One day I was at her house and I knew she had taken money from my wallet. She passed out in bed and I took one bag of heroin from her, out of curiosity. 


I actually kept that bag for a few months before even trying it. I had been dating my boyfriend at this time for about 2 years. He also had a best friend who had been a raging junkie since high school, and he had actually tried heroin before; his friend had shot him up maybe 8-10 times throughout high school. And he never got addicted to heroin! He didn’t even really like it that much because it just made him pass out. Finally, a few months after acquiring the bag, me and my boyfriend split it and snorted it. And of course, it was pretty awesome, but I didn’t think it was anything “crazy” amazing. I had my hesitations before trying it, knowing it was the most dangerous drug I would ever try. I wasn’t even really smoking weed anymore at the time; just taking some Xanax once in a blue moon, doing great in college. After realizing the next day after trying it that I wasn’t suddenly addicted, I was pretty positive that like all other drugs I had tried, heroin wasn’t going to be a problem. We didn’t even have cravings the next day. 


But hey, it was fun, right? A month later I took my cousin and her boyfriend up to their dealer to get some more. 3 bags for $25? That’s pretty cheap! And with our extremely low tolerances and “non-addictive personalities,” those 3 bags lasted me and my boyfriend a long time, spread out, never more than a day in a row. It just became part of a pattern of our regular recreational drug use that had no real bad effects on our lives. I had a full scholarship to college, I was going to be a teacher; there was no way I’d end up a junkie! Sure, no one ever thinks they will, but we were smarter than those people, of course. 


Fast forward a little while. My boyfriend and I chipped for about 8 months with no real consequences. Always snorting as well; I knew better than to touch a needle. I don’t even remember when it happened. I can’t pinpoint the week when we used too many times in a row. And this is where some of you chippers think, “See? They ended up using too much. Not me. Never two or more days in a row.” But I’m telling you, we KNEW better. I was so successful and in control of my life. But it just sneaks up on you. Eventually there came a time where we’d wake up after using the day before and just be cranky with each other. We didn’t know why. We’d just be angry and fight over nothing, until some point in the day when one of us would justify using again that day and everything would change. 


When we first experienced withdrawals, we didn’t even know what it was. We went out of town for 3 days and just thought we had the flu. And I was SO depressed, and I didn’t know why. Crying for no reason. When we came back, we did some research and just knew, it was too late. This was now addiction. We got more dope that day and from that point on, we were junkies. I’m 24 now, going to be 25 in October, and I’ve struggled with this addiction, using daily, for about 3.5 years. There’s been little bits of clean time in there.


The first year or two of our addiction, we were both working and it was easy to manage. But eventually, disaster comes. I quit my job to student teach and my boyfriend’s part time job (he was in school too) wasn’t enough to cover our habit, so I went through my savings. I graduated college with a 4.0 and landed a job teaching high school English as a FULL BLOWN JUNKIE. I was somehow able to still be successful, but it hurt my boyfriend more. He lost his job and ended up dropping out of school and looking for full-time work. Then came the time when my teaching salary wouldn’t even cover our habit; there would be a few days in between paychecks. This is how I got into debt. 


I thought this was my rock bottom. We were still only snorting; to this day, I still just snort my bags daily, I’ve never used a needle. This is how I was able to teach and hide my addiction from my family. I appeared so successful to everyone else. But I thought this was my bottom; coming home every day from teaching kids, locking myself in my room with my boyfriend to do dope all day, spending all of our money on dope. Now, I did NOT think I was better than any other addict out there; I just thought, all rock bottoms are different. Because of my education and background, this was mine. Not every addict ends up a homeless criminal. This is as bad as it gets, and I hated it. I was miserable. We tried many, many times to quit on our own, both with cold turkey and with suboxone (illicitly obtained) and always failed. For some reason, rehab wasn’t an option for me at that point. I was not in denial at all, I knew I was an addict, but I felt I couldn’t reveal the truth to my family or job or get time off school. 


Fast forward a bit more. Finally, after 3.5 years of daily use, shit hit the fan. I was arrested for drug possession and had to resign from teaching. My family now knew. I did 40 days in rehab and ended up relapsing afterwards. To this day, I’m still struggling with addiction. My boyfriend and I no longer live together; he moved back in with his mom, and we still talk, but we need to be separate to get clean. Although it’s not going too well for either one of us. I’m trying to look for a full-time job with my English degree, a receptionist or something, that I can do in the meantime until my court case is done. I was charged with a level 6 felony that will be reduced to a misdemeanor with probation. I will be able to get my teaching license back, but probably won’t be able to teach again until I’m able to expunge the misdemeanor from my record.


This was NOT supposed to be my life. I was valedictorian, with a full scholarship, smart, ambitious, capable, financially responsible. I can’t believe how far I’ve fallen. And I still haven’t been able to completely beat this. While in rehab, I met lawyers, firefighters, veterans, ER nurses, other teachers, etc. Addiction does NOT discriminate. 


There’s two things I’d like people to take away from this. The first is that you NEED to swallow your pride and be able to ask for help if you want to quit. There was a time when I was trying every SINGLE weekend to quit dope, but could never make it to taking the suboxone, then it was back to the classroom on Monday. If I had come clean with my parents or my job earlier, I most likely would have been able to go to rehab a lot sooner and keep my job. Reach out!


The second thing is for those chippers out there. Now, I know that even after this whole story, there is at least one chipper thinking, “Ok, this girl may have been a little smarter and more successful than some, and wasn’t addicted to anything before, but there are clear mistakes here. Addiction ran in her family. Not mine. She controlled it for 8 months and then just used too many times in a row. Not gonna be me.”


But I URGE you to consider this story before trying dope or attempting to chip. No matter how smart and successful and responsible and controlled you are, it’s a fucking sneaky, mind-fuck of a drug. Please don’t play with fire. And even though I didn’t have an “addictive” personality before, I completely fucked my brain now. I will always have to deal with my addict thoughts telling me I can control my use. I knew better before. I know even better now. Also, you may think you’ve hit rock bottom, or that you’ve fallen as far as you can fall. But dope will always surprise you. There’s always a deeper level. I never thought I would be a junkie, and then once I was, I never thought I’d be a junkie struggling to pay for my habit each day, jobless, with a criminal record. 

Anyway, again, I’m not saying it’s impossible to chip. Everyone has their drug of choice. I just wanted to share my story. Thanks if you read the whole thing, I really appreciate it. ",1530144515.0

I would be willing to go to an inpatient detox, but I simply cannot because of work. I CANNOT miss work. But I want to be done with this shit and get on with my life. The only reason I am still using every day is because if I don’t I will go into withdrawal and not be able to function. Does anybody have any suggestions? I am desperate for help. It’s not like I’m broke either, I could afford suboxone or methadone if it was available. Also I truly only want to use these maintenance drugs for a week or so just to get back to normal, nothing long term. Please. I am tired of this life.",1530140638.0

One of my closest friends had his first child this weekend with his long term gf. Yesterday baby and mom came home from the hospital, took longer since it was a c section. Anyway he gets a call from the hospital and they inform him that baby and mom both tested positive for opioids. Since that's the case child protected services is gonna stop by the house. He said that his girlfriend told him she went to her doctor 2 weeks ago and she was given drugs to delay preterm labor and that the doctor said it contained opioids, although the labour and delivery nurses and Dr were never informed. Hes not buying this and neither is anyone in the family. Does or has anyone ever heard of such a thing? We've searched the interwebs far and wide and not a single mention of such thing can be found.

Wtf..help?","So sorry for the length.

I'm sitting here. In my living room, in the house i share with my husband. He is asleep in the bedroom. It is 5:39pm. 

I am unemployed, license is suspended. Husband is unemployed, disabled (hopefully only temporarily, but its been years) license suspended, and on probation. He also had spinal fusion surgery on 3 vertebrae in OCT 2017. Right after i lost my job. 

Ok, our house is in foreclosure. We are behind over $135,000 in principle payments. House cost us $295,000 and we put about $12,000 down. Mortgage payments were about $2700/month total, including insurance and taxes. We refinanced in 2009 (about 10 months after purchase) and payments became about $2400. We had no problems paying any bills until 2011 when my husband hurt his back otj (ups driver) super downhill from here, I'm sure you can imagine losing 75% of your household income. 

Anyway, sorry this does pertain to opiates/addiction. We were both light addicts when we met. A little vicodin or tramadol, but every day users. We are now full blown IV addicts.

We haven't been able to pick up in about a week and will be in withdrawal soon i imagine. We're maintaining with a little bit of subs, lope, benzos, weed (which i usually hate) and that thing we're not supposed to talk about. Sorry...

Anyway, i just got a call. Instead of foreclosure and being hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt, the bank is offering us $8500 and nothing owed or reported to credit bureau, if we can be out with all of our stuff in 60 days. More money if we can be out in 30. We don't get the money until we are out with the house ""broomswept clean"" 
THIS IS A DAUNTING TASK

I am a 36 year old, 96 pound girl. My husband cannot walk without a cane (hes only 35 btw) how can i pack up a whole 3 bedroom house, including 4 cats BY MYSELF and also, withdraw and get fucking clean. Not only that, but get my husband to get clean too. He could go to jail. He's on probation and has not been going (?!?!)
I feel like this is my only/last chance. What other choice do i have? I have amazing family that will house me and my 4 cats, but not my husband (long, typical addict story)

How do i do this? I can't get the simplest tasks done.  I'm not ready to be clean but i need to be. I don't want to be sober and it's only because I'm fucking bored and lazy. I hate what i have become.

How do i pull myself out of this? It's now or never and I have been given 6543356 chances and blown every single one catastrophically.

---

How I came to be in possession of said coffee is actually a funny story. I have friend/relative names Tyrone. He works for the local phone and internet monopoly, I mean company. He thinks quite highly of me despite knowing I'm a junky. He has always greeted me with respect at family gathering, as I rolled down torn sleeves to cover the tracks. What a shame to my mother I had become. Kill that thought. Forgive yourself. That is like... one of the most important steps in recovery right? Hell if I would know. 

Tyrone goes to many neighborhood homes on the pretense of fixing router problems or connectivity issues, etc. Well by happenstance on one of these visits, he was faced with an issue which was beyond his certification to mess with. This nice , North Dakota born, older lady (she moved here to the mountains for love) had a printer issue. This presented T with a problem. He couldn't help himself but if she keep it on the down low, I could fix it for her instead. He clued me into all of this at a recent family cookout (soo much joy at these I was probably zooted on some stolen benzedrex inhalers, a potent stimulant) very nonchalantly. I got her number and called within the next couple days as I worked up the courage. 

The first time I went there seemed normal enough. I stayed for a few hours and fixed her printer issues (I don't know printers but am a quick learner so I managed to get it all done via Google on my phone). The computer is in her bedroom oddly enough. Also she offered me a glass of wine which I gladly drank, swishing it around under my nose first to look like a pro. In retrospect I should have known something was up here...

I went back a few more times in between then and now. It became more apparent to me that she wanted me to come over to keep her company more so than fix her printer issue. One time the fix took literally two minutes. She would always keep me in a convo about her life story as I would slowly keep walking to my car. 

This brings us to yesterday. I wake up semi-sick as usual. Not too terrible due to bupe's long half life. Fuck! I remembered I had to go out in public today and fix her printer once again (damn these things seriously. Had another call for one in the same day) and wasn't even considering going unless fucked up. I pull off a thick quarter of a suboxone strip and toss it in my cleaned out nasal spray bottle. Then I mix in a half a cap of warm sterile water in with it and shake vigorously. I think for a second about how hard I'm shaking this bottle, just await that second it puts the mist out containing the sweet chemical goodness my membranes crave... 

Soo... I get that 2mg solution up my nose and let it dissolve. Then drop the rest under my tongue. I've already had a shit so I'm off now. I grab my mother's mail jeep keys she was kind to let me use. I grab some treats for the beast outside. I feed him and demand him to stay. He gazes at me angrily and confused.  Now in route to her house I think about the possibilities... i don't know these people. They always want things done immediately! They can't stand to wait an hour or a day. What if they wanna kill me or just tie me up as a sex slave? Fuck anxiety man.  

I pull into their driveway atop the huge hill (backing in to make it easier to leave). She is already standing outside, Miss Marcie. She is a lady in her 60s or so who you can tell is no spring chicken. She drinks the best wine and the best coffee and wears the finest in gold on her bony fingers. She greets me. ""I didn't know you worked for the post office?!"" I explain to her that it is my mother's vehicle as we slowly make our way to the door. The house is white and plain enough itself on the outside. The inside is clean and nicely kept. We wall through the living room and its nice big HDTV setup. Now we are in the bedroom where I promptly get to the electronics to make the situation more comfortable. 

""So what is the issue?"" I ask. She says a few things of little relevance such as ""well this light is blinking"" or ""it just stopped working"". In my experience with people who know little of technology, it is best to just use your own intuition to figure out the problem. I have her enter the password and I create a blank text document in which o send to print. Nothing. The light is blinking which means no wireless connection. Damn wireless things. 

In my frustration and concentration I have managed to lose sight of Marcie. Wait.. I hear her steps in the kitchen. She hollers, ""would you like an ice cream?"" And of course I would. She asks if caramel thingy is okay and I say ""I'll eat whatever"" because I basically will. I would later learn this to be my downfall. 

Now keep in mind I was high on dank and suboxone so sugar cravings do happen. I had to say yes to the ice cream. She brings it to me and it is like a brown cow with caramel inside. Yummy I think as I suddenly remember that the power had been flickering in our town recently. ""I figured it out"", I say confidently while licking my ice cream. I reset her router with a power cycle and voila! Fixed that easily again. She goes to give me some money for my time put in. This actually took hours somehow. What was in that ice cream? I thought jokingly. 

Now I put a virus scanner on her computer which isn't a bloated as fuck program like McAfee... I install MSE and do a quick scan. She wants me to stay and wait on it so she isn't stuck again. I agree if I could just use her restroom. As I'm taking a piss I take notice of a cabinet? Could it be? Nah I shouldnt... but I'm an addict. I was curious so I looked. Nope. Blood pressure stuff. 

I go back out and kindly ask for a cup of coffee while waiting. She just happened to have one cup left so I took it. ""Wow! I have never tasted good coffee!"" I told her. ""I'm a Folgers man"". She offers for me to take some home with me which leads us to now. I'm sitting here drinking a cup of her coffee. It is something exotic starting with a Z... it tastes sweet, possibly too sweet for my own good. 

In fact... I wonder if the ever-increasing stomachache and mild hallucinations I have been having since I left her house yesterday are related?",1530136637.0

Long story short, I have been snorting east coast powder for atleast 5 years and I recently have started shooting on a daily basis or whenever I have a decent bag which has been pretty steady since I got out of a 30 day rehab about 2 weeks ago. Here is the issue which I have only met one other person who this happens to also, when I shoot the same amount it takes me to get a rush from snorting or even a little bit more it does not come close to the high/rush and length of high as I would if I snorted it. Fuckin crazy eh? And no I'm not missing all of my shots, I have missed some esp. In the beginning when I was just starting, but I've even had experienced shooter friends hit me during multiple sessions to make sure. And the dope connect I have is also steady and stats good quality I would put it average about a 7. Good tannish rock sometimes light vinegar smell and draws up nice and clean in the rig. Now you may say I may need to do more, but why would it take MORE in the rig to get me just as lit as it would snortimy? Doesn't make sense and is the opposite of what I've heard is supposed to happen, so common sense would be to obviously keep snorting which is safer anyway, but just frustrates me a little that I can't get that INSTANT bliss from shooting. Any thoughts or input???",1530134919.0

Be Careful who you tell!,"OK long story short, started a  job in '05 (which i never lost surprisingly and still work for AND have been randomly drug tested at the whole time lol).  Which is where I met a pain clinic patient co worker/dealer friend.  Been On Opiates of all shapes and sizes ever since.  Finally got serious about stopping the grind in April 2015.  in which I haven't touched another NON-perscibed opiate since the day i walked into my now Methadone Clinic which I can say Probably Saved my Life.  Costs me 500 bucks a month even though i have insurance i guess insurance wont pick up that giant tab...  So that's like 12 grand+ so far, but worth it.  ANYWAYS, 2016 rolls around I'm starting to feel like i need to share my big secret with someone in my family in case something does happen and i need someone on my side of the family to let a doctor know I'm on maintenance treatment, blah blah plus just so someone know something.  I told my only sibling and, baby brother and gave him clear instructions that while i was going to tell my parents at some point in time DO NOT tell them cause i know how they will react and i wanted to control the narrative.  Fast forward to 2017, MY brother calls once or twice and i miss his calls both time cause i work full time and have a life.  I call him back on a lazy/sleepy Sunday afternoon and I'm sounding groggy as fuck.  Didn't think anything of it.  I miss his birthday by a day (Which i do every year, not sure why).  He tries to call sometime after his May bday and i miss it again.  So i try and call him back no answer.  fast forward to June of this year i notice hes not calling me back now.   I didn't really think anything of it other than he was busy with his life.  Mid June now and i had got my self into a small issue financially and just needed some money to get gas and groceries for the week and i asked my mom on a Tuesday for 60 dollars till Friday which i would have paid her back which I've done a couple time in the past.  I get a call from my mom and she kind of quiet and she goes ""I'm not do that anymore (meaning borrowing money she will be getting back in two days)...  Your brother told me about whats been ""Going on"" and I'm not sending you money now that your a ""big bad addict""(My words, not her lol).""  Well I knew right then and there that my brother had told her that i must have still been using and of course this made my blood boil because i have been clean from anything non prescribed for over two years at that point.  I knew exactly how she, my mom, would react and the fact that my brother straight up betrayed my trust for nothing i can see other than a few missed calls  in a years time its not like my bro was calling daily or anything desperately trying to reach my in a fervor.  He could have text, emailed called twice i would have known he wanted to seriously talk, instead he called maybe twice.  I straight up asked him ""Why would you tell them?!""  he says ""you cant expect me to just hang onto this information!,  they can get you the help you need now!"".  I was literally speech-less at this point cause i told him that i was clean and in treatment for nearly two fucking years now!.  I have to pee in a cup once a month random, have a group session a month, have a one on one with a counselor a month, and do a bunch of other little things in order to get take homes for a week.  So for him to act like such a coward that he was holding on to the big secret that he just need to let my parents know about was totally just cowardly and out of touch.  My Brother is this big college grab who lives in D.C. with his attorney Wife and all his hipster out of touch friends.  My mom doesn't understand any of it obviously my brother obviously doesn't either.  Now I'm estranged from them, and all this i was trying to avoid by telling the one person i figured i could trust.  Lesson being people that have never been around Opiates will never understand maintenance treatment to the world absence is still the only thing that means ""sober"" So be extra Careful who you bring this info too.

It’s been a blessing at times because normally I don’t last more than 30 seconds, and Oxy would make me last for hours on end. 

However whenever I don’t release, I get excruciating pain in my testicules and abdomen AKA “blue balls”. I can never find a medium or a solution. I’ve tried stopping temporarily but I cant afford to be sick for work, etc.. and I lose total interest in sex overall, I’ve tried stimulants to try and achieve climax sooner (Adderall, Concerta, caffeine) in which none produced that effect.

It’s an embarrassing question to ask but I can’t find an answer anywhere else being a guy and just getting ridiculed/jokes (which are expected). The Suboxone makes me not able to achieve an orgasm, & most times even after hours, still nothing. It’s painful, it’s annoying, and it sometimes makes my girlfriend annoyed too.

Is it possible for someone who sniffs fent to self administer Narcan? Backstory: My ex has overdosed three times over the last year (the last time being 3 weeks ago at my home) and for the first time he will be moving into his own apartment this weekend and living by himself.  He tried to get clean (or so he says) several times throughout our relationship and I tried to support him in any way I could. I took care of him while he detoxed, gave him kratom, pushed him to connect with a counselor, bought him Tracey's book for inspiration, etc. He does OK for a bit and then ends up drinking too much and relapses. He was fortunate enough to have people around to call for help in the past, but now I am terrified he is going to OD when he is at home by himself. I love him with all my heart and the thought of him dying alone like that is tearing me up inside. If I sent him home with my Narcan supply, would it be possible for him to feel an OD ""coming on"" and self administer since he sniffs it? Has anyone ever done this or heard of anyone doing it?

Now that that's out of the way, here's my current situation: As recently as last Friday, I was a resident of a sober house, had 75 days clean off of everything, and was on 12 mg of bupe that I was taking every day as directed.  Well, on Friday, I became overwhelmed by boredom and got in touch w a connect--honestly I think I was looking for the rush of the pick-up as much as actually using anything. And I ended up picking up coke and fent (I sniff). Friday night, I sniffed some fent, knowing it probably wouldn't get me high due to the subs, but to reduce the anxiety from the coke comedown, and it definitely worked for that.  Saturday, my mentality was, ""Well, I know I fucked up, but I just want to do the fentanyl today now that it's been 24 hours since the last sub dose."" And so I did little bumps spaced out every couple hours.  I did notice myself feeling it more over the course of the day.  But I still didn't feel it full throttle, so I thought, ""Let me just hang onto it for one more day, then I'll toss whatever's left and get back on subs."" So I did more Sunday, so now we're talking 3 days in a row of all day use. By that point I had voluntarily left my house and grabbed a hotel in town.  By the time Sunday night rolled around, I remember having the feeling of, ""I really should throw this out"", but not being able to bring myself to do so, having that addict part whisper, louder and louder, and then shout, ""Fuck no! You are not throwing this away, you're doing it and then you're picking up more!""  And then I thought, ""I am so fucked.""  The good news is I still have subs, and can self-detox.  The bad news is, I'm totally psychologically dependent again already and soon will be physically dependent again (of course I already am when you consider the 12 mg daily sub use from before this run).

TL/DR: I had 75 days clean and then relapsed totally out of the blue.  Now I'm right back in the shit and just trying my best to stay safe.",1530104550.0

My muscles burned.  I grunted or moaned every step.  It was almost impossible to walk, like I had muscular dystrophy or something, and by now I was sure the lack of chemicals had turned my pupils to the size of nickels.  There was undoubtedly a layer of grease shellacked onto my forehead.  A single strand of snot hung from my nose in the wind and fluttered.  Still I shuffled towards the trio, determined to get that cigarette.

I stood some distance from them.  I asked, 


“Excuse me, but could any of you could spare a smoke?”  But they never looked towards me.  I tried again.  “EXCUSE ME!”  They continued their conversation.




The girl had a big nose and thin lips.  She was pretty and rambled on the way the way pretty girls can with strange men who will give them attention.  Her boyfriend wore a backwards hat and cheap sunglasses while he stood next to her nodded out, like he was trying to touch his nose to the concrete.  The girl kept calling him baby. I spoke again.


“HEY!  EXCUSE ME!  CAN I GET A CIGARETTE!”  None of the three looked up.  My voice must have disappeared from the withdrawals.  The fat man just laughed.

He said, “What’s baby having anyway?  Shoot!  I want some of whatever baby’s having!  Haw haw haw!”  

“Me too.”  I said laughing like I was in on the joke, but they didn’t hear that either.  I could only whisper in my weakened state and the remaining 20 feet I’d have to walk to tap one of them on the shoulder was too far for me.  So, I turned around and walked back towards the bus.  As my left foot slid onto the bottom step of the bus, a warm slime splattered and ran down the back of my leg.  The sickness was just too much.  There was nothing I could do.  No clothes.  No energy to change them, even if I had any.  For the rest of the trip, I stayed slumped in my seat like a soggy, stinky sock, sitting in my own mess, sneezing and sniffling and whimpering for the remaining 12 hours back to my hometown.
  
It was late at night when the driver announced our arrival and I heard the release of the bus’s brakes.  Somehow, sleep had come over me for a moment, the way it does during heroin withdrawals, miserable and fleeting.  Everyone else who got off the bus there was bantering with the driver and crouching to see into the luggage store under the bus for their bags.  I was wearing everything I owned.

Before then I only had an oxycodone habit. I would have done dope in a heartbeat but I never had the chance.

Through junkie jesus luck I found a really chill middle to get dope. I was taking double, triple my sub script (I was on the road to relapse abusing subs). I ran out two weeks early and decided to dive headfirst into dope.

My middle didn’t try to play me, he told me it was fentanyl and to be extremely cautious.

I still go to my recovery center, I do want to stop but that’s a whole other topic. My urine screens show a high load of fentanyl only.

The powder I get is most always pure white, fluffy like flower. Sometimes the real strong stuff has little off white pebbles that taste extremely bitter, unmixed fentanyl I imagine. The first few bags had what I think were crushed xanax. There were smashed light blue pieces that tasted exactly like xanax. That stuff was really good despite being absolutely frankenstein fentadope.

Well last night and tonight’s bags sure are something different. The powder is more of a tan color with dark brown flecks in it. It smells slightly of vinegar and boy howdy does it have the best high.

This stuff is literally the best feeling I have had since my first 40mg original oxycontin back in the day before I had a monkey on my back.

When I take a sniff it doesn’t hit my head almost instantly like heavy fentadope. It creeps. Unlike fentanyl I feel it through out my body. Infact the euphoria and warmth just grows and grows over 20-30 minutes. It is the best and strongest euphoria.

Without a doubt it still contains fentanyl but the high is so different, lasts so much longer and is so euphoric.

I hope all ya’lls that are in it like me have stuff to make you feel good tonight and tomorrow morning! End dope fueled opiate love rant.",1530070614.0

sorry for repeating these nightly but we opiate enthusiasts have the memory of a goldfish so people need nightly reminders. here you are.  

we were stripped from having mod privileges for violating terms of service or something so i have to use my private room apparently? it's the same except it has the youtube player and actual moderation. repeat, new room link, same old chat.   

for those who are unaware tc is a video chat platform that while not perfect, seems to work well for phones and browsers alike. this room is for hanging out, listening to music, and specifically harm reduction so no one has to use alone. it is unaffiliated with r/opiates and its moderators and has its own rules and etiquette. here are the revised and updated rules:  

1) don't do any sort of -isms, it's just not cool and i run a leftist room. your opinions are welcome but no personal attacks or nasty stuff about groups of people. if you want to be rude, get personal, there's plenty of stuff to say about people without going for low-hanging fruit.  

2) don't make obnoxious noises over the mic, or play music over the chat. the bitrate for the sound channel is like 4, everything sounds like crap unless it's played through the built-in youtube player.  

3) don't dox anyone or take pictures or record the chat, this is a place people come to feel comfortable doing various things and anything that violates privacy results in an instant ban.  

4) guests must pick a unique username. no lurking allowed because people stalk people and shit. aside from these, just don't be rude or a douche.  

also, if you don't like me, or the mods, or the room, or anything else, just don't comment and move on. please don't be a hot mess on here, they're doing a good job.  ",1530068783.0

There was this crow on the ground & a ton in the tree caw caw bitchin at me. So i got comfortable on the other side of this tree & planned to smoke some dope before going to sleep.  Ended up passing out before i could tho, i woke up to the crow on the ground wiggin the fuck out. It was then i realized this crow was fucked, he had a broken neck, could not stop seizing, could barely walk, & was just flailing about in general. Squawking like crazy.

“Oh shit buds, you’re right fucked arnt ya. Them crow pricks torturing you eh? Bastards. Hey! I got something that will make ya feel alright.” 

Spent the night blowing out smoke at this guy, & eventually just holding the pipe near his face to catch smoke cause i was already nice n toasty. 

He would stretch put his head the best he could to get that gud. He calmed right down, he still had a persistent twitch but it was way less severe. He folded up his wings , got comfy & sat down right beside me.

I ended up passing out for a bit, he woke me up by jumping at me a few hours later for that RE-UP. Smoked him up again.

I left at dawn , feeling conflicted as i left. I didnt want to leave him & I didnt have the gut to do what should have been done & put him out. I feel pre good about making his night of hell a bit better tho. The other crows have most likely finished picking him to pieces by now. R.I.P 

I told him I loved him multiple times & genuinely had a good night chilling with this left 4 dead crow. I felt like i could relate with this crow. Ill miss you [buds.](http://imgur.com/XjZ0h5S)",1530067840.0

I would get paid to do VIP events at the best clubs with free bottle service and never had a shortage of hot chicks. I was a true hustler.

The partying and drinking would lead to after parties with tons of coke and banging girls in the bathrooms of these parties. I was an alcoholic and as the parties got crazier it started to erode my family life, I had a GF at home and a small baby. I guess she finally got tired of my drinking and cheating and split. This split turned my life upside down and ended up moving in with this super hot chick after one drunken and crazy event. She told me I could move in and do anything I wanted with her, little did I know.

The first night I remember her smoking some shit on foil, I thought is was crack cocaine but really didnt care, we all know know she was chasing the dragon. I watched her do this for about  a week before I got drunk and wanted to try it. I didnt even like it, made me itchy and drive/talk like a retard but Im not a quitter and kept going. About a month later of daily smoking I wanted to quit, but little did I know I couldnt. I was addicted. The of course led to me leaving the utility company and ruining my side hustle, all I cared about was getting well now but hated being a slave to this shit. First thing I did was kicked the hot model girl to the curb, literally kicked her ass to the curb on her birthday and right after her grandma died, wanted to make sure she wouldnt come back. This lead me going to rehab for the first time and a year long course of subs. Took a fucking year for me to finally figure out how to quit subs, the detox facility wanted me on lifelong maintenance and started me super high. I finally got off and fucking hate opiates.

2016 Four years have passed and Im opiate free. Im in amazing shape, have a super hot wife, nice cars and nice house and a semi decent job with 2 kids now. Im doing maintenance at a gym, I love to workout because thats my new drug. My co-worked is some old dude in his 60's, pretty cool but pretty square, I thought. One day I walk in our work area and homeboy is railing something, Im like its all good man I used to do H. I thought he was doing coke, it was oxy and he offered me a rail. Wanted him to see I wasnt going to rat so I did the rail. Next day he offers again, Im like sure why not, its only pills lol.

About thrice a month homeboy would get some oxy 30s from his friends script and we would party. Its when I was hit up by an old friend out of prison that things really took off. Unlimited supply of a variety of oxy and opana and all kinds of other goodies for dirt cheap. My old co-worked financed us every single damn week till we got to the point of being high or sick, no in between.

Here I am now 2018 and still have all the good shit in my life and think about quitting for good sometimes but really dont want to. I still take breaks with sometimes a couple months off but always find a reason to go back, the price is fucking crazy good and Ive become an opi snob now but dont fuck with H anymore. I even got detoxing down pretty good by using quick sub tapers. My wife knows I like to party and she puts her foot down sometimes but she still lets me do my thing as long as I dont drink alcohol. I think some people are true addicts because if Im not doing opis Im doing something else. Anyways, dman has some goodies coming my way and will be on vacation with them. 

Some words of advice if youre a young guy, dont start fucking with opiates till youre at least 25 or better yet dont start at all. Stick to the pussy, weed and booze. Opiates will replace everything you find joy in and will consume your life.

I'm worried I may have screwed up something in my system. Some hormones have become seriously out of whack or I've developed some kind of chemical imbalances in my brain.

Little over 5 years am I a chronic pain patient. I just got 22 years old.

I'm suffering from tingeling feeling (the same feeling you get when the doctor messes up a lumbar puncture, and you feel electricity in your whole body) in my left leg. The pain /feeling is constant, over the years it getting worse.

In those 5 years  I have been multiple times fully examined (pictures taken (X-ray, NMR, CT,...), blood taken, DNA analytics, MS-test,  biopsies,...) and nothing was found. As an alternative for the pain killers the doctors tried almost all existing antidepressants (not for the mental sake), if those in a rare occasion worked it always was for a short time + I got all the side effects you can imagine. After all those experiments / tests the doctors still don't now what It can be the cause of it.

My painkiller scheme:

The first years I was suffering, they gave me Paracetamol and Paracetamol with Codeine, these two didn't do a thing.

I started with Tradonal, I took it for more then 2 years  my start dosis was 100 mg 1X day increasing the dosis to 2x200 mg and 250mg on bad days. The last year I took it, it did't really work the habituation was to strong.

My doctor gave me Tilidine (Valtran), which I took for a month here the habituation was so strong I had to stop it.

The next pain killer he gave me was Oxycodone, when I was taking this I felt weird, so I only took it a week or so + it did not help that much.

The last thing he gave me was Fentanyl/Durogesic 25 micro gram, this works more or less. I'm taking this for more than over a year now.

Now for almost 2 months, I feel my penis is getting numb, I do not know  if it is caused by my unknown condition or long-therm side effect off the Fentanyl. It is not at all sensitive anymore.

General remark, I never am/was at any time addicted to painkillers, I'm able to stop taking them at any time. Although the pain would be so severe I'm tied to bed as long as I do not take them again just for the pain sake. I'm a Law student and my memory/grades are severely affected by the painkillers and my pain an sich, so if anyone has an idea for alternative painkillers or is in a similar situation, please let me know.

So i've been doing opiates since like 2006 or 2007. i moved to a new city 5 years ago. when i first moved here I worked with a guy that would sell me his extra tabs each month and that was about all i could find besides boy and i really didn't want to start doing that again so i just took the tabs when i could get them and got roxies whenever id make the 6 hour drive back to my home state. So eventually we had a new guy start at work (we'll call him S.E.) that could get pandas. id only ever heard whispers about them when i lived down south. literally no one i knew had ever seen one or done one so when this guy told me he could get them i got one and fell in love. 

So i dealt with this guy as my middle man for like 2 years and everything was straight. Then he started getting sketchy and doing a lot of dope. he ended up ODing at work and i had to grab his lunchbox and find his shit and flush it while he was getting narcaned in the middle of the shop. so he got his job back because it was a union shop and he used fake piss when he came back and had to take a drug test lmao. (that doesn't have anything to do with this post really, its just a story i find funny as shit #ThanksUnion) So eventually S.E. owed me a decent amount of money and we got into an argument and it ended with me backing him up against his truck and telling him that he was going to give me my money OR he could introduce me to his dealer and id forget about the money. so of course he took the free option and then i started going through his guy (we'll call him T.W.) which was great for about a year. so here recently ole T.W. went to rehab, then when he got out he decided he was going to sell pandas and not do any dope since he'd gotten the vivitrol shot and couldn't really get fucked up anyways. So since he hadn't been to work in a while he was broke so he couldn't re-up and be an actual dealer so he was kind of a middle man. id meet him and then we'd go to the plug (we'll call him B.B.). id buy 5 pandas for $80 a pop and then T.W. would get like 10 for that amount of money because he was getting them for like $40 or $45 a piece. i didn't really complain because he was my only connect and $2 a mg isn't that horrible of a price for pandas. So iv'e seen B.B. and hes seen me a few times but we've never talked. So after a month T.W. started shooting meth and became ridiculously unreliable. now hes fallen off the face of the earth. His phone is off and i cant get a hold of him. So last night i searched through every one of his face book friends and i fucking found B.B. So iv'e been to this guys work to pick up from B.B. when i was with T.W. and like i said the guy has seen me multiple times but we've never talked. so here's where my need for advice comes in. Should i just show up at B.B.'s work (furniture store) and  buy a piece of cheap furniture from him and then bring up the fact that i know T.W. and try to talk him into serving me or should i message him on Facebook and see if he'll respond or call me? He always seemed a little sketched out when i would show up with T.W. but i guess that could have just been from me and T.W. being white boys and just pulling up to his house or work in the hood lol. but yeah guys i'm not sure which option is better or if i should just not even approach the guy at all and try to find a new hook up. i know if i was a legit dealer and some random dude id only seen a few times messaged me on FB id probably just ignore it or block the guy. so i'm worried if i message him on FB he'll block me and then kick me out of his work if i show up there lol. i just feel like i'm so close to having a decent hook up but still so very far away lol. but yeah so what do ya'll think? what would you do if you were in my shoes? Thanks for taking the time to read this long fucking post and responding. Stay safe out there fam.

That’s a problem legally here, but it’s easy for us to trade him some pot for the pills. It’s a better deal for all involved. He gets plenty of what he wants for the month, and we get what he’s prescribed. All he gets is those pink 10s, not enough for my boyfriend and I for the month by far, more like just a little supplement.  

This is been going on for a very long time now.  He got filled last Friday, and actually they’re all completely gone now. We had some people over, and we were just kind of popping and snorting them all day.

It’s been pretty nice, until today. Apparently he got a call from his insurance agency. I don’t know all the details, but I think they want to see what he has left for the month, and possibly pop a drug test on him to make sure he has Oxy in his system.

If we never have another transaction with him again, that’s fine with me, I just don’t want him to get in trouble! What if down the line his cancer puts him in some real severe pain, and they won’t give him something strong enough because they’re worried that he has abused the system in the past. This guy isn’t a delinquent, just a nice old man who grew up in the 60s and wants to smoke a joint when he doesn’t feel good.

I have no idea what to do for him.  I don’t know anybody who has the pink 10s that he has, so it’s not like we can run out and replace whatever he should have. I don’t know if that would work anyway, this is nothing I’ve ever dealt with before.

Anyone have any suggestions?

Edit:  Update!  

My boyfriend, who I swear has Junkie Jesus on speed dial, has found a line on enough pinks to get him through.  A semi distant buddy of his, who actually also has cancer, is willing to “lend” us the pills for the count.  He’ll hang with us while our neighbor goes on his appointment, and we’ll wait for a thumbs up. 

He sells them at $7 per, and if for any reason something goes wrong, and the pills end up confiscated or otherwise “lost”, we’ll simply pay for them, and take the loss.  Whatever it takes to get our neighbor through.   This guy sells his pills, so he’s sympathetic of our neighbor’s plight.

8u1yz5,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8u1yz5/god_bless_methadone/,22,https://redd.it/8u1yz5,rachelmadcow1,God bless methadone.,"After fucking my life and relationships up with drug use I finally drug my ass to a methadone clinic a few weeks ago. Today I finally reached a reasonable dose of 150mg. 

While on my journey up to 150 mg- 10 mg at a time a day- I was somehow miraculously able to repair my relationships and get a job. 

This morning on the way back from the clinic I got the urge to cuddle. So I decided to surprise my girlfriend and stopped by her house.  The door was locked and it appeared she was sleeping so, not wanting to wake her by knocking,I started walking back towards my car when I heard her door open. Butterflies began filling up my stomach. 

I ran inside and she kissed me. Apparently I was forgiven. Thank Jesus!- (Both of them). 

After some chit-chat we cuddled up on her bed. She wasted no time- we hadn't been alone together in over two weeks. She immediately yanked my shorts off and began slobbering all over my knob. Yes! This was perfect timing. The methadone hadn't fully kicked in to the point where orgasm would be impossible but was enough to prevent me from blowing my load immediately. It was time to go to Pound Town population 2. 

She hopped on me and inserted my fat throbbing cock into her taught and moist cunt.  She rode my dick like I was a bull named Fu Man Chu and she was Harry Thompkins- three time gold belt rodeo champion of Texas. 

This was magical. I then decided to put those two red bulls I drank with breakfast to good use. I flipped us over and rested her legs on my shoulders. Time for the grand finale boys. I beat that pussy up until she was crying tears of bliss and moaning ""ohhhhh my god'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd""

Then it happened I blew my biggest load to date-  76 ml. Cream pie city bitch. 

Now I'm on my way to a job interview. 

What I'm trying to say is God bless methadone. Things are starting to look up romantically and financially. Thanks to this medication I am now able to get my life back on track. 

Stay strong my friends. The struggle is real but every once in awhile an opportunity presents itself to better your situation, possibly for good. 

Keep it real my Opies! ✌🏽

The cat is reasonably a giant asshole, but has never fucked up my kid. My kid on the other hand, he is an UNreasonably giant asshole and has fucked the cat up on several occasions. He’s gone as far as putting him in the dryer and turning it on, putting him in a choke hold and saying he’s giving him big hugs, and for fucks sake, buried him under a mass pile of pillows and was jumping on him! 

I tried busting that ass, telling him if we can’t be nice to the cat, the cat will have to go away to a new home (I’m calling his bluff there) and I even tried kind of (safely, of course) roughing him up the way he does the cat and he just thinks it’s hilarious.

So tell me why now every time I walk by the back door, he has left the door open to let my cat out. He is truly the most “fuck it” child I’ve ever met. He’s probably thinking to himself, ”I ain’t being nice to that fucking cat, and they won’t make *ME* leave, so off the furry fuck goes!” 😂

I love my kid. I love my cat. Why can’t they coexist in peace?! 

I’m also absolutely tripping about the fact that I am about to have another baby in approximately six weeks and I’m terrified that he is going to do something to his new brother. 

TLDR; OLD CAT AND YOUNG KID CAN’T BE TOGETHER WITHOUT KID FUCKING UP CAT. WORRIED THAT HE WILL FUCK UP NEW BABY THAT WILL BE HERE IN 6 WEEKS.

So anyway it was so bad halfway through the bag of meth I said fuck it and went to go see one of my friends who likes g, but she know where to get vicoden. Asked if she could trade but she want able to get em at the time. So I gave her the meth anyway and told her to get me back when she could get some.

Well tonight me and my bro were pretty dope sick again and out of nowhere we hear a knock on the window its her and she has 10 vics and 5 fresh rigs for us. Feeling ok now. Hmm... Maybe karma is real.",1530013388.0

I love you but I am supposed to hate you...,"I've been..err, was clean for a month until just now. My main connect when I was using got arrested and I was forced to go thru the worst middle ever. He would charge me 10 bucks for the service, I'd pick him up drive him to the plug's house and then have him charge me around 20% over the going rate for our area (Seattle- $80 a gram) because ""this guy charges more than other dealers"" and then he'd pinch a shots worth of my tar.  Sometimes he'd take half hour to come out of the house because ""dude made him wait"" for whatever lame excuse.. I am sure he was just fixing a shot of my dope. Well... I finally got tired of the games and decided to clean up my act and detoxed on my own, at home, with the help of Kratom after a few agonizing days of cold turkey.   Well, tonight I was looking at FB and my old dealer sent me a message.. she's out of jail and can meet up anytime I want!   I tore up my debit card when I got clean because.. well, you all know why.. I didnt want easy access to money at night.  My connect was cool with accepting change so I went to my junk drawer etc and came  up with $30 in quarters.   The 20 minute drive to her new house felt like an hour..  and after exchanging pleasantries and pretending to give a fuck about catching up and hearing about her new place and job.. she weighed me out a half gram and I made the 4 hour drive home.  I noticed I was singing along to the music on the radio and was in a wonderful mood.. the mere anticipation of the shot I was going to do actually made me feel high.. the mental aspect of opiate addiction is CRAZY, but most of you already know that.  When I had decided to clean up I threw out all my tools of the trade except the sharpest of the dull, used rigs that was in the bottom of my ""sin bin""  somehow.. I had the sense to save one and tonight I am so glad I did!  I just cooked up .3 and slammed her home.. I connected with my rested up vein on the second try and that red plume was just as beautiful as I remembered.  Now I am going to have a snack and go to bed.. and actually sleep!  The tossing and turning with one or two hours of actual sleep that has become my sober life isn't going to get me tonight!  The self control I have so far in saving a morning shot has me feeling like I am in complete control lol.  I pre made a pot of coffee so tomorrow I can just turn it on as I go into the bathroom to fix, when I come out of the bathroom I'll have hot coffee waiting for me and an entire day of bliss.. no post acute withdrawl pain for me... at least not tomorrow.

I only weight 120 so I feel like this should be plenty... I plan on trying again and taking some before my morning blunt (in about 4 hours). Should I up the dose or try again with 4 pills and then the blunt? If I do up the dose, I’m thinking 30-40mg (6-8 pills). I don’t think this amount of acetaminophen should be harmful?

Update: still no euphoria but the shit made me itchy as fuck. So irritating I can’t even fall asleep. Will try 6 pills in  a few hours. Hopefully the blunt will subside this side effect. Will also try taking Benadryl or some type of antihistamine.",1529999255.0

He bags me up my shit and let's me try his new fire 🔥  ass dope which he gives me along with the coke and gives me my bags. 

He then throws me this extra bag, which was at least a grams worth if not more, and tells me, ""Here, take this shit too, cause you snort right? This stuff has a bit of this tea stuff,  you can use it like an opiate, it's like heroin.."" Immediately I knew it was kratom & said, ""Kratom is really weak, it takes at least multiple grams eaten or drank and it is literally dried tea leaves . That's not a good cut really."" He said he knew & he is only giving it to snorters cause he understands how fucked the dope is. 

He kinda got how kratom doesn't work thru the nose or smoked and he reassured me there was only a very small amount of kratom in the dope, but i could definitely smell it and see it as the dope had a slight green tint. So since I got it for free I was like fuck it, racked up a few lines. It immediately smells & tastes like heroin with kratom in my nostrils & I exhale a small puff of it too, cuz... kratom I guess. This deff works as heroin but god damn it is stupid as shit. Like now 75% of the users cant use it cause they shoot and it's just a useless cut in general. I told him it was wack and I wouldn't pay for that dope, and thankfully he got the message.

Took me like 15 mins just to write the title in btwn nods lol. So here's my short story. I caught 2 distro charges last year & then took a plea mandating me to treatment. The alternative was minimum 1 year in jail. So I stayed clean the entire time of the mandate & I completed on time!! 
Yes I know I relapsed, & I'm also aware of what I did & what I'm currently doing wrong.
With that being said.. I'm speechless trying to describe this shot. I've been sniffing the past week because I was too shook to dive back into it going straight to the needle after 9 months off. After 10+ years of heroin use.. I dont think I've ever had a better high then I'm having right now. Just had to share this with someone!!

Also I could use some education. I'm not looking to get back into actively using every day. I really want to just be able to chip here and there. Obviously I've gotten off to a bad start but I'm not getting high again for another week or 2. My question is , around how long does it take the body to develop a physical dependency on dope? Or if I was using every single day.. how long would it take before I start waking up sick? I once heard it takes about 2 weeks before you're hooked. I just got high 7 days in a row.. what do yous think?

Okay, so why my place is getting built I moved in with my grandparents because of how much extra room they have. Now my uncle and SO live with my grandparents and have for the last 3 years. They both are addicts as well and there was a 3 day period last week she gave me 1 piece a day to stay somewhat well (basically saved it until 8 so I could sleep) and I was super grateful. So a few nights ago I got some and gave her a whole B which was more than she gave me total. The other night I gave her a half b and some white cause they like it, but never buy it so I thought they'd like that. I gave it to them at 8 AM and said if you need some tonight, just ask. They never did, and left for the night. She came back at 7 and was sick I guess and text me as soon as she got in ""Thanks for nothing."" So I call her out and remind her that I told her to ask if she needed and she did not and left all night, not my problem. My uncle didn't give two shits. Come last night around 7 PM my hooks phones off and the others closed already, so I ask my uncle if he'd get it through theirs and he agreed. I did 40 cause it's not that good of shit and it was already late. Glad I did because she stole it off his dresser while he was in the shower. He tracked her down after she was already out for four hours saying ""oh I'm getting it we just have to go here"" my uncle tells me that she was all butt hurt how he was helping me after I let them go sick?? He tried explaining the situation to her and she didn't care to hear it. She comes back at midnight and says cash is in my purse. Tell my uncle you should just grab it and do the deal. He forgets and she says my guy is here, just going around the block.. Next thing we know her phones off and she walks in all nonchalant at 5 AM like all was good? My uncle is livid at this point, even more so than I cause I expect it from her now after the previous nights events. She than tells him ""We went 3 different places and no one had anything besides Clear."" We both know she's lying and was out sucking dick, or using that $40. I'm pretty sure it wasn't the latter of the two. One because she does ho herself out for shit, two she loves clear a ton and three we all know that $40 was spent on her first excursion that night. They suck as a couple, my unk is a good hearted dude, and she's crazy. He feels the need to take care of her for some reason. They fight all the time too. The most annoying shit. Anyways, still nothing. So I say I want the money, she says I left it in his car and he's coming back now and he got shit so I will go up to his window and just grab it. He gets back here at 7 AM, she's tweaked out and were asleep, so of course she dips and I woke up as she got in his car and woke my unk up and told him to check it out, which I feel bad for cause no one should wake up feeling like that. She turns her phone off, comes back at 10 AM crying and claims they were robbed of the $40 hahaha. At this point it's comical and I don't even care anymore, I learned a lesson to never trust her again. Today my guy was open again and I got a lot of shit, she wanted some and I didn't give them each one this time. I gave my uncle a half b and let him do what he wanted with it. Tonight I will have him ""come help move my bed"" and give him a few rips and she can fuck off! Haha

Friday comes around and she doesn’t get them till after the “pick up” time at fedex due to her car problems. Whatever, shit happens.

Anybody in conjunction with yourself? Did you always exhibit an addictive personality? I started experimenting heavily with weed and alcohol in sophomore year of high school with my brother. He would steal my grandma's percocet. And as much as I would surf bluelight and erowid and the likes about psychedelics, things like opiates I didn't really check out at all. Maybe because they were so relatively ""boring"". So I tried that 10/325 and I didn't feel anything. It took 2 more isolated tries before I got that opiate bliss nod. Then one day his friend came down to visit and left him some black. I didn't really hesitate at all to try it. I think because I looked up to him so much? Anyways, I struggle a lot with the blame game nobody forced me to do it. But then again I can't help but think how different things would be if he hadn't offered these things. But then I think of how much of a waste of energy and emotion it is to deliberate on the blame game. Like writing out this post. I don't know. Getting and staying clean is really hard.

Please add input fellow opioid addicts. I need some people who understand how I feel and what I’m going through. I need some hope.,"    Here it is plain and simple: A person can’t even remotely relate, empathize or understand even slightly what we go through and why we are the way we are. If somebody tells me a bunch of shit about opiate addiction and has never tried them it goes in one ear and out the other. A person who has tried opiates, heroin and needles especially, can understand why this stuff hooks you the way it does. People, my mom for instance, thinks that I just can’t get right and do it because I have bad morals and values. 

     I had been to 4 A&D drug programs before trying IV drugs. Sadly I craved heroin and dilaudid SO bad from age 15 to 18 after hearing story’s about it. I got a tattoo on my rib cage in my first adult rehab. It says “With the birds I’ll share this lonely view”. Red Hot Chili Peppers wrote this song about heroin. I got the tattoo, because I knew I was going to be addicted to heroin. I craved it before I ever tried it all the time.

     I have mental health issues that are all severe.   Depression, anxiety and PTSD. I also have the disease of addiction (duh). When I am in active addiction NOBODY can tell me shit. My brain tells me “This is all you need for your depression and anxiety”. A shot isn’t about how long the ride is, it’s about that moment where you feel at complete peace and bliss. That moment after a shot feels like an eternity. 

      Currently I’m free of the demon Heroin 1 year and 9 months off opiates. I’m sorry for the rant guys I just need y’all right now because y’all understand what I am going through. I’m on suboxone, but lately I want a shot so fucking bad I can barely take it. They said the first year is the toughest and after that it’s so much easier. Bullshit. The only reason I’m clean is because I force myself to take my medicine so I have the safety net of not being able to get high while on it. 

     My Dad passed away, clean 5 years before his death and was huge in AA. I wish he was here so bad because he understood me. Anyways my mom is an opioid addict living with a doctor that used to own a pain clinic and has a walk in safe with every narcotic imaginable. My mom called me asking what Fentora was one day which is fucking Fentanyl tablets you put under your tounge. My moms boyfriend’s ex wife just died less than 2 years ago from an overdose. I’m scared she’s going to die and she’s all I have.

      I’m only 22. I have to sell drugs to get by because my car is in the shop and hasn’t been running for 9 months. I hate selling drugs. I only sell pills to people that use them as medicine, but I got busted by the narcs at a friends house and it scares me to be selling still. I had 7 different narcotics in a pill bottle they pulled right out of my pocket. In my room I had tons of anabolic steroids and liquid Xan and Valium. God BLESSED me because I only got one drug charge possession of meth. 

    One time I had a stash of heroin, benzos, cash, etc. sitting on my bedside table. I woke up to my mom screaming at me. At this point in my addiction I had to have something in the morning or I would go through violent withdrawal. I was crying on my knees for her to give me a Klonopin and pain pill out of the bottle and she could have the rest, but she wouldn’t. I said “Mom I love you, but I can’t take it anymore I’m going to kill myself”. I without hesitation got in my car, drove 75mph dead into a telephone pole. No seatbelt I just threw my hands in the air. I had not a scratch on me. The paramedics arrived and told me the one I hit had termites in it and was rotten, but if I had hit any other pole I would have instantly died. They put me on a stretcher and asked if I was in pain. They gave me an IV shot of fentanyl. It didn’t get me high but I all of a sudden felt normal again. 


     I’m so sorry this is long I probably won’t get many comments but I need some solid advice. I live alone in my own house with no car in a VERY small town in Mississippi. I have some decent friends, but they aren’t “Ride or die”. I seriously want to dilaudid or heroin so bad y’all I’m hurting emotionally so fucking bad. If I’m going to feel like this forever I might as well get back on the shit. 

Summary: People don’t understand opiate addicts if they have never tried them. Clean off Heroin for a year, but recently have been craving it so bad. Having thoughts of self harm and been crying my eyes out writing this hoping maybe someone will reach out to me.",1529961260.0

I have another intact 8mg sub-- but im curious as to whether I should continue to taper on sub (it feels like im stagnating at 0.5mg, with it harder to half the dose than it was to half 2mg to 1mg), or quit the sub now and continue the taper with some kratom or loperamide?

what would you do? im cautious with the sub cos ive heard some horror stories of its dependence, and i feel i'd be better off leaving that 8mg sub untouched in case its ever needed again (and braking up that much extra sub may encourage me to drag out the taper longer than needs be)

i should say-- when i do cut my sub dose in half below what it is, the only real symptom i notice is goosebumps-- but i tend to hyperfocus on em

i also have some fucked notion that alternating opiods during a taper reduces the chance of becoming dependant on any replacement (e.g peripheral relief via loperamide, shorter half life from kratom)

I took 25mg and thought “Dang these are incredible why doesn’t everyone take these”. My whole High School years, except around the end of senior, did I even start to smoke often. I went to strict private school and it was considered low down and skanky to smoke. I took alllllllllll kinds of different pills all the time throughout HS and genuinely believed weed was worse.

Some of you may find this funny.,"So me and my girlfriend of 7 years are trying to have a baby, we are both 27 and think its time to start a family. My girl does not use drugs and only drinks once in a while. I use oxy on the regular but have been trying to slow down after my script got cut. You all know how that goes but I'm trying.   


Anyway we have been trying to have a kid for about a year and a half and haven't gotten pregnant, so we were recommended to a infertility clinic which we went to and my girlfriend had to get a bunch of tests done because it is suspected she has PCOS, which makes it hard to get pregnant if not impossible in some cases, and i had to get a sperm count/test.   


Booked my test which the earliest i could get in was 4 weeks from when i called, fast forward to the day before my appointment i came into some oxy 40s, (my favourite ones, the old oxycontin formula) so naturally i indulged. The next morning i had my appointment and woke up early, and must have forgotten that i had my appointment for my sperm test and popped 40mg of oxy as my normal routine when i have a supply of oxy. 15 min goes by and i realize ""shit i shouldn't have taken that oxy i can never cum when I'm on it"" but its too late at this point i just have to hope that ill be able to orgasm since i haven't had any sexual activity for 6 days as required for the test.  


Get to the clinic, awkward as FUCK. Bunch of dudes waiting in the waiting room. Receptionist (HOT as fuck btw, which made it even more awkward) calling people up and handing them a container. She tells them which room to go in, all while guys that are finished producing their sample coming back into the waiting area with their container, with their sperm sample and placing it in a basket on the receptionists desk in front of everyone waiting. My turn, i grab the container and head into the room with only a lounge chair and a sink. Proceed to wash my hands and read the instructions, pull up some porn on my phone and hope for the best. Try to do the deed but of course can't reach climax. I can always get hard but its always so hard to finish when I'm on oxy, even from sex i can rarely finish. (good for my girlfriend but not for me, since i can fuck for hours when I'm high)   


At least 20 minutes go by, multiple videos and I'm fucking pulling on my member so vigorously trying to produce this sample and shit is just not working out. I'm thinking I'm fucked and just ruined this whole appointment, but I'm determined to get this sample so i continue. After about 30-40 minutes (lost count of the time) of masturbating in a public place high on oxy I'm finally able to orgasm and get the sample in the container thankfully. Clean up, wash my hands and proceed to make my way back to the waiting room with my sample. Give the sexy receptionist my sample and turn around and there must have been 16 or 17 guys sitting there waiting for rooms to open up so they can go do the same. Get to my car and take a look at myself in the mirror and I'm just sweaty as fuck, hair is a mess, face beat red. Looked like i just finished a workout at the gym. I could only imagine what the receptionist was thinking when i came out of that room when i was in there for 40-45 minutes hahahah. Busted up half of another one of those 40mg pills and sniffed it up for my reward before leaving back home. One of the most awkward experiences I've ever had in my life.  


Everything worked out in the end, but I really wish i had thought that one through and waited until after I produced the sample to get high, I would have been in and out of that place in 5 min if i wasn't high. LESSON LEARNED. Hope you enjoy the story of my stupidity.   


TL;DR I had to produce a sperm sample, waited 4 weeks for the appointment and got high on oxy before the appointment like an idiot and could barely produce the sample, took 45 min and was embarrassing when i came out of the room sweaty as fuck like i just did a 40 min spin class.

The film follows the main character through events in his life, outside of his control, that push him back into his former opioid addiction.
The theme of the film is battling a broader interpretation of addiction; not just drug addiction, but any form that addiction can take, wether that be food, sex, technology, etc.
Because the symbolic addiction used in the film is heroin, I would love to hear some of your experiences with battling your own addiction, your own shortcomings, or just your life story!

I've scored morphine sulphate and have been taking 200 - 300mg a day this past week. While it doesn't have the punch of oxy, it has given me a moderate, euphoric high that oxy seems to have lost with me.

I usually take between 80mg of oxy (minimum) up to about 180mg a day, and have been for months. I probably average 120mg a day, and I dose strictly after work (over a 4 hour period).

My connect can only offer me methadone for the time being -10mg pills and I'm about to get 30mg off him. Not that I'm interested, but I have to work and cannot deal with chronic WD right now.

So, for someone who's never done methadone before, can I expect to get high with that sort of tolerance? It's that or nothing, so at best it'll keep WD at bay for 36hrs, but I wouldn't mind catching a nice buzz, especially because I'm paying $50 for it.

For example, I get a nice warm high off 200mg morphine sulphate taken orally, even though the oxy equivelant of 120mg is barely noticeable for me now. I firmly believe that rotating opiates allows you to catch a high that you wouldn't get with your main DOC in equal conversions.

I'm wondering if the same applies to methadone seeing as the metabolite is different to oxy (which converts to oxymorphone) and morphine (which is the metabolite). I'm not even sure what methadone metabolises to, other than it is a full agonist with a crazy long half life.

Can anyone comment on the methadone high for someone who has a moderate to high oxy/morphine opiate tolerance? Will 30mg do the trick or should I get another 10-20mg?",1529907089.0

Now To save making two posts, I just encountered one of   those veins that are popped out, look ready for action, strong flow, but always fool you into missing..as in, fully registered, push in a little, backs up, still registered, yet you'd have to force it in. That makes thr littler veins near burn. 

Dk if it's thrombosis or what, it's not scar tissue and only happens to a few big ones. Akin to your blood having a secret tunnel yet your shot registers, then backs up with no where to go. Doesn't feel like your missing til you try and force it in.. Sometimes it seems to travel the wrong way, very locally tho. After damming, still pulling blood, it'll maybe Burn real quick telling me enough to find another dermal dope slide.  Its not hitting an artery, I know 100%

The missed part of the shot also absorbs like a fully successful shot there too... Always making me come back tricking me again. So its odd, frequent enough to ask about but still mysterious,  Lmk if veteran slam dunk contest winners know the answer....

More concisely, veins that register strongly, dam up, yet still are drawing, but obviously not going through the veins? Missed portions absorb more because its on top of a vein obviously, but it's stronger than that. Slowly injecting brings same result. Only on large veins.

1) don't do any sort of -isms, it's just not cool and i run a leftist room. your opinions are welcome but no personal attacks or nasty stuff about groups of people. if you want to be rude, get personal, there's plenty of stuff to say about people without going for low-hanging fruit.  

2) don't make obnoxious noises over the mic, or play music over the chat. the bitrate for the sound channel is like 4, everything sounds like crap unless it's played through the built-in youtube player.  

3) don't dox anyone or take pictures or record the chat, this is a place people come to feel comfortable doing various things and anything that violates privacy results in an instant ban.  

4) guests must pick a unique username. no lurking allowed because people stalk people and shit. aside from these, just don't be rude or a douche.

AMA about this at all no matter how personal your question may be, messsage me privately anytime if you wish, and please comment on this post with your experiences and leave feeback. sticky until the end of monday for visibility, heres the first step of a testrun of an extensive project weve got in the works for* r/opiates\*. :)\*

\---

I wanted to start a thread for people to share experiences with recovery using maintenance tools acquired without professional help. I see people mention self acquiring subs for dry times, but never have really seen anyone share long-term success using self acquired maintenance drugs. What I DO see constantly, is people desperate for help but lacking the resources for whatever reason. there is too much misinformation on maintenance drugs and success using them, i aim to eliminate that in any way possible. this is not professional advice but each claim i make is backed up either with firsthand experience or citable references ive found researching, this is not one size fits all so wlecome discussion or questions. please dont make any informed claims as facts, seeking a solid discussion and want this thread to be something to link people to in the future when questions come up daily about this.

personal background: I am a chronic pain patient and massive, chronically relapsing heroin addict. I have been clean from dope for 45 days self medicating suboxone illicitly obtained. Been on opiates daily for nearly a decade, using heroin for two years, suboxone is the only thing that has ever kept me away from full agonists. I have never been prescribed, cant afford to currently, and want to share my recovery experience having to cut corners to self medicate with the medication that has saved my life. I will share, and am open to answer any comments (or PM discussion is welcome, too) regarding:

\- advice on a short term suboxone taper

\- advice on long term suboxone maintenance

\- advice on suboxone doses relative to your specific habit

\- advice on different routes of administration less often discussed

\- also have advice for days on using kratom

I invite everyone to share experiences with maintenance methods outside of sub/methadone clinics and without professionals. I will add that you have to REALLY want to be clean in order to make this work on your own, because you will have to cut a lot of corners at times. But it IS possible even when it seems like its not and you are lacking traditional tools. I will touch on price range for suboxone both via prescription and via the streets; using atypical ROA to get the most out of buprenorphine; stabilizing on a dose as low as possible but yet reasonable; and I welcome any questions at all. *I cant speak on methadone as it is harder to obtain especially on a consistent basis illicitly. I personally reccommend people try kratom or suboxone before methadone, especially if youre lacking the funds to do so ""properly"". Anyone with experience on self medicating methadone feel free to share though*

**I want this to be a thread we can refer people to in the future that want help and dont know where to start without professional/medical help. Note: I am not a doctor, just a recovering junkie/chronic pain patient who wants to help other people in a bind with recovery using maintenance tools.**

**summary of my specifics and where im at:** When I ended my last run, my habit was using midwest beans of heroin/fent (beans are 100 mg capsules of dope), ranging from minimum 5 beans a day to 15+ sometimes. Mostly snorted, but injected 3-5 times a week or so. In the past I usually used the bernese method to induce, this time I waited til about 28 hours and then induced normally 1mg at a time. I get my subs on the street for $10/8mg. I use half a strip per day. I trade pills or even food stamps to my sub dealer when I have no cash. But speaking cash wise, I self acquire 15 8mg strips per month and it costs me a total of $150, or $5 per day. I never have 150$ at once, and I never buy more than a week or two worth at a time (though I urge you to if you can).

**Price range:** In the name of harm reduction to share info on resources in diff areas (broadly), as a mod **I will allow mention of states but** ***DONT COMMENT ANY MORE SPECIFIC***. First I am sharing street pricing. and AFAIK on dark net they go for like $20 or so for 8mg. I am in new york and they run $10 per 8mg here. I know that in tennessee they go for up to $25 per 8mg and Ive never heard of more than this. AFAIK, thats typical depending on region and how many you buy at a time. Ive never seen them for less than $10each, or more than $25 each. Ive heard of people selling fragments of a strip at a time, accepting trades as payment, etc if you cant afford to lay out lumps at a time. As far as clinics around me, they go as low as $100 a month cash for the visit. Uninsured, I had my pharamacy give me a run down on the prescription cost uninsured, using the biggest availabel discount plan or coupons. I inquired on 60x8mg, as this is the most commonly scripted amount per month. For the name brand Suboxone films, it would be $570. Zubsolv (5.7mg bupe sublingually equiv. 8mg) would be about the same. Subutex (buprenorphine sans naloxone) would be over $700. The cheapest option is generic buprenorphine tablets at $180. These numbers are all based on 16mg per day for 30 day cost, in my area in new york. This is on the cheaper end! Streets are flooded, dark net has them, and for legal/proper acquiring there are some sub doctors that are not horribly expensive out of pocket, and for pain people Pain Management doctors are starting to push bupe as well.

**Dosing/ROA:** I cut the supply needed in half by opting out of sublingual dosing. Sublingual bioavailability is around 30&#37;, intranasal like 48&#37;, rectal 56&#37;, IV 100&#37;. DO NOT bang your fucking subs people! But you \*can\* stretch and get the most out of buprenorphine  by snorting or plugging. I personally plug my suboxone every day, 4mg per day. My dose is the sublingual equivalent of about 8mg a day, but by plugging I can spend half the money on half the amount of strips by doubling the BA I would get taking as prescribed. I encourage textbook def. ""abusing"" drugs when it is for good reason! I spend $5 a day, even at $25 a strip this would be $12.50 a day. This holds me and keepps me stable coming off  a decent heroin/fent habit. Feel free to tell me your current habit and Ill help you find roughly the dose you could realistically stabilize on. Suboxone is WILDLY overprescribed, but I am grateful for that because the streets are flooded and this  allows me a shot at recovery.

I realize my specific regimen is not one size fits all, but having pretty extended knowledge (both through experience and through researching extensively) on ballpark dosing, on the most painless taper possible, on ROAs and dosing equivalents etc. There is a ton of misinformation on buprenorphine out there. You probably dont need 16mg/day. 90&#37; of horror stories coming off of suboxone youve heard are due to improperly tapering and jumping at stupid amounts. There are ways to dose it to make it better for pain. Its possible to induce even if you swear you just \*cant\* make it to 24 hours. You can do it on your own if you want it. Ask me anything on suboxone or kratom, message me if you want to discuss privately, share your experience with maintenance that you did on your own without professional/medical help. Lets shut down the incorrect info, discuss tips weve learned, share what hasnt worked, and give hope to people lacking tools and resources.

**\*\*\* OFFICAL DISCLAIMER you can mention your state in this context for harm reductions sake but no more specific, anyone using this thread to try to source in any way is getting banned\*\*\***

TLDR - my experience self medicating with maintenance to treat addiction and chronic pain, ask me anything at all on my experience or input, and share your experiences in the comments. looking for a helpful thread for discussion and information on a topic not discussed often enough. disclaimer im a mod and not welcoming rule breaking of any kind in this post.",1529892365.0

Pulled up to this BBQ joint in the hood (best soul food in the city) and grabbed some burnt tips, collard greens and grits. He opted for ribs and slaw. This is the guy who told me i need to quit doing heroin because its going to kill me. Call each other by our real names not our hustle names. He's struggling as a new father and asked for pointers cause im good with kids. Talked about the socioeconomic disparity in the black neighborhood he lives in and how it creates dependency on welfare. Discussed how disenfranchised the youth of today feels and how it probably ties directly into the opiate epidemic. Thats why he became a dboy, he wasn't making enough flipping burgers to support his mom, his sister and his girlfriend and child. Ive asked him before if he feels bad that people have overdosed from his drugs. Today he said to his knowledge nobody has died but when people disappear  he loses sleep over it. He himself has never done heroin and asked me how hard it was to stop and explained its impossible for some people. We're close enough since he knows im solid and not a snitch that i finally asked where the fuck he gets all the h from (not names or locations obviously just like if its a cartel or what). He gets actual heroin not fentanyl. He said his guy is an old OG Gangster Disciple and is the one one who gets it from the cartel and only once has he seen the cartel guy and he said it was an unsuspecting hispanic guy driving a cheap car. Apparently a key of heroin is around $30k of uncut grey/beige raw. The coolest part was when we got the check he said nah nigga i got you man cause lets be honest i've given him thousands of dollars and he also tipped really well. gave the waitress a 20 and a bunch of ones on a meal together that only costed 20.

After 10 years of usage, a single fuck up resulted in John’s parents finding out his secret and creating major hurdles in his recovery.","They found out. About him of course, but not me. I’m still in the clear...for now.

2 weeks ago John’s crazy ass went on a vacation with his father and brought ten 40 mg OPs instead of dope. (For reference, he usually uses ~20 blue bags a day.) Perhaps he might’ve been able to take the hit of a few sweaty days if he weren’t hiking-the-fucking-Grand-Canyon. But let’s be honest, this was a stupid move.

Anyway, I did what any good fiancé would do and I shipped him enough dope to hold him over. My biggest regret is roaming the hallmark isle of the drug store and refusing to settle for anything less than the most perfect, lovey-dovey, “my ❤️ is wherever you are,” card to ship it in. Sure, I changed my name and address on the return section of the envelope and didn’t leave a single finger print to trace it back to me, but this made for a lot of explaining when his father intercepted the package...The one thing we didn’t think of. 

John’s parents are your typical preppy, middle class, divorced white folks who drink a few too many glasses of wine at dinner and get a bit carried away with judging other people on Facebook. 

“HEROIN?! You’re going to DIE if you use even one more time!” 

“What a terrible father you are!”

“You don’t love us, or you would just stop.”

 ...Just some of the cringey things they’ve said that mirror every naive Heroin parent’s thoughts and fears. 

They don’t understand the concept of withdrawals. They don’t understand the difference between blowing/smoking/shooting...etc. They don’t understand the similarities in chemical makeup between H and prescribed opioids. All they know is what is portrayed by the media; which is that prescription pills are dangerous, but Heroin is a certain death sentence. They regurgitate this stigma like a bulimic teenage girl purging her 1st and last meal of the day.

Of course there is so much I wish I could tell them to ease their minds, even in the slightest....that John knows what he is doing, he knows what he is getting, that it goes through several other people before it reaches him, that he’s deathly afraid of needles and would never shoot up, that he is not out on the street copping from strangers with heavy Fentanyl or Carfentanyl cuts, that he is functional, that he is still a wonderful father, that he has been trying desperately to kick the habit and was planning on taking some time out of work in the coming months. 

Not that they would even believe me if I did tell them any of these things. These minor reassurances would only serve to incriminate me—if not as a fellow user, than as a (sic) “remarkable enabler.” 

Predictably, when John returned from his vacation, his parents sent him straight off to detox and then rehab. He did surprisingly well at first, completing his stay at detox and getting through his first full day at rehab (the rehab he was sent to was a separate holistic facility, about 45 mins away.) Problem was, he was not fully detoxed and now he was stuck at a place that did not have the means to help him. (They wouldn’t even give him a god damn Advil!) 

So like any other miserably sick addict would consider in his circumstances, he bailed. 

I had warned his parents about the shit-quality of the detox they sent him to. (Little did they know, I had been there just weeks before and failed miserably due to their inadequate treatment.) I begged them to choose another place, but they didn’t want any part of it.  Some former addict with a certificate in addiction counseling told them this facility was the best in the state and they believed him. John’s parents were all-knowing experts and I was just a foolish little girl, or so they thought. At this point they weren’t even really talking to me, actually. They believed I either sent the drugs myself or that he was cheating on me. Both theories made things incredibly awkward for me. 

When they finally came around and decided to include me in the conversation, the first thing they asked was who the woman was whose name was on the card John received. I told them I assumed it was a woman named “Jane” he used to work with who was head over heels in love with John. I suggested that perhaps he used her weakness for him to get what he needed. A stupid excuse, but it seemed to work for now. 

Much to my surprise, his father was on a witch hunt to track down our dealer. (What the fuck, man.) I’ll never understand his desire to want to destroy someone else’s life. As if it will somehow save his son.

Everyday for the last two weeks, I’ve received  a call from one of our friends informing me that John’s Dad called to interrogate them about tracking down “Jane” or whoever his dealer is.

Unironically, our state just passed Kristen’s law, (which for those who are unfamiliar with it, could sentence dealers to life in prison if caught). Mind you, our dealer is also a user like so many others and could use help and support far more than the kind of draconian punishment John’s father is seeking to charge him with. This guy is the kind of person who would hang himself if he were sentenced to more than a week in prison. He could never ever handle punishment this severe. 

I cannot put into words how angry this garbage legislation makes me. I called and lobbied for weeks trying to prevent this bill from becoming law, but sadly, too many politicians in our state are more concerned with appealing to the vulnerable and naive families of OD victims and getting re-elected, than listening to every god damn substance abuse professional and organization within a 50 mile radius of us who testified against it. It doesn’t help that this is a mid-term election year, (but I digress.) 

When John left rehab, his parents called me immediately and told me I wasn’t to let him come home. Um, what? Not going to happen. They were utterly PISSED when I refused to do so. His mom responded by calling me a “remarkable enabler,” making (technically semi-accurate) assumptions about my past knowledge of his use and going as far as saying “Fuck you!” to me, for refusing to adopt their “tough love” approach with John.

Whoa. Okay, so maybe I kind of get it. You’re both frustrated and need someone to blame and I am an easy target—much like the mystery dealer whose life you want to destroy. Somehow that still doesn’t make this any less hurtful and frustrating. 

I tried my best to explain to them that in my “experience” in dealing with addicts (my sister and mom are both addicts and I happen to treat addicts for a living), a more compassionate and shame-free approach is much more effective. I told them we should be fostering an environment that allows John to feel comfortable talking to us and that we shouldn’t be angry with him for leaving—instead we should hear him out and do our best to provide positive reinforcement and remind him why sobriety is worth pursuing. 

(But hey what do I know, anyway. It’s not as though I’m an actual addict. 😳) They argued that my approach has failed from the beginning—which actually isn’t true since I haven’t made a solid effort since MY tough love phase years ago and prior to picking up the habit, myself. The argument was going nowhere so I ignored the texts that followed, which involved nothing more than the two of them berating me for being so “foolish and naive.” 

When John came home that night, I watched as he blew 15 bags at once. (What the actual fuck, John. I’m trying to justify your irresponsibility in my head, but you’re not making it easy.) 

He looked up at me when he finished and saw me start to tear up. “You have to go back. Your parents are going to hate me forever if I don’t prove to them right now that I can—“ before I could even finish my sentence, his phone went off. It was his mother telling him “not to listen to me” and that I “don’t have his best interest in mind.”

That god damn text hurt us both more than it should have. “I know,” he said. “But let’s go get some food right now. I’m starving and I miss you so much.” 

He clung to me like a toddler, that night. We talked all night about our hopes and dreams for the future. We cuddled and cried and laughed until the sun came up...

He knew he needed to take advantage of this opportunity to get clean. After all, his parents were throwing down $15k for him to go to a top-notch rehab. And despite all of the weird holistic/anti-western medicine treatments they practiced there, he believed it was a pretty damn good facility, considering the typical standards of this industry. 

But first, he would need to go through detox again. Bleh! I think I hated the idea of him leaving me again more than he hated the idea of having to suffer through withdrawals again. But with 10 years under his belt and 5 under mine—we knew what we were in for. Suffering is simply unavoidable with this drug.

The next morning he re-packed his bags, we did some laundry together, grabbed a quick breakfast and I drove him off to another detox facility.

His parents were shocked to hear that he was going right back—so shocked actually that they apologized for their less-than-kind remarks towards me. It felt good to be the one to tell them.

Today is day 3 of John’s detox. I went to see him yesterday. He was visibly ill, but pushing through without med assistance. I think this time will be a bit easier for him since he did most of the work last week, prior to his single relapse. But we’re not out of the water yet and won’t be for some time.

As for me, I’m cutting back by 1 bag a day—which sucks worse than it sounds—but the plan is to taper down just enough to be able to pull off a 72 hr cold turkey detox in a few weeks when the tension with his family has died down. 

Keep us in your thoughts, y’all.

We can’t afford to keep dancing on the edge of this cliff...as beautiful as the view is, we have too much to live for.

Didn't even drink until my career exploded (in a good way). First drink I had was on my way to an event in Los Angeles, coming from a small town on a small island in Scotland this was just so wild for me. I had a vodka and coke and thought it was rancid and ruined the flavour of the coke.

Years later I get some chronic pains showing up. The doc gives me cocodamol. I joke to friends about it being a ""hardcore superdrug"". It's fun though... one night when a friend's dad died I went on a walk up a hill back in Scotland. Well okay a mountain that overlooked the rest of the world below. I was just stood up there taking photos thinking that even though my friends event is sad that at least he got to live a long life and got to produce good kids. I got back home and watched a bluray film called Nausica. Life felt good.

But of course that feeling is fleeting. I wanted more. Told the doc my pain was getting worse and was put on Tramadol. Now this sucked. It was providing so much reward and happiness in my brain that I stopped doing fun stuff. My fame was getting lost but I felt okay through it all. Ho hum! But then I ended up in a deep depression. I got out of it months later.

Nowadays I buy Codeine in large quantities from online pharmacies. I usually have 1-8 days worth in a single day. It's a bit crazy and even no matter the dose it doesn't get my high as it once did. I've been thinking about changing to a different medication but it's too hard to (semi legally) get oxycodone and its friends here. And the docs don't give it out either. Like... the route is Cocodamol, Codeine, Tramadol, DHC, morphine! I think end of life people can get Fentanyl. Always wondered what that's like.

These days I just live off my royalties from my previous life and spend too much on these weak drugs. I keep wanting to quit them. I quit Trams cold turkey once and oddly found it not too difficult... I just reminded myself that the only reason I felt bad was externally chemically induced and it would be okay soon. Weirdly easy like I say... But now I find I can not take codeine and everything is okay. Before I went all in I used to buy Loperamide as a replacement and found that worked absolute wonders. No kidding! It lasted longer than codeine, was more mentally happy. Just much better except for that super long peak waiting time. 5 hours for me! 

I keep wanting to come back to earth. I'd like to buy a ranch or something in America and be a liberal chap out there in the countryside/mountains running a bunch of studios where people can come in and create whatever they wanted. Or abandon everything fun and exciting and become a house renovator.

My partner supports me through all this. They're a great person. Totally straightedge (except in the bedroom) but also understands that my body is in a lot of physical pain and is more or less okay with as things are. But if I ever told them I wanted to quit they'd be there the whole way for me too.

I guess I'm rambling because I have no one else to talk to this stuff about. Everyone thinks I'm this wholesome person. I guess I am but theres also the fact that 1) everything hurts and 2) I get help with that. I feel like I'm retired now. I'm halfway to retirement age but have decided to take everything so slow and leisurely. I might even take a nap now. No, I will.",1529860695.0

I was freaking out... I remembered what my new friends from NA said to do, and so I reached out to another addict, one who is a friend from this sub that I have grown to know pretty well actually.

They picked up the phone and called me immediately. Cue a 4 hour phone call where they dealt with my stupid ass constantly doubting myself, saying I was waiting for a call or text....They assured me that I do have the strength to do this, and that I know it within my subconscious. They told me over & over that I am capable of living the clean life, one that after over 10 years of addiction just feels so fucking foreign to me.

One, I was thinking about my previous birthday. I had money guaranteed to come to me in a card, enough to buy dope as well as components and supplies for my hobbies and bike.

The thing is, I arranged for the middle to expect my call the following afternoon right after work. Though, I was also hoping that I'd wake up for work at 6AM and have the card and cash waiting for me. That would've allowed me to get the ball rolling that much earlier. I was owed half a bun the night before, so I squaffed it all up because I couldn't wait even though I could physically wait. 

&nbsp;

So then my family member who was giving me money, was up really late and went to bed not long before I woke up. So was just hoping that when I get off work nine hours from the time I woke up, that the card would be waiting for me. 


Now of course, I knew it would suspicious to come home from work, receive the card and money and then dart out the door again. If there were a any lingering doubts about me not being on the straight and narrow -- this would affirm such doubts.


&nbsp;


Thus I came up with a cover story which wasn't completely untrue. Said that I needed to buy something wholesome from a store that closes an hour after I get off work. My family member says, ""I'll give you a ride you if you need one, there's a chance of rain."" Well, I can bike to the shop to get the part I need, and it's good to have the bike with me to take measurements of the part I'm replacing but I had to think.. to take the ride or not. It would possibly look less suspicious, but would also impose delays into the whole process of procuring dope. 

&nbsp;

In the end I just had to play it by ear when I got off work and not be obvious in my true actions. Took a few minutes extra to measure my old parts before departing to go to the store for the new parts. Also warned my middle during the work day about the liklihood of delays on my end but that my order was a certainty, just a matter of when. 

That's funny, so many times when I've been told, ""it's just a matter of when"", I was being lied to by the likes of Cliff. Oh well, my middle knows I'm a straighter shooter than that.

**BTW the middle that gave me [""Jewish"" spices in place of dope](https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8sn777/requesting_help_in_identifying_kosher_seasoning/?ref=share&ref_source=link) gave me real dope two nights later.* That was two nights ago for that matter.

The only thing that annoyed me was the fact that I ordered that shit on a Wednesday afternoon and was now receiving it on a Friday night into Saturday morning at 3am. Doing dope that late fucks up one's sleep. Furthermore he didn't give me a five bags like I paid for, he gave me four and said he'll give me the fifth one later or in a couple of days.

Naturally did some right away and saved two for the following day of work. Since I took a nap right after work, I was able to take a sub when but I should've gotten my shit on Wednesday when I ordered it.


Of course that last bag... he could only give it to me when he middles for someone else or buys some for himself. Not worth my time to keep asking.

It's about a biologist who encounters a physicist working as a bagger for Walmart, his name is Johann Ritter. Turns out he was born in 1776 and has attained immortality, though the exact means through which he did so remain unknown. It's narrated in three different styles: protagonist (contemporary German), physicist (pompous, purple 18th century German) and the narrator, who happens to be the Devil himself! It's a Faustian type deal through which immortality was awarded to Ritter. Great book,9/10.

Also reading Suttree, by Cormac McCarthy of Blood Meridian and The Road fame. It's hilarious, biblical, poetic, EVERYTHING. Read it! Amazing prose, I've heard it described as a Southern Ulysses or a ""doomed Huckleberry Finn"", which is spot-on.

1) don't do any sort of -isms, it's just not cool and i run a leftist room. your opinions are welcome but no personal attacks or nasty stuff about groups of people. if you want to be rude, get personal, there's plenty of stuff to say about people without going for low-hanging fruit.  

2) don't make obnoxious noises over the mic, or play music over the chat. the bitrate for the sound channel is like 4, everything sounds like crap unless it's played through the built-in youtube player.  

3) don't dox anyone or take pictures or record the chat, this is a place people come to feel comfortable doing various things and anything that violates privacy results in an instant ban.  

4) that's basically it, just don't be a douche.

anyone is welcome regardless of beef and personal history so long as you keep it off the table.

For anyone who doesn't know, scramble is dope/fent mixed with...something...and put into gel caps for either 6 or 10 bucks. Two 6 caps or one 10 cap is a single serving. 

Well, the scramble is all I can reliably find in the area. And on the upper side of the binto an irritating issue trying to mix them in the syringe. No matter what I do, when I put the two together, they solidify somewhat! I've tried heat, no heat, mixing them in the same spoon, in separate spoons, pulling up the dope first, and pulling up the crack first. I don't know what else to try at this point.

So what I'm wondering, science people of r/o, is what ingredient in these two conglomerations is causing this (I assume) chemical reaction? I'm kinda guessing it's the baking soda in the crack reacting with whatever the inactive ingredient in the scramble is, which I don't know what it is. It apparently used to be quinine back in the day, but I doubt it's that any more. Also-I'm using grape kool-aid powder to break down the crack. 

It's still somewhat injectable even when it clumps up, I did and it went in fine and just left the solids at the bottom of the syringe after I shot the rest.

I'm about to score some coke with my dope. However, I've only done coke twice, and not injected. The hubs and i wanna try a speedball but i don't know how much coke to add. We typically do approx 1/4 gram of dope per shot. I know you can't tell me exactly how much coke to add, but maybe give me a ballpark? I'm only getting a gram of soft and like, 12 grams of d food.

And holy shit, am i thankful i did.

So it was a unique day for me, since we were recording our debut EP, so i  decided i should do codeine a bit earlier than scheduled because i was  in the studio recording shit and i couldn't concentrate to save my life.  I was planning to leave the codeine for a party i was having later that  evening, but since we were way off schedule i decided to skip it and  just take the codeine to make the most left of my recording session. I  filtered out about 1600mg of codeine (had some old leftover residue i  refiltered + 1500mg of regular pharm grade codeine w/APAP) downed 20mg  of citerizine and drank the codeine.

And holy shit

The  trip was intense, not as intense as the one i had from H, but needless to say - i was swaying left, right and could barely keep my  balance for a few minutes. I felt a bit of itchiness from the histamine  release, but nothing else much noteworthy - just an intense, euphoric,  pleasurable high which left me zoned out into music for a good 3 hours.

Even  my band member asked if i didn't get bored recording the same riff over  for 3 hours to get the ""perfect take"". Hah, got close. Was one of the  most productive studio sessions in my life.

And  before you mention placebo - i didn't expect anything, i was kinda  expecting it to be less intense than it was. Words cannot describe how  that 300mg improved my high. Maybe it's because of the dexamethasone i  took 2 days ago? But it couldn't have been that, since i took codeine  the day before this trip (first day of recording and setting up amps) so  my tolerance was pretty high, although i only took about 900mg and it  left me cranky and unproductive afterwards.

TL;DR the trip was way more intense than the usual codeine 1200mg i was doing. So, yeah. I disspelled the myth for myself and i will now be upping my dose of codeine to 1500mg. The high was so intense - i want to break my schedule of once a week and do it again soon, and that fucking scares me.",1529793229.0

It just isn’t happening. Too many days gone by spent high, too many bridges burned. Lately I feel like tossing my own urn off the old railroad trusses behind my house where I spend my best days, in high or sober ways.]

---

I once had the best moment of pure euphoria on the aforementioned railroad bridge after a serene walk with my best friend. (so long dude. I drove you away for good). I’m sure the fentanyl had little do with both, right? Yeah. Fucking right. The devil was inside my bones, but I felt better than I have ever felt. I felt invincible. I was the prototypical me, I created things. I was a master. I wrote poetry which would blow you away, and I didn’t even know where the words came from. I was applying for manual labor jobs, something I had never even tried or considered as a skinny ass emo/skater dude all my life. 

I was driving trucks even though just being in a car used to make me a nervous wreck. My family was happy for me. It looked like I had turned over a new leaf. I had stopped smoking pot, which was something I had done for years straight. It’s a possibility it made me lazier somewhat, I’m not denying that. When I quit I didn’t even do it on purpose, it was just that this other drug was so good nothing else mattered. Fuck coffee. Fuck weed. Fuck even eating real food, give me a fentanyl lollipop and some ice cream. That is all I ever craved food-wise was ice cream. It’s in a class of its own. (I’ve seen my own father who is on the same drug eat gallons of the stuff. It’s really a spectacle.)

I woke up one morning and realized I felt too sick to even get out of bed and reach for my fent patches, I had hidden slyly hidden under my audio receiver. In retrospect, what kind of hiding place is that? (considering I have an audio nerd for a father). There was not much logic going through my head in this period. However, there were many songs in my head. I wrote ballads that seemingly were beamed down to me from the nether realm, because I don't know where the hell those words came from. The notes just slid off my fingers while playing guitar too. It felt like cheating. “Now I know...”, I thought, “how all those junky artists created such brilliant things.” I had discovered the cheat code to life, and it was incredible. 

At night though things took a turn, I became alone and trapped. When my company was gone, which was rare during this time, I would just nod out on the couch watching adult cartoons through the corner of my eye every 10 minutes when I could manage to open them. I was fucking strung out like hell. I had a nearly infinite supply of the strongest legal for human use, opiod on the market. I was chewing those damn patches like gum, and my friends must have thought I was insane when trying to explain. “Oh it’s just a little pain patch, hehehe”… What a joke. Somehow these friends stuck by me, for now. They didn’t realize the scope of what I had done to myself as I did. I had become a full-on opiod junky, and the worst part of it was I was completely aware of it. It isn’t like the naive old lady who goes to the doctor for Percocets and becomes dependent. She hasn’t studied the exact psychology/pharmacology that goes into addiction. I feel like it honestly made it worse that I understand why* I was hooked.”All this dopamine I’m lacking here without chemical influence”, and another, “if only I weren't a treatment resistant chronic depression and anxiety case already before the junk”, all these justifications like this we have to continue using, they don’t mean shit at the end of the day when we lay our heads down yet again, an addict. 

One day my best friend and also roommate called me as he usually would around 7:30A.M. “Hey bro, you ready?” It was time for one of our early morning classes at the community college we were now attending. God knows I already fucked up the whole university deal. I had just gotten out of sitting in a bathtub, trying to calm down my extreme lack of temperature regulation. Sometimes during withdrawal the few seconds of warm water are your only refrain from the pain and agony.

 I reluctantly agreed that I was in fact ready even though I felt like death on a stick. I was testing out how sick I would get without fentanyl today. My friend pulled up in a few minutes, and I got in the car. He asked me for a drink of my water. “Wait, are you sick?”, he asked. My friend was a severe hypochondriac. “No, it isn’t that kind of sick”, I assured him. “Oh, well as long as you’re just dope sick...” Feeling like somewhat of a diseased leper didn’t seem to help my already unwell and agitated state. We drove out the loop of my blacktop drive, and I already had a bad feeling for what was to come.

We crossed the mountain via the great big interstate which connects our little rural village to the outside world. We are just simply a piss stop for the rest of the world, a cut off, isolated mountain town where everyone’s nosey about each other’s business, and the only actual businesses are pharmacies, Dollar Stores, and funeral homes. Oh, and churches of course. At least we do have God on our side... Except that we are all on doctored-ordered drugs (heroin isn’t huge here), beer or moonshine. I stare out the side of the passenger window at the beautiful mountains below and think how I used to get stoned on top of the hill right above this interstate and just stare down at nature. Man, I wish I could appreciate things of beauty now. Everything looks fucking grey, it’s all the same. That’s the worst part about drugs, and it’s the same with all of them for me (even antidepressants). They zap the color from life.

Finally, we pull into the exit. Now if you think my description of my town sounds shitty, this is worse. It is considered one of the poorest areas in the state and also the meth hotspot for our county. There is only one main road, and we drive it slowly as to not fall into the speed trap. I can feel my stomach starting to turn now as I cringe at the McDonalds sign above. “hey bro, you want some mickey dees?”, my friend asks. “No.” I say with a firmness I have never used before. “I’ll just eat my trail mix”. I brought some because I can’t go without breakfast ever, even while a junky. I scarf down some M&Ms and peanuts and raisins, while trying to calm my anxiety with the soft guitar on the radio, courtesy of The Shins. (I was the source for all my friend’s musical tastes, an expert in his eyes).

Now we are pulling into the school, and the dread is coming to a head. It floats up my stomach and feels like love butterflies in my chest except they are black and rotten. As we are walking in, I see this really cute girl that sits across from me in class. I smile at her as we both turn our heads back towards the front of the school. At this exact moment, it hits me. I have to fucking throw up and I have to do it right now. I’ve heard this can happen in withdrawal though I have always had an iron stomach until today. I rush over to the curb, not more than 25 feet from the door (and my crush  at the time) and proceed to projectile vomit all over the crabgrass. Ah, that feels better. 

I wipe my mouth, and scoff it off as I walk inside and head to my class. My friend is simply shaking his head, and I still don’t know if that girl saw me. As I walk into the narrow corridors of the community college, I imagine just how mundane this really is. There must be hundreds of little schools that are built just like this, with as many mediocre classes and teachers too. Hey, it’s cheap.

I turn right into a door that appears the same as every other, and I’m in my class. I look at the teacher, and she immediately knows why we are late. These bloodshoot eyes tell stories. I ask her for a piece of gum in front of the entire class, heavily implying that I just threw up everywhere. She told us to just go home, and so we did. 

---

Some more months of this cycle go by, as I slowly fall out of going to my classes, and then literally start falling out of life. My habit has gotten worse, fast. I’m now wearing and chewing fent patches, and rarely leaving the house for any reason. My friend and roommate is sick of my shit, and gone back to his grandparents. 

It was around this time I considered trying to get clean “for good”. I flushed all the remaining patches I had in a fit of rage. After this event at school and last night, I’m over it. I should explain that I fell out for the tenth time probably on the couch one morning, around 6am, after being in my usual nod state for the entirety of the night. I woke up to Hank Hill saying “damnit Bobby” and suddenly having to puke, as I gazed at my red hot foot right next to the space heater where I wore a patch or two. I probably had a piece of another in my mouth as well.

Fuck, my stomach feels like daggers are poking into it again, as I run dizzy to the bathroom, marking the very first time in my entire using career, even with future IV use, that I ever threw up from any opiod dose. I have a natural tolerance to all drugs somehow. As I sit in my sweat-soaked boxers, hugging and staring down into the toilet, I saw my pink and green stomach bile (the result of eating nothing but fucking tootsie rolls in the last day). It was around then I knew it was time for a change. However, little did I know change is hard to come by...",1529784628.0

For example this is my story. After I got out of the sober living, I moved into a new apartment with  one condition: that I get drug tested once a week. Fine whatever that’s life. Plus now I can smoke weed (drug test for the parents; piece of mind for their time/ the least I can do.)

Well, after about a month of doing the drug testing, I noticed pattern of some really lazy drug testing. So me being me I push it to the limit but I’m also freaking out because I’m taking a huge gamble here. What do I do? Well, all the research online regards to drugs in your system really emphasize the idea of being healthy and exercise. So that’s what I did; started right then and there. Thankfully I pass the test and I felt like a cheated death again. I attributed it to the exercise and eating. Every time I used after that I was extremely afraid of what might happen drug test thus the exercise and the eating; I’m kind of nut health-wise. Stop smoking. Took up yoga. Shit like that. My parents even acknowledge how good I was looking and started taking health tips from me the junkie.

Here is the kicker;I just found out that the tests I take are the new five panels! My DOC is oxy so even if I rolled in high I could have passed that shit. I got into shape and found a new hobby for nothing!

Serious tho it’s one of the few times this addiction as actually helped me. Nothing like kicking will doing your flow!",1529774580.0

Now ive been chipping for 8 monthes bc legal reasons and i was completely sober for a couple of monthes and 4 monthes off benzos and  bud and was passinf testes and probation let me go with psych care n no drug tests because i passed them all. Cant get anything better than tapentadol maintaince and 20 5mg oxy rarely prescribed. Being young with nerve damage, 8 mental conditions. I could try to get into pain management but in aus its extremely hard being young with nerve damage from a bike crash which i didnt go to hospital for bc circumstances around it so not much documentation which makes it hard to get into. Then theres methadone for pain so i can actually function daily or oxy/h which are expensive and illegal which could put me in jail for 20 m. I appriciate medical use and rec abuse and im trying to find the best solution.

Tldr: chipping oxy and methadone for nerve damage and to function and get on with get into a high paying job. This is an oncoherant xan ramble but let me knoe whay ypu reckon. Methadone or weed and benzo script or go through hoops and get fuck all from pain management. but i just want to move on with life after abit of mental and physical trauma plus ptsd, gad, depression and mild bipolar(current diagnosis) n a few more things. Any one who can offer advice go for it. From aus btw and if you have a fair bit of know about pain mgmnt or meth/suboxone id love hear from you

Actual tldr: thank u xanax
Option 1. Get into pain Management some how and it give an honest crack to get reasonale xr meds for medical use
2. Go to a methadone clinic and get a decent dose for pain, find decent dose, get shit together then taper
3. Dmn
4. Bud with low dose methadone.

I took 400mg DHC (non-extracted), I didn't even fucking nod. Minimal euphoria, and felt like puking the entire time.

Either the 'ceiling dose' theory about codeine is bullshit, or DHC isn't as strong as people say.

So I go to the needle exchange and one of my using buddies pops in and still goes through a dealer I used too a long time ago. So I took him to meet the guy, paid my buddy a pack of cigs and a tiny shot for reintroducing me. 

Spent $40 and got just short of a half a gram,  split it into two shots, did one and was pretty high but I only had one shot left so I picked up four clonopin 1mg and took them on the ride home. 

Get home, do my shot (around 2PM)  and my god I was ripped, my girlfriend had to even help me walk. So fucking amazing.  

Now for the bad part- I didn't realize it was fetsnyl so I was withdrawling bad around 4PM. I didn't know how I was going to get more becsuse I forgot to save that dealers number (even though I'm sort of glad I didn't becsuse even if the shits fire I prefer something with legs) 

Fast forward until night time

I was dope sick all mfing night,  shaking, sweating, can't sleep, puking. 

Dealer is out of town for FOUR DAYS I was like wtf am I gonna do? Other dealer wouldn't answer at all. ***fuck***

Then a random number texts me AT 4AM! saying ""Jay left me his stuff to sell""

I said can I come through now she said yes. 

I wake my girlfriend (who doesn't do dope at all so she wasnt happy). We lesve around 430AM and get their around 515.

The girl selling the shit was already waiting outside for me. Normally i pay $40 for a half but I got two half grams for $70 this time. 

Normally it takes me forever to find a vein so if I'm really sick ill muscle, but I found a little vein by my thumb and hi

Not the greatest stuff,  didn't have me nodding crsxy but it gave me that amazing eupboria, energy and my favorite part THE ITCHIES (not even sarcastic I loveee itching) 

I also love the taste of the dope you get in the back of your throat from the dope (you know what I mean)

We came to get some water and a couple burgers, but me being the little idiot I was back then, decide I want to shoot up right there in my car, and Robert says he is also down to shoot right then and there. So I break off a piece of the beautiful tar, as black as a freshly paved road, shinny and almost clean looking, and I drop it onto the bottom of a Arizona Tea can. I mix it up using the plunger on the freshly opened syringe. Just stirring gently as the thick tar melted into the water. It didn’t take long, and when it was nice and mixed, I dropped my little piece of cotton into the dark liquid. I stuck the needle into the cotton, and sucked the liquid into the syringe. It was a beautiful golden brown liquid filling half of the 1 cc syringe. I was ready to rise up to heaven.. 

The veins in my arm are hard to raise, and I hated dealing with trying to tap into them. I also was lucky enough to not really scar, I was careful and never left easily visible track marks. For these reasons, I opted to use the veins in the back of my hand to tap into. They were close to the skin, and easily accessible. So, I have Robert wrap his hands right around my wrist, to act as a tie off. I grab the steering wheel of my Chrysler, and slowly slip the needle into the perfect little vein. I pulled back the plunger and saw the dark red blood flow into the syringe *yes!* I thought to myself, because I got it perfect on the first try. So I slowly push down the plunger, and have my friend release his grip as I do. Instantly I feel the warm rush, like a tidal wave, but instead of cold ocean water, it’s water that feels warm, and smooth, better than any thing you can imagine. I have had some crazy drug experiences, and some crazy orgasms, even both at the same time. But nothing I had ever experienced could match this rush. It was pure bliss, like being sucked into heaven and embraced by god himself, I had reached nirvana, the perfect shot, the perfect high, until it became too much. The rush didn’t stop, it didn’t peak, it became overwhelming..

Robert had to grab the syringe from me, and look at me asking if I was okay. All I could reply was “I don’t think I can handle this” I was not overdosing, I was still conscious and breathing, but the high was so intense I started to fade in and out of consciousness. Let’s not forget I was in my car, in a busy fast food parking lot, and now I was so intensely high I thought I was going to die. Suddenly I see two cops, male and female, walk right by the car. This female police officer was one of the toughest looking ladies I have ever seen. I was so relieved when they kept going and went inside of the building. Now from here is where my memory gets hazy..

I some how managed to drive (yes this was very stupid, I could have killed Robert and myself and I regret that I did this) to Roberts brothers apartment. We get there and he gets me inside and I immediately start to apologize and explain what is going on. They are actually very understanding, I think a little annoyed, but understanding. They told me I was just too high, and that I would be fine. This reassured me, but I was still feeling waves of extreme eyeball rolling euphoria, it was amazing, and scary as all hell. I ran to the bathroom and immediately throw up. I don’t make a mess thank god, but I throw up a lot. Once that stopped I went and sat down on a small couch they had in a side sitting area, at this point I start to nod off, and literally lose giant chunks of time. This is hard to explain so let me try..

I was sitting there, and my eyes would close, and i would suddenly wake up and it’s 15 minutes later. But it did not feel like I was just falling asleep or nodding off. It literally felt like I was dying and coming back to life. I know I wasn’t actually dying, but all that was going through my mind was that my heart is stopping, and this is going to be the thing that kills me. Well, after a couple of hours of this, I start to come down, and calm down. Once I am back to reality, and can grasp the fact that I had just done to much, and was too fucked up, I apologized to the brothers, and once sober promptly left and went back home. I swore to myself I would never do something like that again, that it wasn’t worth the risk and that was that..

..3 weeks later I had a needle in my hand, and once again felt the serene pleasure of the warm evening sea rolling over my body.

He still thinks 5 years ago was months ago, the last run in we had. He worked the music store for his musician friend. Gary was broke and lived in a camper when single.  Now all his money is in mandolins. Even when he retired, 35 thousand dollars he spent on  One mandolin. His wife paid the mortgage, Gary still had the same paint stained tennis shoes I remember in 2006. His wife chases me away after 5pm, Gary hides his vodka,here. 3 martinis before dinner, bed at 730 She says. She doesn't want him drinking. He was barely alive in the soul when I realized he was my neighbor. His wife was my least favorite of my mother's friends. Cunt is an understatement.  So we act like teenagers irking her uptightness. I bet she only danced at her wedding.  He always asks how my hands feel, that surgery must have had a long rehabilitation and physical therapy to play like  I was never injured.  If Gary could see better or remember daily, my tracks would be blatant too him. I'm learning jazz guitar. He's learning jazzy dead songs for me.  My work causes my other scratched skin I say. We play my originals and he noodles along. He talks about touring,  how he could arrange for bringing me along. That would be a dream come true, unfortunately, Gary's main musicians all have passed. He talks about doing open Mic nights, then always says the dog needs a bath that night. Last week he assumed his kid and I grew up together. I've never met him.  Always Remembering 15 minute long arrangements without sweat, forgetting the year the next moment. Gary prioritized his memory storage.  He's off his opiates now.   So I nod along to spare him explaining again. His wife knows my mom. She thinks I'm still young. She tells on me and tells my mother I smoke weed and drink.  Gary is letting me drink.  Gary doesn't smoke,  but his fingers do on those frets. Our little jam sessions are smoke shows, too bad no one is there too listen.  Some days I have to board the coke train to keep up.  We play any thing he can remember. His wife works up stairs doing cyber therapy sessions.  She's so rigid and uptight, we both always agree this here in the sun is bout as good as it gets. No therapy needed when u have this. That's the smirk Gary always has. That's why he doesn't need those opiates. I need his secret. Gary doesn't work or tour anymore, its been decades now. He was always the hired help. So many tour stories about wild parties and drugs mention He was left out. being married and only a drinker, not hip enough All his life he played rock and roll / country mandolin. Bluegrass is the main genre for that instrument. The masters like David grisman were so epic, He was stuck in his niche. No originals wrote, no hits.  He's damn content now that he has someone to jam with. So  my lyrics and chords are the songs.  78 and 2 months ago he had reserved to let go. could barely move. Now he's got color to him, not taking his opiates and out and about. Gary thinks I get scratched alot at work. His wife tells the truth, he doesn't buy it.  So when the sun is shining, my 80 year old best friend hangs with me on the porch. Drink martinis, we try and learn those bluegrass legends solos, play songs, and forget we both need opiates. He needs them for dieing, I need them to keep from wanting to die. Not suicidal, just not impressed. Open mics and occasional jams around the fire can't mask the taking. No giving, people take. Scum bag fiends who want something always, or girls who need attention. Jobs that are dead ends, jobs where promotions cause hostility and petty people threatened shit on you. Opiates. Keeping the monotony at bay. Here's to every one finding a 78 year old bff. He only wants me to play guitar, and pour another martini.  Its funny how a habit sets to pause on that porch, every where, and everyone else, dance for a few minutes then ask for what they need. Gary's my homie, and straight with me. ""What are ya waiting for? I'm dieng so lets get pickin"" .....I oblige him and realize I dont have a habit here on this porch.  I'm clean to him and this is all I need.

Things that help along the way.  Xanax is like gold. When you can’t sleep or when you’re just craving something it really helps. Also Constantly take 800 mg ibuprofen every 8 hours or whatever the bottle says. Drink plenty of water. If you’re into weed smoke plenty. Now this last one is going to sound a little strange but it really works for me Bc I’m the type of idiot who has to withdraw at work...(8-10 hours of lawn maintenance a day). For some strange reason or really helps me to have some dope with me. Not that I’m planning to use just to have in case I need it. It gives me peace of mind and also helps me get through the day Bc I’m not constantly thinking about the next time I’m gonna score. I know it sounds weird and it’s a lot of will power but before you know it the minutes are hours. And then you’re at lunch time. That’s where I’m at now, which I think is pretty good Bc I started trying to come off dope on Wednesday and I’ve managed to get to lunch Wednesday, lunch Thursday, and all at work today. Of course I went and scored right after work but I already bagged it all up for next week and only smoked a little to see how potent it is. Oh also for anyone wondering I snort it and occasionally smoke it to test potency when I get a new batch. I’m not sure if my method will work for shooters. Or anyone besides me really.  But... I already feel better and going through a day of manual labor in the sun while withdrawing and not using was an amazing feeling, knowing it was right there if I needed it. Every hour that went by made me feel like a stronger person. Even though I had it right there with me. I have no idea why but just the thought of having a bag with me just in case helped me tremendously. I didn’t get sick except towards 6 this evening I was yawning and eyes watering and some of the beginning signs of withdraw. But instead of using the bag I took with me to work I added it in with the new stuff for next week. And I already bagged it all up so I have to go through the next 2 days withdrawing. I hope it works. That I’ll slowly be able to withdraw with way. Let me know if you have any pointers or constructive criticisms or words of encouragement. Be safe out there y’all!

I strictly regulate my use, and have been able to for almost 10 years. If I'm using heroin, I can keep it to once every three days. If I'm using something which hangs around a bit longer (e.g. methadone), I keep it once every week. I've been able to avoid a physical addiction since I first began using in my early teens. Withdrawal was hard, but it ended after a few weeks.

I have treatment-resistant depression. I have tried almost every single psychiatric drug out there, with little help. I also suffer from periods of extreme panic attacks which can last from a few minutes to weeks or even months on end (seriously, it's hell). This has seriously derailed my life, and has cost me a significant amount in terms of relationships and my education/professional life.

When I'm high, that all goes away. I'm highly productive, I'm happy, and I'm generally a much more stable person. I have friends who are stabilised on methadone, who after many years still find it extremely effective in reducing their anxiety and depression.

I am seriously considering upping my usage in order to develop a habit from which I can then transition to a legit methadone script. Prescriptions are cheap where I live, funding this is not a problem. I figure, if it enables me to live the life I want, I can always come off it later. Withdrawals are bad, but even methadone has nothing on month long panic attacks. I know because I've experienced both.

Naturally as an addict being compulsive is in my nature. I use fentadope and mostly do not experience WD until 8 hours after my last sniff. However my last sniff is usually before bed and is at the end of 1,2 hell maybe 3 grams. When I first relapsed a couple months ago I was totally new to dope and fentadope, oxycodone was my DOC two years ago before I went on suboxone assisted therapy. For the first few weeks 2g lasted me two days, now if I’m lucky 2g lasts me one afternoon/night and a morning dose.

I just can’t help myself from doing totally unnecessary sniffs every 30-60 minutes. If I am going in after a few hours without a sniff .2-.3 of “fire” fentadope is enough to get me real good. Then I do a bunch of .1-.2 and before I know it I’ve blown through a gram and the .5-1g I meant to save for the next day.

3) don't dox anyone or take pictures or record the chat, this is a place people come to feel comfortable doing various things and anything that violates privacy results in an instant ban.

Unfortunately that's all he has but I'd like to be able to get something out of it, since shooting coke on its own is nowhere near as blissful. So I'll be shooting both and filtering with a micron filter. But with my suboxone use, would I get anything at all from the 40mgs oxy? What if I take a day, maybe even 2 off? Also, I've only ever used heroin in the past, and I had a monstrous tolerance, so does that change anything or is my suboxone dose really all you need to know to gauge the strength of 40 mg oxy?

I’ve been IVing MDMA crystals lately & coming down with xans. 

The rush is not as good as good coke or Dilaudid, but it’s pretty dope.

You feel it immediately, but the peak of the rush takes around 30 seconds & last’s about 10 minuets.

Much like coke, your heart stars pumping pretty hard, and you ponder if you should call 911 before you die. But around the 45 second mark, most of the anxiety goes away and you start rolling balls. Then you feel social.

The peak is short, around 45 min, but the comedown is a lot smoother than if you were to take it orally. And the high feels “cleaner”.

I’ve just been chilling watching anime with my lil bro & playing Dragon Ball FighterZ/fortnite.

I know I’m killing my veins guys, but it’s okay. I’m getting some more micron filters soon.

RIP my serotonin receptors tho lol

Had started off with the roxies (green 15's, blue 30's) 4 years ago snorted my first 30 and fell in love ... fast forward 2 years and once the oxy habit was at 300 mg a day I knew I had to go a cheaper route , my cousin told me about a dude who had fire tar and that would hook it up since he is a family friend. Took the offer and bought 2 g's of Black I knew nothing about , I knew you could smoke it or shoot it but I didn't know how. I asked my cousin to help me out and she said half nodding out "" just rip a fat chunk and throw it in a visine bottle"", "" add water half full, then drip drop it down your nose...slowly"" I was like wtf? So I tore off at least a .4 and stuffed it in the visine bottle shook it up till i had pitch black liquid , tilted the head back and HOLY FUCKING BALLSACK i just felt like I snorted a line off the devils dick! It burned so bad but after a few more drops in each nostril I was feeling warm, fuzzy , and euphoric. Nothing like the oxy but still good in its own way it got the job done and it lasted me a good while at first. Now two months go by and my nose is raw as fuck , and it's not hitting me the same anymore ( tried smoking it numerous times and almost threw up, hated the fucking burnt taste ) so I hit my cuz up and ask if she would be willing to shoot me up, she refused and said "" I promise you , you'll regret it"" and hung up. Called again this time offering her a half g and about a gram of hard i had got chunked plus cash for driving 100 miles to drop off dope. Needless to say she was at my place in 15min. The crack must have been superb because she said she heard the train lol (she shoots hard by the way how? Idk) anyway after she got right she loaded me up a .4 and had narcan on stand by she walked me through thoroughly step by step and told me she was only showing me once. She hit me right on the side of my wrist below the thumb and once she pulled back I could barely even see blood register it was so dark but when she pushed down .... it took my breath away , instant taste of vinegar followed by a pins and needles feeling that brought me to my knees ... I swear I creamed my pants a bit after lol that's how good it felt . Then shit just got out of hand from 2016 up until the end of October last year , over dosed 4 times , all times brought back by narcan. My veins in both my arms are completely shot and I have a gnarly scar where I had a bad abcess they had to slice open . My neck veins feel weird and kinda hard in some spots from shooting in my neck when I couldn't hit arms or legs...

8szo6w,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8szo6w/question_about_switching_to_buprenorphine/,16,https://redd.it/8szo6w,WeirdOneTwoThree,Question about switching to Buprenorphine,"I know I’ve been really stupid: I’ve been dosing fentanyl a couple of times a day for a long time now, I don’t even really remember just how long when I really try to. It took me a long time to accept that I was dependant (strangely it seems my mind didn’t want to let me believe it). Once I came to know for sure I was and there was nothing I could immediately do about it I searched for a cheaper way to stay well out of economic necessity.  I really couldn’t keep buying pills and heroin (I was using both) for much longer without suffering financially.

Looking back I really wish I hadn’t been so smart and stupid at the same time because of course all I really did was kick the can down the road and make an even bigger problem -- It still has to be dealt with. I know that one gram of fentanyl lasts me about 2 months and I’m into my 6th gram now so has it been almost a whole year I’ve been stupidly kicking the can down the road? I seriously find that really hard to believe yet the math can’t be lying. I’ve come to the conclusion that however long it’s been it way too long and definitely time to do something about it. 

I never dose enough fentanyl to cause euphoria, just enough to keep me well. If one does dose enough to cause euphoria it is really very disappointing (compared to just about everything else) and you are also very close to an overdose (just a very few mcgs away) so I don’t ever go there anymore and haven’t in many months. My understanding (and experience) is that this isn’t the case with fentalogues (substances similar to fentanyl, many created to avoid the schedule of controlled substances which doesn’t help any more now there is the Fentanyl Analogues Act). I also do the same thing with other substances, like heroin and pharmaceuticals, not dosing enough to cause any euphoria but just a maintenance dose but I must admit that with heroin (and certain pharmaceuticals) it is just too tempting not to push just a little more (on some rare occasions) if one is having a particularly bad day and take a very short opioid induced vacation basking in the warm and wonderful euphoria that heroin and a few other select substances can obviously provide if you dose enough :)

My wife has no clue and with each passing day it gets less likely I’ll come through this without her finding out about it but I still hold out some small hope this will be the case and I’m really afraid it will destroy our otherwise really good marriage. I would like to try to go to NA meetings but can’t as my wife is smart and would likely line up the times I wasn’t home with the meeting dates and times :)  Also I never lie to her (obviously I don’t tell her everything) so if she ever were to ask me directly I’m pretty sure I would have to tell the truth.

I’ve done (literally) many days of research into buprenorphine maintenance therapy and I think it could be a really good fit for me. I’ve communicated with lots of people that use buprenorphine and found out a lot of information, some of it that many Doctors obviously aren’t aware of. Like for instance, I ""know"" after much research that buprenorphine won't do it for me and my stupid fentanyl addiction (many have warned me not to even try), so much so that I'm not even going to try “directly”. When the day comes (and it must come soon and really can't come soon enough) I will have to switch to something else a week (or preferably two) before trying to switch to buprenorphine. I've communicated with a good number of people who tried to switch from fentanyl to buprenorphine, even at the maximum dose many were **”very sick and confused”** as to why it wasn't working when the their Doctor told them it would but apparently it simply won't because it can't. There is something about the pharmacology of fentanyl (somehow related to the lipid solubility) that causes it to stick around for several days (even though the effect has long since worn off and the person is well into expected natural withdrawal symptoms (scoring 12 or greater on the COWS scale) and then cause **brutally more severe precipitated withdrawal** when buprenorphine is introduced. Now that the time is near and I am getting ready to turn the page on this I realize that there are still a few more very important questions I forgot to ask.

I haven't used any fentanyl in a week now as I have been doing a trial run replacing it with heroin (to ensure that my intended approach is still practical) and that has worked out. 

Even though I was using fentanyl, I have found that I can manage well on about 3.5g of ECP heroin per week. So I figure if I get about 7g of ECP heroin and use that for a full two weeks (3.5g/week max) before switching to buprenorphine I should be OK as after two weeks since I used fentanyl I won’t be switching from fentanyl to buprenorphine, rather I’ll be switching from heroin (or whatever else I can get) to buprenorphine.  At least that’s my current “plan”.

There really are no other heroin users in my area and I know this to be true because the lab that the authorities use to analyze seized drug samples has never been asked to analyse heroin samples from my area (I read their annual reports), there is just no heroin around me (except what I have from time to time and I buy it 1500 miles away in another city I travel to often) and of course there are obviously somewhere around me must be a few more secret addicts who wish to remain secret and are obviously doing a good job of it :)

So is 3.5g of ECP per week a lot?  Have you used this much and been able to switch to buprenorphine with manageable withdrawal symptoms (e.g. symptoms that could still be hidden and unnoticeable to those around you)? 

One other question also occurs to me: If I were to be unfortunate enough to end up in a severe precipitated withdrawal scenario (to spite my best efforts), can I dose one opioid or another to reverse it or would that only make it worse?

Thanks so very much!

Did I finally get a JJ moment?,"I posted a couple months or so ago asking y’alls thoughts on trying my guy’s IR morphine or sticking with his OCs because of the price differences ($3 for morphine 20, $8 for OC20).

Took the plunge and ordered both. I liked the morphine in a different way - it’s great for the pain at night, when the sedative effects are a non issue.

Last week he shipped my next order, a mix of OC20 and OC80 (price per mg much better for 80) plus 60 morphine. It was coming from overseas but was scheduled for delivery later that week. I was running low on meds, so when delivery didn’t happen as scheduled, and then tracking stopped  by end of week, I panicked. I ran out over the weekend so the last three days I’ve been battling withdrawals, trying to keep them at bay with some loperamide. 

In touch throughout, he sent me a reship using a less expensive service yesterday, Wednesday morning, and also added additional product to compensate for the reduced shipping service. I didn’t even expect that, but wow, I was already impressed. 

Then this morning I received an email that read: “Good morning HMT, it appears miracles do happen. Your original order is landing soon.”

I check tracking and it was out for delivery, and the doorbell rang about 30 minutes later. I couldn’t believe it. I’ve never had a JJ moment ever before, and thought they were elusive as hell. I was a little worried that it was all a set up, surely this was a controlled delivery. Alas, it was not.

So not only did I not have to wait any longer for my meds, but I’m also receiving a double order. I offered to pay him for the second order and he declined. 

Im so happy to share my JJ moment! I see them posted all the time and get so jealous of y’all when I run into hurdles and could use JJ. I can’t believe I actually have a JJ moment to share!

I've been in and out of the court system multiple times because of two DUI's and minor pot charges. Back when I was 18 or so I had got into xanax and kpins pretty bad, sniffed dope a couple times, and did all your common painkillers and shit like that. I OD's on heroin in my parents basement around this time, because I had ate a few kpins and snorted about a half gram. My friend was smart enough to get my father, and my father tried CPR on me and then called the rescue squad. This event was one of those things that just sits in the back of your mind always. My dad brings it up and reminds me of it when he's explaining how much he loves me and doesn't want to lose me, if anything ever happened to me.

I OD'd again at a friends house, and was lucky to have a friend go get narcan and hit me with that. I got pretty heavy into my dope use around 19-21 or so. I was somehow able to get off of it though. I didn't use suboxone or anything like that to help me. I was just able to stop. I really don't even know how I did it being completely honest. But here I am, a few years later. Been sniffing everyday for atleast 4-5 months... honestly, it's been alot more than that, I just hate to think about it. Probably been using daily 7-8 months now.

The worst part is, atleast to me that is, is that i've also started to bang it. It hasn't got to the point where I absolutely have to shoot it, and can't snort it, but I just never thought i'd be shooting it. I never had anything against needles or anything, I had just always snorted it and that was fine with me.

I'm tired of being like this and honestly really want to stop. I have lost probably 30 pounds, I don't hangout with alot of the people I use to because I'm embarrassed, I'm just not the same. I'm still a hardworker, and a good guy, it's not like I have turned into a scumbag or a degenerate, I'm just tired of having to get high to feel ""normal""

I've been through plenty of counseling programs and all of that type of stuff- from all the court mandated things. They were all drug treatment programs. So please don't tell me passages or something like that. I really do want to get clean, because I know for a fact that this is the worst I have ever been about using.

I have had the ability to have it everyday, but it's to the point, where I go throughout the day, making sure that I will have some when I wake up in the morning, and all that shit. I absolutely hate it. I have been thinking about the vivitrol shot, but to get the shot you have to be clean. I don't think I can go the amount of time to get clean to get the shot. The place offers a 5 day detox, but it's 7 grand. I'm going to see a subuxone doctor next thursday, and i'm sure I will get the prescription, but that's honestly not even what I wanted to do.

I honestly just want to be strong enough to go the 3-5 days of god awful withdrawls and uncomfortableness, to beat it myself- but it's so much easier said than done. This is my first post so I'm sorry for being a noob, but i've been a long time lurker, and needed somewhere to go for help...

I went to rehab almost 3 years ago and have been clean for the most part since then.  When I was using I did about 3 30mg pandas a day.  Had a huge tolerance.

Recently a friend of mine went to rehab and got a bunch of strips.  He gave me one, and I proceeded to cut it into 8ths and took one sliver of it.  Needless to say I absolutely wasted from it for over a day.  I’ve managed to do it only every 4 days.  But it completely rocks me when I still have over half of the original strip from last week.  

I guess my question is, is this normal?  I know I have no tolerance anymore but aren’t these supposed be abuse proofed with naloxone?  I took 1/8th at 1pm today even now I can barely even type this post out.  It’s taken me well over 20 mins and I keep nodding out.  ",1529636371.0

Help?! :(,"Hey all. I'm up early tomorrow so I really need to fall asleep soon to be fresh when I wake up.. But I'm absolutely bursting for a piss, however because of urinary retention I can't. I can't sleep when I need to pee so badly. 

What could I do to help? I've held my breath and pushed, I've tried it from many different positions, I pressed my lower stomach and gooch, I had a tap running, hell I even dipped my ballsack into warm water for 5 minutes.. I simply cannot pee, and it sucks! :(

I would appreciate any tips you might have since I assume most have you have gone through the same thing at one point",1529629123.0
