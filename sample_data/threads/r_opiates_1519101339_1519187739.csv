It was the grievous poison of the thing I chased hardest and hated most. I sat on the step into the bathroom and smeared the droplets of dark blood down my arm. Perspiration formed on my temples and along my uncombed hairline while the caustic fumes of chemicals floated hot out of my throat. A stampede of antelope ran through my head, and my eyes shook. My jaw tried to unhinge itself but settled to cock itself sideways and hung crooked off my face.

I stood up. Greasy cargo pants hung raggedy off my skinny waist. A dingy shoestring pulled two of my belt loops together. Panic stricken, I stood in the middle of the room with odd posture, one shoulder slightly stooped, and swayed. There were six more grams on the bathroom floor. I swallowed them, six bindles wax paper and all.

The shot of cocaine opened an invisible portal in my room that night, and the screeching whistle in my ears turned into weeping and wailing moans of tortured souls. Dark voices breathed out murderous threats against me from the other side of the abyss. Or maybe the voices were coming from the other side of the chain-locked door. I couldn’t tell anymore.

I jerked to the wall where the light switch was. The voices morphed into intelligible banter between cops over hand radios about me and what I was doing as they planned their raid. My hands fumbled at the switch. The lights went out.

In the dark, demons crawled through the portal and into my head, through my nose, eyes and ears. There was an urge to puke. My heart beat too hard, like it was going to explode, like always. The shadows of feet stepped back and forth in the crack of light under the door. Pablo was in the room with me, and he had come to finish the job. His hand touched my arm.

I turned the lights on. My mattress, bed frame, the dresser and night stand barricaded the door. It was supposed to help me relax while I was high, but now I pulled the furniture off the wall and walked out of the hotel onto the street.

I found Leticia, at work. 

“I can’t close the store yet Riley. It’s too early, but if it is slow, like it is now, I can close early. I’ll take you to a sober house. Don’t worry.” Her face focused on me. She had fallen in love and wanted me to get help, but the shine of cocaine evil in my eyes put her off. We had never talked while I was that high.

So he's not actually a dealer, he's a middle man. Friday I dropped off $ to him at work and he was supposed to bring me the stuff later, and then he somehow lost it. So he owed me two, and then I had to buy another one on Sunday because he didn't have any money to re-up. So now he owes me $300 and is not answering at all, he ghosted me. 

So, I have met him at his work and his house so I know where he works and exactly where he live, I have texted in few times saying just give me my money back even if you don't have it all at once you can give it to me in installments, still no response. I'm about to send a text that says if you don't respond to me as to when you will give me my $ back then I have no choice but to come to your work. Should I send that text?

So basically I went into rehab on 28/12/17. When I came out, I started living with my best mate, who isn't a user and never has been. In all honesty, I've been smoking a fair amount of weed, and I've had a couple of drinks with meals (never had an alcohol problem at all) and up until now I've only had a few mild cravings over the last few weeks.

Today, my mates son got taken into hospital, and he's been out all day leaving me alone in his house. Now, I'm seriously struggling with the willpower to not jump on my bike and go get a bag.

It would take me all of 30 minutes to go for a cycle, score, and be back here smoking it. But deep down, I know it's a terrible idea and I know I don't genuinely want to do it.

How do I get the thought of scoring out of my head? Is it a bad sign that the first opportunity I've had to score, I'm seriously considering doing it? I know someone on here must understand where I'm coming from. Thanks for reading, any advice is welcome",1519141785.0

I've had opiates before but they never really did anything for me, and I didn't really care about them. This time I found that when I take one, I get a nice, calm, centering high. I just feel relaxed, and kind of normal. Like the sort of static-y rough edges get smoothed out. It's nice, and so far I don't feel as if I need to do it all the time, and I also had some stressful stuff happen to me lately and it didn't make me want to run to the Norco either.

I guess what I'm trying to get at here, is is it possible to use opiates without being an addict? Is it possible to be an occasional user?

I don't want to become an addict, and I'm very aware of how many people have said ""I never expected it to happen to me"", but at the same time it's the first time I've found something that I can do to feel relaxed, the same way that people describe weed, or alcohol - drugs that do nothing for me. I'm no stranger to drugs either, I've done many, but I've never really enjoyed any of them all that much. They're either too much, or the side effects / come down are god awful. After I get off the high the only thing I think is ""boy I don't want to do that again, it sucked.""

Used kratom for a little to help myself get off H. Shit has been going great in life ever since. This past Friday I picked up some dope as a  little reward for myself, especially since everyone in my house was leaving for the weekend, so I wanted to just veg out and get high as fuck. 


Anyway, does anyone else get rebound anxiety when using? This whole weekend, my anxiety has been through the roof - actually, when I stopped using, that was one of the main positive differences I noticed, I got my anxiety way under control. However, this weekend, my anxiety has been increased 10 fold. Not when I am high, but when I wake up the next morning, and for the rest of the day, I can just feel myself on edge and very anxious. 


Does this happen to anyone else? I love opiates, but this was one of the main reasons I stopped my constant use. I'm kind of mad at myself I copped this weekend, but hell, I may as well finish what I have left or else it's just gonna be like flushing money down the toilet.

I recently went away for a few weeks to visit family and old friends, and despite my opiate use my life just seemed really great and I just felt really dynamic and confident after that.  So I came home and updated my Tinder profile.. and it worked!

Got super liked a couple times over the weekend!

BUT, before that, I get to meet this sexy little freak tomorrow!  Getting a hotel room in town and going to tear that pussy up!

because i am on suboxone i guarantee no doctor is going to fucking help me UNTIL i actually need surgery. how fucked up is that? why do i have to go under a knife in order to obtain something to kill my pain?

ive tried over 20 different medications that dont work for my pain

now my parents have made me so afraid of going to see the doctor , by giving me feelings that he wont help me because i am on suboxone . 


i went on suboxone b.c. of my pain, and the fact i was pretty young and didnt want to really go through the process of obtaining opiates via  neurologist . 

it worked well for years

but now even when raising the doseage i feel no pain relief whatsoever and my pain is so bad i can no longer talk.


contemplating suicide to have them admit me to the ER to have my pain treated. as they most likely wont admit me any other way. 

would like a social worker but idk if i can afford it
need help

and its not even due to lack of opiates, i actually have several different opiates, but i dont want to play around with shit like that. i need a doctor to actually help me. i do have an appointment, but like i said im scared of going because i have no support. what is the point of going to just come home and be in more pain and repeat the same routine that ive been doing?

my mother and father are pieces of shit that would rather me be in pain , than have a prescription to something that may help. my parents are pieces of shit. suboxone helped me and screwed up my life at the same time, but thats mainly my parents fault. 

I was never really addicted to opiates. Suboxone was meant as a replacement to vicoden and oxy, not to keep me off opiates. though now my parents are using it in that method when i have not touched another opiate in 13 years even though i have tons of them . 

So IG my plan is to quit suboxone and start taking dihydrocodeine for a while until i can get treated and my suboxone from the prescription monitoring falls off the chart in 6 months. I do believe that i have 6 months of codeien and dihydrocodeine. so it should work out.





*should i visit neurologist now or wait 6 months until suboxone falls off prescription monitoring chart?*

*will he actually help me while i am on suboxone?*
(ive taken so many meds, i will most likely have ulcers soon. i dont want another 100mg of diclofenac and somas. that shit doesnt do a lick of shit really for the pain i am experiences. it takes me 2 soma or robaxin, 2 tylenol, 2 diclofenac 100mg , 0.25mg of klonopin, 4mg suboxone and distillate just to bring the swelling down. 

and i am taking that every day for  over 4 yrs

so i guess my parents would rather me have a hole in my stomach, than allow me , someone whos almost 30, to have an opiate in their household. 

Meanwhile, Suboxone is like 10x stronger than morphine, with worse withdrawal effects, and doesnt kill pain nearly as well.

It made me a lot more confident, but unfortunately the stuff I got SUCKED! I still have one bag left from last night. It tasted chemicaly but didn’t do shit. Plus it had white chunks it in. 
So I found out that some random guy I met the other night is actually my dboys dad but everyone calls him unk. He’s super fucking cracked/methed out, but he’s also super cool. 
I went back to Unks house to get some blues instead but Unk was pissed. Started yelling and 7 guys ran out of the house ready lol. Unk is yelling about how little mike sold me some bullshit and how hes not going to get away with doing that shit from his house and how he’s selling some bullshit while he’s inside shooting the good shit. Lol. At this point so many people are yelling and walking back into the house that I only heard bits and pieces. I guess I’m not the only one he sold bs to. When Unk came back with my blues he promised me a g to make it up to me. He also gave me $4 and told me to give it to my daughter and tell her it’s from papa (which is what she called my dad who passed 4 years ago.) so I think I’m going to take it as a sign from my dad to stay away from this shit. 
So it sucked but at the same time it’s probably for the best. I think I’m just gunna have him give me some blues instead. ",1519096472.0

I felt pretty okay, but I had a paper and a midterm today, and as we all know, trying to find the motivation to work/study when in any type of withdrawal is miserable. I have ADHD and take Concerta for it, and I took 5 times my regular dose last night to get the motivation/focus to study. Naturally  I got a grand total of 90 minutes of sleep MAYBE.

However, my paper turned out well, and I aced my International Finance midterm. After my last class I made the 2 1/2 hour drive back home to cop a g and a couple more subs. I snorted some of It, but I only just now got back into my house and did a fat shot. 

I feel fantastic, partly cuz of the dope, and partly because the past 6 days is the longest I've gone without shooting dope in over a year. I almost always end up cracking on day 3 or 4, So it's nice just to know that I CAN go that long without shooting dope. And what's more, that I can manage to be somewhat productive if necessary. Last semester I was spending 3k a month on dope, and driving 160 miles back home to cop like every 2 days. Now I am actually feeling like dope isn't worth the inconvenience. Idk if I'll use over Spring Break, which starts the 2nd of March, but I know I'm not going to until then.

I know its long but I really need opinions and I cant take it anymore. I'm not one to beg but I just need some more knowledge on what I should do about this or what is even going on.

I'll start from the beginning. My crippling anxiety/social anxiety started in Late Middle School as a young teen. (I'm now 20) I would only get anxiety in random situations, and over the years up to late high school it progressed and got worse to full on anxiety all day everyday. The anxiety I feel/felt is purely physical, my body would be freaking out but in my mind I knew/know everything is completely fine.

This made me isolated, and couldn't keep friends because I couldn't go out or do anything without having panic attacks or feeling like I was going to die. It honestly felt like my body was holding me back from who I truly was. I had many doctors and psychiatrist appointments and tried almost every SSRI, SNRI. None helped they either made it worse or gave me horrible side effects.

This continued up until my senior year of Highschool when I tried an Opioid, Oxycodone. I already know people are going to say ""Well yea of course you feel better you took a opioid"" But it wasn't that. When I first took it was almost like something clicked. I felt More compelled to go out and talk and to make more conversation, I actually wanted to go out and do things. I was more active and had no body anxiety and felt the closest thing to ""normal"" that I had in years. I called up friends I haven't talked to in months and talked to them for hours which never happened. Obviously when you have been tortured by anxiety for almost your full life you want to continue feeling normal so I continued to take Oxycodone. And My life absolutely changed for the better.

1) I was actually able to get a full time job and hold it down.
2) My first time in my life I was able to have a relationship.
3) I was happy and anxiety free and was able to be myself and my best.
4) I actually would be out with friends more than I would be home.

*But the thing that really is important and weird to me is I wouldn't need to take it everyday to keep these effects. I would really only take it maybe twice a week sometimes I wouldn't take it for a week or 2. But seemed as long as I took it at least once every other week I was fine. Which makes no sense to me because Its not like I was high on a drug all the time it was almost like gas for a car like I would do it one day and be good for awhile which leads me to think it could be a chemical imbalance of some kind

Things were so good while I was in that regime that I 100% believed I had conquered my anxiety I felt like a changed person and things were great. And so I decided I wasn't going to take Opioids anymore. I just didn't want them to be apart of my life anymore So I stopped. And everything still was good I was still able to go out, my anxiety was non existent, and I felt fine this continued for a month and then I started to feel subtle hints of anxiety slowly returning. Only thing I can compare to is like running an engine with low oil (Oxycodone being the oil). It just slowly kept getting worse and worse until I broke down again.

Now its a year and a half later. I have lost my relationship because she said I'm not the same, I lost my job I hang out/talk with hardly no one. (I'm not trying to make anyone feel bad for me and don't want anyone to feel bad for me I just want to get across how drastically my life has changed) I still haven't touched any Opioids or any drugs because I been trying to naturally work on my anxiety but it seems no matter what I try or do its still there which leads me again believe it must be some sort of chemical imbalance or something that cant be naturally fixed.

I have been up countless nights staying up to 3am doing research looking for answers on what it could be the only things I could dig up is a possible Dopamine Deficiency ,Opioid Deficiency or an Over Active Fight or Flight Response.

My questions are:

What do you think is wrong with me? and why do you think taking Oxycodone every other day or every other week drastically helping me.

What could take to get back to where I was?  I thinking low dose Buprenorphine, A Long Acting Benzo, Or a Dopamine Agonist/Dopamine Promoter or a Stimulant.

I'm really at a cross road because I know Buprenorphine can lower testosterone and effect libido and sex in my life is important to me, A Benzo long term and wreck havoc on GABA receptors
And become virtually impossible to come off And a Dopamine Agonist/Dopamine Promoter can be dangerous and make things worse. But I just want my life back I want to be happy again.

I’m not an opiate virgin but I’ve done some codeine and tramadol. Tramadol actually worked heavenly for me when I did it. I’d take a pill, then cut up and snort the other one. The rest of the day I’d sit in bed nodding off etc. 

I’m really ill today (food poisoning) and was thinking to get OTC co-codamol or something easy lol. Because of this, I started to read up on painkillers for fun, and tried to do some research on how to get tramadol. It looks pretty easy and cheap to get.

Then I went on here. Sounds like a path that I shouldn’t go down. Like, even though I haven’t done that much, I fantasise sometimes about finding a box of tramadol so I can spread out the pills and have some ready for when I feel like it. Not really sure what I mean here but I do imagine it.

Because I’ve felt how good it feels (I undoubtedly know my 2 tramadol pills doesn’t equate with stronger painkillers) I feel like I can sympathise a bit with you guys. It’s a fucking great feeling. If I could feel like that all the time without the negative consequences I would. But I hope whoever is having a bad time with opiates and wants to quit gets put on a good path.

I'm scared.","Right, so I've picked up some Tramadol out of curiousity and have used 200 and 250 mg respectively in the last two days. My only prior experience with opiates was with codeine. 

My issue is that I've been having these weird fits where my eyes just sort of start going out of focus and I have an urge to close them and kind of nod. After I open my eyes again I have to ""readjust"" them to see properly. It feels almost identical to when you're sleep deprived and start having microsleep episodes. This seems to happen only when I'm in a sitting position and trying to focus my vision on one object. For example I was on the metro and this kept happening every few minutes. 

I've googled this and I've started reading about absence seizures and Jeavons syndrome and now I'm fucking terrified. Is this actually what's happening, since tramadol can cause seizures? Or is it just the ""nodding"" of tramadol? As I've said, this feels almost identical to microsleep episodes, and I haven't slept much this week, but I wasn't really sleep deprived today as I've slept about 8 hours. 

Please share any advice or experience you have, because I'm getting paranoid about this. 

Edit: I should note that during this nodding phase I've also had something which I would almost classify as CEVs. For example I had a vision that a person was standing in front of me on the metro, and then I realised that my eyes were closed. ",1519085560.0

Well most of my life has been a dark time because of mental illness, but one year ago I discovered my personal rock bottom. (Albeit not as bad as most of the ""rock bottoms"" described here in this sub.) I had cervical cancer, uterine polyps, and endometriosis. I had a hysterectomy surgery (which wasn't the bad part) and my doc put me on Percocet. That's around the time I started lurking in this sub and flirting with the idea of trying H. Like I said I was in a dark place. 

A little background, I was born addicted to meth so I avoided drugs that weren't prescribed by a doctor. However, I was prescribed practically every psychiatric drug in existence, since I was just a kid. I was on Adderall for 20 years. Klonopin 8, Xanax 2, you get the picture. 

My fiancée's drinking problem had reached a climax and she started beating me. Eventually she would leave me for a married woman with kid, shortly following my surgery. Between the surgery and her departure, I was the victim of police brutality after I had a PTSD flashback. My doctor called the cops and they showed up in riot gear. I didn't even have pants or a bra on. It was just a real shit time for me. My PTSD was getting worse and worse, I was stuck in these memories that were eating me alive. I was screaming at myself to stop them, sometimes in public. I had to leave my dream job, (where I was actually making a difference in the world) because of many reasons, but mainly because I literally couldn't hold it together mentally. (Also a coworker touched me inappropriately.) I was suicidal and I thought to myself, 'fuck it, I may as well have some fun before I kill myself.' I started abusing my percs and potentiating it and lying to the doctor for it. It wasn't long before I was looking for it on the street. Anyway. I had been reading this sub for a while and someone wrote a post about doing H for the first time. You all were begging this person not to do it. Well, I heard you. I made a deal with myself. First try to get better, then if that doesn't work, kill yourself slowly with drugs, or fast. Whatever. Just one last ditch effort. 

My doctors, family and friends had been pushing me to do this outpatient rehab for mental illness for a while. I said I'd try the program. If it didn't work, who cares? I'd get some H, get high a few times then end it. 

 Well, I just graduated from that program on Feb 9th. I haven't had a pill since. I got help for my mental illnesses and I'm medicated (gabapentin and Baclofen.) Better yet, I'm back doing what I love (zoology) and I am working on getting published again, and making real contributions to the scientific community.
