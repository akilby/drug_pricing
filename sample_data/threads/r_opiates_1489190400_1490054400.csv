Anyway, the other night I did a hit with H and crack, snowball we call it. Now, I've been an IV user of both these drugs for many years and have never experienced anything like this.

First, when I was mixing up my shot in the normal way, for some reason it didnt go clear like it normally did, it went all thick and sticky, like syrup almost. I'm in the UK so we have to add an acid to dissolve the H, I added a little more acid and more water to the shot and in the end managed to get it to a consistency that I could draw it up into the pin. Now, any normal person would have thrown the shit away, oh no, not me, I shot it. First off, my heart rate skyrocketed to somewhere I've never felt before, then my vision started to go blurry and my eyes rolling in me head, my legs kept on giving way and I couldn't speak at all, nothing except nonsensical slurring.

Now, it wasn't the crack as I was shooting that all day and no problem. This batch of H I had just picked up and it was the first shot of it, so it has to be that. If anyone has any idea what it was cut with, I would love to know as this was a horrible experience, never felt anything like it before. I was thinking maybe ketamine or something like that, I don't know. 

Anyway, I was ok in the end, after a while my heart rate returned to normal and my vision returned and I was ok, but damn, that scared me.

Keep safe everyone, peace.",1489231146.0

My phone was going nuts in my fuckin pants, vibrating hard, jiggling my balls like i was sitting on one of those foot massagers you see at the state fair.

A 30mg bullet just shot up into my skull at what felt like fuckin 700MPH.   My boy god Damn near spit out his strawberry quik.

Hydromorphone also has a higher ba (50ish%) oral and snorted vs 27% rectally, ideally dilaudid is iv'd but some have no interest in that. 

My question is what opioids are good for plugging? If not these two, and for obvious reasons fent and suboxone arent practical. Oxymorphone (opana) is too rare so it's not applicable either. Definitely not plugging codeine or propoxyphene lol",1489216491.0

But idk man, I've been getting some 30 MG ABG morphines (the purple ones) and the other day i railed one mixed in with my 30mg roxy. 30mg of oxy doesn't do much for me these days besides chill me out but I was nodding HARD. Just did one more with a 8mg dilly and feeling nice too. I've read that they gel up when you try to crush em, and that they're useless insffulated but idk. I suck off the purple coating, dry it good, crush it and snort it like I would a roxi. The result is more of a flakiness as opposed to straight powder like a crushed oxy, but if you chop it up much like you would fishscale coke, it's very loose and snortable. Doesn't clog up my nose much, and definitely has an effect. 30mg of morphine alone won't do much for anyone with a tolerance, but when mixed with other opiates or done it higher dosages (I have another 90mg chilling so I might do them all together without any other opiates to test) they seem to work. Has anyone had similar experiences? I swear, sometimes despite bioavailability and research, somethings get you high when they just shouldn't on paper. Any one ever got any rec value out of this?

I have no other outlet. My boyfriend is a recovering addict from snorting heroin.,"I mean, this was hell. He stole from me, lied ab just ab everything, hid his H from me, until I found out (which didn't take long at all...) & then that's when it just imploded. He was completely dependent to the point the withdrawals led drinking which led to detox which led to suboxone therapy which things actually for a slight small moment started to get better, and then I found out he lost his job..... An amazing one I might add. He's so smart, has a Masters degree!! He's not some lowlife guy who never graduated HS (and I'm not bashing the people who haven't btw, so please no focusing on that.) - (And I know he's already going to use ""for fun at times"" again, but has told me it'll be under control this time........and because I'd be the one administering / control it..) -_- Anyway.  (Oh and he's also a recovering alcoholic, which is what tipped the edge over (this time) into detox). 

Not many know how it feels to literally watch your significant other, who you love more than ANYTHING, have done just about everything you could possibly do for them, deteriorate in front of your eyes and there's nothing you can do about it. Absolutely nothing. They chose this drug over you MULTIPLE times. It feels like all the time - because it basically is. I just can't even begin to describe how that makes someone feel. 

Now - I'll let you in on something. I'm a drug user myself - in fact, I love them! The only difference between me and my SO is I have the ability to stop or only use as needed / wanted and be fine & he doesn't. So the fucked up thing, is he does all these horrible things to me and puts me through hell for months, steals from me, lies to me - oh mannnn did he lie to me - I stick around because I love him and know who he's who I'm supposed to be with (I'm 28 and he's 35), so we're not some young kids. And I'm devastated watching this. But on the other end of me wanting him to be clean, I want to keep recreationally using. But that's not fair, is it?

I shouldn't have any right to get mad when he talks about using or want to use when I'm supposed to be his support system of staying clean.....when I want to use. BUT I DO! And the fucked up this is, right now, when times have been tougher than EVER before - and I need to be there for him and supportive and obviously sober - I want to just get constantly 'gone'.  I don't wanna deal with anything. I want to escape. (Quick side note - I can't take opioids because I'm allergic and get violently ill that I never could even get close to getting any type of ""high""'off of them - so more my style of using is weed, Benzo's, mdma, 5-APB, etc. but on the other end, MDMA or any drug relating any of those effects won't work on him bc he's on SSRI's - so we're on complete opposite ends of what we can take - which is why him using is a big deal to me bc it's only stuffy that will get him hooked again, he can't take the 'fun drugs' - but I can......) but back to the story. 

But how can I talk about wanting to escape and take all these drugs and still get mad at my bf when he says the same thing? I know it's fucked up. Idk. But right now he's jobless (trying to get a job yes, and has told me not to worry, typical bf stuff to say to the gf to calm her down so she doesn't freak out - which I may have a few times...), and all I want to do is use...& I should be staying strong for him. So fucked ...Anyways I just had to type that out. So if you read this, you're awesome. And any thoughts or comments are welcomed.

PS: I wish no one could get addicted to drugs and we could all just get fucked up randomly together and never have to worry about getting hooked. That would be awesome. Ok I'm done.

I'm I'm my late 20's, have a 10 year history of recreational drug use, during that time I tried to limit myself because I knew from my first experience with prescribed codeine at 16 that this was absolutely my thing. I always had limits - no more than X times per month, I would purposefully not seek out my own contacts to limit my access. My first experience with addiction was in my first serious relationship. Long story short, I didn't know the deal (in my family, a 3rd glass of pinot noir is a party, a 4th would be reckless), I got sucked in, and witnessed all of the horrors of the 'typical' destructive addiction story. Lying, gaslighting, stealing, rehabs, wondering why he wouldn't just stop (lol! I had NO idea). 

Anyway, I left him & considered it a hard learned life lesson that opiates were dangerous and incompatible with happiness. I met my now-husband, and he made me question that for the first time. He was happy, working & saving money, but had essentially been using mostly morphine (short stints with smoking H, sometimes taking breaks, etc) for his whole adult life. At that time, he was on suboxone maintenance, because he wanted to save up as much money as he could to travel. 

We're really similar, and neither of us had felt shame about our love of opiates before, but it wasn't allowed openly either. Together, that quickly changed, and we kind of dove recklessly into heroin. I think we spent almost 2 years using daily, spent all of our money and more, you guys know the drill. It a wild roller coaster, I never knew that kind of contentment & joy was possible, or the desperation, the hell of WDs, the sweet relief of scraping just enough together to secure another few days of dope, the excitement of hustling. 

So things got pretty bad for us financially, things felt dire. We tried maybe 4 times seriously to quit, could never make it more than 3 weeks. But we had this dream of leaving our town & travelling, it meant everything to us, we promised we would do it no matter what, and we did. 

We spent our last month in town converting a van, building our own camper basically, and we got our of town with a last ball of H, as many xanax bars as we could find, and maybe 20 suboxone and much less money than we intended to have, but enough. I really felt like I was protecting those last savings with my life, because it was my lifeline. I was watching our money dwindling, terrified because that was my window to escape, and if i let it close, I'd be out of options. When we left finally, it felt like an all-out white knuckled bid for freedom. 

And it worked! 4 months into this new life, and we've finally settled into a warm sunny tropical place we love, getting jobs now to save up more travel funds, I feel like Ive been living in a dream world. Life was so hard for a while, but the feeling of not HAVING to have a substance to be normal is great. Life is anything but boring. 

Here's where I'm torn and I need input: things got crazy back home for me, yes, but in reality I didn't alienate anyone, I didn't hurt anyone but myself, didn't lie, steal, or lose my job. I had two lines that I told myself I wouldn't cross (needle use, and treating anyone the way my 1st boyfriend treated me), and I didn't. 

It feels like I'm kind of between two worlds. I don't know anyone on the other side of a habit who doesn't talk about drugs as if they're shameful. I don't feel that way. I don't think there's anything inherently bad or good about drugs, I think that people act according to their boundaries ultimately. I would do most anything for a blissed out few days, but I had limits that I would get sick rather than cross, and I did. I only hurt myself, and I don't regret anything. 

What's the deal? People in 'recovery' would probably say I haven't hit bottom yet, and to come find them when I'm really done (heard so much of this stuff while with my ex)... But I don't want to accept that. It feels like accepting that I don't have control over my life, and I think that's a bunch of bullshit. 

I have a hard time with where I am- not currently using, still processing my time as an addict, entirely intending on using again in the future, can't identify with the sober community. Even before my personal experience, AA creeped me out. Am I being an idiot? Or are there other people out there with this experience? 

Sorry it's so long, I'd appreciate some insight from others. ",1489167362.0

I only started doing drugs when I was 22, I'm 27 now, quit using all forms of drugs when I got on the methadone at 25. I was given heroin (raw & powered in a capsule and told it was a work out enhancer), until I was addicted and the person who gave it to me kidnapped, raped, tortured me until I was rescued at 7 months preg. My first child was his baby... but I placed her for an open adoption so I am still in her life. After having her, I went on a drug rampage trying everything I could get my hands on for nearly 3 years until I got pregnant again. I got into the methadone program, had the child and placed him with the same family so my kids can be raised together, and both be in my lives with the same fam. The parents were well aware of my issues but still love those babies with their entire beings. They were trying to adopt for 7 years but kept getting turned over. I initially wanted a same sex couple but they were Greek and so was my first child on her Father's side. Anyway... a few months after the 2nd birth I was weak and forlorn and depressed but eventually... I decided I was never going to do drugs again. I got the semi-colon tat on my inner left wrist (on the right side edge of the wrist, but the tat is facing me still), above all the now healed cuts up my inner forearm up to my elbow that I made in high school (was also a cutter-but havent for 12 years). Then, last summer after getting my life together as much as one can on methadone, I had a spiritual awakening. I've read Eckhart Tolle's ""The Power of Now"" since I was 18 over and over, and one day it finally all hit me all at once in this huge realization. I became enlightened. My awareness deepened and I lost the compulsion to think constantly. Untill then I figured I'd be on methadone forever. I was afraid of the intense withdrawls everyone raves about online near the end of the detox. But after that moment... I lost the fear completely. So of course I started to detox.

Now... I'm at 8mg down from 90mg when I started. I've been going down 1 a day since I was at 24mg and I'm perfectly fine. When I first set out I'd have to stop at 6-8mg bc the reduction would almost always trigger some light withdrawls but honestly it was the worst near the top of the dose. The only time I have somewhat substantial withdrawl issues is during my period, for which I take clonidine round the clock(LIFE SAVER) honestly if I didnt have that, the withdrawls during that time of the month would kinda suck more, but as I got lower in my dose it got easier as I went. What I did experience at first when I was still at 50-40mg and up was REALLY intense drug dreams. Either trying to find it or trying to administer a shot. I would wake up and realize where I was, surrounded by my room and 2 cats and everything that has come into my life now that drugs are out of it.

I'll be drug free in 8 days. I cant tell you... cant describe the pure freedom I feel. You dont realize how much you become the drug when you're addicted. As I type this I'm sitting at my easel, since I started painting and drawing again with my new energy, playing with my cat and the lazer pointer too. Not worrying about where I was guna get my supply for the day. I was very successful before and that allowed me to travel all over, so now I'll be able to do that again (I was self employed before so was able to keep work and my addiction separate) The day I finally feel the last bit of withdrawls cease is when I will get a tattoo of the Ohm symbol (🕉) in the place on my inside right wrist only on the left side of the inner wrist so both of them are opposed to one another in the same place on the wrists... one to remind me of the day I decided I'd never do drugs again, and the other for the day I became enlightened and walked away from methadone forever.

I'm going to write a book about what has happened to me; none of which I regret bc I wouldn't be ready to become an awakening coach and truly live without fear. 

Much love to all. I hope that if even one person is moved by this and makes the decision to walk away as I did... its possible. Even for someone like me who would mix meth and heroin in the same shot like it was nobodys business (and that was just to get the day started) well its possible to come back from that. Back from hell... and whole again.

Alright, let's be brief. I'm just another one of those guys that's trying to touch inspiration, and get out of a life of secrets and live honestly again, knowing the highs will be higher and longer. And I've been there before after a drug habit, but I had to run out and recover that way.

Ok, quick background. I first discovered opiates in about 2010, on and off usage until in 2013 for the first time ever, I realized the dosages accustomed to offered lower returns. GOt really out of control and then in 2015 lost my job AND my connect and had to detox at home---I'd say it took me a good 2-3 months to get normal energy back, and a few more to become a greater human than I've ever been before in terms of energy, activity and health. Had that power until about August of 2016 when supply came back to me again, and other than a 6 day pre-arranged supply shortage while I was on vacation in December, I've been a daily user up to today. I should point out that for the past month and a half, I've noticed my beautiful hair falling out fast, which forced me to get a cut I didn't like, and it still continues fall out, looking bizarrely inadequate. So, I'm trying to get clean because I want hair, and not to look bald and unhealthy. But also because I want to live a life of energy and reaching for stars. My habit was 75-110mg oxy a day during this second rodeo, but I've been stalking sobriety, meaning I've been strategizing the murder of this addiction with all types guerilla warfare, including keeping my stash in my car trunk so I'm forced to get out of bed and walk to the car (sometimes incomprehensible in the morning) if I want a hit, and of course, over the past 2 weeks I've whittled the usage down to 35-50mg a day in only 2 doses instead of multiple doses. Today I took only 27mg in the morning, about 11am and didn't take anything else until almost 11pm! I didn't even felt like I needed it, but I did it to get a bit of a rush of energy so I could watch a TV series I enjoy...can you believe it? But I stayed within my new taper down range, but still feel guilty that I could have skipped that dose. 

I guess I need someone to keep me accountable and just talk me out of doing stupid things like that. I notice when I avoid dosing at work, I'm just so much more agreeable and supported and I want to keep this going. The pressure in my life right now is that I will be traveling with my partner later this month (4 day thing in another state) and next month (2 week thing in a foreign country) and I really would like to have my first vacations without oxy pills just enjoying the time with my partner and feeling truly free, but I'm worried I'll be in the throes of PAWS with no energy, and she's been disappointed by me in the past on other vacations when I was using (she of course knows nothing of my habit), so I want to finally be a good travel partner for her, but also for myself. I'm an athletically inclined individual and eat healthy and such, just find it difficult to eat in the morning until I dose...and then struggle to eat throughout the day, which makes me think about dosing, but knowing I need to eat. ANy suggestions about the aforementioned? I feel like I'm RIGHT on the cliff of finally kicking this, I have it surrounded, but doing it alone has many trappings.",1489313803.0

And I haven't taken any since 2 and now my heart rate is fast and kinda weird but it went away and I'm fine. The fuck is going on guys. I got a125 blues. I don't no if it's pressed oxy into it and it's just a lot of oxy or just fent. But it has felt like an opiate every time I take it. Super strong when u snort a half and it dissolves very fast in my mouth. So if it is fent I guess it's dosed properly. Iono I had water and I feel better. Some zans too. And now I feel fine. Don't think I'm in wd my pupils r kinda small maybe normal and I'm not in shoulder pain and I've dislocated them a lot and am in pain a lot. So the fuck is going on is it cut with like some stim and opiates. And I just drank a lot of water and I fee better now. But still is fent speedy. Like I can't nod at all unless I'm been still for a while. So it feels like oxy and I've posted a pills before in my post history u can go look. I'm not home now so I cant take a pic.

I moved to a new city to start fresh, I brought minimal necessities, have a room in an attic of a new place with my best friend who is almost 2 months clean, his mother who cooks and takes care of us best she can while we're all looking and applying for work WHILE our car broke down on the way back up here moving the last of their things up here.

I've been lurking HARD, craving HARD, attempted to cold cop in my new stomping grounds, gave up and bought candy and ice cream and cigarettes.

I've been popping a methadone (10mg) maybe every other day or two days

I even ended up IVing these shitty white things (which is retarded, I know, but it gets me off even though I don't get the fucked up or a nod) with as much precaution [PUHLEASE don't pound onto me how the ROA has little to maybe no bioavailability, because I know, but I acquired a needle fixation] as possible.

I've been feeling super desperate, especially because we're low on actual food, even though we manage to have some dank dinners (THANK YOU MRS. BROWN) and my birth certificate is in my hometown so I can't apply for food stamps at least until I start to work ... and my hometown is a huge trigger for me, I know if I get there, even without cash, I could get at least a single bag of some lovely ecp. Yet, I have to go back there for the rest of my clothes, maybe a dresser, a very small table.

I miss my fucking cat. I cried before leaving knowing I was leaving her with my creepy Dad who will at least keep her alive but won't LOVE HER. By the way, this cat is at least 8 or 9 years old and I've never named her hahah. I figured once we both died and became part of the singularity, I would know her true identity (I love drugs, if you couldn't tell by my subtle nuances of personality).

I am happy, just not physically & chemically inclined to give a flying fuck about much. You all are as well fighting your own battles and even though I've just begun my touring of this awesome community on this lovely application (I'm on mobile so please excuse my mistakes) I still fear that I'll become another statistic in the sense I start here in r/opiates and will eventually end up clean and never come back.

I don't want that. I'm stuck in nostalgia in many aspects of my being & I've been hyper-aware of this for a long time. Is that fucked up?

I let my mom know I've been off heroin, today. I spoke to her last to wish her Happy Birthday on Jan 1st, her birthday. My birthday was on the 5th, that just passed.

Thanks for the happy belated, Momma.

She said she'd send me cash on Tuesday so I can get some nutella, bananas, bread, milk, cigarettes.

That's if I'm not on the move by then, find a dboy by foot, or send for one by paying extra, somehow..

All of you, I wish you all the best, Aho Mitakuye Oyasin!

I post here occasionally on my other account and love this community! 

I'm in the early stages of a project that will eventually become a self published book documenting my time as a addict, told through photos of my daily life, stories of my experiences with the people I met (obviously taking all steps necessary to protect identities), came to love, the intense connections that develop between us quickly through circumstance. I want to try and start a dialog about how addiction isn't just a black and white experience, show that we're all different. I want to tell a story that isn't the usual junkie/rock bottom/came to Jesus, will abstain my whole life thing. 

I've felt really unrepresented in all the stuff I've read about addiction. As a functional daily user who never fucked up a job or hurt people to get my fix, and who doesn't really like the AA one size fix all model, I really would like to find more people like me to anonymously interview for this project. 

So if you're comfortable with my possibly using your experience in a book totally anonymously, and would be comfortable telling me your story, please DM me! 

I have a set of questions I can send to you, and you can answer whichever you want, just skip it if it's not something you want to talk about.

To be honest, I was worst before I was on drugs--i was a fucking moody, neurotic mess. Now I am just this functional dysfunctional mess that surprises people that I do half the shit that I do--because I seemingly have it all together. That's a lot of pressure..and I don't even know how I started setting that precedent. Maybe it's from having a marriage full of abuse and violence and having to work and support him, our drug habits--and still be on top of the game--living in a nice place and working in a white collar position. I had to keep it together. Nothing makes me do that now--yet, I do it so well that people always think I am okay. Not being emo either. I am really okay-just sometimes I have to allow myself the right to say that I do wish I could share a little time with someone else..my own company gets stale..and I can only be in my own  head for so long....

Cold turkey methadone at 200mg-300mg for 3 years 6 months ago.,"I have been a user and abuser of opiates for the past 8 to 10 years, steady. As of about six months ago, I quit cold turkey a 100mg a day methadone habit. I went through a methadone maintenance clinic for three years, got to 100mgs and stopped increasing my dose. It was more like a 200 to 300 mg a day habit. Let me explain.

I would go three times a week and get take homes.
Monday : dose at the clinic, get a 100mg take home that I was supposed to take Tuesday but I would take it as soon as I left the parking lot. Go Wednesday: dose at the clinic for 100mg . Get a take home which I took as soon as I left the parking lot. Now, on Fridays I would dose at 100mg in the clinic, get two take homes of 100mgs each that were to be taken on Saturday and Sunday. You guessed it. I'd take them both the second I left the parking lot.

Now, I'm 6 months into a completely clean, no relapse period. Yay me. I quit the methadone cold turkey and for the first month I didn't sleep or eat. There wasn't one second that went by where I didn't think I wasn't about to die. I truly believed I was going to die and I came to grips that maybe death wouldn't be that bad and it couldn't be worse than these withdrawals. 

Long story short, 6 months later I'm healthy. I sleep, eat, have energy, all that good stuff. 

When I hear of a social gathering that I know I will be attending , I always think I have to find something to take or else it won't be as good a time. I don't drink alcohol so forget about that. I have plenty of good reasons why.

 Without opiates I feel like, even now, from the time I wake up until the time I go to sleep that my day wasn't that good of a day. Because I compare it to how great it could have been.

I've used opiates in the past, but never was much of a weed person. I just saw this segment on TV where they had all these elderly people in pain using marijuana (or some other method of administering THC) and they were talking about how much it helped with their pain. 

How much truth is there to this? Compared to opiates, how good is weed for pain? Is it really effective, or is it one of those ""I still feel it, but care about it a little less"" kind of things?

I'm open to believing it's effective but part of me is slightly skeptical. At the end of the day I really have no idea. I'm asking here because obviously on a weed board everyone will say how great it is either way. I trust your opinion here. ",1489278367.0

So I, like many of us, want and am trying to get clean. Get outta this life, start something new, etc. We all know it's hard. 

Other than the obvious hardships of getting clean (withdrawal symptoms, cravings), one of the worst for me is the HUGE amount of free time I have when trying, especially during the first week when cravings and withdrawal is the worst. I find myself literally counting minutes in boredom and anticipation for something. When you're in the game, there's always somewhere to be, someone to meet, money to make, and then just the overall fucking around when you have stuff. When I'm high, time flies and I don't care what I'm doing. Staring at a monitor for two hours is fine by me. But being sober, I'm painfully bored. Even if I'm not sick, I'm just twiddling my thumbs waiting for something. 

So. What do you guys do to pass the time? The worst is I have all this time but not motivation to do anything. I'll draw for a half hour, play games for an hour, whatever. But I'm still left with just hours and hours of downtime. Idle hands are the devil's workshop and all that.

I don't really know what I'm looking for. Get a hobby, work more, hang out with friends, etc.... I know the obvious answers. Guess I'm just bored haha and looking for discussion. I like can't even remember what I would do on weekends before dope.

I was contemplating how I spend my time each week and became curious how fucked it is compared to others. 


I bust my ass at work. I get paid proportionately but I net out 60-80 hours a week. Most weeks are 7AM-7PM. So I don't have much time left M-F. After I get home from work, I smoke pot, cook/eat dinner, shower, watch tv or read for an hour and then sleep. When Friday night rolls around, I'll do opiates right when I get off work and fall asleep around 3-5AM. I'll wake up Saturday around 10-11AM and start doing opiates again. I'll fall asleep around 12-3AM and wake up at 6AM on Sunday. On Sundays I usually try not to do opiates but I sometimes do. On days that I don't, I smoke a ton of pot and tell myself I'll take care of some chores/errands. I usually don't get much done besides taking out the trash and, once in a while, doing the laundry. I'll sleep around 8/9PM on Sunday because I go into work earlier on Mondays. And that restarts the cycle.

I started thinking about what I do with all my time because my inability to get basic shit done has really become apparent around my house and has quite honestly cost me a fuckton of money in late fees, past due bills, unclaimed checks, unreturned products, etc. I spend all my time during the weekdays working my ass off and at night I basically just eat and sleep. When the weekend comes, almost all that time goes to my opiate habit. 

Maybe one day I'll get my shit together lol. But for now, I'm killing it at work, making a ton of money, and consuming my favorite drug on the weekends. Whats your professionally degenerate lifestyle like?",1489255530.0

""Only problems clean opiates cause is addiction and withdrawal""

This is not true. It has been proven opiate use downregulates frontal hippocampus neurogenisis, suppresses immune system and lowers ability of natural cancer killer cells to fight tumours, can cause gallbladder and spinchter of oddi dysfunction, causes chronic inflammation of glial cells, and can suppress hormone levels. Not to mention the changes in endorphin and dopamine system.

There are multiple studies confirming all of the above statements, these are based on pure pharmaceutical opiates like morphine and derivatives. There is some evidence opioids like suboxone only partially share these traits. For example, subs tend not to suppress the immune system. There's even a study I've seen suggesting that cancer patients choosing to use more morphine have shorter life spans. Glial cell inflammation is caused by chronic opiate use and contributes to the rebound pain from using painkillers. There is some way to ameliorate this with low dose naltrexone but it's not an  exact science. If you take opiates chronically you should look into nootropics to help encourage health of the brain. These are all effects that contribute to the reason it's so tough to stay clean. It's not just your endorphin and dopamine system, and it's odd opiate users often claim to never get the Cold or flu because it's proven they are more prone to oppprtunistic infection, a byproduct of the drug first and foremost, living conditions and nutrition and other health markers are secondary to this.

Everyone should know all of the risks of drug use. I know it was my choice to start using but I feel dumb relying on the people on here and other forums constantly saying opiates are safe apart from dependency, and overdose  It's only right people should be fully informed about the effects of their drug use. I feel this information can help people understand why they feel the way they do when trying to quit and make better informed decisions regarding opiate use in relation to their pain or disease condition. 

Yes, pharmaceutical opiates are fairly safe, but there are long term and potentially lasting changes to various bodily structures and functions that everyone should be aware of. If you are using painkillers as part of a treatment plan for a specific condition you should know you are potentially lowering your chances of positive health outcomes due to your level of opiate use. I'm not sure what combination or dosage of certain other drugs or supplements like nootropics, low dose naltrexone,  immune system regulators like epicor and probiotics etc can do to downplay these mentioned issues but they are all options to help you retain your health while using opiayes to treat your pain issues or to help manage your recreational addiction. 

pain patients on opiates (fibromyalgia especially) should be very interested in lowering glial cell activation. Inflamed glial cells are basically the reason for rebound pain and the feeling that when you are clean things feel more painful. They basically become inflamed with chronic opiate exposure and this means your pain signals are amplified. The best available drug for this seems to be low dose naltrexone. There are multiple other drugs and supplements that can help as well, though. Fibromyalgia is generally understood to not be very well treated with opiates for this reason.

We are used to the idea that evil is always personified and conscious. Satan, Hitler, Darth Vader, etc. It is much easier for us to accept the consequences of some malicious intent than to agree with the fact that the pitchy dark horror is possible because of the normal human beings. And still we have to understand what had triggered the heroin nightmare which is exponentially spreading from Afghanistan around the world right now. Was it the result of some malicious wrongdoing or the good intentions put the whole country into hell? Let's try to figure it out.  

Here are some historical facts before we start. Afghanistan has been the opium producing country with its own specific market for a very long time. Conjointly Turkey and Afghanistan had been producing the opium for Iran, where around 1 million citizens had strong opium dependence, and which became the major doping consumer after the communist revolution in China. However, on the global scale, Afghanistan was far behind the producers of the Golden Triangle (in 1970 Burma solely put 500 tons of opium on the market). But the longstanding drought in the late 1970 significantly disrupted the opium production in the Southeast Asia and the Golden Triangle was replaced by the Golden Crescent (Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan). Iran left the club after the Islamic revolution when country's authorities declared the real jihad against the drug trade and local drug users that resulted in public crane dancing. Instead the leaders of the Afghan opposition, like Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, the leader of the Afghan Hezb-e Islami political party that was fighting against the Soviet forces, quickly turned not just into some drug lords but straight into the kings of the opium drug industry. The West preferred to turn a blind eye to everything because the 'freedom fighters' needed money to pay the weapons supplies. However, shuravi (that is how the mujahidin militants and Afghan people called the Soviet soldiers and military advisors) without false modesty have been reducing to dust the opium plantations along with their inhabitants, and helicopters have been raining down shells on the drug caravans. The dammed jinn had left his lamp, but the Soviet Union used to seize the jinn by the throat and whenever possible put him back into the lamp. The visibility of that control also existed during the Taliban rule. In the 90s these guys absorbedly had been stuffing themselves from the heroin pothole. But as the millennium passed they decided to start a great PR-campaign and present themselves as the drug menace fighters. The opium fields were set on fire, blood of the drug producers and couriers was spilled on the town squares and roads. And the price of the white death sachets moved up. Suddenly in 2001 the Operation Enduring Freedom hit the country. Later it became clear what kind of freedom it was. After the arrival of democracy the rugged bearded men continued to rape boys and put girls into rag cocoons. In this context nothing had changed. But since the US troops entered Afghanistan the area under opium poppy cultivation increased by 100 times and the final product output – heroin – by 40 times. If the first can be somehow explained by the pity for the Afghan peasants and stiff denial of the Soviet methods to fight the drug business, while the second part needs to be investigated. Actually the heroin production is a complex technological process that requires laboratories, precursors and trained staff. Before the 'democracy' came the whole production was concentrated in Pakistan, but with the arrival of American and European missionaries, the complete industrial scale opium production was established. The uncontrolled flow of specific fertilizers, drilling rigs, newest spraying systems that allow reaping the opium poppy harvest up to 4 times a year, generous credits from the Western banks, supplies of the special pharmacologic equipment, chemical agents, etc. hit the country... What was that? Poor judgment? Or a genius plan of some bigots? Once the Russian Bolshevik leader Lenin said: 'The capitalists will sell us the rope with which we will hang them.' Do the present wheeler-dealers, who provide the Afghan hash producers with all the details of the hellish technological circle, not understand that this may end with the syringe in the vein of their children and grandchildren? Or they just humbly obey the orders from the power players for whom we are just the expendables in the process of their great performance? It would be great to learn more about their plans.",1489394530.0

I can use anywhere from a gram to a gram and a half a day of black so i dont how a low tolerance. Any insight would be very helpful.,1489382939.0

So I found a bag of white powder. At first I thought blow. Upon closer inspection it didn't smell or taste like blow, so I crossed that off the list. The only other thing it looks like is baking soda. So I thought maybe that's all it is. Just out of curiosity I decided to have it tested for Fentanyl. It came up positive. So now i'm really wondering what it is. It taste's bitter and when you mix it with water it dissolves  and leave almost streaks in the water much like other substances when dissolved. Yes I sampled a small amount but didn't feel anything but a small possible histamine reaction. Yes i'm dumb. I'm to nervous to sample more but I am still extremely curios. I know it would be impossible to identify anything this way, but if you have any idea what you think it could be please i'd love to hear your opinion's. Also if I missed something I could look for in identifying it let me know. Thanks in advance!

I agreed and said fuck it, because I was in absolute hell and just wanted to go get my script and feel better. And this was only two days after trying to stop, I heard the withdrawals don't even peak until day 5-7..

I used the search function and only found one useful thread about this. What supplements do you guys use for withdrawal? Is kratom helpful? Kava? Weed?

I cannot stand the intensity of buprenorphine withdrawal, it's worse than heroin EVER was. With heroin, it was just hard to sleep and get out of bed, and I felt uncomfortable for 2 days and had diarrhea. With bupe its like that magnified 10x and apparently lasts way way longer.

Let me just start out with saying that I have a small oxy habit. I'll do half of a blue 2-3 times a week, so 15mg & that's it. Never consecutive days either. I've been on this trend for about 9 months now & all has been ok up until now.

It's been 2 days since I last dosed & I noticed I'm feeling pretty depressed overall. Let me also say that a reason I started with oxy is because of depression. My dad was killed this passed summer (not because of drugs or anything of that sort) & that obviously has had a very harsh effect on my overall well-being as well. I could never let my oxy habit take over my life because I am especially trying to help my mom cope with this too & I'm also home schooling myself to get a job in the field I actually find interest in as I'm currently not working either. Just been a rough fucking time. Used oxy as a way to just forget everything for a few hours when things got really intense.

I've never gone through a full blown withdrawal so I don't really know what I'm feeling. Maybe a combination of WD & my dad passing? I don't have any physical WD symptoms - no nausea or vomiting, I'm eating & sleeping fine, I don't feel flu-like at all, & I don't even have cravings too much really. Just straight down in the dumps.

I'm not saying I felt 100% fine after using ( mentally and physically ) But it was way different than what I had to go thru before..

I realize now (but of course I wanna deny it ) that I really haven't had any true time off to heal and fully recover zero dope in my system..  I don't keep track of my uses but I was using about 7-8times  a month/ twice a week ?? 
I would have 3-5 days of not using in between ... 
I guess you really need a month free of opiates to recover so if you do decide to chip it's a non issue.. Otherwise you will go right back to where u were after even using just once or twice ???

I hear successful stories about people chipping with no problem .. 
Mmmmmm 
was I even chipping ? Am I in denial ? Or is it all in my head and thinking that I'm sick because I wanna go use H and smoke C ???? Is my brain pulling a trick on me?? Am I just being a baby ? Can I still chip ?
I still wanna believe that I can chip.  

I'll be honest .. things have been getting harder tho .. Family found out I used, not eating n sleeping when using etc..

I live in the Northeast so we get ECP which is typically #4. My question is, how would you know if you have #3 vs. the typical #4 we get?  #4 is water soluble and #3 is not so it requires citric acid... I know this. But how would you be able to tell whether it is #3 or #4 once you put it in the water and mix it up?  It seems like #4 doesn't necessarily mix well into the water, like you know how when you spray the water on your dope in the spoon, the dope just stays together in a clump and doesn't naturally mix with the water...  How would you know if you have #3 and you therefore need citric acid to help break down your dope in the water?

I'm assuming the Heroin trade routes keep the same kind of dope going to the same parts of the world, however, I highly doubt that these heroin suppliers give a shit to make sure that like the USA gets #4 all the time and the #3 only goes to the UK and Europe...  You know what I mean?... Like how the hell does it work out that all the #4 only goes to the USA and that no #3 ever gets sent to the USA.

I'm going to pose a few questions about my dope for ya'll, but first a little info on it. I've recently procured 2 new dboys recently in addition to my normal go to guy. All have different product. Let's call my normal dude X. X's dope is your standard black tar (west coast btw). It's sticky/gooey with a vinegar smell and a niiiiice rush but, it doesn't have a very powerful or long high. I also know for a fact it comes from cartel. Dboy Y has a harder rock candy type dope. Y's dope doesn't have as good a rush as Xs, but the high is a little better and leggier. Y's dope also makes me very sleepy. Now there's Z. Z claims his dope is the best he's ever tried and is 10/10 but let's be real. Z's dope had an okay rush. Better rush than Y but not as good as X and a really good high. What wierds me out and, leads into my main question is, I fell asleep for an hour about 10 min after my shot and again for 15 min after my second shot. Like sleepy as fuck, don't remember passing out, Xanax blackout type pass out. I was doing a little bit larger shots than normal with Z's dope. I can't decide which dope to pick up. My main question is, why am I getting so sleepy and passing/blacking out after a shot when the rush wasn't really that good? Are the rush and the high mutually exclusive? Am I overdosing and just don't realize it? Or is the dope cut with dyphenhydramine or the like?

TL;DR Some dope is making me super sleepy and pass out unrelated to the strength of the rush. Am I ODing or is it something else.",1489503466.0

Basically my veins have been shit for a while, I occasionally hit the one on top of my foot or the odd one in my hand, but it’s like once out of ten.
So lately I’ve indulged in coke and we all know what that means for us needle freaks: you’ll be poking yourself every ten minutes at best. Hence, I had to act. I’d heard about the neck before but I was too scared of hitting an artery or a nerve instead. Eventually, the fiending took over and I stood in front of my mirror and did the whole blow air out while keeping your mouth shut. Boom, what a nice vein the external jugular is. All the way from my ear to my collarbone I see this beautiful, bouncy, sponge-like garden-hose. It’s a joy to just push down on it (I’ve developed a vein fetish). Anyway, get my insulin needle (29g) and go in shallow at the base, an inch above the collarbone. Remember I have held my air in all this time. So after I pull pack a bit to create a vacuum, a bunch of dark blood flows in. Carefully I push off, I only got like 20 units but they’re PACKED with coke. Like a 2:1 speedball.

So after pushing off, I get lightheaded. Must be the oxygen deprivation, I think to myself and then BAM! The coke just kicks me in the fucking nose. Never has White gotten me this high. Debating on hitting my neck again, this shit is a whole new level.

Let's dig a bit deeper though:

- I have a natural tolerance so i have to smoke loads to get anywhere 'nice' with H, over the course of several hours. 
- I don't really get nauseous for the first 4 or 5 hours, but much later after the first dose, for example yesterday 7 hours later.
- 7 hours after the first dose when you dose at 2200 is 5 am. Odds are, i'll find myself asleep then. 
- The nausea i get is different from what one gets when they eat too much or eat something bad - it's more a case of instant puke rather than a long winded vomiting process. 

Long story short i'm concerned that i could go to bed feeling completely fine and not nauseous at all, but then insta-vomit in my sleep and choke. 

Am I worrying needlessly? If not, what are my options? I can think of :

- dose early on in the day so that by the time i go to sleep i'll either have come down, puked, or both
- force myself to puke before i go to sleep (which is what i did last night).

It's 1:30am and I cant sleep. Figured I'd pop into my favorite sub and tell a story of caution. 

Long story short, I went to the emergency room during work because I felt something was wrong with my insides. Turns out it was appendicitis.

They admitted me almost immediately, and asked the basic questions. I told them no history of drug use, hoping they wouldn't treat me like a junkie. They believed me (I only smoke) and gave me morphine.

It felt great, especially since before I came to the emergency room, I dashed home to smoke some BTH in my room, in true junkie fashion.

Everything was going well, and then the surgery happened. They had to put me under anesthesia. I remember my lungs literally freezing. No breathes in, no breaths out. Beeping, Yelling, then darkness.

Turns out the BTH I smoked (I had been smoking all day really) before coming in, mixed with the morphine, plus the anesthesia, literally killed me. I was out for a couple minutes while the revived me. 

Now here I am, day 3 in recovery, not being able to fart with a sore stomach, trapped in the hospital because apparently I have an infection. What really sucks though is I can't WAIT to gtfo of here so I can smoke the rest of by BTH... oh well.

Depression.
Where to start. I don't feel... anything. The last time I felt something was when a very close relative died and I was devasted. That word doesn't even desribe how i felt. For weeks and months after no change. 

I sleep in my gross ass clothes and might shower what, twice a week ? i know its gross i just don't do it. I do however keep my room clean and do chores and still have the motivation to go to interviews so i have that going.

My anxiety at the minute is horrible, i leave the house i think people are following me, staring at me, talking about me. I can't strike up the courage to talk to people outside my junkie friends because i think im being judged for it? I know i'm not but it feels to real.

I seem to have got myself stuck in cycle of money, score, feel happy, feel sad, go to sleep, repeat. I dont see an end in sight and my one actual best friend from back home i'm lying to and god i can't even think about what I make my folks go through.

Always typical dealer bullshit to 10 min means 2 hours sometimes.  Anyways his girl has his phone and tell she's me to roll by the crib instead of her driving . I've known her for awhile and she's always been really cool with me. She's dope, she's super ripped and lifts weights and shy while her bf is a lazy fat POS I don't know why she stays with him . ive known her since high school and she has been with dude Straight since like grade 9. It's funny because she used to be an honor roll student and he was always a piece of shit lol.

Anyways she asks if I wanna grab food for her cuz her license is suspended and I take her to the restaraunt. While we are waitin for the Greek salad and gyros in the corner of the lot she tells me she's sick of her bfs bullshit and how frustrating t is to live with him because he's always shaming her for eating clean and going to the gym all the time. She straight up starts crying and tells me she can't deal with it anymore and I'm comforting and giving her like a friendly hand on the the shoulder and I'm thinking Damn these gyros are taking awhile and she starts suddenly kissing my hand and then bam she's on top of me with her yoga pants rolled down and riding me raw no rubber. It was hot as hell tbh she looks like she should be on the cover of a fitness magazine. shes super pretty too just your typical farm girl nedt door who got with a piece of shit. When I was coming close to cumming I told her I was about to nut and She whispers in my ear in the most insane sexy girl voice ever , ""finish inside me daddy"" and I'm like ugh oh god no no no YUYYUYeeeees. It was fuckin amazing. I haven't been laid in months so it was simply amazing. 
We did a bunch of dope after and ate Greek food and then went to the gym.
 She's moving out and into my place before homie gets out of jail lol

I'm not sure what to make of this situation . I'm sort of scared for my life's beside even though dude isn't real the people he works for are. Anyways I've crushed on her for years so I'm really happy. We both use a little
But, on and off and we both are religious gym nuts. She does personal training and supports herself so I don't feel taken advantage of and she's paying half the rent already. 

Oh well I'm

Now I plan on crushing it to make it IR and maybe plugging it or taking it orally (I know oral BA sucks it's at around 30% and rectal BA is around 45-60%).

Tried to put into words the best I could, just want somebody to relate to.","Fucked, good and properly fucked. I went in dry on myself as I tend to do right as the smoke from my previous fires starts to clear. Is this self-destruct mechanism that seems hard wired in me genetic? Is it the lack of fucks I give that ends up taking me towards a life of misery, a life where a single mattress on the floor illuminated by a bare bulb seems like a luxury? The real mystery is I will try so hard sometimes, and start caring about the path that I'm choosing to take. It could be climbing up the steepest of mountains and right before I hit the summit completing my goal I would see a cliff with a sheer drop and without thinking twice take a leap of faith. It only strikes me when I'm half way down and see the rocks rapidly approaching that I realize I've done it again. I have taken so many detours in this life. Convincing myself it's just the scenic route around. When in reality I'm just going in circles. Finding new ways to reach the same destination, the bottom of the mountain.

I can't blame a lack of fore-site or an inability to understand consequences. I can't blame the life I was forced into or the tragedy I didn't ask for. Not where I grew up, a bad teacher, or my parents. Really I can't even blame the drugs, they were just throwing gasoline on an already burning flame. Knowing I only have myself to blame is the true unsolvable equation. A problem that has a formula but no answer. The last few pages torn out of a who done it book. Maybe my sub-conscious knows why but I feel like it speaks one of those languages that had no alphabet and died out hundreds of years ago because when I really ask myself why. Why? I get nothing of substance in return. Sometimes I get a mumble, a whisper that I can't even convince myself is legit. The same 3 song playlist. Sad, Content, Destruct. On repeat for as long as I can remember. I know all the words to these songs but the eject button is broken. I can turn the volume down but that doesn't stop them from playing. A lot of people who write construct a scenario to make you ask yourself a certain question and then suggest an answer. Revealing the secrets to the universe like a pair of tits at Mardi Gras. Well I don't have a pair of perky young tits or a set of beads to see anybody elses. What I have is a hunger for questions about myself that don't seem to have any answers. 

If hunger didn't exist than neither would starvation. I'm looking at the menu but the kitchen is closed. I wish what I thought I knew tasted better, but my sell by date has come and gone. Like so many nights convincing myself of this or that when what I really know is equal to filling a journal without a pen, or trying to split the atom with a pair of scissors. Like your destination will be on the right after two left turns and a U-turn in the middle of the fucking ocean. Without an answer to suggest, some meaningful revelation to give there is no real direction or destination. Just a huge circle to exactly where you were one step ago. All I can hope for is somebody who enjoyed the scenery along the way. If my mind were a building it would lack structural integrity, no emergency exit, and the restaurant on the top floor would fail it's health inspection. Somebody please come fly a fucking plane into me before I'm forced to stage a controlled demolition. Maybe there isn't supposed to be an answer to why, maybe leaving it blank, nothing, is the answer. If there really is no concrete answer, it just is, then I just used a whole lot of words to say I know nothing. I am nothing, all around me... Nothing.",1489443573.0

Typically 2 in the morning, and 3 or 4 in the afternoon. I've followed this regimen for years without issue until the last couple months. 

In the past few months, I've noticed my kidneys reacting painfully, mainly when lying down, about an hour after ingestion. The higher the dose, the worse the problem becomes. I've never had blood in the urine, but the flank pain is distracting and very noticeable. Also, urine output typically decreases with the larger doses. Additionally, it seems like my right abdomen tends to swell with additional fluid, swelling and restricting movement. These symptoms almost totally go away at smaller doses around one 80mg or so. The greater the dose, the greater the side effects. 

Mind you, this is solely related to the OP 80s, as no other drugs enter my system. I'm wondering if anyone else has had a similar reaction? I'm just concerned that maybe my body has had enough after all these years. ",1489435078.0

I used to be pretty active in this sub and r/stims before I got clean. 

I've been dealing with depression for a very long time, been suicidal for a long time, too. Lately I've gone from thinking about it to seriously planning it. I wasn't just in a bad mood, and it wasn't to get attention or whatever. 

I still have things I need to do before I do it, and I'm hoping things get better before that time comes. 

It was really bad last night, and I was close to putting a gun to my head impulsively. But like I said, I don't want to kill myself before getting affairs in order and all. So I just ended up getting some dope instead and it kinda helped.

But yeah I got a lot of messages from strangers begging me not to go through with it. I know people love me and will be heartbroken and that's kept me from pulling the trigger a few times. So I'd like to thank everyone who replied, I wasn't expecting anyone to actually care.

So I'm trying, I really want things to get better for me. It's really hard to continue on and it's a struggle everyday to stay here. But I don't wanna do it without trying everything else first. So we'll see what happens I guess. But for now I'm not feeling as bad as I normally do thanks to dope. It's supposed to snow tomorrow so I'm gonna pick up a good amount and hopefully it'll help.

I've been playing RPGs since I was young and every once in awhile I compare my sickness to ""health"".

When I start getting sick I'm at like 99% but slowly it drops until I'm puking at 10%

When I boost stuff to sell I look at it like ""I have to complete this quest to unlock 'items'"" and when I'm traveling I see it as ""you cannot fast travel when enemies are nearby""

I know it's corny but its just alittle thing I do in my head. Like getting the key in a dungeon in LoZ. I get the ""key"" (money) to ""unlock the door"" (cop)


So does anyone else have a different way of looking at picking up that isn't just ""get money, get drugs, get home""? Or am I just a geek who's also a heroin addict? lol

I really feel like I can't be the only nerd who became an addict and carried over some stuff into my addiction.

Even before drugs if I was walking home I'd think of it as losing stamina and having to ""rest"" to restore it.",1489425047.0

I was withdrawling from nodding on a fentanyl analogue for a month straight, it was quite horrible. Of course, there wasn't much sleep but on the third day or so, I took some Xanax and fell asleep. A few hours later, 3am, I woke up in a sweat. I felt weird. I then tried to fall back asleep but I kept thinking my bed was made out of water and I was trapped inside and couldn't breathe. All my thoughts included drowning or water in general. This kept going for half an hour, I was totally freaking out, I couldn't think straight. Then it stopped and I could fall asleep again after taking more Xanax. I also watched a ton of Simpsons during my nodding and when withdrawling I constantly had thought loops of the series, imagine a scene looping 20 times in your head every time you close your eyes, no way to stop it, it made me go crazy.

I've used opioids on n of for 6+ years and have tried pretty much every pharma opioid available in the US (even snorted dope a few times a while back) but methadone is the only one I've yet to try.... Came across a few 5mg tablets and was wondering if it's safe to take when my tolerance at the moment is fairly low at 15-20mg oxy orally to get right. I've done tons of research on the drug so I know the Buzz and overall effects will be completely different. I also take Clonazepam as prescribed daily... Usually just 1x .5mg, some times two. Which is really the main reason I'm posting this is cause I haven't seen any reports/experience of low doses of both being mixed... All the info I can find is people on MMT or just people with massive tolerances taking 30,50,75,120+mg Mdone with several mg of xan or kpins.

I just want to be as safe as possible is all. Any advice/help would be greatly appreciated. No need to lecture me either, I have lots of experience with opiates in general just not methadone... Had a pretty large oxy/dilly habit a while back so I know about the addiction/WD side of things also. Just looking for advice and personal opinions to remain as safe as possible like I said.

Hustling and doing random day labor to get high as fuck everyday and living in a tent. Junking to the fullest. 

The other day I was outside of the gas station charging my phone and this random dude comes up and starts talking to me about how he just got out of detox for heroin. I have a bag of rigs and a gram in my book bag and I'm high as fuck. He buys me a pack of cigs and some food and we chill. I eventually tell him I'm physically dependent on h etc. he tries to get me to go to detox but is cool and not pushy. 

Due to needing to get my shit together so I don't stay a homeless junky forever and needing to get a place for me and my gf when she gets out of prison I decide to cold turkey dope again. Ugh. 

Day 1 cold ass weather hits and a lady I know says I can sleep on her couch a week. Ballin. I decide the universe is trying to help me kick by offering this to help. She doesn't know I junk and it's hard to leave and come up with excuses or be in the bathroom for however god awful long it takes me to hit a vein so it'd be hard (not impossible, never impossible) to score and get high here. 

Day 2 I have a job interview. I don't want to go. I don't want to do anything. But I go and get the job. They ask when I can start I say next Monday. Need time to get through this. 
I feel like complete shit. Dude from gas station randomly texts to ask how I am and I tell him. He says he has something for me and a lot of other really positive shit. 

I Meet him at the gas station. Lady I'm staying with thinks I'm going out for drugs. I say a friend offered to buy me cigs and she believes it bc she knows I smoke and am out but still finds it weird. Wtf ever I need any relief I can get. Met with him and he gives me a bag of stuff and a pack of cigs. 

The bag has 20 gabapentin , like 25 grams of Kratom and 2 8mg suboxone !!! It helped so fucking much. I actually slept last night! I'm tapering with the subs and it's been 3 days since I shot dope. Trying to quit being such a major fuck up. He would've hooked me up with xanax and weed also but I'm on probation and can't risk it. Thank god for this random dudes hook up I feel infinitely better. No judgement to those still junking. I would be if I could and also live indoors lol but my gf is counting on me to have a place for when she gets out and my last shot took 2 fucking hours to hit a vein so I'm taking a break for the first time in forever.

you were my indemnity for many indiscretions---

In Bryant Square,  right before Autumn,
right before my fall, your fall, our fall

sat with an old man who showed us Origami made with yellowed newspaper.
He had so many little shapes, all made with that yellowed paper, he said
he only liked the old paper,

looked at me, then---
with a light in your eye
that said:
“this will continue again one day”.

Who is going to fold us?
Where will that man be?
I don’t know Origami.
Do you?
I bet he’s dead now. 
I want my legs around your shoulders again,

I want a hand that doesn’t go away
and a kiss that never ends
and a promise that isn’t broken,
a back, steadfast and secure

5zoe1z,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/5zoe1z/pharmacist_advice/,204,https://redd.it/5zoe1z,Pharmacent,Pharmacist Advice,"Hey all, I am a pharmacist and wanted to give you guys a quick AMA/guide on prescriptions.  How many times have you gotten a prescription, only to be unable to get it filled?  This guide should help with this.  I do not condone drug abuse/misuse, follow your prescriber's instructions at all times.

1.  Get a real prescription.  If you're new to an area, ask your pharmacist for recommendation of a doctor.  We know who is a liberal prescriber vs conservative.  We can spot fake prescriptions a mile away.  Same with alterations of the prescription.  There are plenty of pain management doctors in your area that will order drugs for you, don't risk a prison sentence for a refill or a few more tablets.
2.  Establish a relationship with a pharmacy/pharmacist.  When we say ""we don't have that in stock"" it can mean 2 things, either we don't have it in stock or we don't want to fill the prescription for you due to suspicions.  Sit down & tell the pharmacist your situation, and that this is going to be a monthly thing for you.  Tell them about your pain and how hard it is to get this prescription filled each month.  Promise to return regularly, ask about a flu shot if it is flu season.  Find a pharmacy close to home, usually grocery stores or mom & pop pharmacies will be more likely to fill your prescription.  Don't pharmacy hop just because X pharmacy has a coupon for transfers or Y gives store points.  Pick one and stick with it.
3.  Do not try to fill your prescription early, say you lost your medications, or violate your narcotics agreement.  If you bring us an order from a dentist or ER, we are required by law to alert your pain doctor who may cut you off.  Most states have programs that will show any controlled substances filled throughout the state so choosing another pharmacy won't help either.  Federal law allows us to fill your prescription on the 28th day following the previous one, unless the dose or directions change.  Check your prescription for ""do not fill until x.""  Add the date to your cel-phone so you know when your next fill is due & don't draw un-necessary attention to yourself with early fills.
4.  Try not to wait for your prescription, it only raises more red flags.  Drop it off & tell them you will pick it up tomorrow if possible.  This will also allow the pharmacy to order the drug if they truly don't have it in stock.  Give them a good phone # to contact you if there are any delays.
5.  Don't request specific brands, manufacturers, or color tablets.  While certain manufacturers may sell for more on the street or work better for certain things, this will only reduce your chances of getting the order filled.  Eventually, once you build a relationship with your pharmacist you can make this request.  Wait at least 6 months.
6.  Don't pay cash for your prescription.  Use insurance if you have it, if not get a pre-paid credit card.  See if you qualify for medicaid, and if you're a veteran you can probably go to your local VA.  Cash payments are a huge red flag, especially for expensive medications.
7.  Clean up for your monthly visit.  Take a shower, put on a clean shirt.  Wear clean shoes or at least clean your shoes (have seen guys in a tie with nasty looking shoes, RED FLAG).  If you cannot do any of the above, use the drive-through and tell them you will pick it up the next day.  Don't come in drunk, high, or otherwise impaired.  While prescription day is exciting, wait until after pick up to celebrate.  Keep in mind some prescribers will drug test during your visit, make sure whatever you are on shows in your urine and nothing else.
8.  Don't tell us your life story.  Don't make un-necessary conversation.  Tell us your personal information, insurance, and when you want to pick this up (NEXT DAY).  Talking too much will definitely raise some red flags, especially about un-related issues or to the pharmacist himself.  Give the technician your script and bounce.
9.  Fill everything at one pharmacy.  If your profile has nothing but narcotics it is another red flag for us.  Get some blood pressure medication and other things on your profile as well.  If your doctor writes you 5 prescriptions, get all 5 filled.  Don't say ""just fill the opiate"" and toss the rest (RED FLAG).  If you have trouble affording your medications, ask your pharmacist for recommendations.  We can probably contact your doctor to get something changed and save you some money.
10.  Don't talk on your cell phone at the counter or bring other people with you to the pharmacy.  Go by yourself if possible, use the drive through if possible, drop the prescription off, and pick the medication up later or the NEXT DAY!  Don't buy other things in the pharmacy.  Pick up only your prescription and leave.  If you need to do other shopping, pay in a different section of the store.  Again, your goal is to LAY LOW and not be noticed or remembered by staff.
11.  If you need needles, most pharmacies sell them without a prescription (varies by state).  Go to a different pharmacy than your usual fill, tell them you are traveling & ran out of insulin syringes.  You inject 10 units of Lantus under the skin of your stomach at bedtime.  They should sell you a box for cash, buy the whole box of 100 unless they offer you a pack of 10.  Use clean needles and do not share them.  Prevent the spread of diseases.
12.  DEA rules say that controlled substances may only be released to household members or caregivers.  Some pharmacies go as far as making sure the address on your driver's license is the same as the patient's.  If they ever ask your relationship to the patient, it should be ""caregiver.""
13.  Don't try to use immodium or other drugs to stave off withdrawals.  Find a recovery doctor and get some suboxone.  These offices are expanding and are becoming easier to get in to for treatment.  If you are a veteran, you may be able to get free care at your local VA.

I hope these tips help someone navigate their pharmacy successfully.  I will try to answer questions for the next hour or so.  Stay safe out there, pharmacists truly care about the well-being of our patients and will bend over backwards to help you in any way we can.",1489636246.0

There was blood under his pillow in the hospital. These images terrify me and I'd like to know that although his body reacted violently, that at least his mind felt something else. 

EDIT: I initially wrote in this post that the sub disturbed me. A commenter showed me that if I dig deeper I'll find much more such as people seeking help and such. I came for a quick answer and upon reading the front page to see if I was at the right place-I only saw things that scared me. So apologies for not taking more time to read.

However, on that note-fight the stigma. It's slowly going away. People are here to hear you out and help if you are seeking it. Also, if you are a veteran struggling with drug addiction, feel free to talk to me. My brother was a veteran with a chronic injury, PTSD, and anxiety. I want to help whoever I can if his story can help others.

Anyways...TL;DR is dying on opioids painful or blissful?",1489621175.0

My life has been shit for a long time now. Parents divorce. laid off. student loans defaulted. brother just died. mother in financial troubles worse than me. etc.

anyway. I've been diagnosed with depression multiple times in my life and have failed at suicide twice now. statistically, if I try to kill myself again I'll probably succeed.

my question to you all is simple: can heroin be something worth living for? Im well aware of the downside that comes with using but there has got to be some sort of upside otherwise logically nobody would put up with the bad.

if your life right now is already worse than the worse downsides that come with an H habit could starting to use possibly give me a reason to live?

at this point I believe using might at least give me a few moments of respite. and if it sucks eventually I'll kill myself like I'm considering right now anyway",1489619231.0

It's almost as if the doctors are ignorant to the fact that an opiate is an opiate is an opiate. They know subs and methadone can be abused, that they can be diverted; and yet they're comfortable throwing them around but a cancer patient has a hard time getting some fucking hydrocodone. I really do wonder if the heydays of getting high doses of subs and methadone are going to come to an end, because it just doesn't make sense that people have access to those but not, say, oxy or hydro.


Again, I think it will perhaps be even easier in the near future to get on maintenance but the way they attempt to prevent people from becoming ""addicted"" you would think they'd start tightening controls.

So armed with my bottles I headed to the ladies room in the shopping centre in search of piss to harvest. But alas no Bueno, these toilets had water clear as crystal. Serves me right for going to a nice area. But as a socialist I've gotta say I admire the job those cleaning ladies did. So on to my next spot, a department store with less toilets but fuck me I hit the fucking lottery. There was a loo full of unflushed piss and I harvested that golden wonder with no shame. There's no chance that lady would have dirtier pee than me right? So I took those bottles to the drugs service, warmed them up with hand warmers, gave them in and passed!

Or especially paid an extra tax to the dboy when picking up even tho they agreed to a lower price beforehand - ya, all those people commenting are absolutely so badass and invincible that they would NEVER give in to the dboy's demands; in fact, that they'd rather fight dude than to let him rip them off.... ya right!!!!! If that guy was your only connect, or the sole oasis in a desert of a disappearing market, we know that you're all so fucking strong and relentlessly awesome that you just shoot a motherfucker rather than to throw down an extra $10 or whatever 

And just FYI to all these east coast folks who get their shit in bags and bundles and from random hood corner boys - THATS NOT THE ""NORM!!!"" Sure, it's super easy to replicate and portray as a heroin deal specifically on TV. But guess what y'all.... get 100 miles west/inland/south, and nobody is doing dumbass stamp bags. Much of the powdered/salt-form dope in the US is sold in one individual bag that is made specifically to order after the customer requests it. Some dboys will only do a half g or a g or a ball and no other increments, but it is incredibly common to have someone be picking up a 0.7g bag that weighs just at 0.7g, for a fixed price based on the 7 tenths of a gram because each tenth is the same price no matter the amount purchased- in many rural areas it is super common for people to charge upward of $40/tenth aka $400/g. And these shitbrained comments of ""oh my god you're such a dumbass just go to the next dboy and let the dude trying to rip you off that you'll spend your money on a better deal without a second thought"" .... JESUS CHRIST PEOPLE, there's no such thing as the next dboy!!!! Sometimes it's not even a real one, just one junkie in the little town who drives 6hrs round trip to a major city center to pick up a half oz at a time and selling at outrageous prices simply to fund his own habit

When I first started lurking here around the end of 2014 when I first downloaded a Reddit app on my phone, 98% of comments were all super supportive and encouraging while 1% were just people really fucked up unable to type coherently and the last 1% being a random hater from outside the sub trying to tell us that we are shitty people who all need to die anyway

So now that that last 1% of the random haters has dropped dramatically over the years, why is it that *fellow users* are so hateful/pompous/closed-minded/narcissistic/total bullshit????? We all know how stigmatized we would be if all of our secrets were exposed in a way we didn't approve of or wanted exposed.... so for real, it's the internet- no one is impressed by theoretical toughguy acts in the comments section 

I think we could definitely refer to these types of unproductive and self righteous responses as what they really sound like - ""trumping"" ",1489765302.0

For about 6 months I've been able to get my hand on Oxy and I was taking anywhere from 15-30mg every single day. 45mg if I was feeling saucy. 

My source ran dry and I'm on a sudden, forced detox. Last night was the worst. I got almost no sleep and I was freezing then hot. Then freezing. Then hot. I've been shitting my brains out, I feel 'shaky' (don't know how else to describe it) and generally miserable. 

I've considered finding a local H source but I'm too much of a pussy to go out and meet up. I'm scared of being arrested.  I've been looking at DMN for stuff and I think I would be able to pull it off but I'm not tech wizard and god knows I'd probably fuck that up, too. 

I guess I'm just venting. It's not just a physical addiction I'm desperate for that relief I was able to look forward to at the end of every day. It got me through most days and now I feel like I have absolutely nothing to look forward to. Just more misery. 

How long will this withdrawal last? I think physically it will pass but mentally I'm going to be looking for something to get me 'there' again for a long time. I'm torn between saying 'fuck it, I don't care if this leads me down the path to ruin because I  need that feeling"" and saying ""you've read where this goes, it doesn't matter how good it feels now it'll fuck you in the end"".

This is probably one of those annoying dosage questions, and I apologise for that, but I just wanted to make sure i'm not going to do anything stupid.

I currently use short release oxycodone 10mg, 4 - 5 times a day, everyday when I can't get heroin (not much money lately but my partner doesn't use his oxys) i'm lucky enough that this still gives me an energetic buzz without making me nod out.  

When I can afford it I buy heroin from the dark web, and I smoke between 0.5-0.7g a day and this has me nodding hard. (I don't take oxy when I have heroin).

I have ran out of the short release oxycodone, and only have oxycontin 10mg OC's   -  If I crushed 10mg of the 12hr release OC and swallow it, would it have a similar effect to the 10mg of short release or would more than 10mg of the drug be released into my system at once?

Also, If I decided to start snorting again, is it safer to start at a quarter of the pill to be on the cautious side or is it the same as crushing and swallowing?   I used to snort like a crazy woman without any fear, but lately I seem to be nervous of it.

Sorry that this sounds like such a noob post, I've had this habit for a few years now, but still don't understand the details of pharmacology and time releases etc!

Heh. 

Just my luck, he calls me today and says that after getting some blood work they came back and said there is probable cause or whatever the fuck they call it that he has Hep C. He has to go in for further testing for it to be 100% confirmed or denied but apparently there is a chance he does.

So that brings me to my question, if he does come back positive for the Hep, does that mean I definitely got it from sharing that one time? I understand that there is a huge chance yes, but I guess I just don't know if it's guaranteed. I am going to go get myself tested either way, but if he comes back positive, what's the chance I got it from him from that one use?

5zuaoo,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/5zuaoo/side_effects/,8,https://redd.it/5zuaoo,Southern_psychonaut,Side effects,"So after like 2 fuckin yrs in the same spot I finally got a hook that let me grip some boy actually worthy of being called what it is... these last couple days I've very much enjoyed being able to nod out/sleep super soundly with only a 1/4pt or 1/2pt max line- and to chill I've just been doing small bumps (I sniff) while also hitting up a small bit of ice to make sure I don't sleep all damn day haha

So now... well, let's just say ice is kinda crazy. Usually I'm not terribly into it; only as a social thing occasionally (especially if one or more of the guys hanging out is sexy lol, always fun to get them to light the bowl for me because ""I'm really bad at it and don't wanna burn it up)... so now here I sit p fuckin high like a ridiculous person, watching some very cheesy porn from the late 90s. The production value is TERRIBLE and the ""straight boys"" who are experiencing their ""first time"" are sooooo incredibly not straight but very much pretending to be so simply with a baseball cap and boxers instead of styled hair and something like a thong that'd normally be what's going on

I say ice is weird because while the porn is on and <some> scenes are relatively hot.... well, I'm not hard, not jacking off, not really sure *why* I have on the porn

(Oh and it's cheesy late-90s bc I live in a Bible Belt state and for some reason despite being in a relatively large city for the south this is all that the local sex shop carries homo-wise)

TL:DR- I'm a raging homo and whether or not I'm actually horny, smoking crystal apparently really makes me feel like putting on some cheap-o porn #shitpost #sorrynotsorry",1489708657.0

Quick oxy story.,"The professor handed back the papers from last week’s class. Luckily for us snow and sleet fell earlier in the week making an alcoholics wet dream come true. The alarm clock on my phone rang with a terrifying association of getting up taking the bus to the center of campus, which is beautifully decorated with Georgian brick but buildings rigged with lights so fucking strong you suddenly see that asshole wearing sunglasses inside as less of a douchebag, and more of a genius. I had a fresh bottle of shitty flavored vodka in the freezer, so instead of descending back into the vivid dream I was having about dope, pills and hot stripper bitches, I reached down to grab the laptop sitting uncomfortably on a muddy pile of clothes which probably smelled like sweat and cheap lite beer, from the frat party the night before, but so did everything else in the house so I’m use to it. It was noon, and it was time to get to the party. There were too many messages on the Groupme page to read, but I knew Chris was already there and I didn’t want to miss the fun so I poured three quarters of the 40 proof into an empty Gatorade bottle, picked up an Arizona from the gas station and walked in the snow to Yotom’s apartment down the street. 
“Where you at man I’m outside” 
“Come up dude” 
I walked in to a room of nine college students whose eyes had the same glow as middle school kids on a snow day. I ripped 6 shots while Yotom called the uber. The party was great. Lots of sorority girls bundled up in bean boots and north faces and guys in roughed up Tims and basketball jerseys. Too many natty light cans to count and 2 kegs for when the cases ran dry. 

I had taken a one-day tolerance break, and that was all I could handle. I needed an oxy. I looked down into the pill bottle lamenting the times it was nearly full. Now only 2 pills remained. I popped them both and boy oh boy were they nice.

I woke up at midnight that night recalling the events from the party and getting home. I had gotten home, puked and passed out. Fuck. My knee hurt more than my head. Damnit I was so loaded I was running around like crack head. It had been 7 months since I did any sort of running. My meniscus was torn for the third time and I was out of oxys .I only got lousy 5mg pills for the month to hold me off. What a joke. I was taking 2 before class and 3 before bed. I was buzzin harder than Aldrin and the pain was almost not that bad. The good times couldn’t last forever. Now I sit in class reminiscing on the week before where I had my life back and a warm blanket of opiate warmth over me. I didn’t worry about walking. I didn’t constantly wince in pain. Now I have to wait 2 weeks until my next prescription, and I cant even find any fucking benzos to black out once in a while. But I’m patient. Something will come up eventually.
This community is great. I love you guys, and while I dabble lightly, I still dream of getting heroin. No literally I had a dream last night where I shot up and I woke up feeling like I was loved. I guess that’s what happens when you’re on the sub looking at dope porn all day! Anyways, I’m off to drown my sorrows and pain at a mixer tonight, another day closer to getting back under that warm blanket.

Anybody a fan of orange G74's?,"So, casual user here, and oxymorphone is my favorite opiate that I've tried so far- I find it gives me intense euphoria and joy, in addition to incredible relaxation, without the ""speediness"" of oxycodone (which is not always a good thing, especially if you're trying to fall asleep). 

I realize the recent reformulation of name brand Opana (to be more resistant to abuse) has resulted in a shortage of sorts, and many people have had trouble finding it anywhere...

I've had luck finding generic 40 mg ER tablets, which are bright orange and imprinted ""G74"" and supposedly marketed by Global Pharmaceuticals. The orange coating is easily removed and the resulting white powder is easily insufflated.

My question is this- how do these G74's compare to the instant-release Opana from ""the good ol' days?"" Is there any chance what I've been using is a high-quality fentanyl press? (I doubt it, as I've read fent does not give most people euphoria...and this stuff definitely does...)

166mg heroin (street) == 10mg morphine == 10mg methadone.

That's pure madness. Should a newbie user who's iv'ed 10mg morphine decided to all of a sudden insufflate or iv 166mg of H, they might get in trouble! **(note: do not do it!**)

I think the problem is that websites tend to just assume all street H is weak (10-20% purity) and therefore come up with wild assumptions.

So yesterday after we got off work together, my friend (M) and I were gonna see our boy. I asked our guy if he could front me half a bun yesterday because today I was picking up 3 buns from him and would have the $ today. No problem. 

So M is like let's put our tips together and grab a deal on some bags and split it. So I'm like okay. We had $60, $35 of that being mine. And because she mouthed off we didn't get any extra bags for the 60 - just 6. So M decided that by ""split it"" apparently I agreed to split EVERYTHING including my half a bun that I bought separately?? Wtf. So when we were together I had gotten ONE bag out of the 6 that we put money together for and she got the other 5, and is saying ""well you got 6 bags I got 5, you said we were splitting everything now you're changing it"" WTF! Why would I ever agree to in total paying $80 to get 6 bags... I intended to keep my 5 bags that were MINE, and split the 6 bags three and three. And when I said something she brought up that she's given me deals on subs before as if that had ANYTHING to do with yesterday or like I ever asked for that, she's the one who always offered to throw me an extra sub the 2 times I bought from her. 

Smh. At least I got to watch my dboy choke her out when she mouthed off to him, cursed him out, and slammed the brakes on his car. 👍🏼



TLDR- think my friend just used me throwing down $ to get herself well. I didn't get any of those bags. She's a lil cunt and I got to see her get choked out anyway. Fuck the game

Downers are pretty much mandatory when the shit wears off. Also, what is considered a blocking dose of 'done? I usually take about 50-60 mg , and get a good nod most of the time. Took 60 mg today. If I take the oxy tomorrow or the next day, are my receptors still going to be saturated? I just don't wanna waste the precious 40s. Sometimes I'll take a few done a few hours before the oxy  as well, to get the most out of em.

I mean, I feel that I'm simply stating fact when I say to my loved ones that I simply cannot be content in the slightest while I work my ass off day in and day out to serve disgusting product (condensed deli meat) to outrageously disrespectful customers and working with people whom I prefer NOT to say are fools but must be if they are okay with all of this.

I love people. I've no doubt that I'm a likeable guy because I consistently try to be nice, not talk shit about anyone, serve customers with a smile. I work hard, so my boss respects that along with my coworkers because we share the work evenly or I offer to take the heftier load (common when working with older folk). I have a family that I share an incredibly strong bond with; I was brought up on the basis that love IS what makes life, for myself and others, good. I have true and sincere love even for the people that disrespect me.

All that being said, I am living in constant, insufferable misery. I got sober (alcohol being my DOC but opiates were my forbidden love) after I had done a few years worth of damage to loved ones (I'm 22). I've now been sober almost a year, and the clearer my mind becomes, the more frustrated I become with the whole system of government, economics, interpersonal relationships, and lack of excitement life offers in general.

I understand that these are natural feelings for a recovering addict, but what reasons are there to argue that these feelings are not justified when the only ""happiness"" that is offered is money in your pocket and a style of living that either involves taking great financial risk for reward or working your ass off every single day of your life until you die. What the fuck kind of nonsense is this?

The only reason I haven't taken off and traveled the country or relapsed? That love I have for my mother, and my sister. The only issue I have with this, is that I believe they are perpetualizing the lie I so badly want to stick the middle finger to. I actually feel BAD for them, that they feel the need to endure crippling depression/anxiety, financial expenses, and an eternal sense of not being good enough because they can always be ""better"".

I'm a firm believer that if the world were based a little more on morality and less so on money, I'd have a chance at being a siber, happy man, but that will never be possible. Until the day comes that either my family dies or I want to kill myself and refuse to, I'll keep doing this bullshit, coming home a sore mess, saving morally meaningless pieces of paper and buying temporarily gratifying material items with them.

I did it. I have a ton of suboxone and before you ask the reason I chose to start on methadone is to conserve my suboxone for when I'm really going to need it. 

I've been putting on a happy face lately here but the last 6 days on suboxone have been absolutely fucking miserable. Coming to the realization that whenever I make the decision to get clean I'm high and that there's no way around that hurts my brain a little. So I get to Morocco then immediately regret it and kept screaming ""change my ticket I'm going home tomorrow"" to which my dad would respond with ""if you do that I'll have to consider you dead to me."" So I'm like FUCK what did I get myself into. AGAIN. I just gotta keep my cool but it's hard so I'm like ok so there's no suboxone in Morocco I'm gonna get on methadone wtf do I have to lose. 

So I get the heart echo and what not and doctors stuff here runs like streamline. My addiction specialist meets me at the clinic the next morning gives me my dose and says if I'm not feeling well my mom can pick it up from now on (ahhh the perks of 2nd world countries the flexibility). So that's awesome right?

Well..I swallow the pink syrup and immediately recognize that delicious bitter opiate taste I've come to acquire as though it were dark chocolate or one of those nasty beers like an IPA. Five minutes later I feel different, my pupils are even pinned. Two hours later I feel good. Six hours later I'm feeling crippling anxiety and this weird chemical smell. My nerves are also buzzing and I'm crying uncontrollably wtf? 

So do you think those weird side effects will go away once my body gets used to the methadone? Also she told me I can't take gabapentin anymore with the methadone that's gotta be some bulkshit right? Or is she just trying to see what I'm feeling like JUST on methadone? Also for anyone else who is on methadone I would love to hear your experiences of being on it getting off it..anything really. 

Sorry if this was long. Just wanted to share my experience.

I got this KILLER rush and it was glorious. It really shocked me. This one dose still had me high up until about an hour ago.

I hit up my buddy and since he drives, we went to go cop together. We went through my girl, who's usually on point,  instead of my guy who's like THE plug and who I've been getting from lately. She was closer so we went thru her because we were impatient... she kept us waiting longer than it would've to go to him in the first place, and to top it off the bitch cut our shit with melted grocery bag plastic. I couldn't figure out why it would barely run n fucked up the foil and was so gooey. I thought I tasted burning plastic but thought maybe it was the straw...


Then I did a shot and little pieces of garbage bag started showing up after the tar melted off into the water. Fuck me! This has never happened with her before.


So now its the next day and both of us are hurting again (paid $40 for a 50/50 mix 1/2 gram of plastic but decent dope mixed in) .

But my mom says she's saving them for Christmas money.

Do you think it'd be too much of a dick move to shave off like $50 worth? I can pay back the money tomorrow because I've got my sugar daddy picking me up. But I need something to get through til then and I don't want to meet him (sugar daddy) sober.

5zyvo9,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/5zyvo9/51_days_cleannot_here_to_brag/,8,https://redd.it/5zyvo9,843tanshoes,51 days clean...not here to brag,"I just want to tell you that there is hope. I considered my self a hopeless piece of shit who was too weak to ever get clean. Of course I had to hit my bottom to be ready, and that bottom was contemplating suicide every single day to escape this, Groundhog Day (starring Bill Murray), cycle. The dope wasn't working anymore. There were no highs just dopesick, or feeling fine for a few hours. No matter how much I did it just wasn't doing what it used to.

So I went to inpatient treatment in Alabama, and of course being an agnostic I was beyond skeptical of the 12 steps thinking it was some religious bullshit, but being at my lowest point ever I had nothing to lose and just tried to be open minded, because I thought fuck it's got to be easier than waking up dope sick, hustling money up, and chasing dope all day.

I'm not going to go into all the steps, but the first three are the cornerstones of this program and if you don't wholeheartedly do those. The rest isn't going to work.

So step one: Admitting I am powerless over drugs and Alcohol and that my life has become unmanageable. With just the tiniest bit of reflection that was easy for me to accept, and I read tons of posts on here of people verbalizing the same sentiment. If you can't do this one just keep using until your shit gets unmanageable and you realize you are powerless over substances that alter your mind.

Step two: Admitting there is a power greater than ourselves that can restore us to sanity. Which was something I struggled with coming into this program because I was atheist/agnostic, bitter at organized religion and thought that if there was a omnipotent deity he/she/it was an asshole for all the injustices in this world. What helped me here though was the word God was not in the sentence...just a power greater than myself. I thought ""Well fuck there are a lot of things greater than myself. The laws of nature, my family, my friends, these former addicts with years clean who were my counselors at inpatient, and the fellowship of addicts here on r/opiates (with our powers combined a lot of good and harm reduction gets done. Things I've read here have kept me safe, sane, and from killing myself multiple times). I wondered how these were going to ""restore me to sanity"", but that wasn't what this step was asking. It just asked me to admit that there was a power greater than myself, and that it could restore me to sanity. So I put aside all my intellectual bullshit and said, ""Sure, something out there can because this shit seems to work for other people who's stories and rock bottoms seemed worse than mine.""

Step 3. Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God AS WE UNDERSTOOD HIM/HER/IT. This one was even harder than the second step because the idea of turning my will over: 1. Didn't make any sense. 2. Why the fuck would I turn my will over to something I was skeptical of existing in the first place and 3. If it was ""God"" as I understood him; which to me meant I was making up my own conception of ""God"", wouldn't that make me ""God. I was told to stop being a narcissist and to quit over thinking it. So I kinda looked at in the sense that we as human beings have tiny peanut brains that aren't able to conceptualize or understand the inner workings of the universe and that I need to stop trying to figure out The who, what, why, and simplify it. So I just dropped all the semantics and just started praying to a power greater than myself or the divine spirit of the universe, and became open to the idea of the universe not just being chaotic. There are too many coincidences for shit to be by chance. I don't give a fuck if my higher power is blond haired blue eyed Jesus, the Hare Krishna, a ball of condensed matter or what. The blessing of sobriety and and the blessings of those I pray for are enough proof that something is running the show, and listens. Because when I was void of spirituality and trying to control everything and everyone around me I couldn't stay clean for longer than 3 hours, and my life was falling apart. (After this paragraph I will not use the word ""God"" again.)

Now this shit wasn't all sunshine, rainbows, and back to back orgasms. The detox sucked, and it took me 8 days to start really being able to eat food. On day 3 my insurance decided it wasn't go to pay anything, but because the treatment center had told me everything was good with my insurance and to pack my bags and drive down there from another state, and I threatened to get a lawyer involved they put me on ""scholarship"". (Essentially a tax write off.) 

That same day my Dad called me, and informed me that my girlfriend of 2.5 years was done with me and to not call her or press the issue. I was hurt, pissed, confused, and just completely overwhelmed. I would be lying if I said I didn't think about killing my self right then and there. I went outside and started throwing chairs, punching trees, and cursing her. After having my little rage fit I had this weird moment of introspection. I no longer had to worry about maintaining a long distance relationship, I could focus solely on getting better, realized that she was an addict as well just not to the same substance or as far progressed as I was, and that after all we had been through together, and all the times I was there for her...In my time of need she wasn't. Totally not a ride or die. So this coincidence was the universe doing for me what I couldn't do for myself.

About day 5 my car got repossessed, but I knew that was coming so that wasn't as much as a shock as it was a relief to finally have some closure.

I was really lucky to be in a group with two other guys who were skateboarders and had been through the program gotten clean time, and had stopped doing the things they were supposed to after becoming complacent. Their experiences really helped me see that you have to put in some work to stay clean. You aren't just magically cured. This disease is for life. We can't cure it, just put it into remission.

One of the things I kept hearing was ""our best decisions were the things that led us to rehab."" This kind of pissed me off, but I understood it wasn't pertaining to every aspect of my life. So my plan was to stop listening to junkie jimminy cricket in my head, and start doing the exact opposite and see how that worked. I remember sitting down to talk about vivitrol and my mind trying to make a million excuses as to why I shouldn't sign the release, but I forced myself to do it. My plan was to detox and go back home and get back to work. I was told my multiple people both counselors and other patients, that sober living is really needed for long term success. So again I ignored the voice telling me not to go, and made arrangements to go to sober living after I was discharged.

I go to Intensive Outpatient Therapy 5 days a week NA/AA/orHA meetings 7 days a week. We also do a study group based around the AA book, a 12 step study course, I'm working on a community garden here, and my two skater homies from rehab found a piece of railroad track and made a flat bar, and are building a cinderblock ledge with angle Iron. I have a rad sponsor and am working on step 4 right now. The weekends are mostly free time so I try to skate as much as possible, keep in touch with my parents, little brothers, and friends from back home who are amazingly supportive and were unaware I was using heroin.

I really don't know how to sum all this up because I'm still working on this. I still have using dreams, I still have thoughts about how nice a fat shot of dope would be, and I still have a lot of fucked up external shit to deal with. My dad is on a heart transplant list, my credit and finances are fucked, and I'm literally hundreds of miles away from my friends and family. I do know that relapsing and going back to dope isn't going to fix any of that shit. It might make me temporarily forget, but it would only cause me to lose more, become more alienated, and possibly kill my dad from the sheer stress on his heart.

Two weeks ago I attended the funeral of a fellow  skateboarder and heroin addict. He was an amazing skateboarder and if he hadn't have gotten fucked up he no bullshit had the potential to go pro. He was already flow for multiple companies and had video parts that were ahead of his time. He was 27 when he left the program he was in and died the first time he used again. I watched his family and friends weep over his lifeless corpse. His mother and sister were hysterical. I'm crying right now just thinking back to this. I vowed to never put my family through that kind of pain and my two friends I skate with here at sober living did the same. He died so we can live. Why disrespect his memory by not realizing the depth of his sacrifice.

They say if you stick around in this program to buy a suit...because you are going to attend a lot of funerals. Not everyone gives themselves to this program fully and wether an accidental OD or suicide because of the shame of failing it's something that happens too often.

I worry about my good friend u/423nods everyday, and pray that she might find her way to this life I've found. I whole heartedly apologize to you if you are reading this. I couldn't continue talking to you because it was really sending me into a bad place emotionally, and if I was going to stay clean it has to be this way until you get some help. This shit is life or death to me. I might have another run in me, but I know I don't have another recovery. I know you like the idea of being clean one day, but I don't know if you are ready to go to any lengths to get clean. Just know I love you so so so so so so so so fucking much, and I think about you and pray for you every day. You were and are my Junkie Guardian Angel. 💚 you, you little nurse Jackie.

As to the rest of you here on r/opiates: I wish you all the best, and hope that your path in life leads you to happiness, health, and prosperity. I'll be praying and meditating for each and every one of you. The 12 steps worked for me so far  so that's all I can attest to. If you are on the fence about asking for help just take the plunge. My boss, my parents, and even my ex were really supportive of my decision and just wanted me to get better. If you are afraid of losing things just know that you will lose the eventually from using. To those of you new to this place and this particular class of substances please just quit while you are ahead. Before your body and mind become dependent.

Thanks for letting me share, 
A once hopeless heroin addict named Greg

Over the past six months I've found myself scoring more. My tolerance is super high and until a few weeks ago I hadn't even heard of CWE. My wife knows about my use, and doesn't use herself. She's worried about me. Especially considering how much apap I was ingesting and how much money I was spending. We had a long talk and I said I'd stick to just what the doctor gives me and let her dole it out to me.

It's day three and Jesus Christ this sucks. I know a lot of you have it way worse. I'd never do H, for one I know a lot of people who have died from it, and for two it's not in my area, at all. However I'm to the point now where 80 mg of oxy or hydros is just getting me off and it doesn't last long. 

I'm not puking, but I'm fucking depressed, I can't stay off the toilet, I have to work overnights on top of this bullshit and to top it all off, refill day, the best day of the month, is going to be hampered by my wife who is genuinely concerned about me. I'm concerned about me. I know a lot of the reason I do this is because I have unresolved issues from my past, and addiction runs in my family.

I just don't know what to do, I've been at work for 10 hours tonight and when I go home I'm going to lay in bed and toss and turn and shit 29 times before sleep even becomes a thought I can entertain.

I'm just going to move on and if he wants to continue ripping and running and hurting people then sooner or later like you guys said it'll catch up with him. Fuck this guy. He's a piece of shit and he'll continue to live like one. I don't have to stoop to his level. 

This is a story of how I got robbed $6000 cash and an important iPhone with sentimental value..

So I am kind of naive and stupid and too trusting of people. I'm 22 years old heroin addict, been in recovery and out for about 2 years. I've been to multiple sober living houses, meeting a new group of people at each one, and at one of them I got robbed big time... I got my PS4 stolen 2 months before this which I thought was bad... not compared to this though.

 So at one of the sober living houses I had this roommate who I became ""friends"" with... who was also a heroin addict. Let's call him Corey. He was 4-5 years older than me, we became friends within a few weeks but he was very sketchy and slick... he's the #1 sales rep at this telemarketing firm too so he's good at conning and manipulating. He brags all the time to me of how good of a ""mouthpiece"" he has and how he makes so much money... so I just asked just out of curiosity one time how I can make money because I wasn't working at the time.

I wasn't inquiring on doing anything illegal, just wanted to see if this so-called money maker had any tips. Anyways, he tells me I can double my money by flipping some weed... which immediately made me uncomfortable.. I didn't want to partake in that cause I was sober and wanted to live a healthy lifestyle but he eventually got me to cave into the idea.. he made it easier for me to relapse on heroin later by bringing it back and giving me a shot. He was using the whole time he was there, I don't even know why he was let in the halfway house cause he pissed dirty. The manager just wanted money and not have an empty bed I guess -.-. Fucking sober living are a business.

So I actually withdrew 6000 and had an envelope full of 20s. was the most money I ever  had... I had to give it to him for him to do the deal... oh.. why did I do that... one of the biggest mistakes I'll ever make in life but an expensive lesson indeed. The funny thing is, he needed my phone too cause his wasn't working, and I couldn't muster the thought that someone would do such a wrong to somebody by taking their phone and cash that they were friends with... turns out I was not picking the right friends.

anyways... he said I couldn't come with him to do the deal or whatever, and that should of been a clear RED FLAG to stay the fuck away from this guy and not give him my money but let me tell you he is a really really good manipulator being #1 sales rep... It was still extremely stupid for me to hand him the money basically and trust him to not fuck me over, but that's what he ultimately did. He ran off, went to a fancy hotel because a girl he used to see helped set him up, however he got away. He basically pissed away all that money.. 

I looked him up on google, and he has charges for forgery and had a warrant for his arrest. I can't believe I didn't check that sooner before I got robbed. I fell into a really bad depression after this, and I still have trouble getting over it. I was going to press charges against him for the robbery,all the people at the sober house took my side and would defend me, but I eventually gave up seeing that it probably wouldn't amount to much since it was cash and there weren't much indicators of a robbery since I basically handed him the money... I got news he went to prison for forgery though which made me happy. I was hoping his scumbag white ass got his ass beat in there. He was there for a few months but he got out a few months ago.  

I ran into him actually at a NA meeting, and right when I walked in, he dipped out and didn't come back. The coward didn't even have the balls to apologize or say shit. People tell me to get over this resentment, but this is one of the biggest scumbags I know and that was a lot of money. I don't know, I know the sober living he's at now. I know that he still works at that scumbag telemarketing company. I know that he doesn't care that he robbed me and that I am wasting energy on this while he could care less...  

I want to do something to hurt him tho. What are some ways I can get petty revenge?  I have his name address, fuck I contacted his mother demanding her to get him to pay me back but he is estranged and she called him a ""lost cause"" lol. Even his family gave up on him, he has two kids too but I doubt he gives a shit and is a deadbeat dad. I fucking hate this guy so much. 

**when he blocked me on facebook right after the incident, my friend showed me a post on facebook of Corey giving FUCKING STARBUCKS to a homeless person putting his status that people need to be generous and not be selfish and shit!!!!

608eqy,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/608eqy/methadone_maintenance/,11,https://redd.it/608eqy,whosjimi,Methadone Maintenance,"I'm an ""almost"" clean addict from opiates. Oxy specifically. I've battled this addiction for almost 11 years now. I'm going to be 25 this year and i still feel like I'm inside the body of an addict that mentally can't take on the roll of being ""almost"" clean. Some of you may disagree. Some say I am clean, some say I wish I was.

When i was 14 i was diagnosed with chronic kidney stones, i was given my first pain pill and floated away on my solo cloud playing Super Mario Bros for the very first time. The same year i decided to go to an alternative school to graduate early and try to manage the pain. I finished school in the fall of 2008. I walked in January 2009 at the age of 17. At this point i was a daily user. Taking around 10-15 hydrocodone 10's each day trying to mask the pain i only ""occasionally"" had. But my tolerance built up and my mind kept playing tricks on me, whispering that more wouldn't hurt. I'm 19 now, waiting tables to fuil my opiate addiction that was now at a whopping 35-40 pills each day just to not be sick. I'm desperate, stealing from people i hardly knew just to get high. I was able to feed this addiction for a few years without worry, but my reputation was taking a horrible turn. Thief. Liar. Whore. Junkie. You name it. I finally got desperate enough to go to rehab, and completed successfully. Three weeks later i found myself knocking on the same doors, taking the same pills. That's when my step-mother introduced me to methadone. I instantly felt different. I felt like I could live again.

I find myself taking 120 mgs a day very quickly. Adding xanax to the mix daily just to feel a little different. Land myself on probation for possession of ativan and pot, still used and didn't give a fuck. That's when I met him. October 2013. Today we'll call him Corey (its the first fucking name that popped into my head.) He sold xanax and he liked Modest Mouse. It was a dream come true for freshly 21 year old me. We find ourselves in the hospital January 2014 because I was having kidney complications. Surprise! I'm pregnant with a massive kidney infection. I place my head in my hands and sobbed for what felt like forever. The next day I'm sick. Unable to hold down food, or medicine, let alone the methadone I knew I shouldn't even be taking still. I see 5 different doctors in 2 weeks, lose 20 pounds and the ability to walk on my own. (Im 4'11 and 110 pounds normally) so i didn't have much to lose being a first time mother. No diagnoses. No cure. Just me unable to take methadone, pregnant, dying and very confused with everything at this point. My vision was blurry, my skin was grey, I didn't want to be alive anymore. On January 14 I'm stil trying to get methadone inside of me to stop some of my pain. Corey drags me up the steps and into the front door. The receptionist took one look at me and called the ambulance. That's when everything went dark.

Doctors are jamming shit in all areas, searching for the cause, I'm slobbering on myself, pissing myself, shitting myself. I'm hovering over myself in this hospital room. I hear my father's voice for the first time. He leads me into a giant room filled with check out booths. I have to go through each one to complete my final stages of life. The song ""Carry on my Wayward Son was playing throughout this giant room, as i inch closer to the end the song gets louder and the light got brighter. My dad took my hands and reassured me ""he would be fine and that i could be free now."" I remember not even thinking twice about it, i went for that fucking light. I'm almost completely inside until I'm ripped away from this entire scene and back inside of my hospital room hovering above the madness. I was just shocked back into sinus rythym and began breathing again, I was without a pulse for 3 minutes. From then on I slowly recovered from what had been Septicimia in it's most deadly form. My son and I survived that horrific incident, I was medically detoxed from methadone and had a healthy pregnancy.

My son is born perfectly healthy. But, a custody battle from hell insued. My past haunted me and I was lucky to win joint-custody from a drug dealer with a clean record. I found myself using oxy again for what I called ""energy"" to deal with the day, but it took zero time at all for me to lose interest in my child and everything else around me. I violated probation and found myself back at the front door of the Methadone clinic. I did well again for 9 months, got my life in order, was being a mother to my son and was participating in every day life. It wasn't long until I then found myself puking in a jail cell withdrawing from Methadone, finally serving out my time for a crime committed almost 3 years prior. The state of Texas wasn't happy with me and sentenced me to 10 months in the county jail (my crimes were misdemeanors.) 257 days I spent in the same cell, with the same officers, and the same nasty women. It was in jail I found my hobby. I learned i was very good at creating shit with map pencils, it's something I still do today. I was released from my extremely long sentence, I was just someone to make an example out of.

Corey welcomed me out with open arms and an open invitation to spend time with my son whenever I wanted. It was a dream come true for someone that had no idea what to expect. It wasn't six days out that I found myself taking pain pills again. Like, what the fuck?! I didn't let it last long, I went and sought-after help at the same damn place. Now i take 30 mgs of Methadone every day. I'm able to be a mother to my son, but I'm rotting away on this medication each and every day. I want to be fully free. What the fuck does someone like me do?",1489897208.0

I see guys in here who stay a week without shit, and sincerely, I know don't how the fuck it is possible, if I stay 3 days without poop, I have the most incomfort in my stomach, together with stomach pains, and the urge to shit every moment of my day, even if i stay hours in the toilet, i can't poop. My maximum days without pooping were 4 days, and it was awful, I used a laxative this time, and it really do the job, but with many side effects too, if u use them often, as i was reading about them. 

So, I decided to change my eating habits, because I can't deal with this problem. I always ate bad (shitty foods, fast foods, sodas, etc), I didn't have lunch time or dinner time, I ate when I am hungry, I would sleep after a big fat meal, and all this participate in the constipation problem.

Sorry bout the bad english, I am not american, but I'm trying hahahha 

So, after the 4 days without poop episode, I decided that I would eat better, and have eating habits. I have a daily use of oxy/morphine, in the morning to start my day, I usually take 20-30mg of oxy, and in the night, I usually plug 60-90mg of morph, I know this is a small habit (just because of money) compared to some people here, but even theses low doses gave me the constipation problem. Before starting opiates, I would poop 3 times a day hahahah 

I started to eat things that I don't normally eat, a diet rich in fibers, started to drink just water, and cut the sodas, and it helped me a lot, today I poop from 1-2 times a day.

Everyday in my lunch, I eat a salad, made with:

-lettuce: rich in fibers, helps with digestion, and the proper bowel functioning, plus a lot of vitamins, and calcium.

-carrot: rich in fibers too, and with a lot of vitamins included, and antioxidants.

-beet: I think the most rich in fiber in this diet, it has zinc, and a lot of others vitamins, like B and C.

-broccoli: rich in fibers, potassium, vitamins, protein, and broccoli is good tasting hahahahah

In my evening I normally eat a portion of:

-oat: it is a cereal, very rich in fibers, vitamins E and K, calcium, iron.

-linseed: rich in fibers, omega 3, vitamins and others stuff (2 spoons are the necessary)

-chia seeds: fibers, omega 3, and antioxidants (1 spoon)

I mixture this 3 with milk, and add a corn flakes, and cinammon to make it taste better.

I eat a cup of yogurt too (here in brazil, we have a yogurt with probiotics, which is a bacteria Bifidobacterium animalis DN173010, this bacteria is produced naturally in our bowels and help the bowel movements too), don't know if this is avaiable in others countries, but yogurt itself helps the bowels too.

And remember the most important thing: WATER, I drink 1-2liters everyday. If u not drink much water, the fibers can do the reverse effect, and not help us poop!

With this new diet, I can finally go to the bathroom everyday, without having problems! Hope it help someone, I decided to share this, because it is helping me a lot with this problem (for me the only bad thing from opis). If u add this kind of food to your diet, I am sure it will help, u don't need to stop eating your normal food, just add this to your lunch, and dinner. Hope u guys are alright!",1489893482.0

606z1x,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/606z1x/4_years_later/,31,https://redd.it/606z1x,The_Revolutionary,4 years later,"Like many opiate addicts I started off with free time, curiosity, and naivety toward the power of prescription pills.  My once thriving pot business quickly turned into nothing but pills, and all of my childhood friends and acquaintances into addicts of varying degrees.

Florida was still boom town. Every week I'd get hundreds of 15s, 30s, 40s, and 80s in the mail. After a short few months I'd accrued close to 90k dollars. I found the needle. In a few short months again I was broke and in rehab wondering what happened.

I went to meetings in kind of a haze for about a year and stayed in the town I went to rehab in in an Oxford House. ""One day at a time"" ""Let go or be dragged"" ""if you're eating a shit sandwich chances are you ordered it"". 

Then one morning I got the first call I'd ever had where someone young I knew lost their life. My childhood friend and smoking buddy and client I'd turned onto pills, old bus pal from school days. He'd died nodded off at the wheel, wrecked his car. I had kinda a rough time and started thinking about using.


Then I got the call that my brother died, he was being bullied and committed suicide. I relapsed on the way home on some mscontin, and I entered my darkest days. Heroin was around now, the Florida pipeline had been shut down. I found some connects naturally and started middle manning to support myself. 


A few months later I found the guy who'd picked on my brother through a local chick. She called me and said he wanted to smoke with her in the woods and she told me where they were going. I snorted 4 30s, left, found them and told him what was going to happen to him and then I beat him for a while and left him there and took the girl with me. 


I very clearly remember weeping and bellowing as loudly as I could that night. I was pounding my fists on the floor of my house until they were bruised and rug burned, just hoping someone would hear me and see if I was okay. I wanted to die. I wanted to know why I ended up here. Everything happens for a reason right? I learned roughly it doesn't have to be a good reason.



I went to California after stealing some weed from a local dude and tried getting clean again. After a month or so I got the call that the police were at my family's homes looking for me in connection with the assault, and I journeyed across the country again because I didn't wanna be caught out west and extradited.



When I got back I hired a lawyer and went to court and learned what really happened. Dude had broken eye sockets, nose, cheeks, missing half an ear, and surgery to save one eye. Some fucking how ended up with 4 years intensive probation with a 4 year suspended sentence. Here's where shit got hard.


I never stopped using, they put me in drug court, they locked me up every other weekend, I kept using. I remember just wanting to stop and not being able to. Fuck them. That voice never left my mind that I wanted to get high. Jail all the fucking time it felt like. Then they finally sent me away for 6 months, half in county, half in DOC program. I couldn't escape the constant litany of voices and urges and triggers. I had a kid being born in 5 months. Then my friends really started dying while I was locked up. Left and right, suicide and overdose, murder and car crashes.



I really wish I knew what changed for me. One day I just realized if I didn't change soon I'd be this way forever. One day my mind just stopped obsessing. One day I just became a Dad. One day I realized after 2 weeks I was as clean as I was gonna get and it was about my thinking now and not the drugs. One day my head got better. One day yours can too. And now it's been four years since I've had a craving to use. I just remember asking myself...

606dt2,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/606dt2/a_fairytale_christmas_part_1/,7,https://redd.it/606dt2,aVacantStare,"A Fairytale Christmas, Part 1","Morning. I instantly shiver as the frigid air of the unheated house attacks my ragged skin. I thought I would be able to sleep until at least 11. A junkie always wakes up earlier than he hopes. Whether he has money or not. A junkie flush with treasure and poison wakes up early to indulge in his slice of heaven, instinctively, involuntarily. A junkie whose fortune is barren and bleak wakes up to get ahead of the day, to take advantage of the waning moments of wellness. More time to hatch mediocre plans, that almost always go astray.

I come to my senses, and quickly come to the conclusion that the dreaded day has arrived. I have robbed, scammed, colluded and convinced myself into a corner. There is nothing for me. 

I check a cotton in my battered spoon. The implement that I like to believe had once served happy Americans chicken noodle soup and Fruity Pebbles was now a sinister cog in the wheel of my self destruction. The heroin has been anything but lately. The fentanyl barely leaves a trace. The dope the rude Cape Verdean teens have been serving us looks and tastes more confection than drug, but i crave the painful rush and fleeting warmth it provides.

It was supposed to be different. 6 months ago I had left New York City. I had tried and failed multiple times to get clean. But this time seemed different. I checked myself into (a detox) in November with a lust for life i hadnt felt before.

The suboxone in detox was a cruel ruse, it made me feel better. It made me comfortable. I made a friend in detox and we thought we ought to go to a sober house together. It only took minutes for our plan to shift from ""find a safe environment that will facilitate our recovery"" to ""find a scandalous sober home that will look good enough on paper to placate our families, and provide the proper environment to live the dream just one more time.""

Within days of settling into this crack house in everything but a name, the habit and lifestyle i so desparately sought to rid myself of had returned in full force.

(Shitty town) was a terrible place to hustle. My hustle turned into scamming old associates and connects in the club drug scene. Eventually i ran out of options. 

My mother had been under the impression i was on Vivitrol. She didnt question why i begged for hundreds of dollars to get to and from the only doctor that took my insurance in (town). The worst part about deceiving my loved ones was the absense of guilt. The sense of entitlement. The willingness to push the envelope. 

I go from room to room and practically beg my roommates for a cotton. Something. Please help me. It takes probably an hour for me to realize it is Christmas. The beautiful irony of the hellfire I find myself in. The juxtaposition of my divine suffering and empty isolation on the traditional day of love of family and celebration is noted. Normally Christmas would be a good day for a junkie, but i had run out of favors.

I come to terms with my hopeless position and make a last ditch effort. I type the digits into the phone. I remember calling this number when i got into college. When i couldnt cope with the loss of my father. When i couldnt handle another night in the cold van under the BQE.

The familiar loving voice picks up. She always picks up. Her irish accent harkens me back to my childhood. Her lullaby rendition of Roy Orbison ""the Sandman"" used to carry me gently to sleep and comfort. I am hoping she will carry me to comfort one final time.

Parents hate giving junkie children money. Once the ship sails its very hard to get it back to port. But my beautiful irish mother also wants to protect me. I explain to her how I owe my roommate 50 dollars and he needs it to get back to (town) to spend Christmas with his children. He just got out of prison, mom, please dont let me be the reason he doesnt get to be there for his family.

She objects, relents, objects and relents. The cycle continues for what seems like hoursl, but the persistent onslaught of a withdrawing opiate addicts' pleas and reasonable albeit deceitful ramblings drills through the crumbling wall of resistance with the ease of a jackhammer striking drywall.

I almost instantly feel better knowing it will come today. Dopesickness is strange like that.

The worst part about my living situation is knowing the dope is right next door. The kid living one room over has blue bundles from (a town), the fading industrial town on the south coast of Massachusetts whose monopoly on Portugese junkies is unmatched this side of the atlantic. 

My mother sends me the tracking numbers for the MoneyGram and I excitedly run to my Portugese savior.

(Part 2 tomorrow, things get a little interesting)

I am 18 months sober and loving my life. I love you all and hope you are all high or not sick :) cheers

 I met up with my ex-gf last night to go back to our hometown. We make it to the train and need to get high. I go to the Metra bathroom and cook us each up a nice shot. I bang mine and come out the bathroom, then send her in so she can do hers. Im waiting out in my seat for what seems like wayyy too long when our stop comes and goes. 

Now Im banging on the locked door and..... nothing. I'm pretty sure I know whats going on now so I go find the conductor. I tell her I thing my GF has passed out drunk in bathroom and that we missed her stop. When I get her to open the door, there she is, on the floor, eyes open not moving, and she's a little blue. I quickly pick her up in my arms and get her to the door of the train as the train pulls up at the next stop (only 1 stop past mine, so im familiar with it). I tell the conductor that she just drank too much (barely believable given the scene) and the train leaves just as it should. The people on the platform are looking at us a little weird but I manage to get them to go away. Im talking to the GF and shes in and out with a thousand yard stare.I wouldn't even call it talking to her, but she's not DEAD DEAD. 

At this point I grab my IM Narcan which I've had in my pocket since I started walking to the bathroom. I load it up and IM it right in her ass cheek. It took about 5 minutes for full fluidity to return, but she came back. As we're walking out the station an officer asks us if we've seen any passed out people. We say no and book it. A passenger on the platform must've called them after walking away.

Theres also no way I can pass. Should I get fake piss? I wasn't monitored the first one but after this I'm not sure. Should I skip town?

Doesn't seem like much but I did get high (not a regular drug user at all), it was 10mg codeine per 5ml of syrup with guaifenesin 

On Wendsday at 2pm I have to take a drug test. They do pretty fancy tests, (LC/MS/MS for those familiar with the term) and have found things like Kratom in my system 5 days after using, and they have a cutoff level of 1 single digit (Like, when I first started drug court it took me like 3 months to get 9 nanograms of thc out of me so i could start testing clean. I think their cutoff levels are around 1 nanogram for that because of the LC/MS system) they also test for metabolites and stuff.

I'm a relatively big dude (6""2 220) with a slow metabolism which I think might be a reason for things like Kratom popping up.

I know if I read online it says codeine is out after 2-3 days but i'm skeptical because of these higher quality drug tests that this facility has. I've also read kratom is out of your system in hours but failed for that after a few days clean.)

Instead, I have been buying from a highschool friend who had a hook up. It started. . . hell, I honestly don't remember how it started. But, i do remember that, initially, I started purchasing 4x 30mg pills once every month (that's when my dealers hook up got the script filled assumedly). I only took a pill per week. 15mg friday night and 15mg sat night. That went on for maybe 8 months or a year. 

Then I went to law school and kinda forgot about the hook up (I think maybe my dealer had a hook up problem and I just tapered off). But, during my second year of lawschool, dealer let me know he was back in business.  I started back and was buying 6 per month. Only ever taking on friday and sat nights but upping the dosage a bit to ~22mg. That didn't last thought because I didn't have class on fridays --- i.e. there was no reason for me not to party on thursday night as well as fri and sat. So, I started buying eight at a time and taking thrus-sat night. Started taking on Sunday night too, cause why the fuck not?  This carried on throughout the rest of my time at lawschool. 8 pills, every month thursday -sunday of every week. Some of you math wizzs may be saying, ""that doesn't add up."" You're right. Every 4th weekend, I went without. no roxy at all on the 4th weekend of the month. But you bet your ass i was headed back to my hometown that next weekend to re-up. 

Graduated from lawschool last may and now I am working a really great job making good money as an attorney. For the last 7 months, I have been buying 10-12 pills every month --- taking every single friday thru sunday night with the occasional splurge on a random week night. 

Last month, I was feeling a little worried about my usage so I decided I needed to pump the breaks and not reup for march or april. Told my dealer on my last reup as much as well. But, of course, when time came this last weekend to take the break, I just couldn't help myself from texting him to go re-up. Dealer texted me back and told me that he was cashed and he couldn't get a hold of anymore.. . 

I knew this day was coming. The day when I would text and he would no longer have the hook up. I never planned for this to go on for ever and I figured the day my one source dried up, I'd be forced to just move on and quit using. Its why I never told a soul about my usage. Its why I have never looked for anther hook-up. Well, that day seems to have arrived.

I feel slightly guilty coming here looking for advice when I know the vast majority of you here on this sub are mcuh more serious users and far more compelling addiction problems.  I've never had any ""physical withdrawal symptoms."" Never gotten dope sick from not using. I tried my best to structure my usage so I would never get physically addicted.  But man, it is super clear that I am psychologically addicted.  I am just so fucking agitated that I don't have my sunday afternoon dose in me right now. I was pissed friday night, sad saturday, and craving everything under the sun saturday night.  I already really miss getting fucked up and its only been one weekend without. 

I guess I've just come here to ask ""for how long am I going to have to deal with this psychological aggervation?"" Like, I'm sure there will never be a time in my life when I don't think ""man, I would definitely do some roxy right now."" I knew that getting into this.  But this level of craving is really powerful. Like I'm sad that there aren't a few roxys in my cabinet, just waiting for friday night to roll around. It's dominating every thought. I can live with a normal level of ""damn, I wish I had some pain-killers in me,"" but this is just distracting.

I find heroin very very pleasureable and the best opiate.

is nothing superior to IV morphing or morphinen sulphate tablets in a pain scenario?

in a whorld where pure diamorphine is an option in hospitals -- IV fenatyl, could these be better? 
what's the need in 2 why is there a market for heroin and not straight morphing like the old Burroughs days 

I've never tried rate sight morphine outside of a hospital setting and since 

*codeine is converted to morphine, it's weasked but very similar I would imagine at 300-400mg.

without anti histamine - codeine / morphing high is itchy, warm buzzy and makes my face warm. 
2-3 hours of euphoria and heavy limbs.

I can get both codeine and dihydrocodeine, I like the redosing aspect of dhc, but I won't lie there's no rush or ""oh my god I'm high""
with 200mh dihydrocodeine.

do you what happens when dhc enters the blood and why it's not converted to morphine like codeine phosphate?

why are both needed to exist medically?

He doesn't seem sloppy or like a junkie per say, but is noticeably different at times and very forgetful (forgets entire conversations). I am fairly confident he uses daily, breaking up a 30 mg oxy. I've also found xanax, gabapentin, and varying doses of oxy. 

Background: I have a sibling who is a heroin addict, and have seen a relapsing habit take down a promising future. 

I am worried at this point about the trust in our relationship, and the fact that I feel alone. I have tried on a few occasions to express how his actions  make me feel, instead of simply yelling at him to stop. I can't seem to get my point across though because nothing has changed. I know he struggles with anxiety, as do I, yet I have never heard him productively talk about it. I see a therapist regularly and try my best to manage my symptoms in ways that work for me. If opiates help his anxiety I have nothing against that, but his lying and self-medication I have a problem with. 
I don't think he sees how he is lying/with holding the truth, and I know I don't deserve this. I love him, but I am at my wits end here.

I would much prefer to smoke the opium but tea would be okay too. What if I cut the whole plants down in the cover of night, brought them inside and put them in a container with water and a little liquid fertilizer, and then lanced them? Would I get any decent amount of smokable material? Then, considering the fact the plants have to be lanced when they're no longer in the ground, would I get decent tea if after getting what smokable stuff I could from the pods, I made tea out of the pods and straw?

From my understanding, all kinds of letters that are sent to prisoners are thoroughly inspected so that drugs cannot be imported, and to foil any conspiracies to commit crime. However, I feel that a large dose of fentanyl, soaked in blotter paper (perhaps disguised as an image of a loved one) could easily be cut up and distributed. Fentanyl lollipops are absorbed sublingually, and I feel that the same can be done with blotter paper (or left in a bottle cap with some water for a few minutes and snorted, like monkey water). With street fent's low cost and all the doses that could be smuggled in just one correspondence, I imagine there would be a huge profit potential, and they have a better chance of being hidden in a cell than other drugs (not to mention the short duration that the drug would be in a prisoner's system, in case a customer were drug tested).

I am hoping to find a way to use it to help me. I am close to using it in any means possible to off myself if nothing else works.","Hi,


Obvious throw away, since my other account can probably doxxed and I have had real interactions with redditors over the years. I don't know where else to turn (PST sub has gone down?).


Quick break down, I have a medical condition that has left me bed ridden for the last 3 years. I used to have a life, a promising career, and enough smarts to fulfilling life. Doctors would help treat my pain, other medical conditions have left me with having to pick between a life with no pain on opiate use or a shorter life span with semi-efficient, none-opiate, alternatives.


Because my condition doesn't have any ""symptoms"" that can be show on a test (like a broken arm can be seen, if not by x-ray), doctors are skeptical i am just seeking drugs (though, with the costs of an ER visit in the states, I would have to wonder why I wouldn't resort to heroine or the black market for a fix).


Either way, part because there has been no choice, part because I wanted to try to sustain a normal life (I can't go socializing while on opiates, I can only use them to prevent the pain) I have gone 4 years only getting IV opiates twice a year for when I show up a real wreck, and I have been bed ridden for the last 3. The years and career opportunities I have lost and the burden I have become   leaves me here. The doctors, aside from not treating my pain, have no other suggestions either. THIS. IS. IT.


So I find myself here. Unless I can get Canadian or E.U. citizenship (apparently, pain medication is Rx'ed liberally for my condition over there), I am going to have to resort to PST. At this point I am  hoping I can find a way to use it to have a functional life. But I am also at the point at which I am willing to go as far as trying to make it to kill me just for a couple of hours of relief.

I am aware it can kill me, I am not a chemist nor have the means to approach this in the measured manner I can with pills or in the ER. I NEED this to work, I can't go on doing NOTHING with my life (I am not even 30) AND being in the kind of pain I would trade a broken rib for. I am desperate enough to order all the seeds I see mentioned online in mass quantities and run the risk of OD.

At this point, I would like to bring to focus, this isn't a ""I want to end my life, help me"" post... I know where that sub is. This is a ""I am in pain and doctors in my country will not help me, please help me"". With a, ""I have reached the point in my life of pain where accidental death in the pursuit of relief has now taken not so scary prospect"". If this is not meant to work and I am to die from using PST, I would rather have some heads up to spare my family the more gruesome and unforeseen details of my passing's consequences. And please try to paint opiate OD as... whatever it is you think it is/ have experienced... I have OD'ed a couple of times (twice the hospital's doing, one of them leaving me dead for a couple of minutes, and another time by my hand). I know what I am in for and luckily have enough nausea medication to sedate myself and spare my stomach the worst (well, I guess those doctors wouldn't be completely useless then, would they?) Please don't try to scare me about the possibility of OD, just help me avoid it.

I have read all you would find from googling ""PST"". In an earnest attempt to keep living and not kill myself, for my family and myself, is there any current user who could provide some guidance? I know its a touchy subject, even among drug crowd, please feel free to send a PM. I am sorry for the walloftext. I am just desperate for relief and hope.

**TL;DR** I am have been in pain, need to resort to PST. Am desperate enough to be reckless with this, and am in enough constant pain that the chance of OD doesn't seem that scary. I need guidance so I can at least give my parents one last shot at living.",1489941399.0
