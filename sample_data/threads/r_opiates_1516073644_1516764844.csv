The fact is, guys, is that I'm bored. You know who brought sexy back? Yeah, that was me, and it's not as great as you'd think. In fact, it can be a fucking nightmare.. It's winter now, and even as a straight male, I'm so fucking attractive that wherever I go I can use all of erections I'm surrounded by as a coat rack. Fuck, man. Its hard for me to go out in public anymore and the last time I did I ended up in the ER...after I slipped on a pair of wet panties.....Just fuckin' dropped panties and erections everywhere guys. Just let that soak in for a minute.   
  
I just can't fucking take it anymore. My life sucks...I fucking hate this shit. ""But Capn? What about all the dropped panties and erections? You could be the next president of the United States!"" I know what you're thinking, and you're right. There's absolutely nothing normal about it....And I don't want to be fucking president. I wanted the boredom filled nightmare to end for fuck sake. I needed some real excitement.  I needed to be able to feel again.

You ever wonder what it would be like to be the most interesting man in the world? Well, there it is. There becomes a point in your life where nothing else gets your jollys off, and that's where heroin comes in and saves you. Like a nice refreshing cup of coffee.   
  
Because skydiving, racecar driving, wet panties and dodging all the erections just isn't enough for me anymore. I needed to tap into something better, something more pure. The essence of life.

I bought a gram of some rocked up Coke from this dude who sells me Weed, Bars, Pink oxy 10's, coke, and MDMA.

**MOLLY SIDE NOTE -** (His current batch is probably cut with speed/meth. I have ADHD and it feels like Adderall x10 to me. The tan batch I copped once was good tho. I still copped some of this batch tho. Only so I can bang it though.

Anyways, got off track. I got in the shower to bang some yayo because yayo + a hot shower = a moderate skin orgasm.

I fucking missed. To be fair, I haven't banged anything in months. I kinda felt it, but no ear ringing or anything too interesting.

I tried again while on the couch playing the new Dragon Ball FighterZ Open Beta. As I went to prep the shot, I noticed It got wet in the shower....so I used the plunger from the rig to dig the gooey shit out the bag and put it in syringe cap (my cooker). 

I have no clue how much I put in there to be honest. Probably a quarter to half a gram.

I hit the first time, but I just sensed an abcess coming . 

The second attempt was a success.

**SIDE NOTE #2** I want to save the veins in the crook of my arms for dope, but it's so hard to resist. The crook never fails.

I drew back, saw red (fuck yes), and pushed slooowly.

Oh my fuck. THAT SHIT WAS DEMONIC.

Don't get me fucked up. It felt good as fuck. It's just that I legitimately thought that I was going to die.

 I went 78% deaf, got a massive bell ringer, and the things that I *could* hear were very high pitched. It was like sound waves were made of helium.

For at least a full minute, The thought that I should call the amber lamps was running though my head. But then I was like: nah, I'm cool.

I popped a bar about 20 min and now I'm here typing this

Lets talk about the DJ,"the dj is the desperate junkie.  That guy that will pull the most obsurd and shitty stunts to get their fix with no regard for anyone else

 My recent Dj story took place this weekend.  3 of us that use together that know the same common dboy were going to make one run so we could all get our shit. But the dj was insisting we go to his exclusive dboy that only he knew(red flag). After much arguing and drama we finally set in stone we are going to the common dboy
 
 The guy driving decided not to take the dj along for the ride as he is a whiney bitch so the two of us set out with the plan that I would hop dboys car. Cover every ones shit with my money and then collect from everyone and give them their shit
  
Before I bought anything i asked the dj 7 times if he had the money to cover his portion which he defiantly said yes and got mad that I even asked(you see where this is going)  and at this times he asked me to hold all the shit till we got back and give it all to him first so he could pick his bag before anyone else(red flag) fuck that not happening dude

So i get everything. Give the driver his shit and collect the money. No problem.
Get to the dj s house and walk in he immediately greets me at the door and demands his shit ""where's it at give it to me""(red flag)  so following a rule similar to never let your money walk I refused to give him the bag till he gave me the money. He responds ""I got it wtf just give it to me I need a shot I'm sick as fuck""(red flag)  I tell him give me the money or I'm leaving

He grumbles and heads to his bedroom saying ""why are you doing this to me""  comes back empty handed and claims he will have money in two days and to just give him the bag and he'll pay me later.  Fuck that. You lied to me dude I'm outta here.  This kid literally threw himself in front of the door refusing to let me leave. Literally crying and begging me to give it to him.  Tried to wrestle it from me.  Cried some more and a Planted himself in front of the door

Me being a nice guy and generally a sap. I said ill give you a shot so your not sick but them I'm leaving. His response ""no! I need the whole fucking bag I have to go to school Monday I need it""  no dude ill give you a shot that's it
 "" then your giving me the empty bag so I can get the wash from the residue stuck to the baggie""
Are you fucking kidding me?

So I put out a tiny shot and said here dude do this get right and we'll talk about and when he scampered off to get his rig I walked out the door and left. He spent the next 2 hours blowing up my phone begging.threatening and demanding the rest of the bag.  Said he was gonna come to my house and get it I had to threaten him with the police if he showed up there.

Tldr:kid asked me to pick his bag for him. Didn't have money. Tried forcing a front on an empty promise of money later

My name is Jake From The West Coast (No it's not...who are we kidding..but that's what I'm calling myself. Everything else in this post is 100% true) and I've been a long time follower of this site. So many threads have saved me over and over I cant thank this site enough. I've followed it pretty much for 6+ years. I have some quick solutions to detox. Im sure people have posted similar stuff 90000 times here but I felt like sharing my story and im here for any questions. The first two detox I ever went through were without anything and I couldn't imagine doing that ever again. Here's what I do to get off and sometimes stay off **Note. I do have lifetime uncurable nasal condition that causes real, terrible hourly pain**


I'll just say now I dont have the best grammar or spelling. I'm here for telling...not spelling! So if you're a grammar Nazi...you can still read my plan but hold your little snide remarks to your little grammar group. I can just see you guys holding weekly meetings correcting peoples grammar and spelling on twitter and Instagram. 


How long have I used pain meds and a little of my backstory. Scroll down past if you're in serious hurting and don't give a flying fuck about my little story and just need detox tips.
Since 2003 when I had my first sinus surgery. 5mg Norco was the first thing I ever had...It changed my life for the good and bad. I have chronic nasal polyps that causes weekly sinus infections, 20+ operations, no sense of of smell 80-90% less tasting than normal..and constant pressure and pain in my face. I was given 5-10 mg of hydrocodone pretty regularly for the first 5 years as there is no cure for my ailment. its not life threatening but it is considered top 5 worst diseases to live with. Just imagine 50 pound weight on ur head. You have i thin 8 sinus cavities...when you're stuffed up and full blown ""SICK"" you have 1-2 cavaites filled. All 8 of my sinuses caves have been filled since 1996...when I was 10. I'm 32 now. Just this list doctor visit when we agreed on my 21st sinus surgery he finally got me a pain management apportionment. IM praying that I can keep this and dont screw it up. I really want to be normal and have done so for months and years but it's time to do it for good. I didnt get hooked until about 4-5 years ago. I remember the day my friend told me she knew a guy that sold norcos daily. $4 for yellow norcos. Get as many as you want whenever you want (he's now a friend of mine and finally told me how. His friend worked for a drug pharmacy courier and took daily orders. That stopped about 2 years ago when the govt tightened their noose around opiates)

That first purchase of 15 of them changed my life no matter how you look at it. I got up to 30-40 of them at my worst. Im now on day 2 of my 15th-20th detox (i've lost count)...my most recent habit was about 2-3 of them every 3 - 5 hours. roughly anywhere from 12-25 a day. Here's my daily detox guide. Note im no freaking doctor...far from it. Just a functioning addict who lives in daily pain and would like to share with you how I function without pain meds all the time. Also...there is other medication in my list...if you cant get it prescribed or 'Find it' i'll have other options for you..which obviously wont be as good. I have seen the Thomas guide but i knew after reading that fucking bible length guide and my ADHD lazy ass was never sticking to or doing that guide. SO here's the...



LAZY POS FAKE JAKE PAIN PILL DETOX PLAN

My Detox with Prescribed Medication: *Note. I'm currently on disability. I have worked during a detox though and it sucks. You can do it though. But..if there's anyway to get time off please ask for the work week off 5 days. If you cant get that many...try to get a Thursday and friday off so you can plan this. I can't explain to you how much easier it is for me when I can stay in bed and around the house by myself and my GF. I'm also very opiate tolerant. I'll binge for 3-6 months at 10 10mg norcos- 30 10mg norcos a day. Please consider that when doing this. If you have a 2-3 pill a day habit. Take everything I say and cut it in half. If not more. Do research. Have a gameplan.

Medication and amount needed for a 7 day detox. 
(7-12) 10MG Ambien
(3-4) 8MG Suboxone or Subutex
(15-20) .5mg of Ativan or (or (10) 1mg Xanax) 


Details of medication below

(10) 10mg of Ambien (*OTC Ambien substitute. Melatonin 5mg Or a weed edible if you smoke. Ambien can be used like a benzo since it works like one and sometimes i can't tell the difference from ambien and ativan. Albeit i've used ambien on and off for a year. Not reccomended for everyone. Im one of the very few that dont get blacked out off ambien do weird shit besides the time I blacked out and shaved both my eyebrows 3 days before my friends wedding who miraculously called off the wedding...i got lucky ( he did too) )(4) 8mg Subxone broken in 4 2mg quarters (Suboxone substitute if you cant get your hands on it this is emergency only 40mg-60mg of Imodium daily I'll detail this later and dont take it without reading my full story on it). 

(20) .5mg Ativan (Any narcotic anti-anxitey will work. Valium. Klonopin. Ativan. Xanax. Look up the other benzos...the only benzos ive had is Ativan and Xanax.
2mg of Ativan = 1mg of Xanax. I dont know of a OTC substitute that will even remotely come close to these for the mental aspect. IF you wanna get sleepy get benedrayl)

*** If you cant get any of these...the only other medication i've used in a pinch that worked was Soma's. 500mg. 2-3 times a day for 7 days. Also, Kratom Bali strain helped too but it made me through up sometimes so I dont use it. But Kratom has it's great amount of success stories. I would look into that if I were you. It just wasnt my thing *** 

IF you cant get ANYTHING...Scroll to the bottom and read my list of shit i used my 2nd detox when I was a newbie and it helped 50%


I love you. You can fucking do this. I'm not just saying that. IM the laziest...least strong willed person on this planet and im able to stop for long stretches. So can you. Im here for you if you have no one. I'll respond to you all. YOU HAVE TO MENTALLY and Physically prepapre yourself for each detox. It's almost like war. Seriously

**Note 2-5 minimum of 30 min hot showers daily. 4-6 32 oz Gatorades daily.
Day 1: (12 hours after my last dose) This has been a routine. I count my pills...I do my last 2-3 around 2-4am. I wake up around noon...kick the can for a few hours until hour 12 when I take 2mg of suboxone. I know there has been hell of research and posts about when you can take subs. I see some people saying 24-48 hours and i honestly cant believe it. Im sure everyone is a bit differnt and other drugs probably effect the time difference but 12 hours is way enough time at least for me. ( i've taken subs 5 hours after my last dose once on accident...i felt normal and fine) I usually try to stay occupied by watching stuff online, reading sports, playing with my GF cats (they have saved me a lot of sad times), and kind of clock watch. My Gf gets home around 6-7pm we hangout and eat and watch TV. She knows about all of this FYI...she is highly supportive and just wants to see my happy and healthy. MY Anxiety doesn't really kick in until the 24 hour mark of the last pain pill you took. This is when I take anywhere from .5mg of ativan -2mg of Ativan. I get prescribed Ativan recently and its just mainly to help sleep (insomnia) and to kick this shit to be honest. Hour 28 roughly 4am Im ready for bed (night owl) and I take 10-20mg of Ambien. 10mg if im already slightly sleepy. Ambien is a godsend. If I could only pick one drug to get through this it would probably be Ativan but Ambien is a close second. It takes all my worries and restlessness away and I usually sleep well on it. 



Day 2ish: 2pm 36 hours from last dose: 4mg of Suboxone. 4-6 Imodium if stomach is hurting (Imodium is so clutch) 30 minute warm shower ( take a shit ton of showers in the first week. i take 3-5 a day when im detoxing. It helps the muscles and makes you feel better and passes the time) 6pm anxiety is really kicking 2mg of ativan...15 minutes later Im thinking about ice cream and petting my cats..gf shows up from work in a good mood and makes me feel better. 30 min shower (everyday)

Day 3ish: 3pm: The more sleep you can get the better. I cant tell you how much it helps. Also my diet this whole time is a shit load of water and Gatorade. Breads...Sandwiches...and whatever my GF will kindly make. And taking a ton of shits 30 min shower after worst shits.

Hour 63: 5pm 4mg Sub. 2mg ativan. This is usually the worst freaking day so be prepared to have Ativan. 30 minute warm shower (5 showers this day) Sandwich. 3 cups of gatorade. 4mg Imodium. 3 hour nap. shower 30min

Hour 69: 11pm HEY-0!!! 30min shower, 1mg Ativan Im feeling normal and happy. Writing about sports..shooting the shit with friends on text. Looking up funny videos with my GF. playing with the cats. (ANYTHING YOU CAN DO TO KEEP YOUR MIND OCCUPIED AND 30 min shower

Hour 74: 4am 20mg Ambien.... zzzzZZzzzz (sometimes if you wake up and are freaking out. Either take a tiny piece .5mg-1mg of sub or take 1mg ativan and go back to sleep)

Fuck anyone but your dealer but that impossible because you deleted his number ...right ? RIGHT!?!??! Seriously This day and the next 23 are the easiest to forget the mini hell that you just went through and hop back on the opiate train. Please dont. Im a hypocrite tho...I also have daily pain that sucks...not saying im better than you though. We are all the same. You 100% cannot stop until you're ready...have a gameplan..stick to it. Be happy. If that requires a therapist then do it. Its not gonna be all cherry and puppies. You short circuted your brain into months or years of happiness and fun and euphoria...it's gonna balance itself out. I dont think subs are amazing for long term as I do see them as another opiate (opiod) but thats me. If you cant kick h or smoking hella blues...by all means PLEASE go on a year or however long Suboxone maintenance. Please search your areas for a sub doctor. Not any doctor can prescribe Suboxone. oh yea..30 min shower and 32 oz gatorade motherfuckers.

Hour 160: 8pm .25sub (last sub) 30 min shower. 2mg Ativan. Dinner GF decided to treat me to a home cooked meal. Do shit like this to reward yourself and dont beat yourself up. Shit happens to the best of us. The smartest people in the world. The prettiest. The most athletic. Doctors. It's ok...life fucking sucks sometimes. Just pick yourself back up and play with cats. Seriously get a damn cat please. 

Hour 164: Midnight 1mg ativan 32 oz gatorarde 30 min shower. Icy hot all over my damn body. 

Hour 167: I love you all...you've done it . 20mg ambien sleep well, young thugs. It's been real.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now. If you're not able to get any of these or just a mix of these. Whatever you can get it....have a game plan. Say you only can get 4 xanax and 1 sub. Spread those over 5 days. U have to. You can do it. I honestly could do a detox now with 7 ambien 1 sub and a few ativan. But I like to do it comfortable . Sleep is key. Game planning is MAJOR KEY ALERT. Having a safe and warm not choatic house to detox at. Access to bathroom shower/tub kitchen. you're own bed. Im very thankful to have all of that. Please prepare for this. Ask for help. iF you have no friends or family walk into the ER room until they force somewhere to take you. You're gonna get through this . Try not to clock watch. Try not to think about using. Its impossible but at least fight it. You're at war here. Fuck those things. FUck your pos dealer that upcharges through the roof and scoffs at helping you when you're hurting. Fuck the dealer who dont front. FUCK THESE THINGS FOR HELPING AND HURTING ME! I love cats.

Now if you cant get ANYYYYY of these medications. Here is what I did...at your caution.

I've in one sitting taken 30 2mg immodium pills. ANd it helped. I did a ton of research on it. I was desperate. And dare I say it pretty much made me feel normal. Obviously dont do this for more than 4-5 days in a row but Imodium IS a OPIOTE...just a OTC. Just like meth heads did with sudafed ...some guy who coudnt get a hold of his perk30 dealer started popping Imodium until he felt something. It's a dirty high though...so dont do it recerationaly. Seriously. You can skip your heart...cause vision issues. Any longer abuse of it. But in short term Yes 20-60mg is safe. People say it doesnt cross the blood brain barrier to become a true opiate which is kinda true..l just know when i took 20+ of them detoxing i felt like i was on a small dose of norcos. It does block up ur shitting for 48 hours so dont do this long term. 




LAZY POS FAKE JAKE PAIN PILL DETOX PLAN WITHOUT PRESCRIBED MEDS


Day 1-5 (THIS IS FOR THE OPIATE EXPERIENCED ONLY) 20-40mg of imodium daily (skip day 4..dont ever take these things longer than 3 days at time. DO research. This what worked for me ) 10mg of melatonin at night for sleep. Bendaryl for anxiety. ICY HOT Yes this whole plan sucks but it's 50% better than nothing I promise. 

I'll be checking back for anyone that needs help or questions. I might not have been exactly precise but this is almost to the T of what I do every time. (i'm on day 2)


Love you all. Please be safe. Please have a gameplan. Having a gameplan is 80% of the battle.


Peace and Love

Her husband deals and usually he will break her out a line of coke and h and she will do it right away but lately she's had a mirror around with lines laid out on it. She's never had more drugs than she can consume right away so this is very unusual. She's usually yelling at him to get the drugs faster. She calls it her medicine. I've seen her slowly and carefully lie down on the ground and yell for him repeatedly and tell him she either fell down and couldn't get up and thinks she's having a heart attack or that she just came to on the ground and didn't know how she got there. It's happened multiple times. She's also told him in all seriousness that she was going to have a heart attack if she wasn't given more cocaine asap. This is just the tip of the insanity iceberg. 

So not long ago me and the gf go upstairs to buy some dope and she starts talking to us. She tells us that much like Jesus turning water into wine she that she has been turning tums into heroin mixed with cocaine and getting high on it. She then shambled off to the bedroom and returns with a mirror with a line broken out on it and offers it to us. She told us it started off as a tums but now it's dope but that we can't shoot it because of its texture but that she's working on that issue. The roommate says she breaks up the lines and then thinks really hard about dope and it becomes dope. Says its probably because she was a ""CIA kid"". Lol. I took a tiny pinch of the line and tasted it and said yup it's dope. She looked like ""yea duh"". It really was tums. She said she discovered this ability in jail when after she imagined doing a bunch of coke and the imaginary coke getting her high that the doctors came and told her that she had a lethal amount of cocaine in her system lol. 

So fucking nuts. Wish I could recall more details. 

She also told us a few days ago that she was part of ""the 1% of the population that couldn't gets aids"" and that if we knew anyone with aids to let them know they could shoot up her blood for a few days and they'd be cured. 

She truthfully believes all this. She's so batshit crazy that before I went to jail I was going to write her life story for the laughs. Told her it was for writing class smh. Still may do it. She says her dad was ""head of the military"" and her mom was an admiral but they died in a freak top secret submarine accident that gave her bone cancer her whole life. Also the secret submarine is still under Paris to this day.

Me and my friends had this, wooden square made for mountain bikes, but we sat on it and smoked weed all day cause it was a great spot. One day my friend J comes up to the square and says he found this vile on the road. I look at it and its this white power, i think its crack or something. Anyways we dont want anything to do with it so we're fucking around with it, and i jokingly decide to burn the vile with a lighter right under the white powder. Obviously it melted into a liquid and started smoking, now im not a user and never will be, but i know some of you are cringing right now that i just burnt like $300 worth of heroin just to see it smoke. At the time i had no idea what it was of course, but something was really elegant and subtle about the smoke and how it liquefied, and my friend J says to me ""Haha you should take a hit of the smoke"" And obviously i wouldnt do that but in that very moment i was soooo compelled just to huff it right there and see what it did. Thank god i didnt, because after we disposed of the now burnt vile with gunk in it, J's ""mother"" walked up to the square which is weird because a lot of people dont know where it is. She asked J to come talk to her, next thing you know they're shouting. i dont pay attention but i do hear ""WHERE IS IT J?!"" And ""ARE YOU TRYING TO GET ME KILLED LIKE LAST TIME?!"" Well now i know whats up, J stole it from his mother cause shes a fuckin junky bitch and wanted to teach her a lesson. At this point im just thankful i didnt take a whiff of the stuff, cause when he came back to the square he was so mad and told us how he stole a bunch of drugs from her and basically threw them all out except that vile, which he told us was like $300 of china white. And he says to me ""good thing you didnt smoke that, that little bit would have killed you right there"" I didnt even speak. I was flabbergast, i wasnt mad because i know he was joking when he said to take a hit and if i actually had said i was going too he woulda said no dont. But i could have easily took a lethal hit of heroin and there woulda been no time for them to react. I think about it sometimes and it just furthers my opinion on heroin and some opiates

TL;DR Friend stole $300 of china white off his ""mother""

We fuck with it and i burn the vile causing the hereion to liquify and smoke out the top

im really tempted to take a whiff

We weren't as close as some of the others I've lost, but but we said Hi and chatted for a few when we bumped into each other, and I always felt fondly towards him.  He was 26.

The first friend I lost to fentanyl was the worst.  That was back in May of 2016, when it was just getting started here.  He was my best friend, and I think about him every day.  He was my ""hard drug guru"", even though he was like ten years younger than me, he turned me on to Ecstasy and Ketamine, taught me how to snort, and middled all my deals, no charge.  I met him about ten years ago, when I was hanging with a real rough crowd that did a lot of drugs, and I did a lot of drugs with them.  After a couple bad trips, I decided I didn't enjoy psychedelics anymore and stopped using them.  The Ecstasy took their place, but I was doing 8-balls of it to myself in like 48-72 hour sessions and the crash afterward inevitably left me daydreaming about suicide, so eventually I quit doing that.  I never quit ketamine, but something happened to the availability so that the price went up so much I couldn't afford it anymore.

Now over this time, I started to drift apart from the group.  I wasn't getting high everyday anymore, and they weren't as much fun to hang out with when I was sober and they were all fucked up.  I did still use sometimes, sometimes alone and sometimes with some or all of the group, and things were generally good.  One of the group members had a psychotic break, thought I was his archenemy and tried to fight me one night (200lb. sober guy being feebly attacked by 80lb. schizophrenic on a multi-day speed bender, let's just say I won without difficulty and without fucking him up more than I needed to so stop him).  Hardly traumatic, but that was the moment the group started to fall apart.  We always hung out at his place and this was no longer an option, so we hung out at different places, less and less.  80lb. psycho ended up moving to a different city, dunno what happened to him but I bet he's dead.

A couple years went by.  I rediscovered RC's and am still enjoying the exploration, but I am careful.  I do my homework, and I try not to skip any steps, but I still fucked up once and burned my apartment to bare black walls when I was on K one time, and very nearly died.  It can happen to anyone.  That experience deeply affected my friend who sold me the K, to the point where he quit dealing entirely, and was a bonding time for the both of us.  He's the one I put in the ground in May 2016.  I didn't feel anything about it at the time, just this awful toxic numbness.  Then more people started dying...friends, acquaintances, people I knew to see but didn't talk to much, all dropping like flies.  I wore out my black funeral shirt and had to go buy another one.  It was happening so fast and so often that the numbness just got deeper and more toxic.  I have terrible maladaptive coping mechanisms...I bottle for a long time, and when I can't do that anymore, drug bender to try and break down some of the walls I build to protect myself, so I can feel some of the feelings I am bottling and not dealing with.  But this is different, by the time I feel like I am ready to start that process, somebody else dies and it's like someone pulled the rug out from underneath me and I'm back where I started.  Everyone from that group I used to use with it either dead or moved now, mostly dead.

After today, after hearing about Johnny, I realize my bottle is so big now, trying to contain all that grief from that first death and stuff it down underneath the grief from the other deaths.  I can't take it anymore.  If I lose anyone else, that bottle's gonna burst, whether I like it or not, and it might just burst anyways, and I don't know how that's going to leave me.  I have no friends to talk to.  I can't trust professionals...even if I desperately want help, I'm too scared of their power to really tell them how I am feeling (except for one time, I did tell them honestly how I felt...they made me do a written test then told me my test results meant I was faking it all, and I've never been able to not lie to a professional since the one time I managed to do so ended up in being told to my face that I was lying).  I'd talk to my friends, but they're either dead or gone.  I don't know what I am going to do, but whatever it is, it scares me.",1516083250.0

My pain has become substantially worse and to top it off due to my last experiences with the emergency room i have not visited any doctors.

I will be visiting my doctor's assistant on friday , as my doctor does not have any appointments in the morning.


Im in the worst pain i have ever been in, in my entire life .


I know that Tramadol does not act on the same pathways and does work with suboxone (I have tried it myself)

I know that Tapentadol also uses similar pathways

(Tramadol can be used concurrently with suboxone)

But what else?

Is that it? lol


I have a feeling that they will most likely switch me to abuse-proof hydromorphone after i see 100 different doctors.


I have TMJ but its turning into a neuralgia in which i have pain throughout my head accompanied by vertigo/lightheadness, 
i have severe , crippling pain in my ear and often times my neck and other parts of my head are also bothering me.
The Jaw, and the ear, being the worst. But i also have radiating pain when i close my mouth.  i also have radiating pain through my shoulders.



tl;dr: What pain combination did you find best while you were in suboxone?
What pain combination did you find best AFTER YOU GOT OFF suboxone?




PS: ive been on Suboxone for 13 years. 9 years straight. im @ 4mg. i recently increased from 2mg due to the pain. Suboxone does not really treat my pain but its all i have besides codeine & dihydrocodeine .




So i hope that you understand my question as it is a bit hard to ask/explain in the proper wording
(i want to know what is the best opioids that can be used while on suboxone, and the best that you have found at relieving pain, after quitting suboxone. what opioid did you go to when you quit suboxone, to find adequate pain relief?)


Thanks for reading, 
and please no answers like ""ur guna relapse derka derka""
no, if i wanted to relapse i could have done that 10,000x
at this point of trying every pain medication and psychiatric medication on the market including 4 different muscle relaxers and 3 different NSAIDs that are burning ulcers in my stomach i could give a fuck less what people think about opiate and i hope that they legalize them.


It pisses me off that i am going to have to prostrate myself infront of doctors . im probably going to have to do it 20 times too",1516077912.0

I used Kratom as an alternative to other opiates. It seemed like a safe alternative, and a way I could stay 'in the shallow end.'


Well, I am addict, and it didn't work. I upped and upped my dosage until I was sick all the time - either from using too much, or not enough. My life became a nightmare. The withdrawal was 10x worse than it was from other opiate. The RLS was in-fucking-sane. I needed something else... I had come this far, and K was expensive, so getting back on the wagon seemed like the obvious choice.


I see people recommending kratom on this sub frequently, and it breaks my heart when I think of someone going through what I went through. Equally, I can totally understand that if it had 'worked' for me, I would want to spread the message. So, no hate to the people trying to spread the love.

Thanks! ☺️

See, the deal is...I took my methadone an hour before seeing him.  He doesn't know I'm a recovering h addict on maintenance methadone. 

apparently I live in the most dangerous and drug filled neighborhood in my city (when I heard this my jaw dropped because it's PRETTY DAMN NICE, last five years I lived in a shit hole midwestern city) he said they sell ""white heroin"" that all the girls on it are lesbian whores and that he thinks I let some dealer give me something. That when he saw me I looked FUCKED UP. 

I'm only on 40 mg of methadone and lemme tell ya folks shit will get you BLASTED. I was on like a gram and a half of h a day IV and 40 mg done makes me nod out. So I didn't wanna tell him this. I instead admit I'm bi polar, send him an article about my abilify and the extreme fatigue that's a side effect (all true) and promise him not to worry. 

On his birthday last week he paid for dinner paid for me to go to the club with him VIP. Paid for 2 bags of Coke for me paid for everything even my 1 euro metro ticket I was humiliated that I couldn't afford and it was HIS birthday. He constantly tell me to stop playing with the cocaine that me quitting would make him way happier and he wouldn't care about any financial losses. He's just...so sweet. 😭Maybe it's because we both have Muslim origins. It kinda creates a kinship. (I'm agnostic I just mean culture wise) 

I would never go back to that shit. I'm curious though white h wtf? Is that fent I thought we didn't have fent here in Spain. I also am kinda miffed he suggested would even THINK about selling myself and becoming one of these ""lesbian prostitutes"" (come on they can't all be lesbians what is he talking about lol)

whatever I sure hope he believed me 

long story short: my friend (dealer but friend first and foremost) thought I was on ""white heroin"" because I took my methadone an hour before seeing him and he was worried I was whoring myself out for heroin. I told him I was on my bi polar mess abilify (which I do take) ",1516071181.0

Let me go ahead and admit I had a lot of help.. I have been in jail the last 4 months. 
I was so committed to the drug that I let every single thing crumble around me. I constantly fucked people over that did nothing but love me. I lied and stole like my life depended on it. When all was said and done and I got arrested I was homeless and hitch hiking because the cops were showing up at my girlfriend and I's apt daily looking for me. 
I started with lortabs and worked my way up the pharmaceutical ladder at the age of 18 ending with shooting 10 8mg Dilaudids a day if I had the funds and worked my way over to heroin. The last year I was using I sunk so far into isolating myself that I gave up heroin and switched to opium tea. Using sometimes 3 pounds a day of seeds from the big 3. I did this because I didn't want to associate with people anymore. I could buy online and drown out the world. I had a beautiful girlfriend that was working 2 jobs and going to school. I idolized her and she was all the interaction I needed. But I too destroyed that with my self destructive behavior. 

I'm now 23 years old. I spent my 23rd birthday in jail. I went 4 months alone. No phone calls. No visits. No contact with the outside world. The first week I laid in my rack staring at the holes in the bottom of the bunk above me thinking of how I could loop my sheet through to asphyxiate myself without waking the guy above me up. I don't know what kept me from following through honestly. I was so broken. I spent the first full month in withdrawal due to tea's long half life. It took a month and a half to feel 90% again. I went three weeks without more than 45 minutes of sleep every other day. I am grateful for it all. I had to experience that. It broke me down to the base of my being and allowed me to rebuild myself. I cant begin to explain how much of a lost cause I was. I would have surely have died before I quit if I wasn't forced into that position. 

And now every day is a little bit better. I feel things again. I'm getting goose bumps as I type this because I can FEEL things again. I can smile because I want to now and not because I think thats what I should do for you. I can listen to what you have to say and actually care and be engaged. I feel happiness and joy and love and sadness and nervousness. All these I couldn't feel before because I went 5 straight years without detoxing back to homeostasis once. I'm free to let my mind explore this playground we call life and consciousness without the chains that opiates held me down with. I have been out a week tomorrow and have not considered once using.
I got out of jail a week ago and my girlfriend was there. I walked out of jail expecting to go walk to find a place to be homeless and she was right there waiting and my god people I cant explain how beautiful of a feeling it was wrapping my arms around her again.

I'm sharing this for those of you that feel hopeless. For those that take a shot hoping every time you might just not wake up. For those who have lost everything and still cant give it up. I felt the same exact way and I am here today to tell you that things CAN change. You can feel again and break the chains. I hope whatever force it takes to heal you finds you and your life becomes something you want to live again.

Much love. ",1516069133.0

**UPDATED WITH PIC! WTF IS THIS??**
It's supposed to be Oxy... and I've never done heroin- oxy is my DOC. Worried it's heroin/fent. There is weed mixed in with it cuz of a dirty surface.  Never seen oxy this color and am pretty certain it's not oxy. 

WARNING (this is long & annoying cuz I was in a hurry/ I'm sorry);

So I went on a dumb goose chase this afternoon with my old connect who isn't the brightest crayon in the box. He was just hooking me up with a few percs, then asked me to give him a ride to meet someone else for him to grab some xanax- he also mentioned the guy had an oxy 80 he was gonna buy and offered to split it w/me for giving him the extra ride. He called them purple and I know my oxy... never heard of a purple 80mg oxy. He said he rubs the coating off before he crushes them, so I imagined it was an OxyContin, not oxy IR. I tried to convince him to just cut it in half but he was insistent about crushing the whole pill and splitting it in half that way. And wanted me to do a line with him. I'm like, I guess- just thought he was lonely and I wanted oxy, so I agreed to it.... I never saw the pill cuz he put the drugs like down his pants- when we got to his house, he jumped out of the car to go get the lines ready while I parked- when I come in and see the lines,  it was like this off white color (almost yellow).. and I did just a tiny bit and scraped the rest into a pill container to bring with me- my heart started beating fast for like a minute & felt light-headed (never happens with oxy for me) and it smelled weird- but the drip in my throat tasted like oxy and it pretty much felt like it after the intense first minute or so,  
Do you think it's heroin? Never tried it before so I don't know.  And do you think he was trying to pretend that it was oxy, knowing it was heroin, just to get $40 off me? I was asking him about the imprint and he said it just said 80 on it and maybe something on the other side, but he has bad eyesight (he really does). Then he said it could have maybe been turquoise but he gets them from the guy when he can afford them. How the hell can you mistake purple for turquoise??

**Entry 34** - Friday, 11:00 PM
We almost made it to the exit into the courtyard when Ben’s weight caused the supports above the ceiling to break. We fell through in front of the courtyard door. When we looked out the door’s window we saw that it was not our building on fire, but the building we were headed to. 

The entire dining hall, kitchen, and office building was engulfed in flames. The fire was roaring, reaching over 20 ft high. The flames were too close and the heat too much to bear even one step into the courtyard. Chloe burned her hand pretty badly on the metal knob just trying to open the door. We really had no option but to turn back into the hallway and face the hoard of crazed junkies heading towards us. We could see them beginning to round the corner.

We just stood there, paralyzed. Burn to death or get eaten alive? That was the question.

Ben looked at me and told me to take care of Spooner. He told us we had to make a sprint for the intake office about halfway down the hallway. The horde had a head start and the fastest of them were already fairly close to the office. I knew there was no way we would make it in time. But when Ben began to sprint down the hallway, we followed. 

Ben and the hoard made it to the door at the same moment. But instead making a turn into the office, Ben powered forward at the oncoming mass of bodies. I watched in horror as he collided with the head of the hoard in an explosion of blood, flesh, and breaking bones. I felt the floor shake beneath me.

Chole made it into the office and I was able to help Spooner shuffle through. I put him on the couch and headed back into the hallway. But by then it was well too late. Ben had been able to push the oncoming mass of 30-40 bodies back by at least 15 feet, allowing us the time to enter the office. I stood there for a moment in the doorway. 

I don’t know what these things are but I do know that they are no longer human. They were ferocious in their focus on tearing Ben apart. My feet were cemented into the ground. I didn’t want to look but I couldn’t turn away. 

Overwhelmed with sensory input, everything was muted for a moment as my brain was trying to process what had just happened. I thought about my Mother. I thought about my dog. I thought about the house I grew up in. I thought about my first girlfriend and Christmas and spaghetti and baseball and my teacher from the 5th grade. I thought about the things I had wanted to do before I died. I realized Chloe was screaming at me. She yanked me back in the room and shut the door, and I fell to the ground.


**Entry 35** - Friday, 11:17 PM
The zombies are done with Ben now and back at the door. It sounds like it’s about to break. The fire appears to have hopped the courtyard and made it to our building. Thick black smoke is pouring in through the vents, and the wallpaper is beginning to melt off. Chloe cannot breathe. Spooner is going in and out of consciousness. The emergency lights have shut off.

I’ve put all the fentanyl stamps I found in Spooners pocket under my tongue. I took the rest of the Xanax that was left in the bottle from the nurse’s office. I just hope to God that I will OD before I burn to death. But really anything would be better than the way Ben went. 

In the unlikely event that someone reads all this, please tell my Mom that Chip says he is sorry and that he loves her very much. 

Signing off now, 

*Charles Winslow*

Ch. 1 - **Elle**

Elle’s gaze lingered on the shaky signature of Charles Winslow until a gust of wind and ash prompted her to finally peel her tired, bloodshot eyes from the final page. Scribbled amongst these burnt pages was a whirlwind story of the last days of a fellow survivor. She felt exhausted.

Elle took a step back, and surveyed the sunlit floor that was formerly an office within a drug rehab. She knew the fire had taken place several months ago, for she had witnessed it from the the apartment across the street. But it still felt fresh. Most of the building was gone, but the pain, fear, and terror seemed to linger. It made her feel uneasy. 

Elle consider stuffing the notebook back in the vent where she had found it, but stopped herself. She eyed the two corpses, and took a small comfort in the fact that they appeared to have died human. She wondered which one belonged to Chip.

Elle hadn’t realized it until stepping over the crumbled cinder blocks and out of the room but she had been reading for the last hour. She picked up her step a bit, knowing that Chen would be wondering where she was. She tried wiping her eyes dry but ended up getting more ash in them and making it worse.

“Agh! Shit! Fuck! ...Fuck!” Elle screamed in frustration as she threw the notebook on the ground, breaking the spine and scattering the pages all around her.

“Elle,” shouted a voice, unseen but close by. “Elle! What’s wrong? Elle!”

“I’m fine! I’m fine,” she shouted back. “Fucking perfect,” she muttered to herself.

“Well come over here then, I think I found it!”

Elle began to move towards Chen, but caught herself, stepped back, and bent over to pick up all the pages. She packed away the disorganized notebook in her satchel and looked up to the bright, cold winter sun. She stood still for a moment. She unfocused her eyes and stared at nothing. And after her daily existential crisis was complete, she took a deep breath and continued moving toward the sounds of Chen repeatedly slamming his hatchet.

It certainly wasn’t the first time Elle’s heart has felt torn apart since the beginning of the outbreak four months ago. It was obvious that she had been building an emotional callus, but this one stung through.

The wind was blowing ever so slightly, enough to blow up the ashes into beautiful swirling displays. Elle zipped up her dirty puffy jacket all the way to keep out the chill. When she arrived at the spot where she left Chen was she looked around but couldn’t see him anywhere. It was precisely the spot where he agreed to stay. She felt a pang of anxiety pop up again.

“Hey. Down here.” 

Elle jumped back, startled. A slim shadow moved below her. She would not have seen him but for the whites of his eyes. He was several feet below ground level in what appeared to be the basement of the other burned down building. He was caked in black ash, covered from head to toe. He was camouflaged flawlessly with the blackened interior of the room.

“Jesus man, you scared the shit out of me,"" proclaimed Elle.

“Oh yeah, ha, sorry about that. But look here, I think I found it.” Chen said as he began to wail on a dented lockbox with the antique hatchet he had found in an empty apartment on the 5th floor.

Elle stood there with her hands on her hips. “And what fool’s errand are we out here for again?”

Chen paused and looked at Elle inquisitively, head cocked to the side. “For the key. The… key...for the exchange. The needle exchange that Jules said we need to get to.” Chen was never one to question authority. He was undoubtedly dense, which was sometimes annoying but also made him ruefully charming.

Elle rolled her eyes. “It was rhetori-- nevermind. Ya, so did you find it?”

“Well, there are definitely keys in here, I can hear them when I shake it, but I just hope they’re the right ones.” 

Chen let out what he probably imagined to be a fierce warrior’s cry and broke the hinge off the lockbox with a final blow. He proudly looked over to Elle, with a small smirk.

“Alright grab them and lets get the Fuck outta here,” Elle said as she motioned him to hurry. “They are close by, I can feel it. And this sunlight won’t last forever, clouds are approaching,” Elle stated as she pointed to the sky.

Chen stuffed the ring of keys into his pocket and climbed up the side of the basement, reaching out to grab Elle’s hand as she helped pull him up.

“You look like a goddamn chimney sweeper,” Elle joked as Chen stood up beside her.

“Damn right. I look badass,” he responded. 

Elle couldn’t help but smile as she wiped ash from his face with the cuff of her jacket. She grabbed Chen’s water bottle and backpack from the ground handed it to him. 

“Come on, let’s get back to the tower,” Elle began with a tired sigh, “Jules will be wondering where we are. And if these *are* the keys we need, we’ll be headed out tomorrow at first light. And as stupid as that plan is, you know as well as I do that breaking into the needle exchange is Jules’ top priority.”

Chen nodded and they began their short march towards the apartment complex across the street. Without looking, Elle reached in and felt the notebook, ensuring herself it was still there.

They crossed the cement path that surrounded the property and came up on the pointed iron fence. Fortunately, there was a spot where a enormous diesel truck had crashed into the fence, creating an opening. This is where they had been entering and exiting when they came to scavenge here.

Chen was whistling to himself while his was climbing over the roof of the red pickup when a large shadow moved over them. As soon as she realized what was happening, Elle looked up to the sky in horror. She saw that the clouds had been moving much faster than expected. 

Knowing they had both gravely misjudged the situation, Chen’s demeanor turned deathly serious as he reached out his hand to pull Elle up on the truck. He locked his eyes with hers and croaked, “Hurry. They’re coming.”

In the meantime I've been taking Vicodin to quell the pain which works nicely, I take a fiber pill every time I take one but still find defecating to be difficult. Oddly enough the issue in my anal region doesn't affect my pooping and is only painful when I constrict the muscles such as when squeezing out a turd or the last drops of pee. 

My tactic while defecating is basically to let it freely come out on its own and only pushing rather than constricting the muscles like I mentioned above. When I do this however the poop basically has to freefall and I'm left wondering if I finished or not. What happens to any remaining fecal matter than you don't forcefully push out at the end?

7qmxs7,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7qmxs7/ever_get_really_itchy_around_the_eyes_ways_to/,19,https://redd.it/7qmxs7,sloan_fitch,Ever get really itchy around the eyes? + ways to treat it.,"A few months back I was hanging out with this chick I know who get's laid with men as much as I wish I got laid with women. We ended up driving around with who I presume was her fuck buddy for that week and I noticed that he had bags under his eyes that looked irritated and shit. Didn't think too much into it but I did suspect that he may have been doing H as well on his own time.



A couple of times I've had batches of dope that made the skin around eyes really itchy. It doesn't help that I engage cycling during the winter which can result in damaged dry skin but that on it's own isn't bad especially if you have lotion and wear appropriate protection such as a hat, mask and goggles. Really recently I had this happen and when I took steps to address it with lotion it got way worse, the fucking skin under my eyes got red and even swollen for a day. It was fucking crazy, I looked like shit.


&nbsp;

So a couple of times the skin around my eyes got really itchy, I rubbed it a lot and then tried putting vaseline on below the eyes and it didn't help as much as I hoped. I thought vaseline was a good all around fixer upper but in this case it was useless. Specifically the dry skin was causing me to get really well defined lines below my eyes and the Vaseline wasn't helping. Though it didn't seem to do any harm biologically. 


Then if you have dry and damaged skin and you put lotion it, it stings. If it stings you want to wash that lotion off right away because you'll just end up making that skin red, possibly swollen and will likely inhibit healing. 

&nbsp;

If petroleum jelly doesn't help and lotion doesn't, what does? Well apparently **vitamin A and D ointment.** Some times you'll end up with a crust after apply the ointment before bed but it's easy to rinse off. Which reminds me, I think before bed time is the best time to apply the ointment. You can use more generous amounts without worry about being too reflective in public. 

&nbsp;


Once I put lotion on really irritated skin and it got more irritated. To the point where the skin appeared chemically burned on my upper cheek and below my eyes. The vitamin A and D ointment helped resolve this and I didn't notice any negative effects. 

Only once the skin is healed can you apply more conventional moisturizing lotions. 

&nbsp;

Bottom line, if your dope makes you itchy around the eyes don't rub it the shit out of it. Once the skin is damaged from rubbing it too much, don't put any irritants on such as lotion. So far the A and D ointment seems to be the safest effective thing I've used.",1516050930.0

See my brother had one when he was 7 (I was 6), and it did not look like fun (to say the least). I'm also really scared of anesthesia (and I never had one).

But now? I'm still scared of anesthesia, but I also really fucking hope I'll get appendicitis someday, preferably soon. Just the thought of going into the ER with intense pain has me salivating. Why? well, because once the doctors run their tests and conclude I have appendicitis, I'll have to wait a few hours for my stomach to clear before they'll operate on me. Awesome hours those would be, as I'll be getting routine morphine shots while I wait.

And after the operation? Oh boy. That's when I'll get a constant morphine drip (likely one I can control with a button) as my body heals and the post operative pains fade. That shit sounds like fucking heaven let me tell you. 

I'm not aiming too high, my fantasy isn't unrealistic (like winning the lottery). It's actually quite a humble fantasy. And yeah, I know it's fucked up. Story of life.

Couples can't get clean together. It's doomed to fail. Et cetera. And maybe I'm coming around to it. I've been shooting heroin on and off for a few years now with a few rounds of getting clean short term.

Even though I'm pretty set on cleaning up I'm really only doing it because I'm telling myself I'll come back to it when my financial shit is straight after several months, or a few years, or something. I'm just trying not to think about long term too much cause it's only day 6 cold turkey and it's still a crazy mental game. I had 4 days to lay around and kick, struggled through a long ass shift through frozen conditions and came home from that hell exhausted and just defeated. Coming home to her telling me everything I want to hear about picking up.

Thank god for the cold front that rolled through. She was trying to pick up but no one was gonna deal with the weather. I'm sure if she did pickup I'd be back to banging. Right now she's begging for me to go because she's too sick to drive, but I'm just not having it even though the money is there. She can't kick with subs. The new promise is she'll get straight at rehab but she doesn't have insurance and definitely can't afford it so I don't think that's even an option. There's always an excuse for why now is not the time when we're in withdrawal, but when we're rounding off our last shot we talk about being pretty committed.

It's not all her fault. There's been times I caused a relapse. I think we were 5 weeks clean when I woke up from a drug dream all wound up and just wordlessly left to get everything we need.

I'm sticking with it, I think. It's really hard when you're hearing heroin beg for you to come back through a person you love and hate to see suffer. But I gotta be strong. For both of us. For now.

Were they going to call anyone and let them know?  Nope! They posted a notice there so why bother calling all the patients.  Here's why:. Most people would have reasonably assumed they'd be closed today due to weather AND they didn't answer the phone for me or anyone else.  Only reason I knew they were open was because someone left a Google review about it.

Clinics do give subs to quite a few people, but its estimated that almost 9/10 off them goes into streets.


Is it the lack of H that has made Subs so addictive to my fellow countrymen? Or is it jsut really that addictive?

They'd say ""I'll get you that bun I owe you on Monday"" and I'd say to myself, ""great, I don't need my last $40 for subs."" Perhaps I'd end up putting that money towards dope as the situation got more and more desperate.


Then Monday would roll around and I would continually send anticipatory texts for status updates. Like that time back in June when I got a text response that said, ""it's going down now"", but in reality it took three more hours to find out it didn't pan out.

&nbsp;

I would've been fucking sick if I didn't prepare for adverse scenarios. On Sunday I spoke to Cliff to see what he wanted from my life after persistently texting me for hours and the day prior. 

Basically he told me he'd get me the bun he owed me the following day and that he needed to borrow $20 for a cab to go to his roxy appointment next week.

&nbsp;

In our conversation I said, ""I might be able to get a sub tomorrow"" and he said ""that would be big."" 

I don't see why that would be the case, if he's so confident about re-upping on dope the next day anyway. So I didn't tell him I had already obtained four subs. If I shared, I'd regret it at a later time since he certainly isn't likely to succeed in helping me replenish my supply of subs.


As expected, of the two times I checked on Monday, it didn't pan out for him. On Tuesday I checked again early in the day and he said ""waiting on..."" I inquire, ""waiting on the dboy to deliver or waiting on confirmation?"" He confirms, that he's waiting on confirmation. A couple of hours later I go ""so no chance we'll have this before 10AM tomorrow?"" He responds, ""I'm working on it now, I'll kyp.""

Follow-up indicates he's waiting on a reply. My next follow-up indicates he's still waiting on a reply. So in other words, since noon ""waiting on confirmation"" to midnight ""waiting on reply"", it's clear nothing has changed. Maybe he doesn't really have money for two buns like he said?

&nbsp;


Bottom line, I'm just really happy that I fucking take better care of myself and now. I used to hate the shit I'd put myself through because I counted on an unreliable person's word. You know, all I want is to have some fun, enjoy my dope or whatever and then not get sick. 

From there, plot the next step. Execution is the hard part lol

If I do a better job of not wasting my money next week (having subs already will help) after pay day, then I'll be in position to do something to further improve. Photo ID, medical insurance then sub doc. Alternatively, I'll get photo ID, and then see sub doc. Both scenarios require me to have money for the DMV filing fee.

I’m not really sure how this question/thought came to me, but my brain is a pretty bonkers place, so it’s best not to go poking around in there. Hahaha. Anyway, I was just curious as to what movie/television drug tropes bother you the most? (For anyone who isn’t clear on what a trope is, it’s basically a common convention or device used in, pretty much, any form of media. The definition is kinda blah, but they’re much easier to understand after you see one or two. And most people around these parts probably already know what a trope is anyway. Sooo... yeah. Hahaha.)

Personally, one of the most annoying drug tropes for me has to be the whole... “Yeah man, I’m a 100% straight dude, but I’ve sucked dick before to get my drugs!” Now, I’m not saying that this has never happened in real life before, because I’m sure it has! However, TV shows and movies make it seem like, if you’re short on cash, then most dealers will let you suck ‘em off as a trade, no matter who you are... male, female, gay, straight, bi, etc. Which, to me, is a pretty big pile of bullshit. Haha. 

The main reason I take so much issue with this is because, as a gay dude who’s biggest sexual kink is an obsession with giving straight guys head, I have NEVER been given the option to swallow a load in exchange for a bun. Because, believe you-me, I would’ve signed up for that right then and there. Haha. (I’ve never gone through an unattractive d-boy, which would definitely make my eagerness a different story. Hahaha.) To be completely honest, if I had the option, I would FOR SURE be blowing d-boys non-stop. It’s a win/win situation for me no matter how you look at it!!! (Also, I swear I’m not a total slut. I just love dishin’ out BJs.) Basically the issue I take with this particular trope is that I’m jealous of these lucky motherfuckers. Hahahahaha. For real though!!

This is my first post, but I have read this sub for quite some time.

Anyway, for my first post I come with a question. I am an experienced user with a multi year habit from which I got clean for several months before recently relapsing. The H I got started on always had a strong vinegar smell, which I always associated with quality and strength because it was in fact fire (I know smell isn't a sure indicator of quality). That was on the west coast and, while i cant say for sure, the effects of the dope felt like actual H, not fent. However, the stuff I recently got had practically no smell (I've since moved to a different state and cold copped it). It was strong stuff (brown powder), but then again my tolerance still isn't what it used to be as I'm not yet balls deep back into my habit. The legs were about 6-8 hours. It was pretty sedative. I'm wondering if maybe it was fent laced? Who else gets dope that doesn't smell that is actual H and is solid stuff? Thanks for the input. ",1516134632.0

I literally think this is the coolest thing ever to be thought of and when it comes out it will save so many of us from death via fent pills.

Got a couple questions if anyone feels like helping me out.,"A couple days ago I made a post about getting clean due to necessity and lack of money. Unfortunately, I failed miserably, and pretty much only succeeded in terrorizing my body for several hours before scraping together the last of my money for enough dope to keep me well so long as I dose myself every 12 hours or so for the next day or two, something I'm capable of doing, but the looming threat of withdrawal is rearing its head again, and Im not really sure what to do. 

I really do want to get clean, but goddamn, that attempt was agony. Im not entirely sure if took my subs too soon and brought about the onset of precipitated WD or what, but good lord... I was tossing and turning and literally crying out in pain while the minutes crawled by like hours. 

It felt like the subs did absolutely nothing, so I don't know if they were expired? When I put them under my tongue, they dissolved, but they dissolved into a mouthful of brackish, grey sludge that I ended up spitting out after I did some research (holding the horrible crud in my mouth for like a half hour while I googled stuff), and it seemed that everyone who experienced this swallowed the spit and experienced horrible headaches and diarrhea... The thing is, Im still not sure if what I experienced was precipitated WD, or just regular WD and the subs did nothing because they were either expired, I took too little (I too about 4 mg to start out with, waited 3 hours took another 4, waiting another 3 hours and nothing at all happened except my WDs got worse). 

Does regular WD usually get to a point where you're crying in pain and tossing and turning in literal body agony? I've been fairly far along into regular WD maybe once or twice, but never gotten to that point, so Im not sure if what I was experiencing was regular WD or precipitated WD due to taking the subs too early (though, by all accounts, I had scored at least a 9 on the scale you're supposed to use in order to determine when you should dose subs). 

Anyway, this sucks... I have bills coming up in a week or two and some back rent that needs paying (thankfully not due to me using house funds for dope, but because some people who rent from me screwed me over with rent and bill money to the tune of several thousand dollars...) Unfortunately, that whole scenario puts me in a precarious position. I signed up for health care (medicaid) because I qualify, and I plan to go to a clinic to get some assistance with kicking, but until then, Im pretty sure Im just going to keep my current regiment (so long as I can afford it... Im selling some stuff I don't need, and hopefully it moves soon... anyone need a laptop or some music gear?)

At the very least, if I get into an emergency situation where I'm forced to WD, I have about 4 doses of Kratom, a half a valium, access to flexeril and gabapentin, a decent amount of loperamide (a bottle of immodium and a bottle of loperamide pills), and maybe 8 mg's of those subs that didn't seem to work (still not sure what's up with that saliva buildup... seems to happen to some people and not others.) I guess I could *try* to get by with the kratom first? I dunno... last time I tried that it didn't work either. It seems like my WDs are resistant to attenuation, which is kinda scary, not to mention that even when sober, benzos don't seem to do much for me unless I take a bunch and then I just black out for days, and I definitely don't have *that* much benzo, I don't think.

Anyway, thanks for (potentially) listening to my all too common plight and the support you guys have been unfailingly giving myself and others who need it. This subreddit is something of a godsend for discussing shit like this.

God I’m really just so disappoint in myself.

It just really sucks to have to experience. I swear I have never had anyone else accuse me of some of the things she accused me of.

I have a using buddy who had an ex w bpd, super similar situation, it sucks how right he’s been about things. So predictable.

I can’t help but assume she hates me. She did this over text message. After 9 months of living together and about a month of not. The day after I finally get stable on subs. What the fuck.

Afterward we exchange numbers with the pill man and now have scripts of these white 30mg and green 15mg oxy’s twice a month. (About 50 each we split with each other)  Sometimes we do have to pay, but mostly he’s more than happy with the weed. Only gripe about the guy is how much he talks about the most mundane shit - “Oh, my new bicycle seat is authentic leather” “Would you guys tell me what shade you think this paneling is?” and we have to sit through it for 2 hours before leaving. 

Anyway we always break her down as much as she wants too and she’s happy she doesn’t have to middle or pay for the THC to trade anymore. 

What’s your story of how you met the dude? ",1516252520.0

I see so many people complaining about not being able to cop for days or cant get ahold of their guy etc. Ive never had that problem.

So today while waiting for my DGirl to hit me back, I decided to grab a couple shots and some bars from my bro to hold me over. He had a good deal on the bars and he said they were dank ( pressed hulks ).

I meet up with him, I grabbed 9 and a shot of black for my girlfriend and I. We did our shots then each took A QUARTER. As it starts to kick in, I'm pleasantly surprised at how good they are. Naturally I decide to start cleaning out my vehicle in the parking lot. No big deal. I got all the trash picked out of the truck and put into a shopping bag. I then walked across the parking lot, behind a store and threw my trash bag away.

I get back to the vehicle and my wonderful girlfriend is chasing my two dogs around the parking lot, screaming their names. Doors open, people everywhere. This is a strip mall parking lot. There's probably two dozen stores, there was a lot of people. 

Ok, so I get in and drive to where she is. Our dogs jumped into someone else's car, we got the dogs out and got the fuck out of there. At this point I thought I better go buy narcan. Im not sure why, I wasn't in the danger zone. Regardless, we drive to my pharmacy. 

I go in, wait about 30 minutes, get called up, request narcan and they tell me that I need to go through a training thing and it may take 15 minutes. I'm like "" ok no big deal, should I just stick around or will it be a while until you're ready?"" They tell me take a seat as it won't be very long until they're ready to start the training thing. I wait 20 minutes, ask them what's up and they say that It should be ready in about 20 more minutes. Jesus Christ ok. I walk back out to the racecar. 

We started arguing violently. Not physical but shit was rough. We both xanax raged out now. I walk back in the hospital, still not ready, fuckit ok I'm going to take a other quarter and get stoned while I wait. I load the bowl when I get back, take a big ol rip, pass it to her, "" hey babe where's those bars at?"" "" I DONT KNOW. IVE NEVER SEEN THEM!""  I start looking around and can't find them. She's screaming... The trash bag..

I figured I just have thrown them away with my fuckin garbage hours prior. I drive back across town, fighting away with honey boo bear, and finally after what seems like an eternity in afternoon traffic I arrive. She glares and lights a cigarette as I get out to investigate. "" Fuckin dumbass,""..  I park in the exact same spot and re trace my steps to the dumpster. 

There's a fresh layer of garbage bags on top of my little Walgreens bag but it's there. I climb out of the dumpster and tare apart the little bag and HOT DAMN THERE THEY ARE! lucky me.. I get back, she's less than amused I found them but she's glad I didn't just throw away money. 

We drive back to the pharm, bickering and fighting the whole time. She gets her shit and acts like she's going to get out at the light. I wasn't stopping her. She changed her mind. The light turns green and we are off, a couplea kids in love. We get to the pharmacy and I light my cigarette, toss her the lighter along with her debit card that I had in my wallet. "" Think about your decision real hard and lock the doors if you leave."" . 

Right when I get inside our plug hits me ( and I'm assuming her) up saying she's ready. I look outside and it's raining now. I know I have a partner in crime for at least one more day. 20 minutes later I'm walking back out with two nasal sprays of sober juice. She's in the back yelling at the dogs, hospital security parked closely behind watching. I tell her to get the fuck in front and let's bounce. I wave at the dude and proceed.    

We go pick up and all is good on the home front. Not another peep. We are getting ready for a nice dinner and some shottys. Another day in the life if a dysfunctional junky relationship.

Today tho.........today is different. I always think about hopping on the post pictures of gorgeous dope and drug ig. However, it took the WORST day I've had literally in years to actually pull the trigger on a post.

Little background I've been using for a long time and IV for several months now. I (for the most part) no what I'm doing. I live in a rural area just meaning no corner boys or different blocks to cop from, u just go to whoevers spot and well u know the drill.

With that out of the way let's get to my extremely fucked up day. I was lower than usual last night meaning I was not doing great this morning, ok, but not great. I get a call from a buddy in need (I middle man) which made me happy because it gave me what I need to grab.

My guy tells me he only has a little left until later today. So I tell him to hold that I'm omw and I'll be back later he says cool, up to this point normal day, business as usual.  So I have my buddy come get me and I take off to my dudes house and he stops answering. He finally responds and says come in 30 (normally pretty true to his timing). 30 mins rolls around I hit him up and he says come at 410 roughly another 25 mins after the original 30. I'm getting very sick at this point. 410 comes around and ...nothing. 

I finally hear from him at idk well after 5 and he tells me to come through. I get there and he grabs the shit goes to weigh it and his gf shows up. Dude argues with his gf a good 20 mins with me sitting tbere. She then leaves and I'm like cool. Well, now she fucking calls so I wait and wait wait. Hangs up on her comes in the kitchen with me and another dude shows up. This mother fucker serves him first and this starts texting back and forth with his gf until finally getting to me and sending me omw. This entire process was at lleast another hour from when I got there. 

So obviously I frantically rush home to get well bust the shit open and throw it in the soon start mixing it with the plunger on one only two very shitty rigs. During this process the tip of the plunger breaks in half. Well at least I have another rig. Pull it up Can. Not. Hit. To save my life because the rig is so bad. I leave to go to another friends to try and get another one and as I'm trying to swap from one to the other I spill at solid .25 shot almsot completely and then continue to not be able to hit. While I'm there I give her some of my stuff and head home to find a different one to try.

I get home and since I gave that chick some of my shit I let her keep the bag (my stuff is in chunks so it's not all powder and shit) so it's just sitting on my lap. Yup u guessed it. Hopped out in such a hurry to get well I forget it's on my lap and it goes into the snow .. I salvage what I can and quickly get it in a spoon. Finally, FINALLY I get what's left to hit. I got probably a point out of the half g I waited all day dope sick to buy.... FML",1516235854.0

When he got over that he stood up, bug eyed and just started screaming like he was terrified. Dude fell over his table in his panic. We got him back on his bed and his girl was asking him whats his name and what's her name but he just kept saying, ""Aliens, did you see the aliens?"" While grabbing at her legs to the point she had to get away cause he was hurting her.

I felt bad, but after that I told her I had to dip and that I thought she should take him to the ER as she thought it was happening  because he was sick and that he hasn't taken any drugs.

I don't know if he's trying to get clean and this is a result of w/ds, since the dude eats like 25 3+ mg pressed bars a day and just got into snorting fent.

So, I've been on Oxy for about a year now and I have absolutely no libido. I'm not ever in the mood. My wife doesn't know about my addiction, and its not much. About 30mg a day.. and when I do have sex, I can get it up but I just never feel like i'm in the mood, and we do end up fucking for HOURS because I cant finish.. which also isn't exactly a bad thing. 

I started taking Testosterone supplements and that seems to have helped a bit, my question is it safe to take a ""go go pill"" like you find at 711 and the gas station.. I had some of those a few years ago and basically she has to touch me and i'm up and ready to go. Have never tried it on opiates though. 

Its starting to become a problem and I don't seem to have the self control to taper off and put it down. I wake up and start thinking how am I going to get through the day without taking these shitty pills.

my questions are

A) how messed up am I going to get, should I throw the box away like they said I should and sneak a few pills to try when I try back to my home?

B) what sort of effect should I be expecting? Am I going to be nodding and shit or is codeine way milder than that?

C) can I mix it with weed? Should I just wait till I get back home so I can smoke and take the pill?

D) just avoid the whole thing and let the opiate experience remain a mystery? 

Edit: my cousin may have had either legitimate medical issues or an addiction problem Boone’s being clear but thats prolly where the pills came from

Was wondering if any of you had any recommendations/tips to the method I have come up with.,"I have been using opiates for nearly a decade, mostly heroin. This most recent run has been going for about 3 years. I am tired and I want to be done (or realistically a break). I, like many of you, just can't deal with the withdrawals. Subs and methadone are not an option for me right now, so I figure tapering is the best option. 



Heroin is obviously going to be difficult to dose and measure accurately. Thankfully, my source is extremely consistent so I have a pretty good feel for it. Originally IV was my prefered route of administeration. Over the last two weeks I have completely made the switch over to snorting it. My plan was to essentially stop using and once I start to feel withdrawal symptoms take just enough dope to make the withdrawals subside. Rinse and repeat over and over, using less and less dope each time.




Ultimately will power will be the key to success here. I think I am ready and I believe I can do it. I'd like to get my hands on some benzos, though I haven't had much luck finding any. I have a gram of solid dope to do this with (though like I mentioned I have pretty easy access to the stuff). 





Does anyone have any recomendations or tips or similar experiences to share? Any insight would be greatly appreciated.",1516229007.0

At first look I thought she was taking a nap since her plates were out of state she was parked.  I ended up walking my dog later and noticed nearly 1.5 hours later she was sitting in the exact same position.  I got very concerned and realized this person might have been using or potentially is just very tired.  I weighed the options of either checking on her myself or simply calling the police (she was parked in a non-public lot).  I didn't know what was going on but wanted to make sure she was safe.  I chose to knock on her window and she woke up and was clearly on something (based on my best guess it was an opiate of some kind maybe heroin) anyway...I explained to her she had been out for at least 2 hours and she was in shock.  She refused help or assistance and clearly wasn't there for any reason.  I went to get my dog to walk and within minutes she had taken off (probably concerned I'd be calling the police).  Anyway after I began to wonder if I did her a disservice by not calling the police.  Was she safe to drive at that point?  Would it have helped her get help?  Did she drive off thinking this was a close call but going to use again?  So my question to you as people who use...would you have rather someone call it in and maybe give you a better chance of taking care of yourself?  I didn't want to get anyone in trouble but I hate to think how I may have just let her go to learn the lesson another day and maybe next time she won't be so lucky or maybe someone will rob her/steal her car.  (keys were in it and it was running the whole time).  What do you want a bystander to do in this situation?  I will say the girl was very appreciative of me checking on her and making sure she was ok but was emphatic to not get additional help or assistance.  My guess is she still had drugs on her or who knows.  Just want to help in the best way I can.  I live in an area that is a major metro area that has a problem so seeing syringes on the ground isn't unheard of and I want to know what the best choice is the next time I come upon this situation.,1516228492.0

It's something I think about from time to time but thought I should let you know.,"About 3-4 years ago I was in and out of hospital with kidney trouble. In one week I had to go to A&E twice, both times leaving with a prescription for oxynorm 20mg. Shortly after I had surgery and was again prescribed oxnorm. 

Because I had taken so many opiates in and out of hospital in the preceding months the prescribed dose didn't adequately manage the pain I was in.

No problem, they didn't know that, I thought. I'll just take a little more until I'm no longer in pain. After only 2 days I was doubling my dose, a privilege I could afford due to having been written multiple scripts in such a short space of time. On the third day I decided fuck it, I've been through a lot. I might take 3 instead of 2 and just chill out and enjoy myself for a few days. Nothing major, just a little buzz. I've been through a lot. I deserve it. I'm not banging heroin, just and extra tablet recreationally and semi-medicinally.

Despite the obvious naivety of the above mindset, drug addiction and mental illness had always fascinated me ever since I was a small boy and listened to Dosed and The Zephyr Song on the RHCP's album, By the Way. I had seen every documentary; Black Tar Heroin, Cocaine Cowboys, The Town Addicted to Meth, Ben, High on Crack Street, Teenage Heroin Epidemic, dozens of episodes of Intervention etc. etc. 

This is how terrifyingly insidious opiates are. Despite all of this, I still thought I could just play with them for a bit, that the fact i was in a post op surgery bed meant that the rules didn't apply.

I was worried about dosage and withdrawals and wanted to know if 60mg would be dangerous. I was met with person after person telling me to fucking run and stop what I was doing immediately. Here's where the insidiousness of opiates reared it's head yet again; I was genuinely annoyed at you all for telling me. I wanted to be validated, 60mg for a few days/weeks will be fine just don't go any higher. A little buzz isn't the end of the world. 

Then what can only be described as a massive turning point in my life happened. I thought, these people know what they are talking about. Don't listen to opiates, they're cunts and lie to you. You know this and have heard people weeping through withdrawals on YouTube saying the same. 

These people are trying to help. Listen to them.

It was about 3am when I made the post. At 3:15 I collected all the blister packets of oxynorm from my bedside table, walked across the hall, knocked on my parents door and handed them to my mum as she wiped sleep from her eye. I instructed her to never, under any circumstances, give me more than the prescribed dose regardless of how much pain I was in or how I rationalised it to her. I then told her to flush the rest when I was healed. She did and I have only had opiates once since, while in hospital.

From time to time I think about that night. I have an EXTREMELY addictive personality. I had serious trouble regulating video games. Opitaes would have won the battle, easily. 

Thank you all so much for being honest with me that night. Were it not for this sub telling me not to I feel I could have very easily justified the third tablet to myself that night and I shudder to think where my life would have gone from there. 

I am in my second year of medical school and have a fulfilling social life and am relatively healthy.

I'm sorry for all of you who are suffering, but thank you all for stopping me going down the same road. I wish you all the best.",1516226309.0

I've been orally consuming very low doses of opiates daily for the past year (due to the rules of this sub I can't be more specific on which ones). Since I've been doing this, I've had no periods to speak of, despite maintaining a normal weight. I have also had ovarian cysts my whole life, and was told as a teen that I would likely always have a hard time getting pregnant, which (until now) had proven true. I'm 30 now and suddenly just found out that I'm pregnant.

I'm not too thrilled and don't plan on keeping it. Since I have had no periods, I also have no idea how far along I am, which is extremely worrisome to me. I imagine I can't be too far in, as I'm fairly petite and not really showing at all yet, and (weirdly) I have no symptoms at all, save for a little heartburn.

I'm wondering if anyone else has had this experience. Could my daily dose of opiates be masking pregnancy symptoms? And did any women here lose their periods when consuming regularly?

A few months ago i was in a pretty dark place and was spiraling out of control. I started using heroin in early october because i just didn’t care what happened to me. I made a post on here before i tried it the first time and EVERYONE told me how bad an idea this was but i didn’t care i did it and fell in love with it. About 2 months down the line i was reading a lot of posts about people getting clean and others sharing what heroin has taken from them and i decided that i wouldn’t let myself go down this road. Been clean since November 24th and i want to say thank you to everyone on this sub for being the most unbiased, informative and caring people on this site. I feel great now and haven’t done any drugs other than some weed here and there for the past few months and i’m beginning to appreciate sobriety for what it is.

Quick background, I have been prescribed 120-5mg oxys a month along with 20XR adderall and 1MG xanax for the past 3 years or so. I do not ""abuse"" the adderall or xanax at all, those scripts are taken as the bottle says and last me the whole month. The 120 oxys used to last me 20 days, then it was 12-14 days and now its about 8 days. I usually get my script and crush 6 immediately and Im pretty buzzed up feeling good so Im assuming 30mg oxys are my current ""high"" threshold. I just managed to get a gram #4 H and tested it with a test strip because im scared of the fent stories I hear where most H is cut with it and people are rapidly ODing. Well turns out this bag I got has no traces of fent in it, so maybe im pretty lucky here. I would like to do how ever much is close to a 20-30mg oxy high. I dont wanna do too much of this stuff, so advice is appreciated! I just started out my morning by having 2 5mg percocet and 2 cranberry vodkas as I always drink on opiates for a better buzz..This bag is just sitting in front of me and im alone so should I just line up a line as if it were a regular oxy with no tylenol in them or is that too fat of a line still?

If your abusing the shit out of it and take like 30G+ a day, then 1 your a fucking idiot, and 2 no shit your gonna feel pretty awful coming off. Thats an INSANE amount. People will jump from H to massive doses of kratom and barely have any WD from the H, then when they quit the kratom they have awful wd. What did you think was gonna happen? Your taking enough to stave off fucking Heroin withdrawal. 

Use this plant responsibly, you shouldnt be taking doses any higher than like 3.5g per dose and a max of 7g daily. The more kratom you take, the more antagonists you build up. Lower doses are MORE effective over time, and have far far far less side effects.

Just stop putting a bad name on this plant because your abusing it and taking enough that would hold off heroin wd’s. If your getting off a real opi, you need to taper after the first 3 days, tapering down to a reasonable level. Your tolerance goes down, and the effects increase. Its a win win. ",1516370188.0

(Sorry, Just ranting)","Just wanted to rant  cause upset at the moment. Sorry it's kind of long. Nothing special here, so dont have to read this but feel free. So over the past months to past year, I have dropped so much money for dope given to my dealer.  The past week alone, I used my own money and middled for 2 people, and spent a little under a grand. Before that, the habit was average 125 daily. (Worked a decent job a solid year before dabblin back into H, so had an okay amount of money in my savings).  

Anyways, when I was running low on money, my dealer was always like yeah Man I'll always take care of you if you come to me. Around Christmas time, I told him I was running low on funds and might have to hop off soon and quit. He said don't worry he'll take care of me, hit him up and he'll help me out. He said he needed rides daily and he'd throw me some tar for a ride or his exact words, ""Catch me in a good mood and i'll throw you something. No need to wait until you're sick', just hit me up"". With all the money I've spent, today I was really hurting so I hit him up. I asked him if he needed a ride anywhere, or will trade a tiny bit for suboxone (Only had 2 or 3, I can actually sell these for cash but the guy who wants them is sleeping) and he asked if i had anything else. I told him I had a weight set, GPS, Nintendo64 + 8 games, and Beats headphones ($280 brand new, it was opened but in mint condition still in box and rarely ever used, (don't listen to music anywhere besides in the car)). Anyways, he doesn't respond at all to any of those items. 

I know it's pointless and I shouldn't expect anything, but i told him I was really hurting to the point I would of sunk to a new low, and he couldn't even give me a dub let a lone a dime for all my stuff. (I posted something on Craiglist and had some interest but obviously some things take time to set up and I needed something tonight).  If he didn't want any of my stuff, could of let him hold onto it as collateral or he could of just said no but just ignores me. He did this last week too when I offered to trade an Ipad, then 2 hours later when I got money and texted him, he immediately responds and tells me to come. Really pisses me off how much money I've spent and all the shit he's talked about helping, but this 1 and only time I've asked for help, he denies it. And I've never ever asked for a front before. Everytime i've tried to come with some amount of money, or trade items of value or offer to buy something for him with a Credit card, but this time i couldn't. 

Again, sorry for the rant, i'm just pissed. How nice are your dealers? Would they front you, or help you out in anyway? Wish I could just drop him completely. I don't want to give him my business anymore... it's just you all know how withdrawals are, I don't want to go back but am scared if I get really sick I'll cave back in. Someone did offer to buy the subs tom, so I am not completely out of luck, I'm just still pissed, and more so dissapointed. 

Sorry for the rant, again I know he owes me nothing, no one here owes me anything, just wanted to see how yall relationships are with your dealer. ",1516356909.0

So my mother being the caring women she is, figures it would do me no harm to slip me a Hydrocodone here and there to help me manage the pain. Keep in mind my mother was a single parent already balls deep into her heroin addiction, being a fibromyalgia sufferer herself. Well we refrain from taking me to the doctor as her 3 month supply of Vikes and 3 month supply of Tramadols kept me humble. Of course
My mom favored heroin so when she would nod off, I would grab handfuls of pain pills, mostly self-medicating but trading the pills for weed as well. Fast forward a few years later, my mom isn’t fucking w D no more after being forced into rehab and shes no longer prescribed Vicodin but takes 50 mg’s of Tramadol 6 times a day. At that point in time, I’m aware of my dependence on pain pills but haven’t realized my addiction. I was lucky considering my mother had a pharmacy in her purse and I wasn’t pumping out hundreds of dollars to feed my addiction, all I would do was sneak into my moms purse while she was off at her NA meetings (oh the irony) and get my supply for the next day.
Well soon enough I wasn’t a child anymore and the fibro flares kept on just getting worse so my mom cut down to 3 tramadols a day so that I could have 3 a day, getting a month supply at a time now being that she was a recovering addict. 
I’m 19 now on the verge of moving out, aware of the fact that I’m most likely an addict already and I know depending on my mother for tramadols and/or pain relief isn’t going to last very long, I’m lucky if I have another year.  Nowadays I don’t even know if it’s the Fibromyalgia or Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia or just fucking withdrawals , but I need a drug with me at all times. I smoke pot daily but without pain pills, it just makes the pain worse. Whenever I run out of tramadols early and have to wait a week for the refill, my poor mother has to suffer but I’m off into the streets substituting opiates with anything I can get my hands on (MDMA, bars, klonopin, high doses of gabapentin) being that any opiate other than Heroin is rare to come by and I’ve seen my mother destroy herself with that addiction. (Keep in mind I’m one of those people that gets the heavenly recreational effects out of tramadol). 
I know it’s only a matter of time until I run out of safe ways to self medicate , physicians never believe me because they either think I’m doctor shopping or they don’t believe Fibromyalgia is a disease or blah blah blah. I’m very scared I’m on a path to self destruction but I honestly can’t see myself living comfortably and pain-free without pain killers. Heroin is a huge no-no for me at the moment but I know soon enough, I’ll become so desperate and engulfed in the pain of Fibromyalgia that I’ll give in to the Hell that I’ve seen destroy so many others. 
This is a cry for help, prescription painkillers are a beautiful thing for chronic pain patients but the addiction is ugly and the insurance companies are constantly fucking us, forcing us to self medicate and turning us into fiends and “criminals”.

7rh2l8,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7rh2l8/a_guide_to_audiobooks/,4,https://redd.it/7rh2l8,sloan_fitch,A Guide To Audiobooks,"Audiobooks are an underrated medium. Some people annoy me, I mention audiobooks to an in-law and they be like ""I don't do audiobooks."" Well, your loss. I don't think it hurts to read a real book/e-book but I got no time to sit down and read unless it's a book that I love. I could be pumping iron, doing pull-ups, running track, running in general, riding a bike, building shit, or cleaning while listening to an audio book.


Sure, we could watch TV or YouTube videos while we do things but then one is liable to encounter the tempatatio to stop and look at the TV or computer display.

&nbsp;


Firstly, I'd like to talk about how I ""discovered"" audiobooks. One day, early in my dope consuming career I was between refills and was feeling a bit ""bored"", not very motivated but definitely not in withdrawal. If I had not gotten drugs the following day, would I have been in WD? I honestly don't know but probably not. I was at the point where I craved but wasn't compelled by the biology of dope-sickness. At future points in time whne I was dope-sick, audiobooks proved to make the experience of lying awake a bit more tolerable.

&nbsp;

It was that quiet early March evening when I finally decided to look up the audio version of a book that I was interested in reading. You see, I was reasarching how sometihng worked in a TV based sci-fi universe and someone posted an answer on a forum to a question related to the topic that referenced a certain space opera.


So I mosied on over to YouTube and waddaya know, the book was there. Then there was the sequel, and that was on YouTube as well until I got to the half-way point in the book when it was suddenly removed for copyright reasons.

&nbsp;

So I could go to my favorite free download venue, or sign-up with a legit service. Not everyone knows how to or is comfortable dowloading things from the dark recesses of the net. That's fine, there are plenty of Audiobooks on YouTube and Audible. An audible account is pretty neat but it never hurts your wallet to check if the book you want is available on YouTube before you buy it.

&nbsp;


When signing up for an audible trial they typically offer a free book via an Audible ""credit"". Bear in mind that if you're signing up for the free book, you better cancel your subsription renewal after you redeem your free audiobook. That's the biggest complaint. Some folks sign up for the free trial, get billed for months and then realize they weren't taking advantage of it but wating money.

Even when that does happen, such people would at least accumulate a bunch of Audible credits so it's not a waste if they start looking for books that may interests them.

&nbsp;


In the base tier of service you get one ""credit"" per month. For a little bit more you can get two credits each month. Audible credits can be purchased in packs of three for a little over thirty bux. A credit allows you to buy almost any book whether it costs $5 or $40+. So it definitely pays off when gettin a book that costs more than $12.


Furthermore, Audible membrship also ensures that you can get books at a discounted rate if you decide to buy an audiobook via your credit card as opposed to using audible credits. Handy when you run out of audible credits for the month but don't want to buy three of them all at once.

&nbsp;


**Recap**

If you're feeling down, want to lay down but know you're not going to be able to sleep an audiobook might be right for you! You can get started by doing any one of the following:


* Find a book that interests you then see if the audiobook version exists on YouTube.


* Get an Audible account. They're always offering a freebie for newbs. Members get at least one credit good for one audiobook per month and discounted rates on most titles via a member's discount.


* Get the audibook by shadier means.



&nbsp;

**Warnings**

* Don't sign up with Audible if all you want is a free book and to never use it again. Otherwise, set a reminder on your phone to cancel the recurring payment.


* If you find a book that is part of a series that you end up liking on YouTube, be ready to buy the audiobook because chances are the sequel is not on YouTube if you end up really liking the book.


&nbsp;


**Audible Specific Tips**

* There is a setting in the mobile app which allows you to switch form standard quality to high quality. Obviously the HQ setting will cause audiobooks to use more memory but I would assume that higher quality is *better*.


* You can use your desktop/laptop based browser to download any audiobook that you've purchased in MP3 format so that you can transfer it to any friggin' device. 


* However, the app on iOS and Android provides a very streamlined experience. For example, if you pause a book and then open that book at a later time on the same or a different device it will offer to resume from where you left last left off.



&nbsp;

Bottom line, I discovered this made time pass when feeling a sense of malaise and discovered a specific literary universe that made life more bearable. After reading that book four times I started branching out into other books and frankly I don't think any of them are better than my first but I'm hoping I'll find something better eventually. That said, I've enjoyed the all of it nonetheless.


Perhaps for some of us this can be an alternative addiction. Audobooks, as stated earlier are also great way to enhance cycling, commuting, driving, working out, cleaning and many other activities.


BTW there are non-bootleg places to get free audiobooks but their libraries don't seem to have what I'm looking for. If this post doesn't get down-voted, I'll consider sharing such options in the future if I find any that are confirmed to be safe to visit.",1516351894.0

(shitpost?),"For some background I’m 19 and have been using IV heroin for over a year (not consecutively) and daily since early October 2017. I’ve used a variety of drugs to self medicate for depression since early 2016. Since going cold turkey a bit more than a week ago I’ve hardly had any cravings for the stuff. What gets to me is that opiates are by far my favourite class of drugs and yet the only serious cravings I get even when dopesick are for alcohol, which I can’t stand.

Essentially what the fuck is wrong with me? Why can I control myself pretty well with a drug that I really love and have been using consistently for a longer time and yet only have that addict drive for dirty alcohol?

Don’t get me wrong, I’m glad I’m having an ok time getting away from daily opiate use but I’m just baffled by the fact that I’m more driven to drink. I wouldn’t mind continuing to use opiates and benzos in moderation (key word) in the long term and set up a good system, I just really don’t want to become a drunk again. My alcoholic phase was my lowest point and I never want to repeat it.

I fucked up in the beginning but got my shit together, mainly cause I was sick of going to jail. I had about 16 months clean when I got of paper in November.  Did good for a little while . But I just kept obsessing about heroin. 

Then I finally caved. I picked up and convinced myself it's ok because I'm just going to smoke it, (I get tar only where I live, which is where gambling, weed, and even prostitution in the smaller county's is all legal) . After I did that I wasn't impressed , so I blamed it on the subs in my system, even though I knew that wasn't it. Picked up again but this time I shot it. Before I knew it I was back to everyday use. But this time it sucked . I was constantly throwing up while high. I had one connect who sucked ass.  I was always waiting forever to get shit. In the matter of a month I fucked up the money I had saved. I never felt good. 

Which got me thinking maybe I got some preconceived notions that when I first got hooked and went on a three year run , it was the best thing ever. But now that I look back at it, maybe 5 times in the 3 years of using heroin that I had an amazing rememberable night. The whole time I was clean I latched on to how great it was. When in reality it's good for about 30 seconds with the initial rush and that's it. It was so easy for me to walk away from this shit again. I used everyday in December. Then about 16 days ago I was like fuck this and haven't used since.

I guess what I'm getting at is anyone that's clean right now and fantasizing about opiates just remember they suck ass.  I'm glad I relapsed cause now I know I'm not missing shit. ",1516340587.0

I was going to put it in a bag and tape it to the inside of my khaki pants I’ll be wearing tomorrow.

7rfcfi,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7rfcfi/am_i_wrong/,17,https://redd.it/7rfcfi,opiatedabs,Am I wrong??,"So, my boyfriend and I use bth. Right now we’ve been staying in our truck, because our house burnt down in the Northern California fires. Idk if I can post that but whatever. We were renters so we didn’t have home insurance and everything just got fucked. We’ve been staying in the truck ever since. So we’re constantly driving. Before the fires, we were constantly driving a lot too to go and hustle or he would drive out of town for work but now it’s 24/7. 

My issue is, he’s constantly nodding off while driving! And it really irks me. I’ve always been that person who wouldn’t even get into a car if someone had a few beers I would’ve walked home instead. I had one cousin die in a drunk driving accident when she was 18 going to prom, and her brother my other cousin got into a drunk driving accident at 18 as well and he was in a coma for a very long time and now he’s severely handicap, so I was always scared of that happening to me. I know nodding off while driving isn’t the same as being drunk, but to me it’s just as bad. 

During our two year relationship he’s totaled one car, had 4 fender benders, 1 of those fender benders was about a week and a half ago and the front end of our truck is fucked but it’s still driveable. Thank god we have insurance because we’re in a rental car right now, and it’s way nicer and more comfortable living in this than the truck. Plus, the truck was driveable but kinda dangerous. 

I’m sure you’re thinking ‘well, why don’t you just drive then’ and trust me I try to drive. Problem with that is, my license got suspended a few months ago from overdue tickets and it’s going to cost over $1,000 to get that back. I could really give a shit about getting pulled over with a suspended license vs. putting all of us in danger( I say us because we also have our 11 month old blue nose pittbull named Luna) I would rather get in trouble anyday over nodding off at the wheel and wrecking. 

Honestly this is pretty much the only thing we fight about. We don’t even really fight about it. It’s more like me constantly yelling at him, asking if he’s okay to drive when I notice his eyes closing, but this goes on multiple multiple times a day and I’m getting really fuckin’ frustrated. What pisses me off even more is that he pretends like he’s not nodding off while driving! He’s constantly responding with dumb shit when I say ‘are you ok do I need to drive’ or my outbursts saying ‘watch out!’ He’ll respond with ‘I’m just really hot’ and then turn the air conditioner on when it’s raining and cold outside lol he claims to nod off when he gets too hot all the time. I know that I can do that too, but with him it’s just a cop out. He’s in denial or trying to prove something and he just looks hella dumb instead. 

There’s tons of other shit that he try’s to blame on why he’s nodding off or whatever but at the end of the day how bad is it gonna have to get for him to realize it’s not okay to drive like this? I hate being that girlfriend that’s always bitching but I feel like it’s different because it’s regarding my safety and his safety and our dog’s safety.

What can I say to possibly get another prescription? Do you think I have to resort to the DNM?

7rdfp9,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7rdfp9/permanent_tolerance_to_opioids/,5,https://redd.it/7rdfp9,adalone,Permanent tolerance to opioids?,"Hey friends,

I posted this to /r/drugs but no one ever commented, so I thought I would post it over here and see if anyone could help!

This has been bugging me for a while and I'm not really sure what the cause is. I used to take kratom once a week or so around 2 years ago just to improve my mood on some days. For the first year I was doing this, I had no tolerance increases and took the same 6g dose as I always have, and the effects were always great.

At some point I stopped taking it for a while, something like 3 months. When I went back to kratom again afterward, the effects were diminished by at least 70%. Same batch, same dose, and with a huge break between use.

Now at first I thought this was a kratom issue, so I tried rotating some strains (which didn't seem to help). The reason I'm making this post though is because I just had my wisdom teeth extracted and was prescribed Vicodin, which isn't considered that strong but I still barely felt any euphoria from 10-15mg.

On a day where the pain hurt particularly bad I was able to get a few oxycodone from my parents that they had lying around. I ended up taking 25mg total of 5-325 oxycodone but still didn't get any euphoria or warmth, just kind of tired.

I used to get such strong effects from even 10mg oxy a couple of years ago, what gives? I am not a frequent opioid user in the slightest so it doesn't seem like traditional tolerance to me. The effects that I remember were a warm, lightheaded feeling that made me want to melt into the couch. It was pretty nice to feel effects like this even from something as benign as kratom.

Any insight would be greatly appreciated!",1516313470.0

I've had a few blog style writings in the past that were pretty successful and a few days ago my AMA on being an addict and living in the crack motel made the front page. I've been journaling lately and I'd like some feedback. I'm curious if I should continue, if anyone would actually want to read it? Without further ado...

**Unknown date**
Today was a roller coaster. Woke up arguing with Casey, my girl. I think… I can’t really remember but that’s how most mornings begin. Smooth called and it was payday so all bets were off. I got dressed and Smooth had his sister drive to the motel to pick me up to grab my paycheck. 

I got into the back of a decent car and there was a beautiful pit bull pup in the back seat with me. Smooths sister is a bit darker than him, sometimes I’m pretty sure slim is mixed. I walked into Got Burger and put on my mask. I had to work in 90 minutes and I’m grabbing $180, like I couldn’t wait. Thankfully the mask works and no one suspects anything deceitful.

I originally wanted a $60 of heroin and $20 of crack. The boss overpaid me by about $40 so I decided to get more. Unfortunately he only had $60 worth of heroin on him, some drug dealer. He offered a huge rock of crack if I spent an extra $20 so I went ahead and spent the $100 like a stupid addict. I had just told them I don’t even like more than $20 worth of crack and almost never buy more than that. Smooth insisted I “smoke the crack, man, don’t shoot it” and went on a long tangent about how I needed to start “loving life” and once again mentions when Brian shoved ice cubes down my pants. Finally he hands over the drugs.

We walked from my job a few blocks to his uncles, who also smokes crack. Since he was letting me use his pipe and house I told him I would smoke the rock with him. First things first though, I shoot the dope in his bathroom. Casey’s Christmas present to me was a beautiful red hoodie with built in headphones for draw strings and I use these as a turniquette. This makes me feel guilty. The dope is surprisingly good for smooth who usually sells poor quality heroin. The $60 isn’t that horrible sized either, but it is on the small side. This dope was the first dope that felt like real heroin, and not fentanyl, in a long time. I was able to do a lot without being in sleepy zombie mode or ODed. The high was more euphoric and long lasting. I did finish the whole $60 in the hour I was there though. I let both smooth and his uncle smoke my rock and end up getting 4 giant hits off it myself making it not a bad deal. My ears ring but i don’t throw up.

As I expected I shouldn’t have bought that much crack. Only the first 2 hits were good. It leaves me shaky with a lot of anxiety despite the heroin kicking strong. Smooths uncle makes a big deal of me sharing the crack and offers to have his man drop me off a pack for free to try. Smooth flips out at this attempt to poach me as a customer but it doesn’t escalate. I looked at my phone and saw I was going to be late for work and did the last of my shit.
Thankfully the crack was fading enough so I could at least appear normal on the outside when I entered work. Or at least normal enough where no one said anything. I work with a bunch of straight laced Palestinians who would have cut into me if they suspected I was high. I genuinely love them. Eventually the shaking and anxiety cease and I can enjoy the heroin. I don’t get why I even speedball since every time I do just heroin it’s better. 

I do very well at work for awhile but quickly become emotional as is common with heroin. My post on reddit had gotten 8k upvotes and was huge. I know it sounds lame but I was really proud of this. I see myself as such a loser, never been able to create art. But I’ve had a few really huge forum threads over the years. If I compiled it all it’d probably be 100 pages of a book and have 500k-1 million views, ten thousand comments. Not just random message board posts, legit essay style pieces and long responses to questions as well as tons of short stories. All chronicling this horrible addiction of mine. It’s weird to be such a nobody in life… but online so many people enjoy my writing and wish me support. It hurts me that Casey dislikes this. It’s not even her making fun of it, calling it lame. It’s that she just doesn’t care… she wouldn’t take the time to bother to read it unless it pertained to her and she could be upset with it. When I told her about the numbers of views and comments I achieved all she said was not to write about her.  

I tried to apologize to her for some past wrongs and she tells me I bother her with the shit I say. I don’t get why she’s with me as it just seems like she hates me. As the night got worse I told her I was struggling and asked for some help, maybe just to be assured I’m loved but she has gone to sleep and doesn’t respond.
The whole shift at work I was tossing and turning in my brain over spending the last $70 of my paycheck or getting Casey a gift. I ended up confessing my cravings to my coworkers who took my phone and made it so smooths number was both deleted and blocked so I couldn’t find it again. I wish I wouldn’t have gotten high in the first place. I will likely have minor withdrawals tomorrow. I am still proud I won that battle though. Before this at work I got very emotional and upset inside after being minorly chastised for making a few small mistakes on orders. I kept an calm face throughout though. After Khalid deleted Smooths numbers I gave him a hug. I make $8 an hour under the table cooking burgers for a Palestinian who did 10.5  years in the feds for money laundering. I work with 2 stoners, a gay Albanian immigrant whose Americanized, one dude fresh from Yemen who I am good friends with despite him not knowing much English. The rest are Palestinians. Being around so many middle easterners reminds me of high school but I’ve grown to really love the people I work with. All the wonderful Muslim people who wish me the best and provide real friendship make me question some of the political beliefs I subscribe to. I am in no way conservative, at least not like other conservatives. I’m not one of these people calling for us not to basically ignore all these acts of terror. However when I see articles that reflect this viewpoint they seem hateful and I question if they’re on the right side. Too many Muslim people have just been too good of friends to me throughout life.
I came back to Derrick and Dustons and smoked. Derrick has been taking bars for days and it makes me sad to see addictive behavior in him as he just generally seemed like a stoner. 

I get picked up at 11am and have to get some sleep. Maybe I’ll get Kratom tomorrow. I hope that for once Casey and I can just get along and I can enjoy being with her. Maybe I’ll just submit to everything just to avoid fighting. I think I will, half to see that happens, and half because I want to remember what it’s like to just spend the night with the girl I love without arguing, just enjoying each other’s company. I doubt it will happen but the goal sounds nice so maybe it will be worth eating shit. The downside is that there is a very slim chance this will work and we’ll probably still fight and I’ll have played yellow for nothing.
Best of luck 



**1-18 2:17am**

Just got out of work and I’m smoking a joint at Derricks. Today was a rough day at work but my drug intake has been greatly reduced. On Monday I did probably 5 or 6 $20 packs, Tuesday I did 3, and today just 1. I’m going to try to just take Kratom tomorrow and ween myself down. I feel retarded for getting a physical addiction again but I’ve done it a million times so I’m apathetic to any regret. 

I’ve been getting the $20s through Rachal whose been living with me in the motel. She’s a butch lesbian so it’s not weird and although there are some idiosyncrasies of hers I dislike for the most part she is easy to live with. She’s been trustworthy and I enjoy her company so I’ve let her stay.

The dope she gets is weird, but good. It’s little light red rocks that kind of look like make up. It even draws up pink/light red. It comes in little tiny ziplock bags like I used to see in east Detroit. The guy lives right next to the motel and most times we can cop within 20 or 30 minutes total. This feels like real heroin, I’ve gone irresponsibly hard on it two days in a row and didn’t fall out. Instead I was nodding hard, even when standing up. It remind me of when I first came home from prison and was getting high like in the old days. I’ve been booking Rachel up fat in exchange for using her connection.

I have to get to college Wednesday. If I don’t get my classes set now I never will. I’m fairly confident I will get it done but you never know with a junky.

I’ve got to lower my weed and drug intake then quit. I’m going to start making a daily goals list. Today I didn’t smoke a cigarette.

Today is the first day of the week I go into work without any heroin in me and it’s a 9 hour shift. It’s going to be hard not to smoke weed after that one. I do notice Kratom holds me over better than heroin.


**1-18**

Not a bad first day off heroin, but I only took the Kratom 3 hours ago. The 30 half gram capsules of Kratom make me actually feel slightly good, above sober baseline, but yet the heroin withdrawal creeps below the surface. Even though my mood is decent and my outlook positive there’s a tainted feeling running deep within my bones that I’ve come to associate with coming off a heroin binge more than withdrawal. If I have been clean a few months and binge for 2 days I will not feel withdrawal but more of a hangover. The main symptom of which is a generally scummy, sickly feeling, but nothing close to actually being sick. It serves as a strong warning I never heed.
It’s 4 hours after the Kratom dose now and I’m hitting the other vices hard. I’ve drank two large glasses of real coffee and I find I crave instant and feel the familiar nostalgia of the coffee I used to make in prison. I rounded scoop Keefe Alturo blend instant coffee, 2 non sugar sweetener, and a scoop of whey protein.


**1-19** 

Relapsed today kind of bad. I blew $150 in about an hour. I barely got anything out of it so at least it won’t kick my withdrawals back in too long. My grandmother sent me some money so it wasn’t a huge financial loss and I’ll still be able to meet my goal of buying an Xbox one. 

I woke up after after maybe 3 hours of sleep already in pretty mild withdrawals. Smooth had been calling me which was my first trigger. I was supposed to go to College today but had no bus fare and was withdrawing too hard. When I come back from home Monday I’m going to grab some Kratom and get a ride to college so I can’t procrastinate any further. This is my last week and I absolutely have to make this happen.

I ended up caving and had my grandma send me $120 and called Smooth. He was over in about ten minutes which is really rare for the doorman. I spent the $10 I had on me and the shot took me off E. After all the dope I did I never got much beyond that. 

When I went to pick up the Western Union I ran into Rachel who was on her way to cop. I gave her $20 to grab me one of her bags. When she returned with it she told me her dealer had ran out of baggies and put both of ours in the same bag which was a lie and a way for her to take half of the $20 I paid for. I had trusted her more than this but it didn’t surprise me when she did it. I don’t plan on fucking with her anymore.

I ended up getting a dime of dope, followed by a $50 more dope, a $20 of crack, a $15 of heroin and $10 of crack, followed by another $15 of heroin and $10 of crack on front. So now I have to see him to pay him back. I’m going to try my hardest not to get more which shouldn’t be hard since his dope sucks. If I had a reliable connect for good dope I’d be a lot worse off right now.

I can’t stand being a slave to so many substances and I don’t know how I’m going to kick them all in time for school. The withdrawal won’t be too bad and I might just maintain on Kratom. I just have to come to the decision not to pick up the phone and call the dopeman. Once I get in school I’ll have something to drive me. I moved here to get away from drugs but your vices have a way of finding you.

I remember how I found heroin here in Ypsi. I was living at the ¾ house at the time but was already doing Kratom and smoking weed. I was walking home from from work one day and saw a skinny dude with coke bottle glasses smoking a cigarette. I needed a light so I struck up a conversation. As we were smoking he asked if I smoked herb, I assured him I did. He then asked me if I did acid and once again I said yes. I wanted some bud so I went up to his apartment and scored. I deduced he was a junky pretty quick but it was a week or two before I made the call and asked if he could get dope. That was the beginning of all my serious problems here in Ypsi. 

Brian’s apartment was basically a trap. It was technically his girlfriend, Katy’s apartment but he ran it. Brian was something of a professional middle man, the type that supports his habit by having both an amazing connect and a pretty good clientele of people unable to score for themselves. Dealers would often hang out at the apartment to sell as well. I went through Brian for a while before he fucked me over on some packs. I ended up meeting Rachel at Brian’s but didn’t actually hang out with her until later.

Casey and I have been getting along and she has a job interview Monday so I’m very proud of her. For all the problems we’ve had I know she really loves me and has stuck by me through numerous county jail bits and parole/probation violation programs. I see her Sunday and I won’t be feeling too well from lack of heroin so I hope we can get along. When I’m half dead from withdrawal it always makes me feel better just to have her there with me.

I need to make a plan. Today is Friday and I’ve already fucked up today. A bottle of 30 Kratom caps is $10. I’m going to try to buy 3 tomorrow for Saturday, Sunday, and Monday. Tomorrow will be a rough shift with only Kratom but Sunday shouldn’t be too bad since I don’t work. Monday I’ll take my Kratom and go to college to sign up for classes. If I need to get another bottle to make it through work then so be it. Once I get 3 days taking just Kratom I should be over the worst of it. I refuse to dose Kratom more than once a day which means about half of a day is spent in withdrawal since the Kratom doesn’t hold me a full 24.

I’ve been stressing about Casey tonight as is typical after drug use. When I’m in the right state of mind I don’t stress more than I need to. I worry about her being with other men but more I worry about her not loving or wanting me anymore. Like maybe she just talks to me and sees me once a week as a favor to me. I can’t expect her to stay in every night though, we aren’t even technically together. It’s hard to hold down a girl when you aren’t physically there. In reality she makes time for me me every week and we talk every day so I shouldn’t worry so much. Lately I’ve been the one to text first though and that sucks. I just want her to be totally in love with me again. Sometimes I get these fleeting thoughts of suicide that tell me people would understand if I killed myself. Like Casey would understand how much I love her and how much it hurt not to have her heart. Maybe the courts, judges, and POs would understand how hard of a battle it is for me to get clean, such a battle that I killed myself instead of fighting. These thoughts fade though and even in withdrawal I don’t feel suicidal. Withdrawal makes me apathetic to everything… my life, my problems with Casey. Sometimes i wonder if it feels better to be half-high and suicidal or withdrawing and empty. 

It felt therapeutic to write that. I want people to eventually read these and I feel like writing about my girl problems is boring. There’s nothing more pathetic than a clingy boyfriend and I don’t want to be that.
On a lighter note things were pretty wild at the crack motel today. I heard 4 instances of prostitutes fucking loudly with the fake screams and moans common to prostitutes. Then when I was smoking a cigarette in the hallway I saw a couple exit a room and begin arguing over crack.
“Give me my half! I have the shooter”
“Break it and half and let me pick mine!” 
“You aren’t getting the pipe until you break me off!”
Eventually the girl busted out the crack pipe to her mans dismay, as they were only a few feet from me.
“He doesn’t care! He lives in Ypsi!” She said in regards to me seeing them smoke. I had just taken a hit myself, little did they know. I left them to argue and as I was walking back to the room I saw the Indian female manager quickly moving towards then and was glad I wasn’t going to be around for that.

It’s almost the end of the work shift now and I asked Derrick if he wanted to smoke after but he’s just going home and going to sleep so it looks like I’m going to be all alone in the motel room. The room feels like a jail cell during these times and I’m certain I’m going to break down and start crying the moment I’m alone. I think I’ll put on a podcast and try to forget my situation. Hopefully I’ll sleep late and won’t have to suffer too many hours alone by myself. There’s nothing to look forward to until Sunday when I see Casey. I think if I looked at things objectively I’d see that it’s over, that it’s been over, that it wasn’t that good to begin with. I don’t want to accept that because I couldn’t imagine feeling more alone than I already do.

I think I’ll post these on the opiates subreddit and see what kind of response I get.

7rp2q1,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7rp2q1/that_binge_last_week_on_sleep_deprivation_and/,0,https://redd.it/7rp2q1,sloan_fitch,That Binge Last Week. On sleep deprivation and being on time for work.,"I was on day two of a dope binge. The night before I barely slept three hours if that much because I was ripping bag after bag. After a long work day I went to visit a friend's house for a few hours ~~to work on something~~  and I didn't get home 'til a little after about 5AM. When I was ready to leave my friend was nodding out in standing position and I was just like ""dude I'm leaving now, 'nuff stalling.""

I think it was the night before where I was at another friend's house working on a project with them but I got home much earlier, a bit before 3AM.

Anyway, back to that night where I got home at 5AM. It was day two of my binge and I was already quite sleep deprived. An hour early while I was sitting at my friend's kitchen table I kept snapping into ""day dream"" states. I don't know what you call it but it also continued once I got home to my desk. 


&nbsp;

These daydreams are always peculiar but usually nothing negative. This time they were a bit off-putting. Like dark flashbacks, but they weren't flash backs to any thing in particular. It's like one second I'm in a day dream where I'm at work talking to a person, then I'm back at my desk and it feels like I was just at a different place at a different time of the day. Sort of disorienting I suppose. Despite nothing intrusive happening in my thoughts, I just felt negative as fuck. Maybe it was because I lacked control. Maybe it was because it was the second day of sleep deprivation. I don't remember two a day dope binge with sleep deprivation in the past. I usually get a good night's sleep on the second night regardless of my dope consumption.

&nbsp;

Well, I really don't know how to describe it but I felt ""dark"" while fading in and out of these innocuous daydreams. Aside from it being the second night of sleep deprivation, I did consume a lower amount of dope than I did on day one.

Maybe the reduction in dope compared to the prior day affected my serotonin levels? Not quite withdrawal, just some psych effects.

&nbsp;

Well I had work at 11AM. After eating at 5:15 I went to my desk to watch videos and digest my meal. I planned to go to bed soon. Next thing I know it's 7AM, I must've fallen asleep. I intended on getting up to go to bed but dozed off to sleep once more in chair in an upright position.


Woke up once more, at 9AM and probably said, ""ahh shit, time to get up."" So I did, and proceeded to put a Jimmy Dean sandwich in the microwave and made a cup of coffee on the Keurig. While the coffee was brewing, I went back to my desk to watch some videos and let the coffee cool down a little bit.


Then bam, I'm still at my desk but when I look at the time it's 10:58. This time I definitely said ""ahh shit..."" I had to be at work in two minutes, it takes me thirty minutes to get to work. I was surprised by that, I've never fallen back asleep after having physically gotten up to walk to my kitchen and sitting down. Perhaps this swivel chair is dangerously comfortable. 

Lesson, I don't know. Just thought it was a funny story. I'll set my wrist alarm next time well before bed as part of a alarm contingency plan. In fact I'll do that right now... Set four alarms on the wrist + the ones on my phone to ensure a single hit of the snooze bar does not defeat me in the AM.",1516434079.0

this happened years ago. probably 2014. i'm not the best storyteller but i think this one's worth sharing.


i was living with my mom and brother at the time and had just come home from picking up a rather large amount by my standards (0.75g - in 3 separate 0.25g bags). so i went in the bathroom and did my thing, got high, and went to room to chill. mostly browsing reddit and chilling with the dog.



then i realized that i was missing the 2 x 0.25g bags. i started worrying a bit and retraced my steps from my room to the bathroom and back, repeatedly. scoured my bedroom too. shit! what if my mom or brother found it!? i finally came to the conclusion that the dog must have eaten them and was slowly starting to come to terms with the fact that my dog might die and it would all be my fault. and my family would find out i was using again (i was hiding it from them at the time). idk if any of you guys have ever been in a situation like this but it fucking SUCKED! i love my dog to death and it slowly started to dawn on me that i'm gonna end up killing him because i was too worried about getting high to be responsible with my shit.



at this point i realized the dog was perfectly fine and would probably be showing some signs of an overdose if he had in fact eaten my dope so i started to calm down a bit. then i realized i didn't FULLY trace my steps - found my 2 bags untouched just sitting on the stairs that lead from the foyer into the main living area.

I miss the days in high school where I could take 2-4 hydros and be flying. In fact, this time last year I was able to get nice and high from 30-40mg hydro.

I got out of rehab in the summer and was only a week clean. Relapsed with kratom. Took my usual 5 grams and I was feeling it so much that I was literally nodding.

Now I know tolerance resets after a long enough time. But I’ve heard stories of tolerance building quicker even after taking long breaks. Like the first few  times are more potent, and then tolerance sky rockets faster than if you were still new to this.

Any thoughts?",1516420269.0

Im a long time addict, who has been usung steadily and everyday for around 8 years, currently Ive managed slightly over 2 months of clean time from Heroin.

My question is whether or not the heroin crisis is impacting highschoolers to the extreme levels which it is being shown inside the school.  I mean there must have been a warning poster, anti drug club, picture, artwork, or story every 15 feet about heroin or opiates.  It was almost as if the school was ground zero for a drug cartel or open air trap.  Kids these days are really pushing things hard if they are doing this shit instead of smoking some weed or drinking a few beers.  After seeing all that propaganda I was terrified for kids and their parents of this new generation.

This month I’ve taken less than I’m supposed to for a few days. Years ago I would blow through pills so fast it wasn’t even funny. 20-25 norcos a day plus Xanax and booze to add. I couldnt control myself. This is to all the pain patients out there. It’s possible to make them last. I have my girlfriend give me my daily doses and don’t go searching for the bottles. This is an agreement I made that was my idea. It works amazingly. No more withdrawals, no worrying about not passing drug tests, not having to supplement with kratom at the end of the month. This makes life so much easier. Anyone that calls you a hopeless addict for being in pain management has no idea what it’s like to live with that stigma. These meds make life bearable. Yeah I enjoy taking them. The joy comes from being able to function like a normal person for once. There is nothing wrong with that and don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.

hi guys, this is my first post on reddit and i just want to get this out somewhere so here we go. i just turned 18 and i've been abusing all opaites that i can get my hands on for about 2 months. it started with me beeing bored and looking through our medecine cabinet and finding some tramadol and codeine. i tried both of those but did not get any effect at all which is a bit wierd but anyways, a week later i was over at my cousins house and stumbeld upon some oxys 10mg that my aunt had gotten for a surgey that was completly heald and they were just laying there so i stole like 4 pills or something. i tried it later that day and i was in love. i live realy close to my cousins and i know when they get home after school and work cuz we're basicly nieghbours so a couple of days later i decided to go back and steal the whole box ( we have a spare key for thier house). the following month consisted of me being high atleast every other day, even when i was over at my friends. i used to go in to thier bathroom and snort a pill or two. some of my friends knew about my drug habbit and wanted me to stop and i did so after about a month beacuse of multiple reasons, one was that i didn't want to get physicly addicted. but i was still mentaly addicted so started to steal everything i could get my hands on when i couldn't stand a life without being high anymore. i stole coughsyroup from my grandmother (old and not in use, which dosen't justify it), tramadol from a friends dad (was prescribed in 2012 and had not been touched since, still dosen't justify it). but the one i am most ashamed is what i have been doing recently, i've been stealing from my mother who had a back surgery about 2 weeks ago and the latest time i did so was about an hour ago, and that's why i'm writing this. i'm such a fucking brat, how the fuck can a son steal her moms medication when she has done everthing for me. i can't stand my self and this is the last time i'm doing it, i don't wanna hurt my mom but i just can't help myself. what i usally do is carefully take out a pill (oxy) from the blister pack, empty out the powder and then put the empty pill back in the blister and try to make it look as if it has not been tamperd with. the reason i've been stealing and not buying from a plug is becuase i live in a very small town and i dont have a lot of money. so instead of just staying away from this shit i steal it from the ones who need it the most. I AM DISGUSTED BY MYSELF, I'M HONESTLY THE WORST PERSON EVER. i'm such a spoled fucking asshole and i don't deserve the loving mother i have.

I to trade  my MacBook to my dealer to get a G today because I ran out of money I've had to do this before he never gives me any problems. I always pay him back always get it back everything's always gravy but today my dad found out that I did it and is absolutely shitting a brick.  well I take that back he did not find out I did it, he's 99% sure.  he knows I did it yesterday and he knows I went and bought  it back yesterday. he suspects I did it again today.  He is now threatening to take my car kick me out of the house.  pretty much cut me off in general and put me on the street in the cold and I unfortunately live with him work for him and he has the power to completely ruin my life.  I have attached a Imgur  link of a bunch of random photos of our house as he is not here and he demands that  I send him a photo of my laptop at our house I was wondering if anybody could keep me from freezing to death and keep me in the warmth of my house by photo shopping a 13 inch aluminum MacBook Pro in anyone of those photos that I can send him so I can stay at home tonight as well as in the future as far is just continuing living here and keeping my car and job and life as I will be buying back my laptop tomorrow morning. So if I can pull this off by Photoshop tonight he will have no clue and I will get to maintain my current life and I must tell you that I am not fit out for street life. I would absolutely get myself arrested on purpose just to make sure that I was warm and safe and then I'll probably hang myself after a day or two in there once I realize that I couldn't hack it in there since I was absolutely miserable the couple of times I spent 24 hours in county any help would be greatly appreciated thank you very much.  Also I need this almost immediately 30 minutes to an hour maximum and I will send rags or Narcan to the person who's photo end of using any of you do not need either of those things I will send them to someone of your choosing I sure hope I sent the right imgur link and not the one  of me and my girl naked doing weird stuff

Tldr. Please save my life by photo shopping an aluminal MacBook Pro into one or as many of these photos as you feel like so that I have a couple options to pick the most realistic for our house and I will send the the best one to him and the person that's photo I end up using I will send five packs of rigs to. If you don't use rags I will send a package of Narcan or can you send Riggs to someone else on behalf of you but please help me people also I need this in the next 30 minutes to an hour maximum

Just got about an hour extension maybe 2. So if you think you're late to the party please don't give up send me what you got I've got one so far, my dad's not the brightest man but I think he will  recognize something is a little fishy with it but I will absolutely be sending it if I don't get something else but please try to send me something if you can

Lol. I only get tested once a month, when I have my appt too. Pretty sweet setup really. The sub is working fine, really well actually when you consider the pressures I’ve been under, it’s probably the main thing that’s kept me from going out and just destroying myself. 

So, I am trying to stay clean, but only sort of. I still like to get high. I still have some etizolam on the way, etc. I actually found that alcohol seems to have an especially strong reaction w bupe relative to other opioids. I had one (stiff) drink around noon the other day and was pretty fucked. Mostly, tho I don’t really feel a buzz when I take my dose (8mg). And it’s only been a few days on this script (before that did about 3-4 days on subs, then a couple days with just a little tramadol, then a day and a half totally clear). 

So I know I’m gonna have to figure out how my body responds to bupe on my own, but just like ballpark figures would be helpful. Like if I want to get high, how long do I have to wait? From what I’ve read it seems like I could skip a single dose (which I’ve been taking at noon) and sleep in the next day and try to make it a few hours, then get high. My tolerance was getting out of hand at the end and I’m naturally quite tolerant, so it’s hard to believe anything could get ME high. I got a plug on some good pressed roxis tho and that fent got me decently high at the end. I figure I’ll prob get settle into some kind of routine of taking a little tolerance break and shooting fent maybe a couple times earlier in the month, but stay stable on sub most of the time. 

I do worry about my tolerance but really 8mg of sub is plenty to make me feel ok even if i do spike my tolerance a little so that should be fine. Speaking of, i actually want to experiment with lower doses, as I think there really might be something to this “less is more” shit. I took 2mg after taking 8mg for about 4 days, went to my first meeting and fucking nodded out thru the whole thing. I was so embarrassed, but I really had no idea I could get those kind of effects from 2mg of sub (??).  If I could be fine on 2-4mg I’d be able to save at least a full dose every day, which sounds awesome obviously. 

So I guess that’s the one other question, can I/how can I get a buzz off of my subs themselves, while being on sub maintenance? Like today, I’m having really bad cravings and going through some unique emotional shit I won’t have to deal with so acutely later. I was thinking of crushing up half of another tablet and railing and/or boofing some. Would that give me a buzz like taking sub when I’m clean clean? 🤔 ? Or is there a ceiling/blocking effect at play that would make that a waste? Guess it’s worth one tab to find out. I don’t think they even really mind if I use a couple extra, they scheduled my appt slightly early “in case I run out early”. They’re actually really chill, they told me explicitly that it’s okay that I’m gonna piss dirty for cannabis every time. How about if I get down to 4 or even say 2mg/day - would I be able to double THAT dose and get high?

TLDR; how long should I wait after daily 8mg dose to get normalish effects from normalish dose of dope/fent? If I get some fent and don’t wait at all I can break through if I do enough, right? (I’ve OD’d before btw, spare me) Also wondering if it’s a waste to try to rail/boot an extra 4-8mg or something like that.",1516404005.0

I actually get half the normal dosage (192 mg) so mine is a bit weaker than most.  This time, however, it is optimal for my usage to be earlier than normal in the cycle (I am currently on day 17, before I have only used when I was absolutely sure the blockade was gone).  I am being very careful with my dosage (IV heroin from the onions) but I am not sure if I am using too little, the blockade is still in effect, or a combination of both.


For those that have used on the early tail end of vivitrol, what exactly does it feel like?  Do you still get a taste even if the high is blocked or reduced (I don't even get a taste)?  Do your pupils pin, etc.?  Be specific about what symptoms you have and do not have compared to normal.


I also am interested in if anyone has ways to gauge how much blockade is left by how ""reduced"" the effects are.  ",1516397280.0

I want to be extra precautions to avoid PWDs. 

Here's a quick rundown of the last 24 hours: My last shot was at 7 pm last night. I had to write a report that night so I took ~20 mg (at 8 pm) of meth to stay up and be productive. I stayed up until 5:30 at took 1.0mg clonazepam and 2 mg of lorazepam to fall asleep (I was starting to feel a little shitty the nut I didn't know for sure it was withdrawals). 

12pm
I woke up feeling rough, nothing too serious just lethargy, slightly aching bones and I was freezing cold despite the room being set to room temp. I had to go to work so I took 25 mg of meth to fight back the lethargy. 

Since I've gotten to work, temperature fluctuation have become noticeable and I've started dry heaving and having some stomach cramps. I've thrown up like 3 times but other than that I don't know what to think. The symptoms I just describe are the only ones I've got. 

I'm thinking the meth is overrding the other aspects. Still. I'm wary to take the sub.

I had surgery about 6 months ago, and with that came prescribed DHC. 30mg tabs no apap, scripted roughly 240-320mg daily prescribed. I received what I think was IV didaliud(sp) before the op, and was given a whack think oxy10 a few hours previous to calm me as I had to wait a few hours in the hospital bed.

After the surgery those DHC got me LIT as fuck for a few days after having absolutely zero tolerance - as in never before consumed any opiates previously. But the high noticeably diminished as the weeks went on, and I started taking about 500-600mg a day.

I've always been interested in drugs, but truthfully thought opiates were just for junkies. Heck, I didn't really know DHC was an opiate! I researched for weeks about opiates, eventually landing here.

There is so much good information here, friendly mods and most of all love. The way everyone cheers each other on and comforts them in bad types is beautiful. 

I'm sorry your loss has been my gain in some ways. All the bad things that have happened to some of you, most of you. I have learned from all of your mistakes, I will never recreationally abuse opiates again, I will never climb that tolerance ladder looking for my next high. I will use them if I absolutely need to post surgery.

I love you all, thank you.",1516393718.0

I'm going to run out before this month's refill. That means awful Opana WD and possibly having issues with the clinic I go to. Dad and I live several states apart but have never lost a bit of our closeness. We speak on the phone frequently. It's good to have someone who knows EXACTLY what you're going through with chronic pain, especially when it's close family. I finally broke down on the phone and told him what's going on (not quite the full extent; he doesn't need to know I'm already in WD. Knowing my Dad he could tell just by the way I sounded, though).

What does my awesome Dad do?

Immediately offer to get 12 in the mail to me Friday night before the post office closes so I will have them by Monday. I'll be mailing some of mine back up to him so he won't miss his pill count and he'll be saving me from the special hell that is WD. I was bawling my eyes out on the phone thanking him, telling him ""you don't have to do this, I've gone through WD before, I don't want to fuck up your pill count"" and his only response was ""I love you, and I'm your Dad, I'm not going to let you hurt if I can help it.... now please let me get off the phone so I can get these to you"".

So now I'm just waiting for the mail to get here on Monday. I'm learning that WD is easier to handle when you know you'e got something coming to you. I feel much more relaxed and much more able to internalize the idea that this feeling isn't going to last forever (or even a full 10 days like my WD usually do). He'll never see it but thanks for the rescue Dad. I owe you one. <3

The difference is startling. I know ideally I would like to measure opiate users rather than population but it was not possible. Regardless the difference is phenomenal. 

I dont know if its because we have no culture of oxy type drugs, fent is rare here, naloxone is freely available to addicts, methadone is free to any opiate addict and there is a range of harm reduction services free of charge. The difference is frightening though.",1516546435.0

I was thinking maybe about 12-24 hours from now and how should I divy out the other meds?

I remember this fling I had with this chicky that I was feeding coke and my two friends made me feel what CEO'S or what someone elected into a powerful position would feel. It's an easy way to find something you can control over when your life is shit.

Even being a shitty middleman gives you that control and upper hand it's a dog eat dog world and the way to the top is ruthless. How submissive you will be or how willing you are to get to the top is what drives many to do the most disgusting things.

Their is no chain of command. You are your own boss. Even drug dealers, I'd rather cold cop than have someone tell me where to go, I'll get it on my own time and the thrill of that is alluring.

What I am is saying that right now I'm a mess and when I can't control my life having control over people does it for you sometimes.",1516518437.0
7rwblm,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7rwblm/5_more_days/,15,https://redd.it/7rwblm,JustWeightOnIt,5 more days,"I’ve been on probation for over 3 years. While I’ve used throughout that time this last year i had to really cut back. the first 2 years while it was only felony Probation so they didn’t really drug test all that much. The only reason i went back to jail was on me. It was because I got arrested for a failure to maintain lane that resulted in a wreck. I had 2 seizures from benzo WD so I got kicked out of jail. Did a little over a month (3 for 1 since I was a trustee) for that. 

Anyways the last year I was on misdemeanor and in my county those people don’t fuck around. Drug tests started at twice a month. Well I failed the first one for xanax (rx’d), pot, and alcohol. They saw my script for the xanax and let that slide but they still wanted to lock me back up for the pot and booze. I ended up running away to rehab for 3 months and the judge let me off with a warning. Then I missed a test on accident (I just forgot to call in) and he bumped my testing up to once a week.

About a couple months ago they found oxy in my system. That’s because the original tests they used looked for “opiates” which really meant anything that breaks down in to morphine. I figured that out before they did and kept using until the pulled the old switcheroo without telling me. She (my PO) called me and told me she was gonna revoke the rest of my time (like 6 months). I was freaking out until I got my prescription list from my pharmacy and saw I had a script of oxy 5s from a wisdom tooth extraction a year prior to all this. I told her I had oxys for an ongoing pain that I needed surgery to fix but since I was in school i didn’t have the time. She fucking believed me! 

So I continued to pop oxys a handful of times the last couple months. I did do some speedballs a couple months back but that was once the day after a drug test so I knew I would Be clean the next test because they reduced the amount to twice a month. 

So that brings me to today, 5 days away from being put on non report (no testing, no monthly meetings, NO MORE PAYMENTS — $50 per meeting and $35 for each drug test) and guys/girls I couldn’t be happier. I’ll probably cut back on the oxy consumption and pick up some high quality Mary Jane and some extracts(my girlfriend just bought a $4000 piece to smoke from and I still have my mothership) I might have a couple beers as well to top it all off. I’m so glad I don’t have to rely on oxys to get a buzz when I want.

You can do it if you are scared of the consequences or know how to work the system. ",1516518083.0

the real risk people are overlooking is hitting your head if you fall down - i have done that multiple times as well as down the staircase twice, in a classroom once, and twice while i was driving where i wrecked into guardrails on the interstate going 50-60 mph. both times i hit the windshield with my head and cracked it as well as concussing myself unconcicous. i would of defiinitely died and went thru the windshield had i not worn a seatbelt but i always do wear one thank god.

so yea i think i should be dead but im still here and i wonder why a lot of the time and it depresses me for some reason.  i was a very bright person but these concussions and seizures have definitely fucked my cognition up a lot.  i feel like i have super ADHD and even dyslexia",1516516379.0
7rw6ig,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7rw6ig/how_can_i_be_kind_without_being_stupid/,25,https://redd.it/7rw6ig,crookedlook,How can I be kind without being stupid?,"I live with my boyfriend. We have had a mutual understanding that if any of our friends were going through a hard time, we'd give them a place to crash and help them out. 

There's an old friend of the bf's, let's call him Bill. He used to do dope, but has been clean for a few years. Bill has had a rough time in life for the past three years. His long term gf left him, and ever since can't keep a place to live, even though he works as a bartender in a major city five nights a week. What few teeth he's got are not looking good. He's skinny and puffy faced. 

Bill told the bf that the apartment he'd been staying in was locked shut by the marshall because the person he'd been paying rent to had taken the money and skipped town. Bill is supposedly sleeping at the bar a few times a week after his shift. He sometimes shows up at 2am, or sometimes shows up at 10am and then goes up to the the attic space where we have a spare bed and crashes up there all day.

The second night he crashed here, he stayed up there for 15 hours. He came down to pee, I chatted with him briefly but he cut that short, saying he had to get going and try to get his stuff out of the apartment somehow. He went back up to the attic, and.... there was silence for the following hour and a half. Then he came back down and said he'd fallen back asleep. He went out, traveled over an hour all the way to his work to see if he was needed (instead of just calling?) and then came back two hours later.

A different night he left our apartment at 5am because he said he couldn't sleep, and didn't return for a day or two.

Bill came by two days ago and smelled like a homeless person. No exaggeration. It wasn't normal BO or staying in the same clothes for a few days. It was intense. It was the kind of smell that people get off the bus to avoid. I don't understand how he can even be allowed to work like that. I understand that he doesn't have access to his clothes and whatnot, but he can borrow something of my bf's, and we have a washing machine in my building. Or, fuck, why not clean your shit in the sink, even?!

Nothing about this guy doesn't scream full blown ""junkie"" to me. He doesn't hang out with the bf when he's here, he just goes up to the attic.  

For the past week and change he's been claiming that he's getting sick. Some kind of flu. 

I've spoken to my bf about my concerns, but he's firmly on the side of optimism. He could be sleeping a lot because of depression. He might be getting sick because he's sleeping at his work. 

Tonight Bill told me he kept waking up more and more sick. He's got a fever. I ordered us food, he said he'd like soup. When it arrived, he decided against eating and went back upstairs. 

I do not want to put my boyfriend in the position to have to throw his old friend out into the cold. If Bill is struggling with drugs, I would gladly let him stay here to kick, and support him as much as we can. I just had two very close people to me die of overdoses last summer. If I can help someone out of this hell, I will.

But if he's at the point where he can't keep a place to stay, is smelling like a homeless person, and is lying about his situation, that's a dangerous level of addiction to have in my home. I am poor, and can't afford to have anything of mine be hocked for drugs. I wouldn't even take it personally. Being a junkie is like having a demon possess you. He's not going to be in control of his better judgement.

Sorry this is a bit rambly.

What would you suggest as a not shitty way of dealing with this situation? What are some ways I could determine conclusively if drug use is the culprit? What is the best way to approach this? I have gone up to the attic and looked around once, but saw no blood or wax paper. The boyfriend said Bill would probably not shoot, though. There's no vomiting thus far, either. 

I just... I know what it is to feel utterly alone and abandoned, and I don't want Bill to feel that way. But I also don't want to end up in a bad situation.

TLDR; I think I have a junkie crashing with me. He's an old friend of my boyfriend's. What do I do?
_______________

UPDATE: Ok, so now I have proof he's using, as I just went up to the attic to shut off the lights, looked around, and found the orange cap to a hypo. My boyfriend is at work until after midnight, and Bill is supposedly coming back here in the near future, but who knows? fuck.",1516515952.0

She got outta rehab 8 months or so ago after ODing several times, then going to jail( for something theft related,not ODing)  The reason I bring up the ODing is because I fucking hate it. And the state I live in is bad, like if you are with someone and they OD prepare to go to jail.  If they die god forbid, prepare TO BE FUCKED. Anyway, she got herself hooked again, but she has no car and lives in bumfuck. I have a couple times taken her to get dope, but I really don't like doing it cus she is scary, mixing xanax or just doing too much on a low tolerance.  

Right now she is dope sick,had to call into work. I know how it is and it sucks. She is low key begging me to go pick her up ( 1 hour away) take her to get dope ( another hour back and then another hour back to my house)  She doesn't want to miss anymore work or be sick. I understand , but I just really don't feel like doing it. Not only for the time it takes,but like I said above she is scary.

Would you do it? ",1516493411.0

I’ve spent the last week on a little oxycodone bender. Had some ancient 5mgs on hand from a surgery, and boredom with my sobriety got the best of me.

I know, FIVE MILLIGRAMS. I even cut em in half most of the time. But I’m very small (5’ and 100lb) and haven’t had any chemical fun, not even a drink, in several months. For the last 6 days, I’ve had between 10-20mg every day, spaced out enough to feel just a bit happier and lighter between waking and bedtime. It was fun!

Today, all day, I’ve had what feels almost exactly like a particularly nasty booze hangover. Stupid, anxious, lethargic, etc.

My question is how long you think this will last? All the info I’m finding online regards higher doses and/or longer-term use, so I’m hoping an expert in here will be able to tell me I’ll be ok come Monday? Would a little tapering help, or just drag this out?

Thanks guys!

So me and my SO do blues occasionally. Actually, we occasionally take breaks from blues. I make good money, so she doesn't have to work. She worked when we first met, and my life was worse than it is now, and it allowed me to get a somewhat grip on things. I buy my blues from IRL sources. My SO and her brother really like weed, i stopped smoking years ago. Since the darknet offers a better selection and price to the weed thats around, i tend to get it from there for her and her brother, along with other drugs that people request from time to time. I will sometimes get samples of opiates that i havent had or havent had in a long time. A few weeks ago i got some BTH and smoked it. It was okay. Then i got .2 of some ECP the other day. Normally i can bang two blues at once and it gets me level (add another two and im probably nodding), but this .2 had me level all day. I couldn't get too high, as we were supposed to be on a break from using blues. A day or two later i order a gram. It comes from only a state away. Im sitting here waiting for the postman to come to deliver my package. I last used suboxone last night, so im going on over 12 hours from last dosage, as of right now. I tell people i know about this stuff, and they are amazed. I should be making a killing with this stuff.

Not sure where i was going with this. I guess im just killing time before the postman comes.

I can't be the only one","To make a long story short, I started suffering chronic migraines around the spring of 2016. I saw a neurologist who threw a bunch of pills at me over the summer. I didn't get much relief, so out of frustration I turned to pills. In the winter of 2016, I discovered kratom. By the summer of '17, I was taking at least 60 grams of it per day.

Due to various circumstances I could no longer afford it, so I stopped cold turkey. That's when I was hit with the worst headache of my life, far worse than any migraine I ever had. The worst part was, it never went away. I could go on and on about the soul-crushing, all-consuming pain, about how I didn't eat or sleep or days, but the short version is, I was hospitalized for trying to end my life.

Fast forward a bit and I managed to survive long enough to be placed on 12 mg/day of suboxone. It was great for about two weeks, then wouldn't you know, another transcendently painful, multi-day headache. I survived by taking multiple strips and being placed on a seizure medication that took the edge off.

This process repeated about once every two weeks or so, till I finally decided to hell with all opiates, and quit suboxone cold turkey.

I've been off subs for almost three months. I've had a chronic headache this whole time. My neuro knows about it and has thrown a few pills at me but nothing has worked out. I think he's desensitized to me honestly. It's different from a migraine, it's a very blunt pain that often encompasses my whole head with no nausea.

Am I the only one in the universe with a chronic headache like this? Is there anything else I can do. I can't imagine living the rest of my life in this much pain. I was hoping that as my tolerance went down and my brain healed the pain would get better, but there doesn't seem to be any end in sight. Would agmatine help at all? I still do have some tolerance, as I sampled some kratom last week and it took 9 grams to feel anything.",1516639829.0

I worked in a factory for a while with this guy we'll call T. Long story but we got fired at the same time for being a bit loud and obnoxious together.

T was a dirty looking guy, his teeth were like little yellow and black spikes - the ones that remained at least - and he generally stank. He mentioned he played guitar and I'd recently got obsessed with the guitar and figured I could learn something from him. He talked a big game, and told me about this 70s fender strat he had which was the only thing that had survived a previous house fire, how he had played in all these bands yadadda.

We grabbed about 12 cans of beer and walked to his house, about 20 minutes away. He listened to some good music and was decent at guitar (the strat in question was a fire damaged piece of pawn shop shit) but he made it sound alright.

We got pretty hammered and he broke out a little mirror/snorter/razor blade combo which he said was 'ether'. Now at this point I'm starting to assume this guy is a bit nuts, but fuck I obviously bash out a line and dust it off anyway. It was a weird, uncomfortable kind of high. I have no idea what that slightly grey powder was. It came on pretty hard though, and before you knew it we had decided we were going to go camping for 3 days in the local woods and began to pack. T had been in the military and had hoarded a bunch of camo, night vision goggles and gas-pellet rifles. We spent a bit of time running about his house dressed like soldiers with night vision goggles before things got dark. At some point between being shot at in the dark by a stranger and filling a bag with camping shit T brought through some LSD tabs - later turned out was 'P1LSd' -and we dropped two each.

T had a room mate called L. She was obviously transgender, and was very nice. I thought about trying to smash that later on in the night.

T began to get a bit delusional and described being part of military tours which pre-dated him by about 20 years, and made some pretty bold claims to venues he'd played at, but I shrugged it off because I was now ridiculously high and began questioning if his claims could really be true.

An hour or so passed of T rambling and pulling his socks off and putting them back on relentlessly before he stopped dead in his tracks, one sock on his foot, the other on his hand like a puppet and he stared me right in the eyes. ""Bigmuffblues, you know L she's a good girl, me and her are real close"". 

I got pretty paranoid, his death stare combined with his ice pick teeth were amplified and magnified to near giant proportions by the acid, and he spoke slowly and with intent for the first time in hours. I thought I had maybe been a bit flirty with his transgender roomie, who I could now see was basically his girlfriend. My anxiety caused me to spew out what I felt like was a 25 minute condensing lecture about how I'm cool with transgender people, and she wasn't his SO I was going to try my luck myself.

T shot to his feet immediately and began kicking anything over nearby. His guitar, half-full cans of beer, a small Bluetooth speaker. He was shouting so fast I had no idea what he was saying, and as I rose to my feet he picked up a bright orange m16 pellet gun and pointed it at my head. I sort of sniggered at him, so he shot me right between the eyes about 6 times.

He began shouting how L wasn't transgender and I needed to apologise. L had since run through and all 6 foot of her stood in the hallway shouting things like ""T it's okay he's just really high leave him alone!!"". At this point I am out of my fucking mind with intense rage, and I began to shout at the two of them somewhere along the lines of ""YOU CRAZY FUCKS, I DONT CARE IF YOU BOTH HAVE A DICK, YOU SHOOT ME AGAIN WITH THAT GUN ILL BURN THIS PLACE TO THE GROUND"". 

Now thankfully they believed I was as crazy as I made out because I for sure thought this dude was gonna kill me, but they moved out the way and let me walk out -bouncing off every wall on the way.

That was the end of the story for a long time, and I told it that way for many years until not so long go. A friend wanted to see this girl L so I looked her up. She's actually a very tall, good looking girl and is definitely not a transgender man.",1516634939.0

Two years ago my ex od'd and I got an ambulance there immediately and her life was spared. So they decided to take her to the hospital to make sure everything was ok. 
    There was no dope or needles or anything like that around so the cops were pissed and found a box of weed pipes under her couch and decided to take me straight to jail over it. It's seriously some bullshit. I paid a lawyer $1,000 and he got it reduced to a littering ticket instead of just getting it dropped. Fine whatever. I paid him and his job was done and all I had to do was pay the court $150 and it's all good. Well I missed the payment date and my lawyer decides to file a motion to withdraw from my case. He's got my 1,000 bucks and now I'm being charged with whole original charges which were possession of marijuana and paraphernalia even though there wasn't even any weed there. 
I'm just so pissed because I just got out of a 72 hour lockdown over it and now have to start the whole trial again. I'm gonna use a different lawyer this time and hopefully just get it dismissed. Its fucked because they even wrote in the report that I didn't live there and the box wasn't in plain sight either. How am I the one responsible for those pipes? There's not even proof I was using other then just being there I guess. 

TLDR: saved someone's life from an od in their own home and subsequently went to jail for their weed pipes.

Wd for two days until i could get the money. So i hit him up and he says he cant come to me an i could goto him. I dont have a car so i had to take the bus. So waiting at the bus stop i see a sub wrapper on the ground an pick it up. Of course it's empty. Bus was running late and i overhear this guy on the phone. He says you know anyone looking for subs. Fucking miracle is all i have to say. I immediately go up to him and ask how many he has an get his number. Says 7each or 10@5. It was exactly what i had in cash and it was long enough that i wouldnt get precipitated wd. It couldnt have gone any better. Shit worked out and im glad i couldnt get any d. Cant really say im clean but fuck it. I can honestly say i havent touched any other drugs besides bud in a month and thats all that matters. Ive always been hurting for money and had nothing. I have been using a old galaxy phone with a destroyed screen no back cover and battery was taped to it Now i already have a new laptop, xb1s, and a new phone. Crazy how much i blew on dope.  Just wanted to share this and hope you all the best.

So  I've been pretty fucking broke as of late. Not because of drugs, per se but life in general. Expensive family illnesses (plural) no hours at work, etc. I've taken up begging from time to time - not highway offramp with a sign sort of begging but asking folks at gas stations and other places in town.

I've undertaken this several times now, in various states of dress and with various stories - most bullshit and some 100% true and can tell you guys what worked and what didn't.

None of this should be a surprise to any of you but the better you dress the better the payout, or rather, the higher the frequency of payout. The worse you dress/appear the worse your returns will be, regardless of your story.

I usually use the gas storyline:

""Hey *really* sorry to bother you (look really, REALLY embarrassed and **super** uncomfortable) but I just called my wife and after calling me an idiot, (insert chuckle) told me that I left my wallet at home next to the front door on the little table and now I'm stuck here with no way to get home and I live about 25 minutes away. Do you *happen* to have a few bucks or enough for a gallon or two of gas I could borrow? I'm *extremely* uncomfortable asking like this but I really don't know what else to do.""

It's a pretty good patter, I think, but really misses as much as it hits in regard to actual cash. I've had people put $20 in my tank off of their card, one guy filled my tank entirely which was nice since I'm always out of gas anyway.

Generally I end up with $2-$5 after trolling for quite a while which sucks.

Today I put on black dress slacks, a Polo/Izod shirt with the first button buttoned, white t-shirt underneath and decent shoes.
I immediately felt like I was legitimate. Like, no matter what story I was about to tell was the *truth* because I looked and felt like someone legitimate.

Today's story was this: (I'm changing the career to protect my personal life)

""Hey boss/sir/man/buddy/hon I'm a Network Administrator/Computer guy that is in town working on a company's computer and the owner left for the day and forgot to pay me. The office assistant and I haven't been able to reach her/him for the last couple hours and I'm stuck in town without any gas and live way over in <some-ville>. Can you spare a few bucks so I can get back that way?""

**additional banter**
""I don't think it was intentional, I just think she forgot that she needed to be there when I finished the work.""

""The secretary and I had been trying to reach her for a good couple hours before she had to go home herself and now I'm just freaking stuck here.""

This last banter yielded me $25 in about an hour which was all I was looking for. It felt like an honest situation and the people I pitched it to seemed engaged in the story as well.

I basically dressed for the part. If you look like just an ""Office Joe""/Yuppie type, people are much more likely to feel a sense of camaraderie with you and empathy towards your situation.

My concern is having ""drug seeker"" on my record and possible legal issues if that is even possible.

The drug scene is ever so prevalent as has been as long as I can remember. I remember hearing my teachers in elementary discuss with coworkers about our town being a meth town and a heroin town. Show up to school and there's orange cones in the building taking up most of the hallway that has it's walls covered in sea animal paintings to put copper wire back in, because of those ""fuckin tweakers"". 

Alright, so then I knew. Drug addicts do things that have a very clear impact on the world outside of the drug scene and they blatantly don't give a singular fuck. Okay cool deal I can handle that, at least they're not hurting other people right? At least not as often as they're stripping copper? 

And even if they were going to hurt someone else, say someone else even in the drug scene, they'd do it nice and quick so they can go back out to the garden at 4 in the morning and cut slugs in half with scissors, right?

I'm beginning to see I'm very wrong. Very recently my homegirl was kidnapped. She was MIA for almost 4 days before I got to her. I had the location of the biggest city in the county over (big ass city, to my standard anyway) and 3 unrecognizable names to work with. She was on foot, phone broken, and in captivity. I played investigator for 2 straight days and got like 90% of the order of events down to the very hour, shortly after I went to the city and found her myself. I called the county police twice and they basically told me knock knock jokes over phone. This is the second time I've rescued her from a serious, legitimate, low odds of survival kidnapping in the last year. Both times she was beaten and bloodied. I got her home safe the night before last, yesterday she was arrested and sent to jail. So naturally I've been runnin around at night pulling moves with her older brother lately, who as I learned last night has also been kidnapped in the last 12 months, also near death experience. 

The people who kidnapped him live in a trap about 3 miles from where I stay, been in the house a handful of times. I semi-often pull moves with a kid who lives there, who also, as it turns out, has been beaten and kidnapped and gotten away as well. Last night I put all of this in front of me and just started hitting people up to see what kinda answers I would get. 

It's 10. You guys 10 different people that I actively see in my life have been kidnapped, almost killed and gotten away. The farthest back was 7 years ago. There are more people I'm going to try. I also know of some cases where the victim did not make it out alive, though these are few and far between. So my question is...

What in the rimjob loving fuck is going on here? Did I miss a town meeting or something? Did I not get that memo? Is that email in my spam folder? Because what the fuck. So now I'm asking you guys too. Is kidnapping a common thing in the drug scene you belong to?",1516731913.0

**H a different beast**

---

I tried heroin out of curiosity, just smoking it on foil, never tried a needle, 2.5g bag of brown H.

It feels amazing, it is cheap at first, you think you can control it. But the truth is, you will pay back for the pleasure it gives you, and pay back much more than you received.  

Once or twice a week became weekend speedball binges, which became daily binges or at least H when I ran out of the white stuff. One day, I binged too hard and slept for ~ 16 hours and woke up withdrawing.  

WD is hell. I'm a grown ass man and I was crying, no sobbing, in my smelly, sweat covered bed for 3 days (thank god I used for a short time, no longer than a month at a time), trying to find anything to get rid of this feeling.  

Thankfully, I realized I was going through WDs, and chose to stop taking H, even though I had a bit left, to detox myself to avoid leading to full-blown addiction.

---

Even after suffering through the ordeal, I thought I can handle this like I could handle all the other drugs I tried. I bought another 2.5g and tried to chip responsibly.  

**Boy was I wrong...**  

Little did I know, I was addicted to it already. I suffered through withdrawals after using another month, a couple days a week at first to daily use, to the point where I would smoke a bit of H, smoke a cigarette and immediately puke my guts out.  

 Thankfully, my second detox was just before Christmas when I had to go back home to an area where you really cant find drugs.  

After the second WD, that's when I realized that every time I try it, even just once, I would go into daily use within a week.  

---

**You may destroy your life like countless others.  
You may learn what it is like to WD, have depression and the point of view of a drug addict.  
All of this because of 5 grams of brown powder.**

---

Am I glad I tried it and got out in time with a rough spanking?  

To be honest, yes, I learned that 'junkies' are just people trapped by chemical dependency, not bad people.  

I learned that chemical pleasure is why we live this life, but also that naturally produced chemicals by means of exercise or living life to its fullest are so much more sustainable for long, happy, healthy life than the temporary pleasures that drugs provide.  

---

Anyone thinking of trying Heroin, know this. 

**You WILL love it, you WILL experience WD, it WILL be shitty, and you just MIGHT destroy your life in a matter of weeks**

It is only lucky circumstance that saved me from its clutches.  
It is nothing like any other drug I've tried.  

**Do not, under any circumstances underestimate it, because as soon as you do, she will make you her willing slave. Warm on the inside, but as cold as a rotting corpse on the outside.**

No i dont have back pain. No i didnt get it from a doctor, i got it from a dealer. Dont be afraid when i take a handful, i cant take just one baby, its called drug abuse for a reason..

I dont know. ..Are you sure you want to get high with me? This shit aint like weed. Itll knock you back and put you on your feet. Leave you grinding your teeth. And sweatin when theres no heat. Girl im a fuck up dont follow my lead.

If you miss one more class their going to drop you from your nursing program. Im not one to judge but, your tolerance is building quick. Last night you took more than me. You stole from your parents that you cherish,  to get high. When you saw me you didnt kiss me, you ran towards my stash. Your getting high everyday with me, girl im a fuck up , dont follow my lead.

Im sorry i have no cash. I cant support two habits. Only mine. Oxy is pricey. Relax stop screaming. Im sorry. Where are you going to go ? Your parents already kicked you out. Girl stay with me please..

This is the fourth time i have to pick you up from a guys house. And even though were not together anymore i still tuck you in my bed when your sprung out. I make you eat so you can hide your ribs. I told you not to play with trains because they leave tracks. I watch you sleep and dry the sweat off your head even though its winter. I hold you tight all night, because i know youll be gone again as soon as theres light.

You use to have such a beautiful way of speaking. So intellectual, and from the heart. Deep conversations and ideas. Now im seeing foam come from your mouth. Youve only been out of the hospital for three days and you want more? Girl please stop. I love you so much. I want you to be sober again. Youre taking too much. If you must get high, slow down, or else youll end up killing yourself. She said , ""its called drug abuse for a reason"".

i havent seen you in a year. I hope your okay. I hope you wear diamonds instead of smoking crystals. I hope the only reason why your using needles now is because you went back to school and became a nurse. I hope the only track marks you see are the ones on the road. I hope your hair grew its color, i hope your skins brighter. The last time i saw you i begged for you to come with me to rehab. I even went a month sober to influence you. I told you i hate looking at you like this. You told me then dont look. I told you i love you. You smiled and told me, ""boy im a fuck up dont follow my lead"".

But I got back and am trying to set up my old/customers and old/new plugs. 

Anyways, I got a new connect yesterday that has gunpowder for a great price (I'll get a pic when I get more). I've been sick all day so I was trying to figure something out whether it was middling, borrowing a few dollars, etc. I had a friend call around noon saying if he was able to grab something, he would stop by and help me out. Hours go by and his truck apparently ""broke down"" and couldn't make it. So I'm bummed at this point.

I message a few more people and someone said they would get a little because I needed help. YES! Turns out, she was helping 2 people with this dope. Not only was she getting me well, but a friend of hers had a really bad day due to her boyfriend beating her and then going to jail. So she was stuck outside with her cat & dog dopesick. And the only way my friend would get her to agree to come with her was to get the dope. 

So, she comes and picks me up and my dude doesn't answer....shit. my main guy and his girl live like 2 blocks away from the new guy. So I call the girl and she's waiting for her bf to get home to grab bth because she only has china which my friend doesn't want (smoker). Says she will call as soon as he gets there to meet us. I'm thinking ""fuck, now I'm not gonna get well and I'm gonna get dropped off"".

So we wait while I'm trying to get a hold of my new guy. The girl ends up calling RIGHT WHEN my friend wants to leave. YES!!! 

So she meets us and I get the dope for my friend (BTH). She happened to be cooking up a speedball when I got in the car. This whole time I'm thinking I'll be able to hit t he foil a couple times and that's it (I shoot). I asked her if I could grab a bit of the china to get well (we're actual childhood friends) and she says sure so I grab it from her purse and open it. She says ""hold on"". She had sucked up her 70-80 units and gives me about 30! 

FUCK YES FOR FRIENDS THAT SELL!!!! 

I end up getting a small bit from my friend as well for going with her to get her friend that had the domestic violence issue earlier today. 

Sorry for the long post, but it turned my day around completely. I just wanted to share my only JJ save.

I get no euphoria from the pills or any other positive effect other than pain relief. And that's all I'm looking for here. 

I find myself having come up short on both prescriptions by about a week because of my own stupidity and irresponsibility. If it's being stupid to try to actually fix my f**king pain. My doctor won't prescribe any higher dosage and won't give me any pills early. 

So I'm trying to figure out how to get through the next week without just dying from the pain (and withdrawal). I have some 25 mcg fentanyl patches and might be able to get some 100s. How much, roughly, do you think I'd need to just barely get through a day? Like 150 mcg of fentanyl? More? 

And should I go buy some heroin off the street? I've never done it before, I don't know where to go or what to say to the dealer, or even how much I need. 

ANY help, please, anything at all, is MOST appreciated. I'm utterly desperate. I've put myself in an extremely dire situation, and now I need to know how to figure out how to get through these next 7 days without killing myself from the pain (I won't, really. But it's going to be absolute hell). 

So - how much fentanyl do I need, and should I eat the gel (which I prefer) or smoke it? The actual patch just doesn't work for me, I need a faster and bigger release. 

And should I bother trying to get the fentanyl when I could just go somewhere in my town and buy some heroin? I have money, I can buy what I need, but I'm extremely afraid of getting caught and being put in jail without the drugs I need! Thinking about staying overnight or whatever with nothing - that's truly, truly hell. 

If you've read all this, god bless you. If you have any advice on ANY of these questions, god bless you again!!! I'm desperate for any solution here, please let me know what you think!!",1516692429.0

Its not that all of a sudden we have the key to open the lock of getting high as we want and having enough supply for free. No that has nothing to do with it at all. But PERCEPTION is a dangerous double edged sword. In my eyes when I was a strung out addict not even connected enough to buy enough good drugs to get strung out, I thought anybody with a Oxy script or better had it made. I couldnt walk into a grocery store while waiting or in slight withdrawl because id walk arouind fantasizing about how every thing I want and need is right behind that counter and how easy it would be to pull off a u know wat. So going to get snacks on a decent night turns into brain obsessing over how much better id feel on opiates. See I wasnt even in withdrawl but the mental withdrwal is hell too. I used t o look at my m doan guy as a lucky guy getting 6 takehomes for freeeee of 210 mgs. So then when you gett ontomat yourself everything about everything changes. Now like I said your not getting a key to unlock the mystery of getting high and being able to do it when ever you want and there are no ill consequences. FOrget that. But now I can walk into a grocery store and smile about my past dilemma. Now I can look at my old shitbox dealer and laugh about how shitty his life is when b4 I always thought man hes lucky hes always at least got somthing for himself and gets shit for free cause he middles and slangs. But because I can think clearly Now I say man his life is a trap/nightmare. Dont get me wrong id love to be able to feel the trill of wanting somthing and going thru a process to get it. but thats invlolves super highs and lows. for example the low of knowing its been over 2 hrs since your dealer said they would stop by and take care of u, but you know if you call them they might freak out and not stop by because somthing prolly happend to get them held up so me calling a few times to see where my dope is at is irrelievent to the problems that caused him to be two hrs late. so u sit there nodding and shaking your head to yourself. back and forth. yea hes coming by for sure just realx. then u finally decide to call him and he says or wats up why havent u called i figured u were taken care of. welll i figured u said ud be here @ 4 so i didnt want to bother u. OH dam man sounds like we miscommunicated ..No problem man can u stop by right now. No Im on my way to dinner with my gf and were going out tonite but ill hook u up fat tommorw. U SEE GETTING ON METHADONE ISNT SO THAT I CAN GET HIGH. ITS SO I NEVER HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE INSANE WORLD WHCIH IS THE UNDERGROUND BLACK MARKET DRUG SCENE. Now some people think that they have it made cause they know so and so and that just because its hard for most junkies that they work FT and have savings and dont have to deal with anyone else. just an old time buddy who is high up and takes care of me because we go way back. Even that sitution which seems like a pretty good sitution for the friend who works FT but then bammmmmmmmmmmm his buddy catches a charge or getts robbed or gets in a car acct ect. and then all of a sudden the nice aspect of not having to deal with anybody and having such a great situation is gone in the blink of an eye. Now u can see where this is going its either detox time or dr shopping, cold copping, craigslist, , ect.. enough to make your head explode after what you had b4. Now your sitting there on the verge of doing things that one month ago while sitting in your bed with your normal pick up youd think were barbaic. for junkies and people who choose to be sick and homless because they choose drugs over life. Do u see where im going with this. There are amazing stories of how mat treatment has given back there perception on life. without being fogged over",1516670610.0

What do I say to my soon to be former running partner?,"I'm not quite there yet. I'm getting my photo ID registered this week right after pay day and going in person to register for insurance. I figure by the time I get my ID in the mail, the insurance will be active and I'll be able to get a real prescription for Suboxone.




I still plan to procure dope one last time this week. I'm owed half a bun from Cliff and it ain't coming my way until Friday script day becasue he had to spend all of his money to pay his elecrtic bill after the power got turned off this morning. Which I believe, because it happens a few times a year. I'm planning to buy dope one last time this week, some of it will get loaned to Cliff until script day.


From there I can either count the script as part of my last hurrah or I can trade it with someone else. TBH, I'll inevitably consume the roxies. By that time I'll still have one and a half (12mg total) subs on hand to ensure I don't get sick when I run out. This will also to ensure that I don't feel compelled to buy more dope for lack of subs.

&nbsp;


I'll attempt to get more subs on the street but this pay check is part of the grander plan.


**Phase 1:** Pay fee and register for photo ID at DMV on Friday. Then go to health insurer in person (yeah they have a spot) and try to register for that while waiting for ID to come in the mail.



**Phase 2:** If the insurance is active before I get my photo ID, I'll schedule an appointment with a doctor to get a prescription for subs.


**Phase 3:** Use my new photo ID to pick up my Suboxone script from a real pharmacy.


If my insurance isn't active by my next pay day over two weeks from now, then I'll just spend cold hard cash on the doctor and on the Suboxone script. I'll get a manufacturers coupon to help. By then I'll have my photo ID which is the only major obstacle to gettng subs legally aside from the cost.


Basically, this week should be the last time I buy subs on the street.

&nbsp;


**Now to the question:**

If I ghost on Cliff, he'll eventually begin to persistently try to get in touch with me. He might start with phone calls and texts to my mobile but it won't end there if I don't respond for a couple of days. Early on he'll call my house phone but then he'll ultimately come knocking. 


**When I'm ready to kick because I have a script for subs, I need to tell Cliff something to prevent him from knocking on my front door.**


**What should I say?**

&nbsp;

I ask because I forsee some possible issues. If I say, ""I started seeing a doctor and was prescribed subs."" He'll want me to share some. A couple of months ago when I said I was planning to see a doctor because I Was tired of all the bullshit (spending all of my money on pay day, getting sick because his promises lapsed) he asked me in a worried tone, well practically asserted in a worried tone, ""you are going to share some of those subs when you get them, right?"" 


So you see, if I say that I have a script, he's gonna expect a piece of the action. If the insurance covers the entire cost, I wold still pretend that they cost me a fortune so that I can't be accused of being grimey by not sharing. 

&nbsp;

Perhaps once I have the script locked down I can just honestly tell him, ""I'm out of the game for good and can't share my script because the doctor tests my urine for bupe levels."" I currently cannot predict the outcome of this strategy but I don't think it'll be good if I tell him that I have a script for 30 8mg subs for the month. He knows I never take a full 8mg in any given day. He'll probably say ""I've always shared my roxy srcipt"" but the two free roxies I've recieved every month are payment for me biking to the pharmacy to pick them up. I earned that. Everything else costs me something. 


Maybe I woldn't mind sharing a few subs but I really don't want to set a precedent.

&nbsp;

Some of you have seen me on here 99% of you have not. I've been using opiates for almost 5 years on an off usually going on short binges and my longest being a year. I've been clean for 3 or 4 months as far as using daily goes but I use again one time every 2 weeks so I don't go crazy and use Kratom in between that. Friday and Saturday I used and used quite a bit over those 2 days but then I got back on my Kratom taking a higher dose to compensate for any tolerance I gained. Yesterday I was fine but today I feel really sick even with my Kratom. But not like dope sick just like the nausea and diarrhea part of it. And it's like I'm pissing out of my ass for a good 10 seconds at a time. I'm not dehydrated I drink over a gallon of water a day so I have no idea what's wrong. Usually when I do my doses I do it for one day. Could this be the effect of doing a shit ton of my DOC in 2 days rather than 1?or am I just sick from something else. And it can't be food poisoning because I'm fasting right now and haven't eaten since Saturday morning ,1516656334.0

So I got 80mg OxyContin pill, I split it into 4 parts and swallowed one of them (~20mg) and 1h + 20mins later not feeling any effects. Maybe a little euphoria.

Am I fine if I try with 40mg tomorrow? This shit was expensive af, kinda waste money

btw this is my first time doing opiates",1516655627.0

Been on buprenorphine for the past year, very slowly decreasing my dose. Gone from 4mg to 2mg.

Essentially the side effects are getting to me. Ass shredding constipation, drowsiness, that awful numbness with none of the enjoyment of my past use. Just kinda sick of being addicted tbh. But it was always going to be a long term thing, jumping off completely would pbb be a bad idea, especially at such a relatively high dose. I'm hoping that dropping from 2 to 1mg will help with the annoying effects, give me some sense of control and renew my desire to get off of the stuff, even if I go back to slowly reducing but from 1mg rather than 2.

How long do you think it will take my body to adjust to a new lower dose? I'm guessing weeks rather than days... Could anyone who has done this in my situation tell me how bad it might be? Or am I worrying too much about something that'll be mostly painless?

I'm not too worried about any relapse, I'm confident that I'm over it, for now at least. Maybe I'm being overconfident but I feel sick of opiates in general given my recent feelings about my buprenorphine habit.

Thanks",1516650857.0
