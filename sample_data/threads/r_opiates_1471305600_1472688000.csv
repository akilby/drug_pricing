I've got a journal full of stupid shit waiting to be published on the Internet! Well I present to you the story of the kidnapping crazy fuck:
One of the worst plugs to grace our beautiful city was this crazy bug eyed 40 year old man. He seemed like a nice guy (apart from his appearance) and I'm a trusting guy  (maybe too much). Well one night my Dboy friend (Hoodie McPlug is what we'll call him. I should make comics about us lmao) and a couple that we were good friends with hopped in my car and told me to drive to this address. I'd been to this part of town many times, but nothing looked so Jank in all of my experiences. This neighborhood was as bad as it got in my city. Well this crazy guy was a plug and Hoodie McPlug needed to reup. We get to this guy's house and he let's us in. We go to the basement and instantly I know somethings off about this dude. Black bars lined the entire basement. Every window was covered. Maybe  he got robbed and made some adjustments idk. Well we got our dope and we're about to head out when he invited us to stay the night. Hoodie said we might as well. We were 1 hour away from our pad and it was 3 am. He set us up in the basement and closed the door on us. Knowing Hoodie I knew he would have a pistol and bowie knife (i told you he didnt fuck around :))with him at all times so I felt relatively safe. That night the 4 of us slept on 3 beds right next to each other. Hoodie was holding his 9 mil and his bowie knife while sleeping. I remember thinking ""no fucking way am I waking him up tomorrow"". Well the morning came and we woke up and prepared everything and headed for the door. Little did we know it was fucking locked! So Hoodie kicks that shit in and from upstairs we hear screaming and then this guy comes at us with a fucking baseball bat and and a switchblade (he chose some stupid fucking weapons tbh, crazy old fuck). Hoodie pulls his gun on him and he backs off. We booked it for my car. We're leaving when he comes out with a fucking chainsaw and starts chasing after the car. Needless to say that was the last interaction with that dude we ever had. I think he's in prison on 4 counts of kidnapping. I'm not quite sure, but he was a winner if I'd ever seen one lmao.


Tl;dr : crazy tweaker plug tried to kidnap us in the basement. Came swinging with a bat and got a gun pulled on him. Fuck this guy I'm never coming back again.",1471360178.0

**CONFIRMED FENTANYL AND BENZO CUT IN EASTERN PENNSYLVANIA/PHILLY AREA HEROIN.**

**Description:** *Blue wax bags double sealed with clear jewlery bag. Either Ziploc style or heat sealed. ""Acura"" and the car logo in black ink. The other one was ""Pitbull"" with a dog silhouette. Philly type bags, long and normal or skinny sized. Not the wide wax glassenine bags like in Newark.*

**Confirmed Stamp(s):** *""Acura"" car logo stamp. And the other confirmed stamp is ""Pitbull"" with a dog silhouette on it.*

*Any bags in this fashion (double sealed) should be approached with caution.*

*If you have information that is* **CONFIRMED**, *not just anecdotal and live in the area I'll add to the thread. Anything experience or anecdotal wise put in comments.*


--------------------

Heroin here is cut with Fentanyl and benzos. Drug test confirmed it and friend whos an employee at Quest Diagnostics confirmed another sample.


These bags are in the Philly region and surrounding areas. (Bucks, Lehigh, Montgomery Counties)

Bags are usually in a blue wax stamped bag double sealed in a jewelry bag.

Stamps Ive confirmed are Acura and Pitbull stamps.


I don't use anymore but had proof and tested more for my buddy who OD'd. Just be careful.

**EDIT:** The dope is cut with Fentanyl, it isn't pure Fentanyl. There is heroin, real heroin in it. Explains why my friend didn't get sick for close to 24 hours.

So looks or taste will not work. The taste will overpower the tiny amount of Fentanyl.",1471359092.0

The problem is, in my country it is damned difficult to get in to MMT or Suboxone treatment.

The rules vary by the city, but the basic requirements are:

-At least 2 years of proven record of opiate addiction. Sometimes they take your word for it, sometimes you have to show records of doctors visits, rehab attempts, piss tests etc.

-A rehab visit for which you have to wait for months and only if you fail you will be considered.

-Doctors and social workers will evaluate whether you are suitable for maintenance therapy, this can take up to 6 months or even longer.

Is it easier where you live? Like pay for the treatment and walk in?

I'm seriously considering changing the country if I decide for MMT in the future. Meantime I guess I will start my path of going to rehab and failing it on purpose just so I can get consider for treatment when I need it.

So people of /r/opiates, what is doing drugs like for you? To explain the question (since it's not very clear), I don't mean ""describe your oxy use"" or ""give me a trip report"". What does doing drugs do for you? Does it fill voids in your life? Does it stop some physical pain? Does it stop some emotional pain? Does that needle replace your mother's arms? Are those pills her warmth? Are things not so dark and dramatic? Does that double cup signify a good time? Does your foil mean you've made it? Also, as always, why? 

This may not be a straightforward one to answer, but I'm pretty interested in your answers. Don't be afraid to really share here, hopefully it'll spark some good discussion.

Don't relapse if ur clean, I dropped my dope habit and traded it for a IV Coke habit. Mannnn... 



DONT SHOOT COKE ! Either lol. 

No job 
No money
LOTS of sending from one venmo to another and withdraw lol, lots of bs.


I will add this, on July 4th my brother died in my arms from an dope OD, fent, he only did half a point. I did like .4 and was fine. It was weird he didn't start acting weird until 10 mins later, anyhow I called 911 the second I knew he was ODing.. As everyone should. 


So that's been fucking with me.

But I've been doing Coke and dope since  August last year, every day. Up until like 3 months ago, when I got my methadone dose to 100, since my last clinic limited me. 


The moral is if u used to be addicted guess what YOU STILL ARE !!! 

No you can't USE SMARTER, those who say that WILL eventually fuck up, they all do.


UF U CAN STAY CLEAN EVEN FOR 7 days that's awesome. Don't break long streaks. They make be awesome for about a week but after that they are shitty.

Well I must've spoken too soon because the next night I get a call saying ""that skinny fuck bounced in my xterra while I was sleeping."" I met up with dboy and we started a fucking manhunt. We went major street by major street until we get a call from dboys brother saying he's found him. In short order the 3 of us are right behind him running red lights and stop signs like it's the Indianapolis 500. Finally the junkie goes into a parking lot and tries to run. All 4 doors opened up and at least 6 junkies got out and split. Well we weren't going to let this junkie get away. Dboy skid his Harley into the xterra door closing it while the junkies legs were out of car. Dboy then pulls him out by his shoulders and the second the junkie hit the ground he balled up and started begging for his life. Being the merciful guy he was dboy just punched him once and said ""I can't kill a pussy."" I didn't blame him, in fact I felt horrible. After all it was me who vouched for him and that day I realized that you can't be nice and trusting with everyone. A formula that had done good for me up til then. We dropped off the junkie at a mcdonalds and left. The inside of dboys car was fucked. Blood and needles everywhere. Shit was torn up. I felt horrible, but my dboy said to me ""people make mistakes, you've always been a nice dude I hope this serves as a reminder that not everyone will appreciate you as much as I do."" I'll never forget those words. I love looking back on these memories now that I'm going to try to get clean. I always found it just so funny because I'm a skinny 6'4"" white kid studying pharmacology and I'm chilling with one of the most hood dealers I'd ever met. I guess opposites attract.

      My buddy calls me up and asks if I'm down to go out boosting one last time. We had a successful 4 month run. I knew I was about to move in 2-3 weeks. I thought this was a bad idea, but the thought of a nice fat shot was already implanted in my head. So being a junkie I said yeah fuck it lets go. So we head to Home Depot, and I go inside. Walk around fill my cart with a few things and throw my expensive 2 items I was gonna take off with in the front of my cart. I do this all very quickly and go by the register where there is a line. I Act as though I'm getting onto the line, and pickup my two expensive items and take off towards the door. Right as I get to the outside and I feel the sun on my face, I'm fucking tackled and there's 2 dudes already outfront waiting for me and they get on top of me. I try fighting them off me but to no avail. I'm a sick junkie trying to fight off 3 jacked security/lost prevention guys. 

Fucked. 

So now all these thoughts of regret are filling my head as I'm being walked through the store with cuffs on, all these customers looking at me in disgust. Damn.... Then I realize I have a needle in my pocket. Damn what else could go wrong.... So they bring me to the back room and start asking me all these questions. What's your name? Who were you with? Are you a drug addict? Why did you go for this specific item? Etc.... They say listen we gotta have the cops come. They probably won't take you to the precinct though they usually write a citation for you to goto court and let you go from here. But my dumbass left my wallet with I.d in my buddies car so they were deff bringing me down to the precinct. Anyway they bullshit with me and tell me the whole everyone makes a mistake man it's not the end of the world. Yea whatever you say boss. 

This whole time, I was slowly and quietly taking my needle out of my pocket and got it stashed under this plastic seat between the metal bars of the chair and the plastic. Cops show up. Take the cuffs from Home Depot off me and put their cuffs on. Ask for my I.d. And I tell em I didn't have it. Stand up lets go they say. Fuck me man. I stand up and start to walk and the Home Depot security gets up too and starts to walk behind me and accidentally the guy kicks the chair and my needle falls out from under it. FUCK. They all turn their heads and look at the syringe sitting right there. Fuck fuck fuck. Oh look what we have here the cop says and looks at me with fire in his eyes. Lol damn man can anything else go wrong? 

Nowhere to go from here but up, I guess lmao fml. So they book me at precinct and set 50$ bail luckily and my buddy comes through and bails me out so I didn't have to call my folks with another help me out I'm in jail bullshit calls. Being the junkie I am, the minute I get bailed out, I head to my dboys house and beg for a spot telling him what had happened and thankfully he hooked me up with a half gram. All my troubles went away till the next morning.

So now this is where I'm at, they gave me a court date for August 12th in NY which was 2 days ago and I'm in NC and had no way of going to that court date at all. 

Now my question is how long till they issue a bench warrant? Will New York come and get me if I run into the cops down here in NC? I know NC won't extradite someone but idk if NY will.  Is a petit larceny and a hypodermic needle charge important enough to NY to extradite me back there? How long will NC hold me in jail if they don't wanna come get me for it? And how fucked do you think I am in terms of jail time from NY if they do come and get me? I do have prior offenses. Just beat a possession charge like 3 months ago. And before that I have 2 dwi charges that I did 8 months for back in 2010. no felonies on record thankfully though. What do y'all think? Need some serious input here. 

I couldn't find any websites I could finding i had a warrant out for me yet. No free ones at least. Any help in somewhere I could look up my warrant situation at would be helpful as well. Thanks community for any input y'all have!",1471295313.0

So, I asked a friend to try and get some d, as I feel it will be cheaper and easier for me to taper with. He got some, but it's BTH, which I believe can only be shot or smoked.

So first question, is that correct? Second question, I've never shot anything and don't plan to start while I'm in the process of getting off of opiates, so if I do decide to get it I'll be smoking it. Will that be detrimental to me trying to get clean (not sure how the high compares to snorting in terms of being able to taper)? And if I do decide to smoke it, how do I know how much to smoke?

And a story,"My girl met this 60 year old black dude who fell in love with her. Its kinda become a sugar daddy type thing (no sex or anything, he just wants someone to spend time with) and he's become our main dopeman (or dopegrandparent). The first day they met he took her to our normal guy and bought us a 40 and when he seen the bag we got he said he could get better.

We are new to new Orleans but after only being here a few months we have gone through atleast ten different people (though only in one part of town) so I have a pretty good idea of what the area has to offer in terms of quality. We gauge quality on what we can get for $40, what we are used to in other areas if a 20 bag doesn't make you feel good then it aint worth buyin. Some guys do 4 dimes, some 2 20s, and here u can even get a half g of cut to shit shit for 40.

Anyways.

So a day or two after meeting the guy he calls and said I'm coming by I got something. He brings us a rock of the darkest Brown hardest most awesome shit. I haven't seen my girls eyes roll in the back of her head after a shot in a minute. He bought probably a ball of it and since he loves my girl he would just give us a 40 at a time every day (and he delivered,ASAP).

When that ball ran out he bought a quarter of some new stuff. This wasn't the dark brown but it was tan chunk and probably only 15% weaker than the dark stuff. The dude is not a dealer he just has good connections and buys for his ""people"" . We go through a quarter of that which brings us to the last week or so....

He has been copping this tan powder bullshit that even a quarter gram split between two of us there is no high just no sick. Its like when doing a suboxone your sickness disappears but no high. The cherry on top is I guess he figured he wasn't getting any from my girl and has not been just giving it to us he keeps a tally and we pay off the bill as we get paid.

So now that we have gotten all spoiled from free, top quality, delivery dope everyday we are now stuck with garbage we have to pay for and we have distanced ourselves from our other connects and due to being broke til payday Fri (and now we owe for the garbage) we are stuck all week with no prospect of feeling the shit, just getting off sick.

TLDR; new dude spoils us with the fire for free really...his connect drops off...starts charging us for shit that doesn't get us high

Good God,"So I have been on bupe for about 4 years and have IVd 2-8mg but usually 4mg daily.  I have never had to go more than 72 hrs before getting a refill during this whole periof and have never needed to go more than 60hrs tops before my script ran out.  My luck finally faded away this month..

Last Tues I got a g of fu-f, fpam, and nm2201.  I do not know how I did not OD but man what a godly combo that was.  I was let off work for the week and literally did not go  anywhere outside my room for 5 days straight.  I would IV or smoke the fu-f, smoke the nm, IV pg solution or orally dose fpam.  Literally all day every day I would wake up with my face on the floor having to remember to breathe and I've never been so content in my using history of 10 yrs.  I knew once I ran out I was fucked as I had traded away too many bupe for xans but I figured I had a couple days of wd at best.  Boy did I fuck up that timing..

I ran out of rcs on thurs.  I still could catch fu-f buzzes off the massive 50mg piles I was smoking off foil or light bulbs for maybe 24 hrs.  Then the sickness truly began.  Friday night presented me with the 2nd worst wd I had ever felt in my life - literally could not move an inch without dry heaving or shitting.  It was just barely milder than my worst kick ever early in my IV career which was a week long cold turkey off of 500mg IV morphine and 10mg xanax daily which nearly killed me due to dehydration.  For 24 hours straight all I could do was attempt to not move or even think how fucked I truly was as I hadn't dosed bupe in 4 days,a record, as the fu -f was more  than powerful to stave off bupe half life wd.  Then after 36 hours I slept for 20 min and woke up in even more agony.  Nothing left to shit or throw up.  I plugged a rinse of 30  bupe cottons and immediately felt everything melt away and had relief, though I knew it wouldn't last.  I felt great for 12 hours then noticed a sharp decline every hour.  That impending sense of doom and dread I had not felt in years started to envelop me.  Each hour got more dark and grim.  I soon became agitated and after 24 hrs shit reallllly got bad again.  That sense of doom got so dark.  Restless legs OUT OF THIS WORLD.  FUCK

I've had benzo seizures and wd and thought benzo wd took the cake but this is a different animal.  It is now Monday at 3pm.  Last bupe rinse of cotton was around 96 hours ago.  I have not slept since thursday.  My body aches so bad that walking five feet is truly hard.  I am wide awake but mentally exhausted.  I have been sitting in a humid garage in 95degree heat for an hour just to soothe my muscles and cold chills.  Hot water in the shower needs to reload after taking my 50th shower.

I have begun to get emotions back every hour or so bUT it's literally too hard to even feel them...it is too mentally draining to do anything bUT stare at the wall.  It has probably been 100 hrs since that bupe rinse and finally the sickness is stabling but my body aches so much.  I have not eaten more than one meal total over five days but I'm not hungry.

I just found out my sub doctor moved my Wednesday 4pm appt to tomorrow morning at 930.  Honestly knowing that I don't need to go more than 18 hours has been the biggest relief..I can't even cry that they moved it closer.  Did anybody read all this?  Will I survive the next 24 hours?  When people say bupe wd is long do they fucking mean it holy shit this experi3nce may be the one thing I needed most in my life.  I will commit suicide before going thru this again.

Edit- tldr I have been going thru a 4-5yr IV bupe 4-8mg habit and never went more than 48 hrs of wd.  In u days I have only plugged a rinse of bupe cotton and have never felt sickness like this.  Bupe wd is literally so long that every 24 hrs is a new circle of hell.  I've lost easily 10 lbs and have slept one night.  In 18 hrs I get my refill and life isn't real anymore.

I planned on doing a cwe to remove the tylenol but had a couple questions on how effective the process truly is ( I'm a paranoid motherfucker).

I was so tired, I didn't know if I could climb the 1 minute walk up the hill to my parents to borrow some 'food money'. So, I make a junkie coffee - basically, yeah, I'm an addict - I want EFFECTS, not fucking taste - so I POUR most of the coffee jar into a huge mug add some hot water (no milk, empty fridge, all food money goes on dope). I down it and set off, hoping to wake u a bit. I score some cash from my parents (I feel so bad, they think I'm okay right now) and head to my dealer. Sorted. I get home, prep a shot and as soon as it hits, something is wrong. Its the same dope as every day for the last month or so but suddenly the outside world begins to separate from my body. Time external to me is running at the wrong speed, about 20x normal. I look at my watch, its fine, everything I do is right speed, but all my senses tell me the universe is running so fast. Now, this wasn't a slight effect, it was terrifying. I've done shit tonnes of LSD, Shrooms, Ketamine, Ibogaine etc etc. hard trips.. and this was comparable. It lasted 45 mins to an hour and I could do nothing but pace about my tiny flat going out of my mind. It put me off dope for a couple of days until I remembered the coffee. I actually had to look up the effect on wikipedia and see if anyone else has suffered it. It's called 'derealisation' and its well documented. I never knew I could bring it on with that combination (vast amounts of caffeine and dope). But it happened. Look it up, its a fascinating and very weird effect, opiates are mentioned on the wiki page for derealisation, specifically in withdrawal though. So, warning to you - this drug combo is mental.

I have the opportunity to buy some opana and I'm struggling on whether it would be worth it over dope.  They're the global generics (G73) so 20mgs at $40 a pop.  From what I've seen this isn't a bad price for them, but it's not great either.  If I went that route, I'd probably scoop like 5 of them for $200.

Otherwise I can go the usual route and grab a g of solid h for anywhere from 130-160 and I'd still have some leftover cash compared to the opana.

What would you guys do? Last time I had opana was a couple years ago when I was first starting out so any opiate felt awesome, but I don't really remember it all that well.

but that is why I know it's my time to get clean. I've been using daily since approximately two weeks after I blew my very first bag. I thought I knew from the start what I was getting myself into... I was already addicted to opiates for years prior, and I had the enormous track record of just about every single pharmaceutical opioid to ever be prescribed on top of all the other pharms and recreational drugs I loved, so what was a little bump of some boy gonna do?

well, the answer to that is this: more than I ever could have fathomed. heroin put everything that I thought I knew about addiction and withdrawal to shame. just like it has for every single one of us. there's a reason for the tone we use when all respond to you kids asking how many pills you can safely pop without harming your stomachs and setting yourselves up for addiction... because the answer is zero. all it takes is one taste. one night. one high. to consume your entire life, your soul, and your entire being. no one is immune to addiction. no one is safe. not even you. not even me.

I'm continuing on using in order to feel ""normal,"" not even for the actual high itself anymore. I know I am capable of being (and feeling like) who I truly am without the security and comfort that opiates so simply provide. my love affair with opiates has been quite the long journey, but I can finally say I feel as if the boy is one I have outgrown; like I can finally admit that he no longer serves a purpose in my life as he is not furthering my growth in any way. in reality, he only hinders it, and that is all he has ever done. 

I have hit a new rock bottom recently and I am ashamed. I really fucked myself, the position I put myself in... however, I feel as if I've come to a crossroads and picked up the ability to let go of all those toxic lovers who no longer fit into my life. it's been a very long time since I've gotten to a point in my life where I feel like I'm no longer happily living for a high. and honestly, for a very long stretch of time, I felt as if that's precisely all I was doing on this earth. 

I really truly yearn from my very core, and with every fiber of my being, to not be addicted to heroin any longer. I have the willpower. I have thankfully, despite my bouts of depression and my addiction, never given up on the hobbies that I hold so close to my heart :) and that fact provides me with immense strength. I have so many things that I still find joy in doing, some that I've devoted countless hours of my life to! that simple fact is very empowering for me. I have my hoops, my writing, my impeccable taste in music, my box of lope and a great support system. I will fight this. to top it all off, I have a great man by my side who is thankfully on the same page I am, doing the same exact thing... fighting the same fight. wish us luck.

So here's the deal. I'm probably only going to say this here, a couple of years ago I was in a relationship with someone who had a heroin dependency. She would call or text telling me ""if I don't respond by x time it was bad"" She eventually died of a fentanyl overdose. We had an argument before and I was ignoring my phone at the time. Since then I've cleaned up my life and taught myself developing skills as a hobby to avoid idle hands. I know there are some opiate users here who have posted this idea for an app so if that's you, or if it's someone you know I'd really like for you to check it out and use it. It's free, if there's anyway I can improve it let me know. I'm not saying it's for drugs officially because I don't want to get thrown out of stores for it and there's so many uses since I developed it it can be used for but it's for you. I'm also releasing on IOS but there's some problems with apple and some of the features I'd like to use. Anyways here's onto the official description.

To tackle or deal with emergency situations, you cannot carry weapons all the time, but you can carry your smartphone. With increasing cases of thefts, rapes, other crimes or even accidents, it is important to have instant access to emergency services such as police helpline, ambulance, hospitals and more. Safety takes priority, so we have an app that takes care of your safety in the most convenient way. Distress Alarm- Emergency Alarm is among the best apps to deal with emergency or panic situations and to help you feel safe in emergency situations.

I worked as a nurse for 7 years prior to my life falling apart, well to an extent. I grew up in a high crime area, was heavily abused and have been in some precarious, but undoubtably interesting situations. I've been in the process of writing short anecdotal stories again to possibly make into a book. I also write scripts, poems etc. Anyways thought I'd share some stuff with you to gauge reception on my writing! let me know what you think, but please be nice :) I just started getting the strength to follow my passions again and get into writing and put down the D. Well try to at least, without further ado..


Back when I was 17, I had a friend, we'll call her Sandra. She had introduced me to coke that year, and she was a bit more a binger than I was to put it mildly. At 32 she was quite a bit older than me, and in hindsight I realize she was probably less interested in my high school drama stories and more interested in the coke I bought with my pizza delivery money. Which, side note, don't let your kids deliver pizza. Cash tips every day, its a total gateway job mmk guys. Anyways, I get a phone call at around 11 pm from Sandra. 

""Meet me at Saturn, I found an idiot to sell us a fucking quarter for 150! I'll suck his dick in the car to make me him happy just be there""

At this point in the story I'd like to point out that I have never engaged in dick-sucking for drug behavior, but I have engaged in dick sucking for money behavior. This was when I was a minor though and was solely for clothes and food. Anyways, I was down for the 150$ quarter. Before we get into a reddit war over prices 10 years ago, I really don't remember what the reasonable cost for a quarter of coke was back then so I just used what would be an absurdly cheap figure now. 

Saturn was one of those laughably dirty, cheap strip clubs that people only went to when they had less than 20$ in their pocket and wore dirty work boots. I'm pretty sure none of the strippers actively danced, they just showed up in sweat pants and ponytails soliciting hand jobs in the single stall bathroom. So at 17, it was obviously my favorite hangout considering I was a secret but dying to get out of the closet lesbian. 

""I'm in!"" I excitedly screamed into the phone. I picked out my favorite oversized white trash hoodie and off I went, to the whimsical planet in the galaxy of redneck strip bars. When I arrived I saw Sandra waiting at the front door for me in a sequin red dress that looked like it had been ripped off a dilapidated disco ball. I will never forget that dress, or the hair that was perched on the side of her head like a forgotten strip of road kill. ""Did you get the coke!?"" I asked, half expecting some excuse or bullshit story she would tell me to get me to put in cash. To my happy surprise, she opened her purse to reveal a fat sack of white, glorious nose candy. I won't even get into our 2 hours of watching fat, pregnant strippers parade around the club looking for free drinks like thirsty cattle, or our solemn swear to sell ALL of it and only spend half the money, because we all know where this is going. We blew it all, in one fucking night. So we will fast forward to the part where I witnessed my first overdose.

It's 6 a.m. We're both unreasonably wired and watching spongebob reruns. For some reason I am deeply depressed and displeased at the choice of television, so I glance over to see if she's paying attention to the remote. At first I thought she was still upset from the prior conversation she had with her boyfriend about an hour ago (him being concerned she does too much drugs of course..NO WAY!) then I noticed the truly blank stare in her eyes. The blood trickling down her nose and the lifeless arm propped up against the back of the couch. I run over to her and grab her face, she semi focuses on me but it feels like she's having small seizures. ""Sandra please!! Oh my fucking god how much did you do!!"" She continues to shake in my arms but no verbal response. I frantically rush over to the love seat I was sitting on and started searching for my sprint flip phone. I open it to call 911 and see my father has called 23 times. I dial the 9, he calls again. At this point I am both terrified of the beating I'm going to receive and terrified that my friend just died and I had no idea. I hold her head in my lap as she drools onto my bare leg, which surprisingly doesn't bother me at all. With all the bravery I could muster I answer the phone for my father and scream at him ""My fucking friend is dying please leave me the fuck alone"" and hung up. I slammed 911 into the keypad and finally was on the phone with a person I wanted to hear from. At this time she had begun to roll her head around a bit more but still not speaking, I hurriedly gave them the address and waited with her, holding her in my arms. She had recently lost her daughter, and I would be damned if she died alone if I could do anything about it. I told her everything was going to be ok and lay her head on a pillow while I cleaned up our drug den. Mirror, empty baggy, straw, check. Trashed. Later on when she would come to and we'd talk about this incident, she would thank me profusely. Friends, there to clean up your paraphernalia. It's the little things. They arrived remarkably fast, and I backed away while they worked on her. The EMT slipped the oxygen mask over her face and issued chest compressions. Everything that happened in the next few moments feels like a hazy blur, but I remember the reality of where I was and what time it was crashing over me like a sick wave that I would soon drown in. They asked me my name, who I was to her, if I wanted to go with them. I couldn't. I was just a 17 year old skipping high school to get high and avoid daily beatings by her father... and it was time to go home and face his wrath.

The Oxy did not seem to last as long as Hyrdo before I started getting the heebie jeebies for another pill.  

The euphoria on Oxy was not as good as on Hydro for me, but the hydro was not cutting pain management wise so I had to do something.  Now the Oxy isnt cutting it so they switched me to morphine for a month to see how it works.

Will there be any euphoria with Morphine?  What other non needle ingestion routes can I take to make it better?

I've been blessed by my P.O the option to go to rehab instead of jail so I'm going to rehab tomorrow and I'm hoping that I get the most out of this and can actually stay clean afterwards.
 
 Please be safe out there everyone, no one deserves to have their life ended early, or ruined because of our addictions. Its such a heavy burden to carry knowing you've let everyone you love down and have had them mad and dissapointed at you and cry because they can't imagine how selfish you are for almost killing yourself. I can't lecture anyone on here for using/stealing/cheating etc. but I really hope anyone early in there addiction or before there addiction tries to get help before you become in too deep 

  My 3 overdoses they have really fucked me and my family up mentally. The first one involved me overdosing outside an autozone while smoking a cigarette while my then 10 month old son was in my girlfriends car 15 feet away. This was from me snorting 2 points too, while I had a half gram a say habit at the least, and keep this in mind, I'm pretty overweight. Like 265 and 5'10 overweight. The second one came a month later and actually happened about 10 days ago. This time I snorted a point and a half and went out, and this one is the reason I almost violated probation, my girlfriend luckily called an ambulance and gave me CPR till they arrived this cop called my po immediately, who then called my Mom. So with this 2nd overdose I let down my mom, girlfriend, beat Friend who doesn't use, 2 brothers, an uncle an aunt, and my probation officer. It was hard having all these people break down and cry and beg you to stay clean and hear how important I am to them and how much of a bitch I am for being a greedy dope fiend trying to run from responsibilities and family and life.

  Now for the third and most recent overdose approximately 7 hours ago. Yeah I know like what the fuck am I doing using and overdosing when it happened last week? Well I'm a dumbass whom is a pussy when it comes too withdrawing so I just kept fucking using, plus I go to yt Just in littler doses and getting shit that wasn't even that good. But then today happens, and what a shitfest today was. Of course I wanted to get high for the last time and I almost made it the last shit ever guaranteed. Have this girl who we are friend's with have me buy her rigs, and break her off when we get shit since it's from her dude, which I'm cool with but when I give her .2 and she gets mad and keeps begging for more, when I know her dude gave her shit I get a little mad. Fast forward to 25 minutes later when I wake up again in the back of a fucking ambulance after snorting a sample .1 out of it to see how much I can do..... Go to the hospital and call my gf who's pissed as fuck for what just happened but even more mad cuz almost all of our shit is somehow gone and most of our cigs too. And too top it all off, she had me hold all her money to go from Maryland back to Ohio with is gone, which was about $315 which I had in my flannel pocket that the EMTs took off and the girl we gave the ride for grabbed and put in the car and my girl didn't know thats where i had the money. So long story short I discharge myself out the hospital, which the doctor threatened to call the cops on me for for some reason and search the car for her money, and we found my flannel and guess what? Moneys gone. My girl has a breakdown right then and there and right when im about to call this bitch and tell her she's gonna get fucked up we find her purse in the backseat.

All three of us made a glass of poppy seed tea. I was thinking that it wouldn't fuck me up that much, because I usually smoke tar so I thought I had a pretty high tolerance. So we all made a average glass and drank it. So we waited till it started to kick in but within a hour I was higher than normally, but I didn't really think any of it. So a couple of hours later my friend started to throw up a lot. So we were trying to make him feel better and make sure he was alright. A couple of hours later he said fuck it I am going to bed because I feel shitty. So me and my other friend were chilling downstairs watching Netflix but about a hour into the movie, I started to feel super shitty. So I was like fuck this I am going to bed to so I just laid on the couch and fell asleep. When I went to bed my friend that went to sleep early got up and was checking on us. He woke up my other friend up and then they were trying to wake me up. I wouldn't wake up, they pour water on me and slapped me, the only thing I did was making noise. After 30 mins they had to call a ambulance, and they had to narcan me. I don't remember anything intill we got to the hospital and I consciously woke up when we arrived at the hospital. I had no idea how I got there thou. They explained what happened. After a few days they let me go, I was alright.

Today, we're gonna take a step back from the totally drug related questions and ask an only kind of drug related question. Today, I'm wondering what kind of movies and television you guys like to watch. 

So, while not technically related to opiates or substance use/abuse in general, I know for myself and probably many others, my favorite movies and television shows have some pretty hefty drug use or at least are inspired by substances. However, some of you may not like drug related media, and that's totally valid, so don't feel like your answer has to be related to... *illicit substances*! 

So what do you like to watch? What's your favorite movie? What's your favorite television series? Do you have a favorite drug movie or drug TV show that's different from your regular favorites? Do you not enjoy movies? Do you not enjoy television? Please feel free to share your thoughts on all of the above, and as always, tell us why! 

Thanks everyone for all the discussion and thoughts you all bring to these threads. They literally could not happen without you. Hope everyone enjoys this break from the serious stuff, stay safe and Happy Nodding! ",1471496717.0

Well, about a half-hour ago we're down on the ground and I've got him in a figure-four leg lock and he turns his hand around and grabs my balls and dick simultaneously (he's got a big ol' hand), and looks me directly in the eyes while he's doing it. I see he's looking at me, then he raises that eyebrow, and of course I swoon as any red-blooded, wrestling-loving American Male would, and I release him. 

So, I stand up, drop trou, and he starts blowing me while I'm doing lines of blow off of a glass table, and after a few minutes of this, because of the coke, I go limp. I'm like, ""Let's do some shots of H and I'll be hard as a diamond and you can keep going to town my man!"" and he's like, ""Yeah! You'll be hard like a rock!"". Then he says, ""Wait, a rock. THE Rock. That's a cool nickname. Is it cool if I use that?"" and I'm like, ""Yeah, sure, keep sucking Dwayne.""

So, while he's blowing me I start fixing up the H on the glass table. I stir it up and then I put the fire to it and I'm like, ""Hey, Rock, can you smell-ll-ll-ll what the spoon is cookin'?"" and he's like, ""Hell yeah I can. Wait, that's a bad-ass catchphrase. Is it cool if I use that too?"" and I'm like, ""Shut the fuck up and suck this dick, Dwayne!"" so he does. 

And the rest is history. 

Plus, I told him about this other little black guy I used to fuck called Kev, and now they do movies together.

I went to my BFs house last friday to detox. Went cold turkey for 3 days.

Monday morning i said fuck it and went to cop. I did a tiny shot, but i had been up 36+ hours and had a small amount of ativan in my system from the night before.

Because of that and i guess the comfort release from withdrawal, i fell asleep in a parking lot.

Well, with my luck i woke up to a cop at the window. You know the drill, rig sitting out, gear in plain view. I screwed myself.

Got taken to the magistrate to be arraigned. And luckily because I'm white they released me into the custody of my BF. So didn't even make it to jail.

I've been clean since then, about 9:00 am monday morning. I don't think the small amount i did set me back a lot.

I've been dosing DXM to cope with withdrawal since. That shit has been doing wonders. 

I actually feel kinda good. I'm in a good place. I got this this time.

I know I'm not gone for good. But I'm getting clean for a while. And i may try to chip here and there. Like chip for real, and not over do it. Easier said than done, but whatever...

Obviously I have legitimate pain, and no time for surgery (don't have any PTO at work) so my options are outpatient stuff like injections, and of course opioids.

I have decided to use Propublicas Check Up to find a physician, and also check their reviews.

I have been on opioids before, and developed a tolerance. Got cut off when my doctor was arrested.

So my question is how do I walk that fine line to ensure myself to achieve my goal of being back on opioid treatment, and not placed on tramadol or Tylenol #3? 

Not really drug seeking as much as my back really is in bad shape and I am not having the easiest time walking.

And above all, **for a decent fucking price** . Fuck, I was so tired of the Mickey Mouse unprofessional fuck-around bullshit i had to go through to get high in Australia. By my last month there I was *FUCKING FINALLY* able to establish a *kinda* decent connection for dope, but for most of my time there it was one of those situations where someone said they had it, then you meet them and they say that they need to make a phone call to the guy that *actually* has it, who turns out to be halfway across the city, then you meet that guy that needs to meet yet *another* guy who needs the money *up-**FUCKING**-front* to go walk around the corner to go get the dope. Oh, and the price of dope? $50 a point. Yes, you read that correctly, $50 fucking dollars for .1 of dope. If you were able to come up with $200 you could sometimes get .5 for that. That was the going rate for coke and ice as well. Although coke was *extremely* hard to come by down under so if you wanted a ""speedball-like"" combo (which coke/heroin shot is my hands down absolute FUCKING favorite feeling ive ever had in my life, thus making it my go-to drug[s] of choice )you had to settle for ice. Which, by the way, the ice down there is absolute **garbage** . I had tried ice/meth/shard a few times in the states before I went down under, but it was never really my thing because shard here in the states is just *too* strong for me. When Id done ice in the states it seriously only took a few puffs off the ol' glass Dick for me to be awake for 2 and a half days with no appetite and no dope strong enough to bring me down from the high. Id never even *considered* shooting ice in the states because even smoking it was a bit intense for me. In Australia, shooting a $50 bag of ice (again, POINT FUCKING ONE) was like drinking a redbull or something to me. I could seriously eat and then fall asleep later that night if I felt like it after shooting what passes for amphetamines in australia. I never even got the chance to shoot any coke dowm there (to my absolute despair) because A- i never found a connect. And B- I absolutely *refuse* to pay 50 bucks for .1 of something that I pay $70 a *gram* for back home. 

But *today*, **IN THE UNITED STATES OF FUCKIN' AMERICA**, I called my dealer, told him what I wanted, we agreed on a price and a meeting place, I met him there and we exchanged cash for goods (he even gave me a little extra because it had been so long since I had seen him), and I was happily on my way. To all my people in the states, I know our drug laws are fucking attrocious, but we really do have it so good compared to some places in the world. I got to shoot my first speedball today in almost 8 months and I think I can safely say that Ive never been so happy to make it home after a backpacking trip.

I am always really honest with him and I told him what was going on. We have a very long history of me being in and out of treatment, on and off drugs and alcohol (mostly on) etc. He asked me if I wanted to get back in treatment and I said that under no circumstances was I going back to rehab. He looked at me and said, ""no, you would not benefit at all from rehab. It wouldn't make a difference"" which is completely true for many different reasons... This guy completely gets me. 

So he said ""I meant going back on suboxone."" I told him I'm not physically addicted right now and he was fine with that, only saying that it was obvious that I am unable to stop getting fucked up unless I have some sort of replacement, and that if I wanted he would start prescribing to me again. 

So, fuck it. Why not. I'm not ever going to 100% stop doing dope, but this way I have a safety net and a way to not completely throw everything away... Right now I've been using as often as I can afford, until my money is all gone and I hover on the edge of sickness half the week. I'm miserable doing shit this way and perfectly happy to take subs most of the time and be able to regulate my use instead of being completely controlled by it like I am now. 

This is probably going to be a controversial thread, since I'm basically admitting that I'm not going to be following the program completely. But I am a realist and I know that I can't stop using for good and I'm not going to try to tell myself that I can. 

Now that I have them, though, I'm nervous about getting back on them because I will be tied to medication once again, not being able to travel much unless massively planning ahead, having to do weekly counseling, all those UAs and being completely physically dependant on something again. 

But I'm going to try it out for a bit and see if I can gain some control back in my life. 

Today was weird. 

TL:DR: went to the doctor for one thing, walked out with a surprise sub script. ",1471471483.0

Enjoy! and comments and reviews are highly appreciated.


This occurred about 6 months ago, about a week after losing a high paying job. I had been clean the entire duration of my employment there, save for a few percs occasionally. Being occupied was pertinent to me staying clean, unemployed me knew it was only a matter of time before I had 5 bundles in my hand again, only this time I knew my wife would not be so understanding. She had been with me through countless relapses, was not a drug user herself and I could feel her patience wearing thin. But each time, she was there holding my hand, nursing me back to health. 

I got a message on Facebook around 2 that day, from a friendly local junkie who had a surplus of suboxone and some dope he referred to as ""china white"". Now without disclosing where I am, let's just say I was a tad bit skeptical of him coming across any true ""china white"". Honestly between us, the only time I had ever even heard of china white was in Pulp Fiction, surely he does not have access to this fictional brand of Quentin Tarantino dope, impossible! In hindsight, google tells me fentanyl is often referred to as china white, but this is a mistake I would learn from firsthand. Naturally, like a true and seasoned junkie*, I lie to my wife about where I'm going, hit the ATM then drive to the kid. 

He's waiting outside for me wearing one of those giant tacky hoodies with dragons all over it and a white fitted hat with no logo on it, hmm, guess the team is off playing an away game. Nonetheless I let him in the car, and he gives me the 10 suboxone I'm going to flip for an absurd come up, and the gram of ""china white"". It's in foil, which is uncommon as usually it comes in bags and bundles. I notice it is indeed extremely white, and particularly granular in its texture. I give him the wad of bills, and he pours me out a line from his stash. The generous junkie, how I love you so. ""So this is just dope right?..I don't see how we could get real china white out here.. that's that stuff from pulp fiction right?"" I nervously ask with a friendly smile. I definitely wanted to probe him about the origin of this strange dope, but didn't want to come off as too aggressive and have him take the line back. ""Yeah dude straight dope! here!"" he hands me a rolled up bill. The line is a bit bigger than the size of a line I'd normally do, so I asked him if I could save half for later. He gave me a funny look, but overall didn't mind if I saved the line, blew it, or stuck it up my ass. Into my tinfoil went the little white powder, and up my nose went the rest. 

""Bye Jake! thanks, i appreciate it!"" 

No sooner than I turned the car around, I started to get VERY high. Smiling ear to ear, light feeling, it was wonderful. By the time I reached my house, which was no more than 5 minutes away, I knew I would not be able to contain my inebriation. I cursed myself as I shut off the car, noticing how high my body temperature was becoming which got me a bit nervous. By the time I made my way up the stairs, my wife was already waiting to pepper me with questions but stopped completely when she saw my face. I was flush, sweaty, and the fun part of the high had subsided and made way for its scarier overdose counterpart. Being that I insufflate my dope and never did more than a couple bags at a time, I'd never come close to an overdose. She put me on the bed and began to panic, I was slurring like a lush and kept telling her I was sober but she was well aware I wasn't. I was thrown into an ice cold shower which after about 15 minutes, helped revive me a bit. Besides the vomiting, and feeling weak for the rest of the day, I was fine! I wish I could say this was my last experience with fentanyl, but of course it wasn't. What in the world could my junkie mind be thinking! you ask. ""Well if this dope could make me OD, it must be fucking GREAT! I'll just do a little less this time!"". Well I'm here to tell you, Drunk Hammahead and ""doing less"" don't go hand in hand. So the next day when I decided to get fucked up and experiment with the fentanyl again, it rightly could have been my last.

Keeping in spirit with my last story, we'll fast forward past the drunken antics and events of the night, and ill take you right up until 10 minutes prior to me fully losing consciousness. 

We pulled up to my house. I was with 3 of my friends who had no idea the extent of my addiction, and unaware I had been sneaking key bumps in the bathroom. I have no recollection of walking in, walking up the stairs, and sitting on my bed. I will switch to third person for the rest of the story, as it was told to me by the people around me. So to be clear, the ""she"" in the following paragraphs is referring to me.


Jeff had to carry her up the stairs and prop her up on the bed. She looked a little fucked up but it was typical drunk hammahead behavior. Everyone around was hanging out, smoking a blunt, telling funny stories and there was an all around good vibe. Her wife noticed something was wrong when her head sunk into her lap and she stopped moving. She grabbed her by the shoulders and started lightly tapping her cheeks. ""Wake up babe! Why do you always have to get so drunk!"". Her eyes were completely closed and she had drooled on her lap. When she released her shoulders and hamma fell to the floor, she knew something was very wrong. ""What the fuck did she take! What the fuck did she do with you guys!"" she screamed at the group she'd been on a drive with. ""Well we saw her doing some bumps in the car but she said it was coke..so.."" As they trailed off, clearly jarred at the sudden sharp turn of events, reality set in for her wife. She knew exactly what was on those *key bumps* and it certainly wasn't coke. She ran downstairs to get Hammas brother Chuck while Jeff and the others doused her in cold water and tried to resuscitate her. Per usual, Chuck was balls deep in a random girl with low self esteem, but he jumped out of that wide hole as soon as he heard the condition she was in (Side note, I love my brother, probably my favorite part of the story lol) By the time he came upstairs, she'd had stopped breathing completely. Her wife was pleading with Chuck to save her, help her, do something. She asked Chuck if she was breathing, he grabbed his sister, put her on his shoulder and didn't say a word. It was time to go to the ER. 

No one could think of what to do with Hammas dog while they all went to the ER, so puppy came with. One of the saddest things we all remember was Luna pawing at and licking her owner, howling, trying to make her come back. Despite several attempts they could not get the pitiful off her chest, or get the dog to stop whining and crying. Chuck was giving her CPR in the back seat, begging and pleading with her not to die, not like this. ""I love you fucking dumb bitch! Why do yo have to do this fucking drug!"" He wept but continued pumping air into her lungs, but it wasn't taking. Her lips were blue and icy, and she was totally unresponsive.

They had called ahead and told the hospital they were coming, and a couple nurses were outside with a wheelchair. They lept out of the car and quickly threw her into the chair, her lifeless limbs refusing to stay in the leg rests. The look on the nurses faces made all of their stomachs turn, without saying a word they wheeled her back in the ER and quickly got her on a stretcher. It looked like she was dead already, and when they pushed her into a back room, her pale foot dangling off the side hitting the door, they thought the next time they would see their friend was in a body bag. Her wife wept uncontrollably, screaming, and hospital staff did what they could to calm her. Everyone asked if she was going to make it, the doctor looked hesitant to answer and just told them to sit tight...

2 shots of Narcan later, here I am writing this story. I wish I could say I was totally clean but I just did 2 bags. Please please stay away from Fentanyl though, there's no fun way to use that drug. Everyone stay safe and I hope you enjoyed reading.

(x-post from /r/Drugs),"**Edit:** Thanks for the replies! I've decided not to take them. Casual use sounds like a myth, and Opiate addiction sounds like hell.

I've had about 8 or so Percocets (5/325) hanging around for a couple years. Never touched the stuff recreationally though, only used one or two when my knee pain would flare up (thankfully hasn't happened in a while). Probably only taken it around 5-6 times altogether.

It's hard for me to really judge if I have any worrisome addictive tendencies. And I know Opiates can be very addictive. From what I've read it sounds like Oxys aren't as bad as something like Heroin. But I'm still debating on whether or not to give it a try.

A little background on my use: First substance I really got into was Cannabis, first tried it about 2 years ago. Started smoking regularly after a couple months and eventually moved almost fully to dabbing concentrates. Daily use for about a year and a half now, around .2-.3g a day of concentrates. I had tried alcohol and cigarettes prior, but never really had any issues with them. Got absolutely wrecked my first time drinking, went way overboard with 15ish shots over a couple hours. Didn't really want to repeat that again. I'll drink occasionally but usually no more than 1-2 a night once or twice a week. As for cigarettes, I've been able to pick one up from time to time, enjoy it, and not crave another. I maybe have 1-2 a month if even that.

I've definitely felt the draw of other substances though, most notably GHB and Ketamine. I enjoy small bumps (50-60mg) of K with Cannabis and would probably do it a lot more often if it wasn't for the cost and potential bladder damage. Right now I do about 100mg over a couple hours about once a week. GHB I take about 4-5 grams worth over a few hours before bed about 3-4 times a week. Would probably use nightly if it weren't so costly, and from what I've read it doesn't really become a problem unless you're dosing quite often.

For what it's worth, also tried Amphetamine a couple times. Biggest use being a 120mg binge over the course of 6 hours. Felt like shit after and didn't even enjoy it all that much, was expecting much more. Tried many different Psychedelics as well, but I always space them out at least a week (usually longer). Music festivals being the only exception.

What keeps me from going overboard is the threat of permanent damage to my body. I've always been very big into harm reduction. And no experience is worth fucking yourself over. I even became worried about potential memory decline with regular Cannabis usage and to be on the safe side I started taking supplements and got pretty big into Nootropics. Which I still use to this day.

If I take the Oxys I plan on doing a CWE to get rid of all that APAP, and am thinking of a dose of 15-20mg. But I honestly want to know if it's even worth doing? I feel fairly confident in my ability to moderate usage, but I'm sure many have said the same thing before. With my background does it sound like something I might have an issue with? I'd like to experience it if I can do so safely, but the last thing I want to do is 2 months down the line be making posts here justifying a Heroin addiction.

Sorry for the wall of text, just wanted to make sure I provided enough details. Any input you could give me would be greatly appreciated!",1471590249.0

The poison Ivy look has almost completey gone away, but maybe thats just cuz of swelling??

It was raining off-and-on, but the corner boys are normally out in rain, sleet, hail, snow, (as the motto goes.) Sadly, the usual block I go to was completely deserted, so we went down the other streets next to it. Found one guy who was just chillin in his car, grabbed a few bags off him & bounced. After I fixed up like 2 I felt pretty nice, then I blacked out. When I finally came to, we were still in the car but I obviously missed some of the drive. I must have been out for a good 5 mins, my friend was thoroughly freaked out, of course & was kinda pissed off at me, saying he didn't know if I was even breathing but my eyes were rolled back, according to him. Idk why he wasn't trying to wake me up or take me to a hospital, I seriously could've been dying next to him and he didn't do shit, but I guess cause I wasn't turning blue or anything he wasn't too worried.. But that is seriously the first time that I ever blacked out, in all my years of doing dope I've never ended up that fucked up. I'm pretty certain that the bags I got had fentanyl in them, which is crazy cause I don't believe I've encountered that shit before but it's  definitely scary, that was my first close call like that, I've never ODed, but this is just giving me more motivation to get on methadone cause I've been planning it for a little while.

I have been on Suboxone maintenance for about 8 months now. 29 years old, male, about 150 pounds. I have slowly tapered down to about 4-3mgs a day. 2 days ago on Tuesday night something happened to me that I have never heard of happening to anyone.

So for the last week (Last Tuesday - To This Tuesday) I started using dope again. The dope was very very good and busted through the Bupe within 2 days. I was feeling good and life was good. On Tuesday night everything was normal and I was feeling good, I did a little line, chilled out, then went to bed around 1130PM. This is where shit gets weird.

Around 530-6AM I wake up and slightly short of breathe but not too bad and have the most UNCONTROLLABLE shakes. Every single part of my body was shaking to the maximum. Legs, arms, face, jax, teeth; it was very scary. It was Parkinsons to the max.  I didn't know what to do to get it to stop. The only thing I can think of was either do a little dope and maybe it will calm it down or do a little sub and maybe it will stop the shaking. I chose to do the sub and it calmed down things started to normalized and I was able to go back to sleep. The past 2 days have been pretty rough and I have been only taking subs, a very little amount at time. I am finally starting to feel a little better.

What do you think caused this freak shaking incident?

Do you think it was because I went from taking 3-4mg of subs per day to absolutely zero and it finally caught up to me after a week? Do you think it had something to do with the dope?

My theory is the subs because when I was shaking unctrollably the subs calmed me back down slightly and basically saved my life.

Any experiences or opinions are very much welcomed and thankful.

First, I take a shit before the festivities, because we all know that isn't going to happen once the fun begins.

Next, I stick my finger into some distilled water and snort it into each nostril to wet my mucous membrane for maximum absorption.

Then, I go to my room and pack a nice fat lip before I dump out a bag or two of heroin (depending on my tolerance at the time) onto my preferred surface, then chop that shit up nice and fine with a credit card and make my line.

After I do that, I turn on the shower to the hottest setting and close the bathroom door.  I return to my room and sniff the line evenly distributing it between each nostril, or a little more into the more dominant nostril at the time ending with giving my nose a little pinch. I then head into the now steamy bathroom and take a deep breath of the steam aiding the absorption further.  I bring a gatorade, water, or a beer with me into the shower to help wash down the inevitable drip.

I get in the shower and usually sit down while my nicotine and opiate combo kick in. I close my eyes and enter the serene poppy fields.  I feel the tension of the day release and the soreness in my legs melt away.  After a few minutes I get up and finish my shower and am effectively high and in a fantastic mood for the rest of the evening!

Today is special because I did my ritual, and am now heading out with some friends for dinner.  I love getting ready for a night out with the content pleasure of the opiate high.

Part of me wants to send her text message asking if we should try being a couple. Another part is worrying if this relationship turns into a disaster. 

I'd like to hear the opinions of this opiate loving subreddit.

So the oxy I got was definitely real. It was one of the OG crushable 80's and it was sick. Thats good news

I got another message that she had reupped, went and checked them out, they were thicker than my last oxy, with the same CDN 80 (Canadian, here) imprint. So I let her know, as she doesn't do them, and we ripped one open. Solid blue the full way through, slightly off from the regular blue/green of the CDN 80's, and with that I let her know that these were either a fake oxy press, likely fentanyl.

Hello all, 

My family and I will be going on vacation soon. I don't have much experience flying. I do get a script for pain meds which I will be bringing with me however, I also need to bring Valium with me as well which I do not have a script for. There's no way I will be able to fly without them because I can get some pretty bad anxiety. 

We will be flying out of a pretty big city airport that I do believe has those full body scanner, if that'll make a difference. I don't plan on bringing many, maybe 5. So what would be the best way to do this with out there being any trouble? Would they even pay much attention to it if I just put them in with my pain meds even though they don't look alike?

I'm sure questions like this get asked a lot, sorry and thanks in advance to anyone that answers.

Hope you all are having a great morning so far. ☺️",1471701575.0

A couple months prior I would use ridiculous abounds of codeine (320-640 mg) almost daily and snorting hydromorphones whenever I could get them, usually doing around 10-16 mg in a day. This went on for a bit over a year. Luckily I never got physically addicted to opiates but needless to say I developed a tolerance.

While I was actually in the hospital for surgery and everything I was hooked up to an iv drip the whole time giving me morphine and dilaudid. I never recreationally used needles but I have to admit it made me feel pretty damn good. The problem began once I left the hospital.

They prescribed me just 2 mg of hydromorphone every two hours. It worked for about a week and a half before they started to be ineffective. I literally just turned 18 a month before the accident so I was still living with my parents, and they're aware of how much codeine I was using so they're hesitant to give me pills. I can't just ask for a second pill 20 minutes later if the pain isn't elevated enough from the first one, they'll make me wait the whole 4 or 6 hours depending on the prescription before they'll give me another one because they think I'm trying to use it to get high. (Off only 4 mg of hydromorphone LMFAOO.) This led to me stashing the pills until I got 2 or 3 then snorting them with a bit of warm salt water to aid absorption and smoking lots of weed when the pain acts up.

I got codeine about a week ago just for fun and I confirmed that my tolerance went even higher from being on hydro constantly for a month. Even my ridiculously highdoses felt slightly less than half as strong as i was used to. 

Just a couple days ago my doctor switched me to just 5 mg percocet. One of them literally does nothing. Not a thing. I need at least 3 to feel mild relief and its hard to get the amount I need when I need it (like when I need to sleep) because my parents assume I'm just doing it to get high.

So my question is, how do I tell my doctor I need a higher dose because of my tolerance? I actually stopped using opiates for the most part a month or two before the accident but I can't see myself getting a good reaction from telling my doctor ""the dosage is too low, I need more because I have a tolerance from abusing similar medications."" Does anyone have similar experiences? How should I approach my doctor about this?",1471700496.0

So, I'm now on my second family vacation of the year (we have a little house by the sea we visit every so often just to get away) It's the same as before, I used lope to come off again, and by day 3 I was feeling mostly back to normal. I wasn't using a lot, so it wasn't severe, but the sleep for me is the worst part of any withdrawal. I'm not 8 days without sleep, FORCING myself to appear okay in front of the family by going with them to everything, the beach, restaurants, shopping.. whatever they want to do, I tag along and force myself to interact.  

But the past 2 days, I hear people start to move around in the house around 7-8am, I fall out of bed like a sloppy piece of putty and climb into the shower, which wakes me up temporarily. I get to the kitchen and force some coffee into me. It's getting way worse, not better. The withdrawals were gone, but now because of severe sleep depravation I've started to get cold sweats occasionally, I feel so fucked. This is always the point for me where I use again because I feel like my brain is on fire. I've got to help with the 5 hour drive back home tomorrow and I'm either going to drive off the road or get home and immediately score and go straight to bed. I know I've done well and come a long way, but fuck withdrawal, I hate this shit so much - what an endless cycle of bullshit. Longest I've gone is 12 days no sleep (is that a world record?) before relapse. I can handle most of the physical effects, they pass fairly quickly, it's always the sleep thats last to return.  I wonder if I've been getting a cut like benzos that I'm polyusing without realising and I'm coming off that too.

Not because it is necessarily painful, or controversial, or hard to understand. No, it's tough, because for some of us, there isn't a real answer. Sometimes we choose an answer, but when it comes time for that answer to come true, we change it. Today /r/opiates, I'm asking, what would it take to make you quit?

Current users, what would finally make you say no more? Former users, what was it that convinced you to stop using? Is there even an answer at all for some of us? If you've quit before but are now back on, what was it that made you quit? Could anything at all make you quit, or do you have no plans to? As always, to any of the above questions, why? 

Here's a little personal update and the reason I asked this question today (stop reading if you don't care, it really won't hurt my feelings). As of today I am officially going on opiate hiatus. Unfortunately the time has come to end my heroin use, and I start down the fucking terrible road of quitting. My reasons will be discussed below (yay QotD discussion!) but I wanted to update to let you guys know some things. First- I will not be as active a member of the community. I know I've only been active here a very short time, but after today it will be considerably less so. Second- I fully intend to keep up the Question of the Days! I love you guys' responses and stories and I spend a good chunk of my day reading them, so I definitely don't want to lose that.

I may quit one day, but for now I order some maybe once every 1-3 months, do it for a day, and pour the remainder down the toilet before I go to bed. Typically when I start to get paranoid about the frequency of my breathing going down.

Anyway, I call the situation manageable because I haven't gone on a multi-day usage campaign since before I went to rehab, a little under 3 years ago. I'm very paranoid about low tolerance getting me into trouble, so I always tiptoe into the pool so to speak, and keep some adderall and caffeine with me in case I start to get nervous. I never go to sleep while high.

Anyway, back to the title, my money situation isn't bad, so I can afford to overpay for heroin online, thus avoiding a situation where I have to put myself in sketchy situations with local dealers who can get me a fix in mere hours or even minutes. When I order online, I have to wait at least 4 days if not 10. This makes my whole ritual of having a heroin holiday much less impulsive.

The most helpful thing for me as far as my money situation goes is that I don't feel any regrets throwing it all down the toilet before I go to bed. I feel like if I were more worried about money I might not be able to do this, thus putting me on a multi-day dope binge with a minimum buy of 0.5 to 1 grams of heroin or fentanyl (yikes!), getting me dopesick, and really getting towards to true addict situation I've seen that one time I went to rehab and the ""real"" heroin addicts laughed at me when I tried to relate to them about being dopesick.

Pills worry me, but as far as heroin goes, I'm able to avoid being a heroin addict because I have money.

Not sure why I posted this, maybe it will give some of you ideas as to how to do this thing without ending up in rehab or worse. Probably just looking for feedback I dunno. I can't discuss this little hexaennial ritual of mine with anyone I know or they'll send me back to the reeducation camp!",1471667901.0

The best thing he ever told me was it's not fair for them to be my friend while I am an addict. For them to continually worry about me overdosing, or possibly getting shot in some gutter behind a decaying ghetto bungalow or whatever shit sober people thinks typically happens to addicts like us. 
    It's not fair to watch a beautiful soul born with so much potential actively limit and diminish himself with every drink, inhalation, injection or insufflation. That is the point where your friends or family look at the situation and decide its better to let you go. Frankly I agree with them and understand their perspective. This conversation always stuck with me and it rings true timelessly. When it comes down to it being a drug addict is a selfish lifestyle choice. I understand the ""choice"" is really a disease and we lack self control however as someone who has been through every facet of addiction and recovery, lost it all and gained it back only to lose it again. I do believe we make a choice when we decide to use again ad nauseam. 
    It is now chemically ingrained in my psyche and influencing my priorities to the point where I completely understand why so many of us contemplate suicide, myself included. I used to look up to the bukowski's, the hunter s. thompsons, the huxley types but it's come to the point where I have to let go of that mentality (im more of a joyce, dostoevsky, hemingway type now) . The truth is that the most debilitating thing about someone's life either sober or addicted is that people who don't try to reach above and beyond what is in their comfort zone are the people we shouldn't want to become. Using drugs doesn't make a person better or worse because the fact of the matter is plenty of sober people settle for a mediocre existence. 
    We can argue that if someone is happy why should they change, well the people who strive for greatness are the ones who made the largest impact on this world. Sadly a lot of those people who wanted more became megalomaniac dictators or greedy materialistic pieces of shit. I think for people like us however is that drugs use sets apart from the status quo which is good because we have seen and felt things most people couldn't imagine. So many people like us have compassion that is unmatched by the most generous of lovers. However its not enough to feel like we're living in the clouds but rather we need to reach past them to untap the greatness we have within ourselves. ",1471666629.0

I recently got a bonus at work and instead of saving some money, i decided to do triple my usual amoint of those blue bastards this past week.

Im not necessarily trying to quit using, but i do want to cut back significantly.

I know u4 doesnt last long, but if it gives some energy and helps me sleep, why not?

Do you guys think this would be a ok combo? Does anyone out there have some experience with mixing the 2?  I appreciate all the input u peeps give!

I tried a little over a week ago and couldn't seem to register. I tried the main roper in the crook of my arm and managed to get the nice plume on the first try. 

I probably didn't do enough, I felt it for sure but it wasn't the rush that I was expecting. I certainly don't plan on doing it frequently, if at all because the prepping process is just too much for me to fuck with, especially when sick, but it was cool to give it a shot.

The positive is that it would certainly conserve dope, but it would also lead me down a shittier path than I'm already on, so I feel pretty confident that I won't do it again.

For now atleast,I had posted here about legal troubles last week and having a warrant from missing court back in NY and whatnot for petit larceny and hypodermic instrument charges. Well I was confused cause when looking up my name on our counties court website it said I had a failure to appear and the. It showed a new court date for September 23rd but didn't say anything about a bench warrant. I have been so paranoid about getting pulled over here in NC and getting extradited back to NY since all day for work we drive around to service calls and spend most of the day on the road so chances for a traffic stop are high. Having my boss be my dboy and our work truck being the trap truck as well didn't help me paranoia. So today I called the courts back in NY just to double check about my warrant and they transferred me to the warrant bureau. And to my surprise I have no warrants or anything under my name back in my old county. Even the warrant bureau the guy I talked to said it was weird cause there should be a bench warrant out for me if I missed my court date 10 days ago. He said he didn't understand why I didn't have one but he said it was my lucky day lol. So why do I not have a bench warrant yet? Has this happened to anyone else before? I'm sure eventually I'll have one but it's a huge sigh of relief to know if I get pulled over I can give my real name to the officer and not worry about getting locked up.

I posted these links in another sub after some drug test questions and some incorrect info being spread. Thought it could be useful if anyone searches here for drug test info. I'm going to guess most of you know all of this but hopefully new users running here for drug test questions can find these charts. 

Basic tests that only test for ""opiates"" will only show codeine or morphine. Oxycodone will not show up on these. Oxycodone does not metabolize to morphine at all.  

Codeine and morphine *may* metabolize into hydrocodone and hydromorphone in high doses, but not the other way around so Hydro should not show up on these basic opiate tests either (I have heard of it happening though. I don't know if it's true. It doesn't really make sense that it would) . None of the other sythnthetic opioid should show up either (fentanyl, tramadol, methadone)

Oxycodone is usually the next one tested for but not until maybe 11 or 12 panel (not sure if these are standardized) You can usually tell by the name of the test if you can see that info. Or if you can sometimes look up the lab (if it's going to a lab) and the test name and find out what it's looking for.  There are pain management panels that will group a bunch of pain meds in one (oxy, hydro, methadone, tramdol, fentanyl) along with other drugs.  Any drug can be tested for specifically so keep an eye out for that.  They could order a 5 panel test but also add the tramadol test.  


Even if you ignore whatever I wrote above, these charts are nice.

Just my experience and was wondering what everyone else's experience and or personal value on this ineffective compound for me maybe it was dose or something if so people advice would be much appreciated but from my encounters with codeine so far i have no value in it and don't think i shall be using it anytime soon recreationally.",1471759917.0

Tomorrow, I leave to attend my 4th (and last) year at Uni. Packed everything up all day today, including my safe with all of my dope inside. I had a moment where I thought about taking out a couple bags just in case I wanted them later.

Before today, I have used 5 consecutive days in a row, and I really need a tolerance break.  Using this rationale, I put my safe with all of my dope in it in a pair of jeans at the very back corner of my suitcase underneath a mountain of clothing.

Tonight, I was exhausted from packing all day, and went to bed early (Eyes unfocused.. *nod out*... oh yeah this is the good stuff) with the hopes of sleeping through the night. Now cue waking up 3 hours later and the only thing on my mind is my vice. Heroin.

I try to fall asleep again, unsuccessfully and resolve to get my fix.  I put some pants on and go downstairs. I have to go outside through the basement because going through the garage is too loud, and I certainly don't want to wake my parents

I grab my flashlight and get to the garage through the basement. I thought the truck would be inside, but I was mistaken and had to go outside. At the door, for a moment I thought it was raining and reconsidered my venture. I opened the door to find it was a beautiful night, just very windy.

In hindsight, if it was raining I wonder whether or not I would have still went through with it.. In all reality, more than likely.

So I go out and open the bed of my father's truck which is packed to the brim with all of my shit. Boxes upon boxes upon suitcases upon (*nods out*) more shit.  I fight with the cover of the bed of the truck and finally get it open after smashing my already cut finger. I realize I still can't reach it, so I have to open it even further.

I open one suitcase, and of course it is the wrong one. So I move even more shitttttt (*nodded*) and finally found the suitcase I was looking for wedged in the very back corner of the bed. I had to lift out a very heavy moving box in order to get to it. I fought with the zipper which was stuck against the bed of the truck and finally got it open.

I rummaged through all my neatly packed clothes, to the very bottom where I found my safe in my jeans at long last. Open the safe, get my drugs, and now I have to put everything back.

I am now high as fuck and have indulged in the fruits of my labor. I could have saved myself a hell of a lot of effort if I had just left a couple bags for myself when packing, but I wanted to see if I could have self control for one damn day. Guess I don't.

I felt awful about myself while dumping out the bags and making my lines, but now I am content as a cucumber.. that's the nature of the beast though and why it is such a hard drug to manage, and why it has ruined oh so many lives.

God, please help me while I am at school because the temptation will be even greater, as being able to do it will be much easier. This has gone too far.

I was talking to a friend about my newfound addiction, and he wisely told me that at least I am aware of my addiction, and have to do my best to not use multiple days in a row while I am at school.  Also he said that kicking a couple bag a day addiction isn't too hard yet and to get out before I am balls deep in the grasp of heroin's pleasure. I appreciate having him as a friend as he is one of the very limited people in my life who know about my abuse and he is one of the few people who legitimately care for me and care about my wellbeing. So if you are reading this, thanks for all you do brother, you're a true friend.

Now I realize many of you have gone through a hell of a lot worse to get your fix, and I am not having a dick measuring contest.  Still though, now I know the lengths I will go through to chase this high. Which feels damn good right now. I am positively reinforcing my junkie behavior, and this seems like the start of a potentially lifelong struggle. Damn. At least I am aware of my abuse of this drug.

Thanks for reading guys. The entire time I was thinking... Now this is some junkie behavior. What have I become...

What are some of the stories you guys have when you finally crossed the line into addiction? What is some of the hell you have gone through to get your fix? I'd love to hear your stories as well, as having a conversation with you guys is always a good time.

He made me leave him alone on his 24th birthday and he sent me an email telling me that if anything happens that I was the only woman he has ever loved and the only one to steal his heart. WHY the fuck did I not go see him. He died not even hours later. :( He has kept me alive for 9 years and helped me escape a hostage relationship. He showed me that any person can feel loved by at least one person in their life. So I get to his house and the coroner had just finished up and there were needles and a plastic baggie (make shift) with white residue. He used to be addicted to heroin but had been clean for almost 4 years. My heart broke seeing his blue turning face as I got to say good bye. He tried to take a gun home with him, claiming he wanted to go shooting for his birthday. I said fuck no, because we were fighting. That should have been my hint. But no. I could have saved him or tried at least. I miss him so immensely. It's messed up but if he would have just told me then I would have been understanding as he had been speaking of rehab for alcohol addiction. I understand the whole one last bang before you stop. We aren't even sure. It could have been a seizure as well but he made me a promise and now I want to die. I feel so at fault for not spending his birthday with him. I think he knew his liver was giving out and he knew it. I'm thankful for him being at peace and not crippled with anxiety. Mental health should been more important. I've had one other person die in my life but I never thought it would take my poor man :'(  I am so numb. I haven't eaten in 7 days :'( I miss him every second that I think.  Any ideas of how to heal from this would be appreciated. He is forever loved.",1471855234.0

And I don't know if this is just in my head, but I seem to get withdrawals faster now. I get it in between doses. In the few hours in between, my legs start to ache and I start to get the shits that gets progressively worst. Is this just in my head? I don't think it's possible. But now I use so much just to get rid of withdrawals. I use the minimum amount it will take to keep withdrawals at bay, and so i don't even get high off this amount. But no matter what, this amount keeps having to increase. I can't take the sickness. I don't have money for this anymore. I really don't. I've already spent so much. I have 3g of butyrfent because that costs me like $50 and it might last me longer. I don't know what I'm going to do once that is gone. I don't know how long 3g of butyrfent will last once I'm out of heroin.

Understand, heroin is like a cheat, a window, to obtain a state.
It's like seeing to believe, if you know the state exists then it is in fact possible. That is also indicated from the fear from the major delusions. But, we must know the enemy to defeat it. If you can see the destination, the more you focus on it the more you become the conduit of the path. The more you realize you are the path. 
In dealing with yourself as the process to an outcome you are both the outcome and the enemy to the outcome.  You've obviously been suffering, you obviously then must be wanting to suffer in order to understand suffering as a whole, so as to not be suffering. By understanding a subject both inside and outside of its pattern and thus as its pattern. Then, repeat yourself infinitum. You can either know the speed in which something is moving or its location, but you can not know both.
You are in pain, you temporarily can end this pain, and in doing so you know of bliss. When you return from your temporary state you can't unsee the destination of bliss though, so naturally you try to become the movement to bliss, and that's the cheat. Because you're still using heroin to get there friend.
You were supposed to only know of it by cheating. The planet which communicates to its animals through chemistry put it there as a window for the darkest times, both mentally and physically. Then some asshole monkeys came along and tried to take it from you and blame you! You, for the darkness. And maybe darkness is as such because it is not indicative of self. But please know that they, and not you are it. Don't let it's ignorance infect you any more.
  Stop beating yourself up, right now. You've been mimicking stagnation in your confusion. Hopefully you are understanding  enough now that you can at least recognize it. So be the friction against it. All of this pining for being against it must be of the place where you actually are against it. So again, be the friction that is against it.
 See every time that you have failed on the path as a reminder of the path, as the path. 
Hate the path no more and in doing so, invariably hate yourself no more. You have to set your sights on the destination and understand yourself as the destination then as well.
Time is relative, this whole disk you've been in is dependent of you. So know, somehow, somewhere you are there. 
Now get moving, and if you have to crawl, crawl.

So, I play basketball at a park near my house about as often as I can, trying to get fit, lose weight, etc. So, I'm out there and this guy that I've seen out there a few times rolls up in his Cadillac. I notice him and he's just sitting in his car for like, 5 minutes. Then he gets out, walks over to the nearest trash cans and throws something away that's too small to see from about 15 feet away. The first thing I think is, ""He just snorted a bag or two, and now he's throwing the bags away in that trashcan.""

A supposition that was a bit of a leap, I'll give you that, but I had a little evidence that I was right from yesterday. We were shooting around, and he looked kinda high to me, but I didn't say anything at the time. I said to myself, ""This guy is either drunk or high, but I'm voting high.""

Well, today we start talking and I mention that I used to live in this area of my county where drugs are plentiful but that I didn't know that back when I lived there, and at the time I was driving 2 hours both ways to get dope from a faraway town. He says, ""Dope, like weed?"" and I reply, ""Nah, dope dope."" ""Oh, Heron."" ""Yeah, that's how I get down."" ""You sniff it or shoot it?"" ""I bang that shit man, but I do both depending on whether I've got a rig handy. You just lose too much of it shooting it, like 40-60% of it."" ""Aw man, I've never shot that shit. I know I like sniffing it so much, I'm worried that if I shoot it, I'll lose everything I've got."" ""Nah man, there ain't nothing to it, you just get a better rush, that's all.""

Then he walks out to the three point line and before he pulls up for his shot (haha) he says, ""If I make this shot I'm shooting up tonight!"" Then, he swishes that motherfucker (dude can shoot, by the way). He's like, ""Man, you think you could shoot me? Get me off?"" I'm like, ""You throw me a bag and we'll go do that shit right now!""

He ponders for a second, and says, ""Aight, let's go.""

So we drive the 3 minutes from the park back to my place, and he shows me the bag he's gonna give me. It's not a monster but I mean, a free bag just to shoot somebody up? Fuck yeah!

So, I get dude off. He had really huge fucking veins so it was a cake walk, then I go ahead and do my bag. And it's one of those creepers, the ones that take 10-15 seconds to really peak, so you know it's good ass, real talk, heroin. It looked good in the spoon and everything.

So, we get to talking some more and I'm like, ""Man, I go through a middle and this dude is fucking taxing the shit out of me."" He says, ""Shit man, I can get you a bun for 130. I mean, I get them for 100 but I'll just charge you the 30."" (Normally I have to pay 150-200 a bun from this cocksucking assfucktrain bastard, Street Name: Boogie. So I say, ""Fuck yeah man, I get paid in a couple days, I'll definitely be calling you."" ""Cool deal man, yeah we can get this shit together.""

Then he says, ""Aight man, I gotta go pick up my old lady. Anyway, can you hit me again with this last bag I got?""

He lays me out a bump, and the rest, as they say, is badass. 

TL;DR Knew a dude was high, steered the conversation to drugs, was right that he was high, got a free bag for shooting him up for the first time and a new connect that's gonna save me a bunch of money! F-U-C-K Y-E-S!

Edit: Maybe this will mitigate some of the criticism that's been leveled. He said he normally snorted 3-4 bags at the time and I shot him up with 1. Afterwards his exact words were, ""Yeah man, I guess I just really have a tolerance, all that really did was make me feel a little warm."" He had 3 bags left out of what I'm assuming was a bun, so he had already done 7 and as high as he already was I don't think he ended up feeling much out of the shot, really. I think all in all it was a fairly lackluster experience for him.",1471846853.0

I know how to CWE my percs, klonopin is just klonopin, but with the morphine I am having a problem! Oral morphine sucks, as the bioavailability is so low. I have read of what seem to be the two main techniques to get controlled release morph into immediate release morph. 

1: Mix into an acidic solution (cola? Citric acid?) and let it sit for anywhere from 8-24 hours. I like for my methods to be a bit more specific than that!

2. Crush tablets as finely as possible, mix with water and plug. Might I also mention that most posts I've found about this topic are usually quite a few years old, so even though I have found mention about how gummy the morph becomes in liquid, I am not sure if this is how things are currently. When I tried it earlier everything seemed to get so gummy that it just stuck to the syringe walls.

Please help me figure out how to correctly use these methods (or others if you have them!!) to make the most out of these meds! I am on much less than I was before (if you've seen my previous posts), and I want to use this 2 week supply in the most efficient and safe way possible.

This one was hidden and I missed it so I emptied out all the hardened APAP into a glass as well as dropping the filter itself in there, added water, waited 15 mins, mixed it all together, wrung out the filter and damn If I didn't get a decent little buzz off of it.

When I have a dozen or so left over, I'll re-wash half of them and get full-on blasted so clearly there is plenty of oxy left in the filter material and apap powder.

But over the past 10 days I wasn't able to take a shit to save my life. Normally after 4/5 days I'll have a bowel movement but this time it just wasn't happening. I was using a lot of heroin though a lot more than normal over the past few weeks so that was obviously the cause. But anyway today I took a break to make myself start withdrawals just so I would be able to shit. I finally did thankfully cause I was about to give up and get high. My boss just dropped me off a nice bag so I was so tempted to just give in and stay constipated but I have it one last shot and it worked. My stool was huge and extremely hard I felt like I was shitting out rocks. It kinda hurt to get out I was pushing like I was giving birth lol my face was red and I had veins popping out of my forehead and neck pushing so hard. But my question was there was some blood in my stool when I wiped there was some red on the toilet paper. I was guessing it was from the stool being so deprived of water and making it hard and hard to get out it probably made a small tear or cut. Is this normal or is this something I should get checked out? A few years ago I had blood in my stool and I went to the hospital and I had an ulcer. This was a lot less blood and my stomach didn't hurt like when i had the ulcer. So is this normal?  ,1471816294.0

Well, I have a friend ive known for about 12 years now. He's become a real asshole and uses me nonstop. First time he crossed the line, I would use my PayPal here account or my girls to swipe his credit card and give him cash. Ya know, tryna look out. Well one time we did this but he used his fathers credit card and my girls account for 400 dollars. Well I gave him the cash, and a week later his mom calls the credit card because he denied it and she said it was stolen. So my girls account went negative. Of course I felt terrible and paid her the money but he made no effort to repay me or even apologize. So after that I watched my step. The other day he comes by and buys 4 bags, all is good so he calls me up 3 hours later and says he wants me to front him another 4 for only 5 hours.  I reluctantly agreed but yold my girlfriend this was the last straw. My last test. Sure enough he doesn't call that night....nor the next....I text him the day after just random bullshit to see how he would react. Sure enough he doesn't mention it. So that's it. I say I'm done, and tell my girl 40 bucks is a small price to pay to learn his true colors. A week fast forward to tonight, he hits me up, knowing I'm sitting on a sleeve, begging to sell him 6 bags at double the price. You guys think I should do it and rape him for the money, or say fuck you, knowing that no one else will serve him and he'll withdraw. He has no connects cause hes done this many time. Any advice?

Coming down from doing a bunch of crystal last night has had my thoughts extra meaningful-(if that makes sense), have been pondering life and things pertaining to life all night and day.

 After writing and rewriting this all day long, I've finally finished with something I'm actually satisfied with. So giver a read, if you will and let me know what my fellow opiate enthusiasts think. (Oh and also I literally just finally finished a version that I was happy with, so I haven't proofread it for spelling/grammatical errors.)

Time is precious and you can never get back the time that you've spent. All you'll ever have as a receipt too show how you've spent your days throughout each chapter of your life, are the memories that you have created and chose to cherish. All you can really do for the time being is live in the now, not dwell on the past, and not stress about who or where you will be in the future. Nobody will ever know what the future holds for themselves in 15 years time, or even what it may hold for them tomorrow. After all, tomorrow is never guaranteed. Your future is created by you, upon the choices you make whether you realize a certain choice will have such a drastic butterfly effect, or not. Either way there will always be a consequence and you must live with it good or bad, because it ultimately derived from your very own decisions, your choices. Time is precious so spend the time you're given and the time you'll never get back fulfilling things you know will add genuine happiness to your life in the now, and doing whatever you can that will leave you feeling content with your life and who you are as a person, in the now.

4ywyrv,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/4ywyrv/free_will_and_addiction/,3,https://redd.it/4ywyrv,Minuted,Free will and addiction.,"I'm curious about everyone's philosophical views regarding free will and addiction?

I had a pretty bad winter. I've had bad depressions before but it was the first time I'd been physically and emotionally dependent on opiates. When I was in withdrawal I couldn't help thinking about deep philosophical questions, mostly regarding free will but also about meaningless. It's been a feature of my depressive states in the past but it really hit me hard this past winter.

I'm currently trying to sort myself out. I'm on buprenorphine while trying to get my life in order. That's great, and I'm doing better than I was, in fact much better, but still, I'm finding it difficult not to think about these things when I'm having a bad day.

Personally, I believe in determinism. In the sense that I believe we are part of a causal chain of events. Whether I consider individuals morally responsible for their actions, I'm not sure. I don't think the world would be a better place if we didn't hold ourselves responsible for our actions, but I can definitely see a nasty self-indulgent facet in the idea of compatibilism. I'm hoping it's just the petulant child in me that will calm down and stfu as I start taking responsibility for my life, but I can't help but feel as though it encourages our desire to compare ourselves to others. Maybe that's a part of human nature. Maybe we need to compare our actions to those of others to determine their value. I just can't help but feel that it's something we shouldn't encourage. Like violence, or racism, it's something that is inherent in our nature but should be considered as something we need to keep a lid on. Maybe when we compare ourselves to others, we reinforce the idea that we can't find value in ourselves, independent of others. The act of condemning or praising the actions of others is what drives our need to condemn or praise others. Am I making sense or do I sound like a crazy person? lol

As I said, I don't think the world would be a better place if we didn't hold people responsible. But I find the need people have to find value in themselves only through caparison to others... well, I think it's a little sad. I hope that one day we all find it much easier to be content with just being ourselves, with no need to conform to the ideas of others. Whether that'd be the end of society, who knows? :P

I don't know. I honestly try not to think about it too much, just get on with life, but it's just sort of... there. And I don't think it's ever going to go away. I'm really curious to know what you guys think about this kind of stuff? I wonder if being an addict changes your perspective?",1471811827.0

On Friday that plan crashed and burned. 

It was my aunts birthday and my family makes a big production out of birthdays. Having my extended family in one place is likely to resort in a squabble. It inevitably did between my mom and aunt regarding a cheesecake recipe. That's where my sister and I left to go to the bar for a drink.

We walked over to the bar and left our cars at home. While we were gone my mom moved my car because where it was parked it was blocking my aunt and uncle. There she found rig caps and empty stamps. 

By the time we returned home my sister was tipsy and I was hammered. When we got into the house my entire extended family and my mom where waiting to confront me. 

I was too drunk to lie or deny. From my foggy memory I remember saying something along the lines of “yeah I’m using again so what?” meant defensively but came out angrily. This resulted in a tirade of “This is going to kill you” from my mom. Which I replied to “I haven’t died yet” and stormed out into my car to go home. 

Thankfully I was to drunk to get the key in the ignition. I gave up and passed out for the night in my drivers seat. I woke up to my mom knocking on my window. She told me to get out of her driveway and not to come back. 

That’s about it. It sounds less horrifying when I type it out but I’m still very ashamed of the whole situation. Alcohol and secrets don’t mix well.

I know dope kills the desire to listen to music for some people, but not me; I like to soundtrack anything I'm doing. Right now I'm digging on Lydia Loveless's new record, particularly [Out on Love](http://youtu.be/r8-Pl7u1wyM) which is perfect for nodding out to. The Hard Working Americans new record ""Rest in Chaos"" is phenomenal as well; yall should check out [Ascending into Madness](http://youtu.be/jL_TV6IHFWU), I'm sure I ain't the only one on this sub who can relate to it. Usually I'll put on some Neil Young (Cortez the Killer or the [Horseback version of Cortez](http://youtu.be/xdaBLO1kj00) are classics to put on when fucked up and I believe ""Tonight's the Night"" is the greatest druggy album of all time), Wilco, My Morning Jacket, the Velvet Underground/Lou Reed, Sparklehorse, Will Oldham/Palace/Bonnie Prince Billy, anything by Jason Molina, Vic Chesnutt, Mazzy Star, certain Dylan records (Blood on the Tracks, Desire, New Morning) Neko Case, Sun Kil Moon/Red House Painters, Low, Silver Jews, Gram Parsons, JJ Cale, Dinosaur Jr., the War on Drugs, Kurt Vile, Lucero, Townes Van Zandt or some of Ryan Adams' more mellow shit. Ambient/post rock like Mogwai, Brian Eno, the Album Leaf, Explosions in the Sky, Aphex Twin or even Boards of Canada are great too. The soundtrack/score to Twin Peaks really compliments an opioid daze as well.

It's no mystery why jazz and heroin have such an intertwined history. Miles Davis, Coltrane, Charlie Parker, Chet Baker, Monk, Django, and even Louis Armstrong all seem perfect to me after booting up. I dare anyone who's never heard Davis's *Kind of Blue* to give it a spin while high. I believe it's one of the strongest potentiators.

Of course I'd be remiss to not mention the quintessential smack band, Alice in Chains (and Mad Season).
My favorite band of all time are the Drive By Truckers but I don't find them appropriate for this particular activity. I'm also a big classic and alt. country fan, but not many artists in that genre are fitting to listen while high.",1471925198.0

I hate this life.,"This past summer, I struggled with a 6mo heroin habbit. I only snorted. And the bags we got (little lotto tickets) are usually 1/8 of a g. Previously in my posts on opiatesrecovery I stupidly thought they were a gram (noob to the game obviously) Anyway a 1/8 of a bag usually lasted me around 2 days. When I quit (June 10th)  I did a rapid sub taper which worked. I got to 20 somethin days until I fucked up and did another line. Which continued into one line per day for 3 days then I'd stop..and do it again..I was so fuckin motivated to stop. I stupidly threw   out the subs during that 20 something clean period. I didn't even use a half of an 8mg strip. I did about .25 then jumped at  .025..

Anyway onto my point. It's been about 65hrs since I last snorted a line. It was junk. Still felt shitty (I have a head cold and some bronchitis shit goin on). So I guess my last use of actual dope that made me feel a high or pinned my eyes was Wednesday. I've been lazy as shit all weekend, but no rls. Slight diarrhea. Ok sleeping, the cough is what is waking me up. I did take 15mg morphine at 1:45am to sleep a full night. Didn't wake up with diarrhea though, yay for not shitting myself!  Based on this info, and that today I don't feel too horrible. More focused on my stuffy ass nose and cough.. but today I generally feel okay.. I think I may be getting odd lightly..we will say after day 3 and 4 hit. 

The main point of this shit whiny baby post is I WANT to be done. I'm a full time mother, this isn't me. Each person I come in contact with has dope..the opposite of what I want. I had subs on order..they never showed. Quite a bit of money gone..and yesterday a kind stranger from a Website was getting them for me..Yeah he took off with my money. Then blocked my phone number. 

 I've only ever snorted, but my husband is trying to quit an iv habit now, and we're in desperate need for those. I've done a rapid taper, it worked. I see people getting care packages ( I fully realize they are usually clean rigs and nalaxone wnd whatnot) mainly harm reduction kits...but ive seen others.and I am so jealous. I love this community and I cannot find the one thing I know will change everything and dig us out of this hole. Oh and today my husband was fired from his long time job with no explanation (drug use wasn't suspected) but he is our only income.his boss didn't even say the words you're fired. Just some bullshit head games.  We are so beyond fucked. A sub doctor is out of the question because we can't afford the initial visit fee.

You certainly can't (unless you used my neck vein.  which i only reserve for the rarest of occasions BC I dont like having tracks on my fuckin *neck* of all places. Especially if you miss.

After i missed a shot in my Dick once I swore I would never do it again. It looked just like that dudes Dick that was on here a couple of weeks ago. Anyway, once upon a time, I let one of my friends hit me in the fem before and it was like magic how easy he made it seem. He said there's a vein in there as big in diameter as your thumb. But since ive never done it myself, Im hesitant to start digging around in that part of my body looking for a flash. Do you guys have any advice? Does that one get worn out just like the rest of the veins? Is it more dangerous than shooting in any other veins?

I feel like I would save so much time and effort if i knew how to do it.

He gave me a list of authors he'd like books from. Chuck palaniuhk, Christopher Hitchens, Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, or really any book is ok. Other things he might like can be some coffee, noodles, or anything that can keep him busy. You can also send him some money through tigerdeposits.com. 
Letters will be greatly appreciated too! He said he will send some back as soon as he gets some envelopes. 

I myself don't have too much money but I'll send him some playing cards, a note book, a bag of coffee, and a book of games (word search, sudoku etc)

Pm me if you're interested and want his jail address.

If you want to send him books they should be soft cover! Or rip off the hard cover if you want.

Here's a list of do's and dont's. Credit to /u/shittyparty

I just wanted to touch on a subject that I'm curious is unique to me or common amongst the group. Ever since I've become slightly dependent on OxyContin and using about 4-5 times a week, I feel as though I have lost interest in other activities. Spending time with friends just seems like a hassle and they've pointed this out to me. I appear to be bored or uninterested according to some of my close friends. This is frightening to me because even though I acknowledge this, I still have the need to continue to use. I just want to be alone with my drugs and nod out to some tv or video games. I believe if I don't cut down or change my ways I will become full blown addicted to this drug. I love it so much; it is the only drug I have had the desire to do everyday besides marijuana (I don't smoke anymore. 

So, back to my question, has anybody else who uses opiates on a daily basis find themselves isolating from the rest of the world? I have talked to a close friend about this and decided it might be a good idea to start going to meetings and try the 12 step program. My diet and exercise routine in addition to the motivation/drive to make positive choices in my life has extremely dwindled since my daily use has occurred.

  Also got a load of supplies yesterday and had to go to another chemist a mile or so away as my usual chemist has been out of supplies for about a week !! Which has been a pain in the arse as I've had to use the same tool 3 or 4 times and had to use lemon juice to break down the dope as I've not had citric acid sachets . You don't seem to get the same rush using lemon juice . I got Citric acid sachets ,Alcohol swabs , Water amps ,Microfilter syringes that have the filter  built into the cap ,they are really good and make the hit crystal clear and disposable spoons .  http://i.imgur.com/9iKapaW.jpg

  Just had another hit and put a bit on the foil and I'll toot away at that through the day plus it'll stop me from having hit after hit till I nod off . http://i.imgur.com/jzvO3TY.jpg

  Hope everyone is having a good day ! It's a beautiful day here in Scotland which is a rare occurrence !  Hope no one is suffering from lack of funds  and don't do anything stupid to get money .

I never thought I would put effort into trying it but knew myself well enough to know id try it if it came around.  

We got off at the Somerset station and I was harassed to buy perc 10s while walking off the platform. In the first 45 seconds of being there I was hit with several more offers for subs, bars, and works. When I got a chance to take in my surroundings the reality set in that this is normal for a large amount of people. There's a run down looking Chinese place just ahead, and a couple houses down the block a man is playing with his children in a cracked fire hydrant. Prostitutes and dope boys within spitting distance from unwavering grandmothers. There is trash everywhere and the elevated subway blocks out the sun from the street below. 

We continued on the way,  and met a guy who was obviously doing what we were. We figured wed get tourist prices if we bought right at the station so we recruited this man to show us the promised land. Seemed like a cool dude but at this point I was on red alert. The run down businesses that lined the bustling avenue quickly turned into entire blocks of condemned houses... I was a bit hesitant but wasn't about to turn around,  I was sober.

  We continue deeper and I was exposed to more normal things. You can tell the areas that are completely lost from the areas that still have activity by the disturbing amount of rigs on the ground. We walked this street behind a huge graffitied warehouse,  and the normal litter trail of cups and chips bags began to grow thick with discarded needles. A group of boys bike by threateningly close calling out offers for ""hard"". Our escort casually mentions the boy (couldn't be older than 18) was carrying and to be careful, warning that he`d probably have tried to rob us had he not been there as well. Looking back,  Im not sure if that was true, could have just been him trying to earn our trust. We keep walking and arrive at the spot. He tells my friend that the guy is here, and to give him the money. Wisely my friend demands on going with him to grab it. The deal goes off without a hitch,  minus the squad of 7 bike cops that rode through in the middle of it. The boys on the corner start yelling ""hot dog, hot dog"" and scatter.  This was pretty funny looking back... Completely inconspicuous.  We part ways with our guide through the ghetto and count the loot. The stamp was an apple. It was a bag short, Im not totally surprised. My friend wants to stick around and get high but Im a bit less comfortable with the idea of potentially nodding out in an area Im unfamiliar with.

Well, it was quite the exoerience, and really has left me wanting to see more. The dope was horrible, apparently, as I didn't feel anything from a bag. We must have gotten very unlucky because that place is supposed to be the holy grail of heroin.

Just wanted to share my experience since I travelled six days ago to London (and am still here). I took about 2-3gr dope with me right inside my butt and also some syringes and a stew band in my hand luggage. When the guy scanned my hand luggage he zoomed in on something but didn't want me to open it, so I guess it's okay to take syringes with needles on the plane. The body scanner I walked through (like not the metal one but a newer one) that spinned around me didn't notice anything 'inside' me either. I mean I got checked really hard, they typed in my id numbers by hand and held my ID card right to my face + asking me to take of my hat, but everything went well. Not gonna say that you all should do it like that, but since this is a pretty common topic i just wanted to share my experience. The syringes travelled once in my hand luggage and once in the other (the one you have to check in at a counter before checking in yourself).
Flying with drugs + supplies worked like this from an Eu state to Switzerland and from an Eu state to the Uk(another one). 

Since I'm greedy af the amount I had with me wasn't enough and I had to go out and try to score. The Reddit couldn't help me much, unfortunately and Craigslist wasn't any help either; a lot of people insert there (w/copy and paste texts) but if you message them on kik they want you to send them money via Western Union or something similar to a name/address in Cameroon... They're saying that it's just for the first time to be sure you're not a cop and that it's also safe for you because of the code number you're getting from money gram but I didn't do it anyway because it looked to suspicious and weird to me (anyone with experience about this?). 
so yea, I nearly gave up but asked a homeless guy at the station I'm staying  who asked me for change if he knows someone and went off with him + a friend to get some gear without having to pay any extras...

My conclusion/tip for you is: If you want to score in another city ask someone nice and don't give any money to strangers (online) when you don't have any guarantee for it - looks like it's not to hard to get dope for someone if you really wanna get dope for someone...

I obtained a sub script because there was a particular month in which my doctor decided to have me try out fent patches. I hated them - all they did was increase my tolerance. The following month, I wound up going through my oxycodone script rather quickly because my pain was not being relieved by my normal dose. Also, my doctor was not understanding about this situation and said he could not prescribed anymore oxycodone that month. So I panicked and got a suboxone script so that I could still function (got it from a doc who will prescribe subs to anyone type situation). Anyway, fast forward two months, my pharmacy (in california) has rejected my most recent refill attempt of oxycodone because they checked the prescription monitoring database and saw that I had subs prescribed (didn't even use insurance for the subs). So now I have a few questions, and I understand the answers may be dependent on the state you are in. 
(1) Is it part of the pharmacists required protocol to reject filling your script if they see that you were a suboxone patient?
(2) Am i shit out of luck? - I hope not because I am truly in pain due to nerve damage from an accident that I was involved in 10 years ago. And it is not feasible to try to fix it because the procedure could make me paralyzed.

Can any of you relate? (I know some of you can),"I'm a FUCKING DOPE FIEND. Through and through. If D were a woman, i would wife her up. Problem is that for the past couple years ive had this side chick GIRL. I HAVE to have them at the same time. The sex with D *used* to be good enough by itself, like I said, I would *marry* her, but when I'm fuckin D and Girl at the same time? I'm complete. I haven't a want or worry in the world. I know that D doesn't mind when I see Girl. D doesn't mind 3somes. But the thing is that I used to be *in love* with D, and now D hardly gets me off unless Girl is there too. Everything would be fine if I could afford to have 2 girls and pay for all the things they want. But I can't. Its not like I'm falling out of love with D, its just that its getting harder and harder for me to get off unless Girl is there too. I know D still loves me and we will always be there for me but more often than not i just dont feel complete until Girl is there. I dont feel like even bothering.  Now girl? I dont really care for her much by herself. Her personality is shit, tacky taste, constantly over steps her boundaries and yada yada yada, but since I started doing the 3 way thing with me her and D? its *magic* . I can't say it any other way. Like, by herself she can go Fuck herself but when we hook up with D its *phenomenal* . its starting to get to the point where unless im with Girl, I dont even *want* to hook up with D (who I was/am in absolute *love with*). I still do and unfortunately always will love D, but after throwing the Girl into the mix ive just become a selfish prick and D isn't enough for me anymore. If I know that I can *only* hook up with D and I can't find a way to make Girl come along then I dont even want to Fuck almost.  I love D. I *need* D in my life but after seeing how good it is with Girl, D by herself just seems bland and boring and plain. Like I need to take a nap. And girl by herself? Well, I gotta be drunk as FUCK just to deal with her bullshit. I have no feelings for Girl whatsoever it feels like. Its just the way that she interacts with D and having the two of them together in the same room is so phenomenal that I started to see her in a different light, its like yin and yang coming together and sucking my dick while massaging my prostate with the 7 inch tongue of an angel. Its not like im falling out of love with D, that will *never* happen, but its like i dont want to bother hanging out with D u less Girl can come along too. D gives me confidence and energy and power and just generally makes me feel *realky* FUCKING good about myself, the only downside to D is she just makes me feel kinda drowsy/unexcited and ive noticed that once I started seeing girl that I dont feel bored or drowsy at all. I feel even *more* confidence and awesome in every single way except she takes away the boring shit that D gives me. 

Is anyone following me at this point? Does anyone relate? Im not a special little snowflake or anything but the way my life is i *can't* use year round. Only for a few weeks at a time once every few months. So im not strung out to where im willing to kill to get a hit or anything, im just a chronic controlled relapser. I go away for work and be clean for a few months and then I have a relapse for a couple weeks. D *used* to do it for me. Now I feel like I still love D but its just not the same unless Girl can hang with us too. Ya feel? Anyone?


Tldr: I *really* hope someone gets what I was trying to say. I thought about this For a while and this was the best metaphor I could come up with. Im not bored with d, but now that ive been doing 3ways for a couple years the thought of d by herself just seems....bland. Some one please relate. Anyway. Im drunk and I want to talk.

I want to try taking it orally for the first time, just to see what happens. I've searched and searched and everyone says it's a waste. Well, it's not a waste because this is a sample and I can easily get more.

Basically, I have a tolerance to codeine and take around 200-300mg of codeine every second day. However I'm on prozac so it doesn't seem to work as well. Given that heroin is so much easier to get (and cheaper) than other opiates, I want to see if it's a viable alternative. Essentially it's the same process as codeine, if taken orally, some of it is converted into morphine. Hence why it was used in cough medicine in the good old days.

So all I want to know is if there is any way at all I can optimise the oral bioavailability, or if I should just dissolve it in some water and drink it? It should be water soluble as it's china white...

Advice needed...,"My Suboxone doctor is a bit of a moron. I'm not going to make this super lengthy, but he prescribed me Vyvanse (no prior ADHD meds) the very first visit, and I didn't even have to make the suggestion. I was just glad to have found a local doc. 

Anyway. This last appointment, he made a comment that made me get a little bit terrified of the tapering process with this guy. His exact words were: ""You could give your mom a milligram or two of the stuff, she wouldn't even notice. It's all in your head."" This was said in response to my mild complaints in the tapering, just muscle aches and whatnot. I've been on a low dose (~2mg/daily, trying to be more consistent) for almost 3.5 years, so it's been a while. Withdrawal seems foreign to me, and the most mild symptoms set me off. I don't remember ever being this big of a pussy.

What do you guys suggest I do here? I'm well aware that Suboxone withdrawal is not purely psychological, as my doctor would love for me to believe. ""I've had patients just walk away at 4mg. No problems. 2mg is where most walk away."" Great, now you just made me worried you're going to try to push me off the stuff without tapering. The people likely got off the stuff because they were ready personally, not because of him. Dosage probably didn't even matter much. 

It's quite scary that he'd tell me that 1-2mg of Suboxone wouldn't absolutely wreck my mother/anybody without a tolerance. Hugely irresponsible and outright wrong. Way back in the day, even I could get wrecked from Suboxone. This showed me he has absolutely *no clue* what he's doing prescribing this drug. And even better, he's essentially the only doctor within an hour of me. I'm not looking to travel to Chicago for my monthly meetings because of this guy's idiocy. 

What can I show him to make him realize he's a moron/completely wrong? Any help is greatly appreciated.

I was also captain of my football team and the only freshman to start on varsity.    i was accepted to georgia tech without even trying.   When i got into college my parents lost our home we built with our own hands after my dads custom home construction and bbq buisiness both       failed in a period of months.   They moved to where i was born but not raised in nebraska . I started to do opiates and stopped  going to class while i had a 4.0 gpa to work to pay for my habit and my rent.  I married a russian girl for $10000 so she could gain citizenship.  I od'd on tramadol and took a flight to nebraska and got clean.   I got a great job contracting at directtv.  I was clean for over a year,making great money,great credit,my own house.  I relapsed and destroyed it all.  I started shooting heroin when i tried to help a family friend, who i had known since i was sick and lived with me and my family during highschool because his mom was insane, who was also an addict.  2 and a half years of all my money going ro dope destroying my credit and my relationships.   I finally told my parents and tried to get clean but never could.  I kept shooting heroin and lying and pretending i was fine.  One night i mixed benzos and a shot and totales my moms car by nodding off and smashing a light pole at 50mph.  I also od'd in my house and walked into my younger sisters room but naked after hallucinating at as close to unconsciousness as you can get and getting lost in my bathroom.  I moved back to georgia to try to fix myself but instantly found a connect and relapsed.  I lived with my pregnant cousin and her husband paying no rent lying and saying i was saving money for a truck.   My vehicle now is currently being looked for, for reposession for 7 months.    I got pulled over one night for being buzzed with no registration, no insurance, and a expired id.   I blew .07 and drove home.  Georgia tows your truck when you dont have insurance.  I moved in with my aunt and uncle after it was discovered i was using again by a savvy cousin.     Ive been on suboxone for 7 weeks illicitly.  My family knows  im on suboxone but not that i still use occasionally.   I work construction and serve tables.    My parents moved back here after losing work in nebraska.

How did your score go today?,"I'm new to posting on this sub, but I had something happen today that I thought you guys could definitely relate to and I don't have a lot of using friends so I got no one else to tell. Sorry in advance for the long post I'm high and there's a bit of back story. TL:DR at bottom

So normally to score I go through this one guy let's call him J. We used to use together back in the day and then I got clean for a bit, but recently we reconnected and he's been hooking me up with hydromorph contins (my DOC).

Back when I first met J we all grabbed together through T, who was the middle man, and one of my close buddies. The price for a 30 MG hydro was 30-35$ depending.

Fast forward and me and T had a falling out and he swore never to supply me again. I had just got on methadone and took the opportunity to clean myself up a bit. 

It's been two years since I went on methadone and a few months ago I was looking to get high so I hit up J because I didn't think T would answer. J tells me that prices have gone up and its now 55$ each and that the minimum I gotta buy is 4. So 220$ every time I wanna grab. I've got no choice, J knows me and T had a falling out and that I have no other options. The city I live in is way too small for an open air market and ordering from the DNM is risky given my living situation.

So J goes on about this new connect he's got and the guy is pretty good. He's reliable, quick and fairly local so at first I suck it up about the pricing. J is careful to never let me meet the guy though. Even though I'm sure that J is ripping me off, not just in the price, the hydro comes in beads and he's been taking beads out of the capsules before he gives them to me.

Anyway this weekend I hear from T unexpectedly and we get to talking about the old days and I ask if he can still get. He surprisingly says yeah and asks if I'll be ready in an hour. So T comes to pick me up with his roommate and sure enough turns out its J's new connect, L. We get to talking a bit on the ride and the guy is pretty chill and he tells me that sells the pills for 40$. So J is ripping me 60$ every time I grab... We grab and as their dropping me off L says if you ever need just go through T. I'm not cool with that because I think this was a one time thing from T. 

Today J says he's gonna be in town later and asks if I wanna grab. I say yeah, but I want to do them for 50$ (giving him some incentive) he says nah the guy is running low so there 55$. I know it's bullshit but I wanna get high so I agree. J's phone doesn't work so once we meet up he uses mine to call and text L. L shows up J goes over and the deal goes down. L spots me and as soon as J walks away I get a text. 
It's from L asking if it's my number. He then says fuck J just hit me up if you need.

So now I'm sitting at home, high as fuck off my shot of hydromorphone and no longer having to deal with a shaddy middle man. Life is pretty good right now. 

TL:DR Used to grab through a middle who way over charged, through a random turn of events I met his connect and now I can just go to him directly.

I had just gotten kicked out of a program for homeless youth in Boston, Ma, where I am from. Kicked out for using. I had been on methadone for 8 months and could not stay sober for longer than 3 months. I was involved in AA but just could not shake the occasional relapse. 

 That day (8/23/16) i took enough benzos to forget the sad life i had found myself living. I also took enough benzos to forget the fact that I didnt want to go to treatment. The detox i had called in an effort to placate my mother (with no intention of going) called while I was getting high and said they had a bed and would come pick me up. For some reason I said yes. I had 2000$ saved up and in my normal (non benzod) opiate lifestyle i would never go to detox with money.

I went to detox, got clear headed, and took suggestions of people i trusted in AA / treatment etc.

I havent used since then. 

at 5 months sober, life happened and i was arrested and extradited on a fugitive from justice warrant in South Carolina. Spent 2 months in jail. Stayed sober through that and now I am out happily living in the Charleston SC area.

My life is actually amazing today. I dont think about getting high all the time and i treat myself and others well..

This post is not meant to brag or make people feel bad or anything. The point of this post is to say that if you are hopeless and willing to change, you can do it. If you are tired of being broke / homeless / disappointed in  yourself etc, you can deal with all that.

I love you guys and appreciate this forum so much for showing support and keeping me alive when i was active with positivity, harm reduction, inspiration, and laughs.

If you are gonna use, do so safely, and if you wanna stop, there are a million people who are willing to help you.

If anyone ever needs an ear or someone to talk to, advice about treatment etc please reach out to me..

Love yall <3 ",1471992182.0

I already got a ton going on: my mom in a psyche ward, afraid to go home to my grandmas cause all she does is put me down, holler and scream about nothing. And nobody at home respects me, the fact I have to do homeschool with no privacy or my belongings (the little I have) in the basement, because I have no room to lock my door and my possessions in that house. I had so many beautiful clothes & shoes that everyone else is now wearing; I have to sleep next to a grown man who wakes me up at all hours of the night, ect, ect... You get the point of what's going on at home. 

Then I get a ride to see my mother up at the psyche ward & she's doing a lil better, off methadone completely, but she has no where to go except for a shelter when she leaves.. & on the ride up there, my cousins ask me why I was mumbling, shutting my eyes frequently a little noddy (their on methadone and Adderall).. And I told them for the 9th time that ""I took my boredom pills, my Percocet"" and they ask me why and I get called an asshole, and I told them that I'm bored I have nothing to do with my life right now.. ""Oh that's not the reason why"" making a joke out of me at this point. What else do they want from me. I have absolutely no support at all from family.. I see a psychiatrist and therapist... Only so far that goes.. But my visit with my mom was okay.. Gets me very, very sad & devastates me to see her like this in a psyche ward on psyche meds... I already lost my pops two years ago. Just so much going on in my life & on my mind..

But instead of taking a subway home, I walked 30 blocks.. And along the way I stopped in 3 stores asking if they're hiring, what advice they can give me to increase my chances of being hired, ect... This is a big step for me because I deal with horrible social anxiety.. Everything I want to do in life, I don't follow through because of this social anxiety.. I have a really strong head on my shoulders I've been told and I sure am a dreamer with many great ideas, thoughts and goals for life.. But this anxiety debilitates me... But I will never stop pushing forward..

I have had drug problems honestly since I was 14, but it didn't get ""real"" till last march when I started doing meth,heroin, and xanax. No one was going to tell me differrnt about trying heroin I had to try it myself. I knew the addiction potential or at least I thought I understood it but damn if the shit doesn't sneak up on you so quick. 

Meth and xanax were easy to quit, but heroin is on my mind every day. Its effects are exactly what I want out a drug.  I still don't have physical withdrawl symptoms but I'm definitely mentally addicted at this point, and my tine between use is getting shorter and shorter. I always buy it off the darknet so I can never really escape away from my source. I can't tell my family about any of it because then I would be homeless and not get any financial help for school. I know they love and care about me deeply, but we all know the stigma heroin has.

I don't really know why I am making this post I'm not here to get pity I just needed to tell somebody. Hell,  I  even joined my schools rotc program to help force me to stay clean, but I'm still using.  I lift and run everday, but that doesn't help with the cravings at all.  I know stuff like this gets posted thousands of times but I just don't knoe anymore if I don't straighten up my life will turn to shit. Sorry for the ramble and grammar errors I wrote this on my phone straight from my head. Thanks all and be safe. 

TLDR. Im fucking up and I know what the obvious answer is, but it seems either too hard or I'm just a pussy honestly and have no self discipline.  I've never been any in sort of legal trouble or been caught as I'm not stupid about where I use and no one knows about my use. I have been nearly caught a couple times though and the thought of breaking my mothers heart breaks mine as well. I'm scared. ",1471985143.0

&nbsp;&nbsp;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; I have collected about 2 grams of opium so far and will likely harvest about that much til the pods stop bleeding when scored. I then plan on making tea with the pods then evaporating that to get flaked opium. Combining all that I should get between 4-6 grams raw opium to work with.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  Now I could just react the opium with the GAA(glacial acetic acid) which I think is what the cartels do to make tar. The reason I don't like that idea is that the GAA also reacts with many of the other opiates present in opium. The thing I want to prevent is the injection on any underacted codeine in the final product.   
Ingredients:   
5 grams raw opium   
Calcium Hydroxide(slaked lime)  
sodium carbonate(baking soda)
Ammonium Chloride  
Glacial Acetic Acid(GAA)  
pH testing strips  
pyrex glassware  
separation funnel

Using 5 grams I will dissolve in purified water until right before boiling occurs, then turn off heat.  
Slowly stir in calcium hydroxide(slaked lime) til the solution reaches a pH between 10-11.   
While the solution is still heated add ammounium chloride til a pH between 8-9 is reached. Allow to cool.  
Once cooled morphine base(calcium morphinate) precipitates out of the solution. Decant the remaining solution and dry the morphine base.   
There will still be an excess of a few other chemicals but they will be at negligible amounts.  In a container that has a lit the morphine base is dissolved by adding small amounts of GAA(glacial acetic acid) until fully dissolved. Cover the solution and place on low heat for 30 mins. Make sure solution doesn't boil.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  If I did everything correctly I should have 6-MAM adulterated with some 3-MAM unreacted morphine and unreacted codeine.    
Add a small amount of water and dissolve the product.Add sodium carbonate until a pH of 11 is reached, the 6-MAM will precipitate out.    
Decant the solution and dry the product.  I plan on first snorting a small amount to test. I then plan on IVing a small amount to check my kitchen chemistry experiment(I don't want to hear about how dangerous it may be, I know what I'm doing, I know the risk).   
&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  I estimate that from 5 grams of opium will yield 0.5 grams morphine which in turn will yield about 0.2 grams of 6-MAM, and since it is 30% more potent than diamorphine 0.2 grams is comparable to 0.3 grams of diamorphine. I only get one dose for all my trouble but really this is more about testing my chemistry knowledge and ability.

Juneau, the state Capitol, was shocking in that it is so damn small and remote. However, it is a city.. A city with a huge homeless problem and in a state where the average annual income is $75K a year. Not only that, but the population drops like in half when the summer ends. The money is there, the boredom and drive to use is there, and the market seems untouched. While I'm sure that bud and cocaine would be popular with tourists from the cruise liners and the workers on the ship (roughly 6K visit each day and never come back again), I imagine that those markets have likely been touched.. Although crime is extremely low, leading to a huge police presence that would likely be on your ass, any kid who could smuggle a package or two into town would be able to make a killing. Cruise ships have security but no dogs that I know of, so that or taking boats into town would make it relatively easy to get drugs in.

Another user replied, and told me that saying IV Morphine is shitty is just like saying that IV Heroin is shitty, because the majority of people would not be able to tell the difference if you had them do a blind test.

So my question is for all the experienced H users out there (IV users only please, also please have experience with IV Morphine as well) do you guys feel the rush/high/euphoria is so close to Morphine that you wouldn't even be able to tell the difference?

I have only IVed dope maybe 15 times total..but I never ever have once thought ""hey this is exactly like Morphine!""  If that was the case, I would have never used it again, and wouldn't be jealous of all you guys that get cheap ECP up there.

They were loading me with iv dilaudid the entire time I was in the ICU so I suffered no withdrawals. The doctor sent me home with a script for percs and with being the addict I am, I took all of those (only 10 10s).

Did They Give a Shit?,"Amidst this whole fent epidemic I've been thinking of all the different ways it can really play out. I'd imagine that many street level dealers don't really give a fuck about the real differences between fent and good dope, they just hear that it's stronger and stronger always =  better. The guys high up the ladder that are actually doing the cutting are insulated enough from the whole process to not have to deal with the real fallout from it. 

But I could also see a few dealers being smart enough to understand that their customers don't want the fent since it's got no legs, euphoria, yadda yadda yadda. Also, since fent brings bodies, bodies bring the feds. The more this shit happens, the more dealers are gonna be catching cases for manslaughter or homicide, in addition to charges for selling dope. As much as this goes against my libertarian principles, I could see it driving the fent cut dope down if it were to happen enough. Getting popped selling dope is bad enough without a  body thrown on top of it. 

But even if someone wants to just the real deal, where the fuck are they gonna go? I'm not naive enough to think Jose is gonna listen to him when he asks him for ten zips, hold the fent. Fent is literally all you can get in some parts of the country right now, and he's got a whole burner full of customers calling him 24/7, most of whom will really do **anything** if they're sick and or desperate enough. 

Final question: if you've found your dude to be selling fent (and they don't use), did you tell them? Did they give a shit? I'm not naive enough to think most of them would really care. They hear junkies complain about product all the time. How do you see this whole thing playing out? ",1472138884.0

Precipitated withdrawal is caused when you take a dose of bupe and it knocks a full agonist off your receptors, causing an instant reduction in receptor activity, that part I think is fairly straightforward and accepted by all. If you wait until you are in withdrawal before dosing, there won't be any full agonist to knock off, so no precipitated withdrawal. 


But, if you were to wait a few hours after your last dose, and then take the suboxone 1/2mg at a time, spacing it out every two hours or so, wouldn't that allow it to gradually fill your receptors as the full agonist wears off?  Then if it any point one of the 1/2mg doses makes you feel worse, you can either wait it out if its not that bad, or do a little dope and at that low of a dose it should be able to stop the PW. Eventually, once you've taken around 4-6mgs, you should have enough bupe on your system that you can then wait until the next day, and take the next dose like normal.

Due to the fact that fentanyl analogues really are killing people all over, and it's making headlines quite a bit recently, it makes sense.  But why is it that people don't see that this is a result of being tougher on heroin and legal prescription painkillers?  

[There is a story on /r/politics that hit the front page today](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/4zd8tt/idiot_wasserman_schultz_says_legal_pot_is_to/)

The comments section in there shows me that people really believe that doctors will just prescribe opiates to anyone who walks in, and that those people are at high risk for becoming addicts, when we know that almost the exact opposite is true.   I think the inevitable legalization of pot will leave a large hole in the DEA's budget, and that they plan to fill by convincing Americans that we now need more oversight on opiates, because heroin.  

If opiates continue to be demonized like this, we'll be lucky to be given tramadol after back surgery, because the doctors will be too scared to lose their license.  This is going to create larger demand on the black market, which will lead to more heroin users, and more deaths (and more arrests, and more propaganda about how the problem is getting worse).  

It seems to me cheap, legal, regulated opiates given with a ""know the risks"" lecture from a doctor would reduce the number of opiate-related deaths, not increase it.  Can someone logic check me here?

What experiences sculpted you? Did your locale play a hand in who you are? What people were you around for development? What environment did you come up in? What environment made you who you are *today*? ""Where do *you* come from?"", not ""*where* do you come from?"". Of course, also asking why?

Well, update. I got caught by a nurse! The repurcussions were HARSH and mentally, i almost didnt make it thru the 7 more weeks i had to do. No cell, no visits. Oh ya they 302ed so i couldnt leave lol. Go ahead.. tell me i deserve alllllll that shit. And u know what? I would say THANK U FOR BELIEVING I DESERVE TO BE SAVED. I know my other posts came off as snobby amd unapologetic, getting me zero sympathy amd a ton of hate especially surrounding the fact that i have a beautiful perfect two year old little girl. I wanted to die... i didnt care about my life i literally laid in bed wishing i could just die. Getting caught and 302/303ed really sucked but i got the meds i desprately needed to save my heart, i have been clean a couple months from IV drugs, although i still snort dope here and there (im not perfect, i still am depressed and its the only thing that keeps me going) but im gunna have to get clean any day now cause im gunna finally step and face off with my babys dad to a formal custody agreement so i can be the mom she deserves.. he refuses to let me see or talk to her currently because he is controlling (i recently passed a piss test for him, he doesnt think im using and i dont get dope sick so as long as i go in a few days, i think my vhances are good because i really want my baby girl in my life) i dont wamt custody yet, i want whats best for her which if im being honest, i think we should do supervised, pre scheduled visits along with random drug tests. Then work my way up to more responsibilty. He wont even amswer my calls now tho so im gunna call a lawyer first thing tomorrow morning and get the ball rolling. Dont get me wrong, im still so sad, lonely, hurting on the inside that sometumes i still wish i would just die. The difference now is that i think of my daughter, my family, my friends, amd how hirt they would be if i took the cowards way out. Its so hard but i just try not to be selfish. I figured that if i cant find it in me to live life for me, then ill just live life for everything and everyone else.. then work on my internal struggles after i wake up alive everyday and take my meds, shower, brush my teeth and eat. Those things sound like duhhhh a normal wake up routine.. but depression fucks u up in the way that u dont care about shit. Ive gone weeks without brushing my teeth... i know, im ashamed to admit it cause thats trifling but i was wayyyyyy too deeper into depression to give a flying fuck. I could do meth and go a good 4/5 days no food and barely enough water to fill a pop bottle cap before i could get low enough to even care. I was so close to death fuck, i really was driving myself straight into the ground and not caring. I feel terrible everyone i love and that loves me had to suffer with me but im feeling good about recovery this time. I dont feel pressured, i WANT this. I dont feel like im runnng from the pain and sadness, but more like im saying its ok to feel this stuff and it sucks but its no excuse to commit slow suicide.. i feel like im terrified to actually go into groups or one on one therapy to crack open my past (ive never really dpne it before... all my other rehabs i kept myself closed off). Im gunna open up, accept this experience, and keep my eye on the prize... the day im finally reunited with the most perfect angel, my ""GG"" as we have nicknamed her. Please pray for me if thats ur thing, keep me in ur thoughts or whatever. This place has always been one of the only safe havens i had during my addiction.. i knew u guys would be the one group where i could pour my heart out asking for advice and get actual, good advice from knowledgable people.. even if i got hated on. I needed the honesty, not to be patronized and have things sugarcoated. I got told to quit being a selfish bitch amd change my life for my kid and i needed to fucking hear it... had i not, maybe i wouldnt have been able to make it to this point today. So thank u guys, it means soo damn much to know i can throw my feelings out here and get some really well thought out comments back. Ive been so fed up once before too, i was ready to give up and take that easy way out but i swear to god, i came on here for one of the first real times and devoured EVERYTHING for days straight.

TOPIC: If one were involved in the sale of something to an individual that results in someone's death...    
- How likely/often do they pursue the person who sold it? Even if person is merely a middle man...        
- Do they commonly go over phone records in overdose deaths to find potential sources of the person who sold the killer cocktail?    
- Do they usually only target person who sold the H, or would they target the person who sold the person the benzo, or both, if it was that combination that resulted in death.   
    
Any other useful information? He doesn't know if the kid is dead yet, but it's a strong possibility.

Of course they tried to end it as a cliffhanger, but when you're in the game, you know thats unrealistic.

Fast forward seven months after moving, and I find myself with an extremely small social circle and I spend most of my time by myself. I get extremely lonely, so I use heroin to numb my emotions. However, I feel like dope is limiting my ability to step out of my comfort zone and socialize with other people. I have tried to detox and take a break, but the isolation and boredom that hits me on the weekends and weeknights is too much and I always end up going back to using.

I usually only get half into the vein and the rest goes in the surrounding area because the needle slides a lot when I'm fidgeting with it to push down the plunger and it usually loses the vein especially when I loosen the tie. But today, I think I got the whole thing into a very thick vein, and so maybe there's more bioavailability, and that's why heroin was so strong even though I only used the same amount as I usually do. 

I think that had I not taken the meth there, I would have likely overdosed for real. But anyway, I got the usual opiates nausea. I got up, walked a few paces, and then I puked. The freaky thing was that there was this swirl of blood in it, and when I spat, there was more blood. But it was not spread uniformly in the vomit. It was like speckles and this streak. 


Have any of you ever heard of puking blood in a mild overdose? I searched for it, but I don't see any stories. I'm hoping that it's probably something unrelated like maybe snorting so much drugs caused me to get a nosebleed, and when I nod, I tilt my head up to nod, so blood dripped to around my throat and that was what showed up.

I don't know any other place where I can openly say my life nearly revolves around it. The first thing I think about in the morning is do I have a dose to begin the day?

And honestly I don't ever picture a life off of opiates. I don't think I could live clean. I've never experienced being a clean adult. Who am I even? I was 16 when I picked up my first pill because I nearly had my damn leg ripped off. I know I fucked it up with decisions and now I feel stuck.

I tried to explain to him this is not effective at all for pain if the only time it works is when you are sleeping..also he has kidney problems as it is. I'm wondering if his doctor is stupid as fuck or maybe i'm just over thinking it.. but taking 14-16,000mg gabapentin DAILY for 3-4 years can not be good for your organs - or am i wrong? Also if there are any other amputees around.. is there any medicine you've taken that has helped out with phantom nerve pain? Feel bad for him he's been having these pains for atleast 6-7 years now and he also complains of burning.. edit: they gave him 100 5mg roxies for 2 months before.. 3 or 4 a day I think it was.. he said they did absoloutely nothing. I told him to tell them he needed something stronger but he opted to just double down on his gabapentin cuz they atleast put him to sleep. (these numbers are rough but from what i've gathered hes taking anywhere from 14,000 up to 19,000mg a day.. I pick these up for him it's literally 6-7 giant bottles of gabapentin",1472216915.0

Seeing this makes me feel sick. Never really was a fan of benzos. I always end up passed the fuck out in someone elses bed. Gives me the willys just thinkin about it. Edit; sorry to shit on your thread.  First time i popped 2 bars with a buddy of mine who also hadnt taken benzos. Two seems like a good number right? I mean, if i at the time was taking 6-8 norcos or 4 blues, then what could 2 bars do to me? Big mistake. Somehow i drove my car to another friend of ours house. He had this cool little apartment below his parents.

 Now i dont recall why we did it because by then my alter ego(zahd) had completely taken ahold of me, but for some reason we(zahd +bt) kicked down his( jb) door. We get inside and of course no ones home.. i dont really know what happened after that. So about 16 hours later i finally wake up and im in jbs bed wearing nothing but my birthday suit and mr JB just got home. I can tell from the 2 warning shots he popped off. I look around trying to get my bearings and some whits about me.

The apartment looked like someone has taken a small nuclear bomb and detonated that shit in there. Then a hurricane blew threw carrying some every colored shit. Everything was broken. Tv, cabinets, dresser, holes in the wall ,couch shreddded, etc.. on top of that was melted ice cream, chocolate syrup ,beer  ,whipped cream and it lookded like anything else slippery we could find  ended up litterally everywhere including all over us. 

From what i could tell is that we made a slip and slide from one end of the apartment to the other with the landing zone jbs bed.  I was in denial that i could have done someshit like that. But the proof was in the pudding haha. Jb comes in gun loaded until he sees me then he was surprisingly a good sport about it after about 30 min. It took us 30min just to find bt. Wearing only a snorkel to breathe underneathe a pile of shit. All i could think about is how the fuck did this happen? Needless to say me + benzos = _%//$^! €=€&#(¥. If only that was my only experience with benzos id be ok.  Ive got a dozen other stories similar to this one. lHmm well if i didnt like 2 bars maybe ill like 2 kolonopins....Nope, maybe if i try the  footballs? 


Sorry for the long ass shit post guys. 

P.s. never tell the rehab or detox your at that your dependent on benzos if you are in fact not dependent. My buddy advised me to so that i could get prescribed a benzos. They wouldnt give me subs but they gave me phenobarbital. Holy fucking shit thats a story for another time.",1472211150.0

I did side by side tests with the same amount of d, same water etc. But one of the spoons got some citric powder. A couple seconds of heat after the stir helped too.  The sample with the citric dissolved better, much better.  Instead of a nasty brown thick chalky looking substance, it was now a clearish amber color looking much more appetizing. I also think i got a better hit and rush of the citric one. But that could be in my head.

I've been helping out a junkie friend of mine who recently got kicked out of his house as well. Now I'm not using, but I felt horrible for my friend and his girlfriend. Well today was fucking crazy.

First off, I've talked about this couple before in a previous story post on here. Needless to say they're good friends of mine. Now the girlfriend is a bit of a fiend and a crazy bitch (that's putting it lightly). Because the guy was my friend I held back from saying anything about her ridiculous behavior, but it just eventually blew the fuck up. For example, this girl will constantly ask to hit a cigarette, pipe, tooter (smoking heroin off tin foil), etc. And when she doesn't get her way she asks again and again and eventually just takes it. And when she gets the pipe or whatever she hits it over and over, sometimes as much as 6 consecutive hits which is EXTREMELY annoying.

Well today I met up with them to help them use my connects to get them well. Through out the day the lady was complaining and being a total nuisance. After a few stops we met up with a plug who had been pretty liberal with his dope by giving her like 2 fat ass shots (IV) and that kinda sounded off as shit. We dropped her off at this guy's place and then met them at the gas station because we needed to withdraw some money. We then met up and finished our runs for the day. Ladyfriend really wanted to go to the dollar store. 

We arrived at the parking lot and she pulls out one of these shots and basically starts forcing (or trying to) the guy to try and IV it for her. She always IV's it herself so idk why she wanted him to do it. Anyways he had just done a shot of cottons  (she lied and swore she had no dope so my friend had to use her cottons  ) so the guy was feeling pretty queasy (he doesn't IV ever so just a bit was enough to make him feel kinda sick). Now when he said he wasn't going to she started flipping out. Saying we only do what he wants to do and never what she wants (which is bullshit, we always do everything for her). So eventually my friend just stopped his car and threw her shit on the ground, said ""get the fuck out, go suck (insert plugs name here) dick for your dope you whore."" 

Obviously I'm just sitting there speechless in the back, but we came to find out she'd been cheating on him and sucking off a few different plugs for dope that she was shooting up behind his back. My poor friend was pissed, especially after he had dealt with her bullshit for 2 years. Sorry for the long post it was just something I never thought would happen. 

Tl;dr :  friend got tired of ladyfriend going behind his back and sucking/fucking for dope. Kicked her out of his car and didn't look back.",1472187505.0

We were talking for a bit before dope came up. Anyway I try it about 15 minutes later, it was salt. Salt. He must've put some vinegar in it cause it smelled right. Rip a bag and taste salt dripping down my throat. Then one of my actual connects, albeit middle man, calls back. So I get another batch of real shit. Which is actually pretty good, better than last. So I'm just gonna chalk it up as a loss, paying 2x a bag , anything to soften the blow. What did I learn? Keep focused, don't lose sight of the mission. Always get a test first and don't rush things. My mind Just went haywire when I saw the bags. Junkie brain fart. Oh well, payday is tomorrow and I should get my food stamps tomorrow or Monday so I'll recoup the losy money, just stings a bit.

 Oxy being my doc for the last 10 years. I have definitely seen the dark side, Ive had my binges with dope, tried blasting even and didnt like it much more so always went back to oxy. but I have always managed to climb out before being really fucked(dont think ive gone more than 3-4 months daily straight before going to rehab that time). But it seems my game lately is get super fucked up a day to 3 days(def have gone more lately), feel a little shitty, maybe take a sub for a day(only if Ive over done it and gone 3+ days), start to feel better, then repeat the fucking cycle all the time telling myself Im done.
I almost always go back out of boredom and habit. Im sure the answer is the same for all of you, its quit or fucking dont, not much in between although I like to pretend there is....

I'm past acute withdrawals, which was honestly the biggest thing I wanted to break away from. 

Here's where I'm stuck. My entire family is super proud that I've actually cleaned up and that I'm not using anymore. I feel guilty because I don't, by any means, plan on abstaining. But, at the same time I don't want to let everyone down. 

I'm planning a trip to another, less restrictive country where I can get a 90 day prescription for methadone to bring back with me. With that said, (let's get this out of the waY) id just want them around just in case. Because in my opinion that's ""better"" than going to score and slamming more dope. 

Is the thought of getting the script just junkie me needing a pacifier there? Or is there actually some merit? Methadone would be under the control of a close relative to try and keep them from being abused


Tl;dr: was high, got clean, loved ones really proud, still wanna get high, don't wanna disappoint, but maybe methadone? Thoughts?",1472160712.0

I am back living in State A now and have received scripts for controlled drugs since, but not opiates.

So, I am 18 years old. I started doing opiates when I was 15, and that started with Hydrocodone when I used to take it from my grandmother. I was doing it a few times a week at the most, started taking only 15-20mg and got reallyy high, then I started to have to take up to 40mg, then up to around 70-100mg along with xanax, and this was all at 15. 

Around when I was 16, I started doing oxycontin, this was amazing. I started just taking small amounts of it orally, until I learned snorting is a better option. That was BREATHTAKING for me. 

Anyways, throughout the next two years, I was doing opiates on & off, either once a week, once every other week, and sometimes once a month. I started doing Tramadol also, and then I finally found Opana. When I first started doing it, I could snort less than half of a 5mg pill, and be FUCKED up. Since then, I haven't been doing opiates THAT much, but i got Opana whenever I did do opiates. 

I took a few month break from opiates/opioids since it seemed like my tolerance was getting a little higher. Then, I started doing them again, but this time, I needed more. Which was strange, since I took a tolerance break. I then tried heroin in college when I was first turning 18, and I couldn't even get high on that. I was trying to do oxycontin too, snorted 90mg, nothing.

This was very strange to me. I know I have a history with opiates, but never was I taking it frequently enough to make my tolerance this fucked. Even now, I snort 4-5 bags of H, and I get a SMALL buzz. I try to do 30-40mg Opana, even SMALLER buzz. I can't even touch any other kinds of opiates/opioids. 
(the only time I got high af on any opiates/opioids was one time doing 3 bags of H, but they were probably laced with some shit because I was slurring my words bad & couldn't walk that well..)

I just really want to know why I cannot get high on opiates anymore. It's sad, it just seems like I really lost the magic in it, since I started so early in life. I was wondering if you guys could give me any input or any information regarding tolerance issues. 

Thank you!!",1472144386.0

One doctor treated me like a person and took my complaints of pain seriously and on a neurological examination found that I suffered an ischemic spinal cord injury from compression of major blood vessels to the spinal cord. Part of my spinal cord is dead from lack of oxygen and my left leg has half the strength of my right. The nerves in the surrounding area are still able to send a pain signal to my brain which explains the severe pain I had.

He gave me a referral to a pain management doctor, filled out the form for a handicapped license plate for me and offered to help me get disability for the injury (since I can't work) He treated me with respect and believed me when I said I never did it to get high, that I was in pain.

Edit: Here's my daily hygeine:

Wake up. Shower. Use conditioner everyday, and shampoo when my hair gets too greasy. Use an oil eliminating facewash and a body wash everyday. I get out, brush my teeth, floss em, scrape my tongue, and wash my mouth out with an alcohol free mouthwash. 

I clip my finger and toe nails once every couple of weeks. Sometimes I use this weird green face mask that is cold but burns. It's amazing. I've never tried it on drugs I really need to.

I hate to see posts where a member has passed away, and it effects me just like finding out that a distant family member has passed away, even if I never really knew them, or talked to them much... yet I still feel really sorrowful about it. So please, follow the harm reduction guidelines to the best of your ability, do test shots, read the fent warnings from here, the TV news (I know TV  news is pure bullshit but at least the reports of fent deaths, or even just large numbers of ODs centralized to one area within a short time period, is generally credible. Also listen to the shit within the local drug scene. And the most important thing (in my opinion), is to use with someone who has narcan, or at least use with someone who isn't a piece of shit who'll leave you for dead after looting your dying body. Even if the 'shot sitter' (like a trip sitter heh) doesn't have narcan, they can call 911.  But make sure you can give them a location if necessary, since with cellphones, they can't get the address from when you call, just a rough estimate (unlike when you call from a landline, they'll always get your address from the billing info... and yeah I got this info from the Last Week Tonight segment on the 911 system and how fucked it is).

Jesus fuck this already off-topic post got even more off topic towards the end. I think it's because recently I heard of a friend of a friend of a friend fatally ODing. I only spoke with him a few times, but I could tell he was pretty smart, and one of those people where others would go 'you do dope!?!!?! I can't believe it, I can't imagine you injecting drugs, you're too smart for that, etc'... so with this on my mind, I wanna try to prevent deaths by sharing info at the very least, and hopefully in the future, doing more to prevent deaths as well as infections, diseases, injuries, etc. Dope use can cause a PLETHORA of other medical problems... a lot of which you'd never  imagine that doing dope could cause that.

**So yeah I'll end this novel of a post with one final remark: **If you got a MMJ card, can you give me some tips to make sure the process goes well? I have severe generalized and social anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, and panic disorder. My psych said ""you have the most severe conditions I've ever seen"" (and he has decades of experience working as both a general adult psychiatrist, an addiction specialist, and child psychiatry too. And btw, and I obv paraphrased what he said, since I can't remember *exactly* what he said, but the gist of it was what I wrote in quotes). From everything I've read and all the research I've done, it's clear that an indica or indica dominant hybrid strain of cannabis would help best for my anxiety.** 

**I'm not just trying to make shit up since that wouldn't really be possible (well possible? yes, easy? no.) since they need the medical records from the doc. treating your condition(s) that you want medical cannabis for to be faxed over to them. I'm a little worried since my psych doc. is an arrogant prick and I'm pretty sure he's brainwashed by the propaganda of the 1930's and beyond lmao. Now delta9 claimed that I don't like need his permission necessary, since I'd most likely just call my doc's office, and have one of their employees fax over my records to the number I give them, so it's not guaranteed that my doc will even know about it.

I was just wondering this as recently I got my first ever OxyContin (being European can suck) which took about 40mgs insufflated before I hit a sweet spot. 

The only other Opiate I use is Dihydrocodeine which I get for one week per month.

Question about smoking heroin,"So I just started smoking heroin this week and I picked up a gram recently. Yesterday I smoked for the first time and snorted it a little and felt great! But today I smoked it again much more than yesterday and feel fairly close to being sober! Still the same gear, smoking method etc but even more gear today! Also the way we smoked it was by melting the h into a small puddle then once it was melted he would dip his finger in a little bit of water and spread the puddle across the foil. He would then light along the foil from one end to the puddle while I chased the smoke. Is this an effective way of chasing the dragon? Also why do I feel almost nothing today?",1472302795.0

I aquired some 20 mg instant release oxycodone pills from a darknet vendor. Me and my friends have had a handful very beautiful experiences with Tramadol, so it's safe to say we were excited. We eat some raw ginger to deal with potential nausea.

We each swallow 1 pill. I hadn't eaten for about 6 hours, apart from a yoghurt. My friends smoke some weed, I stay ""sober"" cause I want to experience what oxy feels like, saving the weed for when I wanna nod.

2 hours in we feel a general ""chillnes"", but not a whole lot. We smoke a couple of joints, and decide to take a little walk. On the way we smoked a couple of cigs, bought some milkshakes and went home.

About 4 hours in, we smoke more weed, and get pretty ""heavy"" and slow. I pinch myself and I feel close to no pain at all, but there is very little euphoria and absolutely no hints of a nod.

Feeling pretty tired, I snuggle up under some blankets and fall asleep. We wake up after a good rest, all pretty underwhelmed with the experience. My question is, why didn't it kick in harder? 20 mg is a pretty solid beginner dose, especially when my our only opioid experiences prior to this was with codeine and tramadol. Could it be extended release?

TL;DR: took 20 mg oxy, felt very little high, what happened? ;--(

The floating kind made of my mistakes on a river made of the tears of my father and mother. Still never really cared about consequences lived all over the u.s. - Jails - o.d.s - 6 rehabs. All the normal bad shit that happens to Junkies. But for the first time ever I had gotten clean like for almost a year with no replacements like methadone or subs I went to AAI didn't smoke weed or drink and was seriously trying to find a path man. I got sober by just shuting the fuck up and not arguing so much for once just listening to everything someone said and not trying to do shit my way. I didn't even have to go to detox or rehab this time I came off a two year hard run of meth and dope and was just fucking done But.... I got high eventually. I entered this deep depression like I was sober I didn't want to get high anymore but I wanted to kill myself out of the blue for several weeks I thought about how I could do it all the while still going to 12 meeting a weeks waking up at 4:30 am and going to work and still can't even afford to buy a pack of Newport's and a fucking slim Jim with a sponsor telling me I'm on my way to relapse cause I'm fucking some girl with 2 years clean suffocating me so bad.. So naturally I shot some dope. Sent me in a little baby run and to a little detox. Later on now if I'm honest with myself I feel I fabricated this wanting to kill myself just cause deep down I needed an excuse to shoot dope again. But a therapist Dosent agree for the first time in 7 years I've been shooting dope I started at 13 I'm now looking into my mental health as well as trying to work on my addiction stuff. I always just thought I was a junky and there was no way out. But this psychiatrist tells me I'm a manic depressive or some shit and wants to put me on meds I really haven't started and I'm weary to take psych meds but my addiction ain't as bad lately I kicked the dope again and had like 15 days I was starting to feel better but I did some heroin tonight. And shot some crack. My addiction to fly fishing is going to save me from this heroin thing..  When im our in the river I don't think about anything but ""this is the cast where I catch that huge rainbow"" I don't think about my life in shambles or how the fact that I haven't even had a legal drink of beer and I already shoot dope in my neck. But I'm just really high and rambeling. But I love this subreddit. And I hope everyone is well. I really wish everyone the best.

Cyclobenzaprine, Dantrolene, Metaxalone, Methocarbamol,  and, Tizanidine are all no recreational. So, unless you are prescribed Carisoprodol, Diazepam, or baclofen.

4zzl5a,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/4zzl5a/my_life_story_with_addiction_so_far/,8,https://redd.it/4zzl5a,warfare33,My life story with addiction so far,"Excuse me for writing a quick cursory essay that I felt like writing while on amphetamine. I was curious about letting my thoughts out and to see what it would be like describing addiction from beginning to end, from my own life, as well explaining the general circumstances we addicts / or even drug users come to or already have faced. 


Addiction is too personal of a form of life experience that requires beyond the user’s own self-realizations to make sense of the chaos and potential heaven and hell that can be the state of addiction. All addicts will follow certain paths in their lives that may or may not lead to similar “breaking points” that are simply one of more crucial moments upon which a true recovery can be made with the user himself being prepared to face the task at hand with a true diligence previously unavailable. Moreover, to even discuss these sorts of topics can certainly be complicated by the basis of the idea that statistically, it’s fair to assume that, the majority of addicts suffer not from just one mental disease but perhaps one, two, or even some more diseases that were either always existent within the addict, exacerbated by drug usage, or formed in one other manner over time nonetheless. This requires the addict to first decide which is to be fixed. The drug addiction? Or the mental health / lifestyle problems?  


Most health experts I imagine would say that to start with the drug addiction would perhaps be at the root or core of the issues at hand needing to be figured out to the point where a strong minded recovery can shatter the already pre-occurring thought patterns and habits involved with the seeking and using of drugs. Some people simply reach some a nasty point whatever it may be, which simply acts as a powerful mirror on the addict to once again decide what is he going to do next. Some recover. Then relapse. Others recover. For life. Some recover and even end up overdosing months later to their family’s and friends’ surprises. It is unclear what the path to recovery can be like. Once again, it depends on how powerfully the individual is able to hijack the “drug addiction” eating away at their brain’s psychological needs. 


For me myself, I have neither reached this “nasty point” yet but neither have I wanted to even consider stopping using. I’m in between right now, definitely leaning on the side of “X amount of Years will hypothetically lead/not lead to the utter failure of myself in regards to responsibilities, social/family relationships, the keeping of touch of my emotions and mental health, and the enjoyment of actively engaging in other hobbies living in that true moment to moment basis of living all of us aspire to achieve”. At the same time, I currently don’t believe that circumstances will permit to reach such a “nasty point” but I will not disregard the fact that everyone doesn’t know when theirs is coming so the same could be same for me. Accessibility / Price are pretty simple in terms of being the main things preventing me from being in a state of overblown withdrawal syndrome coming off uppers and downers all the time and just in general suffering the loss of a soul through repeated “pleasure hijacking”. I’m an addict but functional to a certain degree, a degree which is overwhelmingly negative. I plan to change that although I know my habits of usage are likely to remain the same. So essentially what I picture is I actually truthfully doing the things required of me on time and studying substantially more while maintaining the same level of usage. It’s a shit plan but just a general guideline I think can/will happen.  


I started smoking weed 2 years ago. I liked it too much. Way too much. I tried to hide my love of it for a few weeks and months so I ended up only getting to smoke once/twice a week for a few months to my distaste. I wanted MORE. Of course, these times, before abuse, were undoubtedly the best highs ever. In the innocent sense moreso I suppose. I return to spring semester with excitement knowing that I can finally smoke everyday after having acquired finally my own vaporizer and a steady connect for the weed. Even that, itself, was funny to watch the progress from daily to more than daily and beyond that. I think I lasted like two – three weeks doing it every night to avoid this thing called “tolerance”. Then before I know it, I was doing it whenever man. 


Wake up? Vape. Take a shower. Vape. Go to class. Eat. Come back to my room. Vape. Go to class. Vape. Come back to room. Vape…… until 3 am. Repeat daily for months. 
Then amphetamines arrived. I only did like a few those year I think. I didn’t experience the high the first few times and just thought of it as bunk in the sense of the expectations I had for it. Sophomore year fall semester, amphetamines taught me what the fuck they were about. I felt GOOD. This was a different type of GOOD feeling compared to smoking weed. Smoking weed with it made me even more heavenly. I did this maybe a few times a week every month with the premise of me having gotten those pills to study. No… I masturbated, listened to music, talked online, THEN finally at the comedown began to study. I was too sleepy man. I felt horrible. No way I could study.


Enter benzos. My friend hooks me up with his script and Xanax kills those stim comedowns like no other. As for the drug class itself, I was still very new to it. I knew they weren’t that great but could be good mixed with other depressants. 


Enter LSD. This was close to end of the fall semester. This changed my entire opinion on everything and changed me as a person greatly. I’m not entirely sure if I can place the loss of my suicidal desires as the result of that first trip or not but it certainly made me realize the best thing to be realized. That depression is a massive fucking illusion that the mind is playing on you. You are you. The mind is you. So theres certainly more going on there but what’s evident is that in that state of awareness during that acid trip, I was able to like everyone says, take a look outside of the box, and realize that maybe my future wouldn’t have to be endlessly full of failure/sufferings/misery/depression/no hope or chance of anything going right. I was happy for a while. I tripped a few more times with me now at 7 total trips ever done. The 1st and 2nd trip were honestly the real shit in terms of what I got out of it. The times after those trips were more recreational and any negative feelings were tossed aside by a delusional me convincing myself that “everything would turn out alright” when I wasn’t sure at all if that was the case, given recent circumstances at the time. 

I return to Spring semester sophomore year and me and my friend smoke everyday. We drink a lot and take benzos with them. Sometimes I myself would have Adderall in the mix. It didn’t matter anymore. As long as there were drugs, it would all be good. Those basic combos lasted for weeks and weeks, and the both of us were doing alright in school but much worse than in the past given that we were hardcore spending much more time getting high / getting wasted than before in the past. I was using more and more to hide the sad feelings of being alone and feeling like no one truly would care for me or ever care for me or that I lost hope in life a long time ago so nothing matters besides seeking these chemical pleasures. 


Finally, opiates. These are the most dangerous (for me). We get some excellent Heroin #4 to sniff from the onions. This shit feels so good man. I didn’t know what to use to describe the entire experience. My friend himself had actually hidden his Heroin use from me the past year since he was worried I would label him a junkie as most non drug users / some drug users would be liable to. I was pretty surprised. 

Rules? They started off being don’t smoke this often. I didn’t give a shit about that. I smoked whenever I wanted. Next? No Meth, Heroin, or Crack. No snorting. No smoking cigarettes. I eventually snorted the 30 IR my roommate was insistent on me trying out given his quirk of enjoying watching the reaction of users to different experiences. It wasn’t really a rush. I learned that I would only take Oral Amphetamine/Methylphenidate from that point on. Heroin was the biggest surprise at the end. I really didn’t foresee my friend using that stuff. I forgot how I reacted but I initially thought “wow cool, I need to try this”. Some part of me was mainly concerned with how doses work / how to sniff the right amount of dope/ how to not overdose but that stuff changes real quick. He shows me that a small bump is all it takes to get you up and high and flying for hours. A stimulant-esque rush while feeling comfortably sedated at the start. You feel so nice man. It’s not that overwhelming. Over hours, you gently feel less pleasurable to the point where there is no end, but just a calm relaxed demeanor that can best describe, for me personally, the complete lack of an Opiate comedown. Neither did I vomit or experience physical side effects from the Heroin. It was PERFECT. I snorted that every fucking day until I finished the bag and didn’t care much for the fact that it was over but now months later, i am…. In this state of feeling of desiring this substance once again more than ever. Constant access of this product is not an option given that my friend only gets it from the onions whenever he so desires. But what turned out to be for sure was that Heroin IS/WAS/CAN BE Drug of Choice. 


Right now, it’s the summer before Junior year. I stayed up all night today and took some addies to feel better since the klonopins weren’t enough to push me to sleep the previous night. I’m more depressed than ever. I’m apathetic but have contradictory thoughts and opinions all the time. I’m more aware of my addiction and my issues but its pretty easy to just use the drugs and get my pleasure while maintaining a bare minimum effort for the tasks required of me. I could maybe someday turn out dysfunctional. I could turn out being addicted to a multitude of substances with physical dependence involved. I don’t know. Anything could happen. 


I have lots of acid for the first time. I can trip a lot. Tripping a lot is interesting since this changes the equation. Forcing myself to think about all this stuff I mentioned above while tripping could simply be a worth experiment for the sake of getting the inner peace I need. I also will be rolling on MDMA for the first time next week so I’m hoping that this roll will help me out with social anxiety in some permanent way that some individuals are able to get away. Drugs aren’t the cure but they certainly can help and most especially these drugs, they aren’t too bad I imagine. My mind is honestly making much less sense than I expected. Not sleeping really does fuck up amphetamines ability to have an effect. I increased the dose and it did nothing. I’m actually feeling the weight of my eye lids regardless as well. I’m focused and stimulated but its not the fun type that I was looking for. I’m going to go to my first NA meeting when I return to school in a week. I have / had no one to talk to for days on ends to months on ends sometimes excluding extremely brief dialogue with parents and gym/restaurant employees. I expected myself being able to write my story in a much more relatable and flow-y manner but now I feel like this is all shit lol. Anyways this will be something to look back to in the past I guess. 

I desperately want to solve my lifestyle / depression / anxiety issues yet I usually do nothing while sober and don’t care while using drugs. I want to use drugs. I don’t believe I’m that capable of achieving the things I would want. There must’ve been a reason why for the last 20 years of life, I was unable to just have one person to call as a close friend, have a steady group of young minded individuals my age to hang out with on regular, have hobbies to add aspects to my life. Since starting drugs, I defined myself as drugs and just existed as drugs for drugs. They feel pretty good. Some of them make me do work better. It’s a constant circle jerk of pros and cons. OBJECTIVELY? I think most/all of us could say that being clean would be the supreme way of dealing with life .. right? But still no I’m ( right now ) in attitude of wanting to do drugs. I’ll see what NA is all about so hopefully that pans out well. Otherwise, I’ve had 3 past shitty therapists that really weren’t helpful. Why is it so hard to find someone to talk to? I suck at expressing and express a lot when crying while feeling beyond horrible or while high or drunk. Here’s just a basis half assed summary of the last 2 years of my life in addiction basically if anyone cares to read. after glancing over this a few times, it seems like i am a very weak individual. mentally, in regards to stopping addiction. mentally, in regards to wanting to do the things that are good for me. there is a major problem with my thought process. NA and better therapy should be hopefully one good thing to exist.
The scariest feeling of them all that powers the core rationalization of my drug abuse/addiction is this very HEAVY feeling/belief that since having always been an abnormal child and that its likely (even if i try to learn how to socialize / learn this or that/ get this experience), ill still be abnormal.


i have this fantasy of meeting fuckups like myself and fucking up with them in ways in life. having a solid group core of friends would make a HUGE difference for me. if i were capable of getting a relationship with a girl, that would help EVEN MORE. for me personally those things are valued enough to the point where it would be a major trigger to actually desire to calm down with drugs, not completely stop, but just kind of slow down. ive never been able to do do things like that. i have always just been this isolated kid that was never horrible neither skilled enough to happen to meet friends that click with me. im afraid of social interaction in general in the first place. fuck this adderall is doing the complete opposite of making me forget about suffering. i want to take more later on today but i doubt it will be euphoric. some man at a family friend party yesterday asked me if I was a MAN after my mom told about the ways I still behave like a child, which is true. I answered Yes but do not feel like a man whatsoever. I'm a socially anxious depression drug addicted low esteem low self confidence lonely incapable young guy. thats what i think i am.",1472394443.0

Of course, it's fucking slammed because, well, it's noon on saturday in a major-ish city so I say fuck it and go to the motel.

It wasn't just up the road either. The short of it was that it was like 5 miles up the road, through about 2,317 lights, bumper to bumper.
Fortunately, she was quick about it in walmart. We go to McDonalds, finally, and by now it's like 3:30. Her friend gets off at 4 and has some  40s on her and I can have half of one (big deal) if I wait it out with her until her friend gets off.

Ok, in the interests of cutting this thing short, I drove my connect to walmart, McDonalds, her house, a coffee joint, a payless shoe store, did a fucking COKE deal, and ended up locked out of the motel she was staying at because it wasn't even hers.

Successful cold copping story in the EU.,"I have been on amazing Eurotrip the past two months. I got clean right before I left for the trip and today I arrive in a new city and as I am going through the metro I see the guy smoking crack right in the train central station. 

I ask him for H and he can't understand me because he speaks Italian. Anyway he says follow me. As we are walking I clarify I'm looking for H and he says I don't have it but do u like subutex. YES! He grabs it out of his pocket and asks for 20euros. As I go to atm. He says he can get methadone. And we run through the central station and there are hundreds of dealers yelling at me in French. Anyway this guy gets me 6 40mg capsules that are in a blister pack. Each one 10 Euros.

Now I'm happy because 
1. I realized my tolerance is basically zero, and I went on reddit and researched that with no tolerance you should take 10to20mg max.  Because I'm in a hostel there was no way for me to find a place to dose out the done. 

2. I decided to play it safe and take 1.5 mg  of subs (easy to break, unlike the capsules of methadone). I'm high as fuck right now. Not nodding but feeling great no pain, soar throat is now gone! Fellow reddittors always take less even though we want more.

3. I didn't get ripped off. Yes the guy over charged me a bit but if I took the chance on H it could have been shit quality.

4. Because I have no tolerance both opiates are super euphoric. 

So that's my first successful cold copping story for Opis. It's easy in each major city for weed but almost no cities I visited had Opis. The other time I got sold bunk and lost 50 euros for fake H.

 My question is what do u guys think I should dose for the methadone tomorrow? I think the dones will still work because of the low dose 1.5mg of sub ? Also I'm planning on  site seeing so I don't want to nod to much on the dones. 

Anyway happy nods on this beautiful day.",1472333665.0

Longtime lurker, waiting for the right time for a first post. That day has finally come. My friend Robert (Rob) used to love to lurk this forum with me when we were high. He never created an account, but whenever he came over he was always excited to read all the hilarious, crazy, and sometimes depressing shit you people post.

Rob left this world last night, succumbing to brain cancer after a long and valiant fight. He never lost his humor, his wit, or his soul. Rob accepted his death before it came, and found a dark ironic humor that he would die by cancer rather than by the needle. He was 26. 

Fun fact: Rob actually preferred his birth name, Robert, over Rob. (especially after Game of Thrones came out) He went by Rob for one reason and one reason only: his last name was Paulson. Rob was able to find humor in everything, except his name/fight club references. One night a couple months ago, however, browsing through r/opiatesmemorial, he made the first and only fight club joke I'll ever hear him tell; ""How funny would it be if you posted an obituary for me here and all these fuckers said 'His name was Robert Paulson.'""

It's worth the read, incredibly moving.","As with most people who end up trying either of these drugs, The 'Basics' came first, or the type of drug got harder as time went on, or as I'd tried all the others, or something. I must say, though, that I'd wanted to try all drugs, even Heroin and Coke, when I was about 15. Not right then, but at some time in my life. The only anomaly in the 'normal' dope, acid, speed, coke, smack line came when I stole some morphine and pethidine from my mum at 15. She is a doctor, and a friend and I had some at my then girlfriend's house(!) She broke up with me the next day, and I was so upset that I smashed all the rest of the ampoules, and didn't really think about it much until I was 18. I had a bad trip at 18 which nearly killed me. I had taked about 50-60 trips before this, but on this night had been drinking, taking speed and smoking pot, then had 1/2 a tab. I flipped out and ended up breaking into a gun store in an attempt to commit suicide, and was hauled out by 2 armed, guns drawn police officers, after pointing the shotgun I was wielding at one and telling him 'You're fucking dead'.

After hospital, where my Dad is still a prominant doctor, and I was hauled screaming at the top of my lungs through casualty, I was at a bit of a loss. I wanted to take drugs, with my friends, and be 'cool', but certainly wasn't keen for more psychedelics. The answer arrived in the form of morphine. Where I live, there isn't much heroin (restricted to an older hardcore, and v. small individual shipments (a few g's - an oz), so the most commonly abused opiod is morphine tablets, mixed up and whacked up.

Anyway, my friend, who was dealing a lot of pot, gave me this morph, and I loved it - though there was the answer to the 'coolness' problem too. I never got a habit on morph, but by the time next year came around, I had used a fair bit. Then off to Sydney for Uni. I had heard that you could buy Heroin off the street there, and within about a fortnight, I was off to cabramatta, to buy my first 'cap of many. I tried it, loved it, and for the next few months, went out to score a few caps of the vietnamese every fortnight or so.

I really wanted to find a local dealer though. It was a 2-3 hr train ride out to cabra and back, and I knew that the nearby suburbs were packed with smack if you knew where to find it. Finally I did, in the form of an old punk couple, who lived in a flat at the back of a barely functional store in a basically silent road, in a quiet area. I felt a lot better going there to score that the harshness of doing deals on the street in Cabra, even if the value was a little less. By the end of that year, when I went home for the holidays, I hadn't really had a habit, but now had a serious girlfriend, and was doing well at Uni.

It's amazing in retrospect how long it took me to really fuck up my life. I survived second year, although by the end of the year, I'd had plenty of habits, and was really in the 'binge and crash' cycle. I'd survived a few serious OD's, been revived by Narcain and Ambulance once, and my parent's knew I was using smack, as one night, I had scored a quarter oz ($2100) for a friend, and made a gram or so for myself, which was a lot, at the time. After taking heaps, I woke up after basically passing out and had a bit of trouble breathing. I drank some water, then started coughing, went to the sink, and coughed up some blood. then some more blood, then vomited heaps of digested blood, and coughed up more blood. So I called the ambulance, and spent a week or so there. They are not really sure why it happened, it could have been cardiopulmonary oedema (fluid on the lungs), or aspiration pneumonia (breathing in my own vomit).

I left college after second year, which was really the honeymoon period with smack. I didn't rip people off, I even made money by doing the occasional big deal, and didn't use enough to have to stop my Science degree, and I was totally in love with my girlfriend, who used occasionally, but was a bit wary of the path I was taking.

Third year the shit started to happen. I lived with two of my best friends for the first 9 months. I was starting to scam my parents and friends, sell or hock my stuff, borrow and steal to get dope, and I basically got hooked. I moved back to college with my girlfriend in about september, and stayed there, I moved in having been 'given' my old dealers business, after he was busted. He asked if I wanted to take it on. Of course I did, and I knew my flatmates wouldn't stand me dealing, so I worked it so I was dealing there for 1 day when I moved back to college, with about 20 regular customers! I must have been totally crazy to think I'd get away with that, as college is a VERY close community. I only lasted about three weeks dealing, as I just used too much of my stock myself. So I wnt from a $100 a day to a $500 a day habit, with no other gain, except a warning from the head of college that I was a suspected dealer and user.

I somehow struggled through a month or so until the end of year party, when my friend Tom came over. I had been best friends with Tom since I was about 7. In the past 2 years, he'd moved to Sydney and go work in the Computer industry. He and I had used drugs together since each of us started taking anything, and as he earned $40-60,000 a year, he came round on fridays and bout enough smack for both of us. Well this friday, I'd already had 2 $50 caps, and was just feeling OK enough to go to the party. Tom called me, so I told him to come over. These parties involve the drinking of heaps of kegs of beer and basic running amok of the whole college, so we started drinking, then hooked up with the man (by now I had delivery connections) and bought a quarter (gram). We had also dropped, then shot up, a few valium each, and drunk a shitload, after having a hit of some of the smack.

A lot later, ater drinking continously in the meantime, we stopped by to have the rest of the smack. Feeling fine, partying on, and as usual, talking the sort of crap to each other that only a 15 year friendship brings. We had the dope, and I nodded off. I woke up and Tom was dead. i knew as soon as I saw his grey face that this was true, but I'd revived him in the past, so tried to now. It didn't work. The ambulance confirmed it. I remember giving him mouth-to-mouth and hearing a gurgling in his lungs. He'd been sitting on the bed, leaning against the wall, and had spewedbeer and breathed it in, drowning from an OD of Smack. We used to joke about Harry Scagnetti, a fictional mafia dealer, who sold the 'killer' smack. It seemed Tom finally met him.

The death of my best friend fucked me up, but it's not an excuse for what happened, I was already going down the path, Tom dying probably just pushed me further and faster down it. After that, I used as much and as often as possible to block it out, which worked at first. After a few months, I had lived in, and been kicked out of two houses I roomed in, with complete strangers, after stealing their money and posessions to buy smack. My friends were wary, and my girlfriend, who I still respect and care for, even if she doesn't speak to me, broke up with me after her family took me in to stay there after I had no-where else, and after ODing at 3am on a wednesday night, and waking the house up being revived, I stole from them too. Her mother's jewelry and her brother and father's camera's (a favourite of mine, the police asked me later whether eight (the number of different ones I'd pawned) cameras was a lot to own!). I finally ended up in a flat by myself, but at least by now I had really good dealers, who delivered, and sold the strongest and biggest caps I'd ever seen.

To this point, Harry had cost me tens of thousands of dollars (around $100 - $150 000 to my count), the trust of my friends and some friendships, the trust of my parents, a relationship which I cared for uncountably much, and the life of my best friend. A pretty bad brother by any definition.
I just kept on using though. My parents had been so good to me, they'd put me through four hospital detoxes and a ten thousand dollar six week detox in Melbourne. I'd forged checks worth about ten thousand, and had even rung their bank manager and convinced him to transfer thousands to my account, pretending to be my father. Being doctors, they were on the ball with medical knowledge too, although my Dad put it well when he said he now knew more about heroin than he ever wanted to! They took me home again, in a third attempt to get me started on naltrexone, the opiod antagonist/blocker, which had emerged as a 'wonder cure' again. Take it, and you can't get high (true, it feel like you're shooting water, VERY frustrating). The trouble is, it lowers your tolerence back to how you were before you'd ever tried smack.

They sent me back to Syndey after 1 week, of my 'easter break', although I hadn't been to Uni for months. I scored on the way back from the airport, but about a week later, I'd taken some serapax to help me sleep while on the naltrexone, as it gave me jitters (horrible stuff, really), and had a hit of smack. I woke up on the floor, where I'd slid from the bed 3-6 hours earlier, but I couldn't move my left leg. I thought it was just pins and needles, but I really couldn't move it. It really started to hurt, and I had to get the ambulance men to bring the police and knock the door open to get me. I had been lying kneeling/leaning against the bed, with my right knee pressing all my weight on my left leg, for 3-6 hours, and the muscles had started to die, my kidneys to fail, and in less than another hour I would have had a heart attack and died. After six weeks in hospital, most of which was just a haze of pain, I could walk again.

5 years later I'm home and on methadone, but almost ready to get off. I've left out the six months of smack and coke use that came after hospital, where they convinced me to get on the methadone program. Shooting coke cut through methadone, but in six months, I was worse into the coke than five years of smack, and got myself a six month suspended sentence and three year probation as well, but that's another story.

Why I'm still alive, I don't know, or only God knows, if you prefer. I can't say I would never take those drugs, if I had the time again, but I would do anything to bring Tom back, only I can't. I'm now addicted to methadone, and about 30kg overweight, with no girlfriend and no best friend. I have councelling with my Doctor, who in the 30 or so people I saw in legitimate attempts to end my drug addiction, is the best, every week. I finished my science degree, and I'm still alive, but it has been a big price for the time I spent with Harry.

Went to a giant national park/forest today & it just reminds me over & over about who I really am sober: boring, scaredy cat, beta male.. & the déjà vu of a repeated result with absolutely little to no improvement in 4 years. 

I feel like I have no purpose in stopping. I haven't had sex in over a year either. I finally had sex with my friend who's 30/f (milf); this would have never happened sober. I've tried for the 3-4 years I've known her with absolutely no success being sober. This is with any girl. This kinda stuff reminds me over & over *& over*, *why stop if all it's doing is helping?*. It's not fucking me up economically, physically, ect. ect. My sober self is much, much worse & the overall quality of my life has been drastically improved on the Percocet throughout these months/year. Like a diabetic has to take his insulin every day or a schizophrenic has to take their Anti-psychotics to be functional, what's the difference between using this Percocet as my as needed medication than using the Xanax & Adderall I get, which is much worse for the body than opiates.

Edit: I'm just trying to be the best, loving, assertive & perfect possible person that I can possibly be. I've always had trouble achieving this sober. My younger self just played video games all day, day dreaming. I dropped the video games but I'm still a day dreamer of who I am & what my gut instincts are telling me to do.. but I can never follow through. The Percocet lets me follow through with those ""daydreams"": they become *livable*.

I also come from two socially anxious parents who did drugs to cope as well. My dad had horrible social anxiety growing up & had a head injury in his late 30's.. The doctor told him he'd have problems down the road from that head injury & those problems resembled schizophrenia.. I just remember being a 13 year old boy bringing my dad to the mental hospital every other week.. Sticking my finger down his throat so he can breathe while he was having a seizure from his benzo withdrawal and the 100mg methadone cold turkey he went through for months.. But whenever he took a Percocet too, all of those ""mental"" problems of the ""schizophrenic like symptoms"" he had magically went away. It was hard to talk to him because he was always zoned out.. but I remember giving him a Perc 5mg & I took 10mg (I was 15 at the time, I only used these rarely, I was a weed smoker more or so) & we just sat on the hard tile floor & talked for hours..

Didn't ever come up. I just ate some potatoes and feel a little better. Hopefully it's wearing off.

I've come up against hard spots and ultimatums before. But this time, it all comes at once. I back a company truck into something in front of my boss...twice.  A spoon falls out of my pocket while visiting my dad. I nod out on my mother's couch at 2:30 in the afternoon. The wife notices my paycheck deposits getting smaller and smaller. So, pretty much everyone I care about has had their suspicions confirmed in the last two weeks, and all sent the same message : Not Again. Clean up or fuck off. 

Fast forward to today, day three of a nasty kick. A big middling opportunity comes up. Well , obviously, I ""need the money"", even though I know what's going to happen. And of course, I decide that I would be ""too sick to work tomorrow"" unless I picked up. And then I naturally slammed a 0.4 shot, because junkies gonna junk. 

So, back to square one. Since I wasted my opportunity to handle it over a long weekend, I picked up enough subs for a fast taper, so I can be somewhat functional. And I take another run at it. Surely one of these times, it will stick...

We are currently in the Fentanyl Era boys and girls. Here are the eras of the past:

**The Oxycodone Era**: 1996-2010.. 2010 marked the ending of an era, because 2010 was when OxyContin was reformulated to the abuse-resistant 'OP' brand. Yes, roxi 30’s became more widespread, but basically within 1-2 years after the OC re-formulation, prices started skyrocketing to $25-30 for a single 30 mg pill. Addicts were no longer able to pay the insane prices, which leads us to:

**The Heroin Era**: 2010-2015... With the increased supply/availability of purer Mexican heroin and the decreased supply of pills, heroin use skyrocketed during this time period. This is when everyone started making the change from Pills --> Heroin. Good luck finding an Oxycodone-Only addict in 2016. The kids, they all went to heroin. Every last one of them. Little Timmy is now shooting up heroin in the McDonalds parking lot. However, in 2015, we got hit with a new epidemic…a new era that no one could have seen coming:

**The Fentanyl Era**: - 2015-Present. I firmly believe that within the next 1-2 years, fent (which for this post refers to Fent and/or Fent Analogues) will be in everything. It will be a rarity to find ECP without at least a little bit of fent in it. You have to remember that these fucking scumbag piece of shit dealers are making unbelievable profit margins by dosing their weak bags with fent. It's just too profitable for them to put it in there.

Think of it this way: 1 Kilogram of fent could make hundreds of thousands of doses of heroin. 1 kilogram of fent will have a profit margin 1000 times greater than 1 kilogram of heroin. The dealers know this, and this is why they are putting god damn CARFENTA-FUCKING-NYL in our bags. ELEPHANT TRANQUILIZER.

Furthermore, dealers are just starting to learn how to volumetrically dose these fentanyl POISON bags, but killing us in the process. We are their guinea pigs. Once they figure out how to safely dose it... good lord folks...Fent will be in EVERYTHING. You are kidding yourself if you think this is not coming. What’s even worse is I don’t see a way back into just heroin. Once again, I think the greed of the drug dealers will outweigh any sense of decency and human compassion towards addicts. The profit margins and money to be made is too great for Fentanyl. Why would a dealer go back to just selling heroin, when they have already got a taste for how much money can be made by passing off their Fent POISON as heroin? 

The only real possibility I can see of getting rid of Chinese-made Fent Analogues, is similar to how the Chinese eliminated the MXE supply. MXE is a very hard drug to find these days, and I think if the Chinese government imposes the same restrictions on Fentanyl precursors as they did for MXE precursors, the supply of fent will dry up, and HOPEFULLY no other assholes will try and take over the supply of fent. 

But long story short, I think the fentanyl era is here to stay folks. I think it’s going to get much, much worse before it gets better. Dealers are just starting to find out how profitable it is. Soon, fent=laced heroin will be the norm, not the exception. Brace yourselves for death after death, all due to the POISON of Fentanyl and its analogues. God save us all.

My friends downstairs (who I know are aware of my addiction issues, but they just think that it's pills and xanax, and don't really say anything about it) hear Ashley screaming ""everybody knows you shouldn't do FUCKING HEROIN.

I didn't wanna open up to my friends about this because none of them are hard drug users, none of them believed when I told them that addiction is a disease, and now I have to decide between being dishonest about clean time (and losing my friends), being honest about if I relapse (and losing my friends), or just distancing myself altogether so I don't end up being asked any more questions like this, and inevitably getting high again on the regular (due to my absence of support). I mean I appreciate what they did, but it's frustrating when people are barking shit at you that don't know what they're talking about.

I remember so much of that day; my dad is not a cabinet member or any kinda position that would ever make him a direct target as an American; ""taking him out"" would make 0 impact on the success (or failure) of al Qaeda. 

Also, remember when we were all so scared of al Qaeda...

Anyway. My dad was in DC at the time, and kids from all over my high school, as a result of our city's economic bases, had parents all over the country, a couple of my middle eastern friends had family in a lower Manhattan neighborhood. My friend's dad was at the World Trade Center for some kinda negotiations with a financial firm or something, and I'll never forget 6th period that day; I was in geometry when I heard Kim jones (not real name by any means ofc) was wailing and sobbing, being led slowly down the hall as she had learned her dad was on one of the floors caught on fire in the initial impacts and was assumed dead unless found otherwise

That day was horrible for so many other reasons, although tbh I've forgotten every single item except for the World Trade Center for some reasons that may be pretty obvious

TL:DR- my best friend from growing up and myself declared at the end of school that ""Tuesday's suck."" - not only cuz of the planes but many other things also... Our motto for years was either ""Tuesday's suck"" on Tuesday's and ""at least it's not Tuesday"" on other days seeming unpleasant.

Mom. 

That does it then. When he gets off at the same station, I hand him my unused box of Valium. It is my Rx but I already told my doctor I was abusing them (and opiates) from time to time and that I did not want any more. The guy is obviously overjoyed, and I talk to him for a while over a cig before telling him to take care and continuing my way home.

Of course I was also enabling these people, but they weren't going to quit today or tomorrow. Plus I feel pretty fucking good now and am going to enjoy my last dose of oxy before reducing my usage for a while.

Me (& my buddy Narcan) saved a life :),"My girl relapsed and decided to go back to treatment before she went too far back down the rabbit hole.. She went to do ""one last shot"" on our way out the door.. Her tolerance was still really low and I saw how dark the shot was and begged her to do less or at least inject slowly (hoping she would nod before she could finish the shot).. She said she would go slowly but once she flagged, she just slammed it home.. Immediately, she looked at me with panic and said ""Babe, I did way too much"".. I've never seen someone OD so fast.. She instantly turned blue and started fighting to breathe.. I was so scared and went into fight or flight mode.. I tried to catch her fall but she fell btwn the toilet and counter top creating a pretzel of herself and simultaneously busting her head wide open.. I pulled her out of the corner, laid her out and tried to revive her every way I knew how.. I was shaking her, slapping her, rubbing her chest with my fist, pouring water on her face, screaming her name.. Not even an inkling of a response.. Her eyes were open but nobody was home and it made it that much more frightening.. I realized she had massively overdosed and began to accept the fact that my soulmate was probably going to die in my arms before paramedics could arrive.. As I held her with tears in my eyes, cursing heroin's name, I suddenly remembered I had narcan in my bookbag!!! Maybe there's hope after all I thought.. I had two doses so I hit her thigh with one and waited a few seconds to see if it brought her back.. Still no response so I administered the second dose.. I got these really cool premade narcan shots that you simply press against the area of injection and hold for five seconds (they even talk to you).. After TWO shots of narcan, still no response.. Although, I did start feeling a pulse.. In the midst of all this chaos, blood and water everywhere from me throwing it in her face, I had somehow dialed 911 and could hear them arriving at the apartment.. Suddenly, she took a huge gasp of air and became responsive.. Of course, the paramedics arrived as soon as she came to but I was glad they were there just incase she needed further medical attention.. I'm so grateful she's still alive and survived with just a new set of stitches and some bruises.. I went to the needle exchange and thanked them with a few cups of Starbucks

So, drugs all have their shared effect- they get you high. Unfortunately for us, most of them have some big side effects. Weed and psychedelics impair memory, opiates constipate you, coke makes you want to do more coke, etc. We all know the little things that come along with our habits. So tell me /r/opiates, what's your least favorite side effect of your drug use? 

Is it a physical side effect like muscle spasms or constipation? Is it a mental one like decreased/increased appetite or decreased/increased sex drive? Is it the physical/mental dependency? Is it the friends and family that tell you to quit? Is it the experiences and troubles that come with the game? Is it the lack of money? Is it the things you do for money? For all of the above, why?

Most of us already know what we don't like about our drugs, so I think we'll have an easy enough time answering this one.

If I sent you a link you a non profit near you and you are having no luck, now is the time to shoot me your address for the next shipment out. Again, donations are urged as this entire operation is, as of now, completely run out of pocket. Funds are gone.

EDIT 3: I gave an example of a $10 donation as this covers the cost of a flat rate priority shipping box. All harm reduction supplies (including the intramuscular syringes used to inject the narcan) I pay for out of pocket or with the little donations I receive. A donation is NOT mandatory, but greatly appreciated to keep this thing going. PM me if you need credentials, as said before kids can vouch.

EDIT 2: if I send you a link with a list of resources to check out first, these are local nonprofits who supply Naloxone. I am in no way shoo-ing anyone away. I must conserve supplies for those in states and cities with zero access first. I am not turning you away, just giving you a better option as you may have you wait longer than those who have no access at all.

EDIT: be sure to check out http://harmreduction.org/our-resources/ on the lower right hand module you will see a blue search box entitled ""Overdose Prevention Programs"" , type in your area/zip code to locate other Narcan suppliers near you, as they can probably get it to you quicker than I can. First priority are people living in an area with no access to Narcan.

If you have PM'ed me...it may take a bit for me to get back to you, my inbox is flooded and I have to process each request. NOTE: if you are in a state where it is legal to buy syringes over the counter, and they're not having any luck at the pharmacies, go to the pharmacy and pick up a box of lancets. They cost about 2 or 3 dollars a box, then go to the pharmacy and ask for a box of 29 gauge half inch syringes. The combination of the purchase of lancets and syringes will give you better luck and being able to purchase syringes. Also, if you buy a pair of cheap scrubs, weae those into the store, you would be surprised how many people will think you are a medical professional and will easily let you purchase syringes over the counter.
You do not have to use sterile water to shoot up, I recommend buying a gallon of distilled water at Walmart for $0.88. This is perfectly fine to use.




I run a non-profit in Texas which assists people in acquiring Narcan. A law was recently passed in Texas allowing people to purchase Narcan without a prescription at Walgreens for only $45 (avg. cost). This means that I currently have a lot of Narcan to give away, and wanted to reach out to this community to see if anyone is in need. Mods can definitely vouch. 
This is funded entirely by out-of-pocket expenses by me and some donations (but mainly out of pocket, so donations are urged as funds are very low and shipping is less than ten dollars...a cost most people can afford to give). I also have a wealth of harm reduction supplies that I am more than happy to provide as well. 
PM me for further details.

The plan, the excitement of how I'm going to do the deed, picking up, etc. As usual, the internal pain that addicts experience played up high, and I got into some fights with close friends and my girlfriend. I proceeded to enter ""fuck-it mode"", and picked up the dope right after;

I stopped my 12mg of Suboxone maintenance dose which I'd been on since April and bought 2g of BTH yesterday from an old buddy of mine with whom I used to use. I smoked a bit of tar but realized I needed about 24 more hours to get the buprenorphine out of my system to achieve a full-on nod.

I smoked some more of the tar this morning; my long lost love and I were reunited (wow, that's weird af...).

I'm going to enjoy the next couple days of using, then go back on the Suboxone.

My addict fantasy begins with getting a room at some cheap motel in the West Coat's best city ($65 a night). Loaded up with 2g of black tar heroin, 2g of cocaine hydrochloride, thirty 1mg Xanax pills (alprazolam), perhaps a gram of crack cocaine if I have enough cash, and maybe some Adderall (I'm prescribed it) to wake up for the next day. Oh yeah, and as many Roxicodone 30mg blues as I can get my hands on! Of course, we cannot forget my good, old trusty dab rig along with 2g of some top shelf cannabis concentrates.

BTH and I are going to be enjoying each other's company for a couple more days now, even though I kind of wish I was had some access to the bomb ECP over in NY. Oh well, beggars can't be choosers! (Not that I'm a beggar or anything...)

Sometimes I feel like the rest of my life will cycle between of periods of using, and periods of maintenance treatment, and this cycling back and forth. Although who knows? I am considering ibogaine treatment in the not too distant future, or perhaps methadone since buprenorphine's partial agonist properties just sometimes don't do it for me.

TL;DR Relapsed on black tar heroin after being on suboxone, and I'm planning on having an awesome polydrug-fueled binge soon like I used to do before before I calmed down. Afterwards I plan to return to the Suboxone, but I will talk to him about the possibility of methadone since I feel the Suboxone isn't as effective for cravings for me.",1472522417.0

I dislocated my shoulder this weekend and they loaded me up on a low dose fent, 4 mg morphine as often as I needed, low dose Valium and the drug Michael Jackson used to sleep. Propanol or something. Then I took 3 oxys later. The other day I snorted 25 mg of opana throughout the day and I can take up to 100 mg Vicodin if I need to. Again this is mostly for shoulder pain as I suffer on both arms and am in intense pain now since this is the 5th time dislocating my right one and I had surgery on my left. Do you guys think I will be okay if I snort 2.5 or 5 mg opana a little bit later? Maybe even up to 10? I feel like I have a low tolerance compared to you guys but decent for the average person. I guess my main question is, first should I combine opana at all and if I do what should be the max dosage snorted. Thanks guys, some of you I trust more than a doc. Personally I can prolly handle 2.5 to 5mg and maybe 7.5-10 at the max. But I like to hear some ""professional"" opinions. ",1472508942.0

I got off the oxy. Went from about 90-120 mg to nothing using mostly loperamide and my girlfriend's encouragement. Shit sucked pretty bad but the worst of it seems to be over. This paws though is terrible.. I have no energy or motivation at all, I break down crying for no reason at random times during the day, and I average maybe 3 hours of sleep a night cause of this damn rls.

Any idea how long this will go on for? I quit cold turkey and then about 4-5 days later I used a bit just to get some sleep. It was a bad idea though cause I got some of the acute wd symptoms back the next day.. since then I haven't used in about a week. I just want to feel normal again. I hate how hard it is to do anything or be nice to anyone or not feel like a dirtbag all the time. I was using oxy for about 8 months or so, first few months were like 30mg or less, but the last couple months ramped up to 100mg real quick. Burned through all my extra cash, I'm hugely in debt to a lot of friends, I needed to put a stop to it. But I'll never be able to pay them back or put things right if things continue on like this. Can someone give me ideas how to deal with this? And how long to expect it to go on before things start returning to normal? I know this probably isn't a good idea, but if I used maybe once a week just to get some stuff done and get some sleep would that do more harm than good? Im guessing I should at least wait till the rls goes away, I can't stand the thought of dragging that out any longer. It's weird, it doesn't bother me so much in the day anymore, but at night it always makes its come back. Then after a night of taking hot shower after hot shower, getting maybe 20-30 minutes of light rest in between, it finally goes away around 7:30-8:00 every day and I can sleep for a few hours. Any idea why it goes away at the same time and always hits me the worst at night? Maybe if I could solve that problem and get some actual sleep id start feeling better. Xanax and muscle relaxers don't do anything but make me super tired while I stay up all night. How do I get through this? Will it ever end?

Thanks for any help you can give me, I'm starting to feel pretty discouraged.

For about 5 months, a very disturbing obsession has gradually grown over me, to the point where I think about it every day.
It'll creep up on me, regardless of what I'm doing.

That obsession, is with the big H.

A few days after watching a Vice documentary (of all things), I became obsessed with said substance.

It hit a turning point when I dreamt about it, dreamt about sniffing it. At the exact moment I thought it was kicking in, I woke up.
This was very cruel, as all it did was increase my interest as to how it feels.

The reason I'm disturbed by all this however, is the fact that I've read practically every horror story about it, every shit post filled to the brim with regret, yet the stubborn spirit of curiosity lives on inside me.

Tried just about every class of drugs out there. After surgery I had a few extra Percocets. When I took just 1/2-1 pill (lower than the anesthetic dose) I had a VERY clear mind and energy -- I got stuff done and was able to work/study normally for the first time in years. I've never felt so NORMAL in the 20 years I've had depression. Not high at all. I only had 3 extra pills so I just did it a few times (each time I got about 4 hours of feeling normal on about 5mg percs, I think -- a really low dose. Much higher and I feel groggy). An understanding doc prescribed tramadol and the bupe patch to see if those would have the same effect. The patch didn't help, but tramadol does have antidepressant properties. It lifted my mood but didn't provide the energy and motivation I had with percs. Are trying percs worth it? I'm so scared about addiction ... but even I had something that made me moderately productive just 1-2 days a week the rest would be SO MUCH easier to get through, 10 hours a week of clarity would go a long way in helping me keep my life together and getting me out of disability. Anyone used opiates to get over depression? I know it's extreme -- like using gastric bybass or a stim for weight loss, but I also know it's used in some desperate cases. 

[Edit #1: I'm looking for people who have experience using opiates under a doctor's supervision for psych reasons. I'm trying to learn what different protocols various medical professionals are using.

Edit #2: I really do appreciate people sharing their opinion. The overwhelming consensus is not to try opiates. I obviously have no intention of getting myself into a WORSE situation so I'm taking all those warnings seriously.

Technically I guess I'm already on opiate or opiate-like treatment. I spent a month on Bupe and have been on Tramadol for a month. The Bupe patch did nothing for my depression (though sublingual bupe has worked well in studies), and the Tramadol has lifted my mood a little bit for the past month, which has been pretty helpful in helping me get basic things done (like shower) and interact with my niece and nephew. My doc prescribes these meds. Anything harder is something we are avoiding for now. 

I will update you all in a few months as my doc and I continue to tweak my meds. Thanks for all the input.

I've always been stuck in my own head, and had a habit of thinking worst case scenario for everything. 

I have never struggled with addiction..until I started snorting h. I went on snorting h for 6 months. Then quit (June 10th), with the help of a rapid sub detox. After almost 30 days clean, I began to chip. The rest is a blurr. I feel like I've been sick for 2 months. Unless I'm being a dumbass and using. After quitting, I made sure that on the days I used it would only be one line per day..but when you do that for 5-7 days it's gonna catch up with you. Id stop for 3-5 days, then back on. I dont think I ever let my body heal. I got ahold of a large amount of subs thankfully. The first time I quit I never used even 1mg at a time. I started at .25 for a few days, then .025 for a few then jumped off. The last time I used h was saturday, 2 small lines, one in the am, one in the afternoon. Today I took 1mg sub and I'm ready to stop this damn rollercoaster. I'm done with either feeling like shit, with no energy at all, or being able to stay up late and do everything (only because of h). Plus, someone close to me is also using subs to quit, so there won't be temptation anymore. There won't be h right around me that I can easily go break off a line and no one will know. 

I'm rambling, I know. Sorry. Now back to my main question. Before h, I functioned normally. I have suffered from depression and add (I am prescribed addy), but I managed. Now I look back and wonder how the fuck I did. I used to work, carry on normal day to day things without needing a drug. Or even thinking hey taking this would make your day great! I dabbled with opiates, if someone offered me something id take it. Then it wouldn't even cross my mind again. I wouldn't go searching for it..then heroin. Fuck you heroin. I am now a stay at home mom, since kicking I can't count how many times we have literally not left the house. I find myself googling and researching everything. Reading every single damn post on here just to occupy myself. I tell myself when I'm kicking ""be sure to take the little one for a walk daily, shower in the morning and get it over with before you talk yourself out of it because you don't even have the energy to wash your hair""..then kicking time comes and I do nothing. I isolate. I don't leave the house, I hardly talk to anyone. I just read and read about addictions and withdrawaling and so on..

So, in conclusion, how do you guys occupy your time? How do you pull yourself out of the rut of not wanting to do anything at all? I feel like I did this to myself. I never struggled before, and I got myself addicted. I am responsible for all of this..what a fuckin dumbass I am. Anyway, I'm kickin, trying to make myself shower now. I want to hear from you guys. Any advice, tips, experience welcome. If you're kickin right now too, let's hate life together!",1472486436.0

         So got a half eighth dropped off this morning 1.8 grams for £50 .Plus him dropping it off saved me £4 on bus fare .I saw him yesterday when I was walking my dogs as he was delivering to someone up the street and asked him what time would be best to phone him in the morning . He said 10am would be fine so come this morning I get up about 8:30am have a coffee and walk up to the shops .Check my account at the ATM then use the Post Office in the shop because the machine charges £1:75 to withdraw YOUR OWN MONEY . Which is strange because I'm sure it's illegal to do that in the UK now and I've no idea why anyone would use it as the post office section is open as long as the shop is open . So lift some money and buy some rolling tobacco the cheapest as I'll get some duty free stuff from the van tonight that's £10 compared to the £20+ for a 50 gram pouch . So I get down the road and by this time it's about 10 am and give him a call .His GF answers and I tell her who it is and what I'm looking for . and she conveys this to him and I can hear him in the background saying thats no problem and he'll be at mine in five or ten minutes :) He lives about 2 or 3 miles away from me in a little village . So I get my stuff ready and sure enough, he's here in 15 minutes . Beeps the horn and I nip out with his cash and gives me the dope through the window . Thank him and head back inside . Put ity on my scales and it reads 1.9g, lovely jubbly : ) Cook up a hit of about 0.3g and get a nice rush from it and a nice warm feeling all over . I'd give the dope a 8 out of 10 . I got really good dope yesterday that I was tempted to go into town for today but he only does tenner bags(0.2/0.3 grams for £10) and won't do weights :( . So he was my back up if my other guy fell through .

   Hopefully, this dope will last me until at least Friday afternoon O.o lol but the way I'm hammering it just now .I don't think it will ,it'll probably last me until tomorrow night if I go slow and is why I've put a bit on the foil so I can have a few lines through out the day and don't keep cooking up hit after hit .

  So hows everyone else doing ? Has your day gone as smooth as mine ? Hope no one is WDing through lack of funds which always sucks !! Hopefully, you can come across an easy and legal way of raising some funds or maybe a friend can give you some dope to help you out . I hate seeing friends rattle and I'll aways share a few units to get them on their feet so they can go out and make some money . 

Any interesting stories about how you or a friend has made money to get some dope ? Anyway best wishes from Scotland ! Have a good one lads & lassies !",1472658616.0

>Focal membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis with IgM and complement deposition was found in seven of eight heroin addicts with the nephrotic syndrome (108). Four men and two women, aged 23 to 40 yr, presented with a chief complaint of edema. Patients had azotemia, nephrotic-range proteinuria, and hematuria. Four patients had hypocomplementemia, and four had polyclonal gammopathy.

This is still valid, but since ya'll are probably more informed about this stuff than I am, if I'm missing something or misstating something, please let me know. Also, PLEASE HELP OUT!

The DEA has determined Kratom to be an ""imminent hazard to the public safety"", and is banning it as of Sept 30. Kratom has been a HUGE benefit to those suffering from opiate addiction, and it's danger profile is much more lenient than the vast majority of opioids on the market. Without Kratom to fall back on, many believe drug users will turn to/stay on harder drugs, eg Heroin, which is both dangerous on it's own, and can be laced with car/fentanyl, which is already an ENORMOUS issue in the USA today, causing untold overdoses and burdening medical facilities throughout the country who have to deal with victims of this epidemic. In 2014 Ohio alone suffered [514 fatal overdoses](http://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/data/fentanyl.html) due only to fentanyl. In the same year, over 10,000 people died from Heroin overdose, and more from other opioids. In contrast, fatal overdose from pure Kratom are completely unheard of, and are debated to exist at all.

Kratom is very difficult to overdose on, is extremely non-toxic, and provides withdrawal relief to countless opioid users. Rather than outlawing Kratom, the DEA should be focusing it's efforts on the real enemies in the 'War On Drugs' such as fentanyl, but due to bureaucratic decisions and general ignorance, they've decided to ban what is in the minds of many, the wrong substance. 

[Here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2016-20803.pdf) is the official DEA document outlining the ban on Kratom. The [SSDP](http://ssdp.org) (Students for Sensible Drug Policy) is a good resource if you're interested in helping keep this plant legal! It's hard to justify taking time to protest these sorts of things, and it seems like you don't matter. Yet if we all step in and show that we care about this plant, we can make a difference, both for casual users and desperate addicts. PLEASE do something about this. Contact your senators (phone call, not email!), contact the DEA, contact SSDP, do ANYTHING YOU CAN to help convince the government that they're making the wrong choice.

And if you think of another way to make a difference, say it here! We would all appreciate it.

So today I got my hands on a 12mcg/hr transdermal patch (not a gel patch) with a total of 1.28mg of fentanyl total in the patch. I'm not opiate naive and have done fentanyl in the past including actylfentanyl in a nasal spray. I'm aware of the dangers of this drug and its potency and that's why I'm here! I have a few questions. 

So I've drawn a grid on the patch measuring it with a ruler dividing it into 8 equal pieces each being 160ug. In the past I was chewing on 500-700ug but had an oxycodone tolerance but gave up the oxy awhile back because I like to use in moderation and my supply for oxy was too easy to get and could have led me down a dangerous road. However I enjoyed my fent highs back then and am wondering if now with no opiate tolerence would 160ug get me high or should I take 2/8th of the strip at first dosing at 320ug. I like to start low and add more generally but fentanyl has such a short high I'm not sure if I could succeed in waiting to see what level I'm at and add more without it just wearing off. 

Now second question I'm currently on 3.5mg of Xanax, 20mg Baclofen (a GABA-B agonist muscle relaxant for those of you unaware of what this is), 10mg methylphenidate, and 8 grams of Kratom. It's my once a month drug weekend and I like to go all out. Tonight my girlfriend and I are planning an adderall night and staying up until sun up, having sex and talking about life and all that fun stuff. So I would also like to know if fentanyl would be a good drug for the crash or if I should skip it altogether and just pop a 5-325 hydrocodone and 1mg Xanax. 

To clear things up I do not plan on mixing fentanyl with any other substance just want to use it for the comedown of addy/Ritalin tomorrow morning or for its own high tomorrow night. 

Which leads me to the final question will it be safe to dose fentanyl tomorrow evening since I've taken Xanax tonight, I know I won't be feeing the Xanax tomorrow but I'm not sure if it still being in my system will increase chances of respiratory depression to a dangerous level even though it'll have been 24 hours. 

Thanks I would like your thoughts on this I'm just trying to be safe with this all and you guys are the best for harm reduction. Sorry if my post is a little scrambled up I think I did alright on wording my questions clearly but I'm really really high at the moment.",1472603650.0

There was also a group offering Narcan training and giving away free samples.

The DEA announced earlier today its intent to place kratom as a schedule 1 substance. All of you know how fucking unbelievably absurd that is. Unfortunately, there's nothing anyone can do to stop it.

So, I need help here. I take 300mg of tramadol daily for fibromyalgia pain and fatigue. I legitimately need the meds, however, I admittedly am only prescribed 200mg a day and do the typical scrambling dance-y thing while waiting for refills. Sometimes, I do better (when my mental health is good), sometimes, not so much. I use kratom to help me in these instances, and I also take it daily to augment the tramadol. Tramadol in the beginning of the day, kratom at at the end.

So my typical day will be 300 mg tram spread out throughout the first few hours of the day, then dose kratom about 8 hours after my first tram dose, and then another kratom dose a few hours later before bed. I am afraid this has increased my opioid dependency and truthfully it may be better for me to be off it anyway. It's a hassle to choke down powder every day. 

I'll be able to stock up on kratom, but how would y'all suggest I taper off and just stick to my tram dose? I am at the point where I'm starting to understand that if I'm gonna keep taking tram long-term, I will have to not look at it as a temporary reprieve from my mental pain and just use as prescribed. But I'm afraid that if I don't plan this right, the pain will be way worsened once the tram wears off, and I'll get more depressed than I am.

What do I do? Lope? Tianeptine? Some RC? Tl;dr: how do I go from taking tramadol in the AM, kratom in the PM to just tramadol without having issues of withdrawal or worsened pain? Thank you all so much. I know this probably sounds laughable to anyone using dope or oxy but too many people I know have played that game and I want to be able to take care of my pain without going down any bad roads.",1472575970.0
