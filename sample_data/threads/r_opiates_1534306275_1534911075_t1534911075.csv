Let me tell you why you may never be able to stop unless I tell u why,"If you had an amazing life let's say when you were clean for all your life and then you took opiates the first time let's say you took some percs or hydrocodone because I doubt a lot of people here went direct to Injecting, smoking, or  snorting..

First of all. When your an opiate virgin you will feel a come up taking it  orally but that feeling to you will feel like a rush. You will feel amazing but because your an opiate virgin, and you have amazing  friends, a place you love to live, a car you love, And a job.... The hydrocodone really is providing 10-20% of the high and the rest is your own brain being grateful about your own happiness in life and seeing and realizing very strongly how amazing your life is. Some people are like this others don't actually have the skills to understand why the drug is making them feel so good so they assume it's because it's just the drug itself providing 100% of the effects your feeling. 

But I promise you.... It's really just because it attaches to your opiate receptors and this activation makes you feel very good about the life you already have. If it's a good and happy and positive life, the high will be very strong.

But when you keep doing it let's say daily, first, tolerance goes up because 10mg now is no longer going to provide you the same effects first because the receptors it attached to broke off (not all but receptors lessen in the brain and become less sensitive), another reason is if you still take it to get that feeling you felt the first time, it's never going to happen, because you cannot just appreciate and be grateful for same things everyday. You think you can just stop living life and think you can take opiate daily and appreciate and love life based on what you have and felt a month ago the first time and since then you haven't even thought of doing or changing or improving ans bettering your life in anyway because you can do opiates and feel good....

No it don't work like that. Same thing with eating the most delicious food you've ever ate the  first time or listening to your most amazing song you ever heard first Time and then thinking  you can just eat th same food and listen to the same song every day because it felt so good when you first heard it so who needs something new... And the brain is very good at tricking you into believing that if this is the  best food you've ate in your life and let's say your 23 years old and this song out of tens of thousands of song you heard is the  best one, what are the chances you'll ever eat or listen to any better? So let m just eat and listen to the same thing and hope that this time if I eat a lot more or listen to the song in repeat and try real hard to feel and remember what I felt doing these activities the first time I tried it last month then for sure I can feel the same good feels again from the first time..


But our brains cannot enjoy th same things over and over... Because the receptors in our brain the felt those feelings already broke off and the new receptors arent the same and furthermore they're already coded not to be sensitive to th same exact feeling because if they did alwwys feels the same thing over and over humanity would literally die off. No one would want to do shit because they feel th same amazing high every day.

The  whole point and reason people keep doing it is to feel that same high they felt the first tim  whereas now they only feel a rush and feel good doing it because they know they will avoid the sickness and the body and brain having withdrawals like crazy mostly because its trying to adjust back into reality and the longer you've been addicted the harder th transition will be  because a 10 year heroin addict has essentially been inactive in life for 10 years. And the longer you go the more likely you will never feel the same high again. And opiates by their own don't really feel that good when you feel the physical aspect of it once you've done it so long that when you do even th fatest shot you only feel a physicql rush but have no actual joy in terms of thinkinf life is so good because you've done nothing at all for years have had no new experiences other than probably losing everything you had desperately trying to score another hit. You're life is no longer planning and living your life for a better goal or dream but just thinking day to day only...wake up, get more drugs, so long as I did that and maybe spent an hour two scoring then coming home and shooting I accomplished something today and I'm good and don't have to worry or think about anything because no addict can think about future goals or dreqms because as soon as they do not they realize there's no place fo any drug addiction in life when you Tryibg to become something unless they're thinking about becoming a dealer who uses his stash too.

And of course I'm sure the addicts including myself although I've stopped for a whlle do the drug and hope subconsciously since they forgot long ago why they kept wanting to get more in the first place (to feel the same magical high) and can't stop it because they always think today if I do it I may feel that high and when they don't plus they get sick when they don't do it they can't stop the cycle and really the only effect that is close to what they felt way back when they first try it is just feeling content you have the drug and did it and have it in your system so everything must be good. That's the onky aspect however abstract it is that remains even in a 10 year heroin Injectjng addict to the very first time they did an opiate. Why the drug felt so good th first time that part is gone and forgotten buried in the subconscious and only the abstract emotion of the contentment it brought is weakly there when a 10 year heroin addict shoots up in the morning or day or night ",1534899702.0

Chapter 3
Taste Profile

During my time working on the original OxyContin project, one of my most brilliant contributions was truly a sublime stroke of absolute genius. 

‚Äã‚ÄãI was, that is to say, we all were completely aware that the market would eventually discover that defeating the time release coating, crushing the contents, and insufflating (sniffing in laymen‚Äôs terms) would produce a high unlike anything the world had ever seen. Even the most hardcore heroin addict would be in awe of OxyContin‚Äôs euphoric flood and endless ‚Äúlegs‚Äù. Opiate naive individuals and opiate-tolerant addicts alike would bow to the clean, long lasting, serotonin tsunami that OxyContin would produce. With this foreknowledge, it occurred to me as I was letting an ibuprofen tablet dissolve under my tongue one evening in the lab when I sensed a vicious headache threatening to disrupt my work, that ibuprofen was sweet. The manufacturer had added a sweetener to the formulation. Not because sucrose would aid the action of the ibuprofen. No, they made the tablet taste sweet because they knew people like me would dissolve the medication under their tongue and find the taste pleasant. These chemicals do not taste pleasant on their own. In fact, they mostly taste so bad that we would do anything to avoid tasting them completely, if we had to do so. Anytime a pharmaceutical compound has a taste, especially one that is pleasing to the palette, it is by design. 

‚Äã‚ÄãWith that, I designed what eventually became OxyContin‚Äôs ‚Äútaste profile‚Äù. Ask anyone who ever chewed an OxyContin pill, or crushed and insufflated one, and they will all tell you the same thing: it had a unique and pleasurable flavor, even when dripping down the back of ones throat from the sinus cavities it had been forcefully inhaled into. 

‚Äã‚Äã
‚Äã‚ÄãThat was me.
‚Äã‚Äã

‚Äã‚ÄãOne may wonder: ‚ÄúWhy would a time released medication, a tablet designed not to have a taste at all, need a taste profile?‚Äù This is a fair question. The time release coating had no flavor profile, it was by design taste-negative. Only after defeating the time release coating and either chewing or insufflating the the powder inside the tablet, would one know the sweet nondescript flavor that is OxyContin. 
‚Äã‚ÄãOne may further wonder ‚ÄúWhy would the drug manufacturer put any thought into the taste of the compound when the only way to experience said taste was by defeating the time-release coating, an act the manufacturer would never condone, an act the manufacturer indeed would warn against performing?‚Äù
‚Äã‚Äã

‚Äã‚ÄãLet the record show this much: we always knew what people would eventually discover about our product; the ways it could be used and the ways it would be used. We considered all possibilities, we always do. We leave no possibility unaddressed, no stone unturned. This is our art and our craft; we are the gods of the world Huxley imagined: better living through chemistry.

‚Äã‚Äã
‚Äã‚ÄãMaybe, if I‚Äôm feeling generous before I reach the end of this dispatch, I‚Äôll share the ‚Äúrecipe‚Äù for the OxyContin flavor profile and those of you with a desire to do so can ‚Äútaste‚Äù the flavor of a lost generation. We will see how charitable I am feeling when I reach the end.",1534876854.0

She mentioned maybe taking those four days and getting a motel or long stay, and and staying there while she deals with the withdrawal effects of cutting kratom and kpins out.

(Snowball) Have you ever...?,"Hi guys, so this just happened: I, being fairly new to them, had just done one almighty knee-trembler of a snowball for myself (do you call them snowballs or speedballs in America?) and a friend who has been a user for nearly 20 years with nary a vein remaining on her body was trying to bang her own.¬†
  
I saw her struggling and knew it must be congealed now so even if she got a vein, the elixir wouldn't pass through the eye of the needle. Crack tends to resolidify after standing around for a while, and actually I had no idea about that until a few nights ago.¬†Which is kind of strange since on one particular day preceding that night, I fixed up four separate rig-fulls of delicious, frightening snowball and had no issues with them getting hard while they waited to be picked next to enter my circulatory system. *(What's up with that?!)* 

  
So, back to the present day: I tried various methods of heating the liquid up to simply just get it out of the pin, but to no avail, so with a heavy heart, we threw it in the bin. She's not dependant luckily as she's on subs, otherwise¬†we'd still be fighting to make it IV-ready probably.¬†It was the last of our gear though so party's over for the night! ¬†
  
I did a few Google searches on the subject, finding only 2 relevant questions asked on Quora where the OP was questioning the safety and feasibility of banging a 2-week old coagulated shot of meth!  
One person, amongst his likely meth-fuelled words, came teasingly close to answering what I want to know: he said if you don't know how to get that thickened blood out of a syringe, you should reconsider your ability to IV and stick to other ROA's.¬†
  
So yeah, how the heck could I have gotten that shit out of there? My plan was then to heat it until it thinned enough to draw back up to have another attempt. ¬†
  
I wanna hear the stories you guys have regarding times your shots thickened until you couldn't use 'em, and what you've done or seen others do to salvage that precious medicine. ¬†
  
Thanks guys. ¬†

If you look in the post history of this account you'll see a detailed post about what's been happening in my family lately, but this post is about something different. My dad has had a bad back, been in severe pain, and been taking (a lot of) pain medication for about 7 years. He always hated the way opiates make him feel, so he usually takes less than he's prescribed, meaning he has extra. About 8 months he started having the issue of being low in his meds, sometimes even out, at the end of some months. Occasionally he would give someone in the family one for various things, but it was never anywhere near enough for him to have this problem. 

Me, being the 21 year old kid the finger was always pointed directly at me. He's occasionally given me his medication for a condition I have, but the second he started having these problems I stopped accepting them from him. My brother has been given them on occasion and complained about the way they make him feel. My mom asks my dad for them pretty frequently, for headaches, when she's sore, when she falls down (which happens pretty frequently), basically she's been asking my dad for his pills at least once a week for a few years now. 

Eventually I moved out (fairly recently), but still visited my parents pretty often, and because the pills still went missing, that finger was still pointed at me. I use some recreational drugs, occasionally even opiates, but my dad has been my best friend my whole life, I can't even bring myself to accept his meds when they're offered to me for my pain because I know it'll throw off his entire life by one dose, let alone steal them and force him to be in incredible pain. Yet, my dad still slightly suspected me, and my mom was sure she knew it was me. Arguments would ensue and she would yell at me, accusing of taking them. 

Fast forward to about a month ago. I'm not gonna go into too much detail as this is a very sensitive topic and I made a post in /r/dysfunctionalfamilies that goes into great detail about these events. My father tried to commit suicide. The only reason he didn't succeed is because my mom called my fiance and I to check on him, we managed to make it there in time to stop him from taking any more pills and call 911. Before the police/EMTs arrived he kept talking about my mom cheating on him. We thought it was just due to the large amount of meds he had just took, but we later discovered he was right. 

She had been cheating for awhile. Last night my dad texted me to tell me my mother told him that she wished he had succeeded and was dead so she could claim his life insurance policy. Immediately my fiance and I grabbed everything we'd need for a potential overnight stay (medications, phone charger, clothes, etc) hurried down there, a drive that usually takes 30 minutes took me more like 13. After a long talk with both parents (not important to this story, again details in other post) we decided to just try to sit with my dad and help him relax (mom had to sleep for worktn the next day). At one point I took one of my medications out of my bag to take it but I dropped it. I was sitting where my mom always sits and the bottle landed in her purse. I reached to grab it but I grabbed the wrong bottle. I realized this bottle had my dad's name on it. 

It was dated 4/2018, and it was MS Contin. Still giving her the benefit of the doubt I opened it up and looked at the pills inside, they were indeed the same 30mg morphine my dad takes....24 of them. Now I know she didn't take these all at once, this is just her stash, but that means my mom had been taking these pills from my dad since April. My fiance saw me with a pill bottle in my hand, assuming it was mine or hers, and put it in her purse. I don't really have much of a question here. I know I'm going to tell my dad, I know I'm going to confront my mom, I'm just pissed. 

I know opiates can make decent people do crazy things, but this is beyond crazy. My own mother was stealing pain meds from my dad, presumably to get high (she has previously and still does have an alcohol problem) and was constantly blaming me and screaming at me over it. I'm just having a lot of trouble handling everything. Sorry I guess this post doesn't really have a purpose.",1534863116.0

We chased the tourists away with our body odor and grease caked pores, blowing hits of weed at their kids. We badmouthed the owners for selling out and never bought more than a cup of black coffee with refills.

So, Travis came to find me, except he wasn‚Äôt really looking for me. He needed a ride for his uncle, but we both knew he didn‚Äôt have an uncle.

‚ÄúSure, I have to be back to work at Ogelvies for four.‚Äù

‚ÄúCool. He‚Äôs back at Geoff‚Äôs. We have to get something out of his car.‚Äù

Minutes later my blue S 10 idled in the shade of Geoff‚Äôs gravel driveway. It was my beautiful blue truck until I forgot to put antifreeze in the radiator, then it was an immovable eyesore that the grass grew around in the front yard of Cheo‚Äôs house on Montoya. The death of that truck marked the death of my 8-month stint of sobriety. Well 8 months is what I told my parents and Cheo. It was more like 4 months, and I was smoking meth the whole time.

‚ÄúBob‚Äôs 73 years old and from Woodstock. He showed up earlier this week and flipped his car down a ravine 2 nights ago. The highway patrol said he flipped it at least six times and walked back up himself. A real miracle. He had to throw his stash and scale before he could walk back up.‚Äù I pretended not to notice that Bob was not his uncle at 73 years old. ‚ÄúWe just have to help him get something out of his car, in Questa.‚Äù

Before my hand came off the horn, an old man busted through the screen door with a bob and swing in his walk. He had an exaggerated limp. The racket of the door, swinging and creaking open and clacking shut mixed into his belligerent squawking. There was no one except us, but he made accusations. He muttered curse words under his breath like he was spitting in disgust and climbed into the passenger seat. Travis squeezed between us.

‚ÄúF***ing imbeciles! I‚Äôve never seen anything like it in my life. Just a pile of horse s***!‚Äù Over time, I would learn that this was his default. Ninety-five percent of the time, he was this way, unless you had some coke or heroin.

‚ÄúI know. I know. I talked to Geoff about it. He said he didn‚Äôt know anything about it and blamed it on Christine. I don‚Äôt believe it, though.‚Äù

Some drama I wasn‚Äôt privy to, but I found out later that his dog was missing. It was one of two times that Geoff and Christine had stolen and traded the old man‚Äôs pure bread Pekinese to Edward for coke, a diabetic drug dealer in a dirty double wide on the south side of town. He was unusually sweaty. His face looked like he was sucking a lemon, and the only hair he had was a werewolf patch on his right shoulder. Deep-pitted boils of brown covered his skin from his baldhead to the stained waistband of his shorts, and he sweat. His shirt was always off, and his health was always terrible, and he was always sweating.

Once after Eddie moved to the north side of town, I saw him getting wheeled into the emergency room. I spent a lot of time at the hospital back then, and since I knew he was going to be checked in for a while, my friend and I burglarized his house. It was blatant and my S10 ran out of gas a quarter mile down the highway. Besides the safe, with some silver dollars and a couple ounces of high-grade weed in it, the only thing I got was rinses out of his dirty heroin cookers. That was the main reason I broke in. We walked up to the Conoco and put gas into a milk jug with the silver dollars. His neighbors saw us do it, but Taos is a land of outlaws, and cops are rarely called.

Eventually the old man‚Äôs dog got eaten by coyotes, in the sage brush behind my house after he moved in with me. The old man had bad luck.

‚ÄúBob, this is Riley. Riley, this is Bob.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Indomitable Buffalo, they can‚Äôt keep me down! Buffalo Bob Cass! Pleased to meet you!‚Äù His tone and attitude completely changed. It was a show he put on; after all he was an entertainer in Woodstock where he lived before and used to do drugs with the bass player of The Band, Rick Danko. He even stood in for Levon Helm when he was sick, because they were both singers/drummers. Levon couldn‚Äôt stand Buffalo though. He thought he was a piece of garbage.

We passed a pipe full of green hash and coughed, crammed in the tiny cab. Bob coughed hardest. He was 73 after all, but when he coughed a weird sound came out of his chest, like a marble rattling in can of soup, probably from the wreck. Travis looked at me horrified. Bob acted like he didn‚Äôt hear it and took every hit he could. On his move to Taos, he stayed in a hotel in Iowa where the toilet broke in half while he sat on it. The water damage was so severe that they wanted him to go to jail. Somehow he lost his U haul trailer with everything he owned because of it.

As we finally got out of town, whatever heroin Travis and Bob did before they found me mixed with the hash to soften the lines in their faces. Their mouths hung open and their chins were on their chests. The silence of sublime sleep filled the cab, but for the hum of 5th gear. To the left a vast expanse of desert territory opened up and summoned my imagination. They said Taos was still the wild, wild west, so I listened for the busting caps of antique six shooters and the thud of arrows through the necks of cowboys, shot from the bare backs of painted horses. Somewhere in the distant dust was the war cry of dark men with long hair and a caravan of covered wagons burning. It was faint, but I could hear it before the road dropped into Hondo and back up towards Colorado.

Funny how people are when they ask you for something, especially junkies. Bob wasn‚Äôt Travis‚Äô uncle. He made it sound like his car was down the street or in Ranchos worst-case scenario but not 20 miles away in a different town. There was almost no way I‚Äôd be back by four. Travis nor Bob had any clue where his car was, not a number to call, not the name of a junkyard, nothing. It may not have even been in Questa, and I bet anything that whatever they wanted out of the car wasn‚Äôt in it anyway. But that‚Äôs how it goes for a junkie in Taos.

At a gas station we pondered what to do. Bob didn‚Äôt have any ideas. Travis was busy smoking heroin in the bathroom, and there are untold junkyards in Questa. Bob and I sat in the truck and smoked cigarettes waiting for Travis.

‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you go in and see what‚Äôs taking him?‚Äù It had been over 20 minutes, and when I walked into the gas station Travis was on an office chair behind the counter. His face was green and body doubled over. He held his gut with his hands.

Before I got back out the door an ambulance pulled up. They loaded him onto the gurney and into the back. It was a bad case of gas as far as I could tell from his diet of pure sugar and the irregular bowel movements of an opiate addict. A gloved hand grabbed a tube of lubricant and a rubber tube in the window, before they pulled away. I shook my head and walked back to the S10.

‚ÄúWell? What the hell is taking so long?‚Äù

‚ÄúAmbulance came and took him. He looked like his gut was in a knot.‚Äù

‚ÄúAmbulance? Really?‚Äù The truck was 15 feet away while they loaded Travis into the back, but somehow Bob had missed it. ‚ÄúAre you sure? I guess he won‚Äôt be coming back with us then.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. No, he won‚Äôt. Probably what he ate gave him a stomach ache.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat did he have?‚Äù

‚ÄúA giant moon pie and a bunch of orange soda.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, no s\*\*\*! What did he think was going to happen? Eating like that! F\*\*\*ing imbecile!‚Äù

Bob got silent and turned away as if he forgot what he said. He looked out of the passenger window, pensive and still, pondering some deep truth about life. Dark clouds gathered over the horizon, and the aura of heroin and his tiny pupils were peaceful, quiet for a moment. His long grey hair barely touched the collar of his leather coat. It was proof of the wisdom only 73 years of life can give.

The crinkle of cellophane broke the silence in the truck. He pushed it back before his dentures ripped a chunk of moon pie into his mouth. The gold handle of his cane rested on a 64-ounce fountain drink between his legs.

‚ÄúF\*\*\*ing imbeciles, I tell ya! I‚Äôve never seen anything like it in all my life. Well, let‚Äôs get going.‚Äù

I started writing about Bob as soon as he moved in. My plans were for a book. The first line went,

‚ÄúThe heartache. The headache. The stink of watery, green feces sprayed on the walls and puddled on my landlord‚Äôs carpet.‚Äù The carpet was new when I moved in. Brand new, and Bob ruined it. On top of my plans for a book about Bob, I had dreams of being a poet at that time of my life. It took me years to realize that I hated poetry.

He began to detox in a bad way, the beginning of a dramatic and obscenity-laden affair of about two months. He kept a welcome mat on the floor next to his bed, and I picked it up out of curiosity one day. Underneath were at least nine cigarette burns where the cigarettes had burned from end to end on the carpet, but the mat was also completely caked with green poop. Between the toilet and his bed, the green trail proved he was not well. There was at least one spray of lime green on the wall by the door.

Bob was a self-proclaimed junkie through and through. He knew it. He told so many stories of all the dope he had done and where he did it and how good it was and who he did it with. Those days were gone though, and 73 is not so kind to a junkie.

We were all dying like him. It was only more obvious that he was on his way out. Dead men and dead women walking, we looked for life in death, because staring death in the face was the only time we felt alive. Everywhere we went, our environments changed to match the death inside of us, but we lied about it to ourselves and to everyone else. None of us believed it, but we lied about that too and pretended that this was what we wanted.

We did meth and heroin and smoked cigarettes in his room, dubbed the shooting gallery. Bob needed a medical detox, but he had a habit of saying he was going in and not doing it. I dropped him off before a six-hour shift at Ogelvie‚Äôs one morning. When I came back to the house, I went into his room to find information on how to visit. But, he sat in his bed smoking a cigarette.

‚ÄúHow‚Äôd you get out of detox? Or did you ever go?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey kicked me out.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey kicked you out? Why?‚Äù

‚ÄúToo much trouble. They said they weren‚Äôt prepared for me. Too much s***ing. Too much runny nose. Said they didn‚Äôt expect me to be s***ing all over the place like that.‚Äù

On another morning I opened my eyes to see him sliding his thermal underwear over his foot. It was the first thing I saw, and the fabric got caught on his big toe nail.

‚ÄúCome on, you f***ing b***!‚Äù He screamed at his underwear and pulled harder. He ripped the big toe nail out of his foot.

I slept with a few different girls while I lived at that place, one named Luanne. Some people tell you they are bipolar, and others you find vacuuming your living room at 4 a.m., dancing to dubstep and smoking a bowl of weed but you know that they don‚Äôt do meth. Luanne was that kind of bipolar, and she spent the night with me sometimes. We were good friends.

I saw another girl who panhandled change in the parking lots during the days and had my mother‚Äôs name. She was beautiful in a weathered kind of way like some old momma you find at the pound, worn and scarred by the world but beautiful because of it. Bob called all my women by the same name: that f\*\*\*ing whore.

Anytime we went somewhere he would tell strangers of the abuse he suffered at my house. It was humiliating and largely untrue, but one hipster kid bought Bob‚Äôs line and sneered at me for my inhumanity. He would take Bob to his house in Tres Piedras and care for the old man as any decent human would. The guy made a big show of how altruistic (one of Bob‚Äôs favorite words) he was and what a disgrace I was. Travis and I laughed so hard that we had to put our hands on our knees to keep from falling on our faces.  
The next morning, I found them in the hipster‚Äôs Nissan in the parking lot behind Tazza. Bob sat in the passenger seat with an unlit Native 100 between his lips and acted excited to see me, too excited, like he needed something, like things weren‚Äôt working out with the hipster. ‚ÄúHey, Riley! I‚Äôm so happy to see you!‚Äù ‚ÄúHmm‚Ä¶. Are you now, Bob?‚Äù ‚ÄúOh yeah! Extremely.‚Äù He turned to the hipster in the driver‚Äôs seat. ‚ÄúHey, you, where in the f\*\*\* is my phone?‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know where in the f\*\*\* your phone is! It‚Äôs your phone! Why don‚Äôt you keep track of it?‚Äù I agreed with the kid. It wasn‚Äôt his responsibility, and they yelled some more before the old man came back to my place.

Bob got healthier while he lived with me, and my heroin habit grew. He put on weight and got his bodily functions under control for the most part. After two months it was time for him to leave, and he had a place rented in El Prado. I packed his stuff into the back of my truck, and for some reason he called me a, ‚ÄúF***ing piece of s***! You know that? A real piece of s\*\*\*!‚Äù

After all I did for him I had it. I had only ever touched him with care and concern. All the times he went to the hospital, I visited him. When he came back from a CT scan, I patted his head and held his hand. At night before he slept, I washed and rubbed those two petrified pieces of mahogany he called feet and lathered them with tiger balm, but now I had him by the collar and my fist cocked back behind my head and bit my lip. ‚ÄúOh what? You‚Äôre gonna hit a sick old man are you? Bet you feel real tough! Don‚Äôt you boy? You‚Äôre real tough now!‚Äù I threw his boots into the back of my truck and took him to his new place. My back tires sprayed him with muddy snow and gravel when I tore out of his driveway.

After he moved out, my manager at Ogelvie‚Äôs, Tiffany asked me about him.

‚ÄúHe said, he thought he was bothering you a little bit or something.‚Äù

‚ÄúA little bit?‚Äù We both laughed.

He had been in on a Saturday afternoon to watch his Iowa football team play Ohio. Tiffany said he kept walking around the place ‚Äúgrabbing himself.‚Äù She called me to come watch him, and in case things got crazy I could take him away.

Ogelvie‚Äôs fired me for acting goofy when I came out of the bathroom and wearing sunglasses to wash dishes and the weird film that collected in the corners of my mouth and for obnoxiously ranting at customers. A week after that I defaulted on the rent at my place. When my landlord came to see me, we talked for 30 minutes in the cold next to the shattered front window while addicts lurked around inside. He was nice about telling me I had to go, but when he left I found a loaded syringe behind my ear. The weather had already cracked the engine block in my S10.

Before I moved out Bob called me to tell me he broke his hip and that he was staying in the old folks‚Äô home by the hospital. We hadn‚Äôt talked since the day I almost punched him, so I went to visit him.

‚ÄúYah! Fell on the ice on the road up to my house coming back from the movie store.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat did you rent?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know! Some s\*\*\* flick about a hit man. Whatever it was, it wasn‚Äôt worth shattering my hip. That was it, though, when I fell. I couldn‚Äôt do anything, and it was getting dark. The neighbors drove around me and up to the house to watch the news! Can you believe that s\*\*\*? Drove right around me lying on the ground! I could have died!‚Äù

I smiled. It seemed hard to believe, but unbelievably bad things always happened to him. Now he graced the nursing staff of the geriatric ward with his red faced, foul mouthed, screaming accusations. More than once, they caught him rolling around in his wheel chair smoking weed in the hallways, while he pretended that the pictures on the wall were fine art. When he didn‚Äôt get what he wanted from the staff, he messed himself and rolled up to the nurse‚Äôs station and demanded that they take care of it.

‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre not dead, Bob. I missed you.‚Äù

‚ÄúMissed you, too, Riley. Missed you too. How‚Äôs that piece of s\*\*\*? What‚Äôs his name? Timmy? Can‚Äôt stand that mother f\*\*\*er. When is he going to get where he can take care of himself? I mean. He‚Äôs only 38.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù He was referring to my buddy who had been living at my house since before Bob came around. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know where he‚Äôs going to go. I don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôll go for that matter.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean? Are you getting thrown out?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. I decided to buy some coke last month while the rent money was in my pocket. You know how it goes.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. Yeah, I do. Haha. F\*\*\*ed yourself didn‚Äôt you?‚Äù He showed his dentures with a smile.

‚ÄúYup.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I won‚Äôt be home for a while. At least another month. You can stay there and help me out when I get back home.‚Äù

‚ÄúAwesome! Thank you!‚Äù

‚ÄúJust one thing, Riley.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah? What‚Äôs that?‚Äù

‚ÄúLeave Tim wherever the f\*\*\* you found him in the first place. The last thing I need or want is his sorry a\*\* at my place. Lousy piece of s\*\*\*.‚Äù

I moved into his house a few days after Thad stabbed me in the face with an umbrella over a handful of Xanax that I stole from my friend‚Äôs leukemic landlord. Despite all that I had going against me in terms of reputation and appearance in town, the black scabs on my face embarrassed me, because they made me look less than sophisticated. Looking sophisticated was the least of my worries, and while Bob was in the hospital, my new friend Johnny and I tied my mattress to the hood of his car to move me and Tim and Tim‚Äôs dog into Bob‚Äôs new place.

Johnny and I used to tear through Taos in his white Lincoln Town Car with two other kids while I projectile vomited out of the passenger window. Both of those kids are dead now. One jumped from a cliff escaping imaginary and malevolent figures. The other overdosed and got left in his car at the ER one night. They found him dead in the morning.

Other times Johnny and I hung out with an older nurse who hated me until we shot cocaine together. Then she stripped down and danced and sang for me while Johnny and I laughed at her. She never noticed that I wasn‚Äôt into it, but that didn‚Äôt matter. She was into herself.

It was common to watch her mix way too much cocaine with way too much heroine in the same shot, and ten minutes later she bragged about how she only ate granola because Fruity Pebbles were so unhealthy. She told us about a house she had in Ranchos that was haunted with a patch of red paint that bled through multiple new coats over several years. Eventually she had a dream in which all the details were disclosed about a 19th century abortion involving a teenage girl and a priest in that bedroom. I tried to contact her about the story, but she‚Äôs dead too.

Bob ran Tim and his dog off as soon as he got home from the hospital and fell in a pile of his own feces soon after that. He had gotten mad at me about not giving some syringes to Johnny in an episode of dementia and yelled for help all night long after he fell. I let him sit in it until the morning, even though I couldn‚Äôt sleep for his yelling. It was how heinous I had become. He struggled to breathe for several days before we took him to the hospital, and it turned out that one of four broken ribs had punctured his lung. He snuck his IV out of the hospital when they released him, but when he pulled it out at the house his blood was black saw dust.

Sometimes I had fits of furious passion in my bedroom and banged out reams of nonsense on my electric typewriter like a maniac firing a machine gun. Sometimes I decided that the world was ending and that I would die soon. Then there was no point in writing. Sometimes I wouldn‚Äôt even get out of bed and chose instead to watch the squares of white sunlight slide slowly across the floor and up the wall until I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore and had to get up to figure something out. Sometimes I yelled at my dog from all the stress Bob caused me.

I forgot that I even had a dog, until now, but I probably wouldn‚Äôt have told you about him anyway. My career as a dog owner was a disgrace, and I thought if you hated me any more than you already do, you might stop reading. Not that my neglect of the old man two paragraphs before this one shouldn‚Äôt make you hate me enough to stop reading, but these days people seem to value animal life more than human. Let me tell you about my dog. He was a good dog.

It was Thad who brought him to my place after finding him in the KTAO parking lot some months earlier, and he was mostly heeler, what we called a Taos Cattle Dog. We named him Serio, in part because he seemed serious and in part because Sirius is the dog star. It fit well, and he understood me perfectly. He would leave at eight in the morning and return at night. He could sit, stay, lay down, get on the bed, get off the bed and anything else I asked him to do. He never went to the bathroom in the house, except this time I screamed at him in my bedroom, and he pooped on my bed. It was clearly intentional and made me laugh because I deserved it.

When I moved from my old place to Bob‚Äôs, I overdosed on anxiety meds and left him outside of Smith‚Äôs grocery store. It took me several days to realize that he was missing, and when I did, an empty leash tied to the railing at Smith‚Äôs was the only thing I found. Serio showed up at Bob‚Äôs the next morning, even though he had never been there. It was an amazing feat and endeared me to him more than ever.

Now, I can‚Äôt remember if these last few paragraphs are about my dog or the electric typewriter my dad gave me. Either way, they were both destined for doom like everything else I cared about. My typewriter slid slowly off my bed even though I could have stopped it, but I was too depressed to move. The impact shifted the keys, and it never worked again. Serio was taken from me by another local drug addict, who was better than I was. He accused me of neglecting the dog but shot him for killing one of his chickens a week later. Such was my life and everything that I touched.

‚ÄúEverything the warning labels on prescriptions say not to do, is everything you want to do!‚Äù He laughed with his dentures out like he was channeling my old friend Bobo. With tears in his eyes, he told me of entertaining back when he was Buffalo Bob Cass and made crowds swoon. Every time he died and went to heaven some ‚ÄúAbe Lincoln looking m\*\*\*\*\* f\*\*\*er‚Äù sent him back saying he had to come in the front. That he couldn‚Äôt come in the back door.

Once, he woke up in a refrigerated room under a sheet of plastic. His clothes sat in a bag on his feet and he had a toe tag. He got dressed and found dope hidden in his waistband. The whole hospital was frantically searching for his missing body, while he snorted drugs in a bathroom stall. His friends already had all his stuff and were squatting in his apartment when he walked up. A soothsayer in Woodstock told him this was his last incarnation and that he was paying the price for the evil of his past lives. These were the stories that he told.

One day he watched Yolanda, Garth the dope whisperer‚Äôs girlfriend, open his window and hang her belly over the sill before she slid onto the floor. The lights were off and she supposed that he was gone, but he watched the whole thing from his bed a few feet away. She came for the flat screen. Bob slapped her in the head with his cane and used his walker to escort her to the front door. That was Taos when I knew it. Your friends robbed you and talked bad about you when it didn‚Äôt work out for them. He sent me to the bank to pull 40 bucks out of the ATM and get some cocaine one night, but I took 300 dollars out of his account and never came back. The year‚Äôs last snow had still not melted.

When I was homeless the next summer I would end up at that desert oasis in Ranchos called Taco Bell. Inside I would stare at the walls painted purple and red to make it look less cheap and listen to the soft jazz. The dropouts working the counter understood the plight of life in Taos and let me drink the cold Baja Blast with a water cup. I pondered life and what could have been and what was not. Tourists stopped in to eat as they passed through town. Their kids complained that their sister did this or that and wanted to know the next time they would swim in the over chlorinated pool at the hotel. I would close my eyes and imagine that I was one of them on a road trip with my family in late August. Back to school commercials offered deals on binders and loose-leaf and pencils on the hotel TVs. Anxiety put knots in my stomach when they played, and I could feel it all, like I was there, like I was 11 years old again waiting to start the 6th grade. Then, I would push the door open and walk the highway miles back to the Albertson‚Äôs parking lot looking for a fix.

The last time Bob and I spent time together was right when he got out of the hospital again, a year later. We had not talked for a long time, but I knew where he lived, and I knew he was in the hospital, so I moved in. I was renting the front room out to Johnny and his junkie girlfriend who drooled on herself and always had 4 or 5 spoons on the kitchen counter with streaks of soot and the scattered pink crumbs of pills she called fast 5s. One of her eyelids always stuck halfway shut, and she paused several seconds between every word. They didn‚Äôt look very fast, but who was I to judge.

Bob was happy to see me anyway. That was the life of a junkie, even at 75. You go to the hospital. You get out. Junkies are living in your house, and the party goes on. My girlfriend, Danielle, put the light bill in her name, because Bob owed money to the company, and he asked us to. But when he made us mad one day I threw a big box TV at his feet and busted the white powder all over his floor. Danielle and I went and turned the power off on the old man in the middle of winter to collect the deposit. It was the last time that I ever saw him, but not the last I heard.

A year later, he called me from Miami where I suppose he died. Years later in the foyer of a church, a woman asked me if I had a grandfather who passed.

‚ÄúHe wants to tell you hello.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou mean you talk to dead people?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy friends are passed over.‚Äù She said, as if calling them dead was politically incorrect.

‚ÄúOh, well, I didn‚Äôt know my grandfather. I don‚Äôt know who it could be.‚Äù

She struggled to get the deceased‚Äôs name, but could not come up with it.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll let you know if he tells me his name. He says he loves you. He says you went through a lot together, and that you were in a bad way. He said he is proud of you, for doing so well. Very proud.‚Äù

She walked back over to her table, and I forgot about her. My girlfriend and I talked at our table. She said she thought contact with the dead was evil. I had my own opinions of how that worked and explained. The lady stood up suddenly and screamed,

‚ÄúBOB!!!!! He says his name is Bob!!!!!! He loves you and, he is so, so proud of you!‚Äù",1534821638.0

It was just hydrocodone. I was a kid. A stupid fucking kid. It's no excuse. But where in D.A.R.E. did they teach us to worry about the pills the doctor gives you?

She asked for my help and thought I was fuckin' with her and didn't feel like helping... ""Little ungrateful bitch"", I hear as I climbed the steps because my stomach hurt so bad. Not my stomach, lower, my ovaries actually, but I didn't know that yet. I crawled down the stairs in tears an hour later, my mom apologizing and rushing me to the hospital. 

  
The doctors ran their tests, promising me pain relief ""just after one more test"". This was after 3 or 4 but whatever, they're the doctors, not me. Finally an internal ultrasound, which was basically a dildo with a camera on it, poking the SHIT out of my ovaries. I cried and cried but at least they found what they were looking for. Finally, because they found the source of the pain, a cluster of ovarian cysts, two of them being baseball sized and already rupturing cysts, I could get some relief.   


Now this is where the funniest and also worst joke of my life comes into play. My mom tells the nurse who is hooking up the morphine to my IV. ""She was supposed to celebrate her 21st tonight with friends"" she tells the nurse. The nurse looks over at me, still doing her job, ""Happy Birthday, hun"". My mom continues ""We had to call off everything, but I guess now instead of saying she had her first legal drink on her 21st, she had her first shot of morphine.""  I didn't laugh. The nurse didn't laugh. My dad chuckled a bit. I probably would have if I could have, but the pain was too much. I would have laughed too, fuck it. They monitored me overnight, when the pain stopped, they sent me home with a few scripts. ""You still have two golf ball sized cysts there... speak with your family physician, they'll get you on hormones to get to those other cysts before they rupture, but come back in a month so we can be sure they've negated in size rather than the latter.""   


My dad said he watched the whole time. My dad is inherently good. Wonderful. He had ""The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly"" on my shit hospital TV, he said he hurt, watching me literally writhe in pain, he'd never seen that before in all his years, he was 55 or so at the time. But he said he watched, he watched the morphine drip in with the water... he watched the TV but paid more attention to my movements... he watched them slow and slow as the morphine dripped in. ""How are you feeling?"" he asks halfway through the movie. ""Like shit"" I reply, ""But better, at least maybe I can sleep."" ""Try"" he said, ""try to sleep."" I drifted off and he said he watched my body lie still, finally at peace in his mind at least, and just as one of our favorite movies was about to end, in comes the nurse ""We need to send her home, and we need this room."" she tells him. ""But.... The Good the Bad and the Ugly is just about to end, can't I wait with her and finish, then we'll go?"" What a fucking guy. My dad is amazing, that is a thought I will never let go. He didn't get to finish the movie. He grabbed all my belongings and put it all in a bag, I left in hospital socks and two hospital gowns so I was covered. They wheeled me to the exit and a nurse stood with me while my dad pulled up the car. My mom had left hours prior. ""The pharmacy on x block will be open 24 hours and fill this for her"" the nurse said to my dad as he lifted me into the car.   


We get to the pharmacy, it's not my usual as my usual isn't open at 4 in the morning. My dad is inside waiting for my prescription, but I don't feel right, I open my door and lean out the car. I throw up for a few minutes, mostly dry heaves, and stay there, slumped over, head in my hands, hospital socks somehow still clean. ""Did you throw up?"" It still makes me laugh that he asked. ""No dad, it was the coyote"". He looks at me confused, because the joke doesn't make fuckin' sense... ""yeah Dad, I just threw up but I'm okay"". He closes my door gently and get's in the driver's side. He puts the script in my bag of clothes, rubs my back while encouraging I put on my seat belt again, I do so, and we get home safely.   


My mom is awake and comes to hug me, I hug her back and tell her ""I need to go lie down"" so they help me into my room comfortably and set all my stuff in the corner. I tell them I'm just going to sleep, that the pain is gone, and I just want rest.   


The pain is gone. It's GONE the next morning. I feel great. Like it didn't happen. I go to clean my things stacked into the corner of my room. I put everything away but one thing.... a script to a bunch of hydrocodone, I guess in case those other golf ball sized cysts rupture before I get on hormones or in my case, birth control. I toss them into the drawer with so many other pills, all the same. Maybe different colors and different letters, but they were all the same. I start to wonder about them. As time grows, my curiosity does too.

  
One night I had a headache, a migraine, the kind that pounds until you can't keep your eyes open but still can't sleep. I say fuck it, I try the pain medications I was so carelessly given so many times before. I'm not sure at that moment that I THOUGHT, I kind of think I just DID. I grabbed two like they were motrin and that was the beginning of the end. I caught a nod my second time taking a pill and I discovered the Wonderful World of Painkillers. But I thought it was just that.... I thought it was just a painkiller... I wasn't really sure on what they could DO or BE.  

The only thing I want now is to get off heroin. I want to get off heroin and I want to be that person that gets to tell others the DANGER of taking a pill prescribed by a doctor. DO YOUR RESEARCH I want to scream to the world. I grew up in a home without drugs. My parents didn't even know. When they finally found out I was using... they were SO confused. They were so ANGRY, and all I thought was, how can you be SO angry when you handed them to me? I'm glad opiates are a more well known term now and that more and more people know what that shit can lead to. But I wish my family and I had been that educated years ago...  


Now I move carefully each day as to not get into trouble. ""Don't get caught"" I tell myself every day. Just last week I thought I was going to jail. I had an unpaid ticket because I was in an accident, the cop said I'd get my ticket in the mail because his printer wasn't working? Whatever. I didn't seek that out. I was late for work the other day so I pushed it a bit too much and got pulled over. My fucking dumb fucking ass. Man I saw those lights behind me and as I shoved my heroin literally up my vagina, I plead with myself in my head, don't have a warrant don't have a warrant don't have a FUCKING WARRANT.   


The officer is at my window. H secured in my vagina purse, and both hand on top of the wheel. ""Stop your car and give me the keys"". I do as asked. ""Where are you going?"" I mutter ""work"", ""And from?"" ""my home on x block, officer"". ""Why were you speeding?"" I reply ""I work in 3 minutes"". He tells me ""Well, I guess you're not getting there on time today, huh?"" I can barely breathe. He says he'll be right back. I know my fate. A jail cell where the HOPEFULLY don't strip search me. And if they do? Jail eventually, most likely. Not a holding cell, JAIL. I wait forever it seems. I see the officer coming back, a ticket in his hand. I assume it means there's no warrant, and I almost cry. He steps up to my window, ""No more speeding okay? We don't want someone to get hurt.... you are shaking a bit though, sure you're alright darlin'?"" I admit it, ""no officer, I'm okay, just spooked by police in general you know?"" I force a giggle, trying to seem normal. He laughs too, and says ""Yeah, that happens, I understand. Don't take off now until you're okay."" I don't think I've ever met such a nice officer before, but then again I am a young, white female with sad eyes so I am almost guaranteed an easy ride in this world.   


This world is so fucked. I got lucky last week. I've been lucky my whole life, actually. The reality is.... I'm the luckiest of the unlucky. That's what I tell myself. I am A Functioning Addict. I am Invincible. But the truth is? Anyone can fuck with me and win. I sometimes just.... get lucky. ",1534796482.0

Anyway, I had a friend who got into heroin years ago and she'd occasionally crash on my couch. Before I knew she was using I noticed a distinct change in her body odor. It's hard to describe. Almost metallic but mixed with a very light sweet combined with musky. That still doesn't do it justice really. It's just a very heavy odor that you can almost taste. It's not BO. Not garlic or vinegary. And it wasn't for lack of showering as she'd take two a day at least when she was at my place.

I didn't think much of it until I ran into a guy yesterday who said he was an active user. And there that smell was again. Slight metal mixed with a hint of sweet and musky. EXACTLY the same as her.

 "" I totally agree, you're correct and might I add, you are so cool I had no choice but complimenting you OP!""

OR

Ancient alien hypothesis believers? 

( notice I used hypothesis, theories already have established evidence supporting the idea, allowing it to be considered a theory.)


These are some angry subcultures. I wonder how angry a dual subscriber would be.


If you can provide me any evidence to back up that hypothesis show me! I'd love to actually find some evidence.

Now, for general opi rage. I'm a happy drunk and happy stoner. I understand those occasional angry drunks who misunderstood a situation getting angry when there isn't a justification...
I Don't understand opi rage at all tho. 

WD rage makes sense, but who the hell is actually angry? I only ever find sad/irritated/tired addicts. Nobody's out there being an asshole in WD When you'd think detox would effect their mood the most....


So Why do you think opi rage is so prevalent? I mean shit, they have what they needed now. If I spend a day in WD miserable, why would I get high just to spend it angry? 


I know I wouldn't get addicted to a drug that makes me uncontrollably irritated when hi. I actively avoid addicts with opi rage. 

Most explanations seem to say people prevent and/or  annoy/interrupt the opi  rager from enjoying their "" zone"".  

A.k.a where they want their high to be basically.

I find that's a bullshit excuse and the rager is usually being an overreacting drama whiner. I think they're simply self involved.  Being selfish snobs who somehow believe they don't annoy anyone themselves...I'll never understand them tbh. Especially since they just get angry and ruin getting hi sessions over pointless shit. ( opi rage couples are the worst to third wheel around)

Does anyone remember reading any papers studying any involuntary anger response by a brain reaction to opiates? 

I don't feel like diving in deep without referred sources tbh. So lmk if you've seen any academic discussions on this.



I'm bored obviously so lastly,

 what are things people commonly say to them that irritate or make you shake your head?...


 My personal example: 

""hey, pat said you're a history buff! Omg me too.! Can you believe puma punku is 12k old! Or how do you think they could build the pyramids? After all, it's a mystery! Levitation?! ""

RAGE. Thankfully mine dissipates quickly.

I was hiking and I fell 70 feet off the top of a mountain. Since then i have been in increasing pain. I started experimenting wit opiates before i broke my back but got more into them afterwards to help with the pain. I did heroin a few times while still in high school, i used to order it off the darknet. 

Last year i moved to a big city for college from the suburbs and have been in even more pain since moving to the city. I dont have a car and have to walk and take public transit which is very painful. Standing for over 15 minutes begins to hurt and i need to sit down, after an hour it feels like i am going to collapse. In the last year ive been using opiates more heavily lately just heroin but only a few days a week max because it is too expensive. I really like using it and getting high but im honestly over it, i hate waking up the morning after, my girlfriend who lives with me hates it, and obviously i dont want to be a heroin addict

I started seeing an orthopedic doctor this summer for the pain and he referred me to a physical therapist.  I have been going for a month and it has helped a little bit but i am still in so much pain. I feel like my doctor is reluctant to give me a prescription because of my age but the pain is unbearable. Should i schedule another appointment with my orthopedic doctor? How can i convince him to give me a prescription? He has all my records and we did xrays and MRIs and there are physical issues with my back like how my spine is shaped. 

Ive also been wondering if i could get on subs because i dont want to do heroin but i crave it so much especially when im in a lot of pain, and subs supposedly treat pain and cravings. ",1534733880.0

Let me say that I am not even gonna do it because I understand its wasteful, and ive been trying to limit/eliminate my consumption anyways, but I was very curious about it to to a lack of info. 

Anyways, what is the high like? I know the bioavailability is poopy smoking it, but I know when you smoke or snort something you are changing the high drastically by going around your first pass metabolism, usually making it stronger.

I've rationalized a 1000 reasons why I shouldn't go, or I should put it off a week or two, but I'm putting the blinders on and going.

I've been doing a rapid Suboxone Taper this week - coming off a massive 8 month Opana binge. I think I took 8mg 8mg 4mg and 2mg this morning. The Inpatient Rehab I'm going to will continue to give me subs and possibly ?benzos? Idk - I'm doing this totally voluntarily, but I agreed to 30 days. Anyway, I know all about detoxing, but honestly how much detox meds is this Rehab going to give me? How would you compare vs kicking at home?

I can't remember the last time I took a Xanax, but I've been contemplating getting one today just so it'll show up in my piss tomorrow so I can claim that I have a ""big"" benzo habit in order to hopefully get more Xanax to get me thru this god damn impending opiate detox.

So, what can I expect for the next 30 days? Any advice?

In some nations ""heroin"" might be bupe, in others some kind of synthetic even decades ago. It seems weird to wonder but will actual heroin essentially become a DNM curio or something, for youngsters that want something exotic or old heads wanting the real deal? Will addicts actually get a taste and tolerance for fent analogs to where they will not be interested in actual acetylated morphine?

I ended up having necrotic pancreatitis, and a spleenic vein thrombosis. Needless to say its VERY painful, and opiates are the only option. So it started with 1ml subcu 6 times a day. I was sent home and given 1mg tabs. They kind of worked at first, but was still pretty uncomfortable. So they upped it to 1mg, and 2mg when needed for pain (usually at night or in the mornings, when im not moving around, im on diuretics as well so bladder fills up and pushes on the other fucked up organs. Needless to say even now I generally wake up every 2-3 in pain. So I kind of have a few questions:

How can I make it stretch? Basically my doctor is only open 4 days a week, so I have to think far in advance when I need more. The last two times I renewed a prescription either the doctor or pharmacy messed up and ran out. Think its 5-10 mg day is my acceptable level so I can run out in 6-12 days. So Knowing this id have to cut in half whatever I had just to function (it sucked). I dont really know much about the other delivery methods if I need/had to do that just to get some sleep.

Secondly, I wouldnt even know how to find a dealer, what its worth, etc. If I had to. Obviously this is not my #1 option, but the alternative is debilitating pain, and probably back in ER. 

Thirdly they simply dont seem to be effective anymore. Ive given what I have taken so 1ml subcu for 2 weeks, 5mg/day, for just over a week, and 8-10/day for the last two weeks. Is it possible to have a tolerance at this point? If so, how do I bring that up with my doctor? At current its always needed morning/night, but on a really good day dont need as much during the day (moving around, endorphines im guessing). On a bad day I need alot more.

I've been using a cheap Bic disposable pen that I removed the back cap and ink cartridge from as a tooter ever since I started smoking my opiates. After a while I get some gnarly resin build-up which as we all know, is pretty potent stuff. To clean it, I used to just scrape it with a paper clip to get everything out, put it on some foil, and smoke away. But I've found that putting my finger over one end and putting a few drops of boiling hot water into the other end, covering that end with my finger, and then vigorously shaking it for about 2 minutes, works a lot better to get the resin out. After that, I take a large piece of foil, dump the resin-y water onto it, and evaporate the water to leave behind the resin, which I promptly smoke. I was just wondering if y'all had any different or better methods to getting resin out and using it. Just getting tired of the water method because the whole process takes a while.
NO, I will not use foil as a tooter. Too fragile. Any advice will be greatly appreciated.",1534635925.0

I am new to Spain. I get kidney stones every few years and periods of severe migranes 2x a week that then disappear for months. Can someone familiar with Spanish pharmacies tell me what I should ask a doctor for? I need a an equivalent for Vicodin ES (migranes), and an equivalent for fast release Morphine 30 or 60 mg (kidney stones). Generic is best as trademark items are very expensive here if you have to pay cash. I can get 30mg cody / 500mg paracetamol fizzy tabs for 12cents each over the counter, but they don't do the job anymore and all that paracetamol is better avoided.

I tried asking the doc for something stronger than codiene, he flat out refused to give me opiates and instead gave me Novotil (metamizol), which is a decent painkiller, but I had a reaction which wiped out all my white blood cells and had me in the ICU for a week with huge infections and black rotting toes! This is a documented syndrome effecting persons of western European heritage for some reason, and Spain will probably join the rest of the world in banning Novotil.

Addicts are no more selfish than normal people. In fact, the situation sometimes demands selfishness.

For example, your acquaintance asks to share your dub, which barely has two shots and you need one for your wake up. If you share, you won't be able to get to work in the morning and so miss a day's pay and perhaps get fired.

You see, it's not like sharing half your sandwich at lunch time. In fact, addicts frequently share food, drnks, clothing and blankets even though we will go hungry or cold.

I have fallen out, but never officially ODed somehow (miraculously). Do all ODs happen within minutes of a dose? If you are fine an hour or two later are you clear from the OD zone and is it then safe to let yourself nod hard or go to sleep? This is something I have always wondered about.

Does anyone know/have experience removing sugar from heroin? Even if it is complicated? Or can someone point me in the right direction?

Suboxone does take the edge off but it doesn't cut the pain out completely and this is most likely due to tolerance (due to taking it for OVER 10 YEARS , 8 YEARS STRAIGHT EVERYDAY)


Should i stop taking my Suboxone now, and start again later on? at a dose of 0.5mg ? (i usually take between 0.5 to 2 mg )

Let me preface by saying yes, I am an idiot. I knew subs were for heroin maintenance. I knew it was potent for those with minor opioid tolerances. I knew it was extremely addicting. I didn't care, it cured me, even if temporarily. I'm still not sure I care completely about quitting.

I developed legitimate, minor addiction after 2 weeks straight of use around Oct. Nov. 2017. I had been using sparingly since 2014-2016  obtaining the drug from my fathers medicine stash (although I would also sparingly use opis from other sources such as tram (lots, although no dependence developed), and rarely hydro and oxy). It has been a monkey on my back ever since, I've kept it secret pretty well but I am worried my sparing use will lead to me losing my job, as dealing with the WD on the sales floor of a retailer is hell on earth. 

However my question is, could I get prescribed subs for my... sub addiction? Or am I better off pulling a tall tale and saying I was using oxy/h.

Feedback greatly appreciated.,"So heres a little backstory. About 10 months ago I tried H for the first time and didnt really think about how serious of a decision I made and honestly didnt ever think about a possible addiction in the future but before you know it I was doing the shit everyday, only ever snorted never banged.

Things got out of hand pretty quickly and I realized I had to do something so I tapered my habit down to about half a point of (china white?) a day and then last week I went to a health center around where I live and was put on Clonidine and Gabapentin to help with any withdrawal symptoms I may experience while trying to quit. 

The reason Im confused is that its been 5 days and ive only taken .1mg Clonidine and 300mg Gabapentin once or twice a day and the only physical symptom of withdrawal Ive even noticed has been insomnia. Which I already experienced here and there before ever doing opiates, and it wasnt even that bad. Ive slept atleast 4 hours a night the past 5 days or so. 

Is this normal? Since my habit began Ive had to go without H a few times not by choice and it seemed to be a lot worse. The anxiety and everything, but this time ive had almost next to no anxiety about it and pretty much zero withdrawal symptoms. Is it just the meds doing their job or what? I havent even veen taking the recommended daily dose. 

Any feedback is greatly appreciated. Previous to H I'd only done percs and opanas here and there so Im pretty opiate naive compared to most people with a habit. Thanks in advance!",1534551884.0

The last 8 months of using were speedballs while popping 4mg of xanax, 60mg of Addy everyday.

So back in December a bunch of bad shit started to occur. One morning i'm walking into my job and there are multiple desk so everyone kind of greets you, to my luck a loaded rig fell out of my jacket and bounced on the ground and the room was silent as my boss's eyes started to water...Everyone thought I was clean again and here I was just to hurt everyone again. I left to get high and to kill myself. At this time  I was using multiple times a day and got sepsis from multiple Staph infections and my body started to reject the H. I would register and then up or down the vein it would start to balloon under my skin and I started missing even when hitting the Jugular. I was so depressed and couldn't really get high so I was WD and decided to cut myself thinking I should just die, as I cut I noticed my blood was extremely sticky. Out of all the red flags in my life this was the only thing that got my attention. I went to the doctor and was told if I don't stop ill die.

So fast forward I stop using and it was withdrawals I didn't even know existed. I had a fever for about 80 days, extreme depression with normal WD stuff. I somehow never got out of the acute WD stage. How the fuck is that possible?? So then I go use for about 2 months and quit by using loperamide for 2 weeks then kratom a week after and then the WDs were a joke, I was a little sad for a few days and that was it.

So what I was wondering is if you do a good taper and make WDs less extreme then you won't deal with the acute or PAWS as long??

Ive been clean now over 100 days and at no time have I seriously considered getting high. I don't know how this is possible. Im usually miserable. I'm even training for a half marathon and ran 9 miles the other day. Like who the fuck am I and why do I feel normal again? ",1534536165.0

The question is: can I cut the patches in a way that I can use them to get a lower dose?

I need to stop now or my wife will take my kid away.

These patches are the ones that come with a metal layer to start the release, I was thinking about cutting the whole thing and leave the metal part there until I use it.

Now I know this is highly frowned apon, and highly discouraged in the name of harm reduction.  


I have been IV'ing the pink liquid methadone you get from the clinics. Using a 3cc/3ml, 23g syringe, I am able to shoot half of a dose in one shot using these syringes.   


Here is where things get interesting. You know how orally, it takes methadone 1+ hour(s) to kick in? Well, via IV it kicks in instantly, with a rush and it is far more euphoric and warm than when you take it orally. It is on par, IMO, with H. It is amazing.  


Now, here is where harm reduction comes in. IV'ing anything that isn't made for IV is NOT GOOD. But upon further review, if you are being prescribed VistaPharm methadone, it is 100% safe to inject.   


Other INACTIVE ingredients in the liquid methadone solution:  
 **SORBIC ACID,**  **POTASSIUM SORBATE, POLOXAMER 188,** **GLYCERIN, PROPYLENE GLYCOL,**  **SUCROSE** and **WATER**   


Poloxamer 188 is related to Propylene Glycol. It is used to stabalize the solution. Propylene Glycol is actually used to make IV solutions, as is Poloxamer 188.   


So relatively safe, but as with IV'ing anything, it is not 100% safe, as there are still the risks that are associated with IV drug use. I am not sure what is in the other Methadone Oral solutions made by other companies, but if you are prescribed the VistaPharm brand, it is fairly safe to do.   


It is a lot of liquid to inject, but that rush and euphoria is something that I never expected from Methadone. ",1534520472.0

In my 5 years of heroin addiction I've always smoked it (apart from a select few times when I've pinned it) and I was always led to believe that it's best to smoke it off the dull, non-shiny side however my dealer said its best to smoke it ""sunny side up"" i.e. on the shiny side due to there being less chemicals. He also said that it's best to use the shiny side to smoke from due to the fact that the dull side reflects less heat so you get a better melt on the gear.

Is this true? Granted before I smoke anything off it I make sure to run a flame over both sides to minimise the amount of unwanted chemicals I inhale but which side is better?",1534512750.0

I had a conversation with my friend about withdrawal. When we first started using opiates, at least in my case, I went weeks of using without any bad withdrawal symptoms. Eventually, I did get withdrawal, but it took a while. Take a short break and start using again, and the withdrawal symptoms are back in DAYS. It appears that in the ""honeymoon"" stage, the brain is forming new connections and rewiring certain parts to accommodate the influx of opiates. These don't go away, thats why even after a long, long break, you will be in withdrawal with just a couple of days of using. Interesting thoughts here on exactly why it's SO hard to stop and even then, you still think about 'em. Your brain is still looking for those awesome neurotransmitters that it thought it would be getting constantly.",1534509061.0

Exhaust myself with a little meth.. there‚Äôs method to my madness, I want to use as little of my benzos as possible to get to sleep-, but once I go to sleep on the first day  here‚Äôs the plan....

5-10MG of Lorazapem, + 300-600MG of lyrica, as my primary withdraw agents

Will titrate with Clonindine - which might even help with the leg pain 

Looking @ all interactions they seem to compliment and enhance each other, which is why we will be monitoring blood pressure, to keep it low but not under 70.


Bananas bananas bananas - that will be my food.

I have 10 8MG Ondanzetron for when or if the vomiting starts, plus immodium for the other end

Panadol for pain, & chewable vitamin c to help flush my system of all metabolites.

Water water water -

Hospital is 4 minutes away - should something go wrong.

If I cave, I have 32MG of Bupe tablets, & I will take them 1-2MG  absolutely ONLY if the Ativan & other combos don‚Äôt hold me at bay...& I reach for the oxy. 

I suffer anxiety, shaking, and hot cold sweats - I never get a runny nose, or the runs or anything it‚Äôs fucken weird ..

I don‚Äôt need to hide anything, I don‚Äôt have to worry about being functional ...for a few days

I know it's all good, and my brain is rewiring so the mood swings and the depression and the happiness that turns into panic are normal. Still I'm freaking out inside and I wanted to get it off my chest.

I've been to literal war, I've risked my life countless times over countless things: stupid or otherwise. Yet here is where I always feel so scared. The most scared I ever feel is when I'm right here. SOBER. Dying is easy. I'm scared, and deep inside I'm in full blown terrified meltdown, and this is my 21342412413 try. I'm not hopeless. I've grown a lot.

We all know the drill for the first few days. Then you find yourself in a position when you've been clean for a while now. Not enough to get cocky (another monster to worry about - getting cocky. That's what got me the last time) but enough to be afraid you'll fuck up the few days you did manage to gather. Enough to be so afraid it's easier to just give in. Or is that just another excuse?

Because honestly I've been trying to understand myself and trying to understand my addiction and there are a thousand right answers and seemingly no wrong ones. Same goes for all the fucked up shit that goes in my head: I can't figure out why, ever, because there seem to be no wrong answers. Only right ones that come to me like epiphanies as I wipe my asshole. One day I can suddenly \*\*understand why\*\* for fuck's sake I'm as trusting as a dead cat then three months later suddenly understand \*why\* again - and both answers fit. So which is it? Does it even matter for the healing process? I have no fucking clue.

Guys you're all amazing. I know it's not fair for my friends but sometimes no matter how hard I try I can't shake off the feeling of being judged. And they can't help it because like Eminem said, they don't know what dope is. So thanks? No thanks? For this lovely community where we are blatantly honest and aware of just how badly we fucked up. I won't be around here anymore, because we really do just focus on how badly we fucked up. What about all the hard, exhausting, painful work ahead to fix it?

If I'm going to be called the junkie, I might as well  go back to the junk, right?  Emnrace it, even though I've quit for now.
-------

I've really thought of myself as a junkie, but I'm just coming off an opiate addiction that went from a few pills every day to a lot of mgs of oxy  every day, to snorting a few points of heroin every day.  The whole thing lasted about 2 years this time and led me to try H for the first time in 2016.  

Fast forward to 2018 and I finally follow through on a commitment I made to my husband to get off opiates, but I'm doing it for me.  I even walked away from a decent hydrocodone prescription that got me by about one week a month, even though it was over 100 pills/month.

I quit everything in July with a mild taper and kratom, as well as the usual gaberpentin, weed, benzos.  Withdrawals weren't hell to me, probably from the kratom I'm now wanting to wean off of.  I got 31 days off H and 29 days off All opiates, when last week I was presented with a rare 4 nights alone, so I slipped and had a three day run that no one knows about but me.  After one day off I used again for two days last weekend, after having to put my dog down.

Last Saturday night after my husband and kids went to bed, and just hours after watching my dog die, I must have done a big dose and nodded out all over the house, including falling down in the kitchen and hitting my head on the bathroom mirror, nodding out while brushing my teeth.  Thank God nobody woke up.

Sunday night I did another big dose before bed and projectile vomited in front of my husband.  He couldn't even tell I was high, just thought I was sick.

This Monday morning  I woke up and said that was it.  I was saving over half g for my birthday, which is this weekend.  I ended up dumping all the heroin I had left (not the first time I've done this) and took some kratom instead.  I puked my first spoonful of that, but the rest of the week has gone pretty smooth.  Until tonight when my husband found out I smoked a little pot.  He called me a junkie for smoking pot, even though I've been on H a lot of times around him and he rarely notices.  When he does I just say it's my pain and anxiety pills.  I get no credit for quitting opiates.  He's actually ok with me taking pain pills by doctor prescription.  It's just hard to get a satisfying prescription these days.

He thought I was through with pot, he says tonight, but he sends mixed signals because sometimes he realizes it helps me with anxiety and pain, and minimized my use of harder drugs.

So now I'm the junkie, although I've never tried a needle, have fairly successfully quit opiates (it's a process), and he only knows about the pills anyway.  Maybe I should carry on with my commitment to quit the poppy plant, or maybe I should just become who I really am, be the junkie and go on one more run.  

In Breaking Bad Jessie embraces being a criminal (I'm the bad guy) and in Justified Boyd Crowder embraces, and comes to terms with being the Outlaw.  Perhaps I should heed my hubby's words and just embrace being the junkie.  I do feel I have one more run in me and I might as well do it while I can still stomach the horrible kratom that keeps me going now and will help me quit when it's time.",1534483055.0

I will sometimes, when I buy a good amount of pills 50-100-120, if I know they have been hidden tucked in the sellers underwear or if like today I am told by one of my dealers that he currently just got out of the hospital for a double bad eye infection and he just touched all these pills when he counted them and they were in his possession for a little while which im sure at some point probably he touched his face/eyes and touched the pills without washing his hands.


When I do occasionally end up needing to do this, I will just lightly soak a paper towel in 90% isopropyl Alcohol and one by one lightly rub each pill with the towel then throw them into a container to dry. I get that I may be a bit over reacting and my buddy called my weird earlier but these are things I am going to literally be eating so it gives me a little peace of mind knowing they are clean & disinfected now.


Actually while I was doing this earlier I saw amazon sells a UV light phone cleaner/ disinfector which I thought would be perfect for this application, as I wouldn't have to get the pills slightly wet with alcohol even though it dries almost immediately. Then I realized that might be a bit overkill plus I don't know if it would effect the pills potency in any way.

What do you guys think am I a weirdo for wanting to protect myself from who the fuck knows what after you get some pills that might have been tucked inside a baggie in some d-boys underoos or possibly have some infectious virus on it in my case.. or am I just being a big pussy going overkill with my germaphobia ?

I also bought some Fent Test strips and Mecke Regent test just so I can make sure when I have any doubts that something I might be getting is a little off, some of these fake presses getting made today can really be hard to tell even if you have the real thing right next to it to compare to which I try to keep one of each of the most common 30s around for reference because I do buy in bulk but not reselling them its all just personal use for my monster habit which sucks and I have to get under control by the end of the summer hopefully.",1534481164.0

I know for a fact with me coming, his runs were easier, and more likely to succeed. 

Fast forward to today; I get a call from the dude, he's not home, but he wants to go see the plug. All good, he tells me to pick him up at his friend's house so off I went down to the ghetto of the city we live in. When he walks out he is visibly high on crack; how can I tell it's crack you ask? Since we have little to none of them methamphetamines where I'm from. Well... very little anyway, i've seen pressed ICE pills, they're suspect to say the least, anyway my point is, dude is definitely smoking hard, and he is in full window watching/carpet surfing, paranoid about Alexa listening in on us mode. Shit, dude was sitting down in the car, but hitting up that crackhead shuffle. Dude was also trying to drink water, and if you know crack, you'll know how hard/ awkward it is to try and drink something, even with the thirst of a black dog in the scorching heat, drinking water on crack always goes weirdly.

Anyways, he finally decides it's time to call and get my run on the go, I wanted the one gram of cocaine, and four 4mg dilaudid, that's 150 (gram Tony Montana100, 8mg=$25) and this price is pretty good, standard in my area. So after checking his pockets, I see he's definitely missing something after he asked to use my phone, I realize he's missing his phone. At this point my junkie brain is scheming, I know I can get the number from this guy, I just need him to think he can use my phone, and that his is fine until we get back.  I convinced him, saying I didn't have time or the fuel to be going back since we are going back there after anyways. So after he uses my phone to call the plug, dude is way too high and not tech savvy enough to worry or even think about the plugs number in my shit. GOTTEM.

 So after we make the usual run, which in his state, took 25 minutes of talking (probably about some bs that only he cares about his car, his phone, whatever his crack riddled brain is settlling on!) I bet the plug was ready to kill herself for real. We go back to his place to do a shot. I do up a nice speedball, decided to try 8mg dilaudid + 2 pointsish of blow, by the way the girl is easily 8/10, it completely dissolves without even mixing, tastes like pure diesel and rings your fucking bell like crazy! (As you can likely tell from my post here, but frankly fuck it, you guys understand lol im gonna put a video in the comments of this shit dissolving like sugar) I even hit a vein first poke! Fuck yeah, i'm feeling like Ice Cube, today was a good day. 

Fast forward 2 days later, my main plug just  ran out of 8mg shields (the heart shaped 8mgs) and im getting ready to call my friend and go thru the bs and the extra money (it really sucks to get a good price on 8s for 3/4 of the month, then dude absolutely rapes me every single time we made a run). The run would take 5-10 minutes out of his life since the girl he went to was on disability and always wanted to make money, she only leaves home like 3 times a week for groceries, to play cards on Friday, and her daughters Sunday dinner we never had to wait or fuck around with her, probably the most professional dealer ive ever met (which is going to turn out great at the end of this story for me lol) she always gave him something to drink and tried to get him to eat, she was basically drug dealing grandma, not to mention this lady is always awake early, and will stay up late if you ask her to be ready, she will. She gets a large script for her hips, and this is her money she's hoarding away for her daughter and husband, this lady is a legitimate saint. 

Everytime he would charge me 20 bones, and a point of blow. So 30 bucks every.single.time I went on a run, and basically it was me driving him to the spot, for free and then giving him money and shit cause he knew the right person, which I never objected to, she had amazing blow and always had pills, so it was worth the little bit of extra money, but my ""friend"" never gave me a break, even on days that he got more than I did, on principle he ""had to charge me, his time is valuable""

So im scheming, deciding what im going to do for a plug since my main is out for the remainder of the month, than I remember about the number. I thought hard about it for at least a half hour, I like my friend, hell I even enjoy the drama and excitement that goes along with the run, it's part of the reason I like this drug and the game so much, it's always an adventure. But the money was killing me, I'm working hard, OT every day in the heat, planning  and working toward moving on up to a better apartment and some upgrades to my car and bike. So I decided to send her a text, she knew who I was instantly, my friend clearly calls on my phone, and they must chat about me during the deal. I straight up told her the truth, that I was a good customer, and that I loved the way she did business, but that I couldn't continue with it, purely monetary. She understands and tells me to come thru, I bring the usual 150, fully prepared to pay it but turns out it was only 125, my friend was adding 25 bucks into the coke, AND charging me 20 and a point. So at this point I don't even feel bad, I just love that this worked out. 

Today I get the text ive been waiting for, the dealing grandma, saint of the dope game, had finally informed my friend how she thought I was a lovely guy, and thanked him for the business by giving him a half, and an 8, 75 dollar business getting bonus! But dude is pissed at me, actually he says his ""feelings are hurt and I trusted you"", he says he enjoyed the runs and having me to hang out with, and he would have brought me in with him, so basically he would have got her to lie for him about prices, all while giving me the illusion that he isn't dry fucking my little virgin b-hole, and that it has nothing to do with the money üôÑ. So anyway now im at a crossroads, I don't necessarily want to lose this friend, he's a good guy, but I just couldn't handle the fucking anymore. 

Anyways, what would you guys do? Would you cut him out (wouldn't be the end of the world, but I don't mind the guy, and it's hard to find friends who don't steal or whatever) or would you maybe just keep calling him to do runs? But renegotiate the prices. I'm opting to buy him a full g of blow, and a few pills just to shut him up about it. Help me out here. 

TL;DR- I had a ""friend"" that made runs for me, but charged me out the ass, I picked up said friend while he was high on crack, and basically schemed the plugs number out of him, got gud with the plug and now ""friend"" is upset, says it's about hanging, I know it's about money. ",1534473482.0

I‚Äôm a 28 year old on Suboxone and Klonopin. Please read and relate. I‚Äôd like to hear your story and how you overcame it (or still stuck in it) if you can relate.,"Can anyone relate to this?  I was pretty much a good kid in high school.  I had a great childhood and I never really did anything bad in high school.  Sure I partied but so did everyone else.  Weed and alcohol junior and senior year.  I always fill my mind with the past as to why I‚Äôm like this now.  College came (community then big schools) and that‚Äôs where everything slowly but surely got worse.  My drug habits got more diverse and my alcohol use went up.  It seemed to be the only thing fun about college.  I still graduated but it didn‚Äôt mean shit to me.  Basically my life has been regret since.  Regret about why I studied what I studied.  Why wasn‚Äôt I normal ?  I had a hot girlfriend for almost 3 years, experienced love, experienced basically everything a kid would growing up. 


Fast forward to now and I‚Äôm stuck on these thoughts: was it because I always admired crazy people and the biggest parties because they excited me most?  Was it because I got caught up with the wrong people?  I mean as kid I always wanted to break the rules even if it was breaking them lightly, like going to the neighborhood you weren‚Äôt allowed to go in because it was too far  (I always use the term it‚Äôs all relative).  I would quit a lot of things.  Start them and never finish.  I did break my arm as a sophomore and got prescribed opiates to this day I don‚Äôt remember what they were but I liked the feeling and especially the morphine drip they put me on in the hospital with the button.  I loved that button

My point is does anyone who takes subs think about this as they get older and let it plague them?  Also, if there is anyone similar to me I‚Äôd like to hear your story.  I‚Äôm on subs for 10 months now with 3 or 4 1 week benders in the middle.  Don‚Äôt know why I chose this route because I feel like it‚Äôs just a bandaid not fixing the problem but it‚Äôs the route I chose.  The problem is, in rehab I couldn‚Äôt figure out the problem!  Why I got like this in the first place.  Is it because of the genetic disease like they say in rehab?  I never believed that.  Whether it‚Äôs true or not I feel like I still could have avoided it.  I was one of those people that never took it too far but far enough that it became a major problem and the one that affects me most in my everyday life.  I‚Äôm definitely an addict I know that, but I never did as much in one sitting as the people around me and never shot up, never ODED etc.  Everyone in rehab would say ‚Äúyou will if you keep using‚Äù and that would piss me off so much.  I started to think I was better than them (which I wasn‚Äôt) either way rehab was a fail.  I got 100 or so days of all opiates but the alcohol use slowly affected more and eventually I went back, broke my collarbone a month later, it got worse, I was jobless at the time so after that bender I said fuck it I threw in the towel and went on subs thinking it would be easy like it was in the past on subs.  It‚Äôs not easy !  I moved to Chicago from Jersey for a new job in June, but I‚Äôm not joyful.  I don‚Äôt feel clean either, and I don‚Äôt take my job seriously nor am I motivated.  I also watch and read a time wasting amount of opiate related things (documentaries, movies, YouTube vids, reddit).  I‚Äôm debating starting all over.  Can‚Äôt take a shit to save my life (or a piss for that matter).  I always thought this would be memory by the time I was 28 and we would look back at that time be like ‚Äúdamn we were crazy and stupid‚Äù but LOOK AT ME NOW FOLKS.

Iv tapered from 100-120 mgs per day down to 60 in the last month and just took my last tramadol last night. (25 mgs) 

For comfort meds I have some short acting sleep meds, lots of loperamide (radiation to the gut so Iv needed it daily for weeks), a little lomotil, CBD and marinol. 

To my benefit I think my body weight is way below normal, meaning I have very little body fat (normally 120-130 currently 96 lbs which is why I was given marinol). And I take diuretics twice daily along with magnesium and potassium. I dont know if there is any logic behind it but I suspect the diuretics probably keep chemicals flushed out of my system because when I was taking the norco it really only helped for about 2 hours leaving me with four hours in between where I was pretty damn uncomfortable. Maybe I was just to tolerant but one more reason to get my bodies own natural pain controls kicked back in and stop depending on liver killing pills. 

So my question is, should I ask my oncologist for anything else to help ease me away or should I be fine at this point?

My experience was pleasant and dreamy but nothing orgasmic. After this event I did have a period of around 1 month though, where I'd think about heroin it was kind of weird, I couldn't get it out of my head. After 1 month I completely forgot it. 

Now 6 months later I smoke H for the second time, well I was supposed to do it earlier but it was so low on my mind that I forgot it. It was pleasant like last time but a bit less actually, maybe the setting was not as good or the dope less powerful (I doubt it though since it made me throw up at the end). This time, I completely forgot the drug 2 days later. 

So, is it normal that it's less good as the first time if I wait so long or the dope was maybe less good? Anyway, fun drug I enjoy it but what a waste of time sitting on the couch all day.

I told them about my use of opiates and so I was treated with more pain pills than the usual person obviously. The first 3 days I was on 220mg+. Anyway long story short, they told me they couldn't send me home high and I had to detox in there and then a lady from the drug dependance unit came and seen me and I jumped from 220mg to nothing in 2 days, went into WD's in hospital then got put on subuxone.

Whatever it is, coke, tar (never shot good powder dope), crystal, hell I‚Äôve even shot mdma lol, every shot seems to take about a minute to hit. I do get a rush, I think, but it‚Äôs def different from what a lot of people report. I guess I kinda like having a second to put my stuff away, rinse my rig out, put a hot compress on if needed. 

I just did a half point coke shot and went through that little routine. Then it started to hit me, after about a minute, so I laid down and wrote this. Not the best gear so .05 was a dumb small hit so I‚Äôm already back to baseline. I only have a pathetic .26 bag so I‚Äôm deciding whether to just slam the rest of the .2 (and yak a lot) or do two probably enjoyable .1 pushes. I‚Äôm one of those ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a stimulant guys‚Äù who still does hardcore stim shit all the time but still tries to avoid the real rough edges of that game. I ate a hulk to calm myself down but a .2 shot still might be a little much. 

But so yeah, I‚Äôve had other addicts agree that it‚Äôs not *that* fast but I see threads on here where people talk about feeling it just seconds after pushing down. My average seems to be about a minute before I start to feel it, maybe another 30 seconds to peak. Sometimes I hop around and hyperventilate and swing my arms around but I don‚Äôt think that even does much more than just standing up and taking a few quick steps. I have a super fast metabolism too, what gives? I feel like I‚Äôm missing something.



Also, completely unrelated crack head tangent here, there was a big news story recently, like national news somehow, was posted in here, about that billionaire dude Henry Nicholas. I guess the chick with him is an aspiring Real OC Housewife so I was reading all about their past scandals and scoping her IG and shit. That kind of lifestyle is already so morbidly fascinating but shit really gets crazy when you add a bunch of hard drugs. I don‚Äôt even live far from Newport I gotta get in touch with Henry Nicholas and make him hire me as his personal assistant.

So I wrote down the way I remember it.,"  I regained consciousness with narrowed vision, feeling disoriented and short of breath. 

'Fuuuuuck,' was the first thing I thought to myself looking up at the EMTs, firemen, and policemen who were crowding my body's resting place on the floor between the coffee table and the couch. My second thought was of her, and so my eyes shot around the room wildly, between the bodies of the men and women who just saved my life as they spoke slowly and loudly telling me I'd overdosed, and inquired as to whether I knew on what. Of course I knew, but I lied and said heroin. I made eye contact with her in that moment and my heart simultaneously sank and split in two. She held our cat, bobbing her up and down as you would a newborn to get them to sleep. In this case it was more likely an instinctual reaction to trauma. Like ventilation for excess, since her drenched eyes and cheeks suggested the normal avenues were well beyond capacity. I got up slowly against the resistance of the EMTs gently trying to push me back down into sitting position, telling me I need to take it easy. ""I need to hug her."" It felt stupid that I needed to state something that was so obvious to me. I felt like a fucking caveman using those words. As I got up and walked slowly toward her with someone's hand resting on my shoulder as if to make sure I don't take a spill, and also remind me that this ordeal isn't over, her body shudders and she bursts into tears. I take her in my arms and with my left hand I squeeze her head against my chest and my right around her waist, pulling her into me. 

""I'm sorry, I didn't know what to do. I panicked and I couldn't do the narcan. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry,"" She cries out over and over again between gasps to breathe and helpless piercing cries that by this point made me lose my shit entirely. We both sobbing and apologizing profusely for a minute before I backed up and placed my hands on her cheeks in a futile attempt to wipe her tears away. In that moment I found myself meticulously savoring the shape of her face and the beautiful, glistening brown sorrow in her eyes. A sense of urgency struck me as if I'd never see her again, and a surge of panic cleared my foggy senses. I took this opportunity to calm myself, just long enough to memorize the  devastated expression on the face of the woman I love- the woman I'd just broken and lost forever in a way I didn't yet realize. My heart soaked up the guilt in these precious few seconds, where it hardened and eventually cracked, leaving me scarred and broken right along with her to this day. She finally looked me in the eyes. 

""I'm so sorry. Thank you for saving me. I don't want to die. I don't want to do this anymore. I love you. I love you."" I would have repeated the same few sentences ad nauseam if it weren't for the EMTs telling me it's time to go. I squeezed her one last time and said ""I love you.""

Reddit commentators quickly pointed out the irony that this test would just attract gays on both sides, tested and tester.

Well it strikes me that the more rules and regulations pain management clinics pile on patients, the only ones willing to submit to them or take the time and effort to study them and take it seriously are people who are hopelessly addicted or selling their script so they have a profit motive. Entire conduct guidebooks and rules you must follow, unwritten rules that depend on each location or even individual doctors, random drug tests you must do with an hours notice, pill counts, pill safes , required hours of physical therapy or alternative treatments, psychological counseling and it goes on and on. 

Actual patients in excruciating pain or end of life care or cancer patients ain't got time or brain power for all that, most of these people have trouble getting out of bed even with narcotics, and forget following byzantine rules or you're cut off. I've seen real human beings in stage four cancer on chemo or life ruining pain, these people are lucky to be functional enough to remember to carry their ATM card when they go out for fast food, and thats usually the big accomplishment of the week.

But those were just the bad times.

 I don't think I had any of those thoughts while high. Going to score dope was an amphetamine rush. Making the exchange was like crack. No shits to have while drawing up.  

There's no longing for normalcy when you're nodding so hard that you hit your head on your broken subwoofer and still not have a care in the world.

Whether you're deep in addiction or running the 12 steps, people are rarely happy.  When I'm hooked and feel like shit it seems salvation is in being clean.  When I'm clean and feel like shit it's obviously in being high.

Very lovely morning
Try not to kill yourself today
Think of all that you'd be missing
Prescription made...
Painkillers

Count your blessings early 
Before the lot will hit the gates
Winnings for the lucky living just takes 
Painkillers

Living just comes with a bit of heartache
Heartache comes with a bit of young faith
Faith stays young till your heart get broken
Hope grows up to become someday
I never hurt no one and no one will ever hurt me
I believe I believe I believe I believe
Faith plays dumb till the doubts all leave
I believe I believe I believe I believe
Manna won't fall till the people all speak
I believe I believe I believe I believe
Canaan ain't far for the souls who barter their pain for sweet relief

My queen won't feed on milk and honey
She impartial to the summer sun
She's a lone fire burning in the sand
And a cold, lonely night without one
She cocks her pistols 'fore she pops her collar
Oh she's all but lethal pulling off that laser gun
She's rips the halos off of angels for the fun of it
If all she ever does is smile at you, run
What'd ya need these for?
Round here the cries die young
Fly momma, fly to where you come
Speak momma, round here the quiet die young

Very lovely morning
Don't kill yourself today
Think of all that you'd be missing
And don't you ever pay mind to that line in your way that says you'll ruin it
You'll ruin this for everybody won't you
Very lovely morning
Try not to kill yourself today
Think of all the things you'll be missing

Floating gently, I could die

But my cloud is not what it once was
Spiralling down, just because

Stuck in hell is where I'm found

So I'm never really a user of opiates. My last time was 20mg oxy about four years ago and it made me sick as a dog. I just got a few vicodin 7.5mg for doing a friend a favor and popped one but made sure to eat a meal before to prevent any nausea. It's been two hours and I really don't feel anything at all. Should I redose or wait? Is 7.5mg even a recreational dose even if I have no opiate tolerance? I don't know if you're supposed to take this stuff on a full stomach or what.

If I do redose are there faster ROA's that aren't boofing? Normally I take adderall and benzos sublingually and it works out great but I'm not sure if it applies to hydrocodone.

But i have crippling pain
Im scared shitless that i won't be treated for my pain if my MRI results do not display any new details about my injuries

I am one of those people that are in the predicament of , being trapped in the Suboxone ""Opiate Addict"" cycle

And thats not saying that i am a opiate addict, drug user, etc. i am a user of buprenorphine . it doesnt matter the reason i started using it


On the way out of the doctors office, after the doctor had prescribed me Tramadol,he told me ""i do not want to give opiates to an opiate addict""

Why am i automatically grouped in with addicts because i seek pain relief?

This has happened to me quite a few times.

Some Doctors refer me to pain clinics, some doctors blatantly state they WILL NOT TREAT ME whatsoever . (With Narcotic or Non- Narcotic medicines)

My primary doctor now thinks im a drug addict cause' i take Bupe.

The people at the hospital, when i tell them 1 or 2mg of bupe, twice a day, they think i either take 8mg-2mg twice a day (i.e. 16mg of bupe) they think i am a hardcore drug addict

Suboxone initially probably did save my life but now all it does is get me high lol -_- . 

Suboxone is 25 to 50 times as strong as morphine
Buprenorphine used to be HIGHLY sought after in Europe , in rural areas 1 suboxone tablet selling for up to $120 each and is becoming the choice drug in jail aside from heroin etc. 

you see the people that takes opiates are usually in some sort of pain,
or even recreationally most people do not get addicted ...

How can some countries have opiates OTC, and others not?

The government does what the voters want us to do and because we all ramble on about how bad opioids are, they're getting banned .


When i was younger, i had no trouble getting scripts for low-dose oxy or hydrocodone. Now  i have to suck the doctor, nurse, pharmacist & insurance companies dick  .


When Obamacare came into play the new insurance tried to force suboxone strips on me (utter garbage)

When another new insurance bullshit came around, they tried that again, and then told them if they do not cover my Amneal Buprenorphine Tablet, {they are the closest thing to the original stop - sign orange suboxones} i will no longer use them, did they approve them . 


The pharmacist who has no right to talk to my mother about my medication {i honestly dont mind but jesus christ lol}, is telling her about how Soma will make me ""floaty and high"" (i no longer get my meds there, but i came to pick up my Soma there that one time . ) 
Soma is a joke ,
Flexirl is a joke,
NSAIDs are killing me
The only thing keeping me alive right now is drinking canned pears blended with broccoli through a straw . I can't even eat pussy or suck a dick . I have constant migraines, tension headaches and other migraine, neuralgia pain

Its just become very difficult for me after the Prescription Monitoring Program came into effect

Ive been dehumanized , demoralized, improperly treated, overdosed with various medications passed the daily allotment (i.e. the allotment for a day of Diclofenac is 200mg,,, which they had me on like 800 lol... and they did NOT care that it was burning a hole in my stomach)


Because i have yet to get my MRIs due to pain my Doctor would not write me a script for physical therapy so i could get some temporary pain relief

So now i understand why pain patients turn to heroin

I personally wont be turning to heroin, i have a lot of codeine and dihydrocodeine, but i dont really want to use them . I am trying to do things properly & by the doctor but this is now ongoing 6 years straight of being treated like shit by doctors.

My new primary doctor most likely will prescribe, but what the fuck? Our entire country is just naive . 

By the way - don't believe the overdose statistics on TV. that incorporates numbers of overdose deaths that INCLUDE things like antidepressants. 


i just am fed up . i may begin to use the code/dihydro and see where i get. the codeine i feel will not last long enough. i feel it might work, but not be strong enough.

(and yes, i know all about bupe tolerance, so i would not start a new regime like that without detoxing a little bit . i usually only take 1mg anyways)

Now, when i have pain, or i think about pain, i get overwhelmed with anxiety thinking about it . Its stupid and not fair . 

If the war on drugs was ended Mexico would be more stable because the majority of their income is literally from the sales of drugs to the united states which is why the narcos act as the government . and yea, blablabla",1534389071.0

I knew it was definitely more effective than snorting the ECP I get around here, but still, my butthole has been pristine and unpenetrated for all of the years I have lived on this fine earth. But for some reason today was the perfect storm of cirumstances.

I was driving home from dropping off my girlfriend who lives about a half an hour away from where I stay. I was excited to get home because I had about half of a bundle left over at my house and nothing to do tomorrow morning. But, as a snorter, I was annoyed as my allergies had been acting up and since I can only use one of my nostrils in the first place, it was going to be annoying as fuck to get noddin' away. 

Then a voice, a mere whisper, ran through my mind. Almost like an ethereal, echoing voice of god, or at least god played by Morgan Freeman: *Use the butthole.*

My junkie senses tingled, and I remembered I had a few bucks to spare for the week after a hefty paycheck last week. I drove to my local CVS before I got home. Distracted by the holy voice still recounting the magic that I had learned from this sub could be accessed through... well... my ""holy,"" I got to the checkout counter. A pretty girl around my age asked me what I was doing tonight. Me being an awkward dumbass lost in thought about the sweet glory of pumping hard drugs into my anus like basting a turkey, I just spat out ""its for my dog"" (?), grabbed the change from her hand and left.

A quick google search and I found the guide that I read in that same voice, and fast forward to now: I have finally defiled my precious rectum and am high as FUCK as a reward for my sins.

.....‚Äã‚Äã

Reggie and I met one night in Matts tiny room, through Amy. Reggie was tall and skinny like me, and when I told him I was trying to buy an 8 ball of powder he offered to source it for me. I rode with him and Jimmy, a short portuguese guy with a high pitched voice, to a bar in an old train car a few miles from Matts house. Reggie went in with my cash and came back to the truck with exactly what i asked for. I put the bag on my scale on the floor of the track and weighed it; 3.5 grams. ‚ÄúSee kid? I told you, I dont fuck people. Im good people bro, you‚Äôll see‚Äù Reggie said. ‚ÄúYeah, it weighs, but I wont know what it is until we get back and I drop it in the water. I gotta see how she swims first.‚Äù I countered, and Reggie knew I was right. 
‚Äã‚ÄãWhen we got to Matts, I cooked up a half gram in a spoon, testing the quality, and it was good.
‚Äã‚ÄãI handed Reggie a fat crack rock and said ‚ÄúTell me what you think, I want your opinion‚Äù. 
‚Äã‚ÄãReggie loaded it into his glass stem and brought it to his lips, puffing and twisting as he licked the flame onto the crack ever so gently, like a true professional. Watching him smoke, I immediately knew he was no stranger to cocaine, maybe even more experienced than me. I had only been smoking coke for 2 years, and before that, I had only sniffed powder maybe 20 times in my life. Sniffing was cool but I never liked how much it fucked up my nostrils, or the way I would claw at the bedsheets as the sun came up, unable to sleep or get comfortable enough to relax. Smoking coke, however, was entirely different for me. The high was powerful, euphoric, even sexual, and it was short lived. I could smoke coke and eat pizza at the same time. I could fall asleep with ease after smoking, sometimes I had even slept holding the pipe in my hand. I didnt crave it when it was gone, moreover, I could actually sleep with it in my pocket, if I wanted or needed to. It took discipline, but sometimes that coke I had was my only way of earning any cash, and so smoking it was out of the question. Sure, Id think about it, wanting to get high. But I figured if I was unable to control myself, I was nothing more than a feen and a crackhead, and I didnt want to be that. So I learned to hustle, hold work, make moves, and survive. I was always going to survive. That much was certain.
‚Äã‚Äã
‚Äã‚ÄãReggie finished hitting the pipe, closed his eyes as he held it in, exhaled a giant plume of acrid smoke, opened his eyes and starred at me for a moment, unable to speak. I began to chuckle. 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúI know that look‚Äù I said. 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúKid, holy fuck. HOLY FUCK. Yo you really just cooked this shit?!‚Äù Reggie said, in disbelief. 
‚Äã‚ÄãThere were 4 or 5 other people in Matts room, plus Amy, Matt, and EC, a point guard I played basketball with on my JV high school team. The room hushed, everyone stopping their conversations to see what Reggie was ‚ÄúHoly Fuck‚Äù-ing about. 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúYo this kid is a fucking GENIUS! He is a beast! Bro you gotta cook my shit for me!‚Äù he said, taking a bag out of his pocket and handing it to me. 
‚Äã‚ÄãFrom that moment on, I was no longer the ‚Äúnew kid‚Äù in the homeless food chain. I was the chef, and it was not long before my name was ringing in the streets. I also was no longer homeless, technically. Reggie found out I was on the street and immediately told me I was always welcome to crash at his baby moms crib, up in the apartments on Independence Drive. 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúWhat apartments on Independence?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúI never heard of nothing up there but Shepleys and the spot where them kids burned and buried that body.‚Äù
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúOh yeah kid! Two apartment buildings, 3 stories tall. You‚Äôll see.‚Äù he said.
‚Äã‚Äã
‚Äã‚ÄãReggie and I got close. Reggie had the gift of gab, like me. He could finesse you and get you to do what he wanted, whether you knew it or not. He liked me because I was honest and I was real, not pretending to be a hustler like so many of the kids on Cape Cod. I had been places, traveled, lived and worked elsewhere. So had he. We had a lot in common. 
‚Äã‚ÄãIn high school Reggie had been a track star. He could run like the fucking wind. He was so fast and had so much stamina, he was also famous for outrunning every cop that had tried to chase him on foot. I shit you not, one night he and I were smoking coke in a shitty hotel room up near the mall, and we decided we wanted another half gram to smoke. But neither of us had a ride to go get it, and the dealer was about 2 miles from us down Route 28. Reggie said ‚ÄúFuck it, I‚Äôll run.‚Äù And he got up, left the room, and ran to the crack man, bought the half gram, and ran back. It took him all of 25 minutes. I was impressed. 
‚Äã‚ÄãReggie had Jacob, his son, with Patty, their only child. Patty, Jacob, and Pattys two adult children from her previous marriage, Geoffrey and Courtney, lived in a 3 bedroom apartment in Independence Park. Literally the only apartment ‚Äúhigh-rises‚Äù on cape cod, there were two buildings at the time, each 3 stories, each floor holding like 8 apartments. All in all, probably about 50 units. The apartments were brand new, and I started living there with them full time, first on the floor in the living, then on the couch, then eventually in Geoff and Jacob‚Äôs room.
‚Äã‚Äã
‚Äã‚ÄãThere were two Amys I met in Hytown. Amy my street mom was first. Later, right around the beginning of May, Reggie and I walked down past the high school to a row of condos where Amy #2 lived. 
‚Äã‚ÄãAmy #2 was a petite blond in her early 30s. From the outside, her condo looked really nice, and I was intrigued to see the inside and meet this girl when we walked up the driveway. Reggie opened the screen door, knocked, and then announced himself as he opened the actual door and walked into the living room. I followed behind, slowly and cautiously. Reggie was street smart, and he could fight, but sometimes he was too focused on getting high, and he moved sloppy. I was always careful, moving with more purpose, constantly on alert. I knew how things could happen. I had been in some situations that almost cost me my life, and some that almost cost me my freedom, and a few where I narrowly escaped with both. 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúAmy!!! Where you at girl!‚Äù Reggie yelled, coming back out of the kitchen and bounding up the stairs to the second floor. I just chilled in the living room, standing next to the fireplace where I could see both doors, front and back. 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúIm up here‚Äù I heard a muffled voice squeal, in a very valley girlish tone.
‚Äã‚ÄãEventually Reggie and Amy came down and he introduced us. 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúSo, he said you wanted some dope, right?‚Äù she asked me as we sat down at her dining room table. 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúYeah, he told me you had a plug for some flame - you got a tester though?‚Äù I asked.
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúWhats a tester?‚Äù she said, looking at me puzzled. 
‚Äã‚ÄãI sighed, and said ‚ÄúLook, I‚Äôm not buying shit until I see what it is.‚Äù 
‚Äã‚ÄãAmy scoffed, and then stalled a few minutes, waiting to see if I would break and give up my cash without a fuss. I didnt say another word. Reggie eventually took the cue.
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúHe has the cash Aim, he isnt a junkie shitbox. He spends bread and he moves work, I have been with him, this kid is a hustler.‚Äù 
‚Äã‚ÄãAmy looked at me again, stood up and went upstairs. A few minutes later she returned with a bag of brown powder. 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúThis what it looks like. Check it out.‚Äù she said, handing it to me. 
‚Äã‚ÄãI opened it up and smelled it: vinegar filled my nostrils. I kept my poker face on, but inside I was jumping up and down with excitement. This was real dope, not fentanyl cut into powdered sugar. 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúYeah, it looks straight‚Äù I said. I handed her $50, and she immediately barked out ‚ÄúBut you are going to hook me up too, right!?!?‚Äù
‚Äã‚ÄãI nodded in confirmation. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm never stingy.‚Äù
‚Äã‚Äã
‚Äã‚ÄãAmy got her bag of brand new needles and handed one to me. Reggie piped in ‚ÄúI want one too kid.‚Äù
‚Äã‚ÄãI looked up at him in disbelief. Reggie didnt have a dope habit. He loved cocaine even more than I did, but he never really got into opiates. 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúBro are you serious?‚Äù I asked, confused. 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúAbsolutely! I do it every once in a while, just not often, so I dont catch a habit.‚Äù
‚Äã‚ÄãI scooped about a point of dope into Reggie‚Äôs spoon, and a point into Amy‚Äôs. 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúIs that straight‚Äù I asked Amy, and she nodded in agreement. 
‚Äã‚ÄãI scooped about double what I gave them into my spoon. 
‚Äã‚ÄãI had been sniffing pills and heroin for almost 20 years, but I hadn‚Äôt injected anything until about 3 days previous. Actually, the day Sean beat me for my $40, I shot up a suboxone strip in the bus station bathroom. That was my first injection. I had always been vehemently against using needles, but homeless and broke and dope sick, I felt like it didnt matter anymore. When you go to the hospital, does the doctor give you medicine orally because thats the best route of administration? No, they put a butterfly in your arm and inject it into your blood stream. 
‚Äã‚ÄãIts not so much the injecting of drugs that is so bad, its so much of the shit associated with injecting. Like not knowing what your doing for example, when you first start with the needle. 
‚Äã‚ÄãAmy looked over at my spoon and saw my cotton. 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúAre you serious! Hahahaha! Look at the size of this kids cotton!!!‚Äù she scoffed. 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúWhat the fuck is wrong with my cotton?‚Äù I shot back.
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúI mean its fucking HUGE dude!‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúDo you even know what your doing?‚Äù
‚Äã‚ÄãReggie jumped in ‚ÄúHe just started a few days ago shooting. He‚Äôs still learning, Aim. Dont be a bitch.‚Äù
‚Äã‚ÄãMy cotton was huge. I was terrified of getting a particle in my needle. Funny how those fears dissipated over time. A few months later I was shooting everything I came across; coke, crack, MDMA, amphetamine salt, morphine, hydromorphone, the list goes on.
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúWhat the fuck ever‚Äù I mumbled, drawing the dope water into my needle. ‚ÄúMind your business.‚Äù
‚Äã‚ÄãI tied off my arm and started to do my shot. I hit first, which was funny since I was the newbie. Shortly after, Reggie asked Amy to help him. 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúWill you fix this for me Amy, I cant fucking do it.‚Äù 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúSure I got you honey‚Äù Amy said and she took his rig, pulled the dope water into it from his spoon, and flicked it, checking it in the light above the table.
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúCan you hit me too?‚Äù Reggie asked. 
‚Äã‚ÄãI finished my shot as she began to do Reggie‚Äôs for him. The dope was good, really good. I was soaking in a warm bath of honey and back rubs from naked nympho angels. I lit a cigarette and watched Amy stick Reggie and plunge the entire shot into his arm. As I watched her plunge the shot, I realized how dark and brown the water was, and how much of it was in the needle. Looked to me like almost 100 cc‚Äôs, a GIANT shot for someone who only does heroin every once in a while. 
‚Äã‚ÄãShe stepped back from Reggie and sat back down in her seat, and Reggie‚Äôs eyes were closed. His head immediately tilted back and I knew that something was not right.
‚Äã‚ÄãAmy was sitting with her legs crossed in her chair,  searching her thighs for a place to inject her shot. 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúAmy where is the Narcan I asked you about?‚Äù I said, my voice tense. ‚ÄúSomething aint right. Reggie! YO! YO REG!‚Äù I yelled, standing up out of my chair.
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúHes fine. Relax. Chill the fuck out man.‚Äù Amy said, not even looking up from her legs. 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúNo, hes not.‚Äù I barked, as I made my way around the table to Reggie. He was gargling and his eyes were rolled all the way back in his head. I shook him. I slapped his face. I threatened him.
‚Äã‚ÄãPanic and adrenaline arrived, and now I was getting serious. 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúAmy, WHERE IS THE NARCAN.‚Äù I demanded. 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúI dont know man, fucking chill out, I‚Äôll find it when I‚Äôm done doing my shot.‚Äù she said, still searching her thighs for a spot to do her shot. 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúBITCH. I will fucking take your shit and slap the fuck out of you. Get the narcan RIGHT NOW. Dont fucking test me. You dont know me.‚Äù my voice low and calm. 
‚Äã‚ÄãAmy threw her needle down onto the table in front of her, jumping up out of her chair. 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúOh my god, fine, you fucking asshole. Jesus christ, fucking newbies.‚Äù she said as she walked into the kitchen, reached on top of the fridge, and grabbed two narcan nasal spray kits. 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúHere, are you happy now?‚Äù she said as she handed them to me. 
‚Äã‚ÄãReggie wasnt breathing. His lips were getting blue. He was foaming a little out of the crease of his mouth.
‚Äã‚ÄãI hadnt ever seen an overdose before. I hadnt ever used narcan either. I ripped open one of the boxes, and assembled it as quickly as I could read the directions. I put the tip in Reggie‚Äôs nostril and squeezed it down. WOOOSH, a big spritz of narcan liquid right up his left nostril. I stepped back and he coughed a bit, his head no longer laying back limp. I prepared to hit his right nostril with another spritz, but suddenly he opened his eyes and starred at me, looking dazed and confused. 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúBro, you fucking OD‚Äôed‚Äù I said, and I let out a long sigh of relief.
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúWhat dude? Thats fucking crazy‚Ä¶.‚Äù he said, looking around trying to get his bearings. 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúAnd this bitch was gonna let you die.‚Äù I said, pointing at Amy. She was still searching for a vein. 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúNo I wasn‚Äôt motherfucker!‚Äù she protested. ‚ÄúYou were overreacting! He was FINE! He was just nodded out!‚Äù 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúYeah, nodded out and not breathing right?‚Äù I countered. 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúReally kid, I wasnt breathing?‚Äù Reggie asked. 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúYour lips were blue.‚Äù I said, matter of factly. ‚ÄúShe just didnt want to be interrupted, she hasnt gotten her shot.‚Äù
‚Äã‚ÄãReggie looked at Amy and shook his head in disgust.
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúWOW‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúJust‚Ä¶. WOW.‚Äù
‚Äã‚ÄãAmy never looked up, she just kept looking at her legs, searching for a vein.
‚Äã‚Äã
‚Äã‚ÄãIts fair to say Amy #2 was someone I had no respect for, for reasons I think are obvious. But her roommate was the source of the heroin, and it was fire, so I ended up going to Amy‚Äôs condo a lot. Reggie liked Amy but I didnt understand why. It wasnt for her looks. She was that type of girl who was probably really hot in high school and then got turned out on drugs in her expensive college. She would shoot cocaine and stand in her bathroom for insane periods of time, picking at her face. Some people are pickers, not just meth heads. Its a horrible ‚Äúgeek‚Äù to have, in my opinion. Her face was constantly covered in scabs and bleeding holes. As was the majority of her limbs. 
‚Äã‚ÄãI learned that Amy‚Äôs father was how she afforded the condo. He paid for everything. He would come by once a week, the same day and time , for 10-15 minutes. His visit was really just to hand Amy cash for the week. The rest of the bills he took care of without her participation. Her ‚Äúroommate‚Äù was really just her drug dealer, living in the second bedroom, for free. He would sell her the coke and dope when she had money, and when she was out, he would crumb her with just enough to keep her from going ape shit. I never actually saw his face, which was something I respected. Smart not to be seen. 
‚Äã‚Äã
‚Äã‚ÄãA few weeks later, Reggie and I were out running together as usual, and we ended up at Amy‚Äôs for some reason, I cant remember why. Once we got there, we wanted to smoke crack, so I told Reggie to see if Amy could get us a $40 piece. 
‚Äã‚ÄãAmy told us that she had to order it, her roommate wasn‚Äôt home. So she made a call and we sat downstairs waiting. When dude arrived, Amy was upstairs in her bathroom, like always, and dude didnt even look in our direction as he ran up the stairs to her. Later, he ran back down the stairs and out the front door. Reggie and I looked at each other, and then we both stood up and headed upstairs to find out what had happened to our $40. We found Amy in her bathroom. 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúWhats up?‚Äù Reggie asked her. ‚ÄúDid you get it?‚Äù
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúYeah, here you go.‚Äù she said, handing him a folded piece of paper. 
‚Äã‚ÄãHe opened it up and looked at the contents, and then looked at me. 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶.‚Äù I asked, peering into the fold. It was about $5 worth of crack, if that. Definitely NOT $40 worth, not even $20. What was in the paper was enough for one person to smoke a half hit, basically a giant tease and not even worth doing.
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúNo, this is not going fly‚Äù I said to Amy. ‚ÄúNot even fucking close Amy. Give me my shit. You do not want to try this game with me, you will lose, I‚Äôm trying to tell you.‚Äù 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúThats all they gave me!!! What do you want me to do?!!?‚Äù Amy yelled, slamming her tweezers onto the bathroom counter. ‚ÄúI mean I cant force him to give me more, can I?‚Äù
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúYou could have called us upstairs before he walked out the door Amy.‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYou know Im not letting this ride. You can either call him back here, or you can give me my $40 back and keep this crumb you are trying to give me. One way or another though, I‚Äôm getting whats mine.‚Äù
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúI cant call him back here, he doesnt have a phone!‚Äù she screamed, and I knew then she was trying to game me. I started to pace and noticed something sitting on the hamper full of dirty clothes. It was a brand new iPhone 6, like BRAND NEW. The 6 had just come out that same week. Again, Amy‚Äôs father.
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúOk well if you are gonna rob me then I guess I have no choice‚Äù I said, picking up the iPhone and showing her I had it in my hands. ‚ÄúFuck it, I bet this is worth more than $40 anyway.‚Äù I said, as I started walking out the bathroom to the stairs. ‚ÄúReg, we out.‚Äù I yelled.
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúNO!!‚Äù Amy screamed, chasing behind me. ‚ÄúGIVE THAT BACK!‚Äù
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúNot until you give me my money or my work Amy, I‚Äôm not playing with you‚Äù I said. 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúFINE ASSHOLE‚Ä¶. ‚Äú she said, reaching into her bra and pulling a baggie out. She handed me the baggie and I looked at it closely. ‚ÄúIts all there asshole‚Äù she hissed.
‚Äã‚ÄãI handed her the iPhone and started making my way out of the house. 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúIm gonna call the cops on you, you fucking ASSHOLE!‚Äù she yelled after us. 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúYeah, you do that you dumb bitch.‚Äù I said as I opened the screen door and walked out, Reggie behind me. 
‚Äã‚Äã
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúWhat in the actual fuck bro‚Ä¶‚Äù I said, turning to Reggie as we hustled down the driveway into the foggy night. In my backpack I had a stolen .38 caliber Smith &amp; Wesson revolver. In my nut sack I had a large quantity of ECP, probably around 10 grams, what we called a stick in the commonwealth.

He doesn't have a car, but has a lot of errands to run so every morning we send a text asking if he needs anything today and at any point in the day if he needs something (considering we're not already busy of course) we drive over and usually end up spending the day with him. We'll run and do whatever he needs, then we chill at his place for hours and hours, watching movies, doing lines, whatever. 

Awhile back we had a scare where he asked us to run something to his girl. He hands me a grocery bag and we run it down, but later that day he called accusing us of stealing from him. Apparently he wrapped it up a certain way and it wasn't the same when she got it. We explained we'd never do that, but told him if something is missing we may have dropped it or whatever, we'd pay for whatever was gone, but we promised we didn't steal (we didn't even open the bag). After told him that he believed us and now we're cool again. 

Today my best friend was sick as fuck and has to work tonight, I was trying to help him out but we don't get paid till tonight (technically it's tomorrow at 1-2AM but still) and he doesn't get paid til Friday. Today J called us over cause he needed us to send his ex-wife some money (he can't use WU or anything on his own because he sent some other people money so much they thought he was laundering money) and get his dry cleaning. We went and did that and after when we got back I asked if it'd be possible to get a front to help out our friend. Before I was even able to finish asking he grabbed his shit and started pulling out a .5. I started to explain that I'll pay him tonight and my friend will pay me back later right away he stopped me a said ""y'all don't need to go through all this explaining and shit. Some people gotta explain but not y'all. Do you need something for yourselves too?"" 

Only reason I'm making this post is because it's a nice feeling to be able to have a dealer like this when all I hear from friends or read on here is people getting fucked or having to bend over backwards to get their shit.

Edit: Figured I'd add some clarification because of the criticisms of our actions here

1. We *NEVER* do anything we don't want to. Multiple times we've been asked to run drugs somewhere and we say no (with no argument from J) every time because we're not comfortable having drugs in the car with us (the only time we have dope in the car is on the way home after a pick-up)

2. The Western Union isn't going to some random person for some random reason. It always goes to his Ex-wife to help her take care of his son. Also important to say that we knew her for years before we ever met him, and I had sent her money through WU at least twice before we even knew J.

3. J never carries *ANYTHING* illegal in the car. I'm not saying this just because I trust his word and he says he's clean, I *know* this for a fact. 

4. We're not being manipulated into doing anything. There are plenty of times we're unavailable or don't want to go anywhere and don't help when he needs it. He's okay with this. To us it's no different than helping your buddy run errands while his car is in the shop, just not temporary. 

5. We are compensated *very* well for what we do. To some, a G might not seem worth it, but when a G lasts you 2 or 3 days, and you're getting a G at the very least every other day, it supports your entire habit (we literally haven't paid for dope in 3 months. Not once). Also no matter how much or how little driving we do, if we drive him somewhere, we leave with a full gas tank. On top of all of that, when we're done with errands, we go to his place, do lines, watch movies, eat his food, smoke his cigarettes, etc and just hang out with him. 

6. No he isn't fucking my fiance. ",1534375013.0

I am a pain patient and normally take about 90 10/325 vicodon a month (rx'ed 120,but since on Cymbalta I've cut back a lot),   25mcg fentanyl patches,  and 120mg Cymbalta.  

I normally get rid of 30-45 of my hydrocodone a month to my guy that trades me various other stuff ie: blow,  kitties,  or Molly etc.  Sometimes because I will delay in replacing my patch in time,  I have an extra 1-2patches at end of month that I trade as well. 

Anyhow,  my brother passed away and I was really disorganized and had a box of my patches in my back seat.  I only gave ""my guy""  rides the day they vanished and knew he took em. Anyhow he never owned up to it,  but said he felt badly for me (yeah total bs but whatever too late now) he gave me about 60mg of methadone that I slowly used over like 3days which helped wd's but I was still in agony from pain. 
He has offered to get me another 200mg bottle of methadone or offered me heroine,  which I initially refused. 
Since I am in severe withdrawals now,  I am considering everything but only want enough to get me through the next two weeks until I get me new scripts.  Since in severe pain and withdrawals,  I am eating through my hydrocodone way too fast now and only have like 25 left. 
After I get my scripts I am done with him and not ever gonna get rid of my extra again.  
What would you suggest I get from him to get me through the next two weeks?

Thank you for your time posting and responding. Withdrawals are the fucking worst.

I know that they aren't opiates but I myself, and many others seem to be getting these prescribed more and more lately with their opiates. Always good to know about any interactions and such.

Which of these has less side effects or adverse affects. Which one is more dangerous in the short term, long term, etc.

I know most people prefer the effects of pregabalin over gabapentin and I myself have only tried gabapentin and think its ok recreationally. My goal is not necessarily the one that feels better but rather the one that is least toxic or damaging to my body.

I know that they both can have a ton of weird side effects and thats why I'm asking. Is one more likely to cause ulcers, or liver damage, kidney damage, heart problems, etc. I have a bunch of stomach issues so knowing which one is harder on the stomach would be helpful. Basically I want to minimize the harm I cause myself by taking one of these with my subs or alone. They really seem to help my anxiety so I'd like to stick with whichever is the least toxic. Thanks!

My abdominal pain was getting painful so I decided it was time to just take them because this shit obliviously was not coming out on it‚Äôs own.

I then was on kratom during this time off street drugs, which is such a shitty habit, I have tapered down to less than a gram and almost am ready to say goodbye to it too. Last night I had a dream I found some old paraphenelia caked in this fire purple heroin I once copped off DNMs and I tried scraping it off to snort and it got mixed with plastic scrapings, etc, and I just have up. 

I saw my ex dealer and did not even think of copping, i see all the people on the streets i used to go to to cold cop and even when i feel down i dont want to grab. My pain issues are finally getting better slowly (i made no progress while using for a variety of reasons), and i am starting to get my brain back-- i never realized how dumb street drugs made me. I can think clearly now and feel like i, escaping the black grips of this affliction. 

Beyond all that, i still have some deep admiration for the drug. I came to hate street drugs (cut up poisoned fentanyl shit), not HEROIN, which is still such a beautiful molecule to me. I cannot say I will never use again, but I will never buy a street drug from a dealer and go into that world, if i can help it. 

The main lesson I learned is that 90% of my excess misery, my health problems, family, financial, everything, was the result of using street drugs. I am convinced if I had had access to pharma grade sterile heroin I would have been far safer, happier, healthier. This past years of my life redpilled me on so much, on society, law and order, attitudes, fairweather friends, etc. I honestly am almost thankful to have gone through it but I know that is rationalizing wasted time. 

I am glad to be free of that shit, but at the same time, I am almost giddy at thinking of how amazing the poppy flower is. Truly given to us by a compassionate God, only humans took it and mutated it into a black tentacled fuck like humans always tend to do. So when I see the 12 steppers, the NA freaks preaching their bullshit about drugs are bad mmmkay and how we are all powerless, I see that as just another fault of human concious. To me, these people view the drug in a box corrupted by societial influence and self hate.

So let‚Äôs dive right in!!!

Life has been really good as of late... my son is 14 months old, and getting bigger every day. He is so much fun and we do everything together. We just went to Ocean City, Maryland last week with the family and we had an amazing time. My family life has been great, especially with my beautiful fianc√©. My band is doing great, too. We played our first festival and had an awesome time. I been playing Fortnite lol (groundTERRAPIN on PS4) but I just cut down. I was going hard on it playing all day, every day. Now I play like a round or two a day. Lol also cut down heavily on scratch offs.

Drug wise, I still smoke bud. I been vaping oils more than smoking buds, but it‚Äôs like the same thing. I also take psychedelics or adderall occasionally, but I haven‚Äôt touched crack, coke, or meth or any other hard drugs in a long, long time. Drinking, I can take it or leave it. I have a few here and there when I‚Äôm out and it‚Äôs there. I‚Äôm down to 48mg a day with the methadone, and dropping. I been on a taper from 53mg and I‚Äôm coming down 2mg every 2 weeks as of right now. So pretty soon I‚Äôll be off that, too. Life is good.

If I can get off dope, anyone can. I was a straight heroin/crack addict and I thought I‚Äôd never stop. I thought I‚Äôd die an addict. And I almost did, thanks be to God I got a second chance. I almost didn‚Äôt take the second chance either. So glad I did. Life can be amazing if you let it. Anyone struggling, hit me up.

Going to a music festival and worried about #4 powder being destroyed in a hot car.,"So im going to a music festival this weekend and im mortified about the possibility of my stash getting destroyed in the heat. This is a camping festival so i was planing on locking anything valuable in the car instead of just putting it in my tent and hoping no sneaky hippies raid my tent during the music.

My friend and i have about 10 bundles of number 4 heroin to use and enjoy throughout the weekend. If we lock it in the car with 90 degree weather, naturally the car is going to bake like an oven with the windows all shut, will the dope survive? should we be worried about it clumping into useless junk or worse off?

I was thinking of putting it in an airtight mason jar to avoid humidity exposure, what do you think? Thank you for your time and consideration. Need some veteran advise on this one, please help if you can!

TLDR: would #4 heroin be safe in an airtight mason jar locked inside of a car in 90 degree weather for the weekend? or would it be destroyed? What would you do in my situation, camping at a music festival for the weekend.

Sometimes the game was out of order and waiting to be repaired. As we all slowly ran out of money and scrambled to find more to keep playing and keep up with the increase in price it became harder and harder. So we decided to take breaks whether it was forced upon us by being incarcerated from stealing, or the arcade closing at night, or even loved ones telling us to come home. At night we would dream of continuing on the quest for the high score, some of us knowing we'd never beat it or even reach it.

Other people begging for change, I'm one of the lucky ones to have a job and can get my moment in the sun once more.

Well after a lot of people did the same batch in philly, and a shitload of them ended up in the hospital, they tested the dope and found that it had synthetic cannabis/k2/spice in the dope.

That dope with spice in it does not feel good, it does not relieve wd symptoms, and when i got it a dozen different times it made me trip so bad that i shouldve been in the e.r. 

Its been showing up in dope for the past 3 years now that ive experienced, and the people making or cutting the dope must think they are making the dope feel stronger by adding that shit into it. Maybe if everyone that buys dope would tell their dealer whats been happening, it might go up the chain of dealers until it gets to the people responsible for putting it in. If they dont already know its bad and ruins the dope completely, maybe if enough people tell em they wont use it anymore.

At least alert all the other addicts you know about whats happening, and to start slow with new batches so us users dont die from that shit. Its gotta be lethal to inject too much spice, and i doubt theres anything the e.r. could even do for a spice overdose. All i know is that shit is horrible.

97chho,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/97chho/a_flower_of_black_blood_bloomed_through_the_milky/,28,https://redd.it/97chho,ASavageLost,A flower of black blood bloomed through the milky morphine mixture in my syringe and disappeared back into the vein from which it came.,"As much as I‚Äôd like to tell you the half ounce of that potent brown powder lasted as long as it should have, it didn‚Äôt. Rufus and I tore into it every time we woke up from a nod. Worse than that though between the two of us, one would always brag about the quality. If he didn‚Äôt brag about how good our dope was to some poor street junkie cooking up the typical vinegary, black goo in the bottom half of a coke can or spoon on the sidewalk, then I did. We traded hits for packs of cigarettes or five bucks or meth we didn‚Äôt really want or pills we didn‚Äôt need. So, sooner than it should have been, it was gone.

The morning after it ran out we sat in the park and did some of the dilaudid and morphine we‚Äôd obtained. It was the last day of the month. We‚Äôd have food stamps to trade soon, but until then, we would be bored and wait for someone to come along with a lick for us to hit or something to pass the time. Soon enough, Black Irish walked up to us.

Now, Black Irish was neither black nor was he Irish, at least not so far as I could tell. He looked like a Nazi after the war who had let his hair grow out. Our interaction with him was always the same. He offered us rancid protein shakes in bottles he‚Äôd purchased at 42 cents a bottle from the discount grocery store, where a package of deli cut turkey breast might look more like a package of green roast beef. That was Black Irish‚Äôs thing. Well, it was one of his things.

He also liked to tell people how much he loved them. Sometimes, he would mix his proclamation of love towards you in with veiled threats to your safety, but he said it a lot. It was part of the Christian community he was in and out of it so frequently, a rehab church. He was a self-appointed leader there and disciple maker when he wasn‚Äôt relapsing. Eventually, he started saying that he‚Äôd been called to teach other men how to relapse and come back from it. Black Irish was always angry, walking around with two clenched fists like hammer heads and gritting his teeth, but out of some religious duty, he always told us he loved us. 

Rufus and I had just lit cigarettes. Black Irish stood at our feet looking down at us. He eyed our cigarettes and licked his lips. His fists clenched, and he said,

‚ÄúHey, guys. I love you.‚Äù

‚ÄúHey, Black Irish.‚Äù We responded trying to hide our disappointment in having to talk to him.

‚ÄúHow‚Äôs it going?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre doing alright.‚Äù I never asked him how he was.

‚ÄúGood. I‚Äôm happy for you. Well, yeah, I‚Äôm doing pretty good myself.‚Äù I rolled my eyes. I didn‚Äôt want to know. ‚ÄúJust, you know, got back to my ministry at Hope Outreach downtown.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. We know where it is.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood. Good. You guys should come down sometime. I sure do love you guys. Would love to see you come in and come to a service.‚Äù He grunted as the visceral hatred he held in his guts towards us tried to escape his mouth. ‚ÄúReally‚Ä¶really love you guys.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe. Yeah. You know, what? That sounds nice. Maybe we‚Äôll come see you there soon.‚Äù Rufus piped in.

‚ÄúOkay! Looking forward to it.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù

‚ÄúHey. I have a pair of movie tickets here, but I can‚Äôt go to it. I've got work. Would you guys want to go see it?‚Äù Black Irish was always fasting from food or subjecting himself to humiliating employment as penance he decided God had decided for him to do. It never made sense. That‚Äôs how it was with him, though.

‚ÄúGuess so. What is it?‚Äù

‚ÄúSomething about a mine in Alaska or something and women being mistreated there.‚Äù

‚ÄúJeesh. A lighthearted flick, huh?‚Äù

‚ÄúHere.‚Äù He handed us the tickets. ‚ÄúLove you guys. See ya.‚Äù

‚ÄúK. See ya.‚Äù Rufus said.

We walked up to the movie theater. The entrance was part of an outdoor plaza in the mall. There was a large grassy hill where people sat. Kids played with bouncy balls, and parents lay on blankets. Rufus busted out a sticky brown roach and lit it. He took a few puffs, blew the smoke up and passed it to me.

‚ÄúMaybe we shouldn‚Äôt smoke here. There‚Äôs kids.‚Äù

‚ÄúNah..‚Äù He was holding the smoke in and talking. ‚ÄúNah. Just smoke it. We‚Äôll be done in a second.‚Äù

I shrugged. I took a few puffs. Before I could pass it back, I realized the smoke was blowing right towards the families and their kids. Rufus busted up in a fit of coughing. I followed, watery snot spraying out of my nose with the thick grey smoke plumes.  It burned like fire in the back of my nostrils.  We coughed hard. The parents of the children looked at us and shook their heads.

Eventually, we stopped coughing and walked into the theatre. A nerdy high school kid took our tickets and told us where the auditorium was. We had no money for soda and popcorn or any of that, but we did have a 200 milligram Kadian. Rufus and I went to the bathroom. He pulled out a pack of cigarettes and took the cellophane off it. I opened the turquoise gel cap and poured the time release beads into the clear plastic that Rufus was holding open. He pulled out his lighter and crushed the beads against the stall divider. We poured the granulated powder into a cooker, dropped water on it and sucked it back up, half and half.

A flower of black blood bloomed through the milky morphine mixture in my syringe and disappeared back into the vein from which it came. We grunted simultaneously at the rush. I rubbed my face and capped my rig. It wasn‚Äôt a new one, so the needle got caught on the orange plastic cap and bent badly. Rufus watched it happen.

‚ÄúDang! Looks like that one‚Äôs spent.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. Huh? I‚Äôve used worse.‚Äù There were at least six broken needles in my arms. There were seven before that. One had worked itself to the surface so that I could pick it out. The thing is that when they break and you try to grab them, your skin and fat pushes back up and swallows it before you can get it. I smiled and shrugged, dramatically throwing it into the toilet before I flushed it. We laughed and walked out.

In the theater, Rufus found a half-eaten box of popcorn that was cold and soggy. He also rounded up a few old beverages people left behind and mixed them together in the biggest cup. Rufus said it was flat and watery, maybe a mixture of Sprite, root beer and diet Coke. He wasn‚Äôt sure. But took long pulls of it through the straw between chewing the popcorn. The trailers started.

I always liked trailers more than movies. They were shorter. They were more action packed and emotionally stirring than the actual feature films. In high school, I realized that movies worth watching were few and far between. Movies didn‚Äôt do it for me. Most of the time, I was rooting for the good guys to fail and die so I could just go home and start mourning the $11.50 I‚Äôd wasted to see it as soon as possible. The sooner I started grieving it, the sooner I‚Äôd be over it.

Cinematic features had other problems, though, in my eyes. They were terribly unrealistic. And even when the storylines were relatable, I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about how the actors were just acting. I‚Äôd heard about how partnerships or love stories on screen were actually terrible rivalries behind the scenes. They weren‚Äôt friends or in love. Like my life back when I used to go to the movies, before I went back to the streets, it was all fake. That was the most realistic thing about it. People pretended to be friends. They pretended to care. They pretended their lives mattered, and as I sat there watching that movie with Rufus, this was what I thought about. I didn‚Äôt have to worry about him being fake. He was broken like me. He stunk like me. He was filthy like me, but Rufus was also real. Rufus was my friend. He slept through the whole thing.

When we got out of the movie we walked up to see Ally Alcoholic. She was sitting on her bench. Rufus was getting sweet on her like he always did. He asked her if she had a clean, which she did. She gave it over, and we walked back to the spot to do whatever pill we decided to when we got there. It hit me then, the things I‚Äôd forgotten for over a week. I needed to break it to Rufus that he had to stop talking to her. I wondered how‚Äôd he take it. Would he accept it? He had to, or we‚Äôd be in big trouble. There was no second option. The Faceless One had ordered it.",1534282966.0
97cfzd,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/97cfzd/soo_last_week_i_got_kicked_out_of_rehab_for/,17,https://redd.it/97cfzd,mashnote,"Soo last week I got kicked out of rehab for withdrawing too hard. :| sent to jail, motion to revoke probation... anyone experienced something similar/have any idea what might happen to me?","Ok so. I'm hoping my fellow junkies here have maybe been in similar programs and have some idea of how this all might play out. Really if anyone can shed some light, any light, on this clusterf-k predicament... I'd be so grateful... Sorry about the wall of text, it's really a lot of details over a simple thing, just trying not to miss anything...

Last Nov I committed a serious crime for which I am genuinely remorseful. Drove drunk and crashed into an empty parked vehicle - no one was hurt thank god, and insurance covered property damage. This is my 2nd DWI; first was 8 years ago. I pled into ""DWI Court"" which is like a modified probation focused on I guess addiction recovery. It begins with a three month intensive outpatient program - group therapy 9 hours a week, going before the judge every week, etc... and of course random UAs. I have had a serious speedball addiction for a couple years now, so... I pissed dirty... 

They had me sign an agreement saying that I was not to use substances any more, and start having individual sessions with their assigned therapist in addition to everything else, and so on... Long story short I'm a complete idiot and piss dirty a second time at the end of the week. Come Monday my probation officer tells me to get to evening group early in order to drop another UA, because ""in light of the 2nd positive UA, the office will be making a recommendation to the judge, and if this UA comes out negative it will be one thing, if it comes positive it will be something else"". Welp that did it, 3rd positive UA...

So the next day I have court, got to go before the judge. Before court commences, the court officer pulls me aside for a private meeting. She tells me that because of what I'm dirty for (opiates), they're very worried about me. I start crying saying I don't want to be a criminal and I'm very sorry for my actions and want to do what it takes not to do something hurtful like that again (all true)... she tells me it's not even the criminal aspect they're concerned about at this point, it's my health and safety. Says they're referring me to the county-run rehab for a 5 month run. 

It's not too bad, I've had friends that have done it... it's a little similar to jail since it's county run but not even really, I mean the beds and uniforms are similar but the food is better, and super low security... you can technically leave out the door at any time, but it's an automatic state felony for ""absconding"" that carries 2 year sentence, and apparently the sheriffs usually find people in like an hour. My point is, it's better than jail and hey, I fucked up, and hey, I do need help with this addiction, so I was/am down.

So the court officer lady tells me they want me to check in by the following Monday, which is less than a week to get my affairs in order, and that basically if I refuse it would trigger a motion to revoke my probation/all kinds of bad stuff. Then she asked me if I was going to need to be referred to a detox facility first, or at least that's how interpreted her questions at the time, about if I expected to get very very sick. She definitely at least made it clear that they did not expect me to be able to drop this habit on my own, that they did expect me to be detoxing at first. And I said, yeah you're right, and I do expect to get sick, but I don't think it will be anything life-threatening.

Ok. So. I check in to the rehab. Part of my intake was signing a bunch of forms, one of which listed the ""rights"" I have, which included going to the hospital when I want. It was also made clear to me that upon checking in to the rehab, I was switching to a new probation officer that works there at the rehab. I am immediately completely honest with the nurses about my use, expected withdrawal, etc, and with the doctor that examined me the first morning. The girl in the bunk under me is kicking way harder than I am, and I come to learn that she did go to the hospital one of her peak days. 

Anyway, the nurses give me OTC stuff twice a day for my symptoms, Imodium Ibuprofen etc., but it's rough. Come day 3, my dormies are pressuring me to ask to go to the hospital, saying I really don't look good etc. So I do, and the staff basically say they are ""working on it"" for THREE HOURS... my dormies keep telling me it's a violation of my rights and that they got sent right away on request, etc. So they kinda start pressuring the staff on my behalf... three hours later the staff take me to a back room saying all of a sudden that someone needs to be with me at all times, and then finally to another back room, my new PO's office, where I meet my new PO for the first time. Two cops there as well. My new PO tells me there has been a warrant issued for my arrest and that they will be taking me to jail after the ER.

Why? Because ""this facility is not equipped to take care of you. Jail is. This is not a detox facility."" Says that after I'm done detoxing at jail for one or two weeks, I will be returned to the rehab. I'm freaking tf out, saying I don't understand, that I've tried to follow all the rules and be honest and that this is not what I was told before, and that why if the other girls are kicking harder and went, etc... she just says every case is different and that in my case this is what the court ordered. 

The ER gave me a weak Ativan prescription which did follow me to jail, thank god, and to my immense surprise, the next morning the judge DID set a bond for me?! So my BF bails me out. I would've thought they wouldn't let me leave since I was supposed to be finishing my detox there and then return to rehab? But apparently my official ""status"" now is full-blown Motion to Revoke Probation. Guys I am freaking tf out. If I get my probation revoked I could be looking at 180 days in jail to my understanding. My attorney doesn't even understand what happened; he and my family and everyone is basically assuming that I MUST have broken a rule or committed a crime to get a MTRP, he was asking me if I had brought drugs, etc. 

I did have two auxiliary thoughts occur to me. 1) I overheard a conversation right before they took me away to arrest me, where the girl who was kicking hard and went to the hospital, was complaining that someone had ""snitched"" on her for apparently having her dealer meet her at the hospital and using while she was there. So I wonder if that affected how they dealt with me? and, 2) the hospital staff were saying that my readings were actually ok and that my kick wasn't that bad, but it sure felt bad to me, and so I wonder if I was having a panic attack essentially. I had told my therapist in the outpatient program that I have panic attacks ever since my father got charged with four felonies and might spend his life in prison and I've been managing his affairs, and that I was just about to start a Xanax script for my symptoms before I pled into DWI court which does not allow any narcotic meds even prescribed. I wonder if they might consider this anxiety disorder as a mitigating factor.

My next court date is in a week and my attorney thinks I should check in to a 30 day private rehab to kind of do what they wanted me to do, and that he could ""probably"" get the court date pushed back if I did that and use it as a selling point to not revoke my probation. But he also works in a different county and admits he has no idea how this system here works, he's just guessing that would be an option. But I suspect it might ""have"" to be the state-run one... I'm meeting with a local attorney that DOES have experience handling DWI's HERE in this county, tomorrow.

But in the meantime I am still panicking. And yes, using. \*\*I'm not asking for legal advice,\*\* I just want to know if anyone has seen anything remotely similar to this go down, or just if anyone has anything to say at all about this bizarre situation. 

\*\*TLDR:\*\* 2nd DWI, pled into DWI court including IOP, dropped dirty UAs, got referred to state-run rehab and told it would be ok to detox there, got sent to jail from state-run rehab for kicking too hard, now my probation is in ""motion to revoke"" status, freaking tfffff out.",1534282651.0

I do know that because of insurance and  FDA she can't write the same strength again. 

My refill is DUE (28 Days) next Friday. They want to see me THIS Friday due to them being closed next week. She said doc would give me a post-dated script. 

This is my last insurance approved visit as I lost my insurance in 4 weeks. 

I have no opiates in my system. 

I was given dilaudid at the ER for a serious stomach issue. She'll be able to see that.

As I can assume from the posts on the front page you guys are, as you call yourselves, ""opiate enthusiasts""!

Regardless, I would guess some of you guys ~~(maybe most?)~~ have been in contacts with **people in higher up-positions like** the police, maybe even jail, people working at different institutes, social workers and so forth. (edited because worded badly and to be fair insulting, I'm sorry)


I work at a treatment home where the clients are there by their own will while undergoing a sort of replacement therapy for opioid dependence, which means they are on either Buprenorphine or Methadone which is given to them daily while undergoing therapy. 

These guys are mostly ""ex"" criminals in that sense they're not actively doing criminal activity right now. Most of them have gone to criminality to sustain their high use of all kind of substances, mostly opiates. 

Even though they are there by their free will and driven to stay drug-free for reasons like they have kids, they are afraid to die etc., having relapses and not returning to treatment is very usual. Most of the time when they have relapses it's because of anxiety of some sort.

My question to you guys is how can I as a social worker be better at understanding their feelings to mostly opiates and help them in their own will to be drug-free? 

Is it something you'd like to ask me, teach me, etc., feel free, I will try to answer and listen to you all.

Whether you ran out suddenly or it is planned, it **SUCKS** either way. I want you all to hit me with your best tips for getting through that period of time that seems like death. 




##I am mainly looking for tips that deal with: 

**‚Ä¢Nutrition:** how do you keep fed while puking/shitting your guts out? Any specific foods or brands that you SWEAR by that you want on hand if you have a say in the matter?
 
** -** do you utilize vitamin pills/supplements or the like to help maintain nutrition levels? 
How about so-called ""natural remedies""?

**‚Ä¢Comfort:** how do you get through the kicking legs, the horrible body aches and the relentless yawning and tears?

**‚Ä¢The Endless and Incessant Thoughts:** be this the mind numbing boredom, the horrible fiend crave or the deep pit of depression that accompanies the lack of drug. 

***


I am mainly looking for things you can do that do NOT require being given another scrip or drug. 
* This can include if you all feel helped especially by legal CBD and Kratom but they need to **be able to be procured from a store in your neighborhood, not necessarily the internet or illegal means.** *

* Specifically, I don't want to keep hearing to go to the doc to get benzos or methadone or subs or just get weed because let's get real, it just doesn't always work that way. (I will concede to weed but because it isn't legal everywhere, it isn't always the most viable. And yes I do realize that most of our withdrawal are caused by illegal drugs). *

Legal, SAFE, proven tips are mainly what I'm looking for.  Hit me with them and be safe out here friends!

Edit:
I am aware that this is a topic that is pretty widely touched on already here in this sub but I guess I was looking for a little something more, information wise. The general things that are done to make the time easier are pretty well known but I guess I'm looking more for what YOU as an individual find helps you the most. Are there specific brands you go to? Specific exercises and activities you find help ease the ordeal? I have utilized search and very much appreciate the guides but I was hoping to hear more personal experience. Believe me, I've been there and done it. Clean for almost 6months now but there are some aspects about the process that I'm looking to flesh out and gain knowledge over.

Reality forced itself back onto me, no matter how much I didnt want to let it back in. My stomach churned and bubbled and I could taste that watery taste that always precedes that kind of throwing up that doesnt feel good when its over.

This was different. I felt my cold sweat get hot, my forehead dripping big syrupy drops into my clammy palms where it rested.¬†

‚ÄúAre you ok Slim? Slim, talk to me!‚Äù Amy demanded. I looked up at her and then back at the pavement.¬†

As I began to open my mouth, I was planning to try and tell her I was ok. Instead I vomitted onto the pavement where I was kneeling, splashing black bile and stomach acid onto my knees and hoodie sleeves. And then I was lost, puking over and over, so hard and with such fury I couldnt even stop to try and inhale, and I began to suffocate as my bodily functions betrayed me. I would gasp and cough and snot would shoot out of my nostrils. My eyes were crying, not that I was crying for the lost $40, or the fact I had been disowned by the only family I had left willing to put up with me, or the fact I was kneeling in snow and ice and now puke and stomach acid, with no home and no friends I trusted. I was crying because I was vomiting so hard the pressure was forcing all of the fluid in my head out.¬†

Jeff was from Atlanta, by way of Haiti. He had the darkest skin I have ever seen on a black man, and his dreads were long. He wasn‚Äôt anywhere near as tall as me, but he had that kind of frame that I knew meant he could probably murder someone with his bare hands, if he had good reason to do so.

I had heard about him from Amy, and then again from Matt when I sat on the filthy wood floor in his tiny room, smoking cigarettes and just being happy I wasnt outside in the snow.¬†

‚ÄúBro, he came down here last weekend and we sat in this room for like 36 hours, doing nothing but getting fucking GEEKED!‚Äù Matt said, smiling and throwing a fist in the air in triumph.¬†

‚ÄúNo bullshit he had like a quarter of soft, maybe more, and we smoked the whole shit.‚Äù Matt said, lighting another Marlboro red.¬†

‚ÄúWho chef‚Äôed it though?‚Äù I asked, hoping I might find an opportunity to use my most prized skill. I had learned to cook crack cocaine in Richmond. Sure, like everyone else, I had first tried to learn to cook crack from the internet, googling and reading different TEKs and watching youtube videos. Cocaine is expensive. Cooking it into crack so it could be smoked required experience and skill, and it was easy to fuck it up. I had personally ruined at least a few grams trying to learn. Sometimes it came out ok, smokeable at least. Sometimes it was a complete loss, depending on the quality of the powder. So when one of my boys from Richmond had began to use my kitchen to cook his shit, I kept asking him to teach me. At first, he refused. He would call me, usually about once a week, and say ‚ÄúYo I need to use the kitchen.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúOk, come through, Im here.‚Äù I would reply, excited to get the crack he would give me for letting him do his thing in my house. The first couple of times he came over and cooked, I tried to nonchalantly watch him, but he would turn around and say ‚ÄúYo please dont crowd me bro, I‚Äôll be done in a minute.‚Äù I thought about and realized that I would probably want to be left alone too, since he was in the process of converting his $900 investment into $1800, and if he fucked it up, it would be a catastrophic financial loss. The more I thought about it, I began to change how I behaved around him when he was there to cook. I started keeping the kitchen clean all the time, instead of leaving dirty dishes all in the sink and on the counters. When he came over the 3rd and 4th time to cook, I had the water in the pot simmering, the pyrex clean and dry, fresh unopened boxes of Arm & Hammer on the counter, next to a clean knife, spoon, and fork I had flattened.¬†

He noticed these preparations and then one day he showed up and said ‚ÄúYou are going to help me this time, you cool with that?‚Äù¬†

Learning how to cook cocaine is not done overnight. Sure, the process isnt too complicated: you add sodium bicarbonate to cocaine hydrochloride, usually in a ratio of about 1:3, then some water, which you heat until the bicarbonate reacts with the cocaine and begins to bond to it. Once the reaction is about done, you remove the heat, let it cool, and remove the new crack cocaine from the water, let it dry, and its ready to smoke.¬†

But there were so many variables. How much baking soda to add depended on the quality of the cocaine powder. How much had the cocaine powder been cut, and what adulterants had been added was a major variable as well. Learning to identify the quality of cocaine powder required experience and knowing what to look for. Was the cocaine powder still hard and in chunks, or ‚Äúblocked up‚Äù as I called it, or was it just a bag of powder, like a ziploc full of flour? Did it have a shine to it, little crystals that reacted to the light? If it was blocked up, did it have a grain when you broke a piece off, like a slab of granite, or was it repress, which meant someone had cut it already and then put it in a hydraulic press and squeezed it back together, making it appear to be higher quality than it was. The cocaine game, like most of the drug game, is complex and dynamic, and people were always trying to find new and innovative ways to make more money.

I learned all these skills and nuances, just like any apprentice shadowing a mastered artist, during my time in Richmond. My boy that taught me to cook ended up becoming one of my closest friends, and he taught me so much about the game and life in general. When I moved back up north, I gave him my favorite possession, a digital jewelers scale that measured accurately to the thousands, 3 digits to the right of the 0.¬†

‚ÄúI want you to make a million dollars with this, Fortune 5000‚Äù I said when I handed it to him, using the nickname I had given him. Cooking crack was something I did better than anyone else I had ever met since I had left Richmond, better even than the d boys I met in the projects or on the block in New Bedford. I was Heisenberg of that crack shit.¬†

‚ÄúSlim can cook like a mad scientist‚Äù Amy said to Matt. ‚ÄúYou gotta see my bro in action.‚Äù

‚ÄúReally?‚Äù Matt said, looking a bit puzzled. ‚ÄúDude can you show me? Because I suck at it. I mean I can do it, but I dunno, its like its always a little bit off, I only get lucky and get it right every once in a while.‚Äù

‚ÄúSounds like you probably use too much water‚Äù I said, snubbing out my cigarette in the ash tray. ‚ÄúIts easy to cook, but its not easy to do it the right way every time. I can help you though, I‚Äôd be happy to.‚Äù

‚ÄúSweet!‚Äù Matt squeaked in excitement. ‚ÄúIm gonna text Jeff now, see whats up.‚Äù¬†

A few minutes passed, and then Jeff replied to Matt‚Äôs text. He was working, and woudnt be home til late that night. I asked Matt ‚ÄúDo you have any money? I mean I can call someone if you want, thats no probem.‚Äù I was hoping he did, cause I needed to make every penny I could, and any chance to middle man a package meant I would profit in some way. It did not matter the drug, the amount, or the circumstances around the transaction. I could out-hustle anyone, I was a scorpion, cold, calculated, and dangerous when I needed to be. I kept a box of sandwich bags, a box of baking soda, a bottle of miralax, and a bottle of benefiber in my backpack with me, 24/7. I was always prepared to cook, cut, and bag up. It was how I survived.¬†

‚ÄúNo, no money, but Im telling you bro, Jeff has a shitload of coke. He had a fucking black trash bag of it when he walked in here this weekend.‚Äù

I would come to find out much later, that Jeff was perpetrating a huge lie to everyone he met. He talked about being ‚Äúplugged in‚Äù, and because he was from ATL, most people just assumed he must have been what he claimed to be. He claimed he got his bricks in the mail every month. He claimed he was connected to Meech and BMF. He claimed he had a fucking arsenal of guns. What I ended up learning much later that summer, was that Jeff was a pathological liar and a bullshit artist, a fraud so full of shit his eyes were brown. He wasnt getting anything in the mail but past-due bills, definitely not kilos of cocaine. He did have a trashbag full of cocaine that one weekend like Matt said, and they did smoke around a half ounce, like 14 grams, but he only had it because he had robbed an actual drug dealer at gun point that same night he walked into Matts room pretending he was Scarface.¬†

But I didnt know this yet. In my mind, I was thinking I had just found a reason to hope I would be cooking and smoking coke very soon, probably even finding an opportunity to shoot some powder, and I was already imagining the joyous rush of cocaine I hoped Id be having sometime in the very near future.

Matt and Amy kept insisting I meet Jeff, and I eventually did. The house Matt lived in was a boarders house about a 5 minute walk from the Hyannis Bus Terminal. It had around 6 different bedrooms that were rented by the month, a shared kitchen and a few shared bathrooms. Matts room was on the first floor in the back, and had a seperate door to the outside, which was cool. Jeffs room was upstairs, through the main entrance, and was flanked by a room on each side, one of which was vacant. When I met Jeff, Amy and I went up to his room with him, and we talked and bullshitted while he told me about himself and his connections. He said he had been born in Haiti, that much was obvious, and that his mother had abandoned him in the hospital as a newborn, to go back to the streets of Haiti and her crack addiction. He was quick to point out he was a crack baby. He was adopted by his grandmother, who lived in ATL, and moved there when he was 10. Then at some point his mother also moved to ATL, and he moved in with her. I will never forget him telling me how his mother had ashtrays overflowing with crack stems like an ashtray full of cigarette butts. I could only feel sorrow and empathy for him when he told me that, I knew what that meant. I felt a little pang of guilt for being raised by parents that didnt smoke coke or shoot dope, even if they were divorced and my childhood was traumatic.¬†

Jeff wasnt all bad. He was just a con artist. I eventually figured his whole hustle out, just like I do with anyone I spend any real time with. He would claim, like he did with me that night, that he had never smoked crack, that he only had ever just sniffed coke. I had some coke, and I cooked it in a spoon on his coffee table while he watched me with the focus of a hawk. I could tell he was shocked and impressed when I flicked a yellow boulder out onto the lotto ticket on the table to dry, looking up to smile at him.¬†

‚ÄúThat‚Äôll put some hair on your chewing gum‚Äù I said, in the best Early Cuyler voice I could muster.

‚ÄúDamn that does look pretty good‚Äù Jeff said. ‚ÄúI dont know though, I aint never smoked that shit before, I‚Äôm not sure I should‚Äù

‚ÄúYou absolutely shouldnt‚Äù I said, and I meant it. ‚ÄúYou do at your own peril, trust me my dude. You shouldnt ever take the panties of this bitch. I‚Äôll give you some powder if you wanna sniff. I just wanted to show you I can chef. I dont want to turn you out.‚Äù

‚ÄúFuck it‚Äù Jeff said, grabbing a stem and bringing it his lips. ‚ÄúI want to see what this is all about‚Äù.

So Jeffs hustle was that he pretended he had never smoked crack before. People were always generous with someone smoking coke their first time, he had figured that out and was exploiting it.¬†

I tell you about Jeff for a good reason.¬†

Jeff and I became cool, and he knew I was homeless. He looked out for me on a few occasions, telling me I could sleep in the vacant room next to his. I had to leave by 6am, and it was just an empty room, but it was shangra la compared to being hunched over in some bando too cold and too scarred to sleep for more than a few minutes at a time. I would take my hoodie off, fold it up, lay it on top of my backpack, and kind of lean against it in a half reclined half laid down position. I would wake up and my legs would be numb, my back screaming at me, but when your homeless you come to appreciate things others would claim intolerable. I wasnt comfortable, but I was safe and warm. You also learn what it means to be truly grateful when you are on the streets. Jeff barely knew me, but letting me crash in that room put him at risk because it could end up coming back on him if I was caught, or caught the house on fire, or refused to leave when 6am came. I always made sure to thank him and I never got caught or fucked up his situation.¬†

So anyway, one night, probably about a month after Sean jumped in the Honda and left me to die on the sidewalk that day, Jeff and I were sitting on the front porch his house, me smoking newport reds, him smoking a blunt. It was dark out, probably like 10pm, and we were just bullshitting when all of a sudden, we see a figure appear in the street, walking slowly towards us. As the walking figure got within eyesight, I immediately recognized who it was, someone I hadnt seen for a long time, no matter how much I had looked and asked others where he was.¬†

It was Sean, the same pony tailed greasy sack of shit that had looked me in the eyes promising me relief only to leave me to die in the street.¬†

‚ÄúJeff, stay right here, I gotta go handle something‚Äù I whispered, standing up out of the wooden Adirondack chair.¬†

‚ÄúWhere you going nigga?‚Äù Jeff asked in his strong drawl, half Haitian and half southern.

‚ÄúI gotta go do this thing real quick‚Äù I said, as I walked down off the porch towards Sean.¬†

Sean looked at me coming towards him and immediately I saw terror on his face. I went into my pocket for the boxcutter I had, and I heard him say ‚ÄúOhhhh shiiiiit‚Äù but after that I went black.

I came to, hand covered in blood, standing over Sean writhing around on the pavement, and realized what I had down.¬†

‚ÄúMy face!!! My fucking face!!!‚Äù Sean screamed, clutching at the piece of cheek hanging from his jaw.¬†

‚ÄúShut the fuck up you little bitch or I‚Äôll give the other buck fifty and make it a whole 3 dollars‚Äù I seethed. ‚ÄúYou really thought you wouldnt ever see me again? Your lucky I dont open up your windpipe and let you leak out on GP. Pick your shit up and get the fuck out my face, and dont ever cross my path again or I might finish what I started on you.‚Äù¬†

This wasnt me. I dont know who the person speaking out of my mouth was, but I didnt protest much either. I was due some payback, some actual balancing of the karmic scales. Sean had robbed me of my last $40, and he did it in a way that was cowardly and disgusting. He could have shorted my bag and gotten over on me, but I still would have gotten well and it would have been nothing more than another drug deal. Instead, I later learned that the boys he called who he absconded with that day didnt even HAVE DOPE. They only hustled coke. Sean was NEVER planning to help me, he was going to beat me from the jump.

Sean picked himself up off the ground just as Jeff came off the porch scolding me. ‚ÄúWhat the fuck wrong with you Slim. Now the fucking feds gon be here, you better hope this white boy dont call police. I dont need this kind of heat my nigga, you gotta relax.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúBro this that bitch that beat me when I was on my death bed, remember I told you a while back about it. Fuck all that police shit, he knows better.‚Äù Sean immediately mumbled ‚ÄúIm not gonna call proliceeee‚Äù and the 3 of us all realized at that moment, that Sean's mouth and his speech were fucked up from the laceration reaching from his ear to his lip crease.¬†

‚ÄúJust go, faggot‚Äù I said, as the guilt started creeping in. I never was violent by nature. I abhorred hurting people, to be honest. But I had learned as a young man, sometimes others leave you no choice. Not acting would be like saying ‚Äúits ok to hurt me‚Äù. So I did what the fuck needed to be done. I‚Äôd push it down and away, like so much of what I had experienced, and deal with it later.

I never saw Sean again. Not that he wasnt still out and around. People always told me when they saw him. No, he was making it his job to avoid me at any cost. And he disappeared into the fog of my past, eventually becoming a forgotten memory.

Also the withdrawal is absolutely hell even with 24 mg of bupe.

 Honestly its not that gross to drink your own clear urine. Doesnt even have a taste really. Id be willing to drink it if it gave a free high. Someone posted about extracting it also.

A twin mattress faced a tiny TV that had to be from the early 1990‚Äôs. The bed sheets were mismatched and had human hair on them. The blanket was filthy. I slept in my clothes on the top of the bed.

It was late March, and it had snowed again the night before. I woke up shivering, chilled to the bone, incapable of getting my body temperature to rise. There was no heat in the room, no way to warm up. I attempted to take a hot shower as a last resort but the shower didn‚Äôt work. 
The motel room had been paid for by a clinic I had been getting my suboxone from. I had called my counselor/doctor there the day I became homeless and had told him what happened. He had put me in touch with another counselor there and she had gotten me the room for 3 nights. Checkout was in 4 hours.

I decided it made no sense to sit in the room til 10:30am. I was homeless and about to be on the street in the winter, 6 inches of snow on the ground, 35 degrees in the day, 25 and sometimes 10 at night. My fate had been decided. I was facing a world I had never been in, and I was truly afraid. 

Ok so I haven‚Äôt told you everything yet. Being homeless was already terrifying and dangerous, but I also had another problem, a major one. I was out of suboxone, had $40 to my name, and I was beginning to get really sick. Being dope sick in the warmth and safety of your own home was intolerable, so the prospect of being dope sick on the street in freezing cold weather with nowhere to go was about the closest thing to hell on earth I could imagine. So I decided to leave the motel room and get to the block. Maybe I could find someone with dope for sale. I had $40 which would get me at least enough heroin to keep me well for the day into the night, if I was smart about how much I did. I just had to find someone to buy from. 
I walked out of the motel room wearing the only clothes I had: a grey winter beanie on my head, a grey hoodie (hood up), a pair of dark blue jeans, my black tactical backpack, and a pair of camouflage air max. 

I trekked through the snow across the street and headed down to the bus station where almost always a few street kids or homeless drunks could be found. I‚Äôd driven by them a million times, now I was one of them. I wondered if they would accept me or if I would be shunned. I wondered if I‚Äôd end up dead in some bando with a blade buried in my ear, pockets pulled out of my jeans like rabbit ears. I wondered about my future. 

Around 8am I saw Amy, and she immediately knew what kind of shape I was in:

‚ÄúYou look like shit bro. Do you need a sub?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, fuck subs, I need dope.‚Äù I said, stubbornly.

‚ÄúBabe just take a sub - you will feel better and not waste your money‚Äù she countered, and she was right. 

‚ÄúNah I want to get dope sis. It gotta be dope. I‚Äôm fucking homeless out here in March. I stayed clean for 2 months for nothing. I‚Äôm not gonna be on the street and not use.
I need to get on and leave the disaster that has become my life behind for a while.‚Äù

‚ÄúOk hun I understand but if you decide you want a sub just tell me. But I‚Äôm sure we can find you something, how much do you have?‚Äù

‚Äú$40, and I want at least a .4‚Äù 

‚ÄúYea ok lets go over to the Jamaican store and see who we bump into‚Äù

Amy and I had met a few days before, and she had taken on the role of defacto street Mom to me. When she introduced me to other people on the street, she would say:

‚ÄúAnd this is my brother Slim. Oh you didn‚Äôt know I had a brother? Yup, he just got out of prison.‚Äù

I had watched her closely as she had taken me under her wing me in the previous 3 days. I had the motel room those first 3 nights. Now I was truly homeless. At first I suspected she was just trying to set me up for a quick lick, like trying to see if I was worth anything, if I had anything she wanted, etc. But she had been nothing but genuine and compassionate to me, so I was starting to trust her.
As we walked to the Jamaican store, Amy asked everyone we bumped into if they knew where we could find some dope. It made no sense really. Any other day there were 50 people around with heroin for sale. I ended up needing it the one morning of the month that nobody had anything. Then just as we arrived at the store, we bumped into Sean.
I had seen Sean a few times before, and he always had the same clothes on: Black sweat pants, raggedy white new balance sneakers, a black Boston College sweatshirt and his slick black hair, pulled into a pony tail. I had actually met him once when I had been staying at the hotel with the jacuzzis in the rooms, partying with a couple girls. I was walking through the hotel hallways looking for an ice machine and I came across him, down in the back hallway of the hotels bowels. I spoke to him briefly, later realizing he was basically squatting down there, probably because he had no where else to go.
Amy flagged Sean down and told him what the situation was. 

‚ÄúYeah I can get that for you right now, what did you need?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúLook man, Im going to make this simple for you. I don‚Äôt let my bread walk. So it‚Äôs like this: you can bring your people to me and I transact with them, or you can put your money up for it and then sell it to me. But you ain‚Äôt taking my cash and dipping, leaving me to wait for you to come back.‚Äù

‚ÄúBro I totally understand, I absolutely get it‚Äù.

‚ÄúMan I‚Äôm not trying to be a dick, it‚Äôs just I am sick as fuck, I‚Äôm getting worse, and this is the last $40 I got so I have to get straight or I‚Äôm gonna be fucked‚Äù

He looked me straight in my eyes and said ‚Äúlisten man, I‚Äôve been there. I‚Äôve been sick like you are, I‚Äôm not going to do that to you. I know how it feels to be that sick, I couldn‚Äôt do that to you‚Äù
 
‚ÄúOk so how do we do this?‚Äù I asked him.

Before he could answer, Amy jumped in front of him and said ‚ÄúSean don‚Äôt fuck around. This is my brother. If you do any dirty shit I swear to god I will hunt you down and I will cut you.‚Äù 

Sean paused and looked at Amy for a moment, and then blurted out ‚ÄúAmy I know you are crazy I‚Äôm not stupid ok, believe me I know.‚Äù

At this point I was starting to think Sean would play fair. I told him I would break off a piece of dope for him if my package was correct, and I planned to do just that. Being stingy in the street, homeless or not, is ill advised. Felony favors aren‚Äôt free. 
Sean made a phone call, and then proceeded to explain what was going to happen.

‚ÄúOk so my dude is on the way here. When he pulls up I will go to his car with your cash and grab it from him through his window, then walk right back to you. I‚Äôll never leave your sight.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo bro, I told you, my money doesn‚Äôt walk.‚Äù At that same moment I could feel the withdrawal symptoms beginning to go into overdrive. I had maybe 30 minutes before I would be incapable of controlling my bowels anymore, and once I took that first shit, what I call ‚Äúbreaking the seal‚Äù, I would be vacating my bowels for the next 4 hours, eventually squirting diarrhea to the point that my asshole would burn from passing so much shit and acidic stomach bile. I was beginning to panic on the inside, knowing that if this thing I was trying to do with Sean didn‚Äôt work out I was gonna be in real trouble. It was fucking freezing out, but I was soaked in cold sweat. My nose was pouring clear snot. My eyes were running, my muscles starting to burn and ache. 

Sean made another call, and then looked at me and said ‚Äúyo my dude don‚Äôt want to meet new people so it‚Äôs either I take your money to him or it can‚Äôt happen‚Äù. I looked at Amy, and she said ‚ÄúI think you can trust him. If he does anything, he knows I‚Äôm gonna cut him from ear to ear.‚Äù 
Now normally, in this situation, I always stood my ground. I refuse to let people take my money and buy for me; if I can‚Äôt handle the business then we can‚Äôt do business. But I was desperate. He seemed sincere. Amy made me feel like Sean understood the dire repercussions he would face if he took off with my cash. So against my better judgement I agreed to let Sean walk to the car with my last $40. 
When the car pulled up, it drove past us on the sidewalk and stopped about 10 yards away. I handed Sean the 2 twenty dollar bills from my pocket and watched him as he walked to the car. 
He immediately opened the rear door behind the driver. Ok, I thought, he‚Äôs gonna get in to transact. Maybe dudes window was up. 
He pulled the car door closed and the next thing I heard was him saying ‚ÄúYo GO GO GO!!!‚Äù And with that I watched my money drive away in a late model teal Honda Accord, two Dominican kids from providence in front, Sean in back, turned around looking at me to see if I was going to try to chase.
I lifted my hand and made a pistol with my fingers, pointed it at him, and made the ‚ÄúBang‚Äù motion. 
The car turned fast and hard around the corner and was gone.

So I made a purchase from a reputable online vendor recently. I usually purchase Afghan #4 but after trying some really good street tar I decided I wanted to find an online tar vendor. I found one who advertises their product as gun powder but everyone in reviews and other places mentioned it is actually tar, though a very good quality tar. 

When I received package this stuff was in a bag but looked super dry almost crusty brown looking, texture of wood, matte finish. When I took it out of the bag, it immediately started soaking up humidity from the air and turned into the the blackest tar I‚Äôve seen yet. Not super sticky but u could tell it was tar as before it looked weird. Now the thing that is tripping me out is the smell. It smells completely different than the vinegar smell I know and love from street tar. I do not shoot up, I usually do monkey water in a spray bottle or turn to cheese. But this stuff smells so bad/unique that I wonder if this is cut with something or maybe it has something added to it to turn into that wood consistency for easy shipping or to pass off as gun powder? Figured if anyone knew what was up it would be you guys. I tried some last night, only 0.02 to test it out as it is supposed to be really strong but I didn‚Äôt feel much just fell asleep. I would really appreciate the help. Thanks guys and gals. ",1534255668.0

This feels wrong, is it true? 

I was under the impression that it was only to be used in the event of a legitimate overdose. 

I would never waste narcan and I certainly don't have any interest in undoing the effects of my oxy or morphine but hypothetically what would happen if someone was decently high (but not OD'ing) and took the naloxone spray? Would it immediately undo the high? Would there be any other side effects?

(I need you all to know that I‚Äôm not an opiate user or addict.  Like the rest of us, though, my drug of choice has always been ‚Äúmore‚Äù.)  I‚Äôve been saddled with treatment-resistant clinical depression for about 20 years now, and this last week has been quite bad; I‚Äôve basically been holed up in my room for the majority of the time.  The reading & identifying have helped me to stay (relatively) sane, and so I want to thank all of you for all that you say & share.  (I‚Äôm also a drunk & drug addict in recovery, thank my maker.)

Often, when I‚Äôm quite depressed, I struggle to put cogent thoughts together, and can have difficulty writing well, which is extraordinarily frustrating for me.  That said, I‚Äôll do my best here.

It might be tempting for some to think that I‚Äôm treating my pain by marveling at the misery of others, but I am truly not a sadist, nor do I ever take any joy in the sorrow of another soul.  It would be more accurate to say that I find it comforting to be among my kind.   Drunks, junkies, stoners, freaks, those with one sort of mental illness or another...  it‚Äôs been my experience that we all have lived a certain special type of agony that cannot be adequately explained on the written page, or by the spoken word.  (We‚Äôve long since stopped trying to explain this kind of thing to the layman.)

As I read the various posts & stories, I see myself in each of them.  From the seeming-and-fleeting happiness in the early years of my using, to the untold hell of an addicted life, to the yearning for recovery while achieving none, to finally getting & living clean.   I‚Äôm reading it all from each of you, and it‚Äôs all me too.

It seems that my depression is a demon which may have reeked more pain & destruction on my life than any other, over the years.  This is the one demon from which I simply have not been able to achieve significant, sustained recovery.  I do honestly wonder if I ever will.  On nights like tonight, I do a lot of doubting.

Finally, two years ago, I was sponsoring a new kid in the deal who was about 90 days clean.  Rob, a recovering heroin addict.  I loved that kid.  He was me when I got sober.   He was just like me.   We worked together for weeks.  And then one single day passed without him calling me, as he always did. The next day, I got the call.  Yeah, that one.  Done.  One shot.  Over.   I was absolutely devastated.

I don‚Äôt want that to be me today, and I don‚Äôt want it to be you either.  But it‚Äôs gonna be somebody.  That‚Äôs just the fucked up reality of this thing.  Because of being able to read what you say, I‚Äôm just a little better tonight than I would otherwise have been, and I thank you all for that most sincerely.  Similarly, all of you continue to help, protect, encourage & save each other by saying & sharing all that you do.

I may not necessarily have a lot to offer, but I feel strongly compelled to express my thanks.

My diagnosis is post laminectomy syndrome with arachnoiditis and bilateral radiopathy. Conservative methods like epidurals, PT, spinal cord stim, non-opioid pain killers do not work to control my pain.  Doctor after doctor is dropping their opioid patients, finding them too big a risk to their license.  The last doctor to discharge me admitted opioids were appropriate for me (I was in compliance, no increases in dose, no alternative treatments, etc) but fears all the crackdowns happening.

I am about to try and find a new pain doc, just want to figure out some of the puzzling behavior of my last doctor and his PA.  The pain doc was pressuring me to get epidurals and other procedures already demonstrated and fully documented to make my condition worse (all the epidurals caused arachnoiditis.)  He also seemed angry I wouldn‚Äôt pay $9K out of pocket for a procedure because my insurance won‚Äôt cover it (considered experimental.)  The procedure offered little relief in the past anyway, barely above what might be the placebo effect (RFA.)  His PA was constantly pressuring me to report I was in less pain than I actually was.  If I didn‚Äôt cave to their pressures, they made indications they would discharge me.  I was eventually discharged when I asked my doctor to fill out forms to activate my temporary disability insurance.  

As I was discharged while in compliance, I am not sure what to tell the next pain management doc.  I need this stuff to live, without I am in so much pain I am bed-ridden and constantly contemplating suicide- not in a depressed way, just in a escaping misery kind of way.  I am by no means an addict, I am a responsible father and husband with good ties to the community.  While other opioids do make me high, the hydrocodone I am on does not impair me (or give me feeling of euphoria) even at the high dose i‚Äôm on (80 mg total a day.)

Is anyone out there that can provide me with insights into pain doctor‚Äôs minds.  Why are they pressuring me in ways that are counter to my care?  How should I respond so that I can attain a high standard of care for my condition?

I wish I didn‚Äôt need opioids to live.  Life had become so hard since the new regulations, life has been absolute hell.  Before anyone asks, I have an odd brain chemistry.  Weed makes me psychotic, so does ultram (makes me have violent and suicidal impulses.)  Not willing to take illegal drugs.

But I heard from my friend today that another friend of mine had snorted 0.5g heroin yesterday and now he doesn't answer his phone or anything? Isn't this a very high dose? I believe my friend has a moderate opiate tolerance but definitely NOT a high one. 

He only started expirmenting with opiates a few months ago and mostly Oxycontin and codeine and started using heroin only occasionally in the beginning of the summer I think and I have no idea what dosages he's used too.

I have taken Tramadol approximately i dont know, 25 times in the past 6 months due to extreme pain
My dose is very low
I try splitting the 50mg capsules in half sometimes


ANYWAYS!

What ive noticed with Tramadol is that sometimes it works extremely extremely well like i had just unlocked the key to enlightenment,

And sometimes it does not.

I am not opiate naive,

I take it before, or after my Suboxone

Taking it after produces a more sedating effect


ON THE GOOD DAYS THAT TRAMADOL WORKED,
It was like clear-headed pain killing focus

But that was only a couple of times

I am now foregoing the Tramadol.

Buprenorphine relieves my pain but it is not controlling it to the degree that i need . I have not tried re-doseing bupe as i do not know if it would have any effect taking more hours later . 

Buprenorphine though hasn't produced any side effects
it acts as a typical opiate , just no pain killing effects, which fucking sucks

I am taking a boatload of NSAIDs alternating between diclofenac/naproxen and motrin in conjunction with tylenol and a few other things and its wearing thin on me.

I have some type of facial pain disorder which also has created a TMJ (jaw/ears/etc) disorder. some type of neuralgia . i have to get more MRIs.

So the doc gave me 15 tramadol, i had a few at home anyways,and yea, shit, i lost track

Anyways Tramadol has some horrendous side effects including memory loss, tremors, loss of coordination and focus, inability to focus, fuck me in the ass


It did help with upper-scalp migraines . 

so what do i ask for next?

the doctor knows i take suboxone, and has spoken with my suboxone doctor, which is how i got the trams

I don't want to come off as a drug seeker even though im seeking drugs to cure my goddamn pain lol

I would appreciate any input on how to discuss with my doctor to switch to ANYTHING (literally anything) even if its abuse proof: i.e. abuse proof oxy, abuse proof hydrocodone, etc.",1534163547.0

I actually first tried it because of this girl I had a huge crush on was a pot head. Interesting enough 18 years later that same  Girl is laying in bed Next to me sleeping as I write this. 

It‚Äôs Been a rough road to get where we are, and I only see things getting harder for us both. Now if your thinking this is some great love story about how drugs brought us together you would be wrong. Drugs have done nothing but tear the two of us apart time and time again. Some how though we always end up back with each other. This on/off again relationship took a major turn 10 years ago when she Told me that she had begun using Heroin. At the time I was still a pot head and completely opposed to the idea of using anything harder. 

At the time she had come to me, wanting to stop, at least that is what she said and we gave it a go, but with time i realized that i didn‚Äôt trust her, and therefore I didn‚Äôt love her.  We split up this time for about 3 years, until i found out she had been arrested for forging checks. I thought at the time maybe this would be her chance to stop so i decided to start corresponding with her until she got out of jail and after we started living forward again. Yet still there was trust issues, and eventually we again broke it. 

Over the years we have not spoken I rarely seen her around the small town we live in, when i did it was the only way i knew she was alive, at one point i was even checking the obituaries every morning with my breath held convinced that today would be the day I would find her name . 

about Three years ago I found out that after i last split up she had become homeless, and was eventually taken in off the streets by some one who was also abusing Heroin and other drugs, we ran in to each other and some angry words where exchanged and it ended with me having a mental breakdown. See she has a funny way of making everyone around her think they are crazy especially me. She actually had me doubting myself that I was just paranoid and that she was clean all this time.  eventually i would find out the truth though. 

This last April I finally did see her Name on the front page of the newspaper only not in the obituaries, but the front page story with the headline Three arrested for Prostitution. Wow my heart broke instantly i‚Äôve known this woman she was 16. About a month later When she got out she emailed me, two weeks went by before i actually seen the email,  it said she was sober and determined to stay that way. So with out a second thought i responded. 

Came to find out what had happened, and that she was once again homeless, In all honesty I believed her when she told me she wasn‚Äôt using, but i still didn‚Äôt trust her. One other issue we have had over the years is my temper and nothing brings that out more then some one lying to me. several things happened over the next month to make me question her honesty about being clean. Then she had a bad day and came to me telling me that she wanted to shoot again, and I made the biggest mistake of my life. 

I told her if you do it, I do it and so we did. A week later she moved in with me and not a single night has passed that we haven‚Äôt shot Heroin.

I don‚Äôt want too, yet I feel like i have made a deal with the devil and there is no getting out of it now, I only hope at some point she is ready to stop, and that i still have the strength to do so my self.  I love her with all my heart and if need be I will dive in to hell to drag her out, I just hope we can both make it back.",1534140934.0

96vq3y,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/96vq3y/my_sphincter_quivered/,6,https://redd.it/96vq3y,ASavageLost,My sphincter quivered.,"Over by the graveyards I found a crackhead lady who said she could help me get some heroin for 14 bucks. We pulled into the Chevron. She jumped out to see if she could get me some brown for the 14 bucks. The guys in the car had some but they wanted $40. She told me to drive to a few other places and jumped out to check at different houses. I swerved to one last house, and while she was in the house my guts shook. My sphincter quivered. An untied leather boot turned itself around inside of me and tried to push itself through my throat before I puked up bile and red cough syrup all over the interior of my mother‚Äôs Mercedes Benz. I opened the door and slid out of the vehicle into the street to pull down my pants. An aerosol of liquid sprayed the pavement and the backs of my shoes. A trickle ran down my legs, and before the sun came up my vomit gushed onto the pavement in the middle of the ghetto. This went on for a few minutes before I gave up on the woman coming back and left. She could have the 14 bucks.

I continued to vomit on myself and let my bowels go on the drive home. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to die. I‚Äôm going to die,‚Äù I repeated to myself between retching and the expulsion of bile from my mouth. Warm liquid spread across the seat of my pants.

My father met me at the front door. He knew I had stolen the car and some money, but most of all he knew I was going to die from this sickness if I didn‚Äôt get to the hospital. My mother drove, and my father sat with me in the back seat. They wheeled me to the ER, where I talked the doctor into giving me some water. My dad told her not to give me any, and I puked it up like he said I would. Soon I was on the gurney in convulsions, in and out of consciousness.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm about to sh\*t!‚Äù I managed to gurgle to my dad and the orderly through the vomit. The orderly and my dad hooked the back of my knees with their arms and pulled me up to slide the bedpan under me.

A doctor came in and belittled me for letting them put me on so much medicine in Oregon. I would have cursed him out, but it was too hard to talk and puke and convulse at the same time.

Went to the bar with all of my coworkers and my main boss. Lost at beer pong (horribly), fell out of a chair at the bar and broke stuff but didn't get kicked out. Fell asleep for like 20 minutes then woke up and chugged the half a pitcher I had. Got hit by a car (our Uber driver) woke my boss up at 4 am because I was sleep walking, etc.

So, I'm still alive, wild as ever, hoping court goes well, and some fucking how still have a job. But idk if I'm getting invited next time we do a ""get drunk with everyone from work"" thing.

Bonus points for the Uber driver that hit me being my dental hygienist's mom and me repeatedly telling her how hot her daughter was before she hit me with a car... I have a dentist appointment in like a week so that should be fun.

Ya ya you shouldn't push in while tied but most do. Sometimes I hear a gurgling and feel the same when I don't get it off before I start pushing in.  I never use to. There's no reaction or pain. No blowing of veins. It happens on certain veins on both arms. I actually now know I hit when it happens. It's like its the shot bouncing off the tie or slowing down. It still goes through when tied.

I never could get through to users who thought their tie stopped all the shot so when they took it off they'd get it all at once....you'd have to tie off so tight you'd amputate to stop it from getting through.

I'm just wondering if anyone notices this. Smaller veins too. My big were fucked into komodo dragon scales long ago. Good thing tho? I can't hit it so the blood pumps through there like a champ.

After two weeks of the symptoms getting worse I stopped taking the subs for two days and then talked to my doctor. Got an ekg that showed no issues and switched to subutex. Only tried those for two days and immediately felt ten times worse. Haven't taken any more bupe and the symptoms have slowly gotten better with each passing day. 

What's the deal? Everyone I know tolerates bupe with basically no major issues. I have tried just about every opiate/opiod available in the states and have never had any adverse effects. Sure some things I didn't enjoy like tramadol but never anything really bad.

Typically a lurker/reader of this sub, and I drew inspiration from the cold cop stories. I've tried CL, Whisper and Tinder with 0 success which surprised me because I live in a fairly large urban city and less than 2 hours away from a well-known city with bountiful open markets. I searched the typical keywords on CL with no success, posted about 2 Whispers with no response and made a Tinder profile but a few swipes in and I knew it wouldn't be fruitful. I remember seeing a post about POF, so I decided to try it. BINGO.

This is my second attempt at cold copping, and it finally paid off. How I did it: I found a picture of myself that didn't show any identifiers like tattoos and didn't really show all of my face. I showed enough of myself where someone would be on the fence if I was catfish or not, but interested enough to message me. In order to weed out any people actually looking for love (lol), my tagline or the text that appeared next to my picture said ""looking for a plug only."" Plug is a more popular term in the black community where I live than connect (I'm a black female btw).

Next, weeding out messages. I wait for them to message me. I only respond to messages that start with ""what are you looking for,"" ""what kind of plug,"" ""what do you need"" or anything along those lines. I don't respond if they simply say ""hey beautiful"" or give me a random compliment because I don't want to give the impression that I'm actually interested in dating. I'm on a mission! Lol.

Maybe every 3 out of 10 messages ask me what I'm looking for. When I say that I'm looking for percs (I really mean just good ole oxy by its lonesome, but again - slang), maybe 1 of those 3 people follows up with ""how many"" ""what kind"" etc. I've made plans to meet up with a total of 3 or 4 people total (including both cold cop attempts) and all of them fell through because the person stopped responding after setting up a (public) place to meet and exchanging numbers. Disappointing but part of the game.

FINALLY, I found a person that followed through! He only had 15s, and he was selling them at $1 per mg. I've gotten offers for $8 per 15mg and $20 per 30mg before, but as I said, none of those offers came through. But I'm desperate at the moment since I haven't been high in a week or two, and I know that $1 per mg isn't abnormal. So I ask if he could do 7 for $100, but he only had 4 left. (It takes about ~40mg to get me high). The available quantity was disappointing but I didnt care. So I told him I'll buy all 4, for the normal $1 per mg price.

4 hours later he messages me and tells me he's mobile and meet him in 15. I met him by a random intersection of streets in the hood. He came to my window and waited. I flashed a smile and opened my palm to signify I wanted to see the pills before I gave him the money. They looked legit so I handed him the cash. He asked me if I smoked because he wanted to smoke me out, but I declined because my only drug vice is popping pills. I really don't fuck with weed because it gives me anxiety and alcohol gives me migraines. He tried asking me out but I told him I had to go, so he told me to keep in contact, then we parted ways and now I'm high. A love story. the end.

If you're curious about any other aspect of my cold cop, just ask. This is my first reddit post so sorry if I included too many unnecessary details lol.",1534116320.0

Daily I work towards small victories in this sober lifestyle. Living in a 3/4 house, I get randomly drug tested as part of their policy of residency. I don‚Äôt even smoke weed, which legally I can obtain a medical card, but under a federal VA rule I cannot smoke.


Small victories everyday. I bust my ass sweating buckets doing dirty manual labor all day, and without drugs I find I need to set up small things to look forward to. Instant gratification is something as addicts we altered in our brains. Dopamine in our brains is lacking without drugs, and drugs ruled over food, sleep, safety, and relationships. Heroin puts us in an animal state where dope is number one. 

I find what I have to do to live a semi fulfilling life is to set up small victories for gratification purposes. All day I‚Äôm working, I try to glorify taking a nice shower to clean up, and thinking about what movie or show I want to watch to try to have something to look forward to. Even if it means not smoking all day to get back and enjoy a cigarette after a hard days work, that small victory helps me with the monotony of life.

I‚Äôm sure normal people get more fulfillment from things, and are able to think outside that box and socialize and achieve things higher up in the hierarchy of needs as per Maslows triangle. But as addicts, we have to live a different lifestyle, and many of us turn to drugs because we see the ceiling of society and just say fuck that. Working every single day to pay out all your income to bills and rent is not a life we want. We opened Pandora‚Äôs box and felt the euphoria of heroin and now know there is another, easier way to live. But in the end, that life leads to misery. 

I‚Äôm ranting, just wanted to say, life is boring and living sober we see what‚Äôs really to be of our lives. It‚Äôs hard to live sober after use, but small victories and achievable goals help get through the day. I just hope I can stay the course. I‚Äôm still in that addict mindset of living day to day, and I don‚Äôt like it.

When that ended, it started a six year run almost with heroin. During my senior year of university I got arrested for sales and distribution and got 18 months while being kicked out of school. California good time made that nine months and it was the only time in those past six years that I was clean. 

I got out about two years ago and for all intents and purposes, I got my life back together if you ask anyone that knows. I went back to school and now I'm on the other side of the country in Ohio but I never stopped using. I just used less. When I finally transferred back from community college to where I am now, that was always my ""expiration date"". Once I get there, I'll stop. Once I'm back to where I was before everything went to shit. The change in scenery would help I always reasoned and since leaving a few weeks ago, I've been clean for the first time in seven years. But it's miserable.

Logically, I recognize that at one point I must have been normal but now it's all so dreadfully boring. I am going through the motions because it's expected of me but I am miserable and unhappy. I haven't been physically sick in a couple weeks. I'm sleeping again. But I'm in a new city and all I do is wake up and watch tv and have trouble getting out of bed. Everyone keeps congratulating me and I try to be happy and tell them thank you but I want to puke from the banality and nonsense of it all. 

I'm not sure I even want to be sober but I know I'm suppose to be. I did a year of out patient meetings before leaving to come here (despite the fact that I used through it all) and it wasn't for me. I met good people but couldn't stand the fakeness of it all. Hell, I got high with half the people I met there. I kept trying to say I was going to quit the week before I moved but I used until the night before I left for my now second trip university, definitely older this time but obviously not wiser. My first seven days here were miserable. The first night I finally slept, I was genuinely ecstatic. I honestly woke up positively thinking, more than just thinking I could do it, but that I wanted to do it. I went for an appointment at the school and got outside for the first time and then a day or two later the feelings I am describing now started to kick in.

School starts August 21st. The idea of sitting through engineering and mathematics or of leaving and doing anything just seems like something I'm not interested in. But I'm not interested in anything. I was watching a powerful documentary called Amy on Netflix that followed the life of Amy Winehouse from childhood to death through home videos and after she got clean and won the grammys and everyone around her was congratulating her, she told her best friend that this was all so fucking boring without drugs. She died a little bit later. That's the best way to describe how I feel. Not the dying. I'm not suicidal. But life is fucking boring and yet I know this is normal. At one point I was happy with normal. 

I know enough to know that my brain is fucked, chemically, and in all likelihood just isn't producing enough chemicals to balance me out because it was use to being flooded all the time by the heroin. But knowing something logically doesn't help deal with it and I don't know where to go from here. Whether I should say fuck expectations and try to find something here or if I can deal with this. When I was physically ill, it's strange but I was determined. ""Fuck you sickness. I'm stronger than you."" Now not so much,  especially because there seems to be no logical conclusion. I've read everything from this lasting thirty days for some to literally never ending for others. 

At a time I should be happy and everyone around me is happy, I am miserable.",1534097562.0

since then ive been taking a few scoops of kratom at night, and waking up in goosebumps that are taken care of with a single 2mg immodium, for the rest of the day

i recently noticed that when i took a small dose of kratom (1-3g of green malay, usually i have like 6g of red but ran out), ill get that nice warm glow for 1-6 hrs depending on the dose, but then when it wears off i get goosebumps straight away! (with low doses of the green strain anyways, with red ones and in a decent dose-- im good for like 12 hrs)

i took some loperamide after (2mg), and then 4mg more cos i had trouble sleeping when my kratom ran out-- goosebumps vanish, but then after a single 1g dose of kratom (scraped the bag lmao), they returned 1h after the dose wore off!

ended up taking 16mg of loperamide yesterday, since it kept getting knocked off my receptors with the miniscule doses of kratom i was taking at seperate intervals-- when usually just 2mg does the trick for the whole day

I sometimes enjoy prepping a nice moderate speedball and walking my dog to the local park to find a nice quiet spot to shoot before the walk home. Well, tonight as I was prepping the hit I happened to notice my little ziploc baggy (the 1"" x 1"" size) was closed but sitting in a small puddle of condensation from where my water bottle sat just earlier. I immediately snatched it up and looked through the non-graphic/clear side to see that, while 99% of it was dry, there was a bit of water that had found tiny holes in the crevasses of the bags edges and some had begun to dissolve into mush. I dumped the  bag onto a small plastic card, and eventually got the dry coke into a new bag while a bit of this mush was left behind stuck to the card. ""Waste not, want not"" I told myself as I scraped this remainder into my mixer, added a bit of tar, and (this was where I fucked up) decided to add just a liiiitle more coke, two very small pebbles...

What you have to understand at this point is that, when crystalline solids dissolve into a solvent, their physical volume begins to mean nothing.. I can dissolve a gram of blow and a milligram of blow in the same amount of water and give you two syringes. One will likely kill you, the other likely wont have any effect. So while I assumed that this small pittance of wet coke deserved some additional company (more coke), it could have in fact already been perhaps 4 or 5 times my normal dose. I didnt watch it begin to dissolve and didnt note the weight of my coke before and after it was removed to see how much was actually there.

So I walk to the park, crouch down to 'tie my shoe,' tie off, hit on my first poke (which is quite an achievement when you've been slamming tar multiple times a day for a year),  and slowly push the whole lot in. I normally push half and wait a few moments to see how I feel before doing the rest, but I was pushing slow enough to avoid slipping out of the vein that when I got to the halfway point and didnt feel that overwhelmed  I just decided to inject the rest (this was my second mistake).

I knew I was in for it when I immediately felt a new, strong pressure in my lower abdomen. Then I heard the squealing laughter of  children playing even though I looked around and saw no children.. I felt pressure build up in my right eadrum like when you're descending in an airplane. Everything was fuzzy. The words and images on my phone waved, pulsated, and the white background on the Google homepage looked like static on an old TV with no channel dialed in.. the ringing was insane. Every time i shifted my gaze I would see a new hallucination in my peripheral vision. A few times I would actually see my hallucination front and center and it would relate to my surroundings, but then would disappear after a few moments; like a little girl chasing after my dog, or a gardner picking weeds by the fence. I actually began to worry though once i started getting black spots in my vision like when you stand up too fast or are about to pass out. I sat down in the grass and began to evaluate my symptoms and assess for signs of stroke or heart attack. I forgot to bring my little blood pressure cuff, that would have been good to see,  I would have probably measured over 170/100 really. Ive never had such a strong rush ever and Ive measured higher.. I had no trouble reading, talking, moving. No weakness or tingling, nothing. So I got up and we started walking home.

The effects lingered for a couple hours. I'd see people disappearing around corners in the edges of my vision and occasionally hear muffled voices outside even though nobody was around. The small print on my phone would sometimes wiggle or disappear for a second, and random objects sitting on the table would move to different places and back. I honestly believe had I added a little bit more coke that I would have stroked out. Thanks for reading! And learn from my mistakes! Be safe!

I cant go there again so I need to do that at home. I need a strong benzo to make the wds as comfortable as it can be. I also have to work while I am in wds. I dont know how long my dope will last but in the best case it will last untill the weekend is there. I thought about buying: Diazepam 10mg x10 for the end of the wds, Zolpidem for sleeping, Xanax for the start of the wds, bromazepam also for the start. What else can you recommend? I will also get a few sandoz oxy 80mg to taper down. And maybe some tramadol. Which opioids do you recommend to taper down also? Should I get some lyrica too? Thanks in advance. ",1534062812.0

Thats not bad at all, its cheap enough and at low doses like that you don't have to worry about seizures etc. Its hard to describe but it kind of mixes well with ""real"" opiates heh.

There were over 100 pills in the bottle and I went through them all within 12 days. 

My opiate of choice is oxycodone and I usually do 30mg to get me feeling right. Since vicodin is weaker, I'd have to take ~45mg to feel the same as I would with oxy. Since the vics were only 5mg each, I had to pop 9 of those suckers. 

I was too lazy to do a CWE most of the time so I'd just swallow the 9 pills whole. This worked, and it gave me a decent buzz, but it was always accompanied with a nasty headache. I could never understand why that happened until one day I figured out it must be the fucking 3000mg of APAP I took. 

After that I started doing CWE more often, but whenever I did the high felt weaker. It turns out I wasn't leaving the solution in the fridge long enough for the APAP to settle out. After I perfected my method, I started getting waaaaaay better results; a good mellow high with no headache. It's such a damn shame I didn't figure this out earlier. I must have wasted at least 80 of the pills before I got the CWE method right. 

Anyways, I scored some more today after weeks of being dry and I'm feeling content as the sweet Vicodin begins to run through my veins :)",1534049219.0

All but two had been broken or gotten wet with all the food and vomit in the fight.,"Now, it may seem hard to believe that I would have been able to hide my whole body under the pillows on the bed, but remember, everything in the apartment was over sized, like it all belonged to a giant. There were even bigger throw pillows besides. When the owner of the place returned to his room, I could see the giant from under them. He wore a tan colored trench coat which he stripped off as soon as he entered the bedroom and sat with his back to me. He watched TV. There seemed to be no neck. Fuzzy strands of hair stuck out from the cratered back of his skull. The man wore a gown of his own flesh, which hung in ugly folds of white skin, and an even worse smell seemed to emanate from whatever strange bacterial cultures I imagined to be growing under those flaps of fat. The white comforter seemed visibly soiled anywhere his naked skin touched it. *This is what I get.* I thought. *This is what I get for doing meth with Chandra and letting Rufus talk me into running into some strange, stinky room.* It also occurred to me that most people wouldn't ever find themselves in a situation like this just because they went to an office party.  No.  This kind of ridiculousness was unique to life with Rufus.

He pulled a box from under the bed and produced two plastic dolls. The TV played in front of him. His silhouette played with the figurines. It was as unsettling and strange an event as I have ever witnessed in my life. The giant man began to speak for the figurines. One had a cockney accent and the other spoke with the voice of a girl in high school. There was conversation about the things they were wearing and plans for later. It was just the kind of thing you‚Äôd expect to see a child doing privately in their playroom, but it was this middle aged colossal cretin.

I would have laughed, but he passed gas, which was so revolting that I immediately began to gag. My body went limp. It was like this time I got food poisoning from this box of chow Mein an old lady gave me only this was worse. And whatever ability the gargantuan man had to articulate imaginary conversations between his Ken and Barbie dolls seemed to be lost as he pulled back the pillows to find me spewing vomit the consistency of creamy oatmeal onto the floor. He let out an angry bellow. He shouted wet and gargled words I couldn‚Äôt understand. He grabbed my hair. My body came up off the mattress like he was picking up a piece of clothing.

I tried to fight. I was too weak though and too sick. The smell of his fart had started me gagging and the smells in the rest of the apartment were now causing an involuntary retching which they hadn‚Äôt before. We ended up in the kitchen. He smashed the cabinet doors with my head. At some point he threw me on the ground, opened the refrigerator door and toppled it over onto me. Jars of jelly and old cardboard containers of rotten take out fell on me. Then, he picked me up by the neck. Just one of his hands held me up against the wall slowly choking me to death, but he let out an angry shout like some mythological creature who lived under a bridge. His breath led to more puke. It poured out of my nose. I swallowed some of it and struggled to breathe.

It‚Äôs funny the things you think about when your life‚Äôs being taken from you. There I was dying slowly as this man choked me to death. The place smelled terrible. I was pretty sure that I‚Äôd crapped my pants a little bit. It was an embarrassing scenario and an even more embarrassing way to die, but my mind kept telling me that there was honey spilled down my back and in my hair. I don‚Äôt think I ever told you that about me, but sticky things, like jelly or syrup or honey on my skin, drive me absolutely crazy. It was like whatever part of my brain that hated it so much was completely uninterested in my imminent death and only cared about getting that stickiness off my skin. Brains are weird like that.

Before all oxygen flow to my brain was cut and my eyes closed, Rufus smiled from over my opponent‚Äôs shoulder. He held a frying pan. He opened his eyes wide and the dull thud of cast iron against the back of my assailant‚Äôs skull let out in the kitchen. The giant crumpled to the ground. It took us a few minutes to get out of there, because somehow, I‚Äôd gotten stuck under him when we fell. We left the loot we‚Äôd originally intended to steal and stopped to collect ourselves once we got back to the freedom and fresh air on the streets.

I pulled my pack of cigarettes out. All but two had been broken or gotten wet with all the food and vomit in the fight. Rufus took them from me. He lit them and passed on back to me. We sat on the curb smoking.

‚ÄúSHHHEEEEWOOOOO!!!!‚Äù He said giggling.

‚ÄúI know.‚Äù

‚ÄúMan, oh, man!‚Äù

‚ÄúThat was nuts!‚Äù

‚ÄúI know.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be telling that story for years.‚Äù

It was getting to be midnight, so we walked back up to our spot. We passed a fat man in a brand-new rain poncho and combat boots. The man banged a staff like Gandolf and demanded drugs from passersby. Everyone knew he was a cop, and no one messed with him. The streets are like that. There‚Äôs some unspoken release of information dispersed among us about undercovers and the like, the same way bees all know how to act in unison. They don‚Äôt talk. They just know, and so did we.

Back at the spot Rufus and I did our shots. We nodded. Before the sun came up, the cops were kicking me in the leg and telling us we had to go.",1534047909.0

I‚Äôll lay it out for you, but also for my own benefit in a therapeutic sense. I‚Äôm not gonna give you my life story, I‚Äôm not gonna give you a sob story about how I wasn't raised well, I‚Äôm not gonna tell you about belt buckles ripping up my back and damn well near getting infected. I‚Äôm gonna start you off the night of, and fucking well leave it there. It‚Äôs a story that happened in 3 minutes, and will take me a 12-chapter book to fully chronicle. I can‚Äôt prove any of this to you, but I can assure you it DID happen, and I DID go to a place in the perfect, sweet median between life and elsewhere.

Then without any more bullshit, here‚Äôs my tall tale.

We sat in a parking lot. Doesn‚Äôt matter where exactly. But it was in the ‚Äúless nice‚Äù side of DC. The side where you can see the Washington Monument, yet recognize that you are existing in the shadow of it. Where tenant buildings crumble and young adults puff blunts on the staircases, brutally ignorant of their potential, yet fully self-aware of their worth weighed by the neglect of their community. Where tens of millions are quickly poured without second thought into the beauty and prestige of a capital that they hardly take a part of.

The reason I was down here was to score. Score some heroin to be exact. That‚Äôs something that your narrator hasn‚Äôt been too upfront yet. I have quite a turbulent relationship with thoat powder, rock, cap, tar, and the sticky gunk with specks in it that you can‚Äôt be too sure about. It‚Äôs love-hate, you know? But it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve been loyal to and won‚Äôt go on leaving without a proper fight and messy custody hearing.

I won‚Äôt go into names here, so let me make that clear. The driver pulled into a spot where the overarching streetlight would be ideally placed to illuminate the neglected car‚Äôs interior. This was meant to allow use without sticking out in this place (it was relatively busy for a Tuesday night). I mixed up a small little pile of white, sloshed it around with the contents of an old hot water bottle, and drew it up through my rig (or a needle, for you normies).

When I pierced the easy-access vein on the top of my left arm, I dumped half of the murky red water in, and waited like I usually do out of some half-assed sense of safety. I usually wait for the rush to plateau before I clear out the whole barrel. This way, I wouldn‚Äôt literally kill my brain with pleasure. It‚Äôs a habit I‚Äôve maintained progressively less and less out of convenience and no real close calls. I slumped down into the seat, my joints falling away from each other into an infinite, sublime, warm comfort. A few seconds too early, I finished off my hit. 

The rush from the first half was still rising - the second hadn‚Äôt had time to start yet. I knew I was in trouble, and tried to make a sound. A dry groan pushed its way out of my lip but by then I was already well and properly fucked. I kept climbing higher, higher, higher‚Ä¶ a pause where all I saw was the back of the passenger seat, and then *black*.

Here‚Äôs where the ‚Äúreal‚Äù story begins.

I never really blacked out, though.

You know when you‚Äôre laying in bed? On the brim of sleep with your eyes shut, picturing yourself falling down? The moment before you hit, your body wildly jerks, although you‚Äôre fully aware it was all imagined. That‚Äôs how I came to. My high totally left me, I felt myself on the cusp of sobering up completely and the withdrawals were setting in - maybe it was panic. Naw, not this. This was inexplicable.

‚ÄúWelcome to the New Way of Life meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous, my name is -‚Äù

But it wasn‚Äôt my sudden sobriety that concerned me. It was the sudden change of scenery, and the change of scenery to the possibly worst place on this earth: an AA meeting.

Surveying my surroundings, I found a half-full room with heavy cigarette tar plastering already yellow and peeling wallpaper. Lights were dim, with one of the brightest bulbs flickering in 15-second sporadic bursts. It was epilepsy-inducing. Pretty aged and haggard characters in the front took long turns saying stuff, but I couldn‚Äôt hear all that well. A light, drilling hum quickly began, and subsequently worsened inside my head. No sound could penetrate this barrier. Occupant sharing this room with me were sparse. It wasn‚Äôt too easy to study them from lighting that seemed to cut plenty corners, but it was mostly men - maybe 5:1 ratio men to women. 

Shit... my back muscles began to start spinning into a fishing reel which pulled my whole body along like puppet string. Skin over my face contracted, probably giving me a hollowed appearance over my cheekbones. Maybe not - probably not. Felt awfully like that, though.

So, where the fuck was I? That‚Äôs what I wondered while my heart rate jacked. One moment I‚Äôm in a car, and the next thing I know I‚Äôm here. I can‚Äôt hear. I can hardly see. The ringing subsided - well, a bit. I could hear the man talking up front.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs welcome our speaker all the way from Anzio, Italy.‚Äù

Maybe two people clapped, the rest murmured. 

The collection basket was passed around.

‚ÄúBoot - alcoholic.‚Äù That‚Äôs how the speaker introduced himself.

‚ÄúBoot.‚Äù The crowd repeated in a monotone drone.

I could hardly hear the speaker, and struggled to pick up any bits or pieces. The ringing in my ears dissipated like a fog, but only slightly.

Tuning in, I realized that I missed the first, maybe, 15 minutes. As far as a life story goes, he was somewhere in his early adulthood.

‚ÄúSo, like I said, my father kind of groomed me for the family business.‚Äù

The basket inched closer, haphazardly thrown to whoever was on the right like a game of frugal hot potato.

‚ÄúI did the best that I could.‚Äù

An aged wooden bin, woven together with gnarled oak sticks landed on my lap - hard. Startled, I looked down. Facing back up at me was the pale head of a fair-faced women. Hair white and elaborately knotted. Nose slender and rounded at the bottom. Her mouth mocked some semblance of words, but it was futile. Some victim of decapitation. Dried blood crusted in mounds under her, as the mouth continued working. No words and no air escaped. Powder covered her face sloppily, which left a long-dried trail of tears down her cheeks. She looked to be some kind French royalty, recalling a high school history class where I hardly paid any attention at all.

My eyes teared up, I swallowed hard down on rising vomit. That vinegar taste of stomach acid coated my throat. 

Trying to disregard the very-much conscious head inside, I tossed I placed it carefully two chairs to my right. 

‚ÄúMy reign, slowly devolved, I guess you could say.‚Äù

I harshly snorted the creeping mucus trying to escape back up into my burning sinuses.

‚ÄúI fell into a slow decadence. The leisure of public office took front seat of the chariot.‚Äù

I looked around, careful as fuck, mind you. Panic made my breaths deeper, yet more shallow. Anxiety gripped at that magic nerve that connects the brain to spazzing muscles. The room was larger than I first thought, maybe ballroom-sized with rows of chairs facing towards the dark reddish wooden podium. Closest person was behind me to my right, two rows back. It was probably obvious, I admit, but I had to study his face. He was clothed in a puffy leather jacket, ruined by time and neglect. With arms crossed and his head down, I assumed he was asleep. As hard as I looked, I tried making out his face but all I could see was his stringy, sparse head of hair.

‚ÄúResponsibility went by the wayside. My palace soon devolved into wine-fueled orgies. The construction project from my bridge drained the royal coffers. Bodies started to rack up. Couldn‚Äôt be too careful.‚Äù

Jesus Christ, where was I? This is Hell. I knew this had to be Hell.

‚ÄúWhile I walked through one of my passageways, shadows casted by the crackling torches, one of my guards approached me. One of my Praetorian guards emerged from a side tunnel, knife in hand - I think it was Cassius. Anyway, a mob of them dressed in the height of fashion, plunged their knives in and out of my abdomen with animalistic grunts. I laid on that cold, black floor for what felt like hours before the torchlight extinguished. Now hear I am.‚Äù

Without noise or warning, a bony hand suddenly gripped down on my right shoulder like a vice. Call it imagination, but the fingers creaked like an antique door hinge. To be frank, it hurt like shit. Snapping my head to face the attacker, it was the man in the leather jacket. His facial features were soldered together, leaving his right eyelid to hang from his nose, lips nonexistent which bore bluish grey fractured teeth. Ridges and hard-set lines were the apparent signature left by a raging fire.

Words slithered out from his dead throat, which rang raspier than nails against chalkboard.

‚ÄúA newcomer, eh? You think that‚Äôs bad!? I burnt alive in a car crash. My grandson with me, at that! Took about ten minutes ‚Äòtill I died!‚Äù

I remember vaguely springing up with his hand still in place, a wet crackling noise eliciting from his shoulder socket. With that, the hand eased off and I bolted toward the back exit. The speaker stopped, and I could see out of the corner of my eyes all of the ghouls watching me.

Putting all of my weight into it, I leaned sideways and slammed into the bar of the metal atrium door. Thankfully, it gave way, and I kept sprinting. Took a few seconds to realize I was running back TOWARDS the podium. Like some mirror of space and matter, I was propelled in the opposite direction. Spinning around, this happened maybe 15 more times until I eventually stopped dead in my tracks.

Nobody spoke or moved. They all stared at the sudden intruder who just became totally self-aware of his situation. The speaker has a furious scowl warping his face. Towering over me, he walked slowly in my direction. I couldn‚Äôt move, no matter how hard I tried to lift either one of my legs. He lumbered closer and closer. Transfixed on his stroll, he was suddenly upon me, grabbing my tan shirt and pushing me to the ground. I realized very quickly that I couldn‚Äôt breathe. the fall knocked the air clean out of me. Gasping for air, the speaker‚Äôs face was mere inches away from mine. I was sure that this would be it. 

‚ÄúThat was awfully rude,‚Äù he said. 

I tried shaking my head ‚Äúno‚Äù wildly - scared literally to death.

‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre gonna -‚Äù

The man didn‚Äôt get to finish his sentence, but his faced cleared into a look of near-shock and a voice that sounded awfully like a woman escaped his lips.

‚ÄúAdministering another dose.‚Äù 

I sucked in a massive breath of air, filling my pained lungs. In that moment, my surroundings were made entirely clear to me. Sharp white light blinded me, and I leaned off the side of the gurney to vomit - much to the relief of my captors.

That very same voice that I heard moments before asked me, 

‚ÄúDo you know where you are?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes... I‚Äôm in the back of an ambulance, aren‚Äôt I?‚Äù",1534040539.0

I‚Äôve never had issues traveling with pills before, but I decided to look into it anyway. I‚Äôve seen some posts on here asking about traveling with pills, so here‚Äôs what TSA has to say about traveling domestically within the US with medication. The main highlight is that TSA does NOT require you to keep your medication in the original prescription container. 

 - You can bring your medication in pill or solid form in unlimited amounts as long as it is screened.
Medication in liquid form is allowed in carry-on bags in excess of 3.4 ounces in reasonable quantities for the flight. It is not necessary to place medically required liquids in a zip-top bag. However, you must tell the officer that you have medically necessary liquids at the start of the screening checkpoint process. Medically required liquids will be subjected to additional screening that could include being asked to open the container.

- You can travel with your medication in both carry-on and checked baggage. It‚Äôs highly recommended you place these items in your carry-on in the event that you need immediate access.

- TSA does not require passengers to have medications in prescription bottles, but states have individual laws regarding the labeling of prescription medication with which passengers need to comply.

- Medication is usually screened by X-ray; however, if a passenger does not want a medication X-rayed, he or she may ask for an inspection instead. This request must be made before any items are sent through the X-ray tunnel.

Don't do IV  cocaine either but for the love of jj please don't mix them and bang that shit. Do as I say not as I do.

I'm probably going to do another big one (biggest of the day) around 9 or 10 with another bar then go to bed around 11 or 12 whenever the coke fades. I have a decent tolerance to boy and girl but not xans. I really want to steal the declaration of independence or crown jewels but idk where the declaration of independence is and I don't think my country has crown jewels unless they stole some other countries crown jewels and they're hidden away somewhere top secret like that warehouse from Indiana Jones.

so i gave 2 to my friends, hit the pipe, and took 4 or maybe 5 pills. i didnt realize how dangorous it is to fuck about with these pills, but because i didnt notice any affect, so i thought they were duds, and just popped a handful down my guzzler. half hour later, i remember feeling paralized. awake, but anable to move any part of my body, except the middle and index finger of my left hand.

now i was trying to speak to my friends, but i was like dicaprio in the wolfe of wall street after popping the ludes. all i could do was dribble. then i blacked out.

When i woke up, it was daytime, my friends had gone. i got up groggily and stumbled around, then i realised i fucked up. I checked my phone, and it was 1:pm on tuesday. i took the fucking pills sunday night, i was shaking so bad, dopesick as hell . dunno how i passed out through withdrawals? like is that even possible?

It wasn‚Äôt because he wanted to eat it. He just knew it was what people did at parties and was doing his best to look normal.","I sat up. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not crying.‚Äù I said.

He told me he was sick. I forgot all about the Faceless One and Ally Alcoholic and everything Jimbo told me. Rufus had been through booking the day before and once he was booked they released him. A big city like that doesn‚Äôt have the resources to keep people jailed for minor things. The warrant was for an old shoplifting ticket and an unpaid fine. It wasn‚Äôt ever getting paid. The city knew that. We knew that. That‚Äôs just how it was. Next time they saw Rufus and recognized him, they‚Äôd run his name, and he‚Äôd go to jail again to be booked and released.

I showed him what I‚Äôd gotten from Jimbo and Fin the day before for Bug‚Äôs eye. He ran in place and let out a giddy laugh. It took him a few minutes to fix it all up, but once he did, he told me we were going to an office party that evening.

‚ÄúAn office party?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. Fat Channy wants us to go.‚Äù Those were his last words before he fell asleep. When the cops came I already had him over my shoulder and was walking across the street to the park where we usually spent the first parts of our days.

Chandra, or Fat Channy as we called her, had been off the streets for the last 9 months. There was no need for her to have that nickname, as there weren‚Äôt any other Chandras or Channys around to differentiate from. She was fat though and didn‚Äôt seem to mind. In the summertime she wore sleeveless dresses, so you could see where she‚Äôd been damaged in a fiery car wreck on the freeway years before. Paper bag flesh covered the unsightly striations and knots of scar tissue like chicken bone gristle holding her together inside. She wore braces made of metal rods and black Velcro. Most of her face had been left intact but for the crenulate trough of missing meat running from her neck and up into the cheek where veins and tendons had been borrowed. She looked lonely and hurt. Her eyes were kind and teeth pretty the few times she ever smiled.

We first started seeing her come around Pill Hill year or so before, always trying to trade or sell her Ativan and Vicodin for something better. On top of the accident, she‚Äôd been born with some disease the details of which were unclear but that‚Äôd given her rights to a lifetime supply of prescriptions for low grade pain killers and anxiety meds and antidepressants. She liked heroin and did meth sometimes. Unlike us though, she could keep an apartment and job. Her visits to the streets were always desperate but short lived. She never spent the night.

But somehow someone talked her into smoking crack. That was it for her. She‚Äôd kept her life together while using for some time, but less than a week after she hit the rock, she was living outside like the rest of us. Her health got worse. Rufus and I adopted her as a third in our party for a short while and pushed her new wheelchair for her. One day, her father came to get her. He put her in rehab. She‚Äôd gotten a job as a secretary and lived in a halfway house. We were her only friends and would now be her guests at the party for her office.

It was a regular day for us. Rufus nodded out. We sat on the sidewalk or on benches. When he was awake our heads swiveled on our necks back and forth like spectators at a tennis match. We watched the passing pedestrians. The city offered so much for us to see in a single sitting. There was a transsexual in red, horsehair extensions and Dorothy‚Äôs blue checkered vest from the Wizard of Oz and black leather combat boots. A street artist painted for a crowd. Another played drums on empty five-gallon buckets. Pigeons scavenged the sidewalks as dirty and desperate as we were. There were strange conversations. A 50-year-old man cried into his phone that his mother was too mean, that he wouldn‚Äôt give her this kind of power any more. The prettiest girl we saw that day wore face paint and talked to herself. Rufus drooled. He nodded. I bought a pack of Reds, which was half gone in a couple of hours. As the day cooled off and evening approached, Rufus woke up for good. He was ready to go to the party. We walked towards the address.

‚ÄúNow, when we get there, Boom Boom. We have to look normal. Ya know? Channy‚Äôs supposed to be doing well and all that, and she is, but you know, people like her coworkers, straight laced types don‚Äôt expect people like us to be coming to their parties. It‚Äôs vital that we seem as normal as is possible, my dear Boom Boom.‚Äù

I shook my head. ‚ÄúI know, Roof. I know. What‚Äôs that?‚Äù

He was bringing what looked like a Xanax bar to his lips with his fingers. ‚ÄúXanax.‚Äù

‚ÄúWHAT? After everything you just said?‚Äù This was Rufus‚Äôs super power. We all had superhuman powers as street addicts. Not that they were particularly helpful or did anything but hurt us, but they were things most humans couldn‚Äôt accomplish. Like this, with Rufus, the ability to hold within himself such glaring contradictions in thought, word and deed simultaneously and to be at such peace about it was extraordinary. He would have been a great cartoon character.

Needless to say, the party was a disaster for the first hour we were there. Not because of me though. Obviously, our grease caked pores and the raggedy seams of the fabric on our clothes and bags made our homelessness and drug addiction hard to hide. Fat Channy had been giving me worried looks as soon as she saw us. Perhaps she never considered how awkward it would be to have us there. But there we were. Rufus would try to hide his nods by picking up random objects and holding them to his face, like he was reading or studying them. He nodded off mid conversation with Chandra‚Äôs boss. From time to time I heard him telling the partygoers about how his last girlfriend had ripped him off or asking what they thought about how hard it was to find a public restroom in the city anymore. He didn‚Äôt realize that these were problems homeless drug addicts have. Regular people didn‚Äôt have these issues. Later, he tried to cut a piece of cheesecake. It wasn‚Äôt because he wanted to eat it. He just knew it was what people did at parties and was doing his best to look normal. Channy and I watched horrified. The piece Rufus cut was a lopsided square from the middle of the cake. He nodded out in the middle of transferring it to his plate and stood asleep in the way of everyone who came to get something from the drink and food bar.

Eventually, though, everyone was drunk. No one was lucid enough to notice or care that Rufus and I were obviously street people. Chandra didn‚Äôt feel embarrassed by it. Strings of lights kept the place dim and set the mood. Brains saturated in ethyl alcohol let loose from their lips low toned and lustful murmurings. Channy sat next to me on the couch. I put my arm around her, and she put her head on my shoulder. There was a stifled outburst of snorting laughter from another room. The cold metal rods of her leg brace pushed into my knee. Rufus had disappeared.

Channy whispered to me. ‚ÄúI got some meth.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I shook my head. As cold and calloused as the streets were and as ruthless and ridiculous as I‚Äôd become, I had no desire to watch this girl throw her life away again. Maybe it was an attachment developed from all that time we pushed her wheelchair around. Or maybe it was a latent affection for the hope she gave me. She got off the streets. She was sober and had a job.

Fat Channy wasn‚Äôt well, though. She could die if she started using again, but she was persistent. It was all we knew of each other and the means of our closest bonding. We locked the door to the bathroom and put the lid on the toilet down. She pulled out the bag and an old Kohl‚Äôs credit card to crush it up and snort. She bowed before it and pulled some into her nostrils. Then, I did. After that, I told her about my heroin. She insisted even harder than before that I share, which I did. Channy puked in the toilet.

It was getting late, and as we walked back out into the party, I wondered where Rufus had disappeared to. The front door opened. He walked in and whispered to me.

‚ÄúI gotta show you something.‚Äù He was staring at a drunk man in a nice button up shirt and loosened tie dancing by himself in the middle of the party. Everyone else had either left or slumbered in each other‚Äôs arms or made out.

We walked through the halls and up the stairs a few stories and came out on a level that had apartments. Apparently, he‚Äôd been prowling and ended up in one of them. Channy stayed back. That was the last we saw of her for a while. Rufus came to the door. He stooped and looked at me wide eyed with his pointer finger on his lips. He said it had been unlocked.

Inside the first thing I noticed was an unbearable stench. We crept around. Everything in the apartment seemed to be disproportionately large. The living room was covered in a foot or more of empty tallboys. There were smears of feces and blood on the floor which had been sprinkled over with sawdust rather than cleaned up. A bowl of fruit loops had been shattered against the wall. The cereal stuck solidified to the wall and floor. Grey colored bathwater sat an inch below a ring of grime on the tub. A giant pair of white briefs with thick brown streaks in the seat sat wrinkled on the floor by the toilet. Rufus pulled me into the bedroom and pointed to a piece of gold bullion on a mantle above the head of the bed. I jumped onto the bed. It was higher than most other beds I‚Äôd been on. It was also perfectly made and clean, unlike everything else in the apartment. The extra soft mattress, or maybe it was a waterbed, and comforter made it almost impossible to crawl across it. I was stuck.

I turned to Rufus and tried to tell him, but before I spoke, the front door opened. It bounced off the spring stop. Someone with a gruff voice cleared their throat, and elephantine footsteps could be felt in the floor. It was whoever owned the place. They were home.",1534003963.0
