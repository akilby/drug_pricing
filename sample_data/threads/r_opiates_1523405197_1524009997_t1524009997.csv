For the past 3 almost 4 years now, I've been able to keep my habit well under control. I only do pills (oxy and tramadol) as heroin is a much more slippery slope. I'm only 20 and as of recently I am now basically the boss at my great paying job meaning I am in charge of guys almost double my age because no one works even close to as hard as I do. I had my first few experiences with PK's when I was a sophomore in highschool. One of the kids in our stoner friend group had some sort of muscular atrophy condition I believe it was so he was always had a ridiculous amount of pills he would hand out to us like candy. The first few times I tried hydro and oxy it was fun but nothing I would go out of my way to get. It wasn't until a few years later that I tried again that my love for opis really started. I used to be a huge stoner because it would work wonders for my anxiety and depression up until I had a full blown nightmare acid trip. Ever since, weed has been ruined and that was about 4 years ago now. I do use them everyday after work. It might sound dumb but I have a personal rule where I won't get high until 5:00 or later if I'm still at work. I never work while high. I redose once at 8:00 or 9:00 and will very rarely redose for a second time. I never go more than a few weeks at a time without taking a tolerance break so that I don't become too physically dependent. I don't enjoy any other drug at all really and I have no intention of stopping anytime soon. I don't see anything wrong with my drug use as it's not hurting anyone else, it doesn't get in the way of my responsibilities. Addiction and health issues aside, I see my drug use no different than someone who get's stoned or has a few drinks every night. The concept is the same. ",1524009452.0

When I get itchy from heroin, I even say, ""I'm getting itchy again, must be the heroin."" and they just laugh like I am just joking, or when I go to buy my heroin, I straight up say, ""well, I gotta eat breakfast first, get my heroin, then I can pick you up.""

8d0xop,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8d0xop/tips_on_iv_drug_safety_from_a_medical_professional/,23,https://redd.it/8d0xop,benz0babe,TIPS ON IV DRUG SAFETY FROM A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL,"If you are going to go ahead and choose to IV your drug of choice then you might as well be as safe as you possibly can while doing so. So I am a trained phlebotomist which if you don’t know is somebody that taps veins and draws blood all day long. Below is a list of tips you should ALWAYS follow when shooting to preserve your veins, heart, and avoiding infection. 


CLEANLINESS/ STAYING STERILE:
Before beginning your session, always make sure that your hands are WASHED CLEAN and that the area that you will be having your substances and rigs is clean as well. 
Please I cannot stress this enough, use a brand new needle every time. Do not ever share needles with anybody else as well.  You can purchase them on Amazon in bulk for very very cheap. There’s no reason you should be using dull and all needles.
Clean the injection site with alcohol swab, rub the swab in a circular motion for 15 seconds. It should be 70% alcohol or higher.


 NEEDLES:
Use a new needle every single time if you can, if not use it only up to 4 to 5 times tops if your budget is tight. This is because the duller the needle gets, the more damage and scarring it will cause to your veins that is irreparable and nobody WANTS track marks. This is KEY to keeping your skin and veins in as good as a condition as you can while shooting. You wouldn’t even know I shot.

If you do reuse a needle rinse it and sterilize it if possible you can boil them in hot water on the stove. If you cannot boil it, make sure you thoroughly rinse it and store it with the cap on in a sterile place. I was also just told bleach is just as effective if not more!! May even be as easier option. 

Use the smallest gauge needle that you possibly can. This will obviously cause the least amount of damage.

And obviously before administration, make sure all air bubbles are removed my tapping the side of the syringe and pushing the remaining air out.

FINDING A VEIN:

Stay away from veins in your feet, 

Constantly rotate the sites that you use. It is not smart to keep going up or down a vein a half an inch and shooting multiple times in that area. You should let it rest and use a different spot.

Try to use your ante cubical which is the center vein in the ditch of your arm. If not, use any vein that is large and easily accessible. 

When tourniquetting, the rule of thumb is 4-6 inches above the injection site. Make it so that you can remove the tourniquet while injecting. I do this by having the end of it in my mouth or having a belt wrapped around under my thigh and up and over my arm and doing it that way.

Make sure the bevel of the needle which is the pointed opening is FACING UPWARDS. This is proper practice and less damaging to veins. 

If you are in a vein and did not register, DO NOT DIG AROUND. Pull out, get the air out, and attempt again. I CANNOT stress this enough!! This causes major scarring and damage to your veins. Think of it as taking a knife and cutting up your veins. Not good.

If you are using veins on your forearm that tend to roll you can use your tourniquet above the site as well as one below to keep the vein from rolling. 

Drinking water will help keep your veins open and more easily accessible so make sure to drink water and keep hydrated always. This is honestly a huge huge tip especially for people with smaller veins.



SHOOTING:

Once you have registered, pull back slowly and push a little bit in, register again and pull the plunger back to make sure you are still in the vein, push a little bit more in and register one more time to make sure you were in the vein. This is also a ridiculously important part. You will never ever get an abscess if you register three times. It makes me cringe when I see people register once and then slam the rest of the syringe.

As you are pushing the plunger in for the last push, you should be removing the tourniquet at this point. You MUST leave the needle in before you take the tourniquet off so that pressure is not shooting towards the injection site. This will cause bad damage to your veins and major bruising. 

AFTER THE SHOT:

Once you have removed the tourniquet, slowly remove the needle and have a paper towel or tissue ready to place MODERATE pressure on the site for a least a minute. This will prevent brusing. 

Put on a bandaid with a fresh piece of rolled up paper towel under it so it applies pressure and enjoy your high! 




SORRY FOR THE LENGTH! But this stuff is all so important guys. You literally cannot even tell I shoot up because of these practices. Enjoy guys! And PLEASE me know if you have any questions. I am more than happy to help you guys out with being safe. Message me anytime.

Right now when someone submits a fent warning we lock the post and 'sticky' it to the top of the page. This system used to work really well back when the vast majority of heroin was.....HEROIN! and not the other way around, as we can only have 2 things 'stickied' at once and we might have 3-4 warnings in one day.

There will now just be one post stickied to the top of the sub titled 'Fentanyl warnings and information' or something similar to that. Inside this post there will be some information that is common sense to some, and valuable to others; like where to purchase fent test strips, signs of fentanyl dope, and other stuff like that. There will also be all of the fentanyl warnings that have been submitted to us listed from most recent and getting older.

**You guys will still submit the fentanyl warnings the same way that you have been** and we will continue to lock them, but they will be compiled, linked to, and organized inside this one post at the top of the sub. There will also be some additional features added like searchable flair and some other little things.

If anyone has any questions or comments feel free to leave them here and we will address them. Thanks folks!

Within a week the bags were getting slacker, the dope shittier and I'd have to wait upwards of three hours just to score a shit, slack point of bap.

To top it off, this motherfucker wouldn't answer the phone half the time.  I ended up having to buy overpriced blues in the interim and texted him telling him that he had lost a $300 play.

He texted me back with ""money doesn't make me move"".

I broke off all contact with him after that and continued to buy overpriced blues until I got a solid connection that is ALWAYS fat and I come to them, not the other way around.  No waiting or any bullshit.

Used to wake up and when I took my first pills, felt amazing, how most of you feel. Last year found out about kratom. Started a bad habit of taking more oxy some days and supplementing with kratom on low days.

Somehow, early this year, after 4 years of taking opiates, the euphoria went away. Like tolerant 24/7 even though I have that microwithdrawal in the morning before dosing

Often when I get my new batch of oxy I set aside hard work ""treat"" days where I take like up to 50-80mg and borrow from other days (where I just do kratom and 10mg). 2014-2017 those days I'd be drooling in love with myself. Now, when I tried that past couple months, just felt no different than 30mg, but tired, very itchy, bad eyesight. Extra side effects, no bliss. I get a legal perscription 30mg for nerve pain,in my late 20's now so maybe age plays a role.

I got into potentiators from here when I was running low and got desperate to make every bit count. Grapefruit juice, tonic water and DXM at the end of high dosing days, because it's supposed to reset tolerance. 

Maybe it was that, maybe it was sometimes taking kratom on the same day as normal oxy dose, in the afternoon, when in the past only took oxy between 9am-2pm, and toughing through the afternoon crash

Maybe if I figure out what I did wrong, I'll learn something valuable about tolerance and getting the most of your opiates, something I can teach others to avoid so they don't have this happen.",1523996398.0

I just shot up a little while ago, after picking up my 2 month keytag.

I'm finding the same issues I had previously with NA still following me around. Basically, I don't like the culty-ness of it. I do like the comradery, the peer-to-peer support, I think that works amazingly well.


I can't even bring this up to my NA group or sponser because I get the canned response of ""well you're obviously not ready"" or ""you're not trying"" etc. I don't like how they will litterally harp and yell at a newbie if they use the wrong nonmenclature, etc.

edit: of course I'm not ready to get 100% clean, no addict is. See that's the problem, it's an all or nothing kind of thing. There's no middle ground I can shoot for and work my way up.



I don't like the ""obsessing about being clean"" aspect of it. I don't want drugs (or not using drugs) to be the main focus of my life.


I want to be able to use on the occasions I want to, and have the will power to say no when I know I'm encroaching physical addiction.

Basically, getting clean got me to a point where I could finally go to Central America and visit family.  I went, and was offered all the cocaine of  Central America for essentially peanuts.


So I bought the cocaine from some 12 year olds, and tooted my week away. I guess when I came back I wanted to do more of it, but cocaine is so expensive in the states and crap compared to the crap I was buying off the children.


Getting sober is a nice (lofty) goal, and I'd like to attain total sobreity, but not at the cost of my sanity.  IMO, living a life these NA hardcore people live, where it's constantly ""meetings this, sponser that, meeting, meeting...etc"", that's not what I want.


I guess what I'm saying is IDK what to do. should I continue on the NA path? or just give it up entirely? Or somewhere in between?

Non hateful opinions are welcome!

As are hateful ones, just remember you're being mean to someone who loves you.


and I *really* love you.


I don't feel like I failed, I feel like I hiccuped, and need some direction. Is there any way to balance this? Being a junky is no good, but being a NA-addict, is equally as bad imo.",1523980713.0

Also, what are your methods for getting your powder the finest?","Haven’t seen a post like this in a while. Everything is drug porn, candy porn, newb questions, etc. All are fine of course but wanted to change it up a bit. 

My ritual is that I have a box I keep everything in that has a nice smooth side. It’s from a pair of wireless Bluetooth headphones and has perfect little compartments inside. I keep everything inside and take out what I need. 

My ROA, contrary to my user name, is to sniff everything. It’s something I started a long time ago and I think I’m more addicted to sniffing sometimes than the drug itself (not!). 

My DOC, which are oxy 30’s (A215 baby) come out, usually 2-3 depending on if first dose or not. I also take out my card, my straw, lighter and my clean (as it can be) dollar bill. 

Turn box over on my lap, so smooth side is on top and put dollar bill on top of pills. Put lighter sideways at first to make the initial crush. Once somewhat crushed I then turn lighter vertical and run everything over with the bottom of the lighter. I feel I get a better connection with the top of the box in order to crush everything finer. 

Once I get it as fine as I can I then scrape the dollar bill off as much as possible.  I know I shouldn’t because money is gross but to make sure nothing goes to waste I wipe the dollar and lick my fingers, then use wet fingers to clean rest of powder off dollar. 

Then use the card to chop away. 

This is where my second question comes in. I feel I can only get the powder so fine, and knowing that the finer the powder, whether it’s pill powder or H powder, I am curious what other methods people use to get the finest of powder. 

Next I line everything up and use the straw to take me to euphoria. I sniff as light as possible so that the powder coats my inner nostrils and does not go to my throat. A drip is inevitable but try to lessen as much as possible. (Btw, I love the way an oxy drip tastes)

I usually do this in my car which is parked in my apartments underground garage, so I feel safest there. I made a post the other day about how I go about doing it at work; which is a whole other ritual in itself. 

So, opi fam, if you’re bored and want to contribute, what is your ritual?? Because let’s face it, it’s all we have to keep us sane...",1523965761.0

I have been a consistent user of oral synthetic opiate painkillers for several years and have developed a pretty massive tolerance. Obviously my standard dose has increased steadily  all while using the same medication and suddenly in the last three weeks or so something really weird has happened.  (and just to clarify yes I have confirmed the meds I have are the same, legit script I've been using, I'm not suddenly taking some fake pills with fent in them or something). 

But suddenly the dose I have been consistently taking, one which I very gradually built up to and have very established, consistent reaction to, was too heavy for me to the point of pretty significantly needing to reduce my dose and now literally only over the course of less than a couple weeks I've had to reduce my dose to what it was almost like a year and a half / two years ago, and it's still feels like it's maybe a bit much. 

Basically it's like I've experienced a sudden and inexplicable tolerance drop without having reduced my dose or frequency of dosing. Has anyone experienced this? Is it possible that there's some kind of latent medication built up in my system over the years that is multiplying my normal dose to be more potent?

I know to some people this must sound like the dream, a sudden tolerance loss without having to take a break but it's also kind of bizarre and frightening as I want to be careful and safe as well (as much as one can be). 

Any similar experiences or insight much appreciated.

I know about that, but I wanted ask how likely is it really, if one was to try some 10mg oxycodone IR, to get addicted.. I am just curious, because every time someone posts about wanting to try oxy, so many people advise against it in a way that reminds me of the horror stories of DARE campaign.. as I said, I understand opiates are a very slippery slope, I just wanted to ask if I'm missing something? 

Thousands of people are given oxy's every year for acute short term pain, yet they don't become addicts.. how much more addicting is this stuff really, compare to say 100mg of tramadol or 150mg of codeine (10mg oxy I mean, as they should not be drastically different in terms of strength..)?? if one is in a good mental state (no trauma, depression, anxiety), is this stuff as addictive as it appears form the comments deterring people from trying it even once?? 

I understand that every addiction started with that first dose and it's always better to deter people in case they would like it too much, instead of glorifying it. But I wonder if the way people respond to first time use questions is not too over the top?? Did your view on life drastically change after the very first dose?? Could you not stop thinking about the feeling for a very long time, until you went for more?? 

I'm just trying to understand, as I have had codeine and tramadol (as well as lot of other non-opiate drugs) and while they were pleasurable and I always felt like having some more for 1-2 days after, that feeling always subsided... Is oxy really that different from both weaker opiates (codeine, tramadol) as well as other dopaminergic drugs (coke, dexies, ritalin, aderall)??

I'm just asking cause this is such a lovely community of supportive people and it kinda struck me how strongly you are trying to deter others from trying from trying opiates in a way that almost seems too over the top (DARE type propaganda).. I'm not saying that you are overstating the risks, that's basically what I'm asking about.. Would you say the replies are 100% accurate (trying it once poses a major risk), or are they perhaps influenced by you guys seeing opiates taking so much away from you and your loved ones (and therefore a bit overstated, due to emotional involvement)??

Sorry for the long set of questions, just wanted to clarify, hear some stories and maybe get a discussion going..

I have tiny veins and had nurses miss them a lot when setting up ivs in the hospital so I have a ton of anxiety associated with needles going in my veins to the point that I have to be distracted like a child by medical staff. I honestly can't see myself ever doing it by my own free will, but I've had a few dreams in which I inject dilaudid, so I know it's in my subconscious somewhere.

**Via Cliff**
Buy dope on pay day through Cliff, inevitably loan $100-$150 so he can have dope. Thus effectively halving that which is available for my immediate consumption while spending double. Sure, I'll eventually get it back. One time surprisingly mostly in cash but often in pill form which cannot be spent on bills, Amazon or in most retail stores. For returning readers, I need not list the times in which Cliff engaged in shady shenanigans but for the unfamiliar search for posts with the flair ""Cliffpost, and ""Cliff Post!"". Entering the search query as *flair:Cliffpost* and *flair:Cliff Post* in the right side search bar for this subreddit seems to find all of the flared Cliffposts.

&nbsp;

**Via Tim**
Buy through my long time friend Tim. Not an option anymore. After the second time I bought through him, he went to a local hospital that had sort of ""three day detox"" program followed by being inducted into a Suboxone program. I don't know if he fell off the wagon since last week, I hope he is still clean. In his words, ""I spent over forty grand in the past two years."" He told his wife that he went into the program for ""opiates"" because he'd be on the street if his wife knew he was on heroin. I spoke to him briefly today and he said he'll contact me in a couple of days as he has a busy night and day of work ahead of him. I only bought dope through Tim on two occasions but both times everything went smoothly. He took whatever I offered as a middling fee without complaint and even offered subsequent fair trades without making me feel pressured to trade. For example, ""would you like to trade some of your bags for this many subs?"" He was also cool because he fronted the dope for me and based on my good word.

&nbsp;

**Via Derrick**

Derrick is Cliff's primary middle and Cliff often tells stories about him pulling shady shit. I suspect about 50% of the stories are made up shit, some of them are projections of Cliff on fictitious personification of Derrick. Other times Cliff makes up stories about Derrick in order to explain why the current order is a little short. When Cliff first started getting dope, Derrick would give him bags (10 bags to a bun) that were taped shut. Derrick claimed the dealer did this to ensure that any middle wouldn't tamper with them. When Cliff met Derrick's dealer, the guy said he did not put tape on the bags. It turned out that Derrick was taking shit out of the bags then taping them shut to make it appear like he couldn't have.



After Tim went on the wagon, I decided to bypass Cliff and buy directly from Derrick. First order was three buns, I gave Derrick half a bun for middling. I figured if I was generous he would be less likely to scheme. For that and the subsequent order Derrick did state he didn't care about the middling fee, that he was just doing me the favor. Of course I knew he wouldn't middle out of the kindness of his heart. Well, that first order, instead of ten bags to a bun as Cliff normally gets, it was four fatter bags. Since I was to receive 2.5 buns, the first bag represented one full bun. The remaining three were supposedly half a bun each. Derrick emptied one out to show me how it broke up into a number of lines. Then upon departure he said ""check it out, let me know what you think.. if any of the bags appear too small, let me know and I'll tell the dealer so he can include an extra bag on the next order."" Pretty sketchy to me. I have no idea without a scale or a reference that I'm accustomed to such as the buns that are divided into ten bags. In Derrick's words, it was quicker to have the dope ready in this form. The reason Cliff always gets ten bag buns is because ""he's mad stingy.""


&nbsp;

**In Conclusion**

Doing business and getting dope through Cliff is risky and generally sucks. As a fellow opi redditor once said, ""Cliff makes doing dope unfun."" Dealing with Tim was sunshine and roses but it ended too soon and I really can't complain for the sake of his family life and well being. Derrick is shady AF. Nice enough guy, hasn't had an opportunity to screw me over and put me through tribulations like Cliff has. Hell, he gets blamed for some of the shit Cliff has done when it was totally Cliff. Nonetheless, It's not viable to do business with Derrick in lieu of Cliff with the expectation that I'll get a fair shake. With my current options I will not get a fair shake. Thus, I'm better of sticking with subs and keeping my money.

Now about that writer's conundrum. I've been writing a Cliffpost. Wrote it three times, three different ways but it keeps coming out long. My last attempt has good grammar and makes sense to read for the most part but it's just very long and I don't want to post a wall of text even if I keep the paragraphs neat separate. I'm tempted to seek an editor but I don't want to waste someone elses time. 


On another note, someone said ""if only you put such effort elsewhere, you could succeed at anything."" So before I wrote the most recent Cliffpost draft for the third time I spent over two hours working on a book. I always considered writing a book, well two types of books.. One educational and another fictional. I'm glad I spent time on that, I don't actually know how books are written and how people make some books so damn thick but with self publishing being a thing, it's a worth a shot to engage in such an undertaking.

-crushing the dope (I get rocks a lot) into the FINEST powder I can get it.

-separating the lines so that each one is very narrow and small. I heard this helps it absorb better in the mucous membrane. Fat lines are tempting but it gets me higher to break a fat line into many smaller lines.

-barely snorting (so that it doesn’t go down the throat and cause oral ingestion and a drip). I almost always make sure now when I sniff the dope that I’m not doing it hard enough to make a loud noise with my nose.

-straw farther up the nose.

-I was told to try and putting a few drops of water in each nostril beforehand. This seems to work really well.

Currently, she is taking half of a 10/300 before she goes to bed. If the pain becomes too bad, she will take a second half of the tablet. She is only taking half a tablet because taking a full tablet makes her feel to groggy and spaced out the next morning. (She is a college professor, she needs to be ""on"" by the time she gets to her first class.) 

She also mentioned that the vicodin doesn't seem to be touching the pain. I have urged her to ask the doctor about the possibility of a stronger painkiller such as percocet, but she is hesitant about doing so because she figures that it will make her even more groggy the next morning. 

I figured that this would be a good place to ask for advice. I have two questions: First, in your experience, is percocet likely to be a more effective painkiller than vicodin? Second, do you find that percocet makes you groggier in the morning? 

I realize that everyone experiences these drugs in different ways, but it would be nice to have some more data points.

I subtly think my pharmacist may be a user. Maybe switching out legit stuff and keeping them? I don’t know. I’ve been short a pill or two at times, but never bitch cause he has never given me shit for filling a day or two early. These say on the bottle that they are Purdue. But they crumble apart with scissors.

This is a legit script, I just want them instant so I use the coke trick. Cut them up as small as possible. USUALLY they are a fucking pain, hard and gummy at the same time. But these break into tiny pieces. I can post pictures, but figured I’d start here

But these crumble. Like 2 cuts and they are broken up. I put a small piece in my mouth, and it gelled up but barely.

My fear is I take like 160mg at a time. If these weren’t legit, that would be bad.

I know he is on methadone, black, foilies of Coke, and I think that's all. Not completely sure. 
Do I need to be worried,? Because I am. Should I shoot him with the narcam I have, if I do he will get so pissed and maybe beat me up. If he needs an ambulance I would have to figure how to get someone 100+pounds on me whose paraniod from Coke to a car that is three small flights of stairs away plus I have a fake leg that I probably shouldn't add 200+ pounds too. Because I can't call an ambulance to my house especially for him especially for this reason. So I would need to know what to do quickly. 

Also something peculiarly odd is his pain tolerance is very low. I accidentally stepped on his foot. I had shoes he didn't. I didn't stomp or grind it or anything just accidentally stepped on it and now he is in excruciating pain. Keeps groaning and going oh my God grabbing his leg just acting like someone is driving a nail through it and it seems as though that shouldn't cause that much pain. Especially on dope methadone which should control pain and tons of euphoria from Coke and whatever else he may have taken/ the cuts in what he took.

How do you make yourself feel like you’re worth something again?","I’m sorry if this isn’t really allowed. I just don’t know what to do, and this community always seems so tight knit and supportive. 

I’m at the end of my rope. I’ve been a failure all my life, I live in the middle of no where, I have no license so getting a job is nearly impossible. I have no friends in my area, and the one light of my life, my boyfriend, is hundreds of miles away in the US, completely out of my reach. I haven’t seen him in months and it kills me. I don’t feel like I’ll ever see him again, especially my if I continue to be a failure at finding a job. He’s already paid for one plane ticket for me to visit him, I’m not going to ask him to waste his money on me like that again when I can never give him anything proper in return. 

In my depression I’ve turned hella suicidal and spend any moment I can trying to get high off whatever I can find. I’ve been mysteriously sick for years and throw up multiple times every day, I can barely keep any food down, I get malnourished and dehydrated regularly, and unless I have something for my nausea like weed, I just end up throwing up my food hours later. Doctors are incredibly dismissive of me. They all chock it up to anxiety or a pregnancy that simply cannot and does not exist, none ever want to run any real tests. 

I recently got kicked out of my apartment by my incredibly abusive roommates, they had me walking on eggshells 24/7, it destroyed me mentally. When I left I wasn’t able to take my bed home with me, so for months I’ve been stuck on a thin futon mattress that heats up like a furnace underneath me as I sleep, and I wake up every few hours drenched in sweat but freezing cold from the air of the basement. 

Every moment is miserable. I don’t know what to do anymore. If I wasn’t such a coward I’d kill myself, I probably just should. I’ve never done anything of worth in my entire life, the only good to happen to me was posting a single comment in a fan fiction forum that introduced me to my boyfriend and best friend for the better part of a decade, but I don’t think I’ll ever see him again. I know I cause him pain, too. He knows I’m sick and in pain and depressed to the point where he doesn’t know if I’ll be alive when he wakes up, and it causes him so much pain. He can’t sleep, he gets anxiety attacks and even his family’s noticed he’s been off kilter. I just drag everyone around me down. 

Is there any way to get out of a hole like this? Or am I really as fucked as I feel like I am. I just don’t know. Delete this if it’s too much of an off-topic rant, I don’t even know why I bothered typing this whole thing up. Guess I just needed to straighten out my thoughts. Some successful stories of people salvaging the shreds of their lives might help my outlook right now, if anyone has an uplifting tales...

Its been a little over a month-ish. (Dont know exactly when I stopped and i hate counting days).

This past week or so has been pretty brutal as far as cravings and anxiety go. It had been beating me down pretty hard and i was starting to begin the process of rationalizing a relapse. 

Tonight I said fuck it and ended up driving to a head shop to see if they sold kratom. I knew the chances of it being any good were slim and already held pessimistic views on its ability to be of any use in preventing a relapse despite all of the testimony to the contrary. But i was gonna give it a shot. So i bought a  bottle of bali capsules. And holy shit did they blow my mind. It was pretty subtle at first but after a while i began to feel like i had popped a couple vicodin. I only had to take 3gs too which was another surprise. I figured after a years long heavy habit such as mine, Id have to take at least 5gs to get any effect.

So definitely will be looking into vendors and buying more. The stuff i got from the head shop...i know its good but fuck its expensive. 15 bucks for 17 grams. Was mostly to find out if it would work and that it did. 

TLDR: skeptic decided to give kratom a shot before relapsing and was overwhelmingly satisfied. ",1523859402.0

I ended up grabbing just one bag off a cold cop spot while waiting for my main dude to be ready in a few hours (It was 6am). I shot the bag and awake hours later to somebody knocking on my window telling me I need to get the fuck out there and get rid of the shit on my lap (rigs, ect) I then went and met up with my regular guy and decided I'd wait until I got back to college to use again so that wouldn't happen.

Thanks to the advice and encouragement of you beautiful people, I got a new plug!

I woke up this morning sick as fuck. None of my people were answering my texts, and they / been since Friday.. so I decided today was the day. Im cutting out the middle man. 
LI drove across town to the plugs house. I was nervous.. what if he didn't remember me.. what if he thinks I'm the cops.. what if he thinks I'm trying to rob him and he shoots me through the door. Between being sick and the numerous ways this could go wrong, my anxiety was through the roof.

I knock... No answer... This is a terrible idea..

I knock again... Still no answer.. he's not going to go for this... Or maybe he didn't hear me.....

I ring the door bell.... His girl opens the door, and walks away.. ""lock that door behind you."" 

I'm in!

I go in and he's sitting on his bed.. scale and bag read and waiting. I explain to him that I was supposed to be meeting the middle, but he's bullshitting, so I figured I'd knock and just go straight to him. And I'll be damned.. ""Cool. Whatcha need?"" 

I left with a gram and his phone number.

An hour later the middle is calling and texting me, threating to kill me and calling me several unimaginative bad words. He says the plug won't fuck with  me anymore. But money talks.. we'll see what he says when I come by and buy my weekly ball. I can't imagine he'll turn that down.

So thank you friends! It worked! I'm plugged in!! X

So this Dr, he ended up having me do an updated MRI (which sucks fucking assss I hate that machine) and we ended up also getting some new X-Rays on my lumbar. Before any meds, he made me do an epidural in my spine and yes I was asleep! LOL i was not ready for that. Few days later i told him it made it worse (truth), and so long story short he prescribed me x120 10mg Oxy-Hcl because I told him Ive had flare ups in the past and that was my typical prescription from the past- which was completely true.

Week or so later I get the results and went over it with the Psychiatrist - Turns out it says in some for or another for pain pills and medications I has been using for years now, including benzodiazepines, list them as ""Serum level may be decreased, an increased dose would be required) - **In other words theyre saying dont prescribe them this.** BUT anything in the ""stimulant section"" all had green marks, WHICH PISSED ME OFF, I WAS LIKE WOW WORLD I DONT DO STIMS AND THIS IS WHAT YOU DO TO ME?! (Sarcastically yelling lol)

I go in for my follow up appt with my spine doc and what not, and by then he got the test results of course. We do a few routine things and when we get to medications he says he wont prescribe me the same script, BUT he said he'd be willing to give me the same dose in HYDROCODONE (GENERIC OF COURSE). I tried to keep my cool because it made completely no sense. 

His excuse was ""well hydro usually last a bit longer in your system than oxy does"" and I say back something on the llines of ""whats the point of it lasting longer if it's a less efficient pain med and I would end up having to suffice by taking more since it would be less effective"" 

He wouldnt budge, I tried telling him in some form or another that he's incorrect by switching me to hydros but he didn't budge at all. I explicitly told him that I did NOT want OXY as my long term pain management, JUST ONLY for this new disc that is pushing against my nerve canal and is causing sciatica pain and overall discomfort.

I said fuck it, trying to not argue with him so I wouldn't portray addict-like behavior and got the script upstairs at their pharmacy. OBVIOUSLY AS EXPECTED IT WAS SHIT good for pain which caused me to use more way more. (AND I TOLD HIM THIS WOULD HAPPEN SINCE THEY'RE LESS EFFECTIVE......!) I got the Mallincrodt M367 10/325.

I ended up calling him a few weeks later and told him my rant and how they're not effective and its causing problems at work and so on. He said if they werent working than my other options ""per my results"" said I can do either surgery or fentenyl. I couldn't believe he was going to offer me fent, but not oxy... even worse suggesting me to do back surgery. Ive seen so many specialist over the years and they ALL said to NOT do surgery unless i absolutely needed to because of my young age. We argued and went back and fourth so much I had to hang up on him before I snapped on him.

* I'm scheduled for a second opinion Wednesday morning, and since I've scheduled it I'm getting nervous she'll tell me the same thing since the last doctor I seen was the head off the pain management section. I dont know how else to express to them that the oxycodone is so much better for my pain than hydrocodone is, without making it sound like you're a pill seeker. I even have like 30-20 Norcos left and its been way over a month now, that's how much they don't work.

**ANY ADVICE ON HOW TO APPROACH NEW DOC TO GET MY USUAL SCRIPT AGAIN??**

tl;dr - Getting second opinion for my back problems but the ""old"" doctor is the head of the pain mngnmt section. They want to give me hydros rather than oxy",1523838231.0

The other, a gorgeous, thicc black chick who digs my sense of humor, has started to unreliable, and only available at weird times. She has decent stuff for 60/g. But only if you catch her during her weird hours.

Today, hitting my spent foils to keep the vomit down, I found my old black book of numbers I didn't want to lose. Among the entries in that hallowed text, I found one that i remembered being good.

I make contact, place my order, and head to the spot. Dude is late, of course. But he is remorseful, legitimately. He threw in an extra dub and bought me taco bell cause he was late. If I wasn't sober and sick, I would've chalked it up to doap brain.

In short, got a new plug that is around 24/7 who is cool AF. Just jumped to the top of the list. Buying your first time custie taco bell will do that, plus throwing in that extra dub, which he insisted on showing me on the scale.

In some ways the act of being all stealthy in order to get high, particularly with IV usage almost kind of a rush in of itself? 

Just that you know you’re doing something “naughty”, and then getting away with it, and then the physical rush of the actual opiate upon injection. That psychological thrill I get when I have my dope & needle, got it all mixed up in a syringe that’s in a vein, followed by the (second, obviously) BEST part of the process, registering the needle by pulling back on the plunger. As soon as that lovely warm, red blood floods into the syringe I know all that’s left to connect the current psychological high to one of the most satisfactory physical feelings in the world is the simplest action ever, pushing the plunger down. 

I know a lot of people (especially when dopesick) say they wish they could and would if they could, take everything involving heroin or other opiates back. Sometimes when I’m sick too I might slightly agree, but I tend to brush that aside, sorta like how people say they “Will NEVER drink AGAIN!” while hungover as hell, but then inevitably do (usually).

This is where your opinions come in. I was planning on using kratom tomorrow (day 1) to just kinda get through the day. Day 2 is normally where my junkie brain tells me to go cop so eat the half/piece of the sub to block then use the other sub to try and get me through day 3 and hopefully 4 at which point I'll go back to the kratom.

-Plastic drugstore pill crusher (screw round piece into dish). Doesn't work ... beads too small and hard.

-Mortar & pestle. Beads just squash into gummy flat things with no powder (that's if they don't go bouncing off into the abyss).

-After crushing, soaking with vit C and some heat etc. Doesn't dissolve. And when I do shoot the mix (filtered to clear) I get no high.

End up having to dump the mix in my mouth. They work fine orally even after trying to soak out the drug, which suggests that none of the drug is dissolving in the water mix.

I commented that while all healthcare should be accessible/affordable, its pretty uncaring/messed up to say that an addict’s life is somehow less valuable than someone with allergies. 

Now, I know better than to get too political or start fights on social media but I just had to pipe up and try keep this harmful mindset from spreading. The girl never commented back but I looked today and she took down the post! I wasn’t mean, just simply stated that we should fight for everyone to have access to the care they need and no one deserves to die due to a corrupt system. I really hope it made her reflect  a little about these things; and how what may seem like a witty meme can actually be harmful to how we try to view problems in our healthcare system.

So my question is are there is tips y’all have to getting the most outta my hard? Like I put super small pieces in and just hit it with a lighter. But I feel like I’m wasting some cause I feel like I’m burning a little that’s why I’ve started to put super small pieces in. So is this correct and is there anyway to scrap the pipe or anything to get a few extra hits when I’m out. Like with H you can wash your cotton, is there anything like that for this? Hey, thank for everyone that answers and is helpful!! You rock! 


Edit: and how often am I supposed to add new chore boy to it?",1523815219.0

I am (was) a Registered Nurse. I got addicted to pain pills like 10 years ago after an injury. So, being a nurse, I had super easy access to pills. After a few years, I got caught writing scrpits for myself. Now that is some serious fucking shit. Being as I am a ""good person"" for being a ""nurse"" my employer and the police chose to give me a break. OK, great. Of corse, I was fired from my job, lost my house, my car, my Nursing license and my whole life went to shit. So, rather than killing myself, I got into recovery. I did all the meetings and blah blah blah, got on suboxone (which is another fucking nightmare) and I got through it. Slowly, over the YEARS, I got my shit back together.  I got my nursing license back, I got another RN job and worked and lived like a ""normal person"" for about a year. Seeing as I was doing so good in my life, I figured it would be a GREAT time to relapse. I figured this time, I would be smart enough NOT to get caught. I would be smarter about it this time. Rather than write scripts in my name, I decided to write scripts in someone elses name. It was easy to get the medications delivered to my work and I got away with it for about 6 months....until one day...I got caught again. SHOCKER. Like honestly what the FUCK is wrong with my brain? Again, I was fired, my employer called the police on me and the Department of Health suspended my nursing license. As I sat at the police station with the narcotics detective this time, I was being charged with Medicare Fraud, possession of a controlled substance, misappropriation of property and some other shit I do not even remember. I was like, OK, Ill go to jail. I did not even give a fuck at all about anything and honestly, I felt like I deserved it. I deserved to go to jail. I have never been there before but fuck, if I keep doing this stupid shit, jail might help me to stop. Again though, since I am a ""nurse"" and a supposed ""good person"" no charges were filed, I did not go to court, jail, or anything. I can get my nursing license back again, and I can work as a nurse again but it will take AT LEAST 2 years of monitoring by an MD, weekly urine tests, monthly progress reports about my recovery submitted to the Department of Health, weekly Nursing groups, a fuck load of dedication and not to mention the thousands upon thousands of dollars to pay for this. Is it even worth it anymore? I really do not know. On on hand, I want to be a nurse again because I LOVED my job. It defined me as a person. Without my job, I am really nothing. On the other hand, I really just want to take this opportunity to start using bigger and better things such as heroin. I know how fucking stupid this may sound but I figure, why not? I have already destroyed my life, my family left me, my friends are long gone, I have already lost everything that I cared about so why not just say fuck it? It just takes too fucking long to rebuild life after everything has been lost. I have already done it once, I just do not have the energy to do it again.",1523812283.0

#Living Dead

Like so many before,

And so many to come.

The rest of you,

May think were dumb.

A waste of space,

Of life,

Of air.

Some of us hurry,

But we'll all get there.

Destiny.

Choice.

Maybe just,

Hear my voice?

None of us scared,

Intimidated or dared,

Its just what we want,

Why do you care?

So look to your heart,

And then in our eyes,

Some of us die,

While we're still

I did heroin before fentynyl started coming to the area and when the new white dope came around it quickly became the only shit that could get me high.  Through my travels I've noticed that there is a difference in some users experiences with the drug. While in most people the effects are typical I've noticed an additional effect in a select few. I do not want to come off as insensitive in any way to anyone that experiences these effects that I am about to discuss, I am just curious if anyone else has noticed this definite pattern of behavior from other people or is it just me? 
  To begin I will start with the similarities of what I have seen these people doing. They usually start out with that swaying, dance fighting type moves, a lot of them clap, stomp around like they are a giant, some jump around in one spot. They sometimes do weird things with their fingers like crack them strangely or look like they are trowing up signs. They begin to talk to themselves and then the yelling starts. Every one of them uses multiple voices almost like they are acting out a conversation between multiple people and they use a different voice for each person. For some people you may only see one or two of these behaviors but the majority of them have the voices and/or have a conversation with themselves every time. The voices that are used are those of either a woman or a child, even when the user is male. I have noticed there seems to be a pattern that I am seeing but I do not want to share that at this point until I can get some sort of confirmation with others that may see these behaviors in people that they know.  Ive briefly looked to see if anyone has mentioned these affects anywhere on the internet and it seems as though none of this is being documented or reported.  While it does not affect me in these ways  i feel like its a real problem that needs to be looked into any experiences are appriciated",1523801924.0

And with that comes levels of loneliness never thought attainable. Well. If you're like me and you all are, which is why we get on so seamlessly; so nicely, you make these little-while friends any way you can. And sometimes these friends can't talk back. I'm sure you've all, at some point or another, befriended a stray cat or a homeless guy or a cloud or what the fuckever, just someone whose friendship you hadn't sought out but it fell in your lap, misery loves company and all that rot. And you embraced it because, well, every now and then we get low. So low. Too low. So it's a nice thing to have another to just be there beside you. Even if they're crawling up the wall. 

Well, I've been in one of these funks, in a bad way and even though we know it will pass, in the thick of it, it only feels like the first half of an eternity. Look, I'll admit it. I made friends with a bug. A ladybug, so at least I had some companionship with potential for a relationship but I wasn't so far gone that I didn't think for a second it wasn't a bug. But anyway, this little ladybug would crawl around my wall near my bed every day for the past two weeks. I mean, in a bugs life (our life, not the film) that's close to a Chinese empire's rule. That's forever. 

So, I'd be there, alone, sad, full of heartburn and dwindling booze, escaping warmth that came with the pills and an ever growing high tide of depression and I'd look over and she'd be there. This little tiny bug. A nothing. A hardly noticeable being that would walk and stop and walk and stop and crack open her back and lift her little plastic wings and flutter an inch or two and settle, still in eye-shot. It was company. I know it's insane, I'm not insane. It's insane but I swear I'm not insane. I think. But it was company. It was this thing that I could look at and truly tell myself, without any stretch of technicality or rationalization, that I wasn't alone. I wasn't. I had a pet. A pet I couldn't pet but a pet nonetheless. 

Well, we hung out off and on, playing the office on repeat back to back in a row for the 3rd time in my life, first time for her, I'm sure, I'm assuming but we watched. She really liked Dwight, I could tell. Personally, I'm not the biggest fan, I've grown to love jim and Pam but that's a whole other thing. Being my own therapist, without pay, mind you, I'm sure I'd just like a sweet girl. Obviously Michael is the reason to watch and the true best is David Brent but we can argue that in the comments. 

But we'd watch and Netflix would ask if we were still watching and we'd laugh and say, ""of course"" and hit play and continue on for another 3 half hours until prompted again. I wasn't alone. There was a little friend on the wall above my shoulder like just the angel without a counterpart. And just today, about an hour ago, I looked over and she was done. She quit watching, she quit crawling, she quit climbing the lampshade, no more random (to me) flutters and certainly wasn't venturing over to the pillow like that one time early on. She died. 

Now, she didn't overdose or anything, so I know I can't blame myself. In fact, I know she wished I'd lay off for a bit and maybe we could go out to the other side of the screen at some point. Or at least go down to the kitchen. But she's gone. And now I truly feel alone. I have literally no one near me that I can even look at that has their own agenda. And it sucks. 

Look, the whole point of this rambly, rambling nonsense is that when you feel more alone than you ever have, you aren't. If nothing else, I mean, *we* are here. But I get how that feels like it doesn't count. But don't feel like you're alone. We can all make ourselves get up and go outside and find a friend. Now, we also have to make sure that friend isn't going to hurt us but they are there. 

Okay. I've literally just realized that this is the most insane shit I've ever put to paper but whatever. Even if it's internet paper. Just, you're not alone and if you're unhappy reach out to someone, anyone. It will help. A first step doesn't have to be the destination. /r/Im14andthisdeep 

Okay. That's all. I had a friend. It was a little bug. And she just died. And I realize I need to shower and go try to be around people. We are social and it's really important to embrace that. 

I should truly try to stop. ",1523800984.0

I’ve been to 3 rehabs since my first one and I literally scored some dope the same day I got out every single time. Funny thing is, I hate being dope sick. It’s horrible. I go through all that crap, start to feel so great sober but I just end up giving in. 

I’m back to doing it every day again. Tomorrow is always the day I’m gonna try to not do any. Then that leads to I’ll just do one hit to get me through the day. To 2 isn’t bad to 3, 4, 5 and so on. 

I have a friend who works in the recovery business and he told me it’s scientifically proven that some people get to the point where they are addicted for life. No matter what they do, they will always go back to it. It’s like a point of no return and they can’t help it. 

The fact that I go to rehab, come out feeling great and can never even wait a day before I get high makes me worry a lot. 

Do I have any hope at all? I have cut back the past couple of weeks and I’ve made my dope last much longer. I’ve actually been proud of myself (which is really sad, I know). But what do y’all think? 

Thanks for all your comments ahead of time. People on Reddit are surpassingly always very supportive in situations like this and it gives me hope. But don’t hold back and just try to make me feel good. 

I plan on buying a bunch of Xanax soon and doing a detox on my own. That’s how I got through the dope sickness they last time I kicked without the help of a medical detox. Y’all have a good night. I’m nodding off.  (This isn’t a laughing matter but sometimes you gotta bring some levity to the situation). ",1523773377.0

Tar compared to fent in my opinion is much safer and has better legs although maybe harder on the veins. In my new town, in southern Ohio, what ive copped on the street is all powder dope. Some pure white, some white with a brownish tinge. Now this stuff in the mouth has an extremely low bitterness, and when snorted the smell reminds me almost of a perc 5 smell. (Yes I snorted those giant things when I was younger it was my intro to opiates.) All the powder dope I'd seen before now was when I lived in Europe and it almost always was very bitter and with a vinegar smell. Is the dope I've been getting fentanyl? It seems to have OK legs but then again its been years since I've done any opiates. What are the best indicators to make an educated guess of what this stuff is? (Some batches ive gotten have a weird coke like numbing in the mouth and throat but no coke flavor.)

ANYWAYS back to my post, I was super sick yesterday all day as I’m not mobile and had to wait for my girlfriends car, I went and bought a 60 of black and cooked up half of it and did the whole thing which is a pretty big shot for me atm since this relapse has only been going on a month or two, I normally go home and do it but he was about 20 minutes away and I was unbelievably sick, so I did it in the car, and boy was I high, I knew I was way too high to drive since I’ve had a DUI as well (on my 18th birthday of all days) and I did not want to hurt anyone, so I just parked down the street and listened to music and texted some old friends for about an hour at least. I just didn’t want to do something irreversible or even just get pulled over.

They’re able to continue living at home due to our parents fear of them failing if they were removed as well as the assumption that it wouldn't effectively resolve the addiction issue. Steps are taken to discourage their using such as removing access to their car, requesting monthly rent, and no access to internet. This does nothing to stop the usage behind closed doors sadly and he becomes highly aggressive and manipulative when confronted about it. False promises are made and the cycle continues. 

Recently they were given temporary access to the vehicle in order to attend a funeral but ended up using the vehicle to engage in what has been assumed to be stealing packages. They installed a lock on their room door to hide the products without getting permission which sparked action from our father to have him return the vehicle and remove the lock, both demands were brushed off. We forced entry to the room and discovered the many items which he was clearly using to fuel his usage. All items were bagged and removed from the room. Upon the siblings return he lost control and vandalized our fathers room door with a hammer as a petty act of revenge, I intervened and talked him down but he continued to yell incoherently. 

All attempts at reasoning with him resulted in aggressive responses, eventually my brother pushed our father out of rage where they were put in a choke hold by me to stop any further physical aggression, I held on to his neck while everyone was yelling frantically but let go after my father saw that he’d had enough. My brother eventually took a seat and the whole family was screaming at him for lashing out at my father. He finally attempted to have a conversation but it was full of redirection to my father and my faults.

We were considering calling the police when he shoved our father but opted not to after cooling off, it seemed like he was finally going to get kicked out but after making various false promises he is now putting all his stuff back in his room which blows my fucking mind. My family has always had a tendency to enable my brother after so many failed attempts at rehab and self attempts at sobriety, I'm afraid that despite his recently crossed boundaries that he will be allowed to continue his ways.

8ccvg6,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8ccvg6/the_healthiest_addict/,2,https://redd.it/8ccvg6,nassaucoliseum,The Healthiest Addict,"My cousin's memorial service was today. It wasn't a funeral, no church or casket, it was held at an Audubon Society, with far more people than chairs. We were told to dress casually, and not nearly enough people took that seriously. I'm a bit of a hip, preppy sort anyway so I wore a Yankee hat with some skinny pants and a shirt I stole from my brother.

He liked the Yankees a lot. We're from a family almost entirely concentrated in Massachusetts, so he was one of few.

A friend of his spoke, talking about the courage of banality, of waking up every morning and getting shit done, of doing what you need to or feel obligated to, and how much that can wear you down over time. How much sobriety seems pointless and numbing and is just getting up to do the same old shit every day, the kind of capitalist ethics of this bravery in facing what one has committed to and what commitment takes out of you in late capitalist life, talking about the urge to get high and the way that it is, at the very least, something. It feels like something. It *is* something.

I remember his step-father referencing it before the service, and a nod to it in his mother's thoughts: the idea that he was the healthiest addict anyone had met, a nod to the way that he was an avid bike rider for a great portion of his life, even when using. He loved accomplishing and completing not in a sense of mere economic structures but in seeing things through, in creating better means for others to find a proper orientation and ideation of themselves, how he loved getting dirt under his fingernails and loved traveling across the country.

When they invited anyone who felt so compelled to speak, I found myself up there. I've been good at schmoozing, speaking in public and private, and most of all the art of extemporaneous speaking for quite some time. I don't remember that much of my speech apart from how much everyone seemed to like it, and I wish that were from some bars rather than a bout of depression-induced dissociation. 

We know it was heroin, but I still don't know how it happened, and considering some of the ways my dad and his talked about opiate use and how it should be opposed or controlled or dealt with in the panopticon gaze of contemporary law, I think I want to let it be a bit of a mystery. I can imagine it well enough anyway: he relapses enough to feel like he has a tolerance again, draws up a shot or two, is barely feeling the first when the second throws him a hot spot. Or maybe his relapse was just with some real good shit and he should've been sniffing it first. Whatever it was, it's a bit late for harm reduction. 

I feel hurt, empty, but what's worse is that I feel like using. I haven't had heroin in over a year, and I have been sober since I got into some shit back in January, since living at home is a drag. Before that I was showing that banal courage, that ability to drag myself out of bed every day for another shot at sobriety, for a whole year. When I hear all of these people talking about not trying it, about how it ruins people like him, I can't help but feel like I know it too well to ever forget. 

Can't unring that bell. 

I wish my bell were ringing, I wish I had a bundle or a g of some raw, I wish I had some white girl and some bars to go with it, I feel pathetic for being sad I never got to chase the dragon with him. Life is complicated and messy and good lines are neat and long and fat and will leave you on your ass.

I have this one vein that always hurts and stings like hell when I'm pushing in. It feels like I'm completely missing,  but if I try to register I'm still good. Also, I NEVER have any of the signs you see after a miss. It's on my wrist/hand, so you could hide the typical lump you get after a miss. Also, it hits me as quick as a normal hit would. 

I know that you're probably thinking that I hit an artery, but its definitely not an artery. 

1st. It's a very very dark red color. Not the bright red from an artery. 

2nd. It doesn't hurt at all to puncture the vein like a artery does. It's only when I'm pushing the plunger and the quicker I push the more it hurts.

3rd. When I register, the flow is the typical flow. I've always heard that an artery actually will push the plunger back from all the pressure. 

4th. The blood isn't frothy like artery blood is.

5th I can hit this vein in other area with no pain.


My only guess is that the vein is right next to a nerve and when I push in the plunger the vein can't move the dope quick enough and causes the vein to bulge and put pressure on the nerve. The pain feels a lot like nerve pain in that it burns very bad and I feel it up my arm.",1523748316.0

I consider any cash found in a random parking lot, on the ground, to be pretty fucking cool. Have any of you found any money just chillin on the ground before? 

P. S- I also hope you all are having an awesome Saturday night! Hopefully your high and enjoying yourself. And if you're not, and you're sick, hopefully it doesn't last too long and you get well soon. Unless you're clean and not using. Then I hope you stay strong and continue staying clean.

The bags contained crushed pearls and no heroin. I sent it to a lab to be tested to see if it had any heroin. It contained no heroin in the results and they couldn't identify what it was.

I feel something for sure, but I know what oxy feels like, this is not that feeling. It’s more like a head and body lightness than that familiar euphoric warmth.

Although, my pupils are pretty pinned..

So, I’m curious as to what you guys think?

Fakes or are these pills just old or something?

Also, if they’re fakes is there any cause for concern? It’s been almost 3 hrs since my initial dose, would I know by now if I needed to be worried?

Another thing, tbh I’ve never had an oxy 30, I usually get hydrocodone 10’s. Is the experience any different?

I've been using opiates for 5 or so years, heroin for 2, but only started IV-ing a little over a month ago. My heroin use increased a lot since codeine became prescription only on 1 Feb. Before that I was mostly a codeine addict, and would get H when I could afford it. I was also unemployed up until 5 weeks ago so now I can afford all the H I want (except I'm currently in withdrawal because I lost my bitcoin cash deposit to a certain DNM and still haven't got my coins back).

There was no fent or anything in this dope, I just had too much. I got careless. I had too many times where I had too small a dose and had to make another shot, and I only have one vein I can usually get to, and only get 5 needles at once. I should have invested in good quality mg scales or at least used the crappy one I have. Other than that I was careful and sterile with everything.

The amount I dissolved was in one solid rock so it looked like much less than it was and I actually thought it wouldn't be enough.

I hide my usage from my boyfriend and housemates. I like to shoot up in the shower/bath (it's a showerhead over a bathtub). It's a nice place to do it, it's private, and I tend to bleed so being able to rinse it away right away helps. 

I didn't fill up the tub this time, I just turned the shower on so I could feel the warm water running down my back. I was excited that I got a vein so easily and injected it all at once. Usually I would titrate the dose, which means I don't get the same rush I could, but I'm less likely to die. This time I felt it, the rush. But I knew, as soon as I felt it, that I'd had too much. I had that feeling of losing control. I told myself ""it's okay, I'm still conscious, everything is fine"". I managed to take the needle out of my arm but didn't manage to put the needle cap back on. The next thing I remember was hearing my boyfriend calling my name from outside. I didn't know what was going on. I know that for a second I felt annoyed at being woken from such a peaceful slumber, even though I had no idea why I was lying asleep in the bathtub. 

Once I realised where I was and what was happening, I got up as quickly as possible and turned off the shower. I responded to his calls asking what was wrong. He was saying there was water leaking out into the hall. I was so confused because the bath was empty and the bathroom floor was completely dry. But my main concern was getting rid of all the evidence of my shooting up. I found the needle, couldn't find the needle cap so put it in a sharps container, and I quickly shoved everything else into a bag. 

I then got out of the bath and tried to find out what was going on. I was so fucked up, but luckily no one could tell. My housemate came into the bathroom and saw that the bath faucet had completely caved in, leaving a hole in the wall. I must have been lying there unconscious for 1 or 2 hours, after falling backwards and causing the hole in the wall, with the water running, which explains how it leaked into the hall.

At first I didn't even understand that I'd overdosed because of course I couldn't remember being unconscious. And I didn't understand how the faucet had broken because I didn't remember falling (I must have fallen after I became unconscious - which would make sense), and I was still so fucked up I couldn't feel the pain in my back. I remember staring at the broken faucet trying to understand, and I could barely even see because heroin affects my vision so much. 

I was in no state to do anything at that point. I stayed in the bathroom and got dressed but I got back into the bath. I wanted to make sure there was no more evidence. Plus the bath seemed like the safest place to be since I was barely functioning. I still hadn't found the orange needle cap, that last piece of evidence. Then I was pretty sure I saw it go down the drain and for some reason thought it was possible and necessary to get it out of there. I thought the plumber would find it and say ""here's what caused the issue"". At that point I still didn't understand what had happened. And my understanding of basic plumbing was missing because I was looking for the needle cap in the hole in the wall, amongst the broken tiles, after failing to get it out of the drain (it was properly down the drain). There was no way the plumber would come to fix a faucet and replace some tiles and find something that had fallen down the drain, but it took me a while to figure that out.

Eventually I decided sitting in the bath any longer would just seem even more suspicious, so I got out and helped soak up the water in the hall. I said I would get a plumber to fix the faucet. For some reason no one questioned how it broke.

I only pieced it all together later when I saw the bruises (and felt the pain) on my back, remembered the initial rush and feeling like I was losing control, and had vague memories of a peaceful dreamlike state while lying in the bath.",1523713909.0

During that time I learned a few, legal, tricks and loopholes. For those of you who have state funded insurance it’s a little harder to do but still possible. Say you have a prescription that has like a $500 copay because America is fucked. Go on that drugs website and search ‘savings card’. You’ll most likely have to enter an email or a phone number. In doing so you’ll receive some numbers that can be used in place of your state insurance card. They look like this 

ID Number - 123456789 (sometimes up to 3 letters in the beginning)
BIN Number - 123456
Rx Group - ABCDEF
PCN Number - 1234

Now keep in mind, if you have state insurance it will not work in conjunction with that insurance. However, with that being said, nine times out of ten the ‘savings card’ is cheaper than what the state is willing to pay. Sometimes pharmacies will be dicks and if they already have your state insurance on file, they won’t even apply the card for you by itself. Go to a different place and use just the savings card. 

If you have private insurance, you’re in luck. You will be able to use both your insurance as well as the ‘savings card’ to drop your copay even lower. 

I have had copays drop hundreds of dollars by doing this for customers. One time that sticks out is a women coming in just looking completely fucking defeated. Her husband was not taking his psych meds because they could no longer afford the full month, so they’d get as many as the insurance allowed a month. Which was NOT enough. I was able to get her a full months supply with an extremely low copay. Use this advice for your scripts people. I can’t guarantee that it’ll work on opiates, but it does on most (not all) meds, especially name brands. Be good to each other and stay safe.

Whats your thoughts?,"First off I never did this I only remember reading about it a while back so the details are a little fuzzy...

Basically, if I remember correctly it went a little something like this; someone in the US on government-sponsored healthcare goes to a lenient doctor (not pill mill) and is prescribed a prescription for opiates they don't *need* or they are over-prescribed. Then for much much less than street costs or online pharmacy costs which can now exceed $1 a mg... but either part of or the entire months supply from said person. The story I recall, someone purchased the entire prescription, a supply of **120** 30mg Roxycodone, for somewhere between $250-$300.

Like I said, I have never done this and it is unlikely I would ever even have the opportunity to - but shit if I could I would do it in a heart beat. Thats less than 1/10th the street price. This has to be by far the cheapest way to get real pharmacy oxy without getting your name put into the state database avoiding some of the unfortunate consequences that come along with that.

So what are your thoughts? Has anyone ever heard an easier way to get roxy this cheap with as comporable risk or less? Share your story if you'd like.",1523694646.0

- hot compress after each shot, even if it’s not a miss, to allow blood to flow and prevent bruising/swelling.
- shower at least 1x daily to renew and resurface skin. Clean skin is regenerating skin. Tracks seem to appear darker when you haven’t showered for 2 days and they’re purple and scabbed.
- exercise. Obvious one.
- hydration and daily vitamin
- **new works every single time. Knowing the proper way to IV and how to sanitize.**
- Wash your hands. Sanitize the area with an antiseptic foam or spray, alcohol pad. New cotton. Toss stick in sharps.

well my weed dealer is also a guy who is in a lot of pain and shit and he also happens to sell opiates. just tylenol w/ codeine (t3s), hydromorph 30s and dilly 8mgs. sometimes I get a hydro 30 but they cost $50 and make me super irritable and they don't come close to how fun snorting the dillies are. and how nice I fucking feel right now 

I heard pluggings even better. my guy lets me put shit on my ""bill"" and it's already at $200 (these canadian prices) so i told him to stop it at that no more until i pay him on tues.

i can maybe see this kinda getting outta hand because i feel like right now i'm fully appreciating the opiate high that is obtainable from these little pills. and it feels damn good. Methadone was very nice too the one time hehad it. I've tried heroin twice but each time got sicker than fuck so it doesn't really appeal to me (maybe too high of a dose?) but these DIlly 8mgs make me super talkative and give me a very very very nice energy boost and damn. just ndamn.

I say I'm sick so I can leave work (which I really shouldn't have), then I pull up outside BC's house and he gets in my car and says we gotta wait for the guy to get there. The guy gets there and BC gets in and gets out and comes back in my car- he says he gave my $ to him and he's going to CVS to grab the script. After sitting in my car a whole hour, a friend shows up to give BC $ that he owes him.  He gets back in my car. I keep asking him to text the guy but he says he won't answer his phone. I can't tell who he's texting. His phone is dying so he runs inside to grab his charger. After a bit, I notice BC is nodding out. He says it's his xanax. Bullshit. I see a text on his phone when he's nodded out that says ""90 for black"" so I'm like, yep. He stole my $ and bought himself some H. I stubbornly refuse to leave. We sat in my car for a total of almost 2 and a 1/2 hours before I couldn't stand it anymore. His bullshit.  

Worst of all is right after I leave, I text my main connect hoping refill day is Monday as it should be (he had a heart attack last weekend but is OK and home now- they put stents in.) He pretty much eludes to him not getting his monthly Oxy script anymore by texting, ""I'm not planning for anything right now"" and when I ask him to call to explain he refuses, says maybe later and, ""Just not going to stress out because you are I can't do that any more you have to relax."" I asked, ""you can't do what anymore?"" And he said, ""stress"".  I mean, I do stress when refill day is later than it should be but he didn't even tell me a day! Do they not give opiates to people after heart attack?? He's been getting them for a decade! 

I'm terrified he's not going to get his script anymore. And that I am so fucked. I only know him and that asshole BC. My heart is pounding out of my chest. I'm so sick and another fucking blizzard is hitting this weekend and I feel like I can't breathe.  I could barely drive home after he sent those texts to me.  I haven't been in real withdrawal (with NOTHING) for more than a day in many years. I'm terrified.

my addiction  began with tramadol, we all know the deal,, strange chemical but can be fun and it’s  all over the UK because all we get is trams and codeine derivatives. Gps here shit their pants even trying to get valium - pussy Nhs dicks

Then i moves to dihydrocodeine and codeine phosphate - DHC was superior, phosphate more pure as it’s straight to morphine - but lasts 3 hours and ceiling seemed to be 450mg or so

DHC, 240mg + was a good dose and redoes no probs, americans arents exp with DHC i know, it feels like heroin but weaker obv, 400mg will nod your balls off. 

1 dhc
2 tramadol 
3 codeine 

lastly, i finally tries oxy, and it was garbage to me.
I would eat 20mg and snort 5mg lines until i got wherever and it was just stimulating and just buzzy and euphoric - it’s for ppl who wanna get shit done on opiates - i want the nod and not move - for the price, suuuuch a let down man

i would progress to eating a full 40mg and snort up to 20mg... nah fuck them
and their price. Oxy for me the most overrated opiate known in this world.

drugs i feel are amazing i’ve never tried (bear in mind i never shoot up so maybe oxy shot is amazing)

I’ve been using ECP heroin for a few years off and on and my ROA has been IV for almost exactly a year now and I’ve never had this happen before. This dope I’ve been getting lately, every time I shoot it during the rush my heart starts POUNDING really hard and really fast, and my hands are uncontrollably shaking. It happens every time and lasts for about a minute or two. Otherwise it feels like regular dope, I’m not really wired or anything like I would be on an upper. I’ve shot meth before and never had my heart beating or the shaking like that either but I’ve never shot any other uppers so can’t really compare it...

And as an aside I did ask my dboy about it but he’s not the one bagging, he said he’s trying to find out what it’s cut with from the dude he gets it from though.

So I guess my questions are: has anyone experienced this before? And does anyone have any idea what it could be cut with? And/or is it a bad idea to keep using this particular batch? Thanks in advance to anyone who can help me out",1523663307.0

I’m 25, still live at home even though I have a degree, lost two jobs now in a month, have 0 motivation when it comes to job hunting, have no idea what I want to do for work, don’t see the point of waking up in the morning and have nothing to look forward to except for opiates but I have no connects, and I’m going insane with boredom.

A woman walked passed my car and yelled to a gentleman sitting on his steps. This superman of guy was ready and had a narcan kit within reach, being a recovering addict himself. It took all the doses he had due to my size and amount I used. 

Waking up after being dead was such a weird feeling, almost fake. I can't believe I am alive in all seriousness. I owe everything to that man who just happened to be there.

Long story short my buddy said he would take me to the spot if I paid the Uber, so we get there and everyone is sold out. Now he is pissed because he has to get back to work, half an hour before I do. He gives me his money and gives me his plugs info. This guy Is my coworkers husband, honestly one of the nicest guys I’ve met in a long time. He’s a decent bit older then her but hey they have a kid and seem really happy so who am I to judge. 

Anyways I made sure it was cool if I hit her up when I wasn’t with him and he said that was fine because he can’t always get stuff for me with his schedule. Dude has never charged me a fee to middle and has fronted his money to pick up from his people and deliver to me at work before. 

So this particular blue plug is this black chick that gets to me at the bp I’m waiting at she honestly was cute as fuck too, but I would have said fuck it and gone back to work since it was getting late but my buddy was covering for me on lunch and my boss wasn’t there. 

She gives me three blues for 85 which was cool, and they were mbox 30mg. They were suuuuper light colored blue like so light they almost looked white. They were a smidgeon scuffed up but I assumed they were handled. 

I went to the bathroom and railed one after my Uber dropped me back at work, crushed up on a bill and to my surprise they were softer then the pink 10 k’s that I had been getting from the pharmacy (which are my personal favorite), they still required some pressure to crush but they crushed easier then any other blues I’ve had. They tasted right lovely drip and provided a nice euphoric oxy buzz. Talkative a little energetic.l, but not as amped as really energizing Kratom can be. 

Now when I get home from work I load up 1 full one and the bigger half from breaking a second and load it up for a shot. There was veeerry little residual left in the spoon and the water was very light blue. And there was a veeery nice rush that I got that I was not expecting, because I have shot a 218s and as that aren’t 30s too, the rush I remembered was not nearly as good.

 I’m not sure if my tolerance was fucked at the time from banging d’s and h and it just didn’t touch it, but I have been doing heroin and d’s and any anything I can get my hands on lately, and I’m pretty much back where I was at back then. 

It was a pretty strong rush that was better then the shitty heroin I got from my other middle on Tuesday. I was mad I wasted my money on that short lasting fenty trash so I decided to get blues because I could afford a few and i knew that the 3 over a couple hours would get me a euphoric high as opposed to getting fent bullshit again. 

Now my question is do the m boxes I got sound like sniffing and shooting experiences you all have had with them as well? The softness and intensity of the rush was indicative of something like fent but the high was all oxy. Very euphoric not sedating. I did nod out a little bit smoking the last half, but it even tasted right. Are the mboxes this magical normally or do you think I got fakes? They didn’t seem to be pressed with fent, unless it was some strange fentalogue. I’m tempted to send a piece of one to a testing lab to see what’s in them, if it’s some type of new research chemical or maybe it’s heroin that’s pressed into blues. But the good heroin I’ve done lately felt different then that rush, I’ve never had anything quite like it. Fuck me I realized I had 92 left in my bank account just now too, but the banks closed and I don’t have my card, should be coming in the mail soon. I want to get three and load them all into the same shot, 45 Mg shot was amazing I think a 90mg shot would be orgasmic. I almost liked it more then diluadid...",1523660486.0

Our thoughts really do seem to create a reality.

I've been living in such a negative frame of mind lately and it seems to just make everything worse! 
(Well I mean I guess duh lol) 

But seriously though, so much of this is mental: 
Like how we will be withdrawing our balls off, in such a shitty head space and yet once we have the relief in our hands it's like the symptoms seemingly disappear.

Or like how when you know you'll get to score soon. Or even worse when you know you can't score again.

For me it's like I never feel the ""last bag"" if I don't know when the next ""fix"" is.

Or how the week prior to rehab I could not feel high for the life of me because I was too damn stressed about the pending mental and physical doom of detox.

So that being said I'm really trying to use this principle to be more positive and make sobriety a tiny teeny bit easier.

Idk it's hard as fuck. Obviously these drugs fuck with our chemical makeup and how we think and react. 
Yet yesterday I had this moment where I just genuinely wanted nothing to do with dope or getting high. I did the bare minimum amount to stay well and usually this is hard af for me because I am so use to obsessing over my use and feeling normal. 

But again yesterday my head was above water all day. I wasn't necessarily positive but I wasn't dwelling in negative either. It was bearable.
I keep busy and just was so turned off by the idea of getting high. It's like my brain finally has made a connection that getting High and continuing to use= pain and misery.

Bleh. 

Just random thoughts from my mind. 

(Side note- yesterday my power got shut off and I have $70 to my name for 4 days..normally I'd be going APE SHIT. my mind would produce nothing but negative thoughts. Thus making it a million times harder to get through a day.
Yet idk, I was ok. I think for the first time in awhile I had a bit of a hold on my mental state.

I ran out early last month and landed myself right in the heat of withdrawal when my dad visited from 18 hours away. He drove 18 hours to spend 3 days with me, drunk and withdrawing, and I completely ruined our visit. 

I had good intentions to do better with this refill. I have a 7 day pill box. I cut them into halves and set out my weeks worth. 

Then that weeks worth ran out and I kept dipping. I'm right back up to a dosage that's triple my prescribed daily amount. The worst part of this refill is my doc cut a pill a day so I am already working with 30 less than normal. 

I still have half my script left but Idk how long that will last. The kicker is I'm not even enjoying them. Usually I'm active and energetic when I take my oxy but I had the flu 2 weeks ago and my body has just changed. I've slept all day every day this week. I feel stupid and sick on them. Why do I keep redosing? 

I can't let myself sit here and go through wd this weekend cause that would seriously suck for my family, but come Monday, I'll have all day all week to deal with the effects. 

If I can stick to my dosing schedule I'll have at least 40 left on Monday. Even if I go to the excess I'll still have a weeks worth left of my script. I think it will help the wd knowing I'm sitting on pills. I won't feel so desperate. I can start taking then the week before my refill.

I experienced slight neck tension, tingles in my left arm and hand that comes and goes, and I have felt a palpitation here and there which rockets my anxiety up. I am awake, conscious, not exactly labored breathing but not breathing normally either, feel mildly nauseous, and yeah I didn't do too much either - the euphoria is mediocre, the painkilling effects are generally working, but this is unlike my last experience with #4 heroin.

I feel good on one hand but embarrassed and scared on the other. We aren’t super close, probably why I even admitted it to him— I could never willingly admit this to my close friends/family because I don’t want to hurt them.

Im currently focusing on Oxycodone if that makes any difference.

Firstly, anything that will potentiate Oxycodone so that a lower dose is required.

Secondly, drug combinations (such as benzos) that add to the experience. 

I really value the opinion of this community and the knowledge that lies within. This is why I am asking opinions over just browsing potentiator forums. 

Just as a side note, I am aware of the potential pitfalls (over and above drug use for recreational purposes) so there is no need to be conservative.

8bwyvt,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8bwyvt/opinions_needed_to_settle_a_dispute_whos_better/,28,https://redd.it/8bwyvt,kloudykat,Opinions needed to settle a dispute: who's better- Me vs. my girl,"Ok- requesting my fellow H users (both casual and habitual) to weigh in on an ""argument"" between my girl and I on who's contribution to satisfying our opiate needs is worth more-

Background: we are habitual users with a daily habit of anywhere from a half to a whole G on a typical day (and we snort it). Anything we get we split down the middle. We take turns buying it for the day but it isn't quite 50/50, I buy more than she does, and usually get a greater amount than she does when she's the one purchasing. Because of this I feel that I'm doing more to support our habit than she does. 

But here's the argument: I'm currently (and newly) unemployed but I receive a pretty decent inheritance check every 2 weeks and I'm the sole buyer for us until that money we budgeted for our habit is gone(typically anywhere from 5-8 days), at which point she takes over until the next check comes. 

She is also unemployed but doesn't receive a check like me, so shes always finding new and exciting ways to generate money (and no, she doesn't trick or Rob people for it in any capacity).

Her most recent hustle, and probably the most clever IMO, was approaching people and asking if they can help her with a bachelorette party scavenger hunt that she has until Saturday to complete (today is Thursday). One of the tasks is that she has to get a minimum of $50 in donations from strangers (from any multitude of ppl, she isn't  asking 1 person to donate $50 themselves) . 

To further legitimize her ruse so as not to appear like a scam she tells the ""donator"" that she has to get a pic with them and the $ and have them initial her scavanger hunt paper to ""prove she isn't cheating"" by using her own money to accomplish this task. Pretty scandalous and quite clever right?

Anyway obviously her way takes a lot more effort than simply getting a check, but her way also generates less funds and takes a lot longer than my way. It took about 3-4 hours to come up with $60, which is really the bare minimum amount we need to get enough for us to split and be Ok for the day. 

She says that even though were typically only getting enough to get by  when she's the one buying that her contribution is actually worth more than mine bc of the amount of time/energy, and thought that goes in to her plans. 

I disagree. 

So we are giving the argument to you good people to decide once and for all who's doing more for our habit- my greater amounts with almost no effort, or her smaller but acceptable bags for us to split.

TLDR: I spend more money on H for us to split 50/50 than she does with little to no effort via a bi-weekly inheritance check/ once that $ is gone she takes over and buys smaller bags but with great effort and time consuming plays. Who's making the greater contribution to our needs?


Addt'l info on her scavanger hunt play: to try to encourage people to ""donate"" more $ for the game she says that all the money generated is going towards the honeymoon for the fictitious couple and that whomever comes up with the most money by the hunts and will receive a call bonus and a day spa certificate and whomever had the largest single person donation will also receive a cash prize.


I've included pictures of the pretend scavanger hunt rules and tasks she created at her request to show the people she's asking for donations from so you can see how much effort she put in to this plan.",1523599116.0

I’ve been on 16mg of Suboxone (the white half moons + 155) daily for the past 9 months, and to be honest, I’m sick and tired of all the doctor appointments, making up reasons why I need a certain time of day off of work, telling friends and family that I see a psychiatrist when it’s really a Suboxone clinic... I just want off the Suboxone.

I’ve read some really conflicting information on what it’s like coming off of Suboxone; some say it’s the worst opioid withdrawal I’ll ever experience, and some say it’s quite easy. Before I got on Suboxone, I was physically dependent on oxymorphone. If I couldn’t get my hands on that, it was oxycodone. Always something, every single day just to not be sick.

Has anyone ever came off of Suboxone on their own, without the ridiculous “3-4 year weaning” process these Suboxone doctors put people on? I wouldn’t want to just up and quit cold turkey, but what do you all think it would be like after 9 months or so of two 8mg tablets a day? How fast could I wean myself down to nothing? Will it be agonizing?

I've been snorting pills/heroin for the last 7 years. The past 2 years have been strictly h and between. 5 and a gram a day. I switched to the needle 2 months ago because my breathing had gotten so bad that I couldn't walk up stairs without being out of breath. Also, I got tired of living with the ""death rattle "" at nights for the past year. I used to use a netti pot fairly regular, but was always shocked that NOTHING ever came out.

Fast forward to now...

I have a major sinus infection and I'm blowing ridiculous amounts of stuff out of my nose. However, what has me concerned is seeing a thin rubber like membrane that I'm also blowing out in small pieces. (Since its coming out of my nose, its actually pretty big). They best description would be a rubbery thin film thats the thickness of a condom and you have to actually tear apart to break up.

I'm assuming that what this is, is my sinuses had gotten a coating of drugs that over time had formed a rubbery film? If this is the case, it would explain why A. I never got anything out after using the netti pot... and B. Why my lungs had gotten so bad so quick. My sinuses no longer were absorbing anything because it basically had something similar to a condom that was covering everything that the dope would have normally attached to?

My questions are this...

1st. Has anyone else experienced this?

2nd. Does my theory seem plausible?

3rd. Any idea how to get rid of this? The only time I ever get this stuff out is when I have a sinus infection. The last SI mainly had this film coming out of the right nostril and now, it's the left nostril. (I'm getting regular heavy mucus out of the other nostril).

4th. Can you think of any other possible reason/thing this is? 

I'd love to go to the doctor, but I've basically bankrupted my family and I don't have insurance. So unfortunately, seeing a doctor is out of the question unless this becomes serious. ",1523595242.0

Anyway, she charged $10 for the 18's which is a great price for oxy  imho. Well when she got upgraded to the 27's she left the price the same - $10 for basically 30mg of oxy. IMHO you gotta be a fucking idiot to turn that down but fuck if I can get anyone interested in them.

I've been on Vivitrol for about 14 days and its pretty terrible stuff IMO. INSANE insomnia and a strange kind of crippling depression and agoraphobia-ish type anxiety i never had before, along with other more minor physical symptoms. (Pain and stomach issues.)

Because I can't handle this shit, I've been trying to research a way to break through that infernal shot, to little avail. Been reading about how Suboxone/bupe can bypass it, so naturally i acquired some and insufflated 4mg.

I was quite underwhelmed, and though i doubt it was placebo for various reasons, I did manage to feel a teeny bit less anhedonic (i can actually talk without a flat affect, and leave my house--seriously.. I wish the psychiatrist would've warned me about these issues (i did ask), but the way he presented it, Vivitrol is as harmless as chamomile tea.)

Digging online reveals that most people who have success breaking through vivitrol do so by IVing the bupe/Suboxone..usually in like 1-2mg amounts.

I only have Suboxone (no subutex) so I'm a little wary of risking putting myself through PWD (considering the naloxone) though is that even really an issue when you get down to the fundamental pharmacokinetics?

Shouldn't the residual naltrexone perhaps block the naloxone? I know for me, bupe itself doesn't block naloxone like it does for many folks who IV Suboxone. (I had a bad experience IVing it some years ago, so first hand experience in that regard.) Really tempted to try it though, as pathetic and desperate as that may sound.

Also I've seen tramadol mentioned but much less info seems available on that. I'd appreciate it if anyone has any information on that, or anything else that would displace the damn naltrexone on my mu-opioid happy spots.

Are there any other methods to screw with the injection itself, apart from cutting oneself open? Like some kind of way to metabolize the gel release thing faster than usual, perhaps some kind of ass cheek exercises combined with grape fruit juice and hydroxycut? (I joke.)

But seriously, is there any way to nullify this thing? You'd think they'd (the drug company) create a way to reverse the shot in case of emergency adverse symptoms.

Please, any tips or anecdotes please! I am desperate .",1523570735.0

We’ve gone hunting a few times together, played pool, he’s chilled at my place and vice versa. He’s on pain management, relative of a really good friend. He likes to play games sometimes.... “I’ll be good at 2pm tomorrow “. You call at 1:00, no answer. 3 days later you get a text... “are you coming to grab these or what?” Than he bitches you out for not being there at 2pm.

Today is day 7 of waiting for what I needed 7 days ago, his uncle has been sick and actually passed yesterday. “He will call me when it’s good, don’t call him”. Sad part is, his uncle really is sick and I assume did pass away. I did the dt’s already, took my normal kratom daily.

I have only tried cold-medicine with codeine before, around 100mg 3 times, and it was fairly enjoyable. I have also been addicted to alcohol for the past 2 years (not very heavy use but still every day).


Therefore, i bought 5 30mg IR oxycodone a couple of months back from a guy with a script, but I have been unsure whether I want to go down this road or not. In my mind I would use occasionally for as long as I could until I ran out of money, in which case I would end it (unless doing opiates changed my outlook on life).


In the best case scenario, I would be able to use opiates for a while, possibly become addicted and maybe have some sort of revelation about life. In this scenario, finding a purpose in life would far outweigh the negative effects of addiction, as I would be alive instead of dead (since most normal people hold life above all others, it wouldnt matter if i were addicted as long as i was alive)


In the worst case scenario, I would use opiates, fall in love with them and become addicted, run out of money, and then still not have the courage to off myself, and I would be stuck in a ""mental prison"" which according to what I've read here for the past 3 years is 1000x worse than regular depression.

The dog did his walk around hopping on the Windows and sniffing and such and a little bark here and there but not where anything was hidden. They then proceeded to ask where the drugs were cause of the way the dog was acting. Of course we said no, they half ass patted us down and sent us on our way. Can anyone confirm?",1523552846.0

Well when my actual dude came through he threw a cig pack in my car when I handed him the money and then split fast. By time I opened it and checked it I realized that the stuff was completely bunk and not psychoactive at all. Which sucked, because the same dude hooked me up with some fire the day before.

So, how can you tell what your current tolerance is and if you can safely redose.

Say for example; I take 40mg of OC at 2pm (crushed/parachuted) Then at 3pm I snort another 20mg. Then 3.30pm, another 20mg dose. 

Say then at 4.30pm I'm feeling high but would like to be higher. How do I know what a safe amount would be to take. I've never had a problem and my doses have probably maxed at 160mg throughout the day. 

The only guide I go by is obviously if I'm feeling good but also measure heart rate. If that drops below 60bpm, I tend to slow it down. Is the dose response curve fairly wide if you are resonably experienced?

Once every few weeks to once every couple months. I decided to buy some kratom from my local head shop. Honestly it's really boring to me. A couple grams gives me a mood boost for the rest of the day. 7-12g very very very slightly relaxes me and makes me kinda talkative. No euphoria though. Feels like it wants to be an opiate but obviously isn't lol. Anyways I noticed something. I took about 3g in the morning (noon is my morning time) and went about my day. Hadn't used opiates in a month or two. I got ahold of a nice 30mg of hydrocodone my usual dose. Ate it with a semifull stomach.

I'm going to take a couple weeks break and try it with kratom again. I was just wondering if anybody else has had this experience or can confirm this happens.

While oxy is way better for my money as I'm taking 15mg-20mg for a similar if not cheaper price than the hydrocodone and getting the old euphoria I was missing, I'm getting no nod at all. The nod and euphoria really went amazing together. I don't want to take a whole 30 and get nauseous just to attempt to nod. Is there anything you guys recommend for me to get a nod? Will like .5mg - 1mg of xanax do it for me? I take about 3mg-4mg to get high on xanax and that's a pretty weak one to me. With no tolerance I can't feel a bar so .5mg to 1mg is like nothing to me.

Can you go ahead and take suboxone the next day and keep on with your maintenance or do you have to wait until withdrawal to start sub again even though you never felt the opiates and they were never able to bind to your receptors? 

I was under the impression suboxone wipes all the opiates out of your system, and unless you wait long enough after your last suboxone (24-72 hours) dose you will not be able to feel anything from opiates.  If that is true then do the opiates that you tried to relapse with even stick to receptors in your body or do they just get flushed out as if you hadn't taken a thing and you ended up just ""wasting"" pain pills?

Lately i made the stupid decision to use again. Thought i could just have a little nostalgic fun with heroin again. I scored 0.1 just for a shot or two, sounded like a good idea at the time. And ive had such great control with my drinking and weed lately i thought id be fine.

Well time flew and 5 days later i was still using, at 0.25g a day. Woke up yesterday morning and felt pretty crappy, by some miracle i woke up with a bit of clarity though; and got rid off all my rigs and called my 'dealer' (who is a friend first and foremost luckily; i only met him after 2 years of clean time, we just go to the gym together) and asked him to stop selling to me; he said he was relieved and was worried i was gonna turn to shit again. Swore he wouldn't no matter what i said.
I can cold cop in open air markets here but the gear is usually awful and even in my peak of addiction id avoid it unless i had to.

Dont take your clean time for granted, i did and nearly fucked it all up. The battle isnt over either but im insistent on staying the fuck away from it. I nearly lost my sobriety from heroin, and in doing so risked everything that's important to me.

Tldr; i fucked up my clean time, used heroin again and luckily came to my senses before it was too late. ",1523512216.0

First regular heroin use: 3 months ago [0.5g snorted 2-4 times a week]).

I had convinced myself I could chip and would be fine. But over the past few weeks ive been withdrawing moderately every single week on off days. So Ive decided to quit and thats where I am now. 48 hours clean and only used once in the last 6 days.

I know I can do this. Im not feeling great but better than day 2 of last weeks withdrawal. Chills, toilet, zero motivation, aches, you know the drill. But given im not feeling horrendous now I know this is physically manageable. **But the psychological element is scaring me.**

I was diagnosed with a dissociative anxiety disorder in Jan 2017 and spent 6 months recovering from a deep hole i didnt ever think anyone could reach (this compared to that is nothing). I discovered opiates late last year and here I am now. Reading about PAWS and depression/anxiety after getting clean is frightening. Feelings of having thrown my hours upon hours of mental health work down the pisser, etc. I know im not in the same place as early 2017. Ive grown and gained immense insight into psychology and proper mental hygiene, things that wont be taken away by my recent use, but I cant help shake the feeling I've really fucked up. My self confidence and image is pretty poor and I feel pretty filthy.

Idk, I guess im looking to share my feelings with you guys who know the context well. Maybe get some reinforcement or encouragement. I know im doing the right thing but its hard not to hate myself for these indulgences and the potential post-acute effect they may have.",1523507393.0

We don't always know what syringe will be best for what drug, so please don't get upset with us or think we are being judgemental just because we don't  know the best way to IV heroin into your neck or femoral. We love getting suggestions on how we can better serve the community, so please don't be shy :).

Lastly. If you don't have a job/career, have daily responsibility, no bills or on welfare or any kind of social situation where if u wanted to you could sleep in your living room for weeks at a time doing nothing and nothing will go south in your life, you have NO EXCUSE to not quit if that is what u want to truly do. You KNOW how to do it, but put saftey valves in place to allow urself to give in. Turn your phone off. Keep it off. Deal with the withdrawals , don't check your Facebook, don't allow anyway to contact or someone to contact u regarding using. Give your  laptop to someone or do whatever it takes to separate yourself from the people that will be your rope when your sick as a dog, depressed, and worst of all, beginning to let the user part of your brain plan a justified relapse. If you relapse out of just withdrawl , you need to get some professional help , as you don't want to quit, at least not enough to do it unsupervised.

My post on here helped me realize how much I was enabling him, and shortly after I gave him a 60-day notice to move out. I also did a walk through of the house (with our mom, who had been deep in denial). There were syringes everywhere and it was pretty traumatic to see how bad things were.

Anyway, the move out date (March 30) came and went. I didn't file an eviction because he did open up to our mom about his heroin use and said he wanted to get help. He went in for an evaluation and got state-funded insurance. He supposedly detoxed on his own at home and will be starting outpatient treatment. 

While there has been some progress, I am concerned he is not really serious about treatment and not totally convinced he is clean. He still refuses to respond to my text messages or calls, has not attended any meetings, and declined inpatient treatment even though he is eligible for it. He seems more concerned about people finding out about his addiction than working on his sobriety. 

I never thought I would file an eviction for my brother, but it's starting to look like it might be my only option. Any advice? ",1523484656.0

If you shoot up in a public bathroom, clean your shit please.","So I work in a chain drug store. The area around here is really rampant with heroin and other opiates since it's one of the more pure areas in the country and its pretty cheap.

I live in a bit smaller of a town, but I work in a pharmacy. We sell syringes to those who ask, and I don't have a problem because I am an ex-user or all different drugs so I know it's better to give them clean ones than to share or use old ones. THey are gonna do it one way or another, so I sell them.

Anyways, one night some undesirable looking people come back to the pharmacy, ask if there is a bathroom, and I tell them where it is. Immediately I know something is up, especially because at least 2 or more people came in for syringes right after another and that isn't a common occurence.

I go into the bathroom, I can't really do anything but a kid is in the stall, sitting, I hear a zipper and his pants aren't down.. so he clearly aint taking a shit lol. I leave and come back later to inspect the bathroom and I figured I would find some baggie, a syringe or cap or something.

I don't see anything, but then as I am about to leave I look at the toilet seat cover holder and THERES A FUCKING METAL SPOON IN IT!!

Seriously, what the fuck guys?! I've seen people leave cotton, caps, baggies, BUT A FUCKING SPOON? First of all the idiot is burning all of the fillers and bad shit into their solution and putting it in their veins.. but to leave a spoon man? Come on...

So I told my manager, the police were called and they inspected the videos and saw all of the people. They knew who the kids were ( small town), what car they were now in, who they were with and knew that they had drugs on them now. 

So basically, this kid not only disrespected society and other people by leaving his fucking drug spoon in a public bathroom, but ALSO made it that much easier to find him and his friends and bust them.

Good job!

Please... clean up your shit and be courteous to the rest of us, you're just making things worse and causing more trouble for yourself to get caught.

Thank you and be safe all.

Not understanding how it’s My fault that they left their shit there .

Edit 3: I want to make it clear that no one was arrested from this situation . They can’t prove who left it , they already were aware of who these kids were and all the info about them . This is basically a warning for everyone , yeah maybe i should have not mentioned the spoon but if I did this Then there are thousands of more examples just like this , I’m basically trying to tell you all to not do this shit or your running the risk of it happening to you and getting pinched

FINAL EDIT : ** You know what? It is my fault. You guys are right. I completely forgot that those in the middle of addiction don't take any responsibility for themselves and blame every one else for their problems and what happens to them. Never THEIR fault, they have an addiction! It's my fault he left anything there! It's my fault he shooting pills/dope in the bathroom and leaving a ton of residue of a random substance behind for some kid to find.

Anyway, the point, I know it's different for everyone, but what dose made you feel most comfortable? I'm starting off on 30 Mgs tomorrow and I'm scared that won't be immediately enough for me. I smoke a gram of tar a day that is more pure than most heroin around the west coast.  
What would be the conversion in methadone for a gram of really good WC tar?

Oh, I'm really tired, I'm really tired but I'm actually asking for my kitty-cat He has been doing some shady shit in the neighborhood, gay-dog for pay, stealing all the Scooby snacks from neighborhood dogs/cats.

Simply asking because I’m worried about my urine being sent to a lab.
Whenever I take my drug test at my regular probation department, they just dump my pee out and don’t send it to a lab. But I’m worried that if I take a piss test at my TAIP assessment that they will send it to a lab.
I have prescriptions for everything I would test positive for, but I’ve been using dope (which would pop for opiates) but I have a codeine cough syrup prescription which would explain why I tested positive for opiates. But I know for sure if they sent it to a lab that they would see that it was heroin I used instead of codeine. Unless heroin and codeine metabolites show up as the same thing in a lab test?

     It’s 12:35 a.m. as I sit and think back on The thrilling destruction of my mind and body.  A feeling most certainly of the quality and honesty of a lost love.  In these silent hours of the night possibly my one true love.  
     
     I sit Starring at nothing and... but for a moment living the murky past.  The watercolor smudges of cumulative remembrance,  the eternal “rightness” of these life dreams.  Mothers milk warm vignettes of ice cream grinning love, eternal and fundamentally right.   When I Focus hard enough though a snake oil memory fraudulent and poisonous beckons.  Oh but Those blissful floating  hours of mirage nirvana....and yet....

     I know self sabotage.  I became a lie.  Like water I wove myself around every possible outcome making up each answer as the questions formed.  I taught myself to be a mirror.  I am what you want to see.  Blank slate freedom. 

     ...but this was a different freedom. A special kind of Straight jacket limiting.  I was fastened to a singular pivot point wavering only when the phone went unanswered or the money ran out or my lies grew too cancerous to hold back.  For in Shedding honesty, becoming the essential binary, on or off,  the weight of daily expectations was lifted.  I gave up everything that mattered and in return a phantom quickly replaced it, one purpose far more disruptive and consuming than the routine of living.  I became the singularity before the Big Bang.   
Potential energy and limitlessly compressed weight focused and concentrated on escaping itself.  Eventually the unbelievable explosion bright and white hot showed me my true face. And I could have been any stranger in any town.  I was a lie.  Whole and complete.  The amazing nothing.  

The reckless precision and blind devotion of living the same day over and over is something to never forget.  The sirens call is distant though her song will always be a part of me.  As some dead man said ""stare into the abyss and the abyss stares back.""  There is some truth to that but I guess I was able to turn away mostly intact.  My abyss is a self inflicted sickness that I hope to never forget.

I was told that I didn’t need to worry about any police involvement and simply that I needed to vacate the apartment due to my various lease violations. As my girlfriend and I were pulling into our parking lot, since we’re fortunate enough to have a first-floor apartment straight down a sidewalk clearly visible from near the entrance, we saw a police officer walking from what appeared to be our apartment door, and instead of pulling into our clearly labeled parking spot that correlates with our apartment number, we got the hell out of there with the gram we still had with us. Oddly and luckily enough, the last time my computer was in need of repair, I was invited to take it to BestBuy to have it fixed for free on my grandpa’s three-computer repair plan on which he had only registered one computer; and since I never decided to remove the BestBuy sticker with his name on it, my grandparents ended up informing me that they had received a call from the police department asking them if they had recently had a laptop stolen, as they had just come across one with his name on it during the execution of a search warrant, which confirmed my suspicion that I was lied to by my apartment management when he told me I didn’t need to worry about any police involvement and that they had indeed obtained a warrant that quickly. While they left the syringes, spoons, empty prescription bottles not in my name, and lots of other illegal materials, they did decide to confiscate all the foils, my bongs, pipes, about half of my remaining recently prescribed gabapentin out of the bottle (?), my fucking cat and his crate (????!!!!), and ALL MY KRATOM:(. I’ve spent the better part of the last two hours searching high and low for a kratom site that will ship to me ASAP and that takes card instead of just bitcoin bullshit, with no luck whatsoever, which SUCKS seeing as I’ll be in withdrawals soon and don’t know anyone at all irl who uses kratom (or even opiates for that matter) that could help me out with that. Does anyone know how long to expect before they’ll get an arrest warrant, or if they might even decide not to worry about it since they didn’t find any actual possession of narcotics? Does anyone know where my cat might be if he isn’t at the humane society or animal welfare, and if they’ll charge us anything to reclaim him being that he’s microchipped in my girlfriend’s name? Lastly, I was just approved literally two days ago for a new apartment but have only paid the application fees, and the $200 deposit to hold the apartment so it won’t be leased to someone else. All we still have to do is deal with renters insurance and make the pet deposits and can then presumably get our keys and start moving in out stuff and getting it out of the current apartment that we need to vacate by the end of the week. Does anyone think that this eviction will somehow have any effect on the approval status of our applications to the new apartment?

8bfap8,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8bfap8/frustration/,10,https://redd.it/8bfap8,AnnieAznable,Frustration.,"A little back story here - When I was i was in 6th grade, i found out i had kyphosis and scoliosis theough that really awkward (but clearly helpful and effective) test they do in gym class where they look at your spine as you bend. However, the kyphosis and scoliosis was so bad by the time i was diagnosed that a brace or physical therapy was useless. If i didnt get my entire spine, from the base of my neck to my middle back essentially, fused, my spine was going to crush my heart and lungs and slowly kill me. Long story short, got my spinal fusion... only to have the area of the spine that wasnt fused start to curve in WORSE and start crushing my other internal organs. Yet again had to go under the knife to do the entire surgery over again to fuse my entire spine. The second surgery left me with terrible chronic pain - developed fibromyalgia, degenerative disc disease, and severe athritis. 

Needless to say, im in pain management. The doctor who performed my surgeries saw me and gave me whatever pills I needed - vicodin, tramadol, percocet, valium, you name it. But by time Im around 21 years old, he tells me the pain im in makes no sense to him, isnt adding up due to my ""successful"" surgeries, and i dont need to be seen by him any longer. These fucking surgeries made me had to be home schooled in high school for two years because I was in sp much pain I couldnt get myself out of bed most days. I fought to get through my high school years, got through and was able to have a relatively normal college experience, and somehow a pain ridden fucking loser landed my dream job a year out of college. Its a physically demanding job and there is very little if any room for error. But heres the thing - im good at my job and I absolutely love it. Its given me purpose and has brought a new sense of meaning to my life (needless to say im a clinically depressed and anxiety ridden fool. All this shit will do that to a person) and while any other person in my shoes would pick an easier, less taxing on the body job, i cannot and will not do that.

So, Ive been in pain management for going on 3 years now. Started off on butrans patches along with 5mg oxycodone, celebrex, gabapentin, and tizanidine. After two years we got rid of the butrans patch because it just wasnt helping me anymore and i was left with everything else.... and my tolerance for the 5mg oxy is just laughable. When you've been on opioid pain killers since literally 11 years old and are now going on 25... 5mg is nothing at this point, but i know how almost impossible it is to get any sort of assistance or prescription overall from any damn doctor anywhere, whether you have chronic pain or dentist work or cancer or whatever the fuck! So believe me when I say I am lucky to get anything at all. I get 120 pills a month to take 4 times daily, but when youre doubling, tripling what youre supposed to be taking, 120 pills disappear in the blink of an eye. Got my script tomorrow, gabe my mom around 5, gave my roommaten 20 of them to stash and hide for me to dispense out to me when im out, and had at the rest of them. Took far too many to get through just two days of work and took way too many once I got home and could relax... and thats putting it lightly. 

Im frustrated. Im embarrassed. Im scared. Im hopeless.... I just dont even know what to do anymore. I have an appointment with my pain managment doc in aboit 3 weeks. My new insurance plan sucks and wont cover these appointments so im paying $300 out of pocket to get meds that my body has grown a tolerance for and dont do anything for me anymore. 

I guess im posting because i just feel like theres something fucking wrong with me and I feel far too dependent on these damn opioids... im 25 years old and am on the same pill regimen as my 79 year old grandma. I know I need my doses raised, but im terrified to try and address it and because of being so young, im scared of saying or doing any damn thing that would even remotely think of labeling me as a drug adict. But these drugs make it possible for me to work my dream job and have a somewhat normal life with my friends, family, and endeavors plus or minus some things. 

I don't even know what to do. Any advice or even just some positive vibes would be much appreciated. The pain has been so bad today that Ive been popping pills like m&ms, i havent been able to fall asleep and my alarm for work goes off in an hour and a half.

Thanks.",1523432272.0

I always measure out and write down every single dose along with the total at the end of the day. This is every day for the past year. About 10 doses of 20mg per day all tracked. Now I am very much considering switching to IV. My only worry is that I will eventually end up using a lot more than I anticipated and ""falling off the deep end"". But this worry only stems from what I've heard and read from others about switching to IV immediately being the worse decision to make. I do have faith in myself that's its possible. For a person like me, who's been able to use the same amount daily for the past year, is switching to IV and maintaining the same strict use schedule actually realistic and achievable? Or am I fooling myself?

Adam is in his early 50’s. He’s short 5’5 and he’s disgustingly overweight 300+ pounds. He wears glasses cause he’s blind as a bat with his beedy little eyes. He’s a ginger. Has a raspy high pitched whiny voice. So there’s your description of him lol. Now I’ve met some junkies that are pretty fiendlike but Adam is in a whole other category. 

My boyfriend had known Adam from back in the OC days. Adam’s Dad was one of the biggest pill dealers around here. He got prescribed OC’s the real ones and other pills. I think he also got pills off the web idk but I’ve heard a lot about Adam’s Dad and how cool he was. Nobody knows why he is the complete opposite of his dad. Could’ve been cause he’s an only child and he’s spoiled rotten. His dad passed away years ago and left everything to him. He had a construction business that went to shit cause Adam is a lazy fuck. Basically he blew everything that was left to him and fucked off the business. He used to have an apartment but eventually lost that too cause funds ran out. 

I met Adam in 2016 when my boyfriend and I were in rough spot. We had to move out of my house cause it was being raised for floods and we had no car. My cars clutch blew and I couldn’t afford to get it fixed in a shop so a family friend said he would store my car and help fix it when he had free time. My boyfriend totaled his car. It was just a rough time. One day when we were staying at a friends house our friend Trevor came over. Trevor grew up with Adam and were best friends but it was more because their parents were close. Trevor told us Adam would help us do returns and give us a ride and we obliged. 

Anytime we’ve needed someone to do returns for us or whatever we break people off fairly and we aren’t stingy. Adam realized that, and immediately offered to let us stay at his place and he’ll do more returns for us yada yada. The least amount of work he had to put in to get high the better. We accepted his offer and needed showers so it sounded like a good deal. We pull into his apartments and it’s the same Senior apartments my great grandparents lived in that had just passed away that month. I knew Adam was older but not that old. He then mentions he lives with his mom. I knew how tiny those apartments were and started to regret accepting the offer to stay for the night. We don’t like being burdens on people or anything like that so I felt bad. We climbed the 3 flights of stairs and Adam is huffing and puffing. Surprised he never had a heart attack climbing those stairs. He introduces us to his almost 90 year old mother and I felt so much guilt then. The apartment had no room to walk. Adam’s belongings were everywhere. In the living room there was a small twin bed in the corner that we slept on that night. Adam rushes to his gaming corner. He has a desk with his tv and Xbox one. He sleeps in a Laz-e boy every night with his headset on, drool dripping down his chin, and his rolls hanging over the side of his recliner. He’s got paraphernalia all around his desk. He’s a smoker but still it’s wrong. His mom was so sweet tho. She really enjoyed our company. Her birthday was in a few days and she told me her whole life story. Adam treats her like utter shit. Video games and dope is all he cares about. His mom will try and ask him something and he tells her to shutup or he pretends to listen. My boyfriend and I are uncomfortable and just went to bed. 

So for the next two days we realized just how big of a piece of shit Adam is. He’s supposed to be taking care of his mom but doesn’t. She needed her benzo script filled and he hadn’t filled it in over a week! I eventually took the script and went to fill it myself because she was withdrawing and I couldn’t let it go unfilled for another day. Adam’s car was on a spare tire so we went and paid for a brand new tire on his car for him. We found out why Adam was procrastinating and wouldn’t take us to where we needed to go was because his moms social security check and disability check came that day. This motherfucker takes his mom to the bank cashes her checks and takes ALL the money. He had $750 and was searching for a quarter of black and a quarter of crystal. I was just flabbergasted that someone could do that to someone like their own mother. After he picked up his dope he went and bought himself a dab rig cause he liked dabbing after I showed him how. Then drove to the apartments and told us we could take the car and do whatever just bring it back. We went to the grocery store and my boyfriend got groceries. we remembered it was Adam’s moms birthday and she likes wine so he got her a few nice bottles of wine too. We went to drop the groceries off and filled the fridge up. Adam will literally go to the dollar store for groceries. The less money he has to spend on his moms necessities the more dope money for him. So sad. We gave her the wine and she almost started crying! She said she hasn’t had anything nice in a very long time. 

We didn’t end up staying in the apartment either we slept in Adams car for two more nights. I knew from my great grandparents living there that if the management finds out anyone that’s not on the lease is staying there then the tenants will get evicted. I overheard Adam’s mom worrying and asking Adam what they were going to do but I wasn’t sure what she meant at the time. Well two months later, I’m hanging with Trevor. He pulls up in a U-haul. I ask him what’s up with that? He tells me that he’s spent the last three days busting his ass packing and moving everything out of Adam’s moms apartment, while Adam sat on his ass playing video games. I guess Adam got his mom evicted. They were behind on rent and he wasn’t supposed to be living there. Adam told Trevor he would break him off some dope for helping too and when Adam didn’t Trevor lost it. So he proceeded to use the U-haul for two more days then returned it. I guess Adam and his mom stayed at motel 6 for like two weeks if that. Then they stayed in a shelter but eventually got kicked out because Adam was using. Last I knew, Adam and his mom were living in his little ass car. Dragging her around while he scores dope. Mind you, this was during December so it was freezing outside. I’m sure he was using in front of her too. Hella fucked up. His mom is definitely codependent and shit but she’s 90! She’s got dementia but in the early stage. She needs someone to take care of her. She won’t leave his side tho. ",1523419274.0

It got me thinking about how other then getting a couple hours Of sleep after we r completely exhausted. But other then that we all know during withdrawals sleep alludes all of us but I was wondering if anyone happened to know the scientific reason behind not being able to sleep.


It doesn’t make sense to me. Like every other sickness the human body goes through requires sleep and rest. It’s literally how and when our bodies heal.  But nope not during opiate withdrawals and I want to know why. 

I think i speak for all of us when I say if we could sleep through withdrawals we would prob make it through the w/d more often but alas we don’t have this luxury. 

So does anyone know exactly why this is the case? It sucks that on a normal non withdrawal day if I take even a crumb of a seriquil I’m OUT  for 12 hours and even groggy after that. When I’m sick tho I can take multiple full seriquil and maybe get 4 hours of sleep. 

The god answer is fuck you u did this to yourself now reap the consequences but I really would like the scientific answer as to why we are kept up during withdrawals he’ll if u guys can explain the reasoning behind any of the symptoms we go thru 
-RLS
-Diarrhea
-insomnia
-vomiting 
-anxiety 
-muscle cramps 
-loss of appetite 

If u guys know the scientific reasons behind these symptoms please fill me in! 

Thanks all and I hope tocgod none of you are experiencing any of those symptoms tonight

I'm just reflecting this past weekend and the amount of money I spent in a three day period.

I've been on sub since January and  doing really well so I thought I'd treat myself for just one day (I always tell myself just one day but that never seems to be the case.) So my parents were in Florida last week and I could go to there house to use to avoid my roomate who I didn't want to nod out in front of.

Long story short I took my last 2 mg of sub Wednesday afternoon around two. Bought ten thirties for $350 and waited until around nine am Thursday to blow my first three.. Probably didn't wait long enough since I didn't feel much, but felt more and more as the day went on. I planned on getting back on the sub Friday but that quickly changed so after work I bought another ten pack (350). Went to my paremts empty house proceeded to nod out effectively after doing 8 total.

Again, planned on stopping Saturday but I had two thirties left.. I thought I should just sell them. BUT I  brought them to my half day of work on Saturday and  quicklyfound myself sitting on the toilet and crushing one up. Now I only had one left and knew it wouldn't get me through the rest of the day and didn't want to risk PWDs by taking sub so bought six more after work ($210).

Sunday came around and I took a look at my bank account and it hit me that I spent almost a g in three days ($910). Worth it? Definitely not Thursday, but I'd say yes for Friday and Saturday.

What's the most amount of money you've guys spent in a short amount of time and did you regret it? ",1523410836.0

I have a bunch of old school tales.  I will keep each post short.  So do your thing boys and girls and get ready.  Oh – everything in these stories are complete lies and fabrications or fiction.  One or the other.  I think, maybe ;).

The Boss – A Bad Mother
The boss of the house was Price.  Price was an old school N who was all about business.  He had rules and order to his house and he got his cut from EVERYTHING flowing through from steaks to pussy.  If you broke his rules, you were barred.  Simple as that.  Price’s house wasn’t a trap house.  It was more like a party house or a hang-out.  Old school we would call it an oil joint.  A place where you could buy or sell ANYTHING and either take it home or do it there.

Being white and from the suburbs, I liked the rules and order.  Price made sure that everyone was mostly treated fairly and as safe as possible considering the environment.  I could send my girl to the house without her being harassed or ripped-off.  It’s not that things never got out-of-hand, but mostly things ran smoothly.

Price rarely got beat.  The reason was the way Price handled himself.  If you messed with him, Price wouldn’t call or threaten you over the Internet.  He didn’t spray your house with women and children in it.  He didn’t get his boys.  He didn’t mess up your car.  Price took care of his business with his fists and boots.  People who fucked with Price were beaten – severely, old school style.  Not bitch slapped, not fucked-up, not ass whupped -- beaten.  He would do it himself, alone, or maybe take a white guy along so that he wouldn’t kill the man.  Price would break noses, blacken eyes and knockout teeth with one punch.  He would take out a knee or break an arm if he was in a bad mood.  Price didn’t need a weapon.  His rock-hard body was a weapon.  His hands were like grizzly paws.  He was a ferocious fighter, he was mean and he liked to fight.  One time he beat a man that he ran into in Walmart, right then and there, in front of his wife and kids.  Price was known for hurting men and that meant that few tried him and those that did regretted it.

Could I remove the coating and dissolve the tablet in water and dose volumentrially? I've heard oral (and plugged!) BA is awful, but I could drip the solution into my nose slowly.

I'm afraid of fentanyl presses like everyone, but I have test strips for it, so between that and a seller with good rep (and a non-infinite supply), I should be able to figure out if it's pressed and just toss it.


I have narcan on hand and would have someone with me for the experience. Anything you think I'm missing? Even though I have a bit of a tolerance, it's nothing like shooting H or fent, so I figured I'd start with miniscule amounts (like an 1/8th of a 10mg).

I could get two 8mg buprenorphine sublingual pills, the brand is called buprenaddict. (Those are supposedly without Naloxone in them.)
So they are supposed to be consumed sublingually, I'm taking from the name, lol. But is that the most efficent ROA - seeing as I only have 2, I'll have to be very efficent with them.

I'm thinking I'll try to wait as long as I can after my last H dose, then take half a pill and see if I'll get into a state from full on withdrawal to something managable.
Then I'm waiting... and taking the next half a pill the next time it gets really bad? How soon after should that be?
I'm not actuall sure exactly how to dose this so that I don't just take the subs for 2 days and then get the whole full spectrum of H withdrawal only 2 days later, lol.
My goal is to get clean with the help of these making WDs a little more managable, maybe then I'll be able to make it this time.
Or should I try to put getting more of those bupre pills on the top of my to-do list bc I won't get anywhere with just 2 pills? My plan here is not to get on sub maintenance and stay on it here, tho, so I only wanna be taking them a few days for sure.

So, I have an Oxy tolerance of 140-200 per day. The most I normally take at once is about 60mg, but I'll usually end up taking another 30 or 45 an hour or so after. My plug gave me some ER Morphine (legit). I've been experimenting with the ER by first chewing 60 than the next day plugging 90 3x a day. I am not even close to withdraws, but I haven't felt all too high.


Today I plugged 90mg (Razer off the coating, crush than mix with 3.5mL hot water, let sit for 10-15 minutes and plug) around 7am and chewed 60mg at noon.


Is it safe for me to plug 120mg around 3:30-4pm today?  I'll also want to plug later on tonight 7:30-8ish. Would I be able to plug 120mg that soon?


For some more context, I have never nodded. 60/90mg of Oxy gets me feeling like Christmas Eve for about an hour, hour and a half.

My brother left Georgia in October 2016 as a walking skeleton. I had only seen him a few times in the decade prior, but this time he showed up looking thin and tired and somehow so grey and so yellow. He detoxed at our parent's house. 

He was also on parole, over H. However, he was clearly going to die if he stayed there. His Hail Mary throw was to board a plane and come back to MI. He showed up with a back pack. During the week, he realized he wasn't ready to go back to GA. He would use again. He called his parole officer to let him know he wasn't going back. His parole officer told him that would be breaking parole, but my brother never moved back.

Of course, my brother struggled during recovery. On my birthday, my Mom found a needle in the bathroom and my brother nodding off in his bedroom. There were slip ups. He made mistakes. I'm an alcoholic, so I know recovery isn't always smooth. Addiction is hard. But he was recovering!

My brother got a really cushy job! He gained weight! I found him a doctor that prescribed Suboxone, and now he is that same guy I remember from childhood. He still smokes like a chimney, but I believe him now when he says he isn't using. He has abused drugs for almost twenty years, but once I heard he was on opiates I was scared he would die. 

Anyway, my brother was back in my life. My family was complete. Then, when driving the car he was able to save up for (SO MUCH PERSONAL GROWTH!) he got pulled over for speeding in a school zone. The cop ran his plates and then took him to the county jail for GA to pick him up. GA wants my brother to go to court for violating his parole.

The county jail doesn't provide Suboxone, so my brother goes through withdrawal. He said it wasn't so bad, which was heartening.

I just felt so heartbroken because I finally got my brother back, and he was taking responsibility for himself, but this consequence of his actions still found him. I don't know how long he will be gone (he spent a week waiting for GA to pick him up), or what his punishment may be, but... I don't know. I'm mad he is being punished when he did what he needed to just to stay alive.

The good news, though, is that the lawyer thinks she can get my brother back to MI to finish his parole. I'm tired of waiting, though. I finally was able to enjoy my brother. We both have dogs we would take to the dog park together, and he would make jokes about the stuffy labradoodle owners. I miss him.

Okay, so first of all I'll have to admit that I did it twice. But I've been having an intense feeling that this shit will fuck me up and get me completely addicted. Although it's so relieving; No worries and no problems. Even better with weed!

Earlier today I smoked it for the second time in the forest, alone this time, and then I simply decided ""Fuck it, I won't do this shit again, let alone buy it again."" and promptly threw my remaining dope on the ground. I've experienced it twice now, no need to continue. I don't think that the risk is worth the reward.

It was a nice experience, but I'll do myself a favor and stay off it. I don't want a drug to take complete control of my life. Thanks to all of you though, I wouldn't have thrown it away if it weren't for you guys!

I missed more than a year of school. 365 days of school. 

During these times the doctors perscribed opiate pain killers. 

I remember I was a troubled child, and taking those pills only made it worse. (Broken home, lack of love, abuse, you get the picture) 

I didn't realize during that time how much those pain killers did a number on my mental stability. I never got addicted, but they really fucked with my chemistry at such a vital time in my childhood. 

My high school life revolved around drugs. I'd drink alch by myself, to doing x alone. Smoked weed laced with meth (There was a batch going around in my city.) 

I tried to OD on the opiate pills once. It wasn't much, but I rememeber not being able to move and just sitting on the stairs of my house drugged up, alone at home. (I was usually alone.)

Out of high school I started messing with ecstasy again. I dropped a bad batch and it really messed with my mind. I was in psychosis for a few years after that. Formed a mild schitzo, massive anxiety, and a boat load of other mental instability. Because of this, I lost the only person that mattered to me at the time. ex gf of 7 years.

My chipping got out of hand like 2/3 months ago, in that I was pushing 3/4 (and still am) nights of using a week. Last couple weeks I've had nights where I'm sniffing up to 7/8 points (granted it's not very pure, but still). Use for a couple days, feel great, then off, withdraw. It's not full blown or severe, but I'm literally detoxing essentially once a week...

I used last Fri-Sun. Spent pretty much all of yesterday sleeping, literally slept 14 fucking hours last night. Woke up for work, went in a complete haze. Mad chills yet I'm sweating, aches and bathroom trips every 45 minutes. Dissociated AF, look and feel like I'm severely hungover *and* decided to have a line of ket before work. It's seriously stupid, and very draining (combined with literally not having a **single** day off most weeks, I'm either at uni or working full time), but every time I decide to cop it and let my body groan. I feel better on day 3/4, have plenty of cash, so I decide to go pick up a half gram. Maybe I do the same thing the next night or two. Again, and *again*, and **again**. The dance continues.

A big part of me is definitely trying to put the brakes on, I know how fine a line I'm walking, and the only thing I've ever been somewhat pleased with my opioid use has been my total and utter refusal to use day-in, day-out. But honestly at this point this is feeling arguably worse.

Telling myself again that this week I will let myself fully detox and get my shit together. At least take a month before pondering my desire to chip. This shit is ridiculous. The money spent is ridiculous. But man that feeling of pulling up after the first fat line of the day is just so good :(

I feel stupid, shameful and just generally like I'm an embarrassment to my family and all the splendid mental help professionals that have supported me in the past. This isn't sustainable. Feelsbadman.

Ive showed up to his spot and had to use narcan on him so A. He wouldn't die and B. So I could buy my fuckin dope. Gave me a free 20 piece for it..  thats neither here nor there though

Anyway we start chatting and figure out we are both going to be walking the same way, after we got out of the gas station he tells me he's holding. Has (however much i want) of girl and boy on him. I decline and state again i'm on my way to intensive out patient rehab. He mumbles in his stuper about how thats cool for me, and he really would like to go to detox before he gets arrested because he doesn't want to W/D in jail. He mentions a few warrants he has, and i resoond plugging the rehab place i attend ( good program.) 

2 blocks into our walk an unmarked pulls up and gets out and screams "" Guido get on the ground now, hands behind your back!"" Guido complys then 3 more unmarked cars pull up, one of them starts harassing me asking if i was with Guido. I say i'm not and on my way back to rehab. They say i'm lying and get the drug dog out of the back and make it hit on me, i didn't have anything on me besides my prescribed subs... they let me go then turn the dog onto Guido, it hits and they find 2 bricks and a quarter of hard in his underwear. I walk back to rehab feeling more relieved than ever...

How are you doing? My life has been pretty insane. After a 2 week hospitalization that included 3 low-dose ketamine treatments I was discharged off of 0.5mgs of dialudid IV every 4hrs and 15mgs of oxycodone every 4hrs to an ultra small script of 30 5mg Oxycodone pills. My previous pain doctor wouldn’t see me because he’s getting out of the pain management business (to no fault of my own) and I hit withdrawals last week Friday prompting an emergency visit with a very expensive pain specialist. He gave me a two week supply of medication and told me to come back in 2 weeks and spend more money.

So, I followed up with an additional specialist covered by my insurance today and I don’t know how to feel about it. He immediately suggested I install a pain pump/spinal cord stimulator thing to which I politely declined. I've been through enough traumatic surgical procedures and want to hold off on this option for as long as possible.

Then he tried to put me on belbuca selling it to me as “for pain” and “not buprenorphine” he also gave me false information about how you could seamlessly transition from taking oxycodone to taking that without being in withdrawals first. 

I had to drive home the point that I had a seizure on buprenorphine in the past and was unwilling to take that without being under supervision first. To which he finally just increased my Lyrica dosage and switched me from oxycodone 10mg 3x/day to Dilaudid 2mg 3x/day saying it didn’t have the same reputation as oxycodone and not to drink with it.

I think I’m going to have to stay with this doctor though. He’s crap but he at least prescribed me something useful and he doesn’t cost $250 a visit wanting to see me every two weeks. He’s covered. 

I don’t know. Shitpost. At least I got something even if it is a 50% overall equivalency decrease. They give me the Dialudid in the hospital and it works well. So yah.",1523325378.0

I found an oxy connect and it was an infinitely better buzz.  We had a massive crackdown in my country on pills and the costs escalated and pills dried up.

Then I found opium. Morphine got me high every time, even though I had to escalate doses.

Then I managed to cripple myself spinally through sport, and was eventually prescribed oxycodine. Being an addict, I quickly raised my prescribed dose to 60mg a day, and I started abusing that to all ends. I was taking between 100mg-180mg a day. I would go through a month's script in 10-12 days. I'd go through WD, and then when the script was available again I'd jump straight on it.

But I found I can't get 'high' on oxy after a couple of days. No matter how much I took, I'd at best just nod out, but without any euphoria. I was swallowing all these pills without any pay off.

It was probably for the best because I no longer crave it, but it seems like I'm the only one this happens to. Oxy bottoms out in regards to the high once you've been an addict for a while. I've never done H, but morphine can seem to keep giving me a buzz if I take insane doses of it while oxy doesn't.

I took 130mg for my last dose last week and I felt nothing. In fact, I felt more depressed than usual. Does anyone else feel the same about oxy?",1523325283.0

Anyway, I was wondering if there are any other poly drug addicts around? For those wondering what it's like I'll explain how it works for me:

Every day, I have what I'd call an itch. An itch to be high. This is a different kind of high though; It's simply a physiological change. What I mean is I crave for any feeling that'll deny me of being sober. Weirdly, I'm fine with being sober. I feel like I've been vague so far so I'll explain my drug usage now - I'm young and I live in the UK which has quite a large drug/rave scene for my age range which means every weekend I'll go out and get drunk with another drug added to the mix, usually ketamine since that's very popular in the UK. Every few months I'll do mandy and during festival season in summer I'll do a lot of pills. This is normal for most outgoing kids in the UK. 

For most people this stops on the weekdays but for me I find that I still need some sort of drug to get through. Coffee at this time is perfect. I'll have a bunch of mugs of coffee on the weekdays for about 2 weeks, and then I'll switch to caffeine pills for 2 weeks as my tolerance increases and then with a click of my fingers I'll stop consuming any form of caffeine (except for chocolate and a fizzy drink here and there). 

Next I'll crave weed and be the biggest stoner for the next 2 months, starting with joins then going on to blunts and then hitting bongs and then edibles etc.

Next I'll crave a different kind of drug. Maybe kratom. For the next month I'll take kratom daily like with the coffee and then one day I'd just stop. Next might be alcohol and those benders I'd normally just have on the weekends with mates turns into some vodka every night and again, with a click of a finger,I'd stop. The worst part is that every year I get depressed for about 2/3 weeks. This is when I fuck with hard opiates, namely heroin. Other than codeine the other opiates are very hard to come by in the UK even with DNM's so I'll smoke a lot of H like I have been recently and again, just like I did yesterday, I'll just stop. 

I've also done LSD a few times (bad trips every single time, will probably try again in a few years) and shrooms as well. The interesting part, however, is that every year there are times when I'm sober and I don't crave any drug. This is always the time when I have exams coming up or a deadline for work. I'll be so immersed in my work that drugs don't even cross my mind and when I complete that work to a high standard it's sort of a high itself. As a result, I've always done well in school and uni and when I complete uni I've already been offered a mid-level high-paying job. Leading up to this intense work time, I tend to turn into a bit of a 'junkie', chasing each high, getting more drunk than my friends, doing every high I could possibly get my hands on and just being completely reckless with my otherwise safe drug use. I feel like I'm constantly chasing highs which has worked for me so far but I'm worried about the future so I have a few questions for you guys (and I'd be happy to answer any you have for me):

1. Are any of you functioning poly drug addicts?
2. How do you deal with it? How do you scratch that itch?
3. How old are you (Doesn't need to be specific)?
4. Do you think I could keep this up? As of right now I plan on cutting off all of my hard drug usage when I start my first career-oriented job out of uni
5. Are any of you non-functioning poly-drug addicts and if so, where do you think it went wrong?
6. Are any of you addicted to one drug and do you have any advice / questions for me?

(x-post from r/drugs),"I don't really know where to start this post, but I've been struggling lately. A lot. Been doing speed, alcohol and weed daily for months, with a couple benzos here and there. Today I met an old friend who's a heroin user, and since she knew the streets, I agreed to buying heroin together.

Now, I know that I probably sound like an ""idiot junkie"", but can't help it due to a ton of problems with me and my life. I'd rather be addicted to drugs and happy than abstaining from drugs and live in misery. My wish and goal though, is to do drugs in moderation. I don't really want to do drugs every day.

I met her, and we went to the drug dealing area with police at nearly every corner. We met a dealer that seemed pretty laidback, and she had bought from him before. We went to smoke it and I felt really good, relaxed and like my problems had just vanished away.

I just got home and still have the majority of it left(about 2-5 doses?), but I'm worried that this will lead to an addiction worse than weed, speed and alcohol combined. I'm really in need of some advice here and I'm not really sure what to do. How do I not get addicted? What should I do?

I've come across 2 12mcg sandoz fentanyl patches, I put the first one on my skin saturday around 7PM, the next morning I popped 9mg bromazepam and proceeded to have a jolly good day. Today I popped another 9mg brom and cut the second patch in half, put in inside my cheek for a while then chewed it, then nodded quite nicely pretty much all afternon, I mean I played a good deal of video games and watch a bunch of shows with my TV and PS4 not on... my tolerance for BZD and opis is pretty low these days.

Anyway, all this was fine and enjoyable but I'd still like to try to plug the last half and see how it goes, alas apparently the matrix patches aren't really the best for that... I've read about some people dissolving the patches and extracting the fentanyl (I don't know much about chemistry so I've no idea what it's worse but that guy seems to have given some serious thought about it : [reddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/wibtx/my_own_guide_on_extracting_nongel_fentanyl_patches) ). The idea was to IV it though, and it might be a little overkill for plugging... I mean if I can chew the patch then spit it out, I guess I could just stick it in my butt and fart it out when I'm done... Or is there a less thorough way of dissolving it? Anyone gave it a try?",1523318185.0

I only started going to pain management 2 years ago. The 4 years before that I was able to manage. Anyway I frequently take breaks from my medications. I know that my “withdrawals” are nothing like the ones some of you go through, my heart really does go out to you.... but it’s crazy because lately I haven’t had withdrawals. I make sure I pay attention to whether I need the medication because I’m hurting or because I want to feel good mentally. I have to frequently ask myself this so I don’t over use. I’m not perfect sometime I do take it for the “wrong” reasons but whatever. 

The last 3 times I have been “out” of meds or taking a “break” I did not really experience any wds. I take Imodium at a normal dose just Incase my stomach is messed up otherwise I don’t really need much else. I do have some Kratom caps but they don’t really work for me no matter how much I want them too. Someone on here once said a lot of withdrawal is mental, they are so right. Once my attitude changed it helped a bit. The more I was afraid the more I felt every symptom. This recent time I haven’t needed meds for 8 days and I have 0 cravings. It’s weird how it changes each time you stop taking them.

I hope everyone is having a good night, I’m enjoying the storms :) .....

So I wanted to pick up a g of ecp with a friend, it was my friends plug. I pick up the friend and we head to the dude about 30 minutes away, my friend isn’t talking much and just says hes tired, I think this is a bit weird but whatever. He asked me for the money before we pulled up which he never does, I park on the side of Taco Bell and he runs around to the other side to the dude. About 10 minutes pass and I’m starting to get nervous then all the sudden my friend pops into view and jumps in. He gave me my shit in foil and said be careful he couldn’t close the bag so that’s why it’s in foil. I’m like cool, seems like a lot and we take off. I drop off my friend and I go home, when I get home I dump the bag which is all powder into a mirror. 

(Some mini back story: I’ve given the dude 100 before and got a tiny bag with 3 rocks that got me and my girl very good for around 2 hours(prob fent). This dude doesn’t do it by point so I throw a number out like I want 100$ worth and that’s what I got. So I never know how much I’m getting, this is all thru my friend)

There’s a lot of powder and it’s more white then the last few times although it’s usually barely tan anyway. Well I’m chopping it up and my girl and I each do a line, starting to feel it, we do another, feeling good. Then I notice the powder is clumping it together and getting gummy. We try to smoke some and don’t feel anything, try to snort tiny hard rocks, doesn’t work. Tried to boof a decent amount and felt a little something for about 30 seconds then nothing. 

Ended up doing it all with only about 30 minutes of being high in total. Clearly it has some fent but what’s going on lol. Like it felt like someone took a .3 of dope/fent and mixed it with starch just to add up to a G. Makes me think my friend has something to do with it, like him texting the dude oh he’s about to spend 120 and he wants a g, give him a real weak bag and hook me up with the difference of good shit. The the 4 or 5 times before this it’s always been good but always looked tiny, my friend told me the dude does a g for 120, for 2 weeks I’ve tried to get a g and told he doesn’t have it or whatever.  Then this time it’s fine he can do it and I get a fat bag but it’s weak af. 

I give this friend rides to pick up drugs and I throw him money or drugs for helping me out when I need some and he helps. I think maybe my friend got sick of my asking for a g and told the plug to just give me a weak bag that’s big. 


Tldr; went to buy a g for 120, got the g and went home, got home to realize the bag was mostly just filler/starch, think my friend is cashing in on my misfortune ",1523298262.0

You may have seen me comment on here. Would love some input. I am 40 yo, was on opiates for most of my adult life. In 2015 got on subs, stayed on them for 2 years, then went to rehab to get off them (I tapered in that 2 years from 12mg/day down to 2mg/day) I just didn't want something ""controlling"" me anymore, so I got off the subs. Been clean about a year and a half now....
I'm seriously considering getting back on a low dose of them. Since being clean, I've been a wreck. Major bouts of depression, anxiety, and dealing with diagnosed bipolar disorder. I definitely didn't feel any of these negative chemical imbalances when I was on opiates (as long as I didn't run out and get sick) and definitely didn't when I was on the subs and had a script so I had them everyday. 

My friends think I'm nuts. Like the usual ""you worked so hard to get off that shit, why would you get back on it?"" Type of stuff, but seriously.... I have never felt worse in my life. I just can't seem to get my shit together mentally and physically. I don't sleep or eat right.... *AND its been a year and a half*

I recently made an appointment to see a psychologist in my area who is also a suboxone doctor. I dunno.... do you think it's foolish???.

I present this.

https://www.psychiatryadvisor.com/mood-disorders/buprenorphine-improved-resistant-depression-outcomes/article/368764/

I'm actually going to see if he'll prescribe it for depression treatment, rather than addiction treatment (since I've been clean for a year and a half)

I don't know.... a few months ago I got a half of an 8mg strip from a friend (4mg) I broke it down to .5mg doses, and for a week, I felt great. Mind you, with such a low dose I didn't get *high*..... but I felt way better than I had for some time. 

Studies are being conducted and they are finding buprenepherine is great at treating depression *in low doses*

Left to his own devices, his own unmade decisions, particularly in moments of solitude, he felt the slight tug blossom into a uni-directional yank.

Not in any pre-determined physical direction, but in a jagged spiritual pathway towards that which would bring him the sting of danger and the warm gauze of release.

It wasn’t a release in the sexual sense, or even in the spiritual sense.

It was the sweet release of determination.

It was hand slamming on the reset button, beginning the timer afresh, a new bright clear morning.


He’d tell himself: 

It’s the dawn of a magnificent new struggle, begun with the shapeless warmth and gentle eyes of that fiendish old current welcomed back into his system.


The struggle was surely just one of simple mathematics:

One day on, One day off.

Or maybe Two days on, Two days off.

Or perhaps Three days on, Two days off.

Or why not eradicate the bun entirely –surely it could be wiped out in a day or two– and hunker down for the invisible journey that awaits on the other side?

Tear through The Ten with a spiteful urgency, a malevolent glee; Tearing, Chopping, Sliding, Breathing; Stabbing the Angel with a sharp inward current of wind; Stabbing and Stabbing again.

Until there’s nothing left to Tear open.

And It slowly awakes, bleary-eyed and hungry from Its bitter cold slumber.


Decisions have to be made:

To take action or to hunker down and hope that it passes over quickly and quietly.

No doubt you’ll feel the Angel’s cold breath in your bones as it passes; It knows you’re in there, hiding, quaking under your damp bedsheets.

How slowly will it pass? How close will It come? How much of It’s icy breath will surround your skin and permeate your being down to your sick marrow and helpless lungs?


The ever-present question:

How close will you allow it to come?

How close until you rise from your sweaty bed and take that first step on your quest to find the sacred blade that will gash the Angel back into its sacred slumber?

How proud that first step!

How exhilarating that wind-swept first swing of the blade!

How calm and clean, silent and warm those first moments when the Angel drifts off and you sense It’s softly dithering snore.

How delicately ritualistic those first few motions that follow your initial frenzied swing:

The tear

The chop

The slide

The breathe

The stab

The Five Points of the Glowing Star that resides deep in your chest.

Beyond the heart.

Beyond the breath.

Deeper than your bones.

Deeper than your blood.

Smaller than the cells that orbit throughout your system.

Less quantifiable than consciousness.

Less alive than death.",1523293039.0

A few weeks ago I came out of a 28 day treatment center and has tapered down to 4mg suboxone over the course of my stay (it was an intense taper) with the aim of dropping by 2mg a week. So after 2 weeks I'd be off... 

Anyway. I ended up leaving with a girl I met in rehab and moving to her city; I didn't wanna go home first so I bought only the things I had with me in rehab (so I don't have a phone or my wallet). I had convinced myself, well we had convinced ourselves, that we had fallen in love. 

Anyway. This girl has a connection that can supply her with infinite amounts of methadone, so to get some cash she encouraged me to sell my last few subs(the things that were gonna get me off) for some petrol money.. and that I could use her methadone, also her Valium, of which I am fully dependent on her for both these things. 

We didn't stay sober for long, for the past 3 weeks we've been doing dope and crack quite often, although not everyday however I've been taking 100mg+ of methadone and 20-50mg diazepam... 

Last night we got into this vicious argument about the last chip of crack, it ended badly and with her saying shes no longer gonna give me meds... but I made nice with her today, told her I loved her etc... and she's given me 500mg of methadone, it's not the last she's giving me she just said I must try make it last 3 days before she'll give more(she has an insane amount, I can see 3000mg but apparently there's a lot more stashed) but that's not what I want, I wanna get off being dependent on this woman and odd opiates LIKE I INTENDED to when I went in to rehab. I was so fucking close to getting off for good before I moved close to her... 

I said this in the last post but be careful of rehab relationships, when you're in there you're lonely and vulnerable, on the outside things change..

So, what's the quickest way(if possible) I can get off with methadone using 500mg.... remember I'm a heroin addict, only been on 'done for 3 weeks...
