*Hi r/opis! This wasn't originally intended to be a story or even a reddit post and is more of an escalated note or diary entry. I'm pretty insecure about posting this, but I thought it was worth a shot to try and contribute some new content as I really loved reading other people's stories on here.*


*Feedback would be greatly appreciated! Even if this wasn't intended as a story I could imagine writing more so I'd like to know what you guys think about this.* 



When people just don't get the implications of having having a problem with shooting hard drugs




The best example would be another roommate of mine. Not the one who laments his Marijuana withdrawals, but the one who developed an unhealthy obsession with me and tries to make me fall in love with him. Well, I almost pity him. Speedballs are hard to compete against. 




I once told him I had a problem with shooting speedballs, but he obviously doesn't understand as he doesn't connect the dots between my being hung over or high as fuck. 






This week I didn't have any lectures at university. On Monday I was determined to use the week to recover from the 5 month bender to get back to exclusively using my maintenance morphine. Tuesday I left the house, walking as fast to the ATM as my short legs would carry me , withdrew the little cash I had left until my credit card was maxed out again and hit up the dope and coke boys. 




Surprisingly time I didn't even have to wait that long. The dboy is right at the spot, waiting for me when I arrive. The universe obviously wants me to get right fast or is there any other way to interpret this? Even the nervous, middle aged coke man, who deals out of his car, without the knowledge of his wife, waits on the spot when I arrive. As usual, the engine is running. Would he take me on a wild police chase if cops were to show up or is it just general paranoia or laziness? Another mystery I might never solve. He has kids my age and always tries to make awkward small talk. When I get in the car, his wife is on speaker, yelling at him in Turkish. He puts his finger to his lips and my 'Hi' thins out. I wait and fumble out the money as he tries to weakly justify himself. Not that I understand a word, but the tone is universal. He hands me the coke, I hand over the money. He asks 'until tomorrow?' I shrug and say 'I don't hope so.' and am gone. 




What I hate about this specific spot is that there is no bigger restaurant or cafe where they have multiple stalls in the restrooms. If there are only one or two stalls, the employees know who went in and how long they've been in there. Not to mention other customers knocking. Which is the worst. I won't hit any faster if you stress me, bro. 




Slight wd's creep with cold fingers over my skin as I shudder. That's the result of oversleep ing and missing maintenance. Instead of facing a half hour train ride home with worsening withdrawals I decide to pay a visit to to a consumption room that's one train station away. I hate going there but I need new equipment anyways and fending off overly helpful social workers is worth getting well sooner than later. I hate how they treat me, or people in general. I know that the usual clientele aren't the creme de la creme of humanity, but getting talked down to is really annoying. Especially when they assume your vocabulary doesn't extend beyond a toddlers. In addition I get all the shocked looks and judging glances as I look like a 12 year old despite my 25 years. I hate it. 



The young guy at the counter can't even talk straight as his whole attention is consumed by mustering me in surprise. 'I'm sorry I have to ask, but how old are you?' Gah. I tell him what he needs to know and enter the shooting room. Or at least I think I do. First I open the wrong door and a surprised girl, foil in hand, straw in mouth stares back at me. 'Sorry. Wrong door', I mumble as I close the door and proceed to the right room. Luckily I'm the only user present. The overseeing nurse is talking with another employee about her neighbors and shakes her grey mane in indignation. Apparently a very mean couple lives next door to the apartment she recently bought. I pity her quietly. That's the problem with buying apartments. It's easier to get rid of a spouse than of your neighbors. Still, I'm determined to buy an apartment. Soon. By the end of this year I'll have my bachelors degree. I scoop the brown powder in the spoon and throw some citric acid on it. Next year I'll be working full time and will earn enough to save up some money. Maybe even enough to support using and saving. I drop some water on the mix and light the tea light I always carry in my kit. In two years the masters course I already enrolled in will be over and I'll be ready for a PhD. The solution is a clear brown now. I douse the candle and scoop up some coke that I've crushed in one of my discarded flashcards and add it. Stirr again, throw the cigarette filter in, draw it up. Now I'm focused. Not even thinking of apartments or listening to the nurses chatter. Tying off my arm with the battered red tourniquet wondering how long it'll be before I need to get a new one. No matter. The short needle pierces the swollen spot on the inside of my underarm, right before the elbow, where a dark purple track sits. Looks like my arm got slit there. The many hundred individual pokes blend into the thick scar. Still, I poke again, draw blood out of this cushion of tissue. I don't even want to know what's happening there under my skin - this vein is more than busted. Dark red blood gushes into the rig. That's all that counts. I push down the plunger and my surroundings become very distant all of a sudden as this very peculiar feeling of heroin and cocaine rushing through my veins sets in. My ears are ringing a little, I breath very deeply and controlled as my pulse explodes. Too bad the rush doesn't stay longer. I close my eyes and enjoy the intense seconds before I can breath normally again. 





How am I ever supposed to quit this? 





When I get home I hole up in my room with my audio book. Red rising 2.  I prep a shot for the next day which is easy as long as I have enough to spare. It worked well enough the last weeks. I always kept a shot for the morning. By the time 11pm rolls around, I need to know how the book ends. I keep dancing around the inevitable. Me finishing the whole stash instead of saving some for the next day. First, I use up the filters and leave the stash alone. Then I tell myself that I'll just feed into my cravings if I have only one shot tomorrow and that I should use everything up right now. The sooner I'm out the sooner I can start recovering, right? I try to trick myself but soon give up. In quick succession I go through the familiar steps again and again until I'm cooking out the filters for the fifth time. The solution is almost completely clear. It looks like I'm shooting water. Almost feels like it, too. I shake my head at the sheer stupidity of my behavior. It feels like it's hardwired into my brain by now. Get up, pick up, shoot up.  I should take a break. I need to take a break. My veins need a break, too. Tomorrow I'll start recovering. From tomorrow onward I'll stick to the maintenance. But who knows what will happen when the next paycheck comes in?







I sleep until 5pm on the next day after shooting the night away. My head feels like a train wreck. When I meet my roommate shortly in the kitchen he seems sulky towards me. This can only be because I didn't reply to his text. He texted me some hours ago if I wanted to watch some series. I'm too hung over to say anything beyond a weak Hi. He replies in kind. He doesn't even ask what's up with me or why I didn't reply. He has this specific 'Why don't you love me already, I'm so nice'-look on his face. I hate it so much, but ignore it for the sake of peaceful coexistence. This guy really has a hard case of Mr. Nice Guy Syndrome with a side dish of delusions. A girl's smile makes him think she's up for marrying him. 





After I grab some toast I strategically withdraw back into my room, straight into bed. Talk, they say, communicate what's up with you! But if that's the attention the communicated fact gains I could've saved myself the breath. Though I have to admit that I wouldn't want anyone to bug me about it. Just acknowledging that I'm hung over and not concluding my being so quiet related to him would be nice. I don't know what he thinks speedballing implicates. Maybe he doesn't think about it at all. Maybe he's so absorbed with how I see *him* that he forgets I'm a person, too. Not only a canvas for him to project his desires on. Ever since he confessed his love for me things move from a majorly awkward silence to slightly awkward small talk, where he tries to impress with weird fun facts. I wish he never said anything. But what can I do. I don't want to or can't afford to move out. And I can live with it. And he can, too, apparently. I'm so exhausted that moving into a more comfortable position seems like work. I slip back into sleep, thinking about how much I hate being this hung over, swearing to myself that I'll never spend another cent on cocaine.





*Thanks for reading! I hope this isn't too crappy! Feedback and constructive criticism are welcome. I know it's too long and more of a diary entry than a story, but as I said, that's what it started out as, so be lenient with your judgment.*

and areas where BTH is abundant already know of this process to turn your tar into powder. I wrote this out in another thread and have had a lot of people message me and ask if this actually works. So this guide is for them. Cheers and happy nods you all!

* Black Tar Heroin 
* Baking POWDER
* Empty screw top Tylenol or similar bottle (Don’t use the orange medication bottles you get from the pharmacy, they break easily)
* 2 Clean nickels (soak in rubbing alcohol for a couple mins before using... money is dirty!!)

** The ratio of product you’re gonna use is 2:1  So 2 parts of baking powder to 1 part of BTH**

**1.)** Take the empty screw top Tylenol bottle and add the correct ratio of BTH and baking powder. 
**2.)** Now take the 2 clean nickels that you just sanitized and cleaned with alcohol and add these to the bottle 
**3.)** Now screw lid back onto bottle and shake vigorously for 2-3 mins
**4.)** Unscrew lid and look inside, you should have a powder that is anywhere for dark tan to light tan, this is depending on how dark your tar is the begin with. 
**5.)** Dump out your powder and scrape the remaining powder off of the nickels
**6.)** Now rail some fat lines and catch a heavy nod... Cheers! 

** You want the powder to be uniform in color and consistency i.e. the powder should look and feel the same throughout the entire batch. No hot spots (darker spots in certain areas) **

I hope this helps everyone who is interested. I have been using this technique for years now. It makes using BTH extremely easy. You can take it go, you can chop out monster lines, etc whatever. I usually put some in a small ziplock bag with a straw inside, so When I’m driving or on a job site I just stick the straw in real quick and toot away!",1522177438.0

My sister is a germaphobe and a hoarder. Weird combination, right? Her house is littered with latex gloves, used baby wipes, and opened bottles of hand sanitizer. She learned this behavior from our hoarder mother. My sister lives with her husband, their 2 young children, and our mom. The house is disgusting. Recently she offered me money to come clean. Being in active addiction, I welcome any odd jobs that end with cash in my hand, so I picked a weekend, even took off work on Monday (I work a 9-5 career of my own) and came down to visit/clean for 3 days. 

I did a really good job. Proud of how much I was able to do but hooooooly shit- the place was a disaster! Kids toys, used cleaning supplies, month old fig newtons, old mail... just so much garbage and general shit everywhere. I must’ve thrown out at least 10 black garbage bags- and I only cleaned 3 rooms! 

My sister and her husband have a lot of money. They are both doctors (tho my sis is currently out of work to raise their kids). This means my sister is constantly buying stuff. I threw out things that were unused just because they had gone bad or because she had so many of the same item already. I just don’t understand how people live this way. It’s embarrassing to even be around. 

I helped clean my mothers room too. Growing up we never got along but as an adult I bite the bullet and act cordial because I know she will never be able to have a civilized convo about everything that was wrong with my upbringing. This weekend I cleaned so much trash from her room while she just sat and watched tv. 

I hate this side of my family. All they do is eat, buy crap they don’t need, and watch dumb tv shows. I tried so hard not to judge and just clean as that’s what I was paid to do but the last day there I couldn’t keep it together. I didn’t blow up, but I did make some remarks about how my sister, who doesn’t even work, isn’t able to “find time” to clean (or even pick up after herself?)

I know I’m a junky with issues of my own, who am I to judge.. I just... I’m not really sure what to do. I apologized to my sister for being rude to her. She accepted but didn’t apologize back. I am thinking of going no-contact with this side of my family (at least until they wave money in my face again). This was hardly worth the couple hundred i got, though. The cleaning itself while gross, was easy... the family tension? Not so much.

Anyone else have hoarders in their family? How do you deal with them? It’s hard bc they get so upset when you so much as mention it....

Luckily my moms hoarding had the opposite effect on me and I own very little and keep what I do have clean. This only makes their lifestyle that much more foreign to me the older I get.

My aunt has been through a ridiculous number of surgeries. Its a family joke to call her Frankenstein's monster because of how cut up she was. We were talking about prescription pain meds and apparently she's been addicted for 6 years.

Always seperately (except when I tried fent+oxy once... I was [and honestly still am] in an incredibly dark place when I made that decision). 

These past 2-3 weeks I've stopped all opes, now I have a decent amount of tapentadol to try. 400mg gets me strung out to the point of near-delirium but comes with a MUCH better ""warm blanket"" feeling than tram, at times even stronger than oxy imo. Usually when I start nodding I notice almost immediately and jump back to reality, like when you realize you're in a dream and your brain wakes you up as if to say ""fuck off you only get good dreams when I say so, the rest of this one will be a nightmare just because""

This, however, seems to have a much better potential as an anxiety/depression medication than a lot of the benzos I've tried (off the top of my head are etizolam, alprazolam (Xanax), diazepam (Valium), oxazepam, flunitrazepam, clonazepam...) and literally every SSRI/SNRI/TCA I've been prescribed (one of the less competent psychs even put me on fucking daytime quetiapine, as though not being able to focus on anything and being groggy/irritable 24/7 would help with ANYTHING -_- )... I'm trying everything I can that might help since my last chance in terms of ""professional"" help after this is ECT, and after seeing my mother go through that I have no desire to potentially forget the few good memories I've made.

So, tangent over, tapentadol. Not only does it help with anxiety, it does so without turning me into an overconfident idiot like benzos do AND brings a sense of happiness and wellbeing comparable to the afterglow of a good DXM trip. Honestly it seems too good to be true... am I actually having heroic doses and putting my life in danger without even realizing? I have benzos on hand in case I start getting my seizure signs (tremors, gradual loss of control over my extremities, swinging between bliss and depression over absolutely absurd things) but so far even 600mg in a single dose without a benzo to go with it has been fine. Am I just being overly cautious or is this something I should be worried about?

Hurt my finger pretty bad the other night, blood droplets all over the damn place. I cradled my finger and rushed off to my manager to get some band aids. Bless his heart he was worried about getting me the whole first aid she bang! I then spent a good bit of time in the bathroom attempting to stop the bleeding. Good news is my finger stopped bleeding, the swelling went down, and its healing but I doubt I'll ever have a fingernail worth looking at there again. :( 

Declined to file a report, but sure as fuck to self medicated for the pain later that day at home. Dumbass mistake. 

I spend most of Friday night/Saturday morning in a blissful blackout. So blissful at some point I'd managed to sit on my lines I'd gotten lined up on the bathroom vanity, a good $50-$60 worth of mood levelers lol. I somehow managed to still have a nice pile of dope laying there so I start my Saturday morning right and do a fat line. Big motherfucking mistake! This was around 6amish, figured work isn't for another 13 hours I would be alright. 

I managed to still be nodding the next damn morning at work around 5-6am and fucking fell over only to be smacked back into reality by the painful blow my ass took from the concrete. My whole rump is black and blue I fell that fucking hard. I know I nodded out a few other times that night directly in front of coworkers and my manager... I also ended up with a big bloody gash down the side of my arm I'm still fuzzy on but it definitely happened at work! 

I ended up nod walking my home that morning, decided I needed an upper to counteract the dope. Was supposed to work that night but do to a series of conspiracy theories and misfortunes I didn't end up at work that night. I was absolutely convinced the public transit and taxi company here were somehow hacked by the same person who has hacked into my phone and creating mass Tinder accounts to fuck with me. The phones at in my hotel room were obviously tapped and being directed to this mastermind of a hacker! My old friend messaged me and I was convinced he was part of the rouse, only upon dick pictures received did I begin to realize how foolish I was being. Thankfully a friend had contacted my manager and he was even willing to come get my ass at the transit hub but in a fit of panic I left there and hightailed it back to the crib. Where I was panicking about being watched some more before finally falling into the deep slumber for hours that I needed. 

I feared all day today that I was fired, lets be real I have all the odds stacked against me with this job. But nope, here I sit on my ass in front of my manager while Redditing, sober. 

I'm living in a penthouse suite now so at least something good came of this fuckfest of a weekend!

My question is, what do you guys think about snorting tar using monkey water? My smoking technique is terrible so that's out of the question, tried it the first night and wasted a little bit. Ended up doing monkey water instead, and it got me decently high, so I'm doing it again tonight. 

I know that monkey water (and tar in general) is awfully hard on your body, but as far as I understand, snorting it 2-3 times in a week wouldn't have any real long term damage to your sinuses and nasal cavities, correct? Damage from short term snorting heals up within a few weeks/months or so iirc, no?

Been mixing it up with a few drops of water and snorting about a quarter to a third of a point every 15 minutes until I get up to a decent point, might not be as safe as smoking it but I'm not really chasing a nod or really getting to the point of being high enough where it's that dangerous.

Hot97 started speaking of the opioid epidemic, and how they do not like playing ""pill music"" in the morning. Promoting it for people that are on there way to wrk or taking their children to school is not something they feel suitable. It's not like they don't like ""pill music"", they just feel it isn't right for morning. 

Gun play replies to them as a hater lol, and that everyone down south wants to get hyped at 8am. The party just starting at that time he states.

Now this is when shit got real in the interview and really got me thinking. So he goes on about how back in the day when the minority's had a crack epidemic.

And I opened up with my PCP about my addiction and now she treats me nothing but an addict, regardless of her writing my uncle 2mg Xanax x120, 40mg Hysingla x30, and 15mg Oxycodone IR x120, a person I got away who enabled me greatly towards this addiction. I sure didn’t get these pills off the street I never hung with people outside, I’ve always been and inside person around family, and he was the main one who would give me Oxycodone and play dumb and say “here make sure you give these to your mom or sell em”.  We both have the same doctor, let her know months ago about his behavior with the meds (giving them out, snorting them, taunting shaking the bottle etc). And she replied “oh there’s nothing I can do I believe you but it’s in his blood monthly”. And all I need to stay on track is 10mg Valium 2-3 times a day and x90 50mg tramadol or a Hysingla once daily.. the tramadol as “weak” as it is, it really fixes a ton of my anxiety and pain and doesn’t give me cravings to relapse like other opiates do.. I’m turning 20 in May idk if age plays a role, but how can I get myself just some tramadol and Valium?

For instance if you were to have the Monoamine oxidase A enzyme within your DNA then you’re far more likely to have a certain number of behavior characteristics naturally that wouldn’t be derived strictly from environmental factors; aggression, impulsiveness, reckless, mania. If you had any sort of blue clues about mental disorders and how they counteract with with serotonin and endorphins then you would understand the they are CATALYSTS for suicide, drug addiction, criminal activity, amongst other things....which COOO COOO CATCHOOO, it sounds like from that aspect that having a certain lack of natural medium chemistry within your brain...something you CANT control....can lead towards a ton of perceptions and behaviors that a “average” person wouldn’t have access to naturally....which is why your perception is heavily skewed and misconstrued and geared way more towards your obnoxious superiority complex...since you can’t accurately understand somebody else and it seems you have a very hard time removing your emotional responses in order to rationally step into a entire different mind...I guess it’s safe to say YOU DONT know anything about psychology or anything expertise wise within any sort of field.

In the past things went well, but t was always risky. On two occasions Cliff sent the middleman to the ATM with my Card. On one occasion I realized I had work at the same time as re-p for dope and I cursed a storm..  was like ""ahh fuck."" At that time a few months ago Cliff was like, ""why you cursin, it'll be fine. You tell me what to take out and I'll withdraw the exact amount you tell me."" Despite experience to the contrary where he claimed to hear the automated system quote a higher balance than what was true. He probably went with the higher number that rhymed just so I'd approve a larger order. When I realized the error he said ""we can't shrink the order now it's too late"" which is BS because if you get in the car with a dboy and you have $70 less than expected, they're not gonna leave and say ""oh sorry you can't buy any portion of the original order.""


&nbsp;

Point is, handing a debit card to a junky is rife with risk despite their promises.


In the most recent instance, he knew I wanted out yet he begged because he knew it was my pay day like clockwork. In the end the very scenario that I was promised wouldn't happen, happened. It's really more of a miracle it didn't happen sooner and that there was only one incident of suspected deception. 


This being aside from those two occasions where the middle was entrusted with my card. Nothing went wrong on those two occasions but I'm sure I said prior on at least one of those occasions that I'd prefer if he didn't have the middle take my card to the ATM. To get my approval I'm sure Cliff said whatever I wanted to hear, ""don't worry I'm going to the ATM my self"" then the plans changed once he had my card and circumstances developed.


&nbsp;

Now, your feature presentation:

#Good news, 

I got what was owed to me on the day promised. Despite early promises that I would easily be able to get mostly cash, I shifted gears and stressed that I'll take any form of payment that is immediately available. If Cliff wants to give me cash, he can sell his pills and give me an opportunity to trade pills for cash but I'm not going to have him short me 5 pills, wait for him to sell them and then have no pills or cash days later.


So yeah, he did right by me but last week he did take $100 more out of the ATM than what I authorized and lied about it when I asked. Then as I investigated he shifted the blame towards his middle.

&nbsp;


Well, do I have a treat for y'all. I started to type up a transcript of a phone conversation that I recorded (and shall be erased after transcribing) with Cliff from last week. The topic of the call was my missing $100. Part of the call incldes me looking up bank records, Cliff suggesting that I check the store sureveillance tape and me arguing further that I shouldn't have to do that nor is it even possible.

Cliff argued it is possible for me to go to the store and ask to see the surveillance footage that would corroborate his story but realisitically, the store would only do this if I had submitted a police report and even then it would probably be the cops who get to see the tape --- if they even cared to review it. Perhaps if I had a lawyer they could put pressure on the store to get surveillance footage, maybe if i sent someone in a suit pretending to a be a lawyer... Anyway way too complex.

&nbsp;

During the phone conversation Cliff suggested answers and options. As a result, at least couple of times I said ""this is way too fucking complex, I just want my money.""


Like I said, I have a real treat lined up for you all. I just gotta finish transcribing the convo, then I gotta decide what (if anything) should be omited and then the format.

&nbsp;


Regarding the format of a story which contains a phone conversation. Does anyone have any suggestions? Like maybe it ould be typed up to resemble a chat room convo. Where it has..

> Sloan: What I said.

> Cliff: What he said in response.

_________


Alternatively, I could use this format....

> Sloan: ""What I said.""

> Cliff: ""What he said in response.""


The problem with this format is that I would have quotes nested within quotes for the parts of the conversation where Cliff quotes Derrick, his middleman.


_________


Then, my third and last alternative for formatting a transcribed and quote phone conversation would be to use the same format that is used in many novels. Such as...


> I called Cliff on the phone upon realizing that $100 was taken out in addition to the agreed amount. Cliff lied and said, ""I have no idea."" To which I responded, ""that's bullshit, you were the last person to use my card and nobody else cold've done it unless they knew my PIN and hd the card. I went on to ask, ""did you send Derrick to the ATM with my card like you've done in the past?"" 

> Cliff confirmed, ""I did not give Derrick your card.. but but [stutter] he was next to me and I went outside to take a phone call."" Cliff went on, ""Derrick said 'I thougt you wanted three like last time', and I said no, no, no, you gotta make this right.""


&nbsp;

So the first paragraph in this third and final example contains me quoting Cliff as he quotes Derrick. It gets complicated but I would reference an MLA writing manual and pages from fictitious novels before finalizing and submitting a post in such a format.


The point is, I can quote the conversation like a movie script, or chat room/instant messenger chat log. This ""chat log"" format can be done one of two ways as already mentioned.

Then the third option is to write about the conversation in a more ""natural"" way like it would be done in a novel.

&nbsp;


**TL;DR:** Cliff's script day went well and I was made whole. Nonetheless, I learned my lesson and if he comes to ask me to borrow money for dope on my next pay day, my answer will most certainly be a resounding ""no"". If he begs and annoys me and says ""I nver say no to you"" I will remind him of what happened last week. 

What happened last week? I granted his request with the stipulation that he is not to withdraw more than $200. Then he lied and denied it until it was impossible and proceeded to blame the middle. I plan to post a story or transcript/story based directly on a directly related phone call very soon


So aside from saying this week was a success and providing a preview; the goal of this post is to seek recommendations.


I seek recommendations for how I should format a story which consists 90% of quotes from a two person phone converstion with Cliff quoting a third person in order to support his accounting of events.

Also found gastritis","I've had back problems for years and was prescribed hydrocodone 5-325. It worked great for the pain and overall health for about 6 months, then I started getting sick shortly after it wore off. At most I'd take 2 a day, so pretty far from addiction levels. Anyway it got to the point where if I took even 1/2 a vicodin, I wouldn't feel any sort of pain relief but about 8 hours later I'd be sick for the next 24 hours vomiting. It only stopped after I vomited thick bile. Also a few weeks before the vomiting started, my stomach was sensitive to a lot of foods (pepsi, anything spicy, coffee). My stomach still has problems with these foods and it all started a few months after taking hydro. A few months ago they did an endoscopy and found I have gastritis, but the dr didn't think it had anything to do with the hydro. Does hydrocodone make my liver generate more bile?

Also had gallbladder removal surgery a year ago, and they gave me perc after I told them hydrocodone made me vomit. I was able to take the perc fine for about 2 weeks, then the same vomit thing started. After 1 week without anything, I took a fragment (like a single grain of sand size) of hydrocodone I had leftover from the year before. About 12 hours later the puking started again and lasted almost 48 hours until I puked up bile again.

Does this sound more like an allergy to hydro? The only reason I don't think its an alergy is because it takes several hours for my body to react, and the amount is so small it can't be wd. Has anyone else had similar reactions?",1522252745.0

I got a hold of 10 hydro 5s and I have several oz of bali and maeng da Kratom. Just did my last shot of my 30 a few minutes ago and want it to be my last. My plan is to make it until tomorrow morning before I start with the hydros, and was thinking maybe taking half or 1 of the 5s and 4-6 g of Kratom every 6-8 hours to simply hold off the dope sickness as I can’t miss work. 

I plan to take 2 for the first day or two, and then 1, and taper down over the next 5 days combining with Kratom. Is this even a possible taper plan or does anyone have any better ideas or some success doing something similar? 

Any response will be appreciated and good luck and stay safe all my opiate brothers and sisters!

I'm looking for advice from long-term heavy H (ECP) users. I've been using opiates for about 4 years, H 2. My partner and I go through anywhere from 4-6g a day. On really bad days we will have 3 (1.5 each), and if we had funds for it, we could probably comfortably do about 5gs each without even catching a real nod. 

Our tolerance is high, and we haven't gone a single day in all these years where we haven't had SOMETHING. Even with all we use, we're sick MOST OF the time. Not 12-24 hrs in sickness, but just feel crappy. I'll do a healthy shot and start jonesing for another 30 mins later or less. 

Are there any other heavy users who can give me advice on tapering down our useage to something we can keep up with easier, and stop feeling so shitty all the time? I know the short term will be tough but I'm coming from a place of years of use. Even when we cut it down to like 1.5/day each and are somewhat good with self-control, it's like our bodies never adjust to the amount and we're sick forever. So we just start using more again.

is there any way to prepare a syringe by drawing up cocaine (in water, obviously) first, then some iv-friendly, nonpolar liquid (as a barrier between the dope and coke) and then, finally drawing up your dope? so upon injection,  you would have the heroin going in first, then an ""inert"" (psychoactively) nonpolar ""wall"" (for the purpose of dividing the two) and then the cocaine...? the reason i ask is because while i love speedballs, i feel like the coke always dominates the high... and that goes for mixing cocaine with anything, iv or not. i always find cocaine to take over the buzz, which is irritating because i definitely prefer the opioid buzz over it (or anything else, for that matter). i heard from a former acquaintance that he used vegetable oil to prepare shots where two water soluble substances were separated by said oil. im just not sure how kosher it is to inject veggie oil. i was thinking something more like propylene glycol (or would that just act as an emulsifier, ultimately mixing everything together and yielding a traditional speedball?). id like to catch the heroin rush and once it begins to fade, be able to push the cocaine without having to hit a vein again w a different rig...

anybody ever try anything like this? or try using a ""saline lock"" or ""heparin lock"" to fix a needle into a vein for multiple injections without the trouble of having to hit a vein each time an iv administration is desired? especially when iv'ing cocaine, which is a vasoconstrictor, i could see this being very useful and convenient for someone looking for easily administering multiple injections over a longer period...

basically, im thinking of something with the conveniece of an injection port, without the gnarly, subdermal hardware.

Trashed everything like a tornado came through. She says she was sleep walking and in her dream was trying to fight off someone trying to kill her. She pulled all the drawers out and emptied them, emptied the pantry and fridge, threw every piece of furniture upstairs all over the place, threw the upstairs tvs against the wall and floor and a lot more shit. It's a huge mess. Then she went to the neighbors out of her mind and told them someone was after her and P. It's literally insane. Is this a psychotic break? Where's a Reddit psychiatrist when I need one lol? This is the first thing I've ever heard her apologize for but within 15 min she was back to cussing P out for locking himself in the bedroom to get away. ""Open the fucking door! That's my goddamn bedroom and if I can't get to my bed and make up and clothes I'm going to call the cops and have you arrested and divorce you and take your house you dumb cunt bitch!!"" Is the kinda shit she's sayin. She's just mad bc P is in there with a couple customers servin them and she can't get in to mooch. 




Ok I've posted about my crazy roommate before so here is some more. For those that haven't read before I live with a guy we will call P. He is married to J. J is crazy and delusional. 

A month ago J stole his car with no warning. She snuck his keys while he was nodded out and ran off. 2 days later she calls from a gas station to say she's lost the car keys and needs him to come get her lol. He gets a ride from my good friend wiffle and finds the keys in the center console with her nowhere around and takes the car and leaves her ass there. Later she got arrested for a warrant for probation shit. Probably while wondering around mumbling nonsense to people. She got out of jail a week or so ago and called P to get her but he wouldn't bc she also told him she wants him out of the house, which was his long before he met her, and she says she knows he and his brother bought the house with money stolen from her. She has no money and never has had money but she claims she's worth 2-5 trillion dollars. We've all tried telling her no one is worth that but she can't be convinced lol. So he wouldn't get her so she wondered around for 2 days until she went in to a middle school and told the principle she had been kidnapped and had just escaped. The principal called the cops and they got her and brought her here. When she got here she busted out my fucking window. Not to get in but ""bc the cop said she had to or else they would search the house"". I have no clue why she really did it. 

Since she's been back she's been crazier than ever. She claims she's him morrisons wife and she wrote all the songs for the doors. Whoever she's into at the moment she claims is the reincarnation of Jim Morrison and whoever she doesn't like she claims is the reincarnation of Charles Manson. She doesn't understand reincarnation bc some people she claims is Jim morrisons reincarnation were alive while he was alive and Charles Manson just died. 

Lately she's been hitting on me hard. P went out of town a few days ago and while he was gone she hit on me a ton. Said she expected us to have super hot sex the whole time he was gone and that she'd make sure I wouldn't get anymore drugs until I gave her some dick. Then last night when I got home from work she woke up and saw I had food from work and said ""I'll give you a blowjob for a piece of that food"". I ignored her and she said it again so I gave her a piece of the food and she asked when would I want the bj. I said no thanks and she said I couldn't decline that I agreed by giving her the food. Lol. P was right there next to her but he was in and out of consciousness and ignores her a lot. She also made a bunch of other comments like saying she bets I'm better in bed than him and have a bigger d etc. also recently I shaved off my beard and she's been crazy obsessed since then. She goes on and on about how good I look and how much the last chick I was with, who she's crazy jealous of, didn't deserve me and shit it's crazy. At the same time though she tries to hook me up with people. Sometimes she still suggests her damn underage daughter (who she now claims is her granddaughter bc her mom is actually her daughter somehow though she's 72???). This chick came by to pick her friend up a few days ago and was kinda flirty with me and J said when I wasn't in the room the chick said she wants to fuck me bad. The chicks tried getting in touch with me ever since but I have a hardcore addiction to IV coke+heroin which really takes up all my time and demands all of my attention so I can't really make time for a social life but J won't drop it. She keeps going on and on saying how good for me this girl would be and how good of a chick she is and how much better than my last gf she is etc. If J isn't demanding I give her my dick then she's trying to talk me into giving it to the girl from the other day or my pick of 1 of her daughters. It's really really weird. I just want to lock myself in my room and bang speedballs. 

J also has been claiming that her and trump are business partners and that her money is taking so long because of him. For a while she was claiming trump was her brother. Lately she's been saying she's turning into a snake but no longer claims she's an alien. For a few days she said I am her soulmate and we are evolved beings capable of having such amazing sex that regular humans couldn't even comprehend it if only I'd agree. All day today she's claimed meg Ryan is stalking and harassing her. She is completely crazy and has taken to following all her crazy stories by saying ""it is the truth!"" Or ""it's scientifically proven"" or ""I have proof! Do you want to see it!?"" But if you say yes she makes up some excuse to why she can't show it. She's also still snorting tums saying she's metaphysically transforming it to boy and girl. 

Well thinking of this is making me worry I might catch her craziness so I'm done for now but I will leave you with a messenger she sent a bunch of us a few days ago. Remember the person who wrote this claims to have ""a perfect IQ"" and was ""a prodigy child"" and is a doctor, lawyer, pharmacist, comp programmer and secret agent among other things. 

""Charles Manson P cut my jim baby out Jim burn it chris pop pop the trauma amnesia I think I J Marie pop pop (she calls her mom pop pop for some reason) try protect her we live jim twin not lil red head hitler eva our parents Bauer Braun they cia relocated""

Lol

"" u can not impregnate shape shifter just eggs"" 

""Trying bust P I am mba and attorney you intrapment(her spelling ha) I'm not prosecute not asking for back it bait""

She sends out crazy messages like these to groups of ppl every time she gets ahold of his phone lol. 

She's legit crazy and I have no fucking clue what to do so I just politely nod and say ok and I don't try to argue or call her out on her bullshit anymore. ",1522223558.0

Of these, the only ones that have ever actually gotten me considerably high were oxycodone/Percocet, Roxicodone, and OxyContin. I’m also pretty sure that once I got a blue 30mg roxi that was pressed with h as I’ve done opiates enough to know that within about ten minutes I feel a roxi but that particular one was almost white and it chipped when I bit into it, then it took nearly an hour to hit me and the high was extremely strong even though I only took half and it was much more body oriented and sedated than I’ve ever felt from oxy. Anyway, how do other opiates compare? Particularly, Opana (oxymorphone), hydromorphone, and h? How would I know if the blue I got was oxy or h? Thank you! I’ve never had a blue chip when I bit into it and they’re always a much more blue tone. Granted the pictures online of this pill were much whiter but they still had a blue shine.

Mine also wasn’t speckled like they almost always are which was kind of weird. I was thinking it was possible that maybe it was an expired pill and that’s why it chipped and took longer to kick In than usual. I just took a 10 and I felt it within ten minutes so I really don’t get how 15mg would take an hour to kick in for me. Thank you!! Also the reason I’m thinking H is because the girl I get them from is addicted to dope so it seems the most plausible explanation. and I’ve heard fentanyl is much more of a head high.

They sell tablets called Temegesic 0.2mg (1/5th of 1mg)

Some of the countries that sold or have sold Temegesic over the counter are: Mexico (though through loopholes), Thailand (removed from class D therefore no longer to be able to be sold over the counter in around 2015 i believe) 

Anyways,

They are used for pain primarily.

But there are no instances of abuse, overdose, or diversion

I am unsure of the pricetag

But if it was to be developed wholesale , and bupe becoming more available in general in many different forms (production of bupe per year has to be increasing)

would probably be able to offset the costs


Many countries offer some sort of Opiate over the counter, and Buprenorphine may be the way to go ,

it would prevent withdrawals, and if someone needed something for pain relief it would be able to be easily acquired . 

it would be dispensed similarly to codeine and dihydrocodeine , similar substances 
or like in the USA, dispensed similarly but with more strict guidelines (i.e. the patient has to show ID & sign form for each purchase of the med)

But it would make the med widely available to everyone

Even those whom cannot afford it

Possibly allow people to purchase it with foodstamps or ebt card

It would most likely stop people from going out of their way, to cop something like a roxy, which may contain fent in it, due to the war on opioids.

Nothing in the new documents about opioids, reference anything akin to this except for the expansion of the Suboxone program.

At least that’s what I tell myself before I experience that desperate anxiety that precedes coming to the conclusion that I usually come to, that those things I told myself I wouldn’t do, my standards; were soon to be broken.

I didn’t have a penny to my name, unemployment cheques only come in once every two weeks, so there is 12-13 days between cheques where I had zero funds. I would usually drive a working girl around during that time and she would help me out but we were in the midst of some petty argument about something, likely dope. As with most junkies, my universe was heroin centric and every problem I had, as well as every brief glimpse of joy or glimmer of hope was likely rooted in a poppy field half way across the world.

My dealer at the time was this washout drunk named Pat. He rarely left his house, which was ideal because I could dictate when I saw him, it was just a matter of getting there. He was in his mid-fifties, maybe 5’6”, with stringy, long hair tied into a greasy ponytail that ran 3/4 of the way down his back. He masked his insecurities with arrogance and alcohol, so it was best to hit him up during the day, as he was usually belligerently intoxicated by dinner time.

I had arrived at an impasse in my drug use, I needed heroin but could not afford any. I nearly accepted my fate and in the process of almost resigning my efforts, I washed down five 0.5mg generic Xanax (I had a script from my doctor). I think it was at that exact point in time that the wheels inside of my skull began to redline and with that thought, I dialled up Pat and asked if he would trade a point of H for a bottle of vodka...

I was on the move, it was time to hone my shoplifting skills. For all of my planning and preparation, this scheme went horribly. I was caught red handed inside of the store by the clerk but I did not let that stop me, I walked right past her and jumped into my car with 26 ounces of Stolichnaya and sped off... phew, that was close.

This part of the trip is a little hazy but I still have all of the necessary components to make a comprehensive story. I was well on my way to seeing Pat, actually due to the benzodiazepines I had actually passed my turnoff and ended up going the wrong direction. I didn’t realize this until I smashed into the car ahead of me at a stop light. That woke me up. The people in the other vehicles had their windows rolled down, telling me to stay off my phone, the jokes on them though because I was actually sleeping, it just looked like I was playing Candy Crush. The dude in the other car was totally unconcerned, his vehicle was fine. Mine was pretty crumpled but still drivable. He told me not to worry about it and left without exchanging information.

I did a u-turn at that intersection to get going in the right direction again only to be greeted by three cop cars in my rear view mirror. I thought I was going to jail. There was drug paraphernalia from the needle exchange, an open beer (I don’t even drink) and a stolen bottle of vodka in my back seat. 

I pulled over, answered all of their questions and all they did was give me a ticket for open container and a 24-hour driving suspension. My car was also impounded, which in this case was a given and probably saved my life. They knew I was a junkie because of the current charges I had on file and they were all very nice to me, they even offered me a ride to the barbecue I said I was going to, the one that didn’t exist. I asked one of the officers if I could get this bag of groceries and my bottle of vodka out of the car and they were cool with it, except the cop pulled the bottle out and set it on my trunk before leaning back in to grab the bag with food in it. The bottle wobbled as this large police officers weight shook my suspension and in the blink of an eye, that ill gotten bottle of booze was smashed all over the curb.

The cops dropped me off in the hood where Pat lived. It’s nearly impossible to steal from a liquor store in this neighbourhood because the shop owners deal with losers like me on an hourly basis and there was no way I could just skate past one of these clerks, bottle in hand, without encountering hostile resistance; not to mention the police car that just dropped me off likely wasn’t far away.

So I walked to Pat’s anyways, empty handed and hopeless. Pat never liked me, he tried to act all alpha male in group settings and he just generally treated me like a threat or less than or something. So I wasn’t expecting much when I stood there in his alleyway telling him the story you’ve been reading up until now. Miracles do happen though and he granted me a very small front. I gave him that bag of groceries from my car and hightailed it over to the ma and pop pharmacy that sells individual syringes for a dollar, snagged one of those and then went to use the washroom at Value Village to get this hard earned heroin circulating through my body to cut through the tension and stress wrought from the days events.

It was like I floated right over to housewares, pocketed a spoon, and then buzzed right through the door jamb of the washroom but not before I noticed the baggie on the floor. Apparently this shot was going to be a goofball because some tweaker dropped their stash on the way out. I prepped that shot on autopilot, only looking up once, as I met my gaze in that bathroom mirror, I took a gulp of air, held my breath and shot that solution into the only consistent vein on entire body—my jugular— I exhaled after I slammed it home, capped my needle and...

... I blinked my eyes open and I was on the ground, between rows of cars in the parking lot, gasping. The left side of my jacket had lit on fire at some point and there was a gaping hole where my hoodie used to be, i was fine though, aside from the singed outerwear. For the rest of the day, I drank 40 oz. beers with this aboriginal guy with one leg, met some girl who had cheques from her ex boyfriend that we cashed through my account and each ended up walking away with around $500 (cheque cleared too). Got myself a respectable amount of heroin with that money to enjoy the rest of my birthday with. 

That story was close to where I found my bottom. A couple of months later I was in treatment for 30 days and have maintained pretty good— not perfect— sobriety since. I went to go volunteer at the public library as part of my recovery when I came home and they require a criminal background check. I was arrested when I went to go and pick up my paperwork, there was an arrest warrant issued for me, for theft under $5000 on a $28 bottle of liquor. They issued me a promise to appear and the charges were later dropped without explanation and to this day I maintain a clean conviction record.",1522207723.0

Thankfully we got this dude to the ER in time.

Our middle owed us money and we went to pick it up today. He instead took us to get dope for free to call it even. 

After he came back out, we snorted our bits and were feeling pretty nice but then this dude just went completely unconscious in the back. I always fuck with him and he fucks with me too but after a minute or so I could tell he was NOT joking around. Obviously not a funny joke either way.

He must have went into the house and shot up while we were waiting outside.

Jesus I can’t even tell the actual story right now. This fucked me up.

I’m just glad he’s alive and that we found the ER fast enough in all that panic. The nurse told us we did a good job and I know we did the right thing but FUCK. I’ve never had to go through anything like this.

As soon as I heard the death-rattle and saw him drooling on himself I freaked the fuck out. 

So grateful we got him there in time.

EDIT: I know the fucking with each other part sounds stupid but we’ve never used with this dude or seen him use. I was under the impression that he didn’t use and just made money off of us. His brother is my actual dealer but he’s locked up.",1522195046.0

My dad and I live in Tennessee. Dad is in a wheelchair and on oxycodone for chronic pain. There's a certain number of pills he can take per day, but sometimes he uses less. When he goes to the pain clinic, he's supposed to show how many pills he has left in the bottle, but he's been secretly stashing any unused ones away for years. The reason he does this is because every once in a while bad weather will force either the pain clinic or the special transportation he needs to close down on the day of his appointments, and then he has to be rescheduled later. He had to go without pain pills for several days because of this once and swore he'd never go through it again.

Anyway, the issue is that my dad had about 30 days of extra pills at the beginning of this month and for the first time ever he forgot to get his refill at the pharmacy. So now there is evidence that he went 15 days without a refill. If the pain clinic is able to look at the pharmacy records (edit: or looks at the fill date on the bottle), they'd obviously know something is wrong here and that he had extras he was hiding. My dad has been freaking out ever since the realization that he could be discharged from the pain clinic over this, and that's why I've come to you guys. Is stashing pain pills like this illegal? Will the pain clinic cut him off from his pills? What do you think he should say when he comes in for his next appointment?",1522189410.0

Which means, I now no longer have a pain doctor. This was super fusterating and with just a month to find one I freaked out a bit. I finally was able to snag an appointment for the 2nd of April with someone so hopefully, that goes well.

Simultaneously I started to flare super badly. Vomiting violently multiple times and having bad bowel movements. I couldn't handle it. I went down to the ER and ended up being admitted because my labs were all over the place. Since my pain specialist is no longer my doctor I got assigned to the regular in-house pain team here at the hospital.

I realized I was essentially abusing and go through my script way fast taking closer to 30mgs of oxycodone versus the perscribed 10mgs. Bad. I know, but I was really trying to avoid being in the hospital and I ended up here anyway.

Well, as you can imagine I was very nervous to talk to the in-house pain team about this. i explained to the doctor, ""I was perscribed 10mgs but was really needing 30mgs in a day and now I'm flaring and its hard to keep it under control"" to my surprise he organized my pain meds to match what I was used to versus what I was prescribed and has promised to send me home with a comparable script. He also recommended I do a ketamine infusion. Which, I am now scheduled to do tomorrow. I'm super nervous about it, but hopefully, all goes well.

On top of that, I should be getting some good recommendations for pain specialists. So, that's a bonus/plus too.",1522184812.0

So many years ago i had gotten out of rehab and had nowhere to go, moved with my partna to usa but that didnt work, so it was off to usa to live with my best friend who had been forced to move to usa where his uncle had a carpet business after his 3rd dui. We were both only 21 and 22 at the time he had been racking them up since HS. Luckily he had already been in durham for 6 or 8 months, ""clean"", and just got a nice new 1br apartment after having lived with his strict ass uncle since he got there. I hadnt seen him in months...wasnt sure what to expect. (For reference lets call my boy W.)

Welp i walk in the door after catching a greyhound from usa to usa and its a reunion. Hes got like 4 norcos on the counter (5s) and maybe a blue football or two but the second i laid eyes on him i knew. Motherfucker has been doing good and has started to get his shit together but has the itch to go hard bad. Once we split the hydros (that was my test since i was pretty fresh out of rehab - long term Scientology rehab) he broke out the dope. I was ecstatic. Unfortunately he followed with ""i think this shits fake. I got it from a hooker out of the yellow pages but it doesnt get me high."" I do a shot its bunk. I said youve been here how many months and don't have a connect? I was always the resourceful part of the team. We were best friends since 9th grade (him a year ahead of me at a diff school). Sniffed our first bag together my senior year. Shot up together a year later. Crashed and burned. I started to understand why he wanted me to move to usa so bad...he knew id sniff out some dope. And i did before long. I also made a bunch of local junkie acquaintances thru bluelight topix and opiophile and before long we was strung out again.

Someone had got us some bags from usa that were bomb...and i got the dudes number who sold it. Honestly we were gonna rob the guy and he sensed it and would not meet me even tho i called every day for two weeks. We had a local plug who was cool...hood ass usa dude always with his sidekick poo or his gf (who i still talk to 7 or 8 yrs later. This was when mephedrone hit scene we got big into IV 4mmc i have some stories from that)...but this other guys dope was a 10/10 plus it was gonna be free so finally he agreed to meet me. But he was sending a runner. Some chick. Even better i thought but he wouldnt send her with anymore than like 8 20 bags.

My boy W had a big white van from his carpet job and we drove to the meet spot at walmart and honestly we had the tools and were gonna kidnap this chick. She calls as we pull up and throws a curveball wanting me to go inside the store with her and buy cigs since she had no ID. I hop out and she is waiting under the flag pole front like she said...i guess my dumbass fell in love. Didnt rob her. Sweet talked her out the dope she brought (turns out the d boy was her ex) and set up a date for the next night.

A bonnie and clyde situation ensued.

Little info on the woman.

She was honestly my first out of high school supposed to be ""adult"" relationship. Total whore. Anal on the table the first time we hung out girl. Attractive in a slutty way. Full probably $4k back piece tattoo buddhist related for no reason...lots more ink...in tattoo mags at one point. Super bisexual. My slam piece. It all came at a price tho i would find out.

I started to sell tar in a mainly ECP area after making a 7 hour round trip to pick up and bring back. They ate it up man and since i was new to the area she put me on this whoooooole group of people and i blew up. She also introduced me to her mexi plug so really top to bottom she put me on.

I got 14 dime singles of tar for 100 brought back to where i stayed i could sell each balloon for 25 really all the way up if i wanted. Raised my startup capital by robbing her ex who was a dealer for 80 balloons one night while he OD'ed. They claimed to be besties but she basically robbed this guy blind every single chance we got (we hung out alot) and even told him right after when we bout ran a train on his current girlfriend (Cs mom walked in thinking we were shooting up. No your daughter is munchin cat i got my dick in her mouth. Beautiful girl. Dead now). She told dude and i happened to be there in his room and he threw about 7g of tar on a cooking spoon and tried to do a mega shot and die. His new only few weeks in GF cheated on him with his whore ex whose supposedly his best friend and satan (me). He did fall out i took all of the dope and cash hit him with 8mg of subs and when he was lucid i dipped. He got over it and they stayed together until she passed. Edit: so i was always mad i didnt get to fuck that girl. I even let it slip to C that i was mad her mom ruined that and a HUGE fight ensued bc apparently she can initiate 3somes i just cant want it to happen or remember it fondly. Yes typical immature jealousy bs. Anyways. A couple years fast forward (as all you will find it ended i moved) C and the chick would come down to where i moved to and we had this amateur night strip club hustle where they would enter amateur night, id make it rain some singles hype em up to win like i didnt know em. Theyd pick up my drizzle money plus my enthusiasm usually made C win the other chick usually got 3rd which was 20-50 i think ANYWAYS thats not the point the point is i smashed and it was awesome sauce. She did wanna know if she gave better dome than C since they both dated the same guys and yeah C loses that one.

Ok hold on. I know i sound like a POS. And i was. But i didnt treat everyone like that. This was my current girls ten year ex BF and best friend. Constantly surrounded by him and his friends and these cats were mid to upper 20s emo band guys which is not my scene (idk what i am a hippie who wears polo. Really just a junkie). Every time they hugged and inside joked and did their thing jealous young buck me decided it was fair game to use and abuse the dude. I mean my chick orchestrated it. He was business competition as well. He was closer to the main clique but i could afford to pick up ten times what he did (same plug). I got sketched one week after mofos kept falling out in my nice ass house and enacted a strict NO SHOOTING policy. He stayed over one night and had just re upped. Did a shot i caught him warned him. Went to bed and woke up early to make a sale and he was nodded out on my couch (did a shot again) but had every single balloon arranged by color and in bundle count on my kitchen counter! Yes i took like 95 of the hundred bags and when he woke up freaking out i told him i had people in n out all morning why was he disrespecting my house fixing up again and leaving shit out like that. I mean that was a 2grand mistake lol. Yes i was a bad person...mostly to that guy tho. I gets my payback later.

Edit: you must want to know about the dope! It was tar. Good tar. We were all heavy users and 3 singles .1 to .15 each was all the heaviest user could really do. I always gave W dope and 3 bags was fine but if i dropped a balloon and he found it and did 4 he went out. This stuff was gooooood. I was doing about ten bags a day. We had people close to us half keys of 4mmc and we got really into shooting that shit in mass quantities. I would watch W do a half gram shot and his hips would stick up from the couch and he would hump the air uncontrollably while his eyes rolled into the back of his head and his jaw so crazy he couldn't speak even tho he really wanted to tell u how awesome that shot was. You could redose the shit all night like coke. We had a party with like an oz out one time and this poor girl was too fuckef up to hit and i kid you not 6 spunions all surrounded her all with loaded bent ass used bloody rigs like eyeing her with one eye open offering to hit her like EEEEEK. Miss that shit bad.

Me and W thought we were on our way to the top. Me and him lived in a 1br apt with sometimes up to 4 100lb professional german shepherd show dogs at a time. W went to work with his uncle every day and kept the clean act up and uncle rewarded us with a badasssss town home 250k plus we were renting to own basically.

We had a nicer house than we could have imagined at 21 and 22. He moved up ranks at work and i had so much cash my high ass didnt even count it like i shouldve. Unlimited free dope for us. I ran a pretty tight ship and other than a couple bad OD scares during parties (one i will never forget was during a mephedrone rager that ruined me just getting glowstick number 2 in Cs ass. Had to rush dude to hospital with a car full of people whod been shooting crazy huge 4mmc shots ALL night. Me C and dudes friend end up in notoriously strict small town police station at 2am...i was only one coherent enough to say we found OD kid at a party no one would help so we good citizens saved him) we thought we had it going on. This is when C started to work her magic.

So I mean the whoreness and willingness to rob her ex who was supposed to be her bff or whatever and the heroin addiction would have been red flags to most normal people that chick was off and no good to wife up but i found myself engaged.

She was a smart girl tho. Conniving as all hell. She was the kind of chick who would seek out guys with girlfriends and fuck them and then tell. Married guys too. I was at her moms in this old playroom of hers and i stumbled across some paper she had from HS i guess where she'd listed all the dudes shed slept with and number of times. Boyfriends obv got name - 10000x but that shit was like triple columned with some of her parents friends names. It was alot. I told myself it was not a bang list at the time but she was ""goin"". Fa sho. Heh. Speaking of the playroom and this is real fucked up but her stepdad molested her and her mom didnt leave the guy and we had to move in with them at one point and when u hear ""you cant fuck me in here my stepdad used to"" and then u go downstairs to get a glass of milk and hes standing there like hey buddy it fucks u up. The mom was nice and we would talk about what happened and the girls hid the abuse (older sis too) for years until they were well into their teens and hog ass wild and no one knew what to believe but anyways i felt like i had to stay with her and protect her.

Anyways this part is really what i meant to get at...how she came between me and my best friend.

C and W got along but i mean we were higgggggghhhhh. And C was real girly and decorated like idk rustic artsy fartsy stuff on the walls and shit and she cooked and i mean we had a nice place but we were young and a womans touch really tied the crib together.

Shit started to get a bit tense bw me and W and it really had nothing to do with C at first. He was jealous he had to get up and work every day while i got to stay home with all the diesel sleep all day fuck my girl have all the $$$. He still worked for his uncle and had to put on a gameface every day and even tho i kept the bills paid kept dope around 24/7 and all that he was just jelly. And i dont blame him. C wanted me all to herself and wanted all the attention and she capitalized on the situation.

Well fuck me and fuck heroin. The entire 7 paychecks I got while being miserable in an office job went to the dealers just to stay well enough to go I to work to earn. A cycle of vicious insanity..

I've had to use a tiny amount every day to get through. It was pay day today and I get a text from my god damn dboy saying he will deliver. So lunch break I run to an ATM. 20 minutes later I'm out front in his car. 10 minutes after that I'm in a toilet cubicle.. then, Uh-Oh, back at my desk I realise I've left  the foil tube in the toilet..


Aaaand, inevitably, 30 minutes after that I'm in a private meeting with the managers questioning me about my toilet habits, whether or not I use drugs.  I know where this is leading . 
They ask to empty my pockets. No chance. I ask what they'll do if I don't.

They say they'll fire me on the spot as they have reason to believe I've been using drugs 

Fine. I say. I quit. Gathered my stuff, handed in my door card and walked out.

To be honest, I was holding onto the job because of the money and stability, but the stress of repetitive office work was pushing me over the edge. The petty nature of every mistake (think Office Space), dealing with customers who are morons, meetings about meetings about targets.

I'm glad I didn't have to finish out the month and I didn't even get asked if I was okay just told to leave. Thanks for caring. Thanks for allowing me to explain. Just - no drugs at work, all the months spent getting to know you as a person above and beyond being just a manager meant nothing.

This person to person interaction reminded me of another time... Being at the doctor asking for help. Easily just as cold, total lack of empathy, incredible poker face showing absolutely no hint of emotion whatsoever.


So, I've left the company, collected all my stuff (shut, just remembered I forgot my phone charger) and it's payday today. No additional work done, no arguments there.. you think they will call the police or anything or is that the end of it? Do managers just deal with it or will this get sent up the flagpole to the CEO (most likely as he deals with everything and is CC'd in on every little detail that happens)


I wonder what he will make of it.

I can't believe I was in and out the company in less that 5 minutes. Gotta be some sort of record. I just pray that it truly is over now.

They don't have anything on me actually, all circumstantial and I wouldn't open the tin in my pocket so I didn't reveal anything. I think the only thing they have is a really tiny (about 5cm³) burnt piece of foil.

Any thoughts?

Edit to reply to some replies:


------------

- Regarding claiming benefits:

I'm in the UK, so I don't know how it works here. Basically, I don't think they have anything on me except for finding a piece of foil, somehow attributing it to me and then interviewing me and I refuse to empty my pockets for 'personal reasons'.

They said that they have 'reason to believe' and that if I don't prove myself then I'm fired on the spot. I didn't admit to anything, they can't prove anything and it seems we both made it easy for one another (I walk out agreeing to quit on the spot, they don't have to do any paperwork or disciplinary hearing or anything. The whole thing is over in less than 3 minutes)

- To everyone who has read this as me blaming everyone but myself. You couldn't be more wrong.


Has everyone read what I wrote completely wrong? Why is everyone telling me the bleeding obvious.. I know what I did wrong.. I know the company drug policy. I expected everything that happened, I was half expecting it to happen at some point - but I did my very best to avoid screwing up.. but unfortunately, circumstance as they were, it was payday, the guy who has been keeping me well for all this time decides to present an addict with an opportunity he cannot turn down and I went too far.

Look - I'm not blaming anyone but myself and I wouldn't and couldn't do so in good conscience.. Of course I'm upset at myself more than anyone - especially because of all the time I spent trying to get well and not being able to make it.

What I'm really pissed about is that I've busted my ass to conform to something a company wants, only so that ultimately, I can work my ass off for someone else and be a tiny cog in a giant corporate machine. It was a really difficult and stressful job anyway. The introduced a policy where if you don't take a day sick leave that month, you get an extra $200 in your monthly pay.. Consider that for a moment. The job is so stressful, it was pushing people to take sick leave to get well again and I haven't had a single day off since I started in September - all that means that no matter how sick I was, I always went in - way above and beyond almost everyone else working in my department.

Let's be clear - I never once nodded out. I was using to stay well and make it into work. I was using so little that by the time 5pm end-of-shift rolled round, I was already sweating and feeling sick, waiting to get back home to use the tiny bit more that I saved ready and waiting for me.

Please understand, at no point was I using for pleasure (which would likelytake probably $100 a day, and I was using closer to 20-30 a day.

- As for expecting some sympathy. I don't. I joined the company with a habit expecting to be able to fix it at some point. However, I wasn't expecting sympathy from the policies the company has set up with regards people using drugs on site and at work - however, I was talking about the individual people I have met and gotten to know. Absolutely stone cold. After all the emails that I got sent by my manager asking if I was okay when I was sick with the flu and a severe chest infection that was doing the rounds within the department. If I was coping okay with stress - because my mum had an major hip replacement operation and my dad has been diagnosed with dementia. These facts somehow made it out of co-worker discussion and up to my manager. What I am saying is that there were numerous occasions where it seemed like I was being worried about - now when I look back it seems less about caring about me as a person and more about being asked if any personal issues are going to affect me and my performance as a worker because as I said, when it came down to leaving because of what could be percieved as srug problem - who cares about me - I'm obviously incapable of work now, I've got to go. The ultimate kick in the teeth - no income, severe mental health problem, underlying personal reasons for doing this in the first place - fuck all that. Stone cold goodbye.

882ecu,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/882ecu/plugging_vs_snorting_dilaudid_hydromorphone/,27,https://redd.it/882ecu,Algoresdog,Plugging vs snorting Dilaudid (hydromorphone),"Let's be very clear - I have a 3 year habit of almost exclusively dilaudid and I can tell you with 100% certainty that plugging is a much more effective ROA. There are websites that suggest that it's actually a lower absorption rate, but I believe that data is flawed.

 Based on my experience, you will get anywhere from 10-25% stronger effects from plugging hydromorphone. Furthermore, the effects will last anywhere from 2-3 times as long. The only mild advantage to insufflation would be probably 10-20% stronger rush, if that.

The caveat here is that you MUST be sure the receiving area is clear. I would recommend buying a cheap low volume enema from Walmart ($1). I prefer to empty the saline since it is almost painfully effective and simply use water. I insert one enema, refill, and then do one more. I then move around as much as possible to get it mixed up, and 5-10 minutes later will void my bowels. 

The best administration device I've found is the 5ml syringe found in children's equate brand Tylenol. It has plenty of room for dosages up to 50mg while being skinny enough to not hurt when inserted. The 10ml syringes that they sell separately are certainly effective but I find the size of it is just uncomfortable to put in my anus. The best way to avoid losing any product in preparation is to place the pills inside the syringe, and draw up water, then allow it to dissolve for anywhere from 20-30 minutes. In this way you can avoid losing residue involved in crushing and transferring. You will also not have to worry about potentially spilling part of your dose.

Once you've cleared the receiving area and your dose is ready, use Vaseline to lubricate and make sure the syringe is fully inside your anus (all the way to where the push syringe starts. There will be a slightly larger lip that should prevent you from pushing the syringe in any further. Don't push further! Losing a syringe in your ass is certainly not worth it and you won't get any benefits from going deeper than this). After pushing it out inside, refill the syringe with water and redose to get all the residue. This will also help make sure there's plenty of volume of water in there. 

After administration, lay with your legs in the air up against a wall so that the dose goes downward towards your head. Stay in that position for roughly 2-3 minutes and after that you can do whatever you want.

Hope this helps anyone who's wondering best ROAs for dillies. Remember to be safe and consider that potency increase if you're used to snorting. The best option for a first time plugger will be to plug 1/2-3/4 of your normal dose, and from there you can add on via insufflation if you feel the need. That way you are working all your possible routes of administration and you don't have to worry about possibly overdosing. 

Good luck to all, and happy nods.",1522338974.0

I want to support this community and am excited to now be part of it!**

feel free to add, correct me, comment, ask or anything else. can discuss other medication interactions too :) lets make this an interaction thread stressing safety.

**eg with codeine+valium mix**

* INormal codeine metabolism:* Codeine metabolised to morphine by effect of (example) 10% capacity CYP2D6 enzyme used, 20% capacity of CYP3A4 into norocodeine (inactive mostly

* INormal valium metabolism:* metabolised to temazepam significantly by CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 eventually to oxazepam (not important in this particular interaction.

* Normally. lorazepam/ativan is glucuronidated to compounds. Morphine relies on glucuronidation also in order to break it down; Thus atvan before morphine (or codeine, which ends up morphine), may prolong the effects if morphine.

**IF VALIUM TAKEN BEFORE CODEINE:** CYP3A4 enzyme is going to be depleted or saturated with valium molecules, More codeine funneled to CYP2D6 as 3A4 pathway blocked to an extent (depends on dosages etc), thus more than 10% morphine of codeine dose potentially created.

Add this to addirive CNS depressant effects, may be dangerous. 

*TLDR*: valium (in this particular discussion/case, signfiicantly potentiates the metabolism of opiates/opioids such as codeine, oxy etc due to valiums strong binding affinity to the 3A4 enzyme, basically preventing (eg) codeine from using that pathway, so itll use more towards 2D6, the active morphine compound. This doesnt consider additional problems like additive CNS depressant effects

I had to retrain for it, and when I say retrain I mean I had to work full time whilst studying for a postgraduate degree in order to do it professionally. That was between summer 2015 and summer 2017. I took a short break during the Autumn, and now I'm back in the city I belong in, doing the job I've always thought I'd be really good at.

And with this responsibility comes great rewards: a salary I didn't think I'd be earning until I'd gained at least a couple more years experience in the field. 

But, you know when you start a new job and they don't process your paperwork fast enough? So they stick you on an emergency tax code, and you end up getting a lot less per month than you thought you would?

Well, that was January's paycheck *and* February's paycheck - two pretty tight months. But, March's paycheck? The paycheck that went into my account at midnight last night? Well, that *was* my full salary, along with a rebate of the tax they took too much of during January and February. 

When I opened the payslip yesterday I almost screamed. 

And so I stayed up till midnight, and when I saw that money clear I called my delivery boy instantly for a nice little heap of beautiful brown dirt-looking gear; the money cleared at midnight and by 12.30 I was nodding peacefully in the knowledge that every month from now on I'll be getting money equivalent to my hard work at that job, the hard work I've been doing for three months, and the hard work I trained for two years to do.

This, along with the fact that today was my last day in that job for a full paid two weeks off: I'm not back there till Monday 16th, and I've got more money to play with than I've ever had in my life.

I'm a functioning addict - yes, I know I am. Possibly a high-functioning one. My addiction doesn't impact my ability to do my job. No, it doesn't.

And now I'm home, I'm high, I'm content, and I'm happy to tell you that yes, this could be you.

Is this just how it is for some people when using this ROA or is it simply cut to shit / not even heroin?

I have seen and heard some horribly unsafe things lately, and am looking for an angel like Tracey who may be able to help, as this situation goes far beyond me.


If anyone knows Tracey's username (or if she herself or someone similar responds), I will PM them with all the details and see what- if anything- they can help with.

Yes, some supplies could be used for me, but there are well over a dozen people that need help....and where I live, there are no needle exchanges and, although legal, there are no places within 90 minutes who will sell supplies and it is impossible to get narcan/naloxone.

I try to promote safe usage, but some people do not seem to care as there are no readily-available alternatives to dirty/shared needles. (And this is affecting more than just opiate users.)

I desperately need help, for others and myself.....so if anyone can assist in the same way as Tracey has in the past with others, or if anyone knows her Reddit username (or any other methods of reaching her), PLEASE let me know as soon as possible by replying or sending a private message.

shorthand background::  i love opiates; for many years i was taking upwards of 150mg of oxycodone, which naturally created quite the habit/enjoyment of said chemicals.  mmm, i remember the pink dust well...  during this time i was **aware** that it was not good, but life was much worse, so boom bam boom there goes my early 20s.  

i stopped at 23, never went into withdrawl from a 100-180mg daily habit (AMA) but that is a different story... this one has a point.  

so here is the thing;; while i miss these chemicals **deeply**, i miss the life that i never had much more.  what i mean by this- even if i word to start up again, regardless of how fucked i could get there would always be that pit of **aware despair** inside - the pit that holds the possibilities of what i could do, could be and **could feel* ... 


 this is not a classic case of ""you were just ready to quit"" , as to this day i still dislike life generally, am always looking for an escape, am afraid of relationships being broken and ultimately still am equally confused as i was back then.  

for years i thought the chemicals outweighed everything- happiness, sadness, everything in between.  now i know they are so powerful, the most powerful,, but is the inner sense of lack of accomplishment, true excitement, true joy, true healthy relationships with others and with the self potentially more ""necessary"" to ones inner journey than to feel good???  this is tripping me out, idk.

I wanted to share a story with you guys about one of mine. This dealer is definitely a type of dealer you don’t usually come across and I guess you could say I lucked out. 


His name is Dan. 

My boyfriend and I met Dan a little over a year ago. Not last winter but the winter before. Boyfriend and I were on the streets, staying in hotels, or friends houses for a minute at the time. We were staying at our friend’s house, Louis. 

Now, Louis’ house was the ultimate trap spot pretty much. Louis’ Mom just recently passed actually and Lou’s brother is a piece of shit and sold the house so Lou had to move out. Lou actually got charged with ‘operating a drug house’ which I didn’t even know was a charge? His house was always a drug house tho. There were two buildings, 1 was the house, the other was the garage. Garage was where you would always catch people sleeping cause they had no where to go, or nodded off with a damn needle in their arm. Louis used to be one of our closest friends actually. Not too many people are trustworthy in the game, but he trusted us and same with him. 

Anyways, lol. We were staying in the garage at the time. This chick Brittany would always be there. She started selling us some black one day. Which was weird, cause she never had shit. She was basically sleeping in her car or at Lou’s or at another dboys house named Hawk. So we just thought it was weird how a bitch with nothing was selling all of a sudden. Figured she was middling or something. She tried acting like she was doing big things and shit until we found out she was just sleeping with/dating her dboy. One night she came over to Lou’s and she was telling me how she has to drive to X to reup. A few hours go by and she came back. She randomly just spurts out a question to me about reupping while her dboy is in jail etc etc. So that’s when we found out she wasn’t really dealing she was just sleeping with her dboy. Her dboy went to jail for something small and he was having her do everything for him to keep raking in the cash while he was in there. Thought it was hella funny how hard she was trying to stunt until she spilled the beans lol. 

A week or so goes by....and we hit Brittany up to pickup. She says yeah come to so and so hotel. We go and meet her and she asks us to take her to Safeway so we oblige. Drive her back to the hotel. I think we stopped staying at Lou’s or maybe not I can’t remember but we needed to shower really bad so we asked her if it was cool if we could shower in her hotel room. She says “uhm maybe. The guy I’m staying with will probably be okay with it. He’s just set in his ways ya know? Let me go ask” We start getting our clothes and whatever ready and she comes down and it’s cool but she warns us again “My dude is cool. But like I said he’s just set in his ways and can be hotheaded so just to let you guys know.” Were like okay whatever. Get up to the room and we get introduced to Dan. 

Everybody introduces themselves blahblahblah. 
Now Dan is not what I pictured when Brittany was talking about her dboy. Idk what I pictured really but Dan is just kinda funny looking hah. He’s 37-38. He’s maybe 5’7 with a really bad hunchback.maybe weighs 150. He’s white and has like gingerish hair. He reminds me of like an evil leprechaun kinda 😂 

So my boyfriend and I go do our thing together in the shower. Get out and Dan says he’d like it if we sit and kick it for a bit. Hands us some scratchers and tells us to scratch away. Throws down some black on foil. He’s cool haven’t seen his temper yet. He’s gonna go sell someone a sack downstairs and go grab a meth pipe from Brittany’s car. He comes back up and starts yelling about how he spilled root beer on him and they start fighting. So we decide we’re gonna bounce. It was like two weeks of drama after that. 

Brittany would hit me up to hangout cause she didn’t wanna be around Dan. Bitch about his temper. Pretty much just got her side of the story so she made it seem like he was a dirtbag who eventually put his hands on her. Last day I saw Brittany she was staying at Dans dads house with him. She had to turn herself into a program and was detoxing at the house. Dan asked us for a ride or two and bought some bars  from us for her. They ended on bad terms though. I guess she snuck into his dads house with one of her girlfriends to get her clothes and stuff and dans dad woke up and was like wtf. They took stuff that wasn’t even hers like clothes and shit but just totally out of pocket. 

That same week my boyfriend gets arrested. I was totally barred out all week on one of my Xanax binges. We were sleeping in my car at the time and idk why I was asleep in the backseat lol but that’s the last thing i remember. I wake up to my boyfriend saying “Wake up! Cops! Getting pulled over” I sit up really confused and I’m just like wtf where am I. “Where the fuck are we?! Babe what the fuck!! What time is it?!”  I’m looking out the windows, and I didn’t recognize the area. 


Turns out we were in a few towns over. Only like 20-30 minutes away from our city. Not far at all. It was like 5am when I woke up to us getting blurped 🚓. Reason why we were in this town was because I guess my boyfriend couldn’t sleep and he wanted to get a head start for that day to hustle. We usually go out of town and drive city to city to hustle. He boosts and we also do returns. Our city is just burnt. All the stores either, recognize my boyfriend, or they just refuse to do returns for anyone around here now. The epidemic is really bad here and all the junkies blew every store the fuck up and the stores caught on. So yeah, he was just restless and wanted to get an early start for the day so decided to drive a few towns over. He had a warrant out so that’s also why I was so upset when I woke up to that. Before the cop came to the car we told each other we loved one another he’ll call me blahblahblah. We don’t like to bullshit the cops if he’s got a warrant or cause we’re on probation. We just tell them before they run our names from the start cause it makes shit a lot faster and easier than playing dumb. Fucking cops gave me a ticket for not wearing a seatbelt. So mad about that. I was asleep and we were in a residential area anyways. They didn’t find any drugs or anything so no new charges either they were just dicks. Reason why they didn’t find the black was because at the time we had a silicone dab rig. In the bottom of the dab rig there was a built in silicone container the ones for wax and shit. Well we’re in Cali so cops never trip on our dab rigs when we get pulled over. But we had over a gram in the stash container and since the cops don’t trip on the dab rigs they’ve never even touched ours in all the times we’ve been pulled over. I was sweating so bad tho thinking they were gonna pick it up and inspect it lol they didn’t tho. 

Here’s where I start the whole reason why I started this story lol

So after the cops took my boyfriend and let me go it was like 6am. I’m still all confused at this point not knowing where to go. I texted Dan cause he’s an early riser. “Hey dude Justin got arrested and shits a long story but hit me up when you’re awake” He calls me like thirty minutes later and tells me which hotel he’s at and I swing by before he has to check out. I drive back to our city which isn’t far and make it to Dans hotel. We do a few dabs and I explain what happened. He tells me the falling out with Brittany yadayada. I guess she tried to steal an ounce of black from him when he was sleeping. He caught her. She threw an unopened soda can at his head and he pinned her against the wall. When she told me he put his hands on her she left those details out. 

A week goes by in a drug induced haze staying at Lou’s or in my car. I was also staying at one of our dgirls houses actually. She ended up doing me hella dirty tho so I left her place. We were like best friends and she was never untrustworthy at all. Her man went to jail too so we were helping each other out. She was basically getting me well and fronting me until my boyfriend got out. He only had to serve 2 weeks at that point. So she didn’t mind helping me. The falling out between us is another story tho. 

After I left her house I was in my car. It was raining and cold. I had just gotten caught shoplifting trying to make some money twice that week so I said fuck that I’m not trying to get arrested. I got lucky actually and the cops never came when I was caught both times. I was just down and depressed. Boyfriends in jail. I wake up the next morning sick af. Dan calls me. Asks me to come to his hotel. I’m sick as a damn dog and I’m just like yesssss thank you junkie gods lol. I arrive and he just woke up so he smokes with me. Asks me to drive him to the store in the new whip he just bought. He didn’t have his license at the time. I asked why he called and he said he remembered I was all alone in my car and shit and it was cold out. Dan is one of those people who doesn’t like being alone. Most addicts don’t like being alone actually lol. Dan and I kick it most of the day. He tells me I can stay with him if I want. He had the hots for this bitch Lydia tho and I just had to leave for a lil bit  when she got there. I happily took that offer. Idk how I get so lucky on getting the chance to stay with my dealers but I do lol. 

I ended up staying with dan for pretty much idk 2 weeks. Now whoever has stayed reading this long ass story is probably thinking “oh this junky bitch probably slept with him for dope” 
Dan is one of the nicest dudes I’ve ever met. He never once tried to put the moves on me. Never even made a flirtatious comment towards me. Mind you we barely knew each other for longer than a month. I think he could tell I wasn’t a druggie whore and would never cheat on my man. Dan and I slept in the same bed even. Idk why he never got a room with two beds but I didn’t mind because he kept his space and as did I. Sometimes I wouldn’t be with him when he checked into a new hotel or new room. Dan is one of the most hot headed people I’ve ever met. It’s cause of the dope cause when we’ve picked him up from jail and shit he’s not like that at all. But I would give him space when he would get real bad. Sometimes I would go run errands or go and hustle some cash too so it’s not like I was annoying and was just a mooch not leaving his side. 

He’s also one of those people that is never wrong. Like he doesn’t admit to his faults whatsoever. Don’t even try arguing with him. He doesn’t listen to anybody but himself most of the time. He has to be the one to think of shit first to even consider something even if you’ve explained something to him already. I remember teaching him how to dab black and he loved it. Told him to only use titanium nails cause it works the best with tar and yadayada. We were staying at a hotel that shared a parking lot with a smoke shop. He comes back to the room and shows me his new dab rig he just bought. Most cheap dab rigs only come with those dinky quartz nails and I explained to him numerous times before to use a titanium one. That same day his quartz nail broke and he was cussing and went to the smoke shop to get a new one. This motherfucker comes back with a titanium nail and try’s explaining to me that titanium is the only way to go and the best of the best cause that’s what the guy at the smoke shop told him. Smh I was like “you don’t listen to anything I say” lol anytime someone came over to buy a sack he would tell them about the titanium nail revelation he had and they would roll their eyes and look at me smiling. That’s just a mild example of how dan is when it comes to listening. Although, he never flipped out on me like he did everyone else. I think there was 2 times we got into a small argument but it was mild. He told me once “I don’t mind keeping you around for a number of reasons. 1) you’re not a fucking idiot like most of the people I deal with and 2) you’re not a damn junky thieving ass bitch” lol keep in mind I’m not trying to brag. 

We had fun though. He would have me drive his Mercedes to take him to go reup a few hours away. He’d have me help him serve sacks. Scratch scratchers. I met some people I’m friends with still. I’m just happy he didn’t ruin things by being a dirtbag and pulling some kinda move on me. The first 2-3 nights I stayed with him I was worried I would wake up to him groping me or something like that. Majority of dealers would’ve loved me staying with them but I wouldn’t have if they tried anything lol. It’s not like I’m ugly or anything either I mean I consider myself a good looking 21 year old. I also made sure I wasn’t cock blocking him. He never got any pussy anyways cause he’s gross. This chick that he’s still dating now would come over when I stayed with Dan for those couple of weeks but they fought like crazy so he never got any. 

When my boyfriend got released I went to pick him up that morning. Dan had to move rooms when I was gone but he got a room with 2 beds. Told us to stay there for the night with him. Thought it was kinda weird he didn’t do that before my boyfriend got out but whatever. The night after that my boyfriend and I got a room at the same hotel and told Dan he could stay with us. He did. The next day we had to check out and Dan lost his scratchers. He loves his scratchers and always has a stack of them. He misplaced them once and found them. Then lost them right when we were all packing up but he didn’t notice he lost them again until we checked out. Dan called me like an hour we parted and was cussing at me saying we stole them. I told him “Motherfucker you know damn well I didn’t steal your scratchers. You took them in the bathroom before you showered and that’s the last time I saw you with them. I’ll call the hotel and ask housekeeping.” Called and housekeeping said they didn’t find them which I still think they lied to this day. That hotel has lied in the past about not finding some of our stuff and we didn’t take them so housekeeping must have. Dan is notorious for blaming people for taking his shit even when they didn’t. That’s the only time he’s ever accused us of taking anything tho. He knows he’s wrong deep down but won’t admit it. I found out later by this chick Sam I met when staying with Dan that he would test me behind my back. Sam is also really close with Dan and he told her he would set up stuff up a certain way on purpose to see if I would steal. He always had a big silicone container that would hold an ounce of black in it and he would leave it out and put a small piece of paper in between the lid and container. If I opened it the paper would fall but I wouldn’t notice it. I never knew he did that cause I never once even thought about taking from him. 

Idk why I posted this long ass story really lol. A lot of us chicks have it a little harder cause dealers can be scummy. Dan was a rare guy and I appreciated him for that. We’re still friends. He’s in a program now. Some bitch set him up last year. My boyfriend almost knocked him out a few times cause of Dans mouth but anyone who knows Dan has had a similar experience with him lol. Another moral to my story is, if you’re not a thief and a cool person, and can build a friendship with dealers, they’ll help you out in times of need. Every time my man has gotten locked up I pretty much get taken care of. I don’t live in an open air market though. I’m sure it’s different around those areas. Also get tired of reading the same dumb shit in this sub. I don’t have hella stories to tell but figured I’d try lol",1522303254.0

For starters she's been shooting dope over a decade, is like 30 yro 5,8 , 125 lbs. lately when she does a shot it causes her to have a burning sensation throughout her whole body. She says it's like pins and needles X 100 and burns. It starts in her head and spreads through her whole body and concentrates in her head, hands and feet especially. She's a tough chick and she says it's so bad she can barely stand to do a shot so I know it's really painful. She doesn't do coke either. Just hair-on. I sometimes get a burning feeling in my arm further up from my injection site but figured it was from the coke and my veins being trashed. I'm guessing her issue is some kind of allergic reaction caused by the cut. That's just my best guess though. I've told her and her bf about this sub and how wonderful you all are and that this would be the best place to get answers. Tyvm in advance.

Back in the day she would ask me if I knew anyone who had perc 5s or shit to help her out - fast forward a couple years and I have been introduced to roxy 30s and i fucking love them. Same old shit as everyone else - tried them, like them, found someone who always had them, started buying small maybe like 2 a week, than 4 - than 8 and you know how it goes before you know it you're spending all your money on it. my mom and I have a tight bond - she always told me i could come and tell her anything, so when I told her that I was able to get these, she wanted some as well obviously. So we started putting money together to buy them. The habit was pretty bad about 2 years ago for an entire year - i was spending nearly every extra dollar I had on roxys. from about August 2017 to march 2018 I used, but not nearly as much - I sort of went back to chipping again.

Okay so long story short - I moved and my mother (who i assumed was a lil fucked up on xans) asks to use my car. says shes sober yada yada ya and just tired from not sleeping. 2 hours later I get a call saying she crashed my car. I was pissed. My family is aware that my mom has somewhat of a drug problem, but is in the complete dark about me. that day my mom crashed my car, she gave me $400 and was begging me to pick up some for her. I took the money but told her I wanted to stop doing them and that I wasnt going to buy them. So the next day I go to get my window fixed and just feel bad that my dad has to deal with this bullshit. my mom fucking up, wasting his money ect. i see the bill for the window replacement and its $400ish. what a ko-winky-dink. After waiting for it to get done and everything I contemplated hard, but figured my dad needed to know the truth. 

So, I went home and spoke to him in private and told him EVERYTHING and gave him the $400 my mom gave me. 

He was...understanding I guess. I told him that I wanted to get away from them (one of the reasons I moved out) and just stop using all together. He was obviously more mad at my mother for keeping such serious secrets from him yanno. He asked if I had a problem and needed help. I told him I really dont think I do have a problem, but than again I feel like every addict says that yanno. all he really said was to just call him if i ever get the urge to use or whatever.

Anyway - fast forward a couple months - i havent used anything in roughly 2 months. 

Just sucks because like I'm not ""craving it"" but thinking about it ugh, sorta makes me miss it

It honestly pisses me off how ineffective and expensive most rehabs are. 

For me they banned any prescription psychiatric drugs. No benzos for people with anxiety and no Ritalin for people with ADHD, but also no mood stabilizers or antipsychotics or even antidepressants either. So these geniuses thought that drug withdrawal was the perfect time to stop taking prescription psych meds.

They stuffed way too many people into one house. Five people sleeping in one bedroom. House has like 16 people living there and only two bathrooms. Thankfully when I came in I was the only one going through the peak of dope sickness, but crowding multiple dopesick people into 5 person bedrooms and having only 2 bathrooms sounds like a recipe for disaster (and lots of people pooping their pants or on the floor). 

They demonized weed like it was in the same class as heroin. One counselor tried to tell us that a kid jumped off a bridge because he smoked some weed and thought he could fly. If you smoked weed it was considered relapsing and the reaction was just like you shot a rig of dope. 

One especially stupid counselor did not even know what Immodium was. She did not even know it was OTC. Also when some Christianity talk came up and someone mentioned the Holy Ghost she literally thought it was a ghost like Casper or something.

Also the 12 steps and AA were always right and unquestionable. That shit was like a cult to them it was creepy as fuck.

It didn't really help the hot and cold flashes at all but it was so nice to not be flopping around like a fish out of water. Just spreading the information around since WDs are like fucking medieval torture. 

Some other tips Ive learned from experience.

DO NOT TAKE FUCKING BENADRYL OR ANY OTHER ANTIHISTAMINE TO TRY TO SLEEP. They make RLS sooooo much worse. The idiots at rehab gave us the max adult dosage of Benadryl before bed and I would always just be flopping around all night, even if my RLS wasn't that bad during the day. I didn't make the connection and just until I got home and slept just fine because I didn't have any Benadryl. 

Immodium is a great tool but DO NOT SUPERDOSE. There have been reports of people getting heart damage because they took like 10 times the recommended dose. I don't know what the safest highest amount you can take. I take around 20mg only if I know Im going to be super sick: no negative effects yet but it still.scares me to take that much.

1. Take H. Dissolve into a decent amount of water. Not TOO much but not as little as possible. Less water makes it harder to powderize. Ideally, after H has been dissolved, water should be gold to orange-gold. 


2. Get some foil. Warp foil to make it flat-ish in the middle and flip up the sides so that the liquid will stay in the middle and not go everywhere. The more H you used, the bigger the middle area needs to be but overall the more the liquid can spread out the better.

3. Take monkey water solution (the H water you just made) and drip it on foil.

4. Now this is where you can be creative. CAREFULLY apply a low source of heat to bottom of foil. I personally used a scented wax diffuser with the wax bowl taken off, essentially just a hot light bulb chamber with a nice place on top to rest my foil and goods. I've also used a stove on low heat, a candle, and no heat at all, just lots of patience.

5. Do not use high heat, honestly the longer the better. You don't want to toast your nom-noms.

6. After water has evaporated you should be left with a pool of reduced, hardened H. If you lightly poke it with something pointy it should produce a nice tap and bounce right off. If its not dry enough then it will stick to what you poked it with making a snapping kind of sound and you will have to pull back your pointy object a little. You want no stick, like you were poking hardened plastic.

7. Lastly, get a baggie that will fit most if not all of the foil inside. Take a knife or something you can scrape with and gently start poking and scraping away at the H. OR do whatever you can think of to separate the H from the foil, I dont care.




Now you should have a baggie full of feel good. simply crush everything inside up and you have BTH snortable powder without any added powder cut    :)


If you cant get some stuff off the foil then just add a touch of water and reclaim it as monkey water.

If some stuff isnt crushable or sticks to the bag then its not dry enough or too concentrated.

Lastly, I find that a little bit of the stuff usually goes a long, long way. So go slow, you can always take more later but you cant untake it, you know?",1522284151.0

A little bit about myself, Ive been a ""whatever opiate I can get my hands on"" opiate user for over 10 years and I am a grown man. One rule I have never broken, (but come very close to, especially in lockup for 30 days) no straight dope. I know Im probably kidding myself that pills are somehow a better substitue but Ive just always had a strong anti-H personal policy. My normal DOC is blues. I have a somewhat consistent plug that is just a friend Ive known for a very long time, her and her dad have a large monthly script that she unloads to people. I usually grab like 8 at a time for 25 per. I usually eat em and some times snort em, I dose about 60mg/day and if Im flush with a bunch I splurge and pop 3 blues a day, well maybe 4 haha.My one other friend that sometimes has them gets 15's and they're dollar for dollar mg's, theyre shitty white football pills though. He stopped getting the green's, I guess his medicaid will only pay for these generic ones. Whatever, they work but Id much rather have the greens. I used to drive like 2 hours north to a major east coast city where an orange cheeto currently resides to get a bottle of 500 hydros at a time from a guy I knew but he died from an H OD. So other than these two folks I have no sources which really sucks when its dry bc I have literally nowhere to turn. Currently pretty sick RN. I've never tried cold copping or asking for dope before. Prob not gonna try, called the methadone clinic thinking I might nut up and go in one day but I hide my habit and Im not trying to let anyone know about it.

It's a normal day in that I wake up, slightly sick but bearable, and do a combination of getting ready for work while texting my dboy what time I will take lunch today (I'm the IT department manager so as long as shits not hitting the fan or if the CEO happens to notice I can pretty much take lunch whenever and as long as I want).  So I say 10am and I'll be there for 1030 (half hour drive to his small City).

10am comes and we confirm and Bam I'm like a rocket on the highway.  He hits me with the ""I talked to him this morning, he's not answering but he will by time u get here"".  Instant anxiety attack. Keep my cool and eventually get to his house and find out he's still not answering.  I'm now freaking out with 250 in my hand and just praying to hear his phone vibrate as we sit in his car .  Sheer agony for 45 minutes.  No answers, no backups around, WDs setting in, and I know if I head back to my small city I won't be able to get back up there until tomorrow (Damn girlfriend's a hawk).

So in my desperation (I live a few hours from Philly, some small city's but not somewhere easy to cold cop like the big city's) I decide to drive around the shittier areas and pray we somehow make magic happen. 

Random black dude walking down the street, I'm like fuck it so we slow down and I behin. ""Yo man what's up"". ""yo"". ""Looking for H you good?"".  ""Nah man"".  Now this was discouraging as not only was it a failure but the scumiest dude I've seen on the streets we've been prowling just looked at me like I'm scum..ouch.

After 2 more similiar attempts down, I'm at that point where realization sinks in along with the depression and other FML feelings associated with it. Dboy says he's gonna drive me back to my car, fuck....

On the way we pass the projects and I'm like ""Turn in lets try one last time"".  Dboy don't work and I'm on break 2 hours now so fuck it why not. Sit in the lot for 15 mins or so and nothing. I see a black guy come out and smoke a cig . Fuck it what's the worst that can happen. ""Yo man what's good"". ""nothing man you looking for someone?"". ""Yea his name is H and I can't find him and I'm sick as fuck"".  ""Bro come in"".  Ok so at this point I have a huge fucking rush of euphoria at the possibility I will score my first cold cop, disregarding I'm about to walk into this dudes apartment with 250$ , but I didn't care at this point. I walk in and he has 2 fat chicks on the couch watching TV which for some reason make me feel a bit safer. He asks who's driving me I say it's my boy were looking and the situation. He asks if I'm a cop I say no but he continues to treat me as one, so I say bro listen I'm not fucking around I'll crush up some Xanax and do it off your floor, I'm just looking to get right and if you got it we can connect. 

He just says yea do that man.  So I'm a little confused but I'm like fuck it, I pull out my phone, crush 2 .5 xans and start railing away, as he starts walking into the kitchen they are gone. 

He asks how much dough I got, which I didn't want to tell the truth so I say 50 bucks. Now 50$ would typically get me like 6-7 stamps as bunnys go for 70-90.  He hands me a bun and I give him the 50 just like that.  

I go to my dboys car (who no longer is a dboy at this point hah) and I snort 2 bags and give my dboy 2 for driving around with me and shit.  Holy shit it's 10x better than I'm used to.  We both are listening to music driving around and are in the craziest state of bliss from a combo of the dope but also how we both thought we weren't getting shit. 

He drops me off and I pull away in my car and go RIGHT BACK to the dude's house and knock. He answers and I just smile and say ""I got more if u do"".  Bam 200$ and I get a house (Brick turned to brick House turned to house hah) AND score his number. 

Fast forward and my dboy is now calling me for his shit so I got a habit and someone who let's me get free shit like 5 days a week.

Thank God I said fuck it turn into them projects.

Wish my story was as well written and interesting as those I've read here, but it's the only one I got haha.

For try to chase the high both this times i tried to take more, around 1 month ago I took 40 mg and I still didn't had feel anything, 10 days after I took 80 mg(40mg swallowed+40 snorted at the same time) and I still didn't had feel any high.

I know that if u use them too much u will get some tolerance but I don't understand why I didn't get any tolerance in 3 years but now whitout using more mg or more often then every other times I got it. And sadly also 4x my usual dose didn't make me feel any high. I'm sad, anyways today are 22 days that I don't use it or any opiates, my tolerance should be again at the normal level when 20mg made me pretty high (not nodding, just feeling good) or is that feel lost forever?

Up until then I was just a pot head who drank some cheap booze at weekend parties and took some addies when I found them because they made video games amazing. 

Fast forward to when I was 18 and I started my career which was handed to me on a silver platter from my father. 

I started off on the shop floor at one of the home base operations around Austin. I was still using at a pretty recreational level at this point. 

When I turned 20 I got an opportunity for a road crew that went all over the world installing , fixing , and maintaining the machinery .. now this was a huge pay increase and god damn all that money coming to a 20 year old kid whose only bill was a payment on a brand new truck who loved to party was bad news. 

I got real heavy into the shit real shortly after that .. popping a lot of pills and snorting a lot of boy. 

I have always fucked around with other stuff .. I really love stimulants ... Molly .. drinking sometimes.  

But for me the opiates were the one drug where I could find that sweet spot where it literally made every part of my life more enjoyable .. work , video games , sex .. I mean everything. I was able to figure out what dose worked best for whatever situation I was put in. 

I feel like it's the one drug I could really fit into my life 24 hours a day .. I could just never figure out how to do that with anything else .. or never really wanted to anyways I guess. 

I went through withdrawals after I took my station here in the Midwest and don't have any connects for anything stable. 

So now I'm just chipping .. I doubt I'll ever be 100% clean because well I fucking love drugs.

As crazy and ass backwards as it may be, I have found that my life has continued to spiral out of control more quickly and more dramatically since trying to get clean! 

Granted, I lost a lot of things in my addiction. I lost countless jobs. I lost 2 cars. I lost my apartment. I destroyed my credit. I racked up $70,000 or $80,000 in debt- I stopped keeping track after a while. It took me years, but I did some major damage. I thought I lost everything, but I still managed to stay afloat by working a handful of hours per week at a job that provided me with a company car, and by selling an ounce of black every other day. The small amount of work that I did generated enough money for me to live an extremely comfortable life. I was living out of a hotel and I constantly had plenty of dope.

Things were about as good as they could get. I would have happily continued to live my life that way, but one very stupid mistake I made ended up catching up to me... You see, before I had started selling dope, I found myself doing some unsavory things to come up with cash. I was living in a trap house and the home owner (we will call this person ""B"") had this bad habit of stealing packages from locked mailboxes. B had obtained some blank checks from a mailbox, forged one, and asked me to try to cash it. Since I had been staying at B's house rent free, I obliged. It seemed like the right thing to do. The worse that could happen is the check being declined at the financial institution, right?

WRONG. 

Not only did the bank NOT accept the check, but they contacted the account holder and the police department. The account holder of course mentioned to the police that their checks were stolen from their mailbox. 

It was Friday when I tried cashing that check. By Monday I had a text message and a voice mail from an officer asking if I would be willing to meet up with them and answer some questions. Being the good junkie that I am, I decided to pretend that nothing happened, as if it might blow over if I ignored it for a long enough time. It didn't. 

About two months after the check cashing incident, and after a long day spent driving, I failed to use my turn signal as I made the final turn into a residential neighborhood. I pulled over, thinking about how pissed my boss was going to be that I got a ticket. It wasn't until the second police vehicle showed up... Then the third vehicle... Then the fourth vehicle... That it dawned on me that a ticket might be the least of my worries at that point. After what seemed like an eternity, I was asked to step out of the car and informed that I was a person of interest in a case and advised that there was a warrant for my arrest. (I guess that cop that initially made contact with me over the phone didn't just want to talk after all.) They handcuffed me and hauled me off to jail.

I spent the long holiday weekend (Veterans Day weekend) in jail. I began detoxing from heroin cold turkey for the first time in my life. I had the misfortune of being stuck in the ""detox cell"" at my local jail for my entire stay since I made the terrible mistake of telling the nurse at the jail that I'd be kicking heroin. (Word to the wise: if you ever end up getting arrested, you tell the nurse you're detoxing from alcohol and benzos in order to score librium. As awful as heroin withdrawal may be, it's simply unlikely to have serious complications; and with the opiate epidemic in America, cops have no sympathy for the large percentage of inmates who come in kicking heroin.)

After three very long days in jail, I was granted supervised release. Originally, it appeared as if I'd have to post $5,000 bail. Desperate to get out of there as quickly as possible, I called my older sister to see if she'd come and bail me out. My sister came through for me, but her help came at a price: I had to go to rehab. Given how dope sick I was, rehab didn't sound all that bad at the time so I went with it. My sister brought me to a detoxification facility the day after I was released from jail. Although the average stay in detox is three to five days, I spent eight days there and was rushed to the hospital on three separate occasions. I ended up having an IV line run through my jugular vein during two of those three visits. I was so ill during my time in detox that I don't remember any part of the eight day stretch I spent there.

After I was medically stable, I went from detox to a 28 day inpatient residential treatment facility. My senses had finally started to return to me. I wanted nothing more than to leave treatment, but since I was out of jail on supervised release, my sister told me that she'd tell my probation officer if I left treatment and have me arrested again. I stuck it out. In an effort to support me, my family offered to pay for my first month of rent at a sober living house once I completed treatment. I found an Oxford house to move into after treatment and gave sobriety my best shot. The only problem was that I wasn't ready to get clean. I did it to stay out of jail. I did it to shut my family up. I did not do it because any part of me wanted to get clean. I lasted ten days out of treatment before I relapsed.

Once I relapsed, I got kicked out of my Oxford house and moved back in with my parents after 9 years of living on my own. I did my best to respect them while I was there. I didn't use when I lived at their house. I kept things neat and tidy. I tried to be as invisible as possible. Unfortunately, that wasn't enough to keep the peace. My dad was never been able to look at me the same since finding out I'm an addict and he made it very chaotic and uncomfortable to be at his house. After about two weeks, my dad gave me the $750 that I was arrested with and told me I couldn't live at home anymore. I took that $750 and got the cheapest motel room I could find for a few nights and proceeded to spend every last dollar I had on dope. I ended up overdosing and being brought back with narcan two days in a row.

When the money and the dope ran out, I tried getting clean again. I detoxed in a hospital and went back to residential treatment. I completed treatment again, and this time, my boyfriend said he would have an apartment for us to live in when I got out. Only that didn't happen. We live in an area where there is a horrible housing crisis and it is damn near impossible to find an affordable place. The first available move in date for us ended up being April 1st. That left us with nowhere to go from March 14th until April 1st. We stayed in the cheapest motels we could find, but that just wasn't sustainable. By trying to keep a roof over our heads this month, we ended up blowing through the money we had saved for an apartment. We haven't even been getting high.

Ugh there's so much more and I could go on and on, but that isn't going to change anything. If you read through this, holy shit! If not.... Well I don't blame you lol.

TLDR; I quit shooting dope in an attempt to get my shit together. Shit just got worse.

Hope everyone has a great Friday today though!",1522424231.0

I actually wrote the below words to myself with absolutely ZERO intention of having anybody else see it. It was completely for my own self-satisfaction and expression, hence the writing style is slightly strange, and I haven't tried to write eloquently etc, but upon finishing I figured it maybe could do some good here.*


Every man or woman has their time. The age can differ. The state of one’s life can fluctuate. But everybody has their time. And it is here, at 11:48pm on the 30th March 2018, as I sit in bed with the lights off at the ripe age of 23, that I have reached my time. Time for a leap of faith. Time for me to take control of my existence, from the inside out. Time to rectify all the years of fucking about, in particular the last year. Time to become the person that I truly am. The person that has been there, waiting. Tucked away in a little box in my mind, completely available for me to become this whole time. All I’ve had to do, is simply choose to step up and be him. 



More specifically, it’s time to change the perspectives of the people I know. Through one thing and one thing only; action. Time to change Mum’s perspective of me. Dads. (Girlfriends Name). My friends. Time to play each role and satisfy each obligation from the numerous segments of my life. Via action. Time to go to (Girlfriends Name) house regularly. Be social, and develop a close relationship with her family. Time to see my friends. Have sober chills with them. Show gratitude for their loyalty, give to them, speak lovingly to them, become an important friend in their lives once again. By acting like one. Time to visit Nonna more, and Nonno. Time to work. Work hard, consistently, and productively. Day in, day out. Success will start to manifest. Time to be CONFIDENT. Rock hard, bullet proof confidence, from the core of the psychi, oozing out into the physical realm in my actions, words and movements. Think confident. Make those telephone calls with the big fish. Arrange meetings with the big fish. BE the big fish. Think BIG. Progress, develop, grow. No stepping back. Just forward. ACHIEVE your potential.


Be STRONG.  Do not fold in the face of adversity.  Challenges and struggles are to be expected, they are inevitable. You will be Depressed. Anxious. Weak. Tired. Careless. Reckless. Scarred. Tempted. Through it all, do not forget who you now are, what you are doing, and where you going. Now is the time. Now is the time. Now is my time. Now is my time. Right NOW. But there is one last crucial aspect, that is the most important of all. Taking every single thing that has just been mentioned into consideration. These traits can only be achieved, this time can only be seized, and I can only be the man I am supposed to be; if I do this one thing. One thing that comes before everything. One thing that allows for all of this to be possible. One thing that will either make or break my life. And if I can do this one thing, EVERYTHING written in front of me will be mine, I will have won, I will be happy and I will be in complete and utter control of my life.

I was feeling unusually cold hot cold hot cold and a pounding headache was taking over. I spent time at work using the rest of my gear. Turns out I had caught a cold. I got home only to realize not only had I caught a cold but I had also been withdrawing already. 
I took another shot that I scraped out of my container and felt not much relief as the headache was all I could focus on. I also had a fever, stuffy/runny nose accompanied by that familiar smell of sickness far up in my nose.


**This was my chance.**


I called out of work until Saurday just to be sure. Sunday would be Easter so I had no work. I wanted to use this opportunity to kick this fucked up habit that has consumed my soul, morals, love and outlook on a life without opiates. I was a user because of horrible pain in my back from some fucked up discs, scoliosis, but maybe even more of a user because of the soothing touch of opiates when it came to all of my everyday affairs and the emotions that go along.



Most of you reading this will be familiar with the horror that withdrawal is. For those seasoned veteran addicts who forgot or the teenage kids interested in raiding their parents' cabinets for some pills, just remember these words: vile smelling sweat, pouring out by the liter, every muscle tense, SO MUCH REGRET.

Its now Friday. My physical withdrawal has come to end. I sit typing this after a final night of sweating out the poison. Yet all I wanna do is lock myself inside my room, my private little place, and fly away  to outer space.


My out of state plug is coming to my city tonight. Told me all week how great this new shit is. I take his word for it, he's a reliable fella. I haven't got a dime though. I check my bank account just to be sure and I am blown away by what I find. A surprise direct deposit by my previous job on the morning that I've beat withdrawals.

What do you think is the best way to take them - how, how much, what should i expect?
I have no expericences with opiates (besides tramadol), however, I'm not the biggest fan of downers and stimulants are my cup of tea but since those pills were kind of sent by god i want to give them a chance :)

ive never gone through the pain med thing --- i only did the benzo thing and went to emergencyrooms when i couldnt get percs or oxy or w.e. (10 years ago)

i am honestly going to shoot for one of these three: xstampza, a tamper proof hydromorphone, morphine ER, or oxycontin 10mg



i dont want to mention oxy though i want to get around mentioning oxy infact, i dont even like oxy as much as other opiates.



i am ABSOLUTELY FINE with something tamper proof. infact, extended release is preferable. i am in considerable pain that is still progressively getting worse.


PS: I have a stash of Dihydrocodeine and Codeine,so getting anything at all would be fine tbh. but by the off chance that i am able to get a doctor to prescribe me a pain medicine for my extreme chronic pain, will they do an equianalgesic doseage for me?

i.e. if i switch from 1-4mg of bupe/suboxone to X of another drug
or switching from 7.5mg hydrocodone to 15mg hysingla

Also I'm making this because I can't really share all the details with most of my friends and also I don't want to annoy them by rambling about how great my girlfriend is. So anyways here's the rest of the post


So me and my girl have been going steady for about 4 months now, and before that we both had the biggest crushes on each other... like middle school level shit. My girlfriend likes to smoke weed and drink a bit, and she's going to try psychedelics this summer since she's never done them but wants to with me. Her mother struggled with drug addiction for many years, and they damage it did to her body is what eventually caused her to die when my girl was a young teen. So she's not cool with any of the harder shit I do. I've told her some of the things I did, and when we started going out I told her I used to do dope. She didn't freak out on me and she wasn't disappointed, but she did say if I ever do them again she will leave me. So I became addicted to dope around Christmas time, before that I was chipping. Once things started to get a bit more serious I started tapering down to quit without having withdrawals. And it was actually going really well and I was sticking to my  taper regiment. But then one fateful night I was pulled over with weed and because of that I'm probably going to be on probation for a year at least, 2 maximum. So basically I figured that I might as well do as much dope as I can before I'm forced to quit because of probation. Now she doesn't know that and thinks I'm still clean. So I feel like a piece of shit for lying to her like that behind her back every time I use. But my sentencing date is right around the corner so I'll be done with it soon enough. 

But yeah so besides that one little detail that she doesn't know about everything is amazing. SO here's the part where I'm gonna ramble on about how amazing she is in every way possible. Since I've been with her my life has been a thousand times better. She is such a caring, sweet girl who always makes me feel better when I'm down, and she always has a positive outlook on life which has helped me tremendously. I'm typically a pretty neutral/depressed person so her positivity has done wonders for me. She's also the my beautiful woman I've ever met. At first when I met her I wasn't that into her looks, like I could see exactly why people would find her attractive, but she just wasn't my type. But over time that changed and I think her beauty is second to none. And she's also quick as a whip, she's creditably smart and shes going to school for astronomy. How cool is that? I think its pretty neat. But she's also really funny, she has the same sense of humor as me. She's got all the same insecurities I do, we both hate ourselves, but love each other, and there's just a whole bunch of little things we have in common too. It's honestly like I'm dating myself lol. 

And holy shit the sex is honestly the best I've had in my entire life. We both share a lot of the same kinks too. And dat pusssaayyy...holly shit its so tight and amazing. Really fuego top tier shit. Nice and tight, tastes great too. I could eat that summabitch for breakfast lunch and dinner. And her sex drive is crazy high too. Also, atleast for me, when I actually love someone it just makes the sex soooo much better, and I've never loved someone as much as I love her. I was never the type of dude that could just sleep with a bunch of women. I mean it's fun and all but I really like having that emotional connection with someone yanno? So yeah best I've ever had.

Honestly even though we've only been serious for about 5 months, I got a good feeling about her....I think she might actually be the one as cheesy as that sounds. Obviously I'm gonna wait a lot longer before I'm absolutely sure of it. But it's not like any other love, this one is different because its us. I just love her soo very much. Like I've never felt this way with any other girl I've been with. The one thing that's really getting to me is my dope habit which I'm happily going to kick very soon. I've always quit hard shit any time I've been with a girl except this one time and its starting to get to me.

So yeah thats that I could go on for way longeer about how much I love her but y'all get the idea. I just wanted to make this post because I'm in a really good mood and just wanted to share this with someone, but I don't really got anyone to share it with...so y'all mfers are the next best thing. Man I really love her sooo much.",1522390644.0

Oxycodone, Codeine and Doxylamine","180mg Codeine - 25mg Doxylamine succinate (potentiator) - 5mg Oxycodone (snorted) Low Tolerance to all.

Snorted the Oxycodone once i peaked on codeine. Was pretty disapointed as it wasn’t as intense as people make it out to be. Anyways i lay down and try to get my nod on, i notice after 20 mins that I’m pretty sedated but wide awake. This is normal for new oxycodone users apparently. It took about 40+minutes to fall asleep, but a few minutes before that i notice i had extreme mental clarity in the sense that i could visualise people doing and saying things very vividly.

After falling asleep i entered a state of extremely vivid multi dream reality. My first dream involved millions of green insects that are poisonous and bite. upon hearing my fathers voice outside my own house i go outside and am instantly attacked by these poisonous insects. I end up dead in less than a minute, saw my own body dead on the front door step from a third person perspective. Then my dream sort of like 10x rewinded (I call this a dream reset) and I’m in a new dream reality.

This time Im being sprayed in the face with fly spray by my mother. I was punching her to fuck her off but she tackled me, held me down and sprayed fly spray into my face until i died. Once again third person out of body perspective upon dying. Dream resets and I’m in my own house with my friend who i do drugs with often.

Both my friend and i are aware that we are in some drug induced dream reality but we don’t know what drugs we took. We have a genuine sense of fear and adrenaline pumping through us as we try to open my front door which seems to be glued shut as is all the doors. “Fuck i don’t wanna die again dude” “Yeah me neither the fuck even is this” We go into my room, break my window and i jump out. As my friend goes to jump out the dream “resets” again.

It seems I’m at the “starting menu” of this game. I hear a voice of a dark entity say “welcome”. All i see is pitch black all around with subtitles of what the entity is saying to me. It is explaining to me that this is where you go when you fall asleep on a select few drugs. Which included a small list of drugs such as DXM, MDMA and various other psychedelics and RC’s. I am told my only objective is to not die, and that no actual physical damage is being done to real body. Dream resets…

Now I’m in this counter strike cross with prop hunt game. All i can do is stab, i have a heavy duty military knife, and im in my own house which is dimly lit. I hear some sounds from the hallway, i shout “where are you motherfucker”. Then this carrot comes racing at me and “tackles” me down and is inflicting pain somehow. I stab it, i think its dead. Dream resets “fuck man when does this shit end, this is fucking torture”

So now I’m in my dimly lit house, still unknown what drug is responsible for this vivid, borderline, nightmare. I walk into my bathroom to look in the mirror to check my eyes, maybe that will give me a hint as to what I’m on. As i approach the mirror, i see my own face for a split second and my vision gets extremely distorted and swirly, then a dark entity sneaks up behind me and kills me.

“The fuck i didn’t even get a chance”

The entity replies with something like “i do what i want, your trapped here until the drugs where off “fuuuckk”

I wake up, I’m pretty sweaty, its 5:30am still have an hour left so i try to go back and give this bitch entity a piece of my mind, didn’t work. But holy fuck this was INTENSE.

My sister ran through her script of percs she got from her surgery. My mom checked in on her and says ""oh, you ran out of Percocet? I'll get your refill tomorrow, in the mean time you can take some from my stash"". Now I'm sitting on the couch having a beer as she says this, and the moment she said ""my stash"" my mind immediately told me ""don't worry, there is oxy in this house"". Which was weird, because I hadn't thought about it all day, even as I saw my sister's script dwindling away as time passed me by. The fact that there will be more oxy here tomorrow comforts me further, but at the same time I can't sleep, the anticipation of digging into those bottles is nightmarish. Knowing that tomorrow, before my other sibling gets home, after my mom goes to the gym and after my father goes to work, and after my sister takes her Percocet, I will fiendishly dig through every cabinet in this house for fucking Percocet, its both comforting and unnerving. It's a damn shame really, after being clean for so long and relapsing recently with morphine, I fucking hate myself. But here I am awake, waiting. Waiting for another release. And it won't be my last, that much I know for sure. I guess I just want to say that I'm sorry. I've been an asshole, and karma has come to bite back.

I genuinely can't understand how no one else in my family sees a problem. When this bullshit began and she claimed my painkillers for herself because she was afraid I would kill myself (bullshit), i was under the impression she hadn't had painkillers prescribed to her in years, because she told me as much. She had gotten 3 full 30 day scripts for tramadol, hydro, and oxy. And she just recently came up with this delusional and clearly fake story about how she got prescribed codiene and she hid it thinking I would steal it and she hid it so hard she can't find it. She hasn't been prescribed codiene in years, but she was prescribed oxy a week before she started talking about this mysterious bottle of codiene. I don't even get why she had to lie about the drug name, she clearly gobbled the bottle quickly and had to lie to herself and me just to feel okay about it. This is just fucking sad. My advice to you parents is don't fucking steal drugs from your kids and don't let them see you so far in denial you can't fucking see straight.     
      
I'm leaving this place as soon as I have money saved, (let's not even get into the fact that she wanted my entire paycheck), but it's absolutely insane to me that she completely destroyed her relationship with me for a few bottles of morphine, a box of fentanyl, and a handful of oxy. She's still sitting on most of them, and she knows if she would just get rid of them I would let go of so much of this anger. Just fucking die or get help already, I can't watch this anymore.

I was a hardcore herion addict in my early 20s (30s now). Lost everything - family kicked me out, became a prostitute, lived with low-lives - everyone I knew was a felon. AND THEN. My main dealer went to prison and somehow I got clean. I went on to finish my Bachelors blah blah blah.


So here I am, with an amazing job making $90k/yr. in a nice area drinking from time to time but hadn't once considered going back. I have a horrible ""picker"" and tend to not go for the right guys. 


Some guy hurt my feelings and I started getting bars from his dealer to deal. Then norcos. Then percs. I was lonely AF and started fucking the married strung out dealer I was getting my shit from. On to opium with him. He felt bad about cheating on his wife, so he insisted on not kissing me. I talk to this guy every day and see him a few times a week. Have feelings for him. The no kissing and reiterating he has no feelings for me makes me feel worse. The last time I talked to him he told me he didn't consider me a friend then went on to detox on his own. He hit me up last Thursday looking for shit and I guess OD'ed badly that night. He's in rehab indefinitely ... I only know from a third party. I miss him so much IDK what is wrong with me.


I've been getting norcos and percs from his friend/another dealer. Got high and came onto him. He has a gf and will not cheat. I don't know what's wrong with me. I'm a good person. I'm up at 5:00 am to do crossfit for 1.5 hours every day. Then I work 9-10 hours. I have great friends and a family that cares about me. I'm a good looking girl. Right now, I'm high alone after work and feel like complete shit. I feel like the higher I get the more lonely I feel. I have 3 norcos left until I re-up on percs on Monday or Tuesday. I don't think I should be doing drugs. I just don't think I care enough to stop.

Turns out, I drive right by his crib pretty much when I go home to visit my parents.

A few weeks ago, I was heading down to visit them and my brother and I decided we wanted to try the dope where this fellow, let's call him Gollum, is at. So I shoot him a text, let him know what the deal is, and that I'd be picking him
up to go to the spot at whatever time.

So the time comes and I go scoop Gollum and he's acting super fucking weird. fidgeting in my seat and asking me over and over how many bags I want and yada yada. Gollum says we're going to his main go to go guy.  I have to give him 3 for his services, no worries I'm used to that shit. I tell him 15, for the 46th time, and he suggests that we buy 6 and then do them right then and then buy the other 9. I tell him nah, if this is his fault dude we should be  straight. it's an open air market so id rather get the fuck out of there. 

We get there after him giving me the wrong directions 90 times, and i drop Gollum off and I make a block. I see him hang ole dude the money and get handed something back, and then they go inside a building together and come out a few minutes later. Gollum comes back to my car and is telling me to go go go. he counts the bags out, and there's two different kinds. 6 (the same number he suggested we buy and do right away) are Nike stamps. The other 9 are plain bags. Something is fishy. he counts out his 3 (and drops one back into the pile) out of the Nike bags and gives the rest, 12 (3 Nike 9 plain) to me. A few minutes later he realizes that he only has two and asks me to count mine and see if I have 13, which I do, and he grabs his third, making sure it's a Nike bag. On the way back he shoots two bags and keeps telling me how he doesn't want any problems with me and is being super sketchy and rocking back and forth and kind of has like a childish temper tantrum when he can't register. He legit almost cried I think. When we stop for gas, I dump a plain bag on a foil and go to smoke it. stuff melts down like meth, but isn't meth. I call him out about and he says he doesn't know, they're real and i'm tripping.

Gollum then makes me drop him off at an overpass (on top of it), not close to where we met up. Maybe it was close, idk,the city i was in is huge and I don't know it too well. So I get home and my brother and I get to doing what we do. I do a nike bag, and i'm ripped. totally Fent, and i kind of knew it going in. He does a plain bag, nothing. does 2 more. Nothing. Shit sticks to the bag like wet flour. Nike bags didn't stick at all. He does a Nike bag, he's floored as well.

Gollum texts me a few times asking me about the bags and what I felt about them. I tell him they're fake and what not. He texts me again the other day saying ""I forgot to ask you, how were those bags?""

My question to y'all is:

Did the dboy rip US off and it was a coincidence that he grabbed all 3 Nike bags?

Did him and the dboy work together to rip ME off?

Did he rip me off alone, pocket the money, only buy 6 and had the flour (or whatever) bags on him already?

i'm torn between option B and C.

I've never been and never will be into dope, i prefer roxy/percs however i fuck with any legit PK (i stay away from oxy bc idk anyone i trust enough to not be selling press.) Used on and off since highschool (male, 21, 120lbs) , however for the last year ive been using steadily. Ive NEVER suffered any noticeable effects of withdrawal, nor became constipated or had fecal impactment. Well last month it has been hella dry, so i decided to try subs (like i didnt take any all of march). I copped 5 Suboxone 8mg sublingual strips. I took one and the euphoria was pretty good but i nodded so much i could not function, and i did the same the following day. I then could not shit for 5 days and felt so sick i had to do laxatives (didnt work), enema (didnt work), so i finally ""manually"" broke the fecal matter up and did yet another enema (was quite the experience). Perc guy finally hits me up and instead of just flushing and wasting the remaining 3 strips i took them over the course of 24 hours (8 hours in between each dose), 3 days later (today(EDIT: THIS WAS HOW LONG I WAS TOLD TO WAIT BY R/L ACQUAINTANCE AND WHAT MOST BUPE THREADS TOLD PEOPLE TO WAIT BEFORE DOSING ANOTHER OPIATE) i took 15mg of perc and to my dismay i felt absolutely no euphoria, felt a slight body high but nothing compared to what that dose wouldve normally given me. Now that story time is over what Im asking is will my opiate receptors forever be altered because of taking this drug? Im guessing they're still blocked but a friend of mine's father who is prescribed 8mg subs and still takes percs and oxy told me to wait 3 days before i pop any. I know Im a noob ive browsed some of the sub related threads here but didnt really find what i wask looking for, any insight would be greatly appreciated <3",1522525540.0

I got to the post office and anxiously ran inside to where my box is. Hastily opened it up to receive my package of joy and was instead met with the inside of a bare box.

FUCK! What am I gonna do? The post office closes early on Saturdays.

I went back out to my car and double checked the tracking. It still said delivered. I went back inside and checked my box again, still empty.

But... looking inside my box and I could see through to the other side, into the back of the post office. ""Hello? Can anyone help me?"" I cried out while praying inside that someone might be there.

All of a sudden I could hear movement in the back and a man's face appeared. He asked me what I needed and I explained the issue. He looked around in the back and came back empty handed. What little hope had built back up was quickly again fading away.

The man asked me what the tracking number is and I started to tell him. ""Oh,"" he said, ""it's an express package?""

I confirmed that it was and he pulled a package out of the box below mine. I almost cried with joy when I finally saw the familiar envelope.

I thanked the man profusely as he handed me my drugs and he apologized for their mix up. I ran out to the parking lot and started tearing into the package as I cruised down the street and found a suitable spot to pull into finally ready to mix up and blast off.

God damn mailman, I can only imagine what may have happened had my pack been opened by the owner of the other PO Box.

Finally at peace, for a little while at least.

Made a post about a month and a half ago that i was a weeks long sober. Fast forward to now...there were a couple slips within the first 2 weeks but now im just about at a month of complete sobriety (except weed) Im more or less feeling normal. I get a lot less sleep though...4-5 hours but it doesnt bother me. My biggest issue is that im bored. And ive turned into a serious fatass since my appetite came back in spades. Ive noticed whenever i would normally go take a hit has now been replaced with me opening the fridge and getting a snack or whatever. Anxiety is more or less gone. I get the small twinge here and there in my chest and immediately miss the dope...but i just grab some bud and smoke that and it more or less quells the urge and makes the bit of anxiety disappear.

I miss it of course. I dont know how long this will last. But for now i can at least relax on the daily and not have to go chasing every day. 

I still have not had my willpower tested in the sense that if dope somehow came to me if id be able to refuse. I doubt it if im honest...and we all know that is when free dope comes up most...when youre clean. So i guess we will see. 

And thats pretty much that.

But I've had my family find out because of my cunt girlfriend who shared my secrets.. Have my rich dad and uncle who don't help me with shit and I've made my own money and I'm in the top 5% of income earning in America, and the way people treat you when they catch you doing opiates is seriously fuked up.

Dr phil threatens all these users with sending them to jail by contacting the police or whatever if they don't choose rehab. Now I appreciate him offering free rehab and the best one at that. It's great. But first, fuk rehab they literally sink in this ideology that you're nothing but a pos weak person who will get better by accepting how helpless they are instead of helping them quit by realizing they are stronger and quitting by sheer determination, strength, and willpower... But ok enough of my rant let me get to my point.

Most heroin addicts id say almost all use the first time and realize they gotta keep using because heroin literally gives them some kind of fulfillment in life and or plugs a hole in life that they have. Usually it's because they aren't accomplished and or were hurt or realize no one cares about them so they try to avoid the pain and hurt by using. Meanwhile, Dr phil site there its a $50,000 Rolex on his arm and his own TV show where he makes hundreds of thousands per fuking show and doesn't even pay the people he helps with his own money, is worth hundreds of millions, and sits their talking down on people who are poor and have nothing and have tried and failed and sadly given up and thus use heroin to escape the shitty reality and plug the hole they have in their souls, minds, and hearts. Dr phil then treats them like crap, his show exposes and humiliates them on national TV for his own gain, he threatens them with police, and sends them to rehap which is shit and they treat you like you are so weak and are practically a nobody in life and a failure and need their help and their system to get clean.

What these addicts really need is to explain their dreams,and have rich Dr phil use that money wasted on rehab to help them out by funding  their career. Fuk Dr phil, instead of $100,000 on cock sucking rehab put $50,000 in their fuking cryptocurrency investment so in 3 years they're worth half a million or more. Tell them what business they dreamt of or fund them if they want to be a singer or actor and help them with that. Buy them a house by placing a $60,000 down payment and a nice car and help them get a HIGH paying job that they can pay the house and car off. Don't fuking waste it on pos rehab. These people need a career and a goal in life accomplished and they need friends and family who are always there making them happy. If they are given even some partial wealth from Dr phil and the house and car and most importantly the great job, they wouldn't even think of heroin or opiates and wouldn't even use even if you put the drug right in their face because they'd be a million times happier and have the root of their problem and the whole in their life plugged and fixed and theyd really be thankful then and happy and Dr phil could monitor them like that and he'd find out they aren't using. Instead they send them to rehab which obviously they'll come out and there is still a chance of using. 

Fuking can't stand when people who are rich and have everything love to gloat and boast and put people down and not give them the REAL help their hearts need ans instead waste it on fuking rehab instead of buying them a career and a place to live and nice car to drive so they could be happy. Dr phil could buy the property and car under his name and when they prove themselves they're clean he'd transfer the house and car to them but no, he fuking sends them to shit rehab which isn't gonna fix the root and cause of the problem.",1522522728.0

I'll take like two or three hot baths a day when withdrawing, pretty much feel 90% in the bath at peak, does wonders for stabilising temperature, chills and aches. **But an equally awesome modification** to hot baths is when you're done; get up under your shower head, do some quick psychological preparation; accept youre about to be freezing, turn the knob all the way cold and flip that MF on full throttle. Yes it's going to be freezing, but it's only intollerable when you fight the cold, if you accept the sensation and don't resist it's a pretty awesome rush. Try stay under it for a minute or two. Truly accepting the act is very doable, you just have to do it, a bit of odd breathing due to the cold-shock response but when you're done it does fucking **wonders** for your mood and energy levels. Like a hit of super clean coke haha. I really recommend this combo.

Until a little while ago, though, I wasn't very concerned because it seemed the subs that were getting banned were mostly justified from breaking site wide rules like doxing or brigading. But the ban of r/shoplifting hit a little too close to home.

It wasn't a sub I frequented at all, but in principle it was similar to r/opiates and other drug related subs. It was discussion of an illegal act, but not illegal in itself. It seems they were banned just to get rid of such discussion which makes me think the admins are going to come after us next. 

Several ignorant asshole users even suggested that they ban us next after the announcement. And now that r/darknetmarkets is banned too, it's not a big step to take.

Am I just being paranoid? I really hope so. Would be great to hear from the mods opinions on this.

I've been sober for about a year now, but this sub still means so much to me, it helped in harm reduction while I was actively using, and it gave me a place to express my self in that I couldn't do anywhere else.

In a perfect world, the Good Samaritan Law would have the capacity to prevent both the victim and the reporting person from facing any legal repercussions when medical attention is sought after there is an opioid overdose. Unfortunately, the Good Samaritan Law (which varies depending on what state you live in) may only grant you immunity from facing some aspects of certain criminal charges. Sound like a mess? It is. Keep reading for some specific examples.

In most states, immunity *does not *offer protection related to crimes involving the **sale, distribution, or trafficking of controlled substances. **

When it comes to crimes of **possession of controlled substances **only 23 states offer immunity from arrest, 30 offer immunity from charges, and 32 offer immunity from prosecution.

When it comes to receiving immunity from arrest, charge, and/or prosecution for **drug paraphernalia possession **crimes, even fewer states offer these protections. Specifically, 16 states offer immunity from arrest, 19 offer immunity
from charges, and 25 offer immunity from prosecution.

Let's say that you overdose or need to report an overdose for a person that you have a no contact order or restraining order against... *Only 8 states *provide immunity for protective/restraining order violations: Arkansas, Georgia, Hawaii, Mississippi, Montana, Nevada, Tennessee, and Vermont. 

Here's another scenario: You could overdose or need to report an overdose that might put you in violation of the terms of your parole, probation, or pre-trial conditions. *Only 18 states *provide immunity for supervision status violations: Arkansas, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, North Carolina, New Jersey, Nevada, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Vermont, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia.

So you might be wondering how you can report an overdose without having police officers sent to the scene. What I was informed to do is to tell the 911 dispatcher that you need medical attention for someone who has stopped breathing. Do not say ""they overdosed on drugs"" or say they will need Narcan administered. When the first responders arrive (ambulance or fire department), you can let them know at that time that they are dealing with an opioid overdose. 

There's plenty more state specific information on the United States' Good Samaritan Laws. Follow the link below for more information.

I am not a newbie when it comes to opiates. Taken M30's before and NP14's before. That's the only opiates I've had the chance of trying.

I actually have two NP14's and one M30 on me right now. 70mg. Can I take them all today? Throughout the day? I know I shouldn't mix with benzos but I've had oxy and xanax multiple times but never on this high combo. So might just stay away from the benzos today if I'm taking the oxy. 

The thing is, can I take 70mg? Not in one go obviously, like one M30 now, then two of those NP14's a couple hours later. I'll be smoking hash throughout the day as well. 

Is that too high of a dosage? I'm 5'8/5'9 and I'm 400lb.

Codeine seems like a tricky drug..,"So I do know codeine is prodrug, and *HAS* to be metabolized by the liver into morphine for it to work and what not; and how potentiating with grapefruit juice, dxm, etc.. doesn’t quite work the same because it blocks the metabolism of codeine into its active metabolites like morphine and a few others... and is it true you can’t redose on these and get high? This is my first time with 100 Tylenol 3s in my hand.. I usually would do 100mg of Oxy to feel social, slightly noddy, feeling open and nice, but with this it all feels just a bit sedating or it may be in my head... give me some tips (mainly an Oxy/morphine oral user) on how to get the most out of my codeine..

TL;DR: first time with a ton of Tylenol 3s (100), mainly would use 100mg of Oxycodone to feel nice, codeine works a bit different, how do I get the most of these and actually feel a high and not a placebo?",1522455093.0

She was really happy. It was great to see her. She admitted she's been on heroin lately snd asked uf she could do a small line. I said di you. She would have anyway, she just would have snuckoff to the bathroom instead.

We were laughing and suddenly she stops talking midsentence... ""C are you okay?"" She still had a smile on her face. ""C. C. C wtf are you doing are you fucking around?"" Her eyes roll back. She slumps back into my bed. I jump over, stradling but not on her. I'm shaking her and dialing 911. I don't stop shaking her. I don't know CPR what the fuck do I do shit shit fucking shit.

I dial 911. I don't listen to the voice ""I need an ambulance at x location my best friend is dying she's ODing"" i hear the voice. ""Calm down, what is your name?"" WHAT THE FUCK DOES MY NAME MATTER SHE'S DYING ""A"" 

""A, is your friend breathing?"" 

""No."" I say to dispatch. I say my address again? Twice maybe. She keeps fucking asking. I've said it right every time in between my pleas of C to wake the FUCK up already. ""Come on C you're okay baby come on it's okay breathe C it's okay help is coming help is coming"" WHY THE FUCK DON'T I OWN NARCAN? ""Ma'am is your friend breathing?"" C wasn't but at that moment takes on deep gasp, dispatch hears her ""Okay A. That's a good breath, help is almost there. Keep her alive."" I don't know how to keep her alive. Keep her alive? I barely keep myself alive. But okay. Keep. Her. Alive. 

""It's okay C it's okay"" I don't stop shaking her for a single second. I finally run fast down the stairs when I hear pounding. They beat my up the stairs going the wrong way. ""In here she's here"" They rush to my room and kick me out.

I'm sitting in the hallway. I hear it all but only remember some. It was a blur. ""We don't have a pulse."" Someone started CPR. ""What is she on?"" I scream from the hallway ""She needs narcan!"" 2 officers appear. ""Where are the drugs. How much did she do? What was it?"" 

They pick up a jacket and purse, ""Is this her stuff?"" I say yes. They pull everything apart. They find a small white bag. ""She needs another narcan"" they gave her another shot. I see her sit up, giant gasps for air, coughing and convulsing. She was alive. C was alive.

Cs eyes open wide. She looks for me but only finds a cop in her face, explaining to her that she was dead for a minute. She's scared and won't speak. The police ask me to come in and ask her to say what happened. I sit on my bed and hold her hand ""I'm sorry I had to call but you were dead, C. They're going to help you now. But you just have to tell them what happened"" C looks around for a sec. She lays her head back. ""H"" she mutters softly. The paramedic stutters ""yeah that's some heroin..."" was it fent? It was probably fent. 

The paramedics took her to the hospital but she was basically okay then minus the severe PAWS. She's alive. Her mom cried and thanked me probably 50 times for calling for help in time.

I never knew what I would do, put in this situation. It feels good that I know I did the right thing, I just know the road ahead for C is going to be rough. I stayed with her at the hospital until 5 in the morning, she finally told me to go home and go to bed for work today. I love her and I'm so glad she's not dead. 

Please stay fucking safe guys. 

P.S. also it was at my house and I played dumb the whole time and they honestly believed me when I said I had nothing and I know that I shouldn't gaf about this but I'm so glad they didn't rip my room apart and take my stuff. ",1522449085.0

I recently have decided to take a break from using. Needing to get some things in order in life, I was far too deep into addiction and fucking up my life. 


My questions to everyone here is, do any of you experience dreams revolving around using your DOC? It has been more nights often than not I dream about using or a nightmare revolving around a deal gone wrong or something. 

Example: one recent dream involved me running around listening to a plugs bullshit (nothing ordinary) and in this dream after finally meeting up with the connect I don't actually get to use the drug in my dream. Something happens and prevents me from using it, or I wake up right before I'm about to push down the plunger or something.

These dreams have been difficult to deal with, however since I am nearly 20 days clean I want to keep riding the wave and get myself back together. Also, I still miss oxy basically every single day",1522448015.0

Started w/hydro, ended up with ordering fent (hcl) of the dnm’s and making nasal spray.  Got up to a roughly 25 MILLIGRAM a day fent habit.  

Can relate to those stories about “life not getting immediately better” once you quit.  Took a really long term rehab program for me (7 months).  

I’m still employable (professional type guy), though recently lost my first prof job since being sober to a non drug related, crappy type deal.  I’ve lost so much to opiates.  Wife divorced me in rehab even though it was my first attempt, and I really embraced the program and wanted to get clean from day 1.  That was heartbreaking. 

Been dating a little bit even though I’m still so in love with the ex. Due to the job loss, in conjunction with having a decent prof skill set, I’m really thinking about pulling up stakes and moving somewhere “off the wall.”

No clue why I’m here.  Love the stories, and for those of y’all that also are losing so much to the drugs right now, know that my heart breaks for y’all.  Like I mean it really does - I visualize both the cool stories, and the sad ones. I laugh with y’all at the cool stories, and send prayers on the sad ones because it’s all too raw and familiar still after over 18 months. 

For those with heavy habits like mine, know that it takes A WHILE to “think straight” again.  For those still using, please be careful. The thought of losing another soul - and it’ll happen before I hit send here - to milligrams of a powdery substance is sickening.  

Lastly, no matter how far you’ve fallen, I PROMISE you that if you put your mind to it, you can crawl out of the rabbit hole.

Love y’all, and be careful. ",1522445931.0

I was running out of options one day, my refills for oxy 30’s, Norcos’s and somas were a week out, I was broke and needed a fix. Having bad back problems at such a young age(24) I’ve always found it easy to get what medicines I’ve wanted, and have been in pain management 4+ years. I had been many times to ER faking back pain to get a shot of Diladuid and Valium, but after 4 visits in 6 months I didn’t wanna raise red flags but had to get high and my paycheck was over a week away and refills not ready. I went in complaining of extreme bladder pain, I even lied down on floor in ER and fake cried with eye drops with a dash of salt mixed in bottle. They rush me back there and I tell them I believe I have kidney stones. The nurse asked for a piss sample, and when I went into the bathroom I pulled out my trusty old syringe. Looking up the symptoms online, I saw pee in blood is a big indicator of kidney stones. So I filled about 1/4 of my rig full of blood and mixed enough into my full cup(ofcourse yelling-trying not to laugh at how absurd this situation was in bathroom as I went. I  looked in mirror and noticed bags under my eyes and I was sweating, definitely looked the part.) Anyhow, I mixed a very small amount of blood into my pee in the cup and gave it to the nurse. After a few tests and the seeing doctor, I’m hooked onto an IV for dehydration and that ever warm and lovely 4mg diladuid shot, usually they do 2 but doctor put order in for 2 because height, weight and tolerance for pain management. In his eyes, I’m just a 24 year old with “kidney stones” and was given 90 Percocet 10’s for the extreme discomfort I had coming... quite the opposite actually. I played the guy like a goddamn fiddle! Just wanted to share just one of many over the top charades I’ve put on to continue obtaining real pharmaceutical narcotics.


TL;DR- instead of faking usual back pain, I went to ER complaining saying I had kidney stones. During per sample, I suck blood into syringe and mixed a small amount into my sample to where it was noticeable but not obvious. Walked out a 24 year old with “kidney stones” and 90 Percocet 10’s richer. Share, comment or just laugh at the lengths we’ll go to to get a little high.",1522442624.0

I’m clearly not from here but haven’t been fucked with. I’m also rather large and probably wouldn’t be someone you’d rip off unless you felt lucky)


is dope supposed to reak of vinegar? Most recent stuff I copped is dark dark brown. Stinks of vinegar, and has much less in the bags but packs a longer lasting body intense punch.. the original bags were a grey white powder that had a slight vinegar taste and also landed quite long but was more euphoric. The dark brown is a body high and something I want to feel thru my body, the grey makes me chatty and hyped. Dno what is better Dope or which is closer to real?

The guy with the dark brown said his is off a brick. For reasons I won’t get into too I totally believe him as dumb as it sounds. His also takes half the powder for same effect. Just a much stronger body high than euphoric chatty rush. 

Any thoughts words whatever is appreciated- this is literally my first month after 10 years of use to try dope. I don’t mind it, sorta nice. It’s cheap. Harder to ration but cheap and fun. Less intense comedown for sure!! 
happy holidays to all. Hope JJ blesses you today.

I've been eating opioids daily for the better part of the past 8 years. From 400mg of codeine per day to 800mg twice daily at some point. When OTC codeine was banned in my country, I switched to morphine for a couple of months and then to 600mg of tramadol for the past year.

I took my last pill exactly 1 week ago. I went from 600mg to 400mg to 100mg over 3 days. On the 4th day, last Sunday, I ate an old and disgusting pill of 20mg of codeine that I had spat out behind my desk months ago. -_-

The reason I'm writing this is because something weird happened. I didn't start withdrawing like I normally should.

It had happened once before. A couple of years ago, I threw up, felt the most horrible pain and learned the next day that my goldbladder was fucked and needed to be removed. I was completely out of codeine and in no condition to drive, so I had to quit cold turkey.

Not withdrawing after quitting cold turkey was very puzzling. I was in so much pain from the dying goldbladder that it felt like my brain was doing me a kindness.

On Monday, I started getting quite sick and assumed that I was withdrawing. It became clear very quickly that I had actually caught a bad virus, possibly the flu, as my mother was suffering from the exact same symptoms. My mother and I are still sick one week later, however, I didn't crave tramadol and I feel like I was spared again.

What gives? Does this happen to you? Should someone who wants to quit cold turkey do it when they're already sick?

I'm planning on staying clean for a while, but I don't feel like abandoning opioids. I can't get anything legally anymore. I'm used to cheap or free opioids and I need this habit to remain affordable.

I have a Volcano vape from when I thought that I liked weed and I was wondering if vaping heroin with it might be an option. It seems reasonably safe since I would be inhaling the heroin slowly from a large bag. I feel silly asking if it's even possible to vape heroin. Any thoughts? If it's an option, how much heroin would I need to vape to feel what I usually felt with codeine or tramadol?

I'm good right now, but I'm sure that I'm going to want my happy place back at some point. Pills are either too expensive or unsafe, injecting heroin is out of the question, having to smoke it would be a bummer, but vaping out of a bag slowly is really appealing for some reason. Would unwanted fentanyl be a huge concern in this case?",1522601428.0

Been on an outpatient sub program (one visit/ua a month) for a while now. Decided to jump back on to my subs cause of a couple reasons. Money and being a stone. I’ve been way behind on my financial shit lately. It’s been really fucking stressful. Plus I just don’t have emotions anymore. Just feel like an emotionless pit all the time. Finally feeling positive about getting off dope for once. All the other times I’ve done it out of necessity and other people wanting me to get clean. This time I’m ready for a while. My girlfriend and I are doing really well, supporting each other through all this shit. AND OH FUCK! I forgot about music. How good music can make you feel and singing can heal. Idk guys. Haven’t posted or even been looking at this sub for awhile now, but I still been doing dope the whole time.

Anybody else just sit around and watch movies when you’re trying to get off the shit? I’ve watched 5 movies in the past day. I Don’t Feel At Home In This World Anymore, Moon, Moonwalkers, Suicide Squad, A Perfect Day, and right now I’m watching The World Made Straight. All really solid movies. Moon really fucked me up actually. A film from David Bowie’s son (Dune), it’s about isolation and manipulation. Sam Rockwell talks to himself and Kevin Spacey for 2 hours. Reminded me A LOT of 2001, but it was right. 

Anyway idk why I’m even posting right now. I guess ultimately to say it always gets better. Fuck suicide and wait it out. It always gets better.

Sorry about that. Every time I tried to dedicate some time and effort to you guys another shitstorm popped up and tapped me in the balls. Been too busy trying to stabalize myself in an environment/situation who's core concept is instability in absolution to actually sit on my phone. For the past like 3 or 4 weeks. 

I'm homeless with a roof over my head. I bounce between some very kind people I know and usually don't stay in one house 2 nights in a row, for some reason I feel bad if I do. The place I'm at tonight is... available under uncomfortable circumstances. It's a whole family that lives in this middle class home, and as long as I can reliably sell quality heroin to the mother and quality meth to the teenage daughter I can stay over whenever, come and go as I please and ask them for transportation support, food, money, whatever I might need help with. It's kinda dark and backwards I think but it's working out alright so far. 

My second main stay is a house governed by one of the most tamely twacked older women I have ever met. She's 55, does a shit load of meth and heroin, always gacked, always up to something impressively product, leaves the house maybe once per month (not kidding), and operates under one of the most respectful, kind spirited and genuine ways of being I've had the pleasure of witnessing.  My plug also recently moved in there, with his children and ex girlfriend. It's an interesting flow of interaction throughout the house. 

I've been learning a lot lately. I learned that people aren't as bad as I thought, I'm just too fuckin cynical. Had my faith in humanity restored after having myself and 2 backpacks full of clothes, cigarettes, writing supplies and solar panels thrown out of a truck at 12:10 AM. It was only 4 hours before I had fallen asleep in my hometown, then woke up in the back of a truck about 170 miles from where I fell asleep. No phone. Thanks, guys. Thanks. Trust is so rare and valueable around here you can't even fall asleep with other people around. Because, ya know, they'll put you in a truck and mob you to the farthest farming community, BumFuck in NoWhere County, throw you out in the middle of the night without a phone. Good fuckin morning, fragile situation of mine. How should you be nursed?

Attempting to quit heroin for the second time. I’m actually doing better than I expected, but some depression is creeping in. I tend to daydream/fantasize about things and then when I come back to reality it’s not nearly as cool as my fantasy and it makes me super depressed and shitty feeling. I know I should stop doing that but I keep doing it. Does anyone else do this or am I just weird?

Anyways. I know this isn’t opiatesrecovery, but I wanted to ask here because y’all tend to be pretty wise when it comes to this stuff. I’ve been trying to get some weed to help me along as I quit. I have Xanax and Kratom but I usually smoke weed too (helped a lot last time I “quit”) and I’m fiending for it right now. The only two connects I have are away for a few days. 

SO I went on whisper, which has worked for me in the past for weed at least. Two people seemed legit until they started saying that instead of cash, I’d need to buy a gift card to exchange for the nugs. Wtf? The excuses were: 
1. Boss doesn’t trust us with money and has some gift card laundering scheme BUT same person was like “oh next time around it’ll be different and you can buy straight from my boss” (??? Like what? Just like that one purchase and I’m in with the “boss”? Didn’t add up to me. Told that person to get lost.) 
2. “It sounds weird to people who are new at this but it’s just for anonymous reasons” ... again what??? Cash is pretty fucking anonymous. Again it doesn’t add up. Haven’t told them to fuck off yet, kinda wanted to see if anyone else has ever encountered this?

Any of y’all have thoughts here? Am I paranoid or does this seem weird? I can’t figure out exactly what kinda scheme they’d be pulling on me but I’ve just legit never had a dealer want a gift card over cash before so I’m sketched out. Thanks fam, happy nods & happy Easter :)",1522593620.0

I am thoroughly an addict, and will abuse just about anything to the point of psychosis or overdose, but I have the balls to admit that I did that because I love them. In reality, it's because my brain is hardwired to love them, just like some people get their fix on shopping, gambling, pigging out on food, playing video games, or being angry.

I've been 5 months almost 6 clean, and I'm as hopeless as they come. I would hate to use again just because of the pure torture of cravings. Yes, the withdrawals are just the body begging for more dope at any cost, but the mental cravings that one more shot, line, or hit will be better than the last gets me... Cuz only death will bring me the high I want! Into the gates of insanity and death I will use, I'm sure some of you understand, and honestly I find a bittersweet beauty in that mentality we share.

I just turned 20, and even though a lot of people can start popping oxy's, then snorting, then smoking or snorting tar, and then shooting and drag the fun out for years while remaining ""functional"" (aka not robbing people and selling and still working a job), I just want to say that we are all the same inside.
I was reading a statistic, and out of over 300 California men taking part in a longitudinal study on heroin addiction over 30 years, only 50% survived. By the end of the 30 years, more than half of the surviving were drinking, smoking weed, using heroin, meth, coke or a combination... leaving about 5% clean. And honestly... Probably only one or two of those clean were happy, not even going to go into those using drugs and alcohol in their 60's.

Today was the first day in 6 years that I didn't grab my pill bottle before I left the house and stash a couple of oxies away in my change pocket for when I would eventually need them. Today everything smells more intense, light is brighter, color is more vivid, sound is crisper. I'm feeling everything completely differently than I was before.

The last 2 months of tapering have essentially been one long period of extended withdrawals, but I've been able to go to work and deal with the majority of the symptoms with Loperamide, Gabapentin, Modafinil and Trazodone to sleep. 2 days ago at 1 PM I took my last dose. A quarter of my 15 mg Oxycodone sublingual. At 12 hours later everything hurt, but nothing so bad I couldn't cope with ibuprofen and acetaminophen. 24 hours later I was yawning a lot and sneezing 3 times an hour with tears streaming from my face. All the stuff that gets dulled by the meds over years of use are all turning back on full force and driving me crazy. Oh and my libido is back like crazy. My wife said I seem like a completely different person. No afternoon nap, no lethargy, no waiting for my meds to kick in before we go out to do something.

As for managing my back pain and sciatica I've been stretching a lot and visiting a chiropractor / physical therapist. I'm also going to give acupuncture a try here soon. I know I'll eventually need an opiate again in the future, but now I know that one can lead to two and three and before you know you've spent most of your marriage living with someone who relies on a daily dose of opiates to not be completely worthless. I'll be honest with my provider and work with them as they best see fit to manage my pain. Just no more damn long term opiate scripts. I'm frankly exhausted by the thought of the last 6 years. I will miss refill day and laying down being warm and fuzzy from popping a few extra. I won't however miss rationing the rest of my shit out for the month to stop myself from getting sick though. Done.

I love you guys. I've lurked here and posted occasionally on this and a few alts. This community is awesome and feels like a family so I wanted to share with you.",1522552417.0

Boom, cold turkey quitting off would kill me. I went to sub clinic and was on suboxone for 6 months 18 mg a day.

The mental side effects of suboxone were unbearable because I have pre existing depression and GAD. I found a new doc and again went on oxycodone (chronic pain). I quit sub cold turkey off 18 mg and never felt any buzz nor euphoria from oxycodone again. It\s been 2 months now and Im on fairly high dose, it helps for pain alright but because the depression is so bad I wish oxy gave me some buzz. But no, zip zero nada.

I was told it will take a few weeks until suboxone ""unblock"" my mu receptors completely but I have a feeling I will never get it again. I never tried weed until I was on suboxone (tried to help depression and anxiety) but weed did nothing except made me 100x more depressed and messed up.

I have an amazing relationship that has lasted over 9months (starting when I dropped the mild crutches like gabapentin/etc) with a girl I intend to marry and had found peace inside for the first time in my entire life.

Then I started drinking and taking kratom.. then smoking weed and whip its..
Then I did dope mixed with coke three times three days in a row. That was last week. Haven't done it again since but I'm addicted to kratom.

I'm extremely disappointed in myself. She did the drugs with me. Both of us really want sobriety or at least not to be strung out.. I never cared until about 9-10 months ago, but now, for I want to be totally clean again. Or at least just smoking weed.

I'm doing very well in most areas too, I'm financially relatively stable and I'm  independent, bout to start a job that I'll make much more money, have picked up my old hobbies again and I'm generally quite happy.

I began tramadol use in 2003, when I was 15, and it has continued. Last October, my doctor wanted to begin one urine screen per year before he would continue renewing my tramadol script. I simply walked out without going to the lab because I would have tested positive for benzodiazepines. 

I haven't really been ""clean"". I have used kratom daily, which has been a life saver and I actually do consider it to be clean time...maybe. It definitely does not provide euphoria like the stronger RX, RC, and illegal opioids. I'm a kratom advocate for sure. It has allowed me to remain free of tramadol. Kratom should remain legal, and I've read many success stories regarding opioid replacement/maintenance, and getting off opioids completely. BUT...

Thing is, tramadol cravings began to creep up. My doctor hadn't heard from me for months. I brilliantly dreamt up a scheme to try out. I called the office, saying I was down to just two tablets per day instead of the original prescribed  four per day, and wanted to know if I could have sixty tablets for just until my next appointment which is in late April. I was expecting ""NO"", but two hours later the pharmacy calls with a finished script. Therefore...my first use, and binge of tramadol in 5 months! Please account that I have been using this substance since the year 2003. 

The doctor will likely bring up urine screening at my next appointment I'm sure. I am not using benzos, but I am using the thieno, Etizolam. And daily cannabis user at the moment. I could stop cannabis now and probably be clean by later this month. It seems to clear out of me quickly. 

I feel like such an idiot, though. This little 60 tablet binge isn't going to last long, and tolerance is still an issue after 5 months! Proof to me that kratom keeps cross-tolerance with regular use, unless you begin weaning kratom - which I have not. During my 5 months off tram, and on kratom, I did notice my morning withdrawal symptoms before dosing to be less pronounced. 

I never thought I'd say it, but getting these 60 tablets, and beginning my binge I was so excited for....I think I may actually prefer kratom now. Crazy. It's even more subtle than the tram. And the tram has been a part of my life for 15 years. ",1522695118.0

I've always read about the lowest of an addicts life and what got them there, and now I'm living it.
So I share my ""tale""..

So,
I'm a cake decorator (peep my post history--my cakes and my job is all I posted about for awhile)
And I worked a REALLY CHILL job for four years. I managed to maintain being an undercover addict throughout my entire time working there 
(Heh, so I thought)
I'm good at what I do, its artistic and creative and for awhile it's all I felt I had. 
Until I got called out as an addict and fired. 


So the first three years I worked there, I was on strictly subs. Looking back, I was functioning like a normal adult.
I was kicking ass at work and making cool cakes, saving up SO MUCH MONEY.
And then about a year ago I made the ol switch a roo to hair-Ron 
And my life spiraled so quickly out of control.

The saving up SO MUCH MONEY part--yeah those paychecks all went towards my one way ticket to a fucking junkie hell. 

I had literally saved up $4000 and by may last year I had spent all of it (I started doing h in late march-little under 2 months).
So yeah back to work--

Within a week of using h, I had become physically dependent (that or I was going through sub withdrawals which is probably more likely) but either way I continued to use to avoid withdrawals.
Infact basically my entire usage is to avoid withdrawals. It's not really for pleasure anymore. 
I don't get a rush anymore. What the fuck am I even chasing? 
It doesn't even make me feel normal! (Sorry--a tangent) 

So once I started coming to work on h, it would noticeably started wearing off every 6 hours.
I would get clammy and my pupils would dilate. I never ate so I was always dizzy. And my cakes would get sloppy. I'd shake so my writing on cakes looked noticeably different.
I gave up on the subs. I was determined I could keep this junkie act up. 
But atlas,
Co workers started catching on then, but I played it off like I was getting sick with lymes disease (I've literally pulled this at every job I've worked--always to cover up my addiction) yet..I kept going on, 
I was still respected. In fact that summer I got a $2 raise 
(Yay more money for heroin! -__-)

This last winter shit started getting real bad.
I was running out of my paycheck by the third day, 
And my tolerance has skyrocketed due to fent/dope and i was at a $100-$200 habit a day. $70 minimum--and even that wasn't cutting it. 
Me and my boyfriend became pro schemers and I crossed the line--
Started stealing at work.
$5 here and there..
$10 one day
$20 the next 
Then $30 at a time..

It got bad. It felt so wrong every time and I was in constant fear of getting caught and called out, but I played it off. 
No one said anything.
I would space it out, like once a week, twice, if it was a bad week. And I told myself I'd only do it when nothing else was an option. 
(The things we convince ourselves) 

Fast forward 6 months..
2 weeks ago..

I worked that Thursday and I noticed the manager was acting weird towards me (we were super cool and he was my age so we were more friends)
But I didn't think anything of it. He's moody. Whatever.
Worked my 10 hours and right as I'm cleaning up, the manager calls me to come upstairs to the bosses office. 

My heart sunk.
I knew it before it even happened. 

Here. I'll paint you a good picture; 
I'm walking up to my bosses office with my face beat red and my heart racing so fast I can feel it in my throat. 
I walk in and there she is, sitting at her desk with her head down, and my manager is standing facing the video monitors. He's watching a video of me going into the tip jar early morning--three days prior. 
I'm like frozen. I don't even know what to say. I just close the door and plop down on a chair they had laid out and just admit defeat.

""Yes, that's me..I did it""

""I have a real bad drug problem""

""I did it out of complete desperation, as my addiction has gotten so out of control. 
It's so bad. I can't even function. It has a hold of me...

I need fucking help""

I'm like bawling, and to my surprise they start comforting me. 
At this point I feel like the biggest piece of shit ever. This isn't fucking me. Stealing measly tip money to fund a god damn slow death!! 
Ugh I start getting so angry at myself. at this point I'm just waiting for a cop to show up.
To my surprise, they don't call the cops or take any action, other then just simply firing me and telling me I need to get clean.

It hits hard. I had known how bad I was getting, but yet I just kept doing it. This is no surprise.
I was expecting it. 
heroin turned me into such a different person, I don't even know if there is an ""old me"" still in this god forsaken shell of mine.
I'm crushed. This is two weeks ago and I'm dealing with it poorly. As expected. 
This sounds corny as fuck but like making cakes was the only hobby/job that I could do that kept my attention and interest. 
It gave me a small ounce of happiness and I took pride in it. 

When I made the slow conversion from an addict to a junkie I told myself ""well least I have a cool job and I make cool cakes""
Ugh. 
I have no choice but to get clean. I can't find this habit. 
This demon costs too much to keep feeding.
Fuck me. 

This hurt to type. I'm not even looking for any type of response, just needed to let it out, ya know? 

Tldr; I done fucked up and lost my job. Don't do heroin, or like opiates in general.
This shit really does change your fundamental morals and being. 



Edit: oh forgot to mention--so when they called me out, they had said that it was obvious I had a drug problem because in a single shift (like every shift) My demeanor would change drastically (you know, the shit would wear off FAST) 
I would slow down and get sloppy. I would struggle going into the freezer and was ALWAYS wearing my sweatshirt (bakeries are hot af to work in--this was probably so stupidly obvious to anyone who knows what to looks for) 
But not only that, they had known about ALL the times that I stolen from the tip jar. 
(That thing would rack up like $100 a day, so I figured if I didn't get caught the first 20 times, they weren't keeping on eye on it)
Nope. Wrong. They knew every time. They had me on camera. Every time. 

So for the 5-6 months I was doing this, they knew and never called me out on it. 
I was baffled. 
And the reasoning?
They liked me so much and felt so bad. They knew I had a problem but didn't know how to intervene. 
They day they fired me, my manager-friend felt enough was enough and that it was time to intervene. 

I would have kept going, and they would of let me. That some how makes me feel even shittier.
These people were so kind to me. And worse, they still see the old me in myself. They can differentiate between me and the addiction. 
But I can't. I just feel like a junkie.

It has also been reported to increase the pleasurable effects. The method consists of simply co-administering naltrexone at an appropriate dose with opioids. I have read that other antagonists produce similar effects.

My research indicates that dosages used range from 1 mcg to 20 mcg of naltrexone per dose (orally). For example, someone taking oxycodone 4 times a day orally would simply take 10 mcg (or 1 mcg on the low end up to 20 mcg on the high end) of naltrexone along with each dose of oxycodone.

This is my understanding of what I've read.

Naltrexone is prescribed at 50 mg per day as an opiate blocker. My understanding is that this is massive overkill and that it actually only requires 10 mg to block opiates and that it probably only takes 10 mg to block opioid effects completely. 

So, 10 mg is a blocking dose of naltrexone. 10 mcg is an ultra low dose naltrexone dose for reducing tolerance and dependence and increasing the efficacy of opioids.

To go from 10 mg to 10 mcg is a factor of 1,000. (10 mg equals 10,000 mcg, to go from 10,000 mcg to 10 mcg you divide by 1,000.)

For buprenorphine, I believe 16 mg is a blocking dose, ie it blocks the effects of opioids completely for at least 12 hours or so, just like 10 mg of naltrexone.

So, assuming ""blocking doses"" and ""ultra low doses (that produce those effects of reduced tolerance and dependence and increased efficacy of opioids ie get us higher)"" are proportionate among these drugs (naltrexone and buprenorphine), I did the simple math...

(10,000 mcg naltrexone blocking dose) / (10 mcg naltrexone ultra low dose) = 1,000

(16,000 mcg buprenorphine blocking dose) / (x mcg buprenorphine ultra low dose) = 1,000 --> x= 16 mcg buprenorphine ultra low dose.

There are 8,000 mcg of buprenorphine in the standard 8 mg strip. 16 mcg would be 1/500th of that. You would have to dissolve an 8 mg strip in, say, 100 mL of water, so that 1 mL was 1/100th of the strip, and 1/5th of a mL (ie 20 ""units"" on a standard insulin syringe) would be the amount you'd use.

Now, that's the end of the story with Subutex or any preparation that contains nothing but buprenorphine. But, most of us have much easier access to Suboxone. 

1/500th of an 8 mg Suboxone strip would also contain 4 mcg naloxone (2,000 mcg naloxone / 500 = 4 mcg naloxone), which is quite possibly also clinically relevant, since 2 mg Naloxone IV is a pretty strong blocker, **but if you used the ultra low dose buprenorphine with naloxone (Suboxone)10 sublinguallyget around this issue.** On the other hand, it may actually be helpful if using IV, it may add to the efficacy of the method... Or maybe you'd have to adjust the dosage downward since the Naloxone and buprenorphine would have additive or even multiplicative effects with each other.

So, does anyone think that this could work?

I am pretty sure I can get either one in the street eventually, but getting subs is one quick phone call away any day of the week and with the popularity of the naltrexone ""pancake batter"" shot in my area, people on the pill are very rare.

And, now that I think about it, the same thing should be true of anyone coming off of buprenorphine!!!!

I have been free from the needle since November 21, 2017. So far it has been a crazy ride. Before I got help I felt completely lost. My boyfriend went to jail, I was homeless, and I couldn’t go 24 hours without shooting up. Every day was a struggle. I’d scam, steal, and hustle to get my fix every fucking day. On November 20th I shot up several fent-pressed blues, and then woke up 7 hours later. This scared me into getting help. I told my mom everything. I went to a clinic, and got on methadone. I know it’s not for everyone, but it has /literally/ saved my fucking life. 

I feel like a person again. I can actually see the big picture. I am no longer seeing through the lenses of addiction. I am learning so much about myself. When I was an addict, and even in early recovery, I just blamed everyone else. I directed my self hatred onto those I love. For the first time in my life, I am truly changing, and working towards being a better person.

Tomorrow, I start my first “big girl” job. It’s a real 9-5 job in an office. 6 months ago, I never would have believed any of this would be possible. Of course I still crave and struggle. Life isn’t perfect, but I am able to cope rather than shooting a pill to numb it all.

To everyone still struggling, it is possible to quit. You do not have to stay chained to the opiate merry-go-round. You can get off the ride. I love all of you, and if anyone ever needs help, I am just a PM away. 🌈🌼🦋🖤",1522640047.0

Pretty sure actual locations arent allowed, but the caps were all triple O caps that were either $5 or $6 a cap. Names were Gotti, Power (been around since 2014 and its not the old power that was real dope), and Lex Luger. All the caps were all white throughout - you cant see *any* color variations. Youd think youre getting beat buying straight quanine upon inspection.

Power and Lex luger are sold at the same corner.

Note: Gotti ($6) is dangerously potent. Im a vet when it comes to dope. I used to shoot half grams of that grey , tan and brown rock raw heroin that used to be prevelan around the city. Literally 3 key sized BUMPS. or matchhead size sniffs and i overdosed and was brought back with 4mg narcan. 2 key bumps and im nodding bent over at a 45 degrees. This was literally 2 hours ago..

Be fucking careful with that shit. 

Power: $5 all white fluffy standard scramble. All these scrambles look the same btw. 3 key bumps and im bent. Dangerous. Would probably OD off a fourth of a cap.

Lex luger: weakest of them all but still, DANGEROUS. 1/4 of a cap and im bent. Id imagine 1/2 a cap wouldve had me overdosed


This is coming from a typical IV user that still has a huge tolerance. My girlfriend with no tolerance has been puking for 2 hours off a bump the size of this O and nodding face.

Effects are all the same and all last about 2-3 hours tops.

Please be careful copping any scramble in baltimore. Had i shot any of these id be dead.

Sorry for taking so long to reply, but many subreddits were banned due to promoting illegal activity such as the buying, selling, and consumption of illegal drugs. Your subreddit was not banned due to the current opiate epidemic we are experiencing and the valuable tools that you offer that save lives. Compliace with this new policy is mandatory and there is a grace period to allow you guys to make the necessary changes and get your subscribers made aware of it.

This is almost surreal typing this. 100 days ago I was on the brink of going to the psyc ward because my anxiety and depression from quitting was through the roof. I didn't think I would ever be able to be clean since I would always relapse a few weeks into being clean. Since then, I've completed 3 semesters of college with a perfect 4.0 gpa, and got a pretty decent paying job. All my debts are basically gone. I've done a complete 180 with my life, and I feel like heroin is finally a phase of my life I can put in the past. I have no urge to use, and the cravings have all but gone away. I visted my friends mom not knowing my friend was finally bailed out of jail. He had dope and pins right in front of me and if i asked he would give me bags, but I didn't have any urges to use. I used to come here and get jealous seeing the pictures of peoples cops, but now I almost feel bad for people in a way because they are still sick and suffering. At my worst, I was doing a brick of ECP a day, so as you can see this is a huge accomplishment for me.

Moral of the story is that as cliche and corny as the saying is, it really is possible to get clean and change your life and it does get alot better over time. I don't really go to NA meetings anymore, but I am going to start going back as it does help to have a sober network of people you can count on.
