ev10m,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/ev10m/my_story_and_why_im_quitting_an_opiate_addiction/,15,https://redd.it/ev10m,ihateopiates,"My Story, and why I'm quitting an opiate addiction today.","My Story: I was 10 years old when I had my appendix removed from a 72 hour rupture. I had an incompetent child physician that insisted the intense pain I was feeling was just stomach cramps and growing pains. I fell into a coma during 5th grade science and came pretty close to death. 

Because of this, I was rushed to the hospital and underwent an emergency appendectomy. I woke up in the hospital in a ton of pain a few days later. I ended up spending 6 weeks in the hospital and my weight plummeted to 66 lbs.

This all comes rushing back because my wife, sons, and I were at my parents for Christmas and the story came up. They still had the hospital bill: it was over $45,000 and took them 11 years to pay off. I took a look at it and one of the bullets on the bill was:

(135) 100mg Demerol, $45, $6075

Wow. Over $6 grand on meperidine. I can distinctly recall how absolutely fantastic it was to get that shot every four hours. I'd sit in bed, watching the new movie ""overboard"" with Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russel over and over and laugh and laugh. I remember learning how to game the system, too. When nurses would change over from shift to shift, they wouldn't communicate the last dose. If I was good, I could time a dose right before shift change and then get another immediately after. Soon, it became a contest to see if I could pull staples out of my side and show the doctors and nurses how much pain I was in (my young mind equated bleeding with pain, more blood = more pain.) I probably only needed to be there for for 3-4 weeks and ended up extending my stay purposely.

I also remember how bad it was when I got home. I remember the puking and the sleepless nights and the intense cravings. I absolutely can't imagine what a twice daily H user must go through.

After that, my little nerdy ass researched the piss out of what I was given. I found the term ""opiates"" in a medical encyclopedia at my library and wrote down all the different variations. In my early teens I was always the ""good kid"" and the overachiever with perfect grades. Secretly I would always raid friends and family members medicine cabinets for codeine and norco whenever I had the chance. I was never caught.

Every time I could get my hands on a opiate, I took full advantage. The addiction was always a secret from my friends, my wife, and my kids. When I was 32, I heard about Kratom on a forum and decided to order a bag.

Nine months later and I was up to 30 grams per day. I make really good money so it's never raised a stink. I've tried to quit a few times and I can deal with all the symptoms except the sleepless nights. I always end up panicking and taking a small dose to sleep, sticking to that for a few days, then upping the dose like a jerkoff.

I recently scored some hydrocodone and I was able to drop the Kratom completely by taking 25mgs of nocro 5/500 per day. 2.5grams of daily paracetomol use, though, and I can feel my liver under my ribcage. Still, I know better how to deal with Hydrocodone withdrawals and I'm hoping the Kratom symptoms are over. I just banned myself for TOS violations from every Kratom vendor under the sun (seriously, it took me like 6 hours) and I flushed my remaining bag as well as the last of the norco. It's Sunday and even if I wanted to, I couldn't get any opiates until at least Tuesday. In order to quit, I need to force myself through this. Wish me luck.

Sorry for the rant, guys. This is a dummy account. I've never actually typed that out and it makes me feel quite a bit better. Opiates can be evil when you let them get out of control like I did.

ex8ea,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/ex8ea/strange_effects_with_oxycodone_on_withdrawal/,6,https://redd.it/ex8ea,priest,Strange Effects with Oxycodone on Withdrawal,"I found that when I took Hydrocodone, I was having difficult times sleeping, with restless nerves going off around my body. Luckily, I discovered the cure in Tylenol PM pills, which I then could wean myself off of. I swore that I would never take Hydrocodone again. The drug was like a wonder drug, though. It solved a lot of my problems, which were night-time sinus issues, grogginess getting up in the morning, a resistance to athletic stuff, and a lack of focus during the day. When I was taking Hydrocodone at night, I found that my sinus issues went away, I woke up alert and excited about the day, was focused during the day, and even got back into athletic stuff. However, when my prescription ran out, I was truly addicted and was having trouble kicking the habit until I discovered the trick with Tylenol PM tablets. Thank God for those, or I would have probably had to go into drug rehab.

So, when I had gout again, I asked my doc for an alternative painkiller, and he gave me Oxycodone. The strangest thing about this for me, though, is that I have no physical addiction to Oxycodone, just an emotional one. I found I can skip weeks without Oxycodone, without withdrawal symptoms, but tremendously enjoy those soothing nights when I am on it.

Others have mentioned that Oxycodone is far more of an opiate than Hydrocodone, so therefore I would assume be harder to kick the habit. But I did not find that the case. Meanwhile, I found that Hydrocodone was far stronger to me than Oxycodone. On Hydro, I fall asleep and can sleep through a train wreck. On Oxy, I can actually resist sleep for several hours and then sleep soundly, but not as strong as when I was on Hydro. However, Oxy has this soothing, warm effect that Hydro didn't have.

**tldr**: Unlike what people have said about Oxycodone being stronger than Hydrocodone, and have mentioned that both pills are hard to come off of without serious withdrawal symptoms like restless syndrome (arms or legs) -- I did not find this to be the case with Oxycodone. I can start Oxycodone and quit cold turkey without issue. But Hydrocodone is so powerful to me that I was briefly an addict. I guess from this I just want to know why it was so much easier to stop Oxycodone than it was Hydrocodone?",1294321571.0

I'd be lying to myself if I thought this time was permanent, but I at least wanted to share something I did differently this time - modafinil. 

Backstory: The worst I’ve ever gone through was 8 days of physical withdrawal from a 3x OC80 a day habit. Sure it’s not as bad as 6 bags a day, but it sure as hell left a lasting impression.

This time it was 60mg of hydro daily for 5.5 months. I’m on day 3 off right now, typically the worst for me in terms of psychological withdrawals. I’m using all the usual things: ambien to sleep, loperamide by the gallon, magnesium for RLS, vitamins and water. I heard about modafinil from a few user experience posts on opiophile and found an overseas vendor. 400mgs per day just about takes away psychological dependency completely. It doesn’t do shit (ha!) for the squirts or RLS and if anything it makes it a little harder to fall asleep (thank God for ambien), but it takes away 80% the cravings (and the chills for some reason).

Is it the prescription free end-all-be-all miracle subutex? No, but it helps tremendously with the mental side. Just thought I’d share.

Take N-Acetyl-L-Cysteine to rejuvenate your liver. It's used medically and is available OTC!","N-Acetyl-L-Cysteine (NAC) is an antioxidant Amino Acid and precursor to Glutathione and is given to patients when being treated medically for Acetaminophen overdose. It is standard medical procedure (i.e in an emergency room). 

Glutathione conjugates are involved in the detoxification and metabolism of acetaminophen and is reduced heavily when too much acetaminophen is taken. Normally, acetaminophen is safely metabolized, but if too much of it is ingested, or it is ingested in normal amounts over long periods of time, Glutathione status is reduced. N-Acetyl-L-Cysteine produces more Glutathione in the body and thus allows for acetaminophen to be safely metabolized. 

Now, I'm not saying that you can safely take 10 Vicodin at once with an N-Acetyl-L-Cysteine supplement and not worry about it, but, it does help protect your liver. If you take medicine regularly that contains acetaminophen, you should think about picking some N-Acetyl-L-Cysteine up from your local vitamin store and taking it regularly. If you do so, you will decrease your chances of damaging your liver. 

There are a few N-Acetyl-L-Cysteine supplements that are in time release formulations and are excellent imo. 

**EDIT:** Just to be clear, taking a few N-Acetyl-L-Cysteine tablets isn't going to save your life if you are taking enough acetaminophen to undergo a massive overdose, but providing you aren't taking more than the equivalent of 8-10 Tylenols, you will benefit from taking several (not just 1 or 2) N-Acetyl-L-Cysteine supplements a day. Don't go thinking you can take 3 N-Acetyl-L-Cysteine tablets with 15 Vicodins or Percocet and have no danger of toxicity. ",1301204609.0
gc9t2,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/gc9t2/my_kratom_advice_for_those_going_through/,22,https://redd.it/gc9t2,DevoretOpiate,My Kratom advice for those going through withdrawals,"Firstly, for those who don't know, Kratom (Mitragyna Speciosa) is a legal plant (in most of the world) that contains alkaloids which when consumed bind to opioid receptors in the brain and is thus a great thing to have for opiate withdrawals or for recreational usage. 

There are various types of Kratom, each containing the same alkaloids but in different balances. Depending on the balance of said alkaloids, Kratom can be more of a stimulant with little or no euphoria, or can be more relaxing with decent euphoria. 

The vast majority of people agree that the stimulating kinds of Kratom (i.e Thai, Indonesian, ""Commerical Grade"") are much, much LESS desirable for treating withdrawals and can in fact actually be problematic. Conversely, the more relaxing/euphoric types of Kratom (i.e Bali, Malaysian, Sumatran) are much more effective in treating withdrawal symptoms and feel much more like an actual opiate than the stimulating types. 

Personally, a very good quality Bali Kratom is the absolute best I have used for treating withdrawal symptoms and for taking recreationally. Some people like Maeng Da in this regard, but imo it's a strong half/half effect mix of stimulating and relaxing effects. Bali is the best imo because of it's tendency to be the most relaxing, euphoric and cheap price wise. Green Malaysian is also a great choice. 

Anyways, I figured I'd write this up because I know quite a lot of people personally who absolutely despise the stimulating type Kratom strains for treating withdrawals. This is also the same thing I've read in countless places across the internet. 

As a last note, please don't think that stimulating strains like Thai are worthless, as a lot of people very much enjoy taking Thai for recreational purposes as it can give one a desire to work. It's just not the best choice when it comes to withdrawals and euphoria. I'm hoping that I can save someone the annoyance of deciding to get some Kratom to help themselves out and realize they picked the wrong strain for their purposes. 

**TL;DR**- If you're going through withdrawals or want a more relaxing/euphoric experience from Kratom it's likely you'll be much better off with strains like Bali, Malaysian, Sumatran as opposed to the stimulating strains like Thai and Indonesian. 

**edit:** ""Toss and Wash"" is the best way to take Kratom and it simply means put some Kratom in your mouth and swallow with water or juice. Best thing to do is put the Kratom under your tongue initially and then put some liquid in your mouth and try to swallow all the Kratom at once in one gulp. There is an art to doing this, and it takes some getting used to. Some people gag their first few attempts, it's only natural.

**edit:** Can't believe I forgot to mention this... always try to use Kratom on a COMPLETELY empty stomach (literally nothing in your stomach whatsoever) as it's most effective this way! If you feel nauseous after dosing on an empty stomach, eat lightly until the nausea is eliminated. 

**edit:** If you need to know some good online kratom sellers, please PM me. NEVER ever use iamshaman ever! They have been known to mix in lots of Kratom roots into their powdered Kratom leaf. Fuck that shit.

**edit:** I guess I'll post a couple vendors publicly afterall... **KTBotanicals.com** is truly one of the best sites around (search for ""Kratom"" in their search bar). They have excellent regular green-veined Bali as well as a large variety of other strains and everything is guaranteed high quality. Their extracts are 100% legit as well, which is more than I can say for the majority of other sites. Some people say anything more than 20x is bullshit, but that's very incorrect and dependent on extract process and alkaloid balance. If you try their 50x you'll be impressed. Also, **loveleafgarden.com** which is unfortunately closed temporarily has excellent Kratom (ESPECIALLY their Super-fine Bali and Super Green Malaysian imo). Loveleafgarden has a few links to other sites to use that they can personally vouch for until they get back open and I'd imagine they are good quality being that loveleafgarden is most excellent. IMO, just keep an eye out for when they re-open and use ktbotanicals.com now :)",1301191837.0

I quit two weeks ago today. checked myself into detox. it helped me to detox/withdraw. but no one who wants to quit should have to be exposed to a script for this when they leave a detox center, doctor, etc. 

suboxone is a dirty little secret IMHO and is backfiring badly. I was on it for a week just quit 48 hours ago. every hour since I last took it has been better than the last. as the good feeling you get from it is fake and made me feel like recovery had not yet really started. 

Anyway I just want the truth to be out there...or to be 100% honest what I feel is truth.  FYI - I won't be baited by trolls but if you want a response to how I felt I journaled most of it as text messages to someone else that I met ""there"" that wants to stop after being on it for only a short while too. 

IMHO, it will be easy to quit if you have been on it just a short amount of time. If you are trying to quit after many months or years I feel it might be hell? But I can only speak and write about my experience to be honest.  Reading about it and talking to people who have been on it for a year or two years or even three scared the sh!t out of me.

Thanks for reading.

TL/DR: suboxone as a long term plan (past one or two weeks) is a total joke IMHO. 


**update**

today is 72 days clean of opiates, benzos, alcohol. 10 days less if you count the subox. I feel like I always wanted to feel now w/o the drugs. I remember where I came from and still do not want to go back as of today.

Throw away here.

I am currently into the third week of my tapering off the cod, down from about 400MG day to now ~120MG. I'm feeling fine.

I have dropped the habit before properly, and started sipping again after about a half year. The main problems I encountered where sleeping troubles (Completely expected with the amount of promethazine I was consuming), the occasional sniffle and tear - but by far the worst was the mental side of it. Going from sipping a duece or four at night to nothing had me god damned bored.

I associate my down time with my sipping time, I think this is the main problem I am having.

I lead a rather active life, but this still seems to be a problem when I stop, how should I stave this off? I have found going through the green helps, but my lungs aren't happy with this.

Do you guys have any tips for staving off the mental side of this habit?

Just joined a new gym to get ready for an event, I wonder how this will help.

[EDIT] Does anyone know the microwave technique? If so, post it in the comments, I'm always up to try new methods.

[My Current Situation]
After I wised up and realized a skinny white kid who looks like he's 15 (20 in reality) was eventually gonna get picked up or beat up in Paterson, NJ, I stopped heading down there.

Now don't get me wrong, that dope is the best in the country over in Jersey. Highest purity, none of that tar shit, just dissolves like heaven.

Problem is, there's no dope where I live (about an hour from Jersey). The only consistent drug around were Roxicodone 30mg IRs, the blues. 

Now these go from $20-25 bucks, which isn't so bad for most people, but after shooting that Jersey dope, I needed to bang 6 or 7 of those roxis just to get good. I used to be able to do that with two or three bags of dope, which were $5 a bag.

I wasn't about to go from paying $20 a day for my habit to $200 a day.

I got on subs and chilled for a while, shooting three or four blues when I had the money, until the fateful day where my connect told me he had Opana 40mgs for $25 bucks, the same as his blues.

The Opana's are getting popular because you can snort them and they're cheap, but normally you CAN'T SHOOT them. These babies gel like a motherfucker when ANY amount of water touches them. I don't get off from snorting anymore, so I thought they would be useless until I remembered I had heard about crisping them. I had a bunch of the pills so without even looking it up, I just experimented until I found what I think is the best method.

[TUTORIAL]
Obviously remove the coating.

Crush the Opana or OP Oxycontin like you normally would, and put it in a spoon. Thin the powder so it will cook consistently, but try to keep it kinda consolidated so you don't have to keep moving the flame around.

Next take a candle and start cooking the powder. If you're short on time, a lighter is quicker, but obviously a pain in the butt. Use a knife to stir and kinda ""flip"" the powder periodically so it doesn't stick to the spoon.

It shouldn't smoke too much. A little smoke is okay, and there WILL be some steamy, smokey stuff that floats off. Don't worry about it. Keep doing this until it's pretty dark brown. Not burnt black, but not just crispy yellow. It should be evenly brown, sort of the color of brown heroin. I think it smells good while it's cooking =D. 

At this point, you can chop it up again and snort it (gross) to get the IR effects, or you can just chop it up a little bit in the spoon with a knife, and let the spoon cool down. Once it's cool, you can add water and shoot it like normal. The water will turn a yellowish color, a lot like dope.

[WARNING]: If ANY of the powder isn't crisped enough, that bit will gel, and while you won't lose your whole shot, it WILL be a bit of a pain in the ass to work around the gel, and you'll lose some of your drugs.

[TIPS]: Don't be afraid to over crisp it, and don't worry too much about small amounts of smoke. You will lose MUCH more of your drugs from undercrisping it than you will from overcrisping it.

You DO LOSE SOME OF YOUR DRUGS when you do this, but considering the fact that Opana is ABSURDLY POWERFUL, and the new OP Oxycontins are typically cheap because most consider them impossible to abuse, it pays off for me (and most other people I'd imagine) nicely.

Nod on my friends [Shoots 80mg of Opana to congratulate himself for informative post =D]

So I'm in general a curious person and I can't take it anymore hearing about the feeling of heroin without experiencing it. Obviously I don't want to get addicted, because 1) I don't want to ruin my life and 2) I don't wanna lose the feeling of the high and just use it to feel ""normal"".       

My questions are. 

i) Can you get **physically** addicted the first time you use it? (I'm not talking about psychological addiction.

ii) If I use it once a year (as I'm planning to) is there any chance I will develop physical (not psychological) addiction? 

iii) I don't want to get a dealer from here obviously, but **in general** where/how does someone find non-ghetto H in a big city? I know people that do oxy, but I don't know anyone that does H. Well, I know someone that might know but I don't wanna ask **him**. How do I get good quality without using people I know. This is also a safeguard for me not to get addicted, because it won't be that available. 

iv) Should I smoke, snort or inject? I know injecting is more dangerous, but I heard the feeling is better. Is the rush that good that snorting or smoking just doesn't measure up? 


Thanks a lot!

(Works great for withdrawals as well!!!1),"Downvote me if you will; but I would like to share with /r opiates what I have done with Imodium AD and narcotic painkillers. First of all, we should get started by knowing that Imodium AD's active ingredient is Loperamide, a dirivitive of the opiate know as Fentinyl. 
This morning, when I woke up; I was still feeling the lingering effects of opiate sleep. The previous nights mischief, I ingested one 30mg Roxicodone tablet, which lasted for hours on end with the inclusion of a 10mg Valium for anxiety/sleep. This morning around 9, I ingested 5 Imodium AD tablets and waited about 15 minutes before ingesting 15mg of Roxicodone. It took about 20 minutes for the Roxicodone to kick in, but right now, as I am typing this, it feels like I actually ingested about 45mg. So apparantly, Imodium acts as a potentiator for opiates considering the fact that Loperamide (Imodium) is a opiate in itself. 
Also, about 2 days ago, I ingested 12 Imodium (which may be a stupid idea, but I would do anything to get rid of the terrible withdrawal), and suprisingly, it took all the symptoms away and I was able to sleep through the entire night, no RLS/RAS, sweats, chills, NOTHING!! No, I wasnt constipated, yes I was able to poo. The only thing I have learned from my reading on Imodium, is that it cannot cross the Blood Brain Barrier, which is why the FDA listed it as a OTC poop aid.

I just recently got back out on the board after about a two year hiatus due to a really brutal ankle injury I sustained while skating a half pipe two years ago. After breaking two bones in my leg and tearing seven ligaments in my ankle I was pretty much a vegetable in terms of my social life. I was prescribed hella strong painkillers and had 4 different operations done in one month. After 4 months of intense physical therapy I gained the ability to walk again but lost the ability to control my addiction to the meds I was taking. Long story short, I was a mess. Fast forward two years and my leg healed over but I never really stopped taking opiates completely.. My friends and family caught on to my habits early but couldn't really convince me to stop taking the pills. Mad people out here pop pills like candy, so it wasn't hard to find them and It became a pretty serious issue quick. Now we fast forward a couple more months which brings us to this summer of 2011. After a long discussion with a good friend of mine, who was going through some very similar issues with drugs, we decided that the pills we're fueling most of the depression, woe, and negative energy we'd been living with lately, so we decided to make a pact, No more pills. No more pills from there on out! The pact coincided with the purchase of my two new boards (8' & 7'4'') and since then I've gotten into a pretty steady pattern of paddling out. I'm now finally getting the hang of catching break and it feels phenomenal! I don't intend on ever going back on that pact nor do I plan on ever giving up surfing. I'm planning a couple trips to local spots soon as well as road trips California and Florida. Surfing has changed my life for the best. No drug will give you the serenity of peacefully sitting, waiting for sets to come in, nor the intensity of catching a wave! The ocean is bliss for me and surfing is downright therapeutic. If there are any shredditors out there who share a similar situation, stick it out and never give up. Surfing is a way of life and should be embraced to the max! TL;DR : I stopped using drugs and started routinely paddling out. This decision drastically changed my life for the better and helped me become an all-around happier person! Waves are now my new drug of choice.

Due to my experience, I'd like to give some hints on how to make your WD's pass in the easiest way possible, BUT MAINLY, how to take advantage of some body/mind disenchantments. THIS IS MAINLY DIRECTED TO PEOPLE WHO WILL WITHDRAW DUE TO LACK OF MONEY OR BAD LUCK – KICKING THE HABIT IS A WHOLE OTHER STORY WHICH I WILL NOT GET INTO…

Keep reading if only you fill the criteria below:

1. Your habit is not monstrous, thus your WDs do not put u in 100% disability mode.
2. You will use some of the practical advice mentioned here, beforehand,  in order to ease the WD symptoms.

PART 1 – ACCEPTING THE CONSEQUENCES OF YOUR CHOICE
Try not to refer to yourself as “ill” or to name your habit a “disease”. By concentrating on this before starting to feel “the curse coming”, your mind will be less terrified by what’s happening to your body, and it will not add any additional psychosomatic symptoms due to guilt, stress, etc. 

OPIATE WDs ARE NOT DANGEROUS FOR YOUR BODY: THEY JUST STRESS IT A LOT. 

Benzo and Alchohol WDs cause MUCH worse symptoms, Delirium Tremens, Epileptic Episodes, Psychosis, even Death.

You must accept that the choice of using such a strong a chemical armor/crutch in your life, has consequences when your armor is missing in the battlefield called ‘life’.

Thus, do not steal; do not beg for money; do not borrow; Some people say “oh, it’s the illness doing these things/saying these things, not me”… Oh, honey, it’s you, and the way you chose to manage your self-medication.

Do not do things that will create guilt in the future. Just live 3 days of misery. That’s the consequences of using opiates girl. Embrace them. Don’t punish yourself, but try to experience them as a part of your general opiate use. Life has it’s mountains, but it has its scary places, too. If you don’t accept that, tolerance will skyrocket and non-existent God knows what you’ll do to get your next fix. But if you do accept that fact, maybe you can keep your habit stable for years (yeah, these people DO exist) and minimize the risks.

By not avoiding the aforementioned things (stealing, scamming, etc), you will be needing more of the opiate of your choice, not only to satisfy your desire for it, but to ‘one-up’ your ‘high-levelness’ to erase these feelings. This results in you being propelled into insane stages of tolerance. These stages of tolerance require more money, so this vicious cycle will continue.

Even if you have made a conscious choice to use opiates as self-medication, keep it low, and remember to not become the caricature you thought you’d never be. You cannot imagine how easy it is….

PART 2 – PHYSICAL TIPS TO EASE THE WDs SYMPTOMS
1. Kratom tea or Kava-Kava. Even with these, use a sitter.
2. Drink LOTS of fluids, even if this upsets your stomach. Try to consume them gradually, not at once.
3. Use Royal Honey. It is used in many detoxification institutes, and for some strange reason, it eases the WD symptoms. Maybe because it provides the body with the essential vitamins etc that it needs.
4. EAT. Royal Honey is not enough for your body. Do not over-do it, though. Listen to your body, and if you feel you’re gonna throw up, opt for juices or liquid foods.
5. EXERCISE. I know. I’ve been through this. Experiencing WDs, even in the lowest levels, makes you not wanting to quit your death-bed. Trust me, begin from Day 1 walking around your block / doing some gentle yoga, and it will take the edge off.
6. Take a bath at least twice a day. This is also an exercise, but keeping your body clean and away from the terrible smell of the withdrawing person’s sweat will play a small positive role. 
7. No other substances. Especially Marijuana, if used by bodies which suffer by WDs, it will make them even more paranoid, it will pronounce the ill feelings, etc. MJ is a psychedelic. Who needs this in a situation where everything is nightmarish speedy and even surreal. No alcohol – it’ll lower your inhibitions. Use Benzos (if needed) with a sitter, who will keep them in a secret place and feed u whenever you have planned before hand. These fuckers can also lower your inhibitions. Use Buprenorphine at your own responsibility. My opinion is that if your habit is not huge (10+ years, hardcore shooters, etc), try to avoid it.
 8. Watch movies. Especially the kind that will make you laugh, or make you emotional and cry – this connects with the next part. They will also keep your mind occupied. Spend hours listening to your favorite music – ESPECIALLY FROM YOUR TEEN-EARLY ADULTHOOD YEARS, trust me, it matters positively.


PART 3 -  THE MOST IMPORTANT
Okay, since this is NOT a “how to kick the habit” thread, but how to survive WDs with the least emotional trauma, let’s get to the chase.
If you have passed Day number 3-4, (whilst probably you’ll be feeling slightly better) you will start to feel some strange ‘emotions’ at your tummy and at your heart. These are forgotten feelings, or –according to others- normal feelings multiplied X 100 due to lack of the opiates. 

I was vacationing, and I choose to take a break. At day number 4, I couldn’t look at my friends and not start crying. Not because of pain/guilt/trauma. But because of such a high level of fondness felt, that was beyond ridiculously intense.

Let’s use these ‘enhanced’ feelings:

1. Watch movies that played an important role for your life, even from childhood: They will make you think a lot, sort things out, laugh, cry, etc.
2. Listen to music from your teen years for the same reasons.
3. When you are with a friend, and these intense feelings occur, be the bravest creature and EXPRESS THEM. Tell them you love them. Tell them you hated them all this time. This alone will play a HUGE part in getting your habit in a more controllable state.
4. Stay alone and do nothing. Take NOTES of what’s going through your mind (be it hellish or positive). Maybe you’ll find out WHY you needed the Opiate Armor in the first place, and if it really fits you.
5. Try to be creative. Even if you’ve never been involved with the Arts, promise yourself that you will complete just ONE work of art: You can freely choose amongst all that exists. Maybe that little poem you’ll write will make a positive impact for your Opiate Self when you’re back on drugs, or for the people surrounding you who seem to not understand your “self-destructive behavior”.

That’s it. This is NOT for people trying to kick the habit forever. It is for the unlucky ones, who, for practical reasons will have to spend 1-6 days without their opiate of choice. 

When we get into such a situation we have to make some positive things out of it!

I wrote this because I chose to accept the responsibilities of my very long term use, and my tolerance never skyrocketed. I never steal. I am healthy as fuck. 

Opiates destroy lives because of the societal framework they exist in. We all hear stories about people who lost friends / relatives due to opiate use, but do you guys wonder why we never hear stories about people who self-medicate successfully for more than 50 years? Because they are IN THE CLOSET.

Full legalization of all substances, with proper education for each and every one of them.

ivkur,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/ivkur/new_to_opiates_just_a_few_quick_questions/,12,https://redd.it/ivkur,throwaway5979243,"New to opiates, just a few quick questions.","Well hello r/opiates, fancy meeting you here.  I'm a long time weed and cigarette smoker, occasional drinker, occasional tripper on LSD and shrooms, although that's mostly in the past now if only due to lack of availability, and I've long sworn I'd never touch opiate drugs.  Now it's not that I didn't think I'd like them--no, I knew I'd like them, I just didn't think I'd be able to control myself.

Well, I had to go to the hospital for an emergency surgery a little while back and this all changed.  I refused pain medication for quite a while prior to my surgery, but the pain I was experiencing was literally unbearable so finally I said ""Alright, fine, give me the pain medication.""

They shot me up with 10mg morphine, and though I was still in pain, I was in heaven.

Over the next few days I got shot up with 3 something of fentanyl on one occasion, 1mg of hydromorphone on several others, and I made it out of the whole experience with a script for 30 5mg/325mg Oxy/APAP Percocets, with the directions ""take 1-2 every 4-6 hours as needed for pain.""

Well, I followed those instructions loosely for the first few days, trying to keep it down to twice a day only, to keep my tolerance down so I might continue enjoying the buzz without having to take more so as not to a) burn down the stash b) get addicted or c) wreck my liver with an acute APAP overdose.  Anyway, eventually the buzz stopped being what I wanted it to so I stopped popping the pills.  Said I'd take a break for a day, see how it was then.  One day turned to two, two days turned to three, and now nearly a week has passed (well, okay, I think it's actually only been four days) and I haven't had any, although I fully intend to soon, when the time is right.  Maybe tomorrow, maybe the next day--I'm gonna try not to take this stuff, or other opiates in general when I try them, because I think I do at this point intend to, to a) keep my tolerance down, keep the buzzes good and b) not get addicted.

Anyway, with that preface, my questions are:

-Should I just take 3 of the 5mg pills right off the bat?  That's 975mg of APAP which should be fine, but is there any chance that could be too much Oxycodone for me?  Or maybe too much to be fun?  I have been known to have drug related anxiety before.

-What's all this CWE stuff about--I mean, I know it means cold water extraction, but what is the point and is it something that could help me to get more bang for my buck here?

-Should I try snorting these bad boys or should I just eat them?  Right now I'm leaning toward eat them.

-Anything you guys recommend I try/do while doped up?  Any music, movies, anything like that?

-Any other tips you guys have?  I don't really have any IRL friends who do these kind of drugs, mostly I'm just friends with weed smokers and trippers and drinkers and mostly I am just a weed smoker and a tripper and a drinker, but recent developments have led me to my new stance which is ""fuck it, might as well get smacked out every now and again.""  Anything I should keep in mind?

Thanks in advanced guys.  Much love!",1311227800.0

I am an addict, but I am an addict who has succeeded in moderation. I only use on weekends and holidays. Half of it is because working on opiates seems like a waste to me; I'd rather be curled up doing something comfortable than in a stale office working my soul away. I have gone 3 years limiting myself to only weekend and holiday use: I am confident, despite the incessant warnings, that I can control my usage.

I do not wish to openly say my drug of choice but it lasts 12 hours per dose. I usually dose as soon as I get home on Friday at 5 pm and dose for a continuous high all weekend. I take my last dose on Sunday noon-ish. I do this fairly consistently every weekend: with breaks when I cannot use that weekend [usually about 2-3 weeks every 3 months due to travel for work], and binges when I get holidays. 

Anyway, with this schedule I still get slight withdrawals. They are bearable: I am able to perform my duties at work correctly. They are mostly minor muscle aches and anhedonia. Although I can live with them and have for 3 years, I am looking for what the ""golden spot"" is between using opiates as often as possible and not having to suffer withdrawal. I am thinking of switching to a one weekend once every 2 weeks schedule and see how that goes. The constant aches from withdrawal can be irritating from Monday to Friday afternoon each week. 

Any suggestions? 

ALSO: Immodium (Loperamide) is a WONDERFUL aid for withdrawals. I question however what effect it will have on my opioid tolerance, and if Loperamide would prolong my withdrawal.

I'm about to make another, very honest attempt to kick dope and oxy's. I've tried Suboxone, but it wasn't for me...

I was wondering if anyone knew some surefire herbal / natural remedies to help withdrawal symptoms.

I'm excited to start (perhaps tomorrow), and when I began to search the web, there were just SO many sites and once I began to sift through the advertisement sites, sites used primarily by people who were never taught the basic principals of grammar, sites with broken links to other sites, I decided to go to reddit before i got too frustrated.

At this point, it isn't an emotional or mental addiction. Everyday I say I'm going to quit. I would like to take better care of myself: I'm less depressed, about to start a different career... I've been more creatively driven and I feel like this is a good time to quit.

It's the pain of withdrawal the keeps me going back. I dont even get 'high' anymore- it's more like a maintenance thing, so that my veins don't feel like they're full of ice cubes and sewing needles.

Any advice would be amazing. thank you.

Do you guys feel powerless before opiates like I do?,"Currently 23, my opiate experience began at age 16 when a bad soccer injury left me with two herniated discs, l5-s1 and l4-l5, and a numb left foot. I was given perc 7.5s, and right away began stashing them so that I could multi dose after accumulating a few (my mom wAs holding my Meds at thAt time)....

Went to college, and really didn't pursue them much. Took tramadol when the pAin was unbearable, but nowhere near daily using. I had not yet been exposed to any opiate formulation without ApAp coupled in it, so I had not been ever able to consume larger doses.

Upon graduating college, I worked a month or so back home landscaping, during which my coworker and friend from throughout high school introduced me to the blue 30 mg roxi's. This was about a year and two months ago from now.

As if I had been wAiting for them my whole life, my use quickly escalated to at least one daily, more when partying or playing a show or something. Within 4 months of snorting my first blue, I realized that I could obtain opiates from a doctor, legitimately, for much cheaper, as I have plenty of progressively worsening MRIs and documented nerve damage down into my left leg.

Flash forward to now, I have been blowing through my script of 120 30's per month within the first week, every time for the past 7 months. As if I have no intelligence, I accelerate my usage up until nothing is left, aware that the stash is running out, but concerned only with the current experience of the high. Then, without fail, I smash into the wall that is cold turkey WD, suddenly with nothing after taking at least 12-14 everyday. The following three weeks consist of insomnia, anxiety, depression, guilt, anger at myself, disbelief that I seriously actually did it like that AGAIN; until, yes, refill day, where I find myself filled with energy and happy, seeming to forget completely what pain these have cost me.

Last month, I relocated for a new job. Still living close enough to the doc to make the trip every other month, which he accommodates by post dating the second month's worth. I ended up, obviously, ripping through them in a week after promising myself to abide by the rule of no more than one pill per dose but simply never getting around to it. As always, I rationalize it all in order to live with myself without going mad over my apparent powerlessness.

Anyway, the periods between my binges, colored by a lack of neurotransmitter activity, I suppose, are often filled with negativity focused upon myself. Why can't I get it together? Why cAnt I seem to take ANY control AT ALL? When did I become so weak?

Blah blah. I am terrified by the fact that I need to live this life until the finish line. In a little less than a month I have my next appt, and I'll be there, absolutely. Part of me hates that fact, but part of me completely loves it, and I've watched myself enough to know better than to think I might be able to turn down such an opportunity.

AnywAy, I guess I'm just looking for others with experience or some new advice that will change everything, lol. Because honestly I feel 100% out of control once I've got that stash. Nothing else matters, or ever could. And I plunge deeper and deeper into the abyss, seemingly in an attempt to forget my own existence. I am horrified by the thought of what future pain I will cause others, because no matter how much pain it has caused me, NEVER have I been able to hold on to any sense of conviction that I actuLly want to stop, for myself. 

For this reason, I don't think there is any help for me. Going to a rehab is pointless, as I don't want to stop. Everything really is pointless, because the only reason I'm bothering to think about it now is bc I don't have any of them to do. 

A part of me hates how much money I waste on it, how many things go undone each day, whether bc of lack of motivation or being too high for them. Quite honestly, I hate the person that I have become because of them. In my mind, conceptually, my life story has taken a drastic turn for the worse.

And yet, I don't wAnt to stop. All I want is that feeling again. Because when I'm there, all the bullshit just dissolves into nothing. All the pain and tension and anger and fear dissipates, and I am able to let go for once, completely. When I am on opiates, I quite literally could be cleaning a public bathroom; I will enjoy myself. Whatever situation I find myself in, my mind performs a constant scanning of the body, savoring every subtle aspect of the opiate blanket. I am hardly even aware of the outside world. My awareness is completely absorbed by the bliss of numbing out.

But the problem with opiates, they always wear off. And so I play the game. Scheming whatever way necessary to enable a swift transition from sober to opiated. Friends are concerned, I lie about having stopped. I only hurt myself, but I cannot cope without the escape. Despite seeing myself digging the hole deeper, I cannot find the motivation, the rationale, any overall basis for MY actually becoming committed to sobriety. What does a person like me do? Accept my fate as am addict? The same as my father has?

kz0rp,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/kz0rp/thoughts_from_a_junky/,8,https://redd.it/kz0rp,thoughtsfromajunk,Thoughts from a junky.,"Heroin is a hell of a drug.  It's interesting to me to see how others judge someone when they find out he is junky.  The media has effectively vilified heroin to the point that being classified as a junky is about the same as being diagnosed with a terminal illness.  Is a junky ill? yes. I suppose so.  But using heroin or, his choice to use heroin, is not an indication of him having a death wish or a complete disregard for the value his own life.  Quite to the contrary, I'd be willing to bet that most junkies love being alive.  After all you can not get high when you are dead. Rather, I'd say his choice to use, it is a weighted calculation, that, to the junky, at the moment of all consuming desire, seems a rational choice. After all what would make more sense than doing something that will not only remove considerable physical discomfort, but will also propel him into a state of absolute content. A state that allows him to forget about the person he just robbed or the loved one left waiting on him.  In that initial rush the feeling is so intense it is impossible for him not to sigh with sick indifference to everything around him.  A smile spreads across his face, smug because nothing in the world matters, absolutely nothing can slow him down. All that will of course dissolve and nature, very appropriately, taxes him with a sickness that is as unpleasant as the high was amazing. It is how the universe works.  Everything will eventually balance itself to obtain an equilibrium.  If his desire to use is greater than his desire to quit, there is an imbalance he will rectify.  Maybe for him, his desire to use is so strong that only complete and utter destruction can deliver enough weight on the side of getting clean to cause him to quit. Maybe, his desire to use will always be the dominant force, and he will always use. The problem with kicking dope is that the good that comes of it often takes too long to set in a be appreciated by him.  Before he can appreciated the beauty of sobriety the desire to use overwhelms him and he caves.  More imbalances are created that are most easily counterbalanced by dope.  It's a cycle that sucks.  A cycle I hate being stuck in.  ",1317614810.0

","Today is four days clean from a habbit of shooting anywhere from 3 to 10 balloons (bags for you east coasters) every day.  I haven't been going through any withdrawals because I have a scrip for subs and I actually haven't even been craving too bad.  Basically this attempt at sobriety comes after an incident of my sister noticing track marks, threatening to tell my parents, leading me to have to admit to them that I relapsed.  Right now I'm a full time college student and work part time about 25 hours a week. My grade average is a 4.0 and I actually just got a raise at work. Basically my life stats are up to par with any other 19 year old white male from a middle upper class family.  Most people would never guess that I'm a junky (although anyone whose not a part of this culture would be surprised at the different types of people that use dope).  I live at home and my parents pay for my schooling.  I still live in their house so I understand them not wanting me to use in their house and while I'm here I figure they have the right to set some rules for me (even though I'm an adult).  Anyways, after this relapse they've basically given me my last chance... either get clean or get completely cut off.  So here I am, four days in, going to NA meetings, trying to get a sponsor, making changes for the better, etc etc...  My question is, how many of you are in a similar position?  You are either highly functional or at least average and maintaining a dope habbit, however you have outside influences that are forcing sobriety upon you for seemingly no other reason than ""heroin is bad"".  My feelings about the sitaution I'm in are pretty Bi-polar.   They range from feeling angry at my family.  They don't understand what heroin is like, what it does to you.  Basically they equate heroin with death.  I know people can OD from heroin and that it is not healthy, but if used properly and a consistent dose is maintained there are really no long term side effects from habitual use.  I think most people don't really know that.  As long as I am fulfilling my responsibilities and being a productive member of society I don't see how they can tell me what I should or shouldn't put into my body... And then there's my other probably more accurate feelings about my situation: I am a drug addict and doing drugs is dragging me down.  Sure I can go to school and maintain good grades and a job while being strung out but those are really just justifications to use.  I get high because I'd rather spend my day numb to my emotions and in no way is that healthy.  Doing drugs is only going to limit my abilities.  At best I'll be able to maintain the bare minimum to appear successful on the outside all while only being satisfied on the inside as long as I have a b to shoot.  I can debate these feelings and thoughts back and forth but as strong as my feelings are about me needing to get sober I still feel like I want to use more than I want to get clean.  I really really want to want to get sober... not because I have to, but because it's what's good for me... It's a very hard feeling to achieve.  Anyways sorry that kind of turned into a rant.   So what about you guys? your feelings on sobriety? ",1317967615.0

Keep in mind this is a cycle that I have gone through three times, usually on for a few years and then quitting for a few when the pain goes down. 
So I decided that the time has come to quit taking the pills. I have a stockpile of muscle relaxers and xanax to assist with the withdrawal but I am looking for advice. The last two times kicking the pills was brutal and I am looking for any ideas to help reduce the myriad symptoms involved in the process. 
I am, luckily, blessed with a low level of psychological dependence, so once I decide to quit I am not worried about backsliding at all. I will have the bottle of remaining norco on the table next to my bed and I am not worried about any risk of taking them again. I only mention this because it might factor into your advice on what to do to quit.

I am from a large city center in the American South (think Atlanta, Houston, DFW) but am currently attending a very small and conservative religious college in a small town (compared to ""home"") about an hour from a fairly large (also, unfamiliar) metropolitan area.

I'm still in The South here at school so I know the meds are out there. I just don't know how to start that kind of relationship. (My previous encounters were with acquaintances from high school.)

Again, I'm unfamiliar with the rules here, as this is the first time I've even thought to see if reddit had any subreddits based on drugs other than r/trees. Any and all criticism or help will be appreciated.

You have never tried opiates. You're the average person, with the average level of natural happiness.

This is represented by zero (0).

When something slightly good happens (like having a nice sandwich), you get a few points (+5). 

When something really really good happens (like being high) you get lots of points (+xxx etc).

When something bad happens, you lose points depending on how severe e.g. stub your toe (-xx), WDs (-xxx etc).

What I want to know:

1) How long you have been using.

2) What you have been using mainly.

3) Your Score, be it +, - or 0 (only take into account things that are opiate related e.g. experiencing the highs,  WDs, losing a job or someone close, etc).


I'm a light user - codeine phosphate bi-weekly, a few times with OxyContin (5mg crushed oral), mainly to get over hangovers from stimulants.

-Take a spaghetti sauce jar or quart-sized mason jar and combine with a a few squirts of lemon juice and then fill the jar up 2/3 of the way with near-boiling water.  Let the jar sit for about an hour so it is thoroughly brewed, shaking every few minutes.

-Get one of those big yogurt containers (32 oz) and a square foot of fabric from a t-shirt.  Wrap the fabric around the top of the yogurt container and put a rubber band around the mouth of the container, holding the fabric in place.

-Pour the poppy sludge/tea through your t-shirt fabric, so the tea passes through the fabric, leaving the sludge behind.  Squeeze out the ""ball"" so you get all the juice.  Throw away the grinds.

-Drink the tea while holding your nose.  Chase with OJ or fruit juice.  I potentiate the poppy pods by drinking white grapefruit juice beforehand.",1319461752.0

You start cooking your tar and once you see it start to dissolve stop and mix it around with your plunger. Now, start cooking it again until you have it down to between .4-.6 of a ml.

I am sure everyone today has their own stories about their horrible visits to hospitals, and I am no different.  Back story is for several years now I have had problems with my lower back, and I go to pain management because of this.  The problem is with my disks, and I have had several Lumbar RadioFrequency procedures to burn off nerves in my spine.  So obviously I take pain medication so that I am able to get up and movie around, otherwise I would basically be stuck in bed all day.  

Back in June I had though I got food poisoning, I got home from work around 11pm, made myself something to eat, and about 30 minutes after eating, I starting vomiting.  Problem was, anything that I tried to eat or drink came right back up, including my pain meds.  This went on for about 12 hours before I decided to go to the hospital.  At this point  I was severely dehydrated from the vomiting, and since I had not been able to keep any of my pain meds down for the past 12 hours, was in quite a lot of pain.  I get there, they start giving my IV fluids and anti-nausea meds, and I explain to the nurse and doctor my situation with my back.  They could obviously see I was in pain, but they refused to give my anything.  They discharge me a few hours later, with instructions not to eat or drink anything for 24 hours to let my stomach settle, and when I asked what to do about my pain meds, they said I will have to deal with the pain, WTF!  I go home, and because of my back pain get little to no sleep.  The next night i try to have something light to eat, and right away start vomiting again.  Six hours later, I go back to the hospital.  This time I brought my refill scripts with me to prove I actually take my medication, and thankfully they give me something for my back.  I get discharged a few hours later, and deal with another day of not being able to take my meds.

About a month ago, while at work, I start vomiting again and again.  On my way home from work I have to stop 6 times to pull over and vomit.  I go to the same hospital as last time, and this time I bring my medication with me to again prove I actually take them.  When I get there, I tell the nurse about my meds, and show her my prescriptions, and she take a look at me (due to the vomiting I was obviously pale, and was sweating pretty bad), she then tell me that my vomiting, sweating, etc, is because I am going through withdrawals from my medication.  I explain that this can't be true, I had taken my meds around 4:30-5pm, and started vomiting around 8, but to no avail.  My requests for something to help with my back are completely ignored.  I am discharged and told that I should go to detox to get off the pain meds.  Now this happened on a Friday night, and the vomiting continued through the weekend.  I was unable to keep any of my pain meds down, I couldn't and didn't sleep at all until about 2pm on Sunday, and even then I only got about 2 hours, and another 4 hours that night.  So as you can guess I was in intense pain, and basically wanted to kill myself at this point.  Monday, I decide to again go back to the hospital.  Before I got there, I called up my pain management and explained what had been going on, and said that I was going back to the hospital again.  When I got there, I went over what happened on Friday night, and again explained the situation with my back and the pain meds.  They again refused to give me anything to help with my back, so I asked them to call my pain management office and speak to one of the doctors.  They ignored my request, and I had to ask another two times to finally get them to call.  After talking to my doctor, they FINALLY gave me something for my back.  I was in the hospital for another 6 hours or so, and after about 3 1/2 hours I could feel the medication wear off.  So as I am being moved to go get a scan of my stomach, I asked the nurse if they could give me another injection.  She said she would ask the doctor about it.  What followed next made me want to kick the fucking shit out of the doctor.  When I got back from the scan, I asked the nurse about the medication again, and she said she hadn't been able to reach the doctor to ask him, and she apparently couldn't find him for the next couple hours.  

I was discharged a few hours later, at this point the medication has worn off  a couple hours earlier, and I was again in agony.  When I was receiving my discharge instructions I again inquired about something for my back, so that when I get home I could try and get some sleep, since my back pain prevented me from getting much sleep.  She informed me that the doctor didn't want to prescribe me anything due to me being in a pain management program.   Basically, my requests and myself were completely ignored by the doctor, he didn't even see me before my discharge.  I was treated like someone who was trying to scam the hospital out of drugs, trying to get my next ""fix"".  Even with proof of my prescriptions, as well as talking to my pain management doctor, confirming my pain, the doctor still saw me as a drug seeker.  The first injection of pain meds was seeming only done because my pain management doctor told him to give it to me.  Again, I was forced to endure another day of total agony, until I was finally able to keep my meds down.

Doctors today when faced with a patient who is in pain, and requesting medication to help with it, seem to automatically think that person is trying to score some drugs.  I know that there are some doctors that actually take the time to evaluate the patient, and will help someone who needs it.  I just hate the fact that even with me proving that I have prescriptions for the medication, they still refused medication.  And even after talking with my pain management doctor, they reluctantly gave me one dose, and then completely ignored every other request I made.  They could see my pain, didn't care, and left me in horrible pain.  It is clear to me that most doctors today don't seem to care much about the patient, they just want to clear their patients and get paid.

I've kept my dosages relatively low, with the most I've ever done was 20 mg of dilaudid in an evening and that was only once. I normally do 8mg dilaudid throughout the day, with most days being closer to 6mg. I also have 5mg oxymorphone every now and then. 

So my plan was to take a five day weekend starting on the Wednesday before thanksgiving.  I was going to stop completely on the Sunday before (after weening down as much as possible with whatever I can) and push my way through work on Monday and Tuesday. I'd then use the 5 day weekend to work through the lack of motivation that is really the worst withdrawal symptom I experience. 

I have access to maybe 4 or 5 strips of suboxone (not sure of what mg, if that's applicable).  Would it be worth the trouble to get those and ween myself down starting that Monday?  Maybe go from 1 for two days, .5 for two days and then .5 every other day? 

I'm not too worried about withdrawal, as I've quit for 4-5 days before and just didn't want to do anything but sleep.  Has anyone had experience on quitting such a low dose habit, or would you consider it a low dose habit? 

My biggest fear is the anhendonia that I'm sure to experience afterwards.  I have a very demanding job in which I need to be outgoing everyday, all day.  If anyone has any tips on bringing back the joy of life after opiates, that'd be greatly appreciated.

- They are Mylan 50mcg patches
- I've used anywhere from 1/10 th of a patch to 1/2 of a patch almost everyday for about 6 weeks.
- I've experienced pretty terrible withdrawal from poppy tea before, but never anything stronger.

For those experienced, what am I in for? What legal remedies can I get to mask the symptoms? Skin-crawling restlessness was by far my worst symptom last time.

I've been trying to figure out did this really work and if so was it efficient or just a waste? My thinking is that as long as the temperature of the smoke when it reaches the filter is higher than the vaporization temperature of the opiate, it should work. The opiate isn't burned so it shouldn't be especially wasteful. I just can't find any particular data on the temp of cigarette smoke at the filter to validate whether I'm on the right track.

I came across this article talking about hard to cure depression.  For those who had been through the gamut of drugs which work on the traditional neurotransmitters (Serotonin, Dopamine, etc etc) with no luck, the theory is you may have a lack of Endorphins. What is the one solid cure to this? Opiates-which are basically man-made (and usually plant-derived) endorphins. Apparently some very cool doctors who I wish were in my area are prescribing low-dose opiates (say, 5mg oxy 3x a day) for depression. More common are shrinks using Bupe as a last resort A-D.

Will this ever catch on?

My tolerance isn't very high, and virtually all of my use of opiates has been codeine/dihydrocodeine/kratom. It's been a long time since i've used anything stronger (hydrocodone or oxycodone).

One thing that I notice is that I often hear some sort of auditory hallucination when I'm nodding on (dihydro)codeine. I can't really describe it right now but it's something along the lines of me hearing an incoherent voice of sorts. It's a bunch of words and syllables with seemingly no pattern to them.

Last night I took a nap and remember that as I was drifting in and out of sleep, I was mumbling some of the words that were flowing through my head. Once again i don't remember exactly what i was saying, but it was usually phrases of a couple or a few words at a time.

My first link shows a screencap of my last few days' methadone consumption. I waited 28 hours. I woke up after knocking myself out with some diazepam and sleeping really well. (Longest sleep I've had in a month, huzzah!)

**I felt a bit incapable but I was NOT in withdrawal when I took the subutex** (circa 2mg sublingual with the residue from cutting up an 8mg subsequently snorted).

So, I'm a chipper, just went on a bit of a bender, and about to go through (according to all you helpful opies) a minor hangover/wd.

When does PAWS become something that is unavoidable after the withdrawal? Is it after using straight for X number of days, chipping for X number of years, or does it vary so tremendously between different people that there is no way to get a clear answer?

I have chipped for about 6 months now, this past bender is by far the longest I've gone on. Usually I'll get a bundle on a friday night and be finished with them by sunday morning, one weekend a month. 

Although I am cognizant of the fact that I function better on opiates, I wouldn't say I LONG for them when I'm not using. Nor have I had a ""drug dream"" yet.  Will this luxury soon vanish, leaving me salivating over my next weekend binge? Encroach on my thought process so much that I'll inevitably wind up a daily user?

Was it fentanyl..or just THAT pure?,"A little background on me, to show what my tolerance to opiates is like.. I started experimenting with opiates four years ago, and moderate-heavy use began around three years ago. I went from 20mg (two 10mg pills) of hydrocodone three times a week to 50mg of hydrocodone every other day very quickly. My hydro supply ran out, so I went to 15mg instant releasse oxycodone. I started off poppin' 15-45mg every couple days, then I starting railing that same dosage at the same time intervals. Eventually I started railing 80mg per dose, then 120mg, 160mg, 180mg, 225mg, and eventually wound up at 250mg around the climax of my OC abuse. I was bumpin' a maximum of two 250mg doses per day. I kind of got bored of OC, as it just did not get me high anymore. I found a heroin connect and was using 1-2 ""8 Ball"" brand stamps (these stamps were quite literally the size of a stamp, as I know I've seen larger ""stamp bags"") which was always a brownish powder of moderate potency. Eventually it took 3-4 of these to get me high, and the high always lasted a maximum of 45 minutes. I never IVed, only sniffed. One day (and this was my last heroin experience), I copped three stamps of some new stuff, labeled ""Red Lobster""; the powder inside of these stamps was pure white, like paper. I emptied out two stamps, and got a minuscule amount of powder on a finger, and of course I didn't want to waste it so I sharply inhaled it after putting my finger in my nostril. That small bit got me FUCKED, but I decided to do the other two stamps. It hit me within five seconds, and I felt the most powerful rush I had ever felt with any opiate, and it was by FAR my favorite high out of any substance I had ever ingested, ever. And I've done nearly everything under the sun, save for crack and meth. It lasted a half hour, but in that half hour it was complete and utter bliss, apathy, and I felt like I was flying. It was awesome, I just blasted Tool and bobbed my head for what seemed like hours. It should also be noted that the crash was worse then anything I ever experienced, I absolutely wanted to kill myself, and then I got so, so sick. I threw up for three days straight. I'm happy that I didn't do the third stamp, I don't know why I didn't, maybe some kind of fucked up premonition. I probably would've died. This experience is completely unlike any other opiate experience I ever had, although it was definitely an opiate, and slightly similar to heroin, but not much like morphine. Is it possible it was fentanyl, or heroin with a high fentanyl-to-heroin ratio? **I apologize for the long post but it's been really plaguing me lately, and I'd love some input.** At this point, I'm seventy-six says clean and sober, as I realized opiate addiction was ruining my life..that and the arrest for possession back in September, and upcoming probation and random drug tests, haha..",1323238557.0

My doctor is a GP with a license to prescribe Suboxone and Subutex. I previously had a slight Opana addiction (about mg/day) and he's been a great doctor. I, however instinctually abuse my Subs as soon as I get them (16mg/week) and he does not know that. I save 1mg for the day before his drug testing so everything apparently shows up normal to Ameritox. I can't get any euphoria or a nod from all that bup even when only doing it once a week. Is it not being properly absorbed or is the Nalaxone counteracting the high or am I missing something?

Also, I have Borderline Personality Disorder which gives me the skills of infinite pathological lies that he can't see through. Is there any way he would prescribe Opana or Oxycodone instead of Suboxone? I've talked over 40 scripts out of him since September for anything from benzos to z drugs to anti psychotics for sleep (Seroquel amongst others).

I've heard magical sounding stories from people with large scripts for long periods of time simply because the doctor ""trust them  with it"" and this doctor trusts me like no one else. Would he be too worried about losing his medical license to do this? And would medical insurance question paying for it?

tl;dr: Suboxone not working at any dose, could I convince my doctor to prescribe any full-agonist opiates like Opana/Oxy - I'm a pathological liar and already self prescribe anything I want for months without question or would he shoot me down because me might lose his DEA license? ",1323227972.0

With a mere 6 bags left, should I bother trying to titrate? I've been doing 2-3 bags at a time, either sniffing or plugging.

So in my search for non-insanely priced pods, I found a British company who sells all kinds of non pod related stuff: on their website, they have everything from water sports gear, jewelry, to toys for kids. 

Then they have a gardening section-with supposedly 100% organic, dried, Somneferum pods. Their price for medium/large pods is 40 quid (around $70), and they're having a sale on jumbo for 42.75 quid. This is with shipping INCLUDED. I emailed the company and asked a) how long shipping takes and b) if they are ever seized by customs, and within an hour they answered back 7-10 days, and no. 
Before I commit $80, I'd like some more reassurance it isn't a scam. The website doesn't show up at all on safeorscam.com

If any British user could PM me, I could tell you the name of the website to see if anyone has done business with them and if they are in fact, legit.

Thanks

Edit: I am in America, hence my concern about customs.

Edit 2: I placed an order, we'll see how it pans out. Came out to only $66 for a pound of gargantuan pods with shipping included. Compare that to the prices found if you google poppy pods-it's literally a savings of 75% or more!

Alright guys, my girl got a UTI and is really sick... she's had fever, and intense pain down low for the past few days. she's on medicine for it and also got prescribed 15 Vicodin 5/500. She took 2 and it helped some but she was still in pain.. so I looked for something stronger. I knew where to get subutex, and I couldn't really find anything else ('sides blak tar, and I figured it wouldn't do her immune system any favors). so I got 2 of the 8mg generics. I took bout 4 mg, and after I was feeling good, she decided to try just a tiny bit... 

Big mistake. she felt good at first but then she got really sick, even sicker than before.. In addition to already suffering from her infection her world is spinning and she's throwing up and dry heaving. I feel terrible, I wish I had realized that in suboxone, the naloxone isn't the real reason for the opiod antagonist--it's the buprenorphine, it's both a partial agonist and antagonist. I guess it blocked the 10 mg of hydromorphone in her system (she has no tolerance) and sent her into immediate withdrawls... fuck.

Is there anything she can do to feel better? She has a script for the vic/5's but I guess they won't do anything until the bupe wears off. How long should she wait before taking them again? Should she try more bupe before then? I'm guessing she only did around .4mg, if that.

I guess it's probably best that she not put anything else into her body... right? is there anything at all I could get to put her at ease without making her feel worse or interacting with what's in her system? Shit, she is dry heaving again now...

I was hesitant to believe in these things, I wouldn't believe it until I had felt it.  I've used Kratom in the past when I wanted a subtle buzz without having to resort to pills/smack, but it is just almost TOO subtle.
With pods, although subtle, there are definitely the tell tale signs of full agonists-warmth, mild euphoria, vivid dreams, etc. 

I found a great deal, paid $60 for a pound including shipping. I used probably less as a percentage for my dose than I would for an average Kratom dose, and noticed SO much more effect. 

I'm going to do my best to keep this to a weekend treat, as I always end up with GI issues when I overdo opiates.  However, seeing as how it cuts the risk factors so much (no sketchy rides to the ghetto, no wondering if that guy behind your dealer is a DT, etc) will make this a struggle for sure.

Basically, I came into a bit of money and went on a binge. I averaged about a bundle a day.  I was incredibly short sighted in setting up any sort of taper. I'm down to my last bun, and have absolutely no money left for more. I've been sniffing them, no needle usage at all. I will NOT resort to theft/etc to maintain my habit;  nothing against those who do, but I'm just way too soft for that noise.

I found a sub-doctor that takes my insurance and have an appointment in 8 days. I really want to make this as comfortable as possible-I recently lost a family member, and already have some underlying blues kicking around.

  As luck would have it, a friend of mine has some pods he recently ordered, about half a pound worth, already ground. I drank some from the same vendor with him  months ago and definitely felt a nice buzz off 3 medium sized pods-but that was before this month long bender.  Being the GGG that he is, he offered to give em to me free of charge.  He only uses on weekends and says he doesn't go through physical wd's if he goes without, so it's no skin off his back.

Would pods do a halfway decent job of holding off w'd until I can jump on subs? I plan on doing a fast taper of subs-start at about 1mg twice a day for 2 days, then .5mg 2x a day for 2 days, then .125 for 2 days, then drop.  I've done the sub rapid taper once before to come off a 40mg a day oxy usage for a month due to a car accident where I broke a bunch of bones and pinched a nerve, and it worked out perfectly.

If this could work, how should I dole out my doses? What would a fairly strong starting dose be, and how fast should I taper my doses down.

TL; DR: can I use half a pound of pods to hold off wd's from a month long bun a day sniffing bender until my sub appt. in 8 days.  If so, how. 

Thanks so much in advance fer any advice.

First off taking benzo's is out of the question since I need to pass a drug test and they stay in your system for way to long. Smoking weed is out for this same reason.

I took my last dose of H this morning around 12pm eastern and have cleared my schedule for this whole weekend which I assume will be spent laying in bed watching netflix.

I am expecting the worst of the withdrawals to last around 5 days and I intend on getting a few 8mg Subutex to help with the worst of it, my question regarding this is whether taking a few subutex during the worst of the withdrawals only make them last that much longer? or does that only occur when the subs are taken on a maintenance regime? I only intend on getting 2 or 3 8mg subs, but would rather not even bother with them if taking them is going to make the withdrawals last more than 5 days. I also have a shit load of Kratom at my disposal, would taking that also extend the withdrawals?

nonoi,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/nonoi/did_i_have_a_small_overdose/,7,https://redd.it/nonoi,anandamide,did I have a small overdose?,"so last night I did opana for the first time.  I'm used to taking oxycodone and have taken 70+ mg at a time a few times b4 and never felt anything more than slightly nauseous. I should mention that I only ever just eat the oxy, I don't snort it.

so anyway it was a 20mg opana (yes I removed the coating) and I was being very careful, only doing small bumps in intervals.

I'd say i did the first bump at about 1:45ish AM and then waited 20 min to a half hour and did another small bump.  at this point I wasn't feeling much so I grabbed a beer (this beer was 7.5 alc by vol).

so around 2:30ish AM I start feeling the effects and I am feeling pretty good.  I do another small bump.  and at some point later I had another beer  (I only had 2 beers all night total but would like to point out that I only drink very rarely and only drank this night because we had some special holiday beer in the house that I enjoy very much)

so at about 6AM I had consumed 3/4 of the pill and was feeling great but also tired.  I packed away the last 1/4 of powder to save for tomorrow. and went to sleep feeling like a million bucks.

at about 9 or 10 AM I woke up with one of the most excruciating migraines of my life (I have been getting migraines since I was little but they only happen maybe 3 or 4 times a year now)

I also felt very dehydrated and quite nauseous so I went to the kitchen and slammed 2 big cups of cold water.  I promptly went to the toilet and threw this up.  I threw up for about a half hour straight (most just water, stomach acid and the grapefruit I ate the night before)

every time I tried to stand up I got weak and felt like I needed to vomit again and my head would pound, once I crouched back down to the toilet I felt more ok but still shitty.  once I finally mustered up the strength I cleaned my face off and went back to my bed.

I don't know why but I had my puke towel wrapped around my head like from under my chin over the top. I don't know why I did this it just made me feel better.

so like an hour or two passes and I am feeling a little better but still very dehydrated.  I take literally the smallest sip of water possible and immediately after swallowing I projectile vomit into the bucket that I had placed by my bed.  this was very violent vomiting.  I filled the 2 and a 1/2 foot tall bucket about a 1/4 full of liquid. 

I tried to go back to sleep and didn't eat or drink a thing until about an hour ago.  (I should mention I finished off the last 1/4 of opana at about 6PM because I thought it would help with my migraine headache.  it did thankfully but the headache is still there, just more manageable.)

I ate a full meal and drank a can of pepsi (caffeine also works wonders for headaches)

but seriously what the hell happened to me?  did I overdose?  or could it have been food poisoning (I ate homemade tacos the night before but no one else who ate them has gotten sick) I feel better not but not back to baseline, I'd say more like 65% or 70% back.

Recently I met someone with $40 40mg Opana ERs. I had heard that it was 3-4x stronger than OC, so I cut it into quarters and did my best to remove the coating. Divided it into several tiny rails and snorted that (10mg total)... hoooly shit! 

I was in the best mood ever. I cleaned the house, I responded to old email, I even responded in that stupid Words With Friends game with my ex (why am I even playing with my ex?). Blitzed.

Then I went out with the roommates to see The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo... and it all went south :(. I was starting to feel a little dizzy on the drive over there, and puked 5min after we got out of the car. Np right? I felt better, but half an hour later again I had to run out of the theatre and puke into a bin. It happened again 20min later and I was like yep I need to go home. I wasn't feeling pukey anymore, just sleepy, so I drove home and embedded myself into the couch. 

Two hours later my roommates got back and found me underneath some blankets on the floor, passed out while The King of Queens was on. They were worried but apparently I was asleep with a big ol' smile on my face so they just laughed and helped me to bed.

A few years ago I was on a good run [or bad depending on how you look at it]. I hadn't spent more than a day or two sober for about a year. Unfortunately during this time I did a few illegal things in order to make money.

As a result of those things, I went to jail for a month. You would think I would have withdrawn right? Well, yes, a little. But it wasn't nearly as bad as it should have been. No physical sickness really, just a little anxiety, a bunch of restlessness, and lack of appetite for about a week. Mentally I knew there was nothing I could do, so there was no sense in freaking out about it. What this taught me is that a portion of your withdrawal symptoms are mental. A portion of withdrawal is your body and mind trying to convince you that you need to continue. You can tell it otherwise. If there's nothing that can be done, then there's nothing that can be done. If you find yourself in a place like this keep my story in mind.

* **400 Loperamide 2mg** - A potent opiate agonist that doesn't cross into the brain. Great for relief of anything opiate related belong the new. Especially in the gut and back
* **L-Tyrosine** - Precursor to neurotransmitters (Such as Dopamine and Norepinephrine
* **Vitamin B12 + B6** - Helps with energy and helpful in *any* cell metabolization
* **15 Ambien 10mg** - *Z-Drug* that promotes sleepfullness through the same channels as Benzodiazipines
* **6 Seroquel 50mg** - Antipsyhcotic with great sedative properties, my backup sleeping pill
* **27 Trazodone 50mg** - My backup, backup sleeping pill. Has negligible antidepressant effects
* *Marijuana* - Just makes life not suck so much. Removes my cold sweats/hot shivers

And of course I have Advil and other OTC NSAID's for pain.

So anything else I should get? Id like to try some L-DOPA and other neurotransmitter precursors if anyone has had any benefits from them.

I understand that Chlorpheniramine is what gets kids into trouble who are popping CCCs. I've never robotripped, have no interest, so don't really know the true danger/likelihood of  Chlorpheniramine OD.

These pills are time release hydro/ Chlorpheniramine, 10mg and 8mg respectively. I've taken 6 so far over 6 hours, and feel fine. That puts me at 48mg of  Chlorpheniramine. What are the signs of too much? 
How dangerous is this? Also, since it is a time release, how long until the  Chlorpheniramine clears out of my system?
