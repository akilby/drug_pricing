I'll be going to Amsterdam in about 2 weeks or so, if I were to dose up on h for 1-2 days would that cause me to go back into WDs?  I don't have any more subs so the potential WDs would be full blown.

It'll be roughly 3 weeks total from last h dose, 2.6 since last sub dose.  What are talks experience with doing something like this?  I know we all have different habits (regarding amount and time), I just personal experiences so I can gauge whether or not doing some for 1-2 days would cause any issue",1400245301.0

I find myself coming up with all sorts of stupid shit. For example, I once read that it was possible to recycle your opiates by extracting and filtering your urine for the useful morphine metabolites. Then I combined that with the idea that what you eat/drink flavors your semen in most cases. I then combined these two unrelated facts and thought about how awesome it would be if I consumed so much of an opiate that any semen I produced would be loaded with opiates, literally giving me that dope dick. Shit, I'd get people high just from cumming. Fuck it, I'm not even sure I'd share, I'd probably just become a pro at autofellatio and become really gay for myself (or is that masturbation still technically?).

For about a year my uncle has been taking 20mg controlled release Oxycontin morning and night for pain (cancer).

He's a pretty straight-laced guy, but he just found out a few weeks ago that his cancer is unfortunately terminal and he's determined to 'get high' at least once. It's on his bucket-list, I guess.

After searching online for him, I found that he should crush the tablets (we live in Europe so still have the 'old formula') and take them like that to make them instant release - but what sort of dosage should he take? 

He wants to be safe (he's got a big bucket-list!) but he tried 20mg last night and said he didn't really feel much.

This post is going to contain discussion and posts about suicide so I just wanted to warn everyone ahead of time of any possible triggers that have to do with **SELF HARM**, **SELF MUTILATION**, or **SUICIDE**. On that note, let's begin.

I've been using a variety of opiates now for the past 14 of 24 months. Currently, I'm just snorting dope, but oxy was my muse initially. At my greatest tolerance, I was doing anywhere from 10-30 30mg oxys per day. It began to take too much of a toll on my finances as well as my relationships with friends and family, so I stopped for the better part of 10 months. 

At the end of that 10 months, I smoked a bit of black here and there, but that was only for 5 weeks, and it was essentially free, and not something I did everyday. When I moved to where I live now, I was clean at the beginning but then started to look for dope. Within about 3 minutes of posting on a large opiate related sub-sect of a larger news aggregate website, I had a connect. He's been my D-Boy ever since. 

Over the past 2-2.5 months I've spent about $10,000, and made some of that money back. At the height of my use, I was snorting about 20-25 bags a day, each bag containing roughly a tenth of gram. My question, and the reason for me starting this topic is, with that type of tolerance, is it still possible for someone to OD? Say I had limitless money and dope that was pure. I don't shoot, only snort, and to be honest, even after 15 bags in one go, I barely get *that* high anymore. After a long day of doing a ton of bags I might nod at night, but it could be tied to just being tired. 

I guess I want to know, does Heroin, in snorted form, have a ceiling, or does it continue to stack up and make you higher and higher until (x_X).

...This really got me thinking. ..I spend so Fucking much on drugs that people can't even believe it. Sadly it was/is true. Thousands a month. I could own so many nice things. 

So this actually caused me to evaluate my life and priorities.  I can't remember the names of people who gave me shit n called me a liar but THANK YOU!! I've been taking methadone now for 3 weeks and aside from one blue (which wasn't worth it anyway) that's all I've been using. First 4 days I took up to 40 mg and still felt kinda off (had been using heroin and oxy) since then I've been taking 20 mg a day. After a week methadone really has been working well. The last 2 weeks have been awesome.  I wake up feeling pretty good and I don't spend all day hustling. Even though I'm still on a powerful opiate I feel way more normal. I know I'm not clean. .but I'm so fucked in the head that I may always need something. .time will tell if I can be totally clean.  I'm honestly ok with being on methadone as long as needed even if it's forever.  I still think about dope every day..I wanna nod so bad...I'm taking  enough methadone to stay well and cure most urges but not enough to really feel high.

Anyway I loaned my buddy 30 bucks today so he could get his kids food since he spent his money on dope...He smoked in front of me and offered me some...I really wanted to smoke but I didnt...I Fucking didnt! I'm proud of that. I'm still hooking people up with oxy and not taking it....I have so much extra dough even though it's just been 3 weeks. I'm planning on turning my connects over to trusted peeps.

25rm31,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/25rm31/a_fucked_up_situation/,19,https://redd.it/25rm31,fiery_fiend,a fucked up situation.,"So recently I found out my friend (let's call her S) has stage 2 lung cancer (not the kind you get from smoking but a different kind). She's really young to get that particular kind of cancer, in her mid 20's, and they found a tumor is taking up 60 percent of her left lung. They immediately started her in chemo and all the other treatment she is going to need. She is crying all the time from how much pain she's in. Literally all the time. She can't eat, she can't sleep, she can't do anything but lay curled up in a ball from the horrible pain she is experiencing. They are telling her to treat the pain with ADVIL.

And they won't give her pain medication. 

Now I can understand why doctors are hesitant or just flat out refuse me medication, since I have my medical record flagged. That is my fault. But she doesn't use drugs. She never has. But the fucking medical system in the states has gotten so FUCKED that they won't give a 25 year old girl with cancer any kind of medication to make her more comfortable while she has literal poison pumped through her body.

It is so heartbreaking to watch her cry all day. She can't move. She doesn't smile anymore. If someone with cancer can't get pain medication, who the fuck can? She's seen multiple doctors and the most she got was a week's supply of 5mg vicodin. Now, she's asking me for heroin, and I just can't. I hate seeing her in pain, but I just can't let her do that to herself.

I'm sorry for the rant, y'all, but this is eating at me and I don't know what to do. Does anyone have any kind of info on a program or different doctor I can get her in to see? I want to help her so bad, and I really don't want her to start using just because she can't get the relief she desperately needs. ",1400296828.0

I continued doing this once in the am and again before bed. No w/d symptoms!!! At night I took  Advil pm and took a hot bath and slept like a baby. Headache and restlessness were my worst symptoms, non existent on lope except for a minor headache from time to time that didn't last long. The only downside is the lope made me pretty lethargic, and I couldn't poop for like 3 days but laxatives took care of that. Anyway I thought I would share and plz ask any questions you might have.

So hello everybody! I'm Ciro, I'm italian, but moved to US when I was 16 and live here permanently now. In Italy we don't have drugs like meth, or there wasn't meth there when I was living there I think there is now though.

When I first moved here that was my drug I liked best. The US always seemed to me a wonderful place like you're in a movie all the time and meth only added to my positive perception, until I made a new best friend in my city. We hung out and drank beers but he didn't like meth and said I shouldn't do it either because of mental health risks, so one day he came over and gifted to me a 15 milligram oxycodone instant release.

Then he crushed it for me and I snorted it and the US, in the moment when it began to work, became heaven. It was love at first high for me. I still had half a bag of meth at that time but after the oxycodone it took me 2 weeks to even finish it. I was too occupied in getting more oxycodone.

Then he offered me heroin, which we did have in Italy but I never try it until I did it with him. I was floored-it was just like oxycodone but almost 10 times cheaper [1 gram of heroin is $60 and 1 gram of oxycodone would cost nearly $500] so I switched to that instead. 

I found this site a year ago and started lurking full time and now I want to join the discussion. I IV heroin now, and I realize my situation is not typical, but I have found it is not taxing to me or my family for me to be an addict of heroin. Actually my home situation is much better now that I am happy all the time and I have money of my own from inheritance so I don't need to steal or anything though I refuse to judge anyone who must do those things because I do not think I am any better than anyone and can understand the motive and thinking behind such actions having felt withdrawal now.

So I hope to make some friends here if you'll have me! I like reading posts here from the regulars like Tracey and heroinking and kitsune-san and suburbiaresident who are all good people. I just wanted to put my story out there and talk to people now! 

With that, I want to ask: how did you become an addict? What do you do day to day to get your drugs? And does it put a strain on your home and family life? Let me know!

After we spent all that time trying to get it, I had other commitments to take care of and my friend invited me in to do it...even though there were a bunch of people there and there was almost zero chance of us getting away with lying about it.

So that said, I said I would come by before work the next day and we could do it then. Less people, no drama, whatever. 

Friend drops off the face of the earth. Doesn't answer texts, completely no-shows in as far as I never went over. Fast forward a week and this person still isn't speaking to me. Finally replies to a text I send from my burner number (Google voice, I have it for a different reason but anyway) and is really short-tempered and rude.

By now, almost a week later, I'm 10000 percent sure the drugs are long gone. This person did this once before months back. And all things considered, this person already owes me for a time and a half. 

Lesson learned: don't leave your drugs with someone who'll do them, and don't let them ""owe"" you because they'll just drop off the map instead. I'm obviously amateur at this. 

(That said, I also really really think they have a problem and mutual friends have said that if something doesn't change it's looking like a probable OD. How have y'all dealt with it if you knew someone like that, do you just cut ties and give up on them, or what? Right now I'm too upset about getting my feelings hurt and being basically used, but deep down I also do care and hate to see other people have issues that serious. Advice?)

It's going to be 100 years old next year. It's time to get rid of it. The ""war on drugs"" is clearly a spectacular failure, so maybe the road to change could start with striking this idiotic piece of legislature before it causes another hundred years of misery.

Time was seemingly standing still the first week (probably because I didn't sleep much) but now it's already starting to fly by. I'm feeling pretty good at this point. I have energy again and want to do positive things for once. 

And now, the cravings. I didn't have any that first week, which made it easy to believe I would want to stay clean forever. But as everyone says, it takes some time for the mental aspects to really hit you. Although I have been clean from opiates, I have been smoking weed, I have taken vyvanse a couple times (really helped with depression and motivation), and I have used xanax to sleep a few times. I don't plan on continuing the vyvanse or xanax, but I am (in my opinion) not abusing these just to get high. I have had to remain functional enough to work through all this so these things have helped tremendously so far. 

The most important thing I think I have accomplished is this: I do not wake up wanting to get high now. I wake up and enjoy the mornings. I get shit done. And I use weed to relax and reward myself after work. I have been thinking deeply about the behaviors associated with addiction, and am avoiding addictive thinking at all costs. So far I think it has worked pretty well. But, as everyone says, this is just the beginning. Taking it one day at a time. Stay safe everyone.",1400352801.0

Anyway... I thought you all may be able to help me out with a side effect issue. 

I just had major leg surgery and along with this kind of procedure, comes a long list of powerful (to me) narcotic pain relievers. Now, I've never had this issue in the past (and I've lost count how many Ortho surgeries I've has), but this is my fucking SIXTH tib/fib/ankle procedure.  (When I get hurt, I go all out.)

Anyway, the docs always warned me about the constipation before, but it's never been an issue. However this time, I haven't had a poo in four days, as I'm a usually once a day poo baby kind of girl.

On my discharge notes, they list all kinds of meds you can use to stimulate your bowels, which is nice and all, but I'm completely reliant on my crutches and the cherry on top is that I have Irritable Bowel Syndrome which has me looking for a toilet wherever I go.   Shittng your pants in college and I'm public is something I will never forget. 

So do any of you have any recommends to ease back into my routine and not become a one woman poop baby spouting machine. Myself, our septic tank, and my bowels would forever in your debt. 

tl;dr - any nicer way to ease out of post surgery narcotic constipation!",1400352434.0

25xlne,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/25xlne/ughhh_time_to_find_a_new_job/,23,https://redd.it/25xlne,h3xpl01t,Ughhh time to find a new job,"So I've had the same job for about a year or so now. Its pretty good, work is easy as shit and I'm making $10/hour under the table. The owner is an acquaintance's wife, really friendly person. I come in high all the time and they still tell me all the time I'm one of their best workers (hey, who cares if you take 2 bathroom breaks a day as long as you're not nodding into the sink, right?)

My issue with said job is that my employer is broke. She depends on all of us just to stay afloat, but can't pay us in a timely or regular fashion. I have to keep track of all the back money I'm owed, which can extend back weeks. Initially I thought it was just me because I'm the type to roll in 5 minutes late everyday and make friendly conversation. Still ridiculously efficient though, the entire kitchen sink is spotless within 10 minutes of my arrival even though the influx of dishes is intense (obviously I'm a dishwasher). But then I learned through talking to my coworkers about it that much of the same happens to them. I should be making $200 on the weekly, but I wind up seeing a $40 here, $80 there, another $20 eventually, and sometimes having those debts continue to carry until they're conveniently forgotten.

I recently got really sick and had to take some time off to be in the hospital. No big deal, I understand that she's gonna find coverage. I came back and she said I'm outta work for 2 weeks. But I asked for the $325 she still owed me as politely as possible and was told that she didn't have it and, with attitude, asked to call before I roll up asking for money next time. Now I've been nothing but understanding and cordial about the fact that I've been getting the shaft on my finances (despite having a girlfriend to support, college payments, gas to pay for, debt from medical bills and other past debts, and a dope habit to support). But the attitude really did it for me. 

So now I'm in a position of looking for a new job again. Worst part is I have a red flag on my employee record whenever I go to apply for jobs, which is another reason I appreciated a decent wage under the table job in the first place. But I can't keep getting fucked on money like this. Not when I got lawyers and collectors calling me looking for money. Fuck that.

So do any of you have any ideas for employment for a red-flagged college sophomore that will allow me to maintain (or at least better manage) my lifestyle? I have plenty of assorted skills, just not any that are regular enough (or legal enough) to make into a career.

Anyway, hope you guys are all doing well out there! I'm finally getting my nod on after 300+mg of morphine, 500mg of codeine, 4mg of clonazepam. About to add in 20mg amphetamine too because I have a bit of work I need to get done.",1400498029.0

Now for the past 6 months I have been craving that opiate high every day, and when I take xanax and smoke my weed it just leave me wanting more, at this point I think my only option is to try the needle, which is what I've been avoiding for the entirety of my drug use, I do not have a consistent hookup and would only like to use at most once every month, the rest of the time taking my suboxone(8mg daily) I know this is just kind of a long rant and it actually feels good getting it out there, but I would like your advice, I would prefer a strong prescription opiate I wouldn't have to bang such a oxycodone or opana but nowadays I cant ind them in this area (Dallas) and even if I did use one a month spending 50-100 on prescription opiates would lead to financial instability, so what should I do? 

TL;DR
Been on 8mg suboxone daily for a year and a half, cant get high off snorting small amounts of dope and am apprehensive about the needle because that seems to be the point of no return for the dope users I have associated with/ still do, do you think snorting/smoking a higher dose(BTH) would get me a nice nod or would i need something stronger

261deb,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/261deb/how_quickly_does_a_tolerance_build/,22,https://redd.it/261deb,Technofascista,How quickly does a tolerance build?,"Hi, I had my first opiate experience last year with oxycodone, it was great and I left it there for about a year when I discovered poppy seed tea, which is also nice.
In the past couple days I've come into some more oxy, the first night I did 10mg and that was pretty strong, no nod or anything but nice. Second night I did 10mg again and it just felt like a standard dose of painkillers, slight euphoria but nothing too great. The next night I did 10mg again and some tea (250g of seeds) which, while being stronger, still wasn't all I expected it to be.
I took a few days off and tonight I've done 20mg of oxy and it's not even comparing to the first 10mg I did. 

My question is not only how long it take a tolerance to build, but if its different for each opioid? Is oxy in particular quick to to come accustomed to? I didn't notice too much of a tolerance when I was doing seed tea for ~4 days in a row, and it was all the same brand and quantity. I know my oxy doses are fairly low, but does the principle apply to higher doses? How quickly did you guys build a tolerance, and what'd you do, just keep stepping it up or move onto something more potent?
Any answers or stories about you're own experience with 'stepping it up', so to speak, would be great. ",1400600650.0

Bizzaire, don't know what to do.","So I was like fuck it, I want drugs and started my journy to upgrade myself from pills to power/tar. I'm on a particular street walking away from a well known festival hoping to catch the eye of a street vendor. i pass a possible subject, and he after a bit turns around yells at me 
""Yo you smoke bud?"" Looking at him, no way in fuck would I have solid him any weed back when I was dealing, instead I suggested I was gonnas ask him almost the same thing 

""You can ask me..."" 
""Heroin"" 
He than asks if I cut it with benadryil or something else. I largely dont get what he means, but say sure benadryil is fine. We chat, especially  about some of the finer point of the drug trade and avoiding detection.   At some point he asks me to lift my shirt up to see if I'm wearing a wire. 

THe street we walk down is clearly a black neiberhood not doin too well. I don't really want to go into teh building for the deal, but he tells me to wat int eh hallwayy so teh police rolling buy wont know whats up. Cool by me. After some bangin, and yelling hes his brother, the door opens. After about another minute I'm brought in, I had my cash over before we meet our man. 

Probelm is, the big man spots me for what I am a mile away, just some fucking dude, who gave a false name, who hasn't known his borther for days. They argue, it gets a bit heated, I try and cool shit down a couple times. Eventually I agree to do a line right there in the apartment to ease tensions. at which point he tells me his G and half G price, along with telling me he sells rigs. But I'm in the his dudes home, thats no small thing imo. He tells me he'll call me later that day, but that he doesnt have a phone, and writes my info down. Says he'll call in a few hours.

This leave me uneasy, but fuck it, I'm a highly educated white boy in one of the poorest streets in STL, not about to bitch about his business model. Especially since I get some H out of it, and I walk away un harmed. 

Now my dilemmia, is this dude clearly isn't gonna, callits been a few days. Stl cold coppin is new to me, I'm thinking of just sliding a note underneath his door thats like "" Hey, call your friends XXXXX XXX-XXX-XXXXX, I' love to hear from you"" . THoughts?",1400576825.0

25zuwl,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/25zuwl/cautionary_tale_involving_tsa/,11,https://redd.it/25zuwl,0PI0ID,Cautionary tale involving TSA,"Some of what I am about to share is due to my fuckup, and some of it is due to my spidey sense going into tingle mode. In all, maybe I am speculating about something that was all in my mind. So with those disclaimers.

I've always struggled with how best to carry my medications. I'm a prescription user, under the care of a pain doctor. I won't go into the details of why I take opiods, other than that I've tried almost every other form of pain management, injections, acupressure, acupuncture, naturopathic medicine, chiropractic, etc. Some of which have made a difference, some of which have not. After years of dealing with my pain issues, and trying many different regimens, with the help of my doctor, I finally settled in on a course of oxycontin with oxycodone for breakthrough pain.

I've been on this regimen for several years and one thing I've always struggled with, is how to manage my inventory. I've got a safe deposit box which I use, because at one point, someone in my family started helping themselves to my meds. I'm not mad, it was my fault for not controlling them better. 

But for travel I am left a little exposed. As was the case today when I was going through a checkpoint at a major metropolitan international airport. Usually at the last second, I will carefully and inconspicuously take my meds and put them deep in my laptop case, secured within a zipped pocket. I carry all my meds in a prescription bottle, the same one the pharmacy gives you. I count out what I need, putting each inside a mini ziplock plastic pill bag. then I put those inside the prescription bottle. It's not uncommon for me to have on my person what would amount to several thousand dollars on the black market. 

Anyways, today, for whatever reason, my paranoia got the best of me, and I decided to carry my meds on my person through the checkpoint, in spite of being clearly instructed not to have anything in pockets. As I completed through the machine, I saw the TSA worker manning the checkpoint looking at me and I got a bad feeling. Sure enough, he tells me that he needs to pat me down. Immediately he finds the bottle, pulls it out of my pocket and asks me what it is. 

I tell him its my meds. He puts the bottle right up to his eyes, and reads the label. Which said Oxycodone. As well he could see the meds inside the bottle in their clear plastic wrapper. He then tells me that they are going to have to run the meds back through the machine. He tells me, ""wait right here"". It was the way he looked at the meds, and the way he said wait right here, and also the way that he carried the meds in his hands, palming them so no one else could see them.

In that split second something told me, if you don't follow him and make a big deal out of staying with your property, your never gonna see your pills again, and that's going to suck big time because its almost a 1/2 months supply. Not to mention the fact that I'd be on shit street for two weeks trying to get my act together. 

So anyways, I did just that. I made a big stank about following him and telling him I wasn't going to let them out of my site. It was awkward as hell, but I honestly think if I hadn't done so, I would have been a victim of robbery. 

I don't know if it was his age, combined with the knowing way that he looked at the bottle, or just my paranoia for being stupid... But to this moment, I am convinced that he was going to end up ""losing"" the pills. Did I fuck up by not following my normal routine? Hell yeah. Did I learn a valuable lesson about following my instinct when I see something not right? Hell Yeah. Any ways, just thought I'd share in the hopes that someone could learn from me being a dipshit. If it keeps one person from losing their meds, and their sanity, then I've done my job.",1400551983.0

I run into this homeless junky kid I hang out with sometimes and he helps me find a gram of some fire. We're just kicking it afterwards, getting high and just generally screwing around, when he asks me to go down to Home Depot with him to help him make some money. Pretty much he wanted to shoplift a couple hundred dollars of shit and then have me return it for store credit, as he knows a guy that will buy the gift cards they give for returns at something like 60% face value  (he needed me to do the returns because he doesn't have an ID). I'm pretty uncomfortable with this idea, as I'm not one to commit crimes in order to support my habit, but he's extremely persistent, telling me it'll be super easy, that he'll throw me a couple points for helping him out, and just generally pushing the idea until I finally relent and tell him I'll help him out. 

We get down there, he goes in and comes out with some drill batteries, something like $250 worth. I put them in my backpack, go into the store, and walk up to the customer service desk. The employee tells me I have to return shit at a counter around the corner. To get to the counter I have to walk through one of those standard shoplifting alarm things, and it starts beeping super loudly. I just kinda freeze, all of the Home Depot employees staring at me, so I decide fuck this and put the batteries back on a shelf and walk out the store, telling my ""friend"" I couldn't do it. 

He gets super pissed off, asking why the hell I put the shit back, that the alarms don't matter at all. He specifically said ""what the hell is wrong with you, I swear, there is seriously something wrong with you"", which stung a little bit and was rather unwarranted in my opinion, especially since I've gotten him well when he was sick a ton of times, given him money for food, let him use my phone to make deals, etc. 'cause I liked the guy and hated to see him down, like he was most of the time. 

He then walks back into the store, and this is where shit gets really shady. Despite how hot the situation has become, he decides to try and steal the batteries again. We're walking out of the store and all of a sudden either an undercover cop or one of the Home Depot employees wearing normal clothes pops out of nowhere and tells my friend to come with him. He tries to run but gets tackled to the ground instantly. I'm just kind've frozen there, staring, until the cop/employee looks at me and says ""Go away. Unless you want to get arrested too"". So I just start walking away while my friend is screaming on the ground, begging them to let him go. 

I felt extremely lucky to not have been caught up as well, but also extremely guilty. Part of me wishes I had the balls to just try and do the return despite the alarms. Part of me wishes I had the balls to just tell my friend no in the first place, that it was a terrible idea, at the very least not to go back in the store again. He did treat me somewhat crappily, but this kid has a pretty fucked-up life to begin with, getting arrested definitely didn't help at all, especially as I'm pretty sure he had some warrants out for stealing shit in the past. 

Sorry for the super long post. Just wanted to share with someone, as I can't talk about this with any of my real life friends (they don't know I use). I just feel terrible that I was involved in this whole stupid ordeal in the first place. 

TL:DR- Watched a friend get arrested for stealing shit from a Home Depot, but was lucky enough not to get arrested myself. Feeling guilty/partially responsible.",1400646778.0

I went down to 100ml and now I'm down to 90ml. i plan on going down to 80ml this week. i still use a point of dope a day. i plan on maintaining the dope since obviously i can't stop. I've written about my plans a couple times. I'm basically trying to get down to 40ml so i can switch to suboxone. my goal is to be down to 40ml by the end of summer. I'm going down 10ml at a time until 70 as recommended by my doctor and then by 5ml at a time until i get to 40ml.

i can tell you that i feel fine. i haven't felt much withdrawal at all, and even then, i think it was the cold i caught. i felt a little sketchy last week when i was sick from a cold and now that I'm feeling better i can see for sure that the sketchy feeling was from the cold. the worst i feel is a slight discomfort during the day which i try to push as long as i can before i do a hit. since going down on my methadone i now feel more euphoria from my dope. i love it but at the same time i wish i didn't feel it. it'll make quitting all the more difficult. 

I'm going down as fast as i can in the beginning while its still easy so i can take more time and go slow later on if i need to. i honestly feel fine and the change in dose hasn't affected me yet. i just hope it stays like this the whole way down. i feel like I'm finally ready to do this and get off dope. I'm sick of being on methadone and being a slave to this. i want to move on with my life. 

hopefully my story can inspire someone to start their journey towards getting clean. ill do a few updates periodically and let you guys know how this is working out for me. if i can do it, you can do it too!

Usually I keep it at about 90-100mg a day, spread out with about 30mg every 3-4 hours.  I've had the ability to easily take more, but I chose not to to keep from spiraling out of control too much. 

A couple of weeks ago, on a day just like any other day, I had taken about 60mgs by evening time, but hadn't taken any in a few hours.  At that point I railed about 10mgs, and immediately felt something was wrong.  My heart rate skyrocketed, I became VERY lightheaded and VERY shaky, a headache, with a very small amount of nausea.  

Assuming I had overdosed, I attempted to make myself throw up but failed.  I spent the next 4-5 hours feeling this way, pacing back and forth wondering if I was going to fall unconscious soon.  It eventually wore off, and I woke up the next day feeling as if I was hungover.  

Having been scared, I took about 5 days off of anything more than 5mg a day.  

Presently, I can start my day with a normal dose of ~30-40mg as usual, but if I have anything more than that for the rest of the day, I'll experience the same effects - lightheaded, shakiness, very very mild nausea, pounding head, hangover-ish feeling the next day.  I've had plenty of times in the past when I've taken too much and puked my ass off of course, but this feels completely different, and it's a seemingly permanent hindrance to my habit.  

Was this an overdose?  If so, how long will these effects last?  If it wasn't an overdose, what the hell is going on?  

Thank you in advance for any guidance or advice.  

**EDIT:**  Thanks guys, I think it's dehydration.  Gonna be pounding water for the next few days until I'm pissing clear again, and I'm sure I'll be back to normal.  ",1400637324.0

I've already made up my mind and am firmly against getting a breast reduction, because aside from the back pain, I absolutely love my tits and body the way they are. The back pain just interferes with a lot of my daily activities, and can make going to work unbearable.

I was hoping to see a doctor about it soon as I just got insurance, but don't know if it will be worth the bother. A lot of the time if it gets too bad and a hot bath/massage/ibuprofen won't help, I'll get painkillers (my weed dealer sells pills on occasion) and it will feel 100000x better and I'll be almost back to normal the day after. I know that's not something I can exactly say to a doctor, but I was hoping now that I had insurance I might be able to get something that I could take more consistently (that also wouldn't force me into a position where I could potentially get arrested for buying narcotics).

Do you think I might get prescribed something for this? What would be the best way to talk to a doctor about it? For those who use opiates legally for pain management, could you give me some details about why you use them/what's helped you/what to expect when seeing a doctor?

I ignore the 65 mile an hour speed-limit that other drivers at least pretend to respect with their 10-over-or-less mentality.

I know where the cops sit and force myself to slow down around those few turns. This stretch of highway is often referred to as “heroin highway,” but what stretch of highway isn't anymore. 

I’m sick. How sick I am balances on what’s left in my body from the heroin I shot roughly half-a-day-ago. The half-life of dope being about 4 hours leaves me with roughly one of the eight bags I shot still hanging around my opiate receptors. Fuckin’ science, no matter what the chic dope addicts tell you remember that using is all science - no art - just ruthless science. From the high to the withdrawal there is nothing about getting high that someone out there can’t explain using some really fucking fancy words.

I look like hell. I flip up the visor deciding to deal with the sun’s glare rather than looking at my grimy strung-out reflection in the mirror. The sun is bright, my headache gets worse and I am fed up with it all. I want to scream and punch and kick but more than anything else I want to fucking cry. I don’t have the energy or the tears. The feeling passes. I turn the radio down, there’s no such thing as distraction - the minutes drag on. I’m yet to experience the hour that goes by slower than the one before scoring.

Fifteen minutes later I’m within a mile of the exit and search for the ticket that the kind toll booth lady hands me every other day. I’ve watched her looks go from polite to piteous over the past half-year. She knows. She can feel the misery that radiates from me when I leave town and the stark difference in my demeanor when I return.  I find the ticket underneath my seat and count out the toll needing pennies to complete the measly buck-thirty-five. To pay the toll on the way back I’ll either short my dealer a buck, or beg a stranger. I’ve blown through the toll-booth’s EZ-Pass enough times to have learned my lesson. I’ll do whatever I need to avoid another $40 ticket, one of the few favors I’m willing to do for the clean me who will have to deal with all of dirty me’s shit. Someday. Hopefully.

I call my dealer to let him know that I am ten minutes away. Snoop doesn’t answer my call and it pisses me off. He works a 40-hour work week and capitalizes on the thousand of white people from the neighboring areas that flock to the small city of Holyoke in-seek of relief. Holyoke - The Birthplace of Volleyball. That is the sign that I am greeted with everytime I enter Holyoke. Sometimes I daydream about spray-painting “drug problems” over volleyball. 

I am within a mile of his usual meeting spot when he calls me back. He tells me to meet him at his secondary spot, the one I passed five miles ago. I tell him I’ll be there in five minutes He does well for himself. He wears expensive urban wear, drives an early ‘00s green Lexus, and has more than one girlfriend. He is over 6 foot and strong. His hair isn’t greasy and he doesn’t smell. He’s spanish. We are not very alike.
I pull into the apartment parking lot on the outskirts of the city. This spot really is a great place to meet in the summer. Fences with thick vines surround the parking lot which is slightly elevated from the surrounding roads. One of his girlfriends live here, she’s a pretty girl. 
He pulls in a minute later and comes up to my window. The exchange isn’t too discreet but I get the feeling Snoop doesn’t worry too much about the police at his two main spots, none of the tenants seem to even notice Snoop on the rare occasion that they are outside when I come through, as if he is some type of heroin carrying spectre. 
He probably makes a thousand a week, maybe two thousand on a great week. The stamp is the same as its been for the past three months, just how this day is the same thing every time - except for when I’m short a few dollars and have to be extra nice. He knows it makes no difference to him, the three dollars here or four dollars there, but he still lets me know to not make a habit of it, which I don’t. Many times I’ve had to ask strangers for a dollar or two for gas to get me home not wanting to be short with my dude twice in a row.

I pull out of the parking lot knowing that I could never make it home before getting high. I’ve done the drug thing in this part of the city long enough to know where the best spots to go are. I drive to a mile further from the city and pull into one of the nicer apartment parking lots with its trees and bushes which I can park my car besides keeping me as inconspicuous as possible.

I tear open my new pack of needles and pull my kit from my backpack. I’m just a minute or two away from being high and I have to focus to steady my hand. I split the tape which keeps every nickel sized bag of dope together. Once the bags are split I line them up together completely unfolded, tearing off the top of seven bags simultaneously. I empty each one out into my cooker admiring the beige color of them. Suddenly the self-hate and hopelessness that I was feeling just a few minutes ago seems like a whole different day. 

I draw the 40 units I need into my syringe being more exact than is necessary.The water mixes with the dope and I stir it with the plunger from my needle. I open my pack of Camels and pull out a cigarette, tearing off a tiny piece of the filter which I roll in between my fingers before dropping it into the brown liquid. I push the point of the needle into the cotton and draw up every bit of the substance that I can.

I pull my arm out of the long sleeved shirt I’m wearing and bring my arm out from the bottom of the shirt. I wrap the sleeve around my bicep while pumping my fist, thankful that my veins haven’t given out yet. I hit a vein within a minute and finally relax when I see the red mushroom cloud entering the chamber. I push down on the plunger and quickly pull the needle out of my arm where a single drop of blood pools at the surface. I turn the radio backup and get lucky when a song I like comes on.

It's been thirty seconds and I suddenly feel what I drove here for, the pins and needles start in my fingertips and toes working their way up my body and hitting me hardest on the lips. Its almost overwhelming and I exhale loudly relishing in the taste of vinegar on the back of my tongue. The dope massages away the tightness in my back and the feelings of inadequacy in my brain and I finally can enjoy the cigarette that I light instead of just smoking it out of habit. The world is my oyster and I’m its pearl for the moment. I don’t linger out of a sudden respect for the people who live here, but as with all of my respect I know its just another fleeting feeling.

I pull out of the parking lot headed to the home which I still have for the moment. I have enough dope to keep me well even past this time tomorrow, but I will have to return unless I want to make the drive sick again the next day. I call a few people I middleman to let them know that all is well and that I will be back in an hour. I hit the highway when I start to think about how I’ll get the money together for tomorrow.",1400618026.0

  I finally got a nostril clear enough to put a line of dope in it, and almost instantly mucous fills the nostril obstructing a lot of my drug absorption. This happens a lot of the time after I snort, and it is very very annoying. Does anyone who has been doing this longer than me happen to have any tips? 

 I know plugging is an option, but I don't like heroin plugged, It feels more like morphine in that ROA in my oppinion. I definitely am not considering starting the needle, too many people have warned me against it.

EDIT: tried mucinex (guafenesin) and it doesn't seem to help at all. It used to always help with my congestion when I was young.",1400610568.0

The logic behind this is that you can only inhale so much smoke at a time, and, because it hits you within 3 - 5 seconds (according to [erowid](https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/heroin/heroin_dose.shtml)), you are supposed to faint before you can get enough heroin into your body to overdose on.

I've read this on forums, and after doing a bit of research on opium, I found that opium overdoses were extremely rare, possibly non-existent. I know heroin is semi-synthetic, but will that logic still apply?

Is this information accurate though?? I'm very concerned about ODing on heroin, but I find it very useful for coming down on meth (its the only drug really strong enough to kill a meth high).

When I smoked weed I felt cool as fuck sat at a table with my stuff all laid out: grinders, pipes and screens, bong, home-made lightbulb vape, baggies, selection of lighters etc, it felt like having a proper hobby with  loads of neat little equipment. 
Even after I stopped enjoying being stoned I carried on smoking for over a year because I loved so much the routine of coming home from work and changing into my sweats and hoodie, neatly setting up all my stuff, lovingly crafting a perfect joint, wrapping myself up in my duvet and, whilst kneeling on my bed, hanging out of the window and smoking, taking in lungfuls of crisp cool air and eyefuls of my neighbourhood.

More important still, I think, than the feeling of being in a cool secret club and walking around knowing you have a secret that would totally upend peoples' opinions of you if they knew, is the predictability.

 We live in a mostly shitty, often intolerably cruel world in which we all constantly have to be on our toes with dozens of things to worry about simultaneously, but when you're chopping up lines or cooking up a shot... well then nothing else matters in the world, your mind is clear and you have a singular focus. Even though it's artificial you at least, for those few minutes, have a *purpose* that takes you away from it all.

It's meditative, almost zen-like in its uncommon ability to put you in a state of such genuine peace and I love it *so* fucking much.

I just read a /r on how there are generics of this pill that could be crushed, and they are manufactured by Endo. I just got a prescription for 5mg pills, but they have been doing absolutely nothing for me. 

P.S. **Does anyone know how to get your pharmacy to order specific generics of this pill without sounding like a junkie? I would like to be able to crush the ER effect once I get a higher dose - divide the powder into reasonable IR doses - and just mix with water.**

About an hour ago I took six of my 5mg pills with a nice, high-fat meal: three eggs mixed with two slices of cheese, plenty of bacon bits, and a heap of coconut oil to fry in. For those of you who don't know - I took an Opana 5 mg last night and ate this same meal, and boy did I feel good. (I also did chew the gummy pill just for kicks). 

So the weird part now is this: I do not feel anything, despite taking a 30mg dose. I have a very high opiate tolerance (taking 80 mg oxy for example), yet these pills seem to do absolutely nothing. None of the pharmacies around my area even had the 5mg ER pill in stock; I'm on state health insurance, and I'd love to know why I got the pot-luck of having them order me brand-name medicine. (Rant end.) =)

So if anyone could help me out with some advice and info on this new drug, it would be great. Just to be clear, I do not take to administering my pills other than orally; however, I'm fine with crushing into water. ;-)

Edit: Just added a shot of vodka to my lemonade. I mixed two shots of cocoa with 10 mg ER yesterday along with 15mg oxy and got knocked out - granted, I only slept two hours the previous night. 

Thanks. 

**Edit: I just researched what I have, and it is the Endo pharma version. Apparently, it's other generic pharmaceuticals that have been distributing Opana that can be crushed. Either way, I ended up with brand-name, so damn.** 

Back to my original goal, then: I need a generic version of the drug. I suppose the state insurance will get tired of paying for brand name and switch me to crushable generics anyhow after a month or two; I probably won't even have to ask the pharmacy, hehe. Although, I'm still wondering whether or not it would sound ridiculous asking for a generic on my next script. After all, my insurance did give me shit about Xanax ER for the cost after about three months, so we'll see. =)",1400839015.0

Please help me :(,"**Warning, long read. Would like advice from people experienced with constipation, even moreso if they have experience with this issue due to suboxone or subutex**

I am posting on a new account here because I am embarrassed about this. I take a crap like once a week, taking it twice is rare for me. This has been going on for almost a year. I would appreciate you take a read at this and speaking your mind if I am damaging my body or mind.

I have a huge constipation issue. I was constipated before taking this medication but it really made it 10x worse. I take subutex 2mg daily (been on it for almost a year) for reasons being for relapse prevention and maintenance, and it is the main cause of my constipation.. I just suffered from it just now, just showered to get clean, and need to post this.

I have to go #2 about once a week, and when I do sometimes it gets really bad. Let me tell you the process I have to endure each week. I just took a horrible one just now and I'm wearing plastic gloves to not contaminate anything....


I sit down on the toilet, grit my teeth horribly, strain my head and push as hard as I can. This usually gets a bit out, but there is a huge mass left to get rid of.... Now this is where it gets gross. Sometimes I am forced to dig out the remaining shit with my hand, to help get it out. This usually helps a bit and then finally when I push super hard it falls out. I look in the toilet and I can't even believe it made it out... it is a hard mass, not soft poo like it normally should be, but extremely hard, with some blood. It is a big relief it gets out, but at the same time I feel like I am damaging my health. This routine has been happening frequently. I have probably had these nightmare #2 sessions about 10-15 times I believe since I started my subutex maintenance. I Let me say I cannot get off it at the moment as it does help me stay clean, this constipation is the #1 downside however and I HATE IT.

This usually clogs the toilet and I am sweaty from exhaustion and am deeply worried of how this affects my mental health. I just took a shower and washed my hands about 10 times with tons of soap to get the crap out of my fingernails (sometimes a tissue doesn't suffice and i actually have to use my fucking nails... I'm sorry if this is gross but it's true and I want to know how bad this is for my body and brain).
    I did read that constipation causes mental fog, and I have experienced that. Also drowsiness, it is extremely hard for me to get up in the morning these days. How about my teeth and the veins in my head too? I clench extremely hard with my teeth just to take a shit, and my veins feel like they are going to explode. I feel like I am doing a considerable amount of damage to my head nerves, my teeth, and my colon. Is this severe? I am not lying about any of this and I posted on an anonymous account due to my embarrassment. I would love anyone experienced on this, and I googled ""digging constipation"" and I feel extremely sad that I am one of the few guys that had to actually literally dig the shit out of my ass.

I would love some advice, I do not have the best diet and that is one thing that can help. But am I doing any serious damage to my body or brain here?

Its not 4am, i took a crap at 2:30am. This shit I'm dealing with needs to stop (no pun intended...) I will eat healthier, more veggies, etc...maybe even lower my dose of bupe... but I am concerned at what damage I have done. 

**I will read all responses in 8 hours, would love to see some helpful replies, thanks**",1400836553.0

My buddies are all graduating and I have two friends who want me to move out with them and I want to so fucking much but I can't until I have a steady paycheck. The only thing going for me is I have a nice little stack in savings but it's not worth shit if I can't work to keep it like it is. The bills add up quick y'know. Heroin was my escape and now after all my withdrawls it's nothing but a sweet unreachable memory constantly nagging my mind. I need out. I need a job. And most above all else I need a fat shot to ease my troubled mind. The independence I dream of is so close but still out of my reach, and I don't know what to do. This post was pointless as hell but you guys are my internet family. Nobody else except poor poor driz knew about my habit and venting this out to people who care is my only therapy. I dream about being able to cold cop as easy as some of yall do, atleast then dr feelgood could put some medicine in my blood stream to keep me happy and motivated on my hunt, but now the only thing on my mind that keeps me going is that 700 a month apartment on the beach.

We're sitting in the car waiting... several minutes pass, and no guy. I see the car he's in sometimes, so I assume he's in one of the houses. Anyway, this SUV starts making its way down the street slowly, and I think maybe my guy's in a different car. Then I see it's two white guys... not who I'm looking for, but I think nothing of it, until the SUV stops. Right next to my car. And the driver pulls out a badge. 

They see our cash sitting in the door handle, and start questioning us and threatening to arrest us. They keep asking who we're meeting, we say we're just waiting for a friend. They tell us it's obvious we're picking up. We don't have any dope on us, but we have rigs and Narcan. Guy asks me to step out of the car and takes my ID. The other guy is questioning my boyfriend. They keep asking over and over again who we're meeting.

Then the dude says, ""You can go. Get out of here and don't come back."" They didn't even search the car. We jet, and my guy calls asking where the fuck I'm at. We tell him what happens and he has us meet him somewhere else. Turns out there was a homicide on the block earlier this week. 

It turned out better than it could have, but my god I was shaken up. At least the cops didn't wait until the deal went down, because we would've been BUSTED.",1400815915.0

Its really potent quality, but I fell into this addiction after chipping successfully for years (1 - 2 times per week). Its making me really unhappy, and I want to quit. Its not even my drug of choice - it makes me irritable, sweaty, and is threatening my job. 

I've only been using IVing H for about a month, but it just ramped up really quickly due to previous periods of straight up addiction. Im going in for evaluation at a suboxone clinic which would be after work.
My goal would be to taper off the suboxone as quickly as possible and move on with my life. 

Alternatively, I have access to copious amounts of morphine, and I have used Tramadol previously to substitute and taper off of serious opiate binges / dependency. My gf, who is very strongly against the suboxone because of the horror stories, has said that she could hold the morphine for me, dole it out and help me taper down to a Tramadol substitution.

What is your experience with, or opinion of Suboxone? I know theres a painful 48 hour period before it is even safe to administer. What are the positives and negatives, aside from the obvious in my situation - putting my gf in the middle of my raging addiction.

Edit: thanks for the responses, all. I was already leaning towards Suboxone, but my gf was dead set against it. This really helped allay her concerns. I went in for the clinic evaluation this morning, and of all the ridiculous conditions they had, they refused to treat me if I stayed on my (prescribed) sleep med, Lunesta. WTF?!? Not a total waste of time, though, as they referred me to a couple of doctors and clinics nearby who induce Suboxone, so I will be able to find one that works for me.

FYI, I am using the [gov site](http://buprenorphine.samhsa.gov/bwns_locator/) that lists all the people who are certified to administer, but it was painful calling around - going into a clinic that was listed under the ""Treatment Programs"" section was really helpful because a) they were able to see me right away and b) they knew what was up and who was active and accessible to get me started.",1400805951.0

One guy - we'll call him Joe - comes in every couple of weeks. I've seen junkies and I've seen JUNKIES. He's the latter. Shaking, sweating, panicked. 

Joe's a great customer though. First time he came in, he sold me an iPhone 4S for $30. They were going for 20 times that. He'll take almost anything if he's desperate enough and I'm firm enough. 

As far as I can tell though, he's not a thief...so recently all he's had is junk. Anything worth selling is long gone.

Today Joe came in and I rolled my eyes, wondering what shit he was trying to sell today (recently he tried to pawn 5 VHS tapes). 

Imagine my surprise when he pulled out a comic book that I know is worth almost $3k to collectors. Unfortunately, he seemed to know it too. Hopefully not the full value, but he knew it wasn't junk. I offered him $10 to start, hoping he had no idea what he had. He refused (normal negotiating for him). I went up to $15, still no. $20 final offer. He refused. He's never done this before.

I wanted to carry on playing dumb, so I told him I couldn't go higher because that's all it's worth - but to bring it back tomorrow and I'd sleep on it.

So, I was thinking. It's a lot easier for an addict to turn down cash, than product. I think he'd find it very hard not to hand over the comic in that situation and I could make a very nice profit obviously.

Is there some sort of opiate tablet (under $50 ideally) that could change his mind? You can see I have no idea what I'm talking about. I mean like a bottle of 1972 Marseilles wine, but in opiate form. A really good one basically.",1400909490.0

I know, I know...yet another song that's either about dope or enjoyable to listen to while on dope. But I'll bring something else to the table...the song and a content idea for the sub. 

Tried picking something that's likely a little less familiar to folks (and something I personally haven't seen posted here before).

**The Song:** ""She's Like Heroin To Me"" by The Gun Club is one of quintessential tracks from their most revered and critically-acclaimed album (also their debut record) entitled *Fire of Love.* The song definitely doesn't fall in line stylistically with the majority of songs about heroin or general opiate culture - its foundation is a fast, hard and upbeat punk-rock tune, but it also includes several elements from a few different American music genres (more on that later).

Lyrically, Jeffrey Lee Pierce compares a woman-friend of his to the feeling of using IV heroin...though sometimes I think the woman-friend he's referring to might just be a metaphor for dope lol.

The Gun Club weren't the most well-known band, however they had/have a pretty passionate core group of fans...several musicians, critics and historians credit TGC with breaking new ground by combining elements of 70s punk, rock, and most notably several classically southern styles like blues, country and even folk. The band was led by a legendary entertainer and eccentric named Jeffrey Lee Pierce. Pierce struggled with all sorts of addictions, including heroin. He died at age 37 of a brain hemorrhage (people often talked about his periods of terrible health...probably didn't help that his liver was shot among several other things). 

**Idea:** I know there are lots of people on here that are really passionate about music in general - but also interested in opiates, drug culture and how the two can affect and/or influence musicians and their art.

I think it would be cool if we found a way to organize musical recommendations. We could even do something as simple as a daily post (could be something like my post title ""Daily Dope Track,"" which is so full of worthless puns I don't know whether to laugh or cry) that features a song and provides a little bit of relevant info - lyrical context/analysis, band history, etc.

Not entirely sure how we'd manage the daily series, but most likely I'd have people who are interested just come forward and we could develop a schedule.

And again, I think it would be cool if we made this a content-series that provides more than just a song name and a link. A couple paragraphs of interesting info relating to the song/band and how it relates to the collective interests of our sub would be ideal.

Anyways, just a simple thought. If there isn't a lot of interest, no worries. I do think it would be cool, however if we thought about recurring content we could develop to keep the sub fresh. Though I do love to read about how long one must wait until they can get high after taking Suboxone & people in need of passing a drug test in a few hours :) hehe

Have a great Friday night and enjoy The Gun Club :)

I know a lot of ECP users don't heat their dope so I see how you can use anything pretty much, but for those of you who choose to heat your dope for whatever reason, what is your preferred cooker of choice?  Personally, I'ved used spoons the most in the past, but I've come to not like them, my favorite cookers are the ones they give out at needle exchanges but I've never been to one, just have gotten them from those who have gone, and they are the shit, especially when you rig up a handle to it in order to not burn your fingerers.  Lately I've been using the bottom of a coke can.  I've used cans in the past but only in situations where I had nothing else, in those situations I've also used snaffle caps, which work pretty damn good as well.  But lately I've been using the bottom of a can that I rigged up to have a nice handle, and the little ridge around it where I can wipe off the cotton without touching it with my fingers.  Some things concern me about using it though.  Frist, there is ink print on the can with the date, and then a random smudge of a certain color, on mostly every can of soda.  I try to add water and heat them up with water and then try to wipe off the ink but it's hard to..After a while of using it the ink has disappeared, hopefully stopped by the cotton filter....Well, another question to y'all would be how long should I be using this can?  I've been using it for about 4-5 days now, at least 3 times a day.  I clean it about every other day and I throw away my cottons, I never save them...But are these cans safe to use as cookers for an extended period of time, or at all even?

Also, some advice I found for my fellow crack lovers.","Okay this might be a little long to read but I just want to share some  things I found out, and just express my elation. Anyway, my paycheck came in today and I decided to spend it all on drugs lol.  I was chillin at my dude's house and I picked up five 20 bags of some fire crack and a gram of dope. The kicker is that I also brought along a klonopin 1mg that my friend just gave to me. Had an amazing rock sesh, and many bell ringers were had. BUT, I didn't push it once thought the whole sesh, so there was a shit ton of resin in the stem. Now for those of you who don't smoke rock, pushin means pushing the chore boy to collect the crack resin, an often times the push hits are stronger than normal hits. When I was down to my last rock, I prepped my shot and set it down. I then proceded to push the stem, gathering all the precious resin for my next hit. I then put a rock ON TOP of the already massive push hit. I was half chubbed just looking at it. I then commenced with the poor man's speedball: I took the fattest blast off the pipe, grabbed my pre-prepped shot, held that deliciously sweet smoke in, registered, and pushed down that plunger. the most intense euphoria ensued. Absolutely indescribable. After that i popped a kpin and 30 mins later, my high increased 10 fold. Everyone knows about benzos and opiates, and I have tried dope and Xanax, but damn, kpin was much better. Just an amazing time overall.



Now onto the advice for novice crack lovers.  I've only been smoking rock for like a month, but trust me on this one. In short, don't buy more than 2 or 3 twenty bags at a time. Really, just don't. I was planning on saving 2 of those five bags for later, but as you know, your gonna end up doing it all in one sitting, no matter what. After two or 3 bags, you really just stop feeling the full effects and are basically wasting crack.  So just dont bring enough money for more than 2-3 bags, trust me. And for people who haven't done so yet, do the poorman's speedball. You won't regret it.  Thanks for those who read this, and have a very euphoric weekend!



TL;DR: Had a great crack sesh ended by a poorman's speedball and topped off with some kpin that made my dope high amazing. Also, don't buy more than three 20 bags of rock at one time and try the PM speedball as soon as you get the chance haha.",1400890421.0

and then today. fucking today. i buy a large iced chai latte at starbucks and go to work. it was mega busy. i turn around to put shit away and when i turn back around i realize my iced chai got knocked over onto my beautiful apple macbook pro. commence freakout. it was literally over 3/4 of my keyboard. i start having a panic attack and i wipe my computer down with kleenex (had some in my purse thank god) and later get some scott towels. then i wash the outside of my computer. i let it rest upside down in a boss's office while i go back to work. went to the apple store genius bar. thankfully all tests came back good. no damage whatsoever. all the keys work, laptop works, and the keys don't even stick when pressed. but they do tell me that in the future the sugar might eat away at the metal and so i might end up with problems because of that even though everything is fine today.

I started smoking H back in November 2012, and started IV'ing sometime in January of this year. At first, IV'ing would make it so I would be well for around 9 hours, which at the time made it seem like I'd be able to save money on H as it lasted longer than smoking. 

The problem is, I think I'm as addicted to the ritual of prepping my shot as I am to the drug itself. For example, I'll buy $X worth of H on my payday (a Friday) and I'll rationalize and justify to myself to keep on re-dosing even though I'm already high. As such, I end up going though my stash by Satuday evening if I'm lucky.

I made this username just to be a able to make comments (and now to post) on this sub and another sub regarding alcohol. 

I know there others like me but heroin make me hyper like oxy. For example I feel compelled to clean, organize, fix stuff, and generally take care of stuff I have been putting off but feel great while doing it. It's almost like an upper without all the things I hate and avoid with uppers. This has it's advantage and disadvantages. A big disadvantage is I have very hard time sleeping while high. My mind races and I can't sit still. I would like to be able to a get a good nod going but I'm unable to and rarely do. I have been able to have nods but that's only if I'm already exhausted or take a very large dose of H. And, I rarely take large doses because it's few and far between that have the opportunity to use with others. Even if I'm lucky enough to use around others they don't have Narcan. So, while using with others it's unlikely I would die but i'd still have to endure a hospital visit and bill. The benefits of aiming for nice nod just don't justify the risk.

My other problem is that I have had sleep issues for the past decade whether I'm high or not. I have taken Ambien in the past and it doesn't do a lot for me. It helps me sleep vs. taking nothing but definitely doesn't put me out like some people or do what it's prescribed to do. The one drug that really helps with my sleep issue is Xanax but I don't have much access to that and I won't even mess around with low doses of benzos and H...too many sad and scary results.  Anyway, I goggled the combo of Ambien +H and it says it's not very safe. But I couldn't find info on my somewhat opposite reaction to H, reduced results to Ambien, and especially the combo. I wondered if anyone else had my same issue or had first hand experience.


MAIN QUESTION/ TL;DR--> As someone that H makes mildly hyper/amped up/ have an even harder time sleeping than usual, etc. and that Ambien doesn't have a strong effect on, is it dangerous to combine my standard dose of ~.2H and 12.5mg AmbienCR?

Side question: Is anyone educated on whether or not if H makes you hyper vs. sedated on respiratory function? Just because H makes me much more active and have a harder sleeing than most am I at the same risk of stopping breathing/ ODing with or without Ambien? Sorry for the run-on question as I'm pretty buzzed now. Thanks everyone and stay safe!

So, anyone have personal experience with AH-7921 or know someone personally who does? Do you recommend it, is it still legal in the USA, are there any better alternatives? I doubt this sub allows people to mention where they would buy it, but is it readily available, legally?

I miss real opiates, but honestly, after seeing my friend get arrested and almost put in jail, I can't risk anything illegal at this point in my life, or anything that could destroy my career. I really wish I could mess with some H or OC, but I just can't anymore. I can order kratom straight to my fucking work, and actually tell people I take it as some alternative medicine, and not get looked at like a fucking junky.

I picked up today after being clean/on subs for 3 days. I took 16mg yesterday morning and I was in withdrawal by night time some how. I took 8mg Thursday night and kinda had PWDs but not too bad. Then yesterday morning I plugged 8mg and took 8mg via sublingually. Like I said by last night I was in withdrawal again. I didn't sleep a wink last night and was in full blown WD by the afternoon today. I'm telling myself that these 2 buns are my last for a while. I gotta do this because I am too familiar where this shit always leads but it's hard to quit when you're in the no consequences phase when you still have a job and aren't spending more than you have and such.

I kind of wandered over from /r/Drugs and other related subs because I'm genuinely interested in the opiate experience. I've mostly been on the stimulant/psychedelic side of the drug realm so far, and while I have never found things like amphetamine or mdma in any way addictive for me, I have to admit that I am a bit hesitant when it comes to opiates. Simply because I have *no* idea what addiction feels like, so I have no frame of reference from which to judge and therefore I am hesitant. I read some of your posts here, and people openly admit to being addicts and that it sucks. I have to say, that feels a bit scary. 

I've gone through periods where I've had 2-3 weeks of drinking alcohol almost every evening, anywhere between 3-10 'units' of it, and at the end of those periods I definitely felt an urge for alcohol that wasn't there before. I've always equated that with the humble beginnings of a dependency, and took some time off from drinking afterwards. That's the closest I can relate.

Still, I would like to try it sometimes. What do you recommend for me? I see a lot regarding oxycodone, which seems interesting to me as it's obtainable, probably easy to administer and pharmaceutical grade. What dose should I be looking at? How to administer? Or should I be considering something else, or perhaps nothing at all?

I'm interested in hearing your opinions.

Then near the injection site my skin breaks out in lighter colored raised up welts.. if you've missed before you probably see something similar. If I touch my skin there its warmer than the rest of my arm.

You just cut a hole in a water bottle, use pliers or something to hold the pill through the hole, and stick the dremel down the drinking whole of the bottle to pulverize through the new ER technology.

I'm too lazy for all that, and I do not snort or inject my meds. The experiment I'm currently conducting is just involving some purified water with my 5mg Opana ER inside and about a teaspoon and 1/2 of baking soda. It's been 8 hours or so, and all the pink coating is off, and I'm left with this... clear blob. 

Here's the problem: I have no idea which part is the Oxymorphone, haha. Common sense would have me assume the pink coating was the ER component, but what's with the blob? Is that the medicine, or is the medicine incorporated into the pink crap?

This is by far my favorite community so I figured I would update those interested and those that gave me useful advice. So for those that don't know, I have been in a somewhat abusive and just generally negative relationship with my girlfriend. She has been caught lying to me multiple times and stealing my dope that I paid for in my sleep. For that past couple weeks, I have been hanging out with my dboy/best friend every day. While I'm with him, she'll call me and if she doesn't like the way I answer her questions, I'd hang up and put my phone on ""do not disturb"" mode and she will call me literally non stop for hours. She has been treating me like shit for weeks and just being generally shitty to me when I have done nothing to provoke her at all. Her mood swings are generally 100 times worse when she's on dope, so I've been trying to give her as little as possible while keeping most for myself. So now for the main event. Friday night, I went and helped my man run some errands and didn't get home till late. I have been using my moms car for the past 2 weeks so that my girl can use my car to get to driving school. Well when I come inside, I start taking my clothes off to get into bed with her and my daughter. While doing that, she grabs my phone and starts doing something. She then tells me she deleted all my photos of her and my daughter off my phone. I get really upset by that and then ask for my car keys so I can go outside and smoke a cigarette. She refuses to give me the keys so I start looking for them. When I find them she jumps out of the bed and starts hurting me to get them back. At this point I'm really upset and the commotion wakes up my daughter. I get ahold of the keys and start outside when her mom comes up the steps. I cuss out my girl and go outside. My girl is right behind me and she tries to get the keys back again. So she manages to unlock the car and hops inside. I get mad and hit the car a few times out of frustration. Then her mother comes outside with my daughter in her arms which just sends me overboard. I ask her what the fuck she is doing and to take her back inside. So she refuses and then her father comes outside also. So I let them all know how I feel about them and drive off in my mothers car. My father has custody of my daughter so I told him what happened and that I want him to come pick her up in the morning. So right now I am staying at my mothers house and I am officially done with this bitch. I know I could have handled the situation better but at least now I won't go back to her even if I wanted to. So now I guess I'm back on the market and finally free of this poisonous relationship. So I just thought I'd let everyone that is familiar with my story know that I'm out and free to so my own thing now. Sorry for the wall of text as always and thank you r/opiates for listening.

Me and my mom got her off but she started using percs again about 4 months ago. I kept telling her to try and stay off that shit and I know she wants to because its too expensive for her but she loves opiates. I'm concerned but I never wanted to pressure her to stop because I know she wouldn't that easy.

Well this morning she calls me crying because her boyfriend of a year and a half left her. She kinda had the raspy fucked up voice I'm used to hearing when she's been partying the night before. I didn't mention anything about not using drugs while she's going through this break up but I have a good feeling that she's gonna dive deeper back into her opiate addiction in result of it. 

Really I guess what I'm asking is what can I do for her as far as trying to wean her off Perc 30s right now before she starts tryin to get back into the harder shit. I think I do alright with oral support. I dont ever pressure her to get off the shit she knows how bad it can be she's perfectly aware but she has severe abandonment  issues which I think is one of the biggest problems with her drug use. Also is there any pills or anything I can get online or from SR to help wean her off? last time she went into detox she would get suboxone or subutex I dont remember exactly what they were called. 

Thanks alot guys I love my lil sister I dont have a problem with opiates at all but I just dont want her to do anything dumb while shes going through her shit, and I know she wants to get off she wouldn't tell me she wants to otherwise.

TL;DR my sister is back on opiates and just got dumped wanna help her get off before it becomes a bigger problem

edit: she literally just texted me she's getting a bunch of drugs today.

My bags have only ever been short twice, and the only reason they were short is because she knew it wasn't for me. I was clean at the time and helping out some friends. (really though, short to me is on point. I'm spoiled with fat bags). Anyways, I woke up sick as a mother fucker today. I did a pretty decent wash around midnight last night so really I didn't expect to be THIS sick. It was just my birthday, and I got a fuck ton of gift cards i don't want or need. So i texted my girl and asked her if I could trade her 100$ of gift cards for 50$ worth of dope. She said no, because she hadn't made much money this weekend. So I'm like fuck it I'm just gonna ask for a front instead and pay her back tonight, and she said yes. I've never asked for a front before, and I'm so goddamn happy she said yes. AND she's delivering.

I can’t remember much of what I did this weekend. It’s all a blur, an unfulfilling blur though it went on seamlessly. The parties were fun, the benzos effective in numbing me to the world. There was of course still the inherent anxiety of facing this world stilted by some prescription pill or warm keg. Clumsy attempts at talking to girls. Awkward dumbed down conversations fueled by sedate states. Intoxication to engage socially is among our most bizarre habits. Endlessly romanticized, meaningless, and the source of much pain, yet romanticized none the less. Perhaps it’s the warmth, or the feeling of excitement and the exuberance, but I think it’s all the damn optimism. The scourge of man and the most wonderful thing in the world has to be the belief that things will get better. Perhaps love is more wonderful and dangerous especially for the optimist. I’ve seen people searching fruitlessly in dive bars and dirty house parties for love.

I'm not going to stop, and due to personal reasons in my life I can't readily use other opiates.

My doc is buprenorphine. Recently, a family member received around a hundred 10ml syringes with saline flush. Now, knowing how bad it is for me, I'd like to know, is it worth it to flush my veins after an injection? Will it help longevity of them, or will it just make the scar tissue build up quicker? I have horrendous veins through my body, even prior to IV use, so I'd like to preserve the few ""Ol Faithfuls"" I have left. I've taken to mixing my drugs with the saline solution, but I also have access to sterile water vials occasionally, too.

Anyway, any input on the use of the saline/sterile water as a post-injection flush would be greatly appreciated.

I know that r/opiates is about using opiates, but I also think a big part of this sub is about getting clean and helping each other get clean when we are ready to take that step.  

I got some of these things on the list from another post on r/opiates because that other post got me thinking.  I am doing this because I am very shortly going to be going inpatient for a long time as soon as tomorrow and latest mid next week.  Basically I am just writing down ideas that I want to remind myself of when I am having trouble so i can stay strong and say no to drugs because this addiction at the moment has complete control of me and I need to fight it off.  

So far this is my list:

1) It takes a lot of courage, but the withdrawals are worse in my head then they really are.

2) I have to remember that the person I was before drugs will come back once I have some sober time under my belt as he was always there, but just in hiding when i was using 

3) I want to be able to say that I fought heroin and won

4) I am a Man I have control over my body and nothing else has control or every will 

5) No Time for self pity 

6) If I am having a tough time talk about it with someone or look myself in the mirror and remind myself of who I am and what I want to be.  

Please add to my list any response will be apprecaited.

This is my first post but I have read/lurked for a long time. Please hear me out before deciding what I am doing wrong ;)

Here is my situation:

Zero opiate tolerance. As in no opiates in years, at all.

Landed myself some 'good' ECP. I know it is at least 'good' because I scored it from someone who knows their shit, hah. They do not seem to fuck around. One of the stamps hold a light tan color, sweet smelling powder. The other stamps are mostly white, lighter in color than the other.

ROA: Insufflation. I avoid drip by barely breathing in and I feel it stop where I want it, if that makes sense. So, I am not just swallowing it.

When I do it, I do ~match head size bump up one side. I wait 15-20 minutes, then do another the same size up the other side.

I basically repeat this a few times in hopes of feeling... something... anything... but I always just end up going from sober, to 5-6 bumps later, having an ear pounding head ache, bad nausea (only if I walk) and light shakes.

My eyes pin and the 'bad' side effects seem to match what dope will do, but after a few sessions of doing this (one time it was 2 nights in a row, the other times about a week apart) I always have the same result.

The last time I did it I made a point to only do 3 bumps spaced out and then stop. Same thing, only with less of the bad side effects... still no good feeling at all. I assume it should feel good to a new user at some point? Otherwise what the hell are you all doing ;) haha. JK.

I am not on any other medication and do not take as much as a tylenol for, well, anything. I figured I would need to build at least some tolerance up first, but I am not sure on the timing for that, so if you have any advice, let me know, since my efforts are not working.

Also, I am not at risk at all of becoming an addict. Sounds naive, but I will only sniff and this was just a one-off chance to score. I have never seen dope until this and likely will not ever again, as long as I live where I do. So, I would just like to experience whatever good this ECP can do and then I will move on.

I don't really know where to start, but anyways: I'd like to ask -- and I know it's not smart to self-medicate, all that jazz. I've heard it all! -- if there's anyone here who would say it's okay to just try an opiate out every once in a while for these issues.

 I'd say myself that I have some pretty good self-control with using substances because I suffer from anhedonia, and unless the substance happens to treat my anhedonia, I will most likely not get addicted to it. Some of the things I've tried that were said to have some potential for abuse were ketamine, MXE, and phenibut, and and of course, they didn't do much for my anhedonia and therefore I didn't really continue with the use.

I know opiates can cause anhedonia during withdrawal and stuff, so it might be kinda ironic to even think about it. But hey, I'm willing to exhaust my options... If you're already at a low point at your life where nothing really matters, what can I do but just try everything I have on me? That being said, I probably won't get addicted as I don't really have a way to get it (except for online and that might be pricey, I dunno prices for opiates) and I really only have something that's supposedly a Vicodin but only 325mg of Acetaminophen instead of 500mg (Norco 5-325). Dunno how much difference that is compared to a Vicodin or is it any better but I have never done any opiates (afaik) so I dunno jack shit about em.

The reason why I just want to try it is to see if it can give any relief from my supposedly impossible to treat anhedonia (from what I've been going through). I mean, I'd love to stay optimistic but at times I don't know if I'm just lying to myself. Anyways, if it does happen to help, then I know that it's something wrong with my brain chemistry and it could be helped through the use of ""drugs""... I'd love to learn more about how opiates affect your brain and the opioid receptors (but moreso neuroscience).

I'm aware of getting addicted but I'm sure I'll be able to handle it... Even if the thing only works temporarily or during the time I'm high, that at least tells me something. I don't really get into using things everyday if it's like that.

Anyways, hope some of you guys have some experiences with using it every once in a while. Or if anyone wishes to chime in, I'd appreciate it. Thanks!",1401285132.0

26o9o6,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/26o9o6/withdrawal_comparison_hydromorphone_vs_heroin/,14,https://redd.it/26o9o6,Agalol,"Withdrawal Comparison, Hydromorphone vs. Heroin","I was curious which of these would be the worse withdrawal considered usually. Normally Dills, after 3 days of decent usage ( 8-16mg a day intranasal) will give me withdrawal. Normally I use about 20 8mg over the span of a week, than have a kinda crappy day or two and am in the clear after that. 

Recently I switched to heroin intranasal, and I have stayed at I think a daily rate that is constant. But over the ten days of heroin use ( a while gap between it and the last opiate usage) i've used at most  4.5 grams, with 45mg robotussin (I read this helps keep tolerance and withdrawal down when stopping).  Problem is Heroin is costing me too much, and I need to manage my money better so I need to try and stop. 

Now the question I am wondering if how bad the withdrawal is usually compared to hydromorphone. Is hydro considered worse of a withdrawal or better? With Roxi it feels like I can use heavily for 2 or 3 weeks and barely feel any withdrawl, but with Hydro it is super fast that the mental desire to use,a nd the physical symptoms have shown up. I'm not out of H yet, but I'd say the mental desire when I haven't used in a while is much lower, and I'm worried about how it will be if I cold turkey, or if I should just use the end to chipper down.

Just wanted to talk about subutex.,"First let me say I'm not normally a long term user but found myself depressed and before I knew it I had done a roxi (30) everyday for about a month. (most I've done is a week consecutively before this) This may not seem like a lot but for me it is and I find the withdrawals were awful. However for the first time since I started using (on and off for a few years) someone offered me a few lines of subutex. At first I didn't think I needed it because it had been 3 days since my last dose and I was already through the ""tough"" part but the lack of sleep was getting to me so I honked half of what he gave me and WOW did it do the trick. I didn't realise how depressed and anxious I really was until the sub kicked in. Everything melted away and not only did I feel much better (motivated, happy, sleeping fine) but I got a nod going that I haven't gotten since the first 1 or 2 pills at the beginning of my binge. It was a different buzz but it's great. I'm so surprised people can use this stuff and go back to opiates. It's like cheating. Anyway thats my experience with subs and if you're hurting like I was don't suffer anymore and take some of this miracle drug!

This causes INTENSE pain, it's happened to me about 5 times over the last 4 months.   I've tried everything I can but I guess they don't call it recurring for nothing.  I""ve been to the eye doctor at least 10 times, probably vcloser to 15-20.  Basically if you can't get an appt to the eye doctor right away so they can give you numbing drops and a bandage contact lens, you spend your day with your face in a pillow trying not to move your head so your eyes don't scrape.   If you open your eyes, tears happen, and tears burn unmercifully...If you move your head, your eyes still move inside your skull and scrape...which hurts unmercifully.  And the best part is without a bandage lens, I can't open my eyes enough to do my shot of dope.  

Luckily todays incident wasn't as bad, if it happened over the long weekend I""d have been fucked.   I woke up this morning, felt it tear my eye off before I even opened my eyes.  LUckily was able to get an emergency appt at eye doctor.  So now, I get to go in for another procedure called a diamond burr, where they will grind down my entire cornea and let it regrow from scratch...a diamond burr is basically a dremel tool..in..my..fucking...eye.  

Oh well, the pain stops immediately once the bandage is in, so theres that...I can at least ""medicate"" now...Also some dude randomly knocked on our door today and asked if he could mow my lawn...I could tell he was one of us, offered him 2 points to mow the lawn...now the yard is tip top and I found a new connect in my home town...joy.

Let's break this down, ""Intention of enhancing life"", okay so you're supposed to be miserable. 1A - Increasing euphoria, there are fews ways to feel ""normally high on life"" such as dopamine release from running.  What if people are wheelchair bound and they can't escape there mind, they can't move.  2A - Blocking unhappy memories, so this works for PTSD.  You had a bad war experience, you had a rape, you have had a life changing event in health or quality of life. And you don't want worthless, and you just want to escape that experience you keep daydreaming about and having nightmares at night, reliving every moment.  3A - Creating pleasure, since when do we not want to have pleasure in our lives?  This goes back to being miserable all the time.  Since when did we lose euphoria and pleasure in this country?  When Nixon started a war he could never win.  Stop saying everythings taboo, it's difficult to say the word ""Drug"" anywhere, even though the most violent and addicting drugs, alcohol and nicotine, (are called by there names because people don't want to call them ""drugs), are the most used and abused daily.  Was there a real drug problem before Nixon started the war? No.  It was formed on racial profiling (your white daughter is going to like a black man), bigotry, and wanting to control the medical indutrsy (since when can you not grow your own medicine, the medical history and medicine was founded on lies and has little to on value today)  and most industries, like ford not being able to produce his hemp car (10x stronger than steel) that ran on hemp oil (environmentally friendly), can make a biodegradeable plastic, for water bottles, or most other uses.  1 waterbottle takes 500 years to degrade.  How are we going to have room on this earth with more people, more graves, and more landfills.  People need to rethink the world, and shape it for the future.  Drugs, the ones that are ""outlawed"" should be used by the medicine industry, not the police force.  I am writing this after two years of pain use, learning everything there is about pain and how to treat it.  Sanjay gupta,  is an American neurosurgeon and an assistant professor of neurosurgery at Emory University School of Medicine and associate chief of the neurosurgery service at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia., says ""We have been terribly and systematically misled for nearly 70 years in the United States, and I apologize for my own role in that."" Was there a pill addiction problem, a cannibis use problem, a heroin use problem when Nixon started the war? Hmm. Also, respect for the law.  This law is universally looked at as wrong, so kids are smoking weed and drinking at a young age, thinking they are hard and have no respect for the law.

Also I would recommend watching these 2 if you haven't already:

For the past 2 years that I've lurked and posted, I've seen a lot of discussions on prices and how they differ by region, country, etc. I'm sure a lot of you guys already know all this stuff, but I didn't until now so I thought I'd share my first personal experience.

As some of you might remember, I've only done dope in Arizona, where I've been for the past 9 months. I've NEVER paid more than $80 a g down there, whether it's tar or gunpowder. So naturally, I was pretty horrified when I started looking into purchasing up in Wisconsin (in a major city, too) and the cheapest I could find for only .5 was $100! 

I mean, obviously I assumed the dope must be better, but it wasn't ECP or anything, and a price difference of 2.5 times as much seemed crazy. I always joked to my concerned sober friends that I couldn't afford to be a heroin addict in Wisconsin (so they shouldn't worry lol), but I honestly would wonder how people could manage it.

Well, I finally decided to get some after being here for a couple weeks and already bored of coke (seriously, fuck coke), and I was pleasantly surprised! For $100 I got a rock of pale tan powder (the outside had flecks of white too). I should have taken a picture…but it's gone now :(. It was definitely bigger than any .5 chunk of tar I've gotten, and it was so dense that I ended up shaving powder off the side with a razor to snort. Kind of like grating cheese haha.

0.1-0.15 got me good and high. Now, I HAD been sober for a couple weeks…but I also purchased .5 of tar once in Arizona after being clean in WI for a month and smoked it in one night. I wouldn't say it was necessarily eeeasy…seeing as I then couldn't move from my bed for the next day and a half, but if I had done that with the shit I just got here in WI I'd be very dead! 

Anyways, the moral of the story is shits cut a lot down in AZ. The end!

TLDR; the dope was good enough to offset the crazy price

What are your guys's experiences with this? Did you get .5 for $100 (or more) and it wasn't any better?

I was stopped at a red light, with four cars in front of me, and nobody  behind me.  When the light turned green, the car(s) took an unusually long time to get started moving across the intersection. I leaned forward to see if I could get a better view of the holdup when, all of a sudden my fucking back window exploded and I was thrown back into my seat. This dude in a 2500 Ram truck slammed into my jeep liberty. The shattering glass kinda cut me up a bit, but at the time I was ok.  I pulled through the intersection after it cleared and this guy followed me. He gets out of the car and says ""aww man I can't afford another one of these. Sorry I was not paying attention. ""  we exchange info, and pretty much go on our ways. I didn't want to call the cops because I was holding, and he probably didn't want to call the cops because he seemed like the type that always has the worst luck in those situations. Either way, about a half hour later he calls me and says ""can you not call that in until Tomorrow?"" I said
Whatever, and we hung up.  Later that night I get home and tell my wife that story and she goes ""you need to call the insurance company  right now"" and honestly, by this point i was thinking the same thing.

So I am a 25 year old guy, who began using opiate when I was 18 and by 19 I had already developed a pretty ridiculous addiction to snorting oxys. My father passed away when I was 18 and left me a good size of money, so my drug habit was fairly well funded, and by 20 I was injecting around 600mgs of oxy on a regular day and 800mgs to 1000mgs on a good day, after a while I usually would have more good days than regular days. This high tolerance lasted for several years non-stop until poor finacial decision eventually left me broke a little over 2 years ago now. My use yhough has continued on a regular bases though at a muvh lowrr tolerance. What I am trying to get at here is that I am no new commer to opiates and feel like I qualify tobbe pretty experienced when it comes to it, and over the past 7 years I have never had any real scares overdosing. Now I have viewed people and close friends overdose, and have known some peopleto die from this. Well today I wad looking for some shit, and heroin has never been to good around my area. Now I have done it plenty and plenty of time though mostly have always stuck to pills due yo the quality and how over priced our ECP is. Though yoday I couldnt find any pills right away but a girl I was hanging out with today just recently got a new connect on some pretty damn good ECP and for a good price, for my area. I decided to get some ahd try it out for the first time in about a year. I just bought 40 bucks worth a did it in a single shot, an amount I would never even think twice about being to large for my current tolerance.  Well long story short with in 2 or 3 minutecafter doing my shot and after the rush wrnt away I apparently passed straight out. I began gasping for air and turning blue. The girl I was with, who had also just done the exact same size shot and who was feeling just great, obviously began to freak out. She took my pulse and said there was almost not one. She began to yell out my name and shake me trying to get me up. As you could assume I was completely unresponsive.  She then began cpr on me and after a min or two I guess started to call 911. Now we have a bottle of naloxen we had recived from someone on this fourm, thank you very much, but it was at the house and we were parked in her girl in a parking lot. Anyways right before help picked up I completely regsin consciousness and wad breathing relatively normal again. I had no fucking clue at all anything had happend at all. The last thing I remember was recapping my shit and putting my equipment away and though I had knodded off for just a few seconds, but when I opend my eyes I saw the girl cry and freaking the fuck out. She said she honestly believef she was about to witnessnme die. Anyways it didnt really register with me what had happend to many hours later. I have always known my limits and while my tolerance isnt sky high anymore, ni still use several times a day and am always careful. Like I said earlier I dont even remember ever having a close call. But anyways my point is everyone please be careful out there. I have really been thinking a lot the past few hours and life is very precious.  I have been wanting to make a appt with the sub doctor for the past month or so but keep putting it off.honestly I dont want to quit doing pills at all, I love them so much, but I am tired of working my ass off 50 hours a weekvjust to be a fucking broke piece of shit in debt. Ive been wanting to make some changes in my life for a shile now because I have a decent job and make alright money, but you wouldnt know it byvlooking at me. Anyways what had happend today finallyvgave me enough encouragment and motovation to make my suboxen doctor appointment and to hopefully start making some fucking changes in my life soon. Sorry my post is so long, I just felt like sharing it with you guys. Everyone be safe tonight

I was able to get-
 48 mgs of lope. 
19 mg sub.
two 2 mg xanie ladders 
five 0.5 xanies..

 How would you tamper?
Lope first or sub? Plz reply as I'm totally unfamiliar with lope and done with the lifestyle. (I can also maybe get 4 or 8 more mgs of sub tomorrow)
but I'd rather go for lope in the end if necessary and if it's effective due to: convenience, legality and $.
 Hence why I think I should use the sub first for the worst..taper down..til im consuming literal SLIVERS of suboxine..(musta been .2-.3 mg honestly PER DAY at most when i got to this point) usually at this point i wake up the day i have no more subs and just battle whatever uncomfortable life im living and im clean!  .. so... if i get to this point of no suboxine and still uncomfortable...should i take 20mg? 10?
 i understand all of our bodies are totally different.  . (example: why does pot help with my bipolar and anxiety but does the opposite to many a friend?) And finally.. regarding the lope and subs.. whats mixing them like? say i take 2 mgs of subs.. thats it im out... i start feeling wd symptoms like 5 hrs later.. can i take some lope?  how much? how much is too much?   alright..  you guys have slowly become a community i sort of rely on and totally respect. youre all (incredibly) intelligent and knowledgeable in all your own unique ways and i appreciate the hell out of you guys and galz :)  so thank you. nod on~ if that's your aim .  stay clean!!~if that's yours.   i hope the best to all of you and please help a fellow drug lover out :)  thank you . peace n love.

She was wearing a tight red dress and an expression on her face that captured some excellent emotion I couldn’t quite make out if only because it was unique to her. It couldn’t be original though because it was so familiar, this must be the rare intangible emotion which accompanies pure beauty. The hidden beauty all around us was reflecting off of her confident smile. She had long blonde hair and an ass to die for. Classic would have to be the word for this girl, or maybe just sexy as fuck. But I’m a hopeless romantic and a hopeless addict too. So of course being high tends to make things shimmer with beauty. Oh and I’m a blackout drunk to boot. So I thought maybe I’d win her over with some Bowie and signed up to sing before I got too obliterated and made an ass of myself.  ",1401295933.0

This shit has literally drained me dry money wise. My insurance helps a bit with my script, but hers doesnt at all.

its 130 dollars a week for her prescription with the 50 dollar coupon. which is only useable once. so 670 dollars a month for JUST her script. Seriously outrageous. Plus the cost of the appointments for both of us, the gas to get there. I got paid tuesday and its all gone because of this program. I bought 1 pack of smokes, and seriously the entirety of the rest of my check went towards our appointments this week, getting there, and our scripts. 

Her last script we had to fill in incriments because of the cost, and ended up being she missed 8 mgs throughout the week that she should have took because we cannot afford it. The doctor was furious about this. Scolded her about not taking her medication AS IT IS PRESCRIBED. Threatened to kick her out of the program for it. Like seriously what the fuck? We threw all our money at staying well on subs. We could have spent that money to get high, but instead we chose to stick to the program to the best of our ability, but simply could not afford to. It certainly would have been a hell of alot cheaper, AND more fun to get high instead. But we didnt... Its not like we're selling it or keeping it and she knows that (we have to bring in our empty wrappers).

It shouldnt be this god damn hard to get clean.

We asked the doctor to switch her to subutex and she wont. The only way she will is if we were willing to drive to the pharmacy every day, pick up 1 days worth, and drive to her office and take it infront of her. Kind of like a methadone clinic. This isnt feasable either...

She refuses to prescribe a dose to start weaning her off either. Her only choices are fill it, the subutex clinic option, or stop going.

So we're going to fill her last week script, use it to wean her off, and simply just drop out of the program. 

My question is, After we fill her last script, is there any way legally she can make us bring them back after we've paid for it and had it filled? I seriously wouldnt put it past her to try if she can. We're going to have to borrow money just to get it filled and I dont want to go have it filled with not my money, have the doctor realize she's dropping out, and have the cops show up to take the rest of her subs away.

I'm probably going to get hell from her the next appointment I go to after she finds out my fiance has dropped the program. Honestly wouldnt doubt it that she would kick me from the program as well. 

But seriously can she legally reclaim them in any way? Or are we completely paranoid and worrying about nothing?",1401426458.0

My questions are these:

a) For other reasons, I was given a legal script for a benzo. This will probably show up, right? Should I take in the rx bottle and explain to them it was a legal use? Am I still at risk of losing the opiate script because of it?

b) Weed. I'm not a weed smoker, but an old friend wants to get together and smoke up while he's in town. Since I'm not a traditional smoker, if I smoked after my test (and thus had a month before the next one) I should be fine, yea? 

c) MDMA. Similar situation as above. One time use, month or so before my scheduled test. Will it show? 

I'm not sure what specific test my clinic uses but it's the cup with the strips inside. It usually takes them about 15 minutes to get the results and release the opiate script to me.

With that said, can you imagine the cops who hate addicts and how they may use narcan to ""punish"" us? Right now I'm imagining the cop who shoots naloxone into every single person who is caught for possession of opiates. Hopefully it is only used for OD's but I can see god-complex police twisting the definition of ""overdose"" to include anything that even resembles an opiate high. Example : sleepy eyes, sedated, raspy slow speech, etc etc. I can hear it now...

I have talked to some amazing people here and love reading others experiences. As always, I am a wall of text.

I am a ball of nerves today, and I don't like this feeling. Ya know, I always get annoyed when people on my facebook news feed posts image after image of all these inspiring quotes because even though I have needed all the inspiration and encouragement these last few months, I am too cynical to like it rubbed in my face. But I saw one today that said, ""You can't be surprised that it rains when you create the storm"" and I realize how perfect that sums up most of my position in life right now.

As of today, I am 4 months clean. If you had asked me 4 months ago if I thought I could do it, the answer would have been without a doubt, no way. My family were being less than supportive of me cleaning myself up--Acting as if it should be a picnic and ridiculing me in my moments of weakness, which were many. But I stuck with it. I did it cold turkey. I did it with the help of my friends who I know now really really care for me. And I took for  granted all of that love when I was using. I am really a lucky girl, and I like to think it is because before I became addicted to heroin, I was an amazing friend to them. And they remember that.

Four months ago, I ripped off some family members to score for H for me and my bf. We were living with my parents at the time because we lost our apartment after squandering away rent money on getting our fix. Let me just say, I love my family. They have always been on my side, even though their form of love can be tough. And I live with regret every day for what I did to betray their love. I take responsibility for my actions, but I can say without a doubt, I would have never stolen off of them if I hadn't been pressured to do so by my boyfriend. I loved him more than anything, and did not even start using until getting with him, finding out about his habit, and letting the curiosity of it overcome me too. What started out as a fun, bonding experience between us, became a tireless search for getting well, hurt, resentment, and a major life avoidance all around. I have said this many times, but in a way, I was just as addicted to him as I was the drug. I often thought to myself, would you even do this shit anymore if you were with him? Are you just doing it because you know its what he loves and you'd do anything to make him happy?

Well, I think my parents felt the same way too. They knew I was a nearly perfect daughter before meeting him. I never gave them any trouble growing up. I had great friends they welcomed in as family, I never wanted for anything. I made perfect grades, went to college and graduated and immediately after obtained a job that put me on the fast track to succeeding in life. I was taking great care of myself, and then I met my boyfriend, found out about his addiction, tried to fix him, and only became involved after I felt defeated. IF you can't beat them, join them, right? And then I lost everything I worked so hard for. After finding out about me stealing from them, my parents did the only natural thing and kicked him out. I was to have no contact with him, no phone calls, no visits. We only occasionally could facebook. In which he promised every time we talked that he since he was kicked out and had to move an hour and a half away, he was focused on getting clean, getting a job, and coming to my rescue so we could be together again.

""I won't forget you"", he told me when he left me crying in my driveway with him the day he was leaving. ""I will work on myself, you focus on you, and we will be together again because I love you and this will only be temporary.""
I so wanted to believe that, so I did focus on myself. I repaired friendships I lost. I detoxed painfully, through Christmas, with one relapse in January. After the relapse I felt tremendous guilt and became dedicated in my thinking of how I really did want things more than I wanted to get high. It felt great not waking up to feeling sick anymore, and not feeling as if I had no control over my choices. My bf and I were still keeping in touch on facebook. His talk of promises and progress started happening less frequently. I knew he was using again, and before long, he dropped a bombshell that he had met a new girl at his new job and he wanted to see how things went with her. It crushed me, but not as much as it crushed me when I found out he managed to rip me off of some money soon after meeting the new chick--who also shared his habit. We exchanged awful words, and he blocked me from facebook. Thus, ending my contact with him.

And that was the best thing to happen for me. I finally started focusing on myself. No more relapses. No more cravings. I was having fun with my friends, meeting new guys but not bringing myself to be intimate or get too close. Just, finding reasons to feel good about myself.
Two days ago, my ex requested to add me on fb again. I debated saying no, but curiosity got the best of me, so I accepted. And it turns out, nothing has changed. I got a little bit of joy telling him that I have been 4 months clean, and hearing him say ""it looks like people were right all along when they said they believed you could kick the habit as long as we weren't together"".

But it also really depressed me. He's doing bad, as a mutual friend of ours relayed. That he has started dabbling with meth in addition to H, ripping his friends off any chance he gets, and pawning his parents's shit. The new job and new girl? Lost those too. Of course, he isn't aware I know those things about him, other than the job loss and the new girl loss.

He seemed proud to hear I've been sticking with sobriety, but then the conversations started. I have no idea why I asked him what kind of shit he has been getting lately, because, I know better. He told me he has been getting half Gs as cheap as $50 (where I am living now, dope is so hard to come by, it is $50 for just a tenth! Which has REALLY helped my sobriety) And now the seeds are being planted. We've been talking about old times, fun times, a lot of times spent in an opiate fog. Regrets, and hard times too. The town he moved back to is the town were living together when we were deep into our habit. He's clued me in on who is still in the game, who has the best shit, and all the drama thats surrounded it all. And god, its so stupid, but I find myself missing it all. The first time in months. Fucking missing all this bullshit.

And of course, what else do you think has been suggested? He wants to get together, maybe let me try a little of the stuff he can get, hang out. He's sure to follow this all up with, but if you really want to stay away from it, I understand. I would just like to see you.

And its all manipulation. I know this. I know that if he thinks he can get me with him, and alone, he can talk me into anything. He is a person I can never say no to. In fact, during one of our biggest blowups during our relationship he said to me ""Inlovewithboy"", I don't want to take advantage of you. But you never tell me no. And I am an addict, so I will take advantage of that. Why can't you tell me no?"" I could only answer that it was because I loved him too much.

Today, I am clouded with terrible thoughts. The cravings are so bad, my hands have been shaking. I have made myself feel physically ill, just wanting to get high so bad. I keep coming up with get a way plans, just to get to him, so we can score, do our shit, and feel content in bliss together. My urges to get high have been pretty much non existent , but when I couple that with the possibility that I would be getting to spend time with him, it seems like the only thing on earth I want more than anything. It is scary to know I would risk 4 months of the hardest time of my life getting clean, just to spend time with my boy and his ""boy"". I am doubting my strength. And disgusted by my weakness. But none of these feelings are stronger than my want to just be by his side again.
He's using me in this situation, I know. He's burned every bridge he has had at this point, and coming back to the one he always knew would let him cross. This has nothing to do with me, and more about what he can gain. And I still find myself thinking, fuck it, you love him more than anything.
I need words of encouragement. I'm worried for myself. I am worried about this double addiction I have and the influence I will let him have on my life. I don't want to disappoint my family, my friends, and most of all myself. The smartest thing to do would block him again. Having the last 3 months with no communication with him has been some of the most peaceful months I have had in a long time. But they have also been heartbreaking.
Trust me when I say, I don't want the rain. I've been helping to create this storm the last few days, and I need to strength to bring out the sunshine again.
