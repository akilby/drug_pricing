My ex is addicted to opiates I never judged him (I'm not an user) we ended things because of his strange behavior towards me.

We remained as friends but the thing is we were getting along good but this week his family left for vacation and he was at home sick and couldn't made it to the trip, I decided to keep him a bit distracted ( he is suicidal) so somehow yesterday he started to insult me and tbh he is that way so I let it pass.

Today he started with the same even told me I looked like a man, and all my things and life were a crap and I didn't deserve to live and he wishes he could step in my throat until I'm spitting blood and I asked him in a very polite way to stop because I wasn't texting him to get insults and he said he was taking the piss off me he wasn't mean it.

We changed topic and we started to talk about his city of born and he suddenly said I was creppy and he needed privacity about it and he will just block me, he ended saying good bye and didn't actually block me.

Also mention he never wanted me to take or share a pic of him or anything even when we were together",1552526814.0

Recently I’ve had more access to them and I didn’t notice that I started to use monthly and now weekly. The last couple of weeks have been 2x per week. I don’t consider myself having an issue (yet), although it is eye opening to see how it is slowly creeping up on me without me knowing until now.

So I was thinking about the Kratom associated deaths where it appears that most the FDA is just pulling out their asses with Kratom being responsible for a death when it's a car accident or an OD with Kratom when heroin and some Benzos is present as well. Many say there is no way to get respiratory depression from it. So is Kratom e.g. with Benzos or with ketamine a somewhat safe combo?

I just took about 240mg codeine because being the dickhead I am I took all of my buprenorphine early, leaving myself with 48hours before my weekly pickup.

So I take the codeine and about 30/40 minutes later it starts. Itching. Fucking everywhere. And not just a little bit, it's like my skin is on fire and crawling with scabies or itching powder something. It was awful. I had to get naked and rub myself with the hard side of a couple of kitchen sponges. Luckily I had some anti-histamines and quetiapine (an anti-psychotic but works like an anti-histamine up to a certain dose).

Anyone else experience anything this dramatic on codeine? I've used it a few times before and I remember the itching was pretty bad but this was insane. Sounds dramatic but I was genuinely worried I'd have to go to A&E just incase I went into anaphylactic shock or something, or at least to get help with the unbearable itching. My veins were popping out and everything. Morphine and heroin make me a bit itchy, sure, but it's almost like I can ignore it without too much discomfort, though scratching feels good, but this was insane. I literally couldn't stop scratching, I was out of breath and my arms were shaking just from exerting myself.

Luckily it's dying down now, though the quetiapine usually knocks me out so I'll probably pass out in a bit. Honestly worth it, I might miss what mild high I'll get but god damn that was awful.",1552495654.0

What I said would only be a one time thing has turned into a thing every time I get take homes. The clinic I to to refused to increase my dose when I told them I had withdrawal symptoms, so in my head I was just trying to get well and they forced my hand. Whether that is true is debatable, but there is even more to the story, including a nurse who no longer works there and her going against what the doctor ordered. Regardless, they would not allow me to go above 60mgs when I had an habit of 2 grams a day IV BTH.

  


Anyways, in the name of harm reduction, it is not safe to IV anything that is not made specifically for being IV'd. Now, I believe this is relatively safe with one brand of Methadone. VistaPharm's liquid oral Methadone solution 10mg per 1ml. All the ingredients in this solution can actually be found in other IV solutions of medications.

  


Now, using a regular syringe is out or the question due to how much liquid you are dealing with here. Most Walgreens carry the needle you need. The largest that they ALWAYS have in stock are 3cc 23g syringes. Draw up the liquid and bang that shot. There is no burning, and you get a rush that I honestly feel is just as good as a Black Tar rush. Normal daily oral doses of methadone won't give you any sort of feeling other than normal if you are on a stable dose. Before I did this I still felt sick every day. But this gives a warm high that really is a nice opiate buzz. I even find myself nodding

Has anyone else done liquid methadone via IV? Btw, I am unsure what is in other brands of liquid methadone, unless it is made by VistaPharm, do NOT attempt. Also, do not try this with methadone pills or wafers, its nearly impossible and unless you have a wheel filter, you shouldn't be IVing pills.

b0m0ph,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/b0m0ph/early_days/,15,https://redd.it/b0m0ph,realcat67,Early days,"  

I don’t do it much, but from time to time I think about how I got into all this. I was raised in the deep south and everything you have ever heard about rednecks, rebel yells, pickup trucks, guns and mamma tried is absolutely true, pc considerations be damned.

After I was introduced to the needle, I wisely decided I needed to make getting high a priority in my life. My friend Robert took me down to what passed for a hood in our neck of the woods. It was really just a little dirt road with a bunch of shacks running down for a couple of miles. 

After that first time, I decided I could handle it and there was no need to bother Robert. I remember going down to Barry’s house and knocking on the door. At least, I thought it was Barry’s house but it was really hard to tell because people were coming and going all the time and plus there was always a ton of kids that no one would tell you who they really belonged to.

So when somebody opened the door, I just said, Barry. And in a few, he would come out of some forbidden territory in the back. I would tell him what I wanted and he would tell me to wait. 

Then I would say, ok, I don’t mind standing out here in the rain that much, even if it is really muddy. But could you please hurry? Because I have to be at work in 15.

To which Barry would retort that this ain’t no goddam popeyes, bro and it takes as long as it takes cause dude be baggin up and shit. 

At that point in life, I had no idea what he was talking about, but I didn’t have much choice.

Ok, well, I’ll be right here.

I was super naive in those days and would stand there like an idiot, cold, miserable, waiting. Sometimes Barry would come back and sometimes he wouldn’t.

On those days that he did not return, I would knock on the door again and, eventually, someone would answer. 

I could never think of anything to say, other than to ask if Barry was there. I was inevitably told that he would be back in five minutes and I should wait. 

In the rain.

Eventually I would give up and trudge back to my car. Those were the early days.",1552483705.0

I got there and one of my friends gives me a 10mg Oxy. I think “fuck it, what’s the worst that could happen”. We smoked, I felt great. We went to a horse stable and had fun walking around town.

Later we stop at a store plaza to smoke again and my buddy again, gives me another pill, this time H, and I take it, and smoked again. Went into one of the pharmacies and bought food and drinks.

About an hour later, I’m sitting on the floor of some building that is closed, drooling, eyes wide, but I’m passed out. I literally feel like I’m dying. I felt like my life force was draining away out of my body. Idk that’s the only way I can describe what I felt that night.

I’m like this for 10minutes and then I sat up and started vomiting my brains out. My “friends” ran out of the building, leaving me there. Afterwards, I collapse face down in my own puke and start choking on it. 

About 30 seconds later some guy walks in and helps me up and asks if I need anything. I just ask him to drive me home(I didn’t have a car at the time) and this is some random guy that I didn’t know, potentially dangerous situation, right?

Anyways, this guy drops me off at my house, no bullshit, no nothing. I walk in the house, I’m snapping my fingers quickly and my brother calls my name from upstairs. I walk up and he just sighs and tells me to clean myself up and go to sleep

The next day I got suspended from school for stealing money for LSD. 

A few days after Christmas I tried buying Oxy again bc I felt an odd urge. The dealer drove away with my $40.

I’ve been inconsistently sober for these 3 months, and I’m doing alright. Could be better, but alright.",1552444664.0

(Btw my username used to be u/synthetic-happiness but now I can’t find the password or recovery info. I was fairly active on this subreddit.) 

I was taken by complete surprise - I was actually being pulled over going 48 
in a 40. (Kinda ridiculous, I was driving my Dads Tesla while he’s out of town and it showed I was going 42MPH at the time “apparently” radar’d me.) 

My guys wrap their dope multiple times, using trash bags, layering and layering them, so if you do swallow them, you don’t immediately have any concern. (Even though I was losing my shit.) 

Anyway, Cop does standard BS (I don’t even think or care about the ticket) so I start Google’ing while she runs my license - ‘how to throw up drugs.’ Nothing. ‘How to throw up bad things’ and that helped so much. 

It told me to drink a lot of soda and or salt water.  Tons of it. I had to drink two 16oz monsters, 7 12oz sodas, and then another 3 12oz sodas until I threw up - on top of all of that, my idiot brother told me to drink olive oil, which I had about 3/4th bottle of. I also had two cups of salt water. 

So I get home, with a ticket, and run upstairs to my bathroom to try and start throwing up. Fucking nothing. I hadn’t eaten for the day, so even when I pressed on my uvula a lot, I only got small amounts of stomach acid. 

That’s when the soda got involved. 

After 3/4th bottle olive oil, 2 12 oz cups of salt water, 2 16oz redbullls, and 7 12oz sodas, I throw up the first bag, a gram of coke. 

This gave me hope, and also helped me realize that I have more time. (The last bag was black tar). I didn’t stop though. 

I drank three more sodas immediately, and the black tar bag was 3.5g, and wrapped 11 times (it was huge) I knew it would be a challenge, and for a second, I thought about going to the emergency room. So I start looking up emergency rooms near me, find one, and immediately I have to throw up. 

This time I decided to put my finger into my esophagus, this helped a little bit, and lo & behold, a giant black plastic bag of dope comes to my esophagus - I was choking at this point, and my significantly smaller girlfriend gave me the Heimlich maneuver - POP - it came right out, onto our brand new carpet. 

I realized that if I would have held them in my sock... even my fucking pocket, I would have walked away with a ticket, but not a lethal dose of heroin in my body. 

Our guys just usually want to see that we have put it in our mouth before leaving the car for their safety. I have always gone with the flow and figured I could easily throw it up if I had to... how wrong I was. 

I feel like we think that it’s not going to be that hard, but to put it in perspective - my blood vessels by my eyes, and inside of my eyes burst while I was doing this. 

It was fucking terrifying and in the future I’m going to be extremely careful. I live in a very well-off city/gated community. 
My girlfriend thinks that the whole reason I got a ticket was because I was driving my Dads brand new Tesla is a less... affluent part of town. It doesn’t matter why, I’m not in jail or dead. 
That’s all I’m grateful for - well and the fact that I threw up my drugs successfully and didn’t have to have my girlfriend go pickup again while I go to the hospital to get them out. ",1552439383.0

So, my only new year's resolution was to find a connect in my city. A couple of weeks ago I hung around outside the needle exchange and asked a guy coming out to help me score.

So I don't use needles and never plan to in the near future or use for that matter, but once a week I buy syringes for a very low income community that doesn't have access to get them.

So I go up to the counter and ask for what I need (I was very specific about the gauge, cc, ect) , the technician immediately gets defiant and runs to the pharmacist on duty. She comes back with what I asked for and clearly she looks unhappy. Precedes to check my ID for 25 seconds (Lmao) then buy them and go on my way. 

As I'm leaving the store I forgot to pick up a loaf of bread for my house. So I picked that up and proceed to checkout in the front of the store.

Well who do you know who's right behind me while I'm checking out? The same pharmacy technician! She then had the fucking nerve to ask if I have a receipt in the bag (the same bag she gave me!) and ask for me to take it out so she can check the contents of my bag. So it's clear that she thinks I'm stealing! (at this point I started to laugh out loud sarcastically)

So of course after everything checks out, I walk out the store and this Tech looks all pissed and staring at me like I'm passing the president or something.. Game. Set. And match for DaAppleJacks! 

What a bitch. I can't stand people who profile.

She takes the first dose when she gets up and the second dose around late afternoon/early evening. Each night when we go to bed, she ""sleep sits"" throughout the entire night. She'll start out lying down but when she falls asleep she ends up sitting upright in the bed and pretty much stays like that the whole night. Occasionally I'll wake her up and get her to lay back down but it's honestly pointless because she just ends up upright again. Opiates have always affected my sleep too but not like that. 

So I figured I'd make a post just to see if anyone else experiences this and if so, have you found any method to get some better rest? If she were comfortable I'd say fuck it, but she wakes up in a lot of pain from being slumped over and her feet and ankles also get swollen from having them dangling off the bed.

I think it was because I started to freak out because I knew I just took something that was not oxy.

The press is pretty decent (some could definitely pass as legit) but some of the pills are more obvious than others.

I had a short stint and am trying to detox. I have comfort meds sucks as kratom, my prescription for gabipentin and klonopin plus several hundred other klonopin and other benzos I have stock piled which I was just gonna try to detox using those, and am having a tough time. Someone suggested tapering off of it by using less and less heroin each day but I didn’t think that was really possible. Heroin has such a short half life and if you just use less and then less you just get sick. That’s the purpose of suboxone and methadone since they have longer half lives. I was just wondering if anyone has ever done that. 
To me that’s almost harder than trying to taper off xanax with xanax. It has such a short half life and no matter if you do to a detox or ask your Dr to taper you off of it 90% of the time they will switch you to a long acting benzo like klonopin or Valium since the half life is longer and if your on a high dose of xanax it’s hard to try to taper off of it with it itself because it wears off so quickly 
I have never heard of anyone tapering off of heroin with heroin
I have heard of a few people tapering off xanax with xanax but had a hell of a time and was usually on a low dose. Drugs like that with short half lives seem hard to taper off with the drug itself. But when I was on xanax at 6mg a day and tried to taper off it seemed impossible so I got switched to klonopin
Anytime I was very bad on heroin to the point of being really strung out I’ve always done methadone or suboxone 
But has anyone ever tapered off of heroin with heroin. I had a short run and am gonna detox and was just gonna use my variety of other non opiate meds to do it but someone suggested to just use less and less each day, this person was not very experienced in heroin and did it a hear or two a few years ago and is doing it on and off now and I don’t think is very knowledgeable about half lives and things like that so he’s not a very experienced person but It still makes me wonder which I don’t think would work cause eventually you’d just get sick and it seems like it would drag it out more

So here is a list of different trials I have conducted.

-I’ve tried just popping them and that was just shit. 

- next I tried licking off the coating, let them dry, and then crushed them with a pill crusher. The problem is it stays like a waxy flat pill, so I needed to take a knife cut it up into a powder. After that I tried boofing it and it was very underwhelming compared to just eating the powder coincidentally. I tried boofing/plugging  multiple times because it seems to be the best method of delivery aside from IV.  I tried letting the powder mixed in water sit in my oral syringe over night thinking it would get around any other ER that wasn’t defeated and yet again didn’t match up to just eating the chopped up powder.

- My most recent attempt has been my most successful thus far. I did the procedure listed above but instead of mixing the powder with water I mixed it with a small amount of the Bang energy drink. I mixed the solution couple times throughout the night and then went to bed. Woke up this morning and drank the solution and noticed a VERY FAST onset. It took no more than 5 minutes to feel affects and was quite enjoyable.

- Now I’m very interested in trying this same process but in my booty hole. I don’t think putting bang in my butt should be much of a concern. What do you guys think? Any concerns, comments or questions are welcomed! Sorry if this was hard to read lol I’ve been nodding.

So about 4 or 5 years ago I started with codeine and then hydros upon finally settling at oxy as my permanent opiate lol. I started with 15mg, But over the past couple years, I've been steady at 20mg to fuck me up pretty good.

Last week I made enough money to buy a few grams of the put of this world dope. I only do like .3 of really good dope a day. So when this shit ran out and only made a few small wales while having it...I ran dry. 

This was about 40 hours ago since my last dose. Not gonna write this up for the 100th time, so ill just let you know I felt like hell. Today, less then an hour ago I finally did a small middle man. Just got home 20 mins ago or so and did my normal sized shot. And oh fucking man, normally a ahot this size just gives me a nice lil high but this time I felt like I might fucking drop. Literally only 40 hours since last dose and it seems 3x as strong.

Tldr. If your not getting very much out of your dope or oxy amount you normally do then take a couple day T break. Just a few days works wonders.

Also, if you so only 2 says like me, your tolerance will come right back in few days. So either lowering your dose after the T break, or take a couple week break to really destroy your tolerance.",1552336311.0

Help me figure this out please?","THIS IS AN EDIT ADDITION: THE SHOT IN QUESTION WAS ALSO NOT FILTERED, I AM JUST REMEMBERING THIS AND ITS CAUSED ME TO WORRY A GREAT DEAL MORE. MY DOPE NEVER NEEDS A FILTER TO SUCK UP, BUT I STILL ALMOST ALWAYS USE ONE. THIS JUST HAPPENED TO BE ONE OF THOSE TIMES I DIDN'T HAVE ANY IN REACH, WAS SLEEPY, AND SUCKED UP THE SHOT WITHOUT USING ANY SORT OF FILTRATION METHOD. I AM HOPING THAT THE 3 SECONDS OF TIME I SAVED BY NOT WALKING AND GRABBING A Q TIP IS NOT THE ENTIRE REASON I AM IN THIS PREDICAMENT. ONCE AGAIN; I AM DUMB WHEN PERTAINING TO THE LEVEL OF CAUTION EXERCISED WHEN THE ONLY THING AT RISK IS MY OWN PERSONAL WELL BEING, WHICH IS A DIFFERENT ISSUE IN ITSELF.

&#x200B;

Ok, to start off I am very dumb and tend to think I'm relatively invincible. I am a fairly regular IV drug user so you can imagine how well those two things go together. I purely need advice on how I should best handle, control and fix this situation, or really to know if this is even a situation at all to begin with.

&#x200B;

So sometime last night in the wee hours of the morning, I was fixing to do a shot, and was struggling to register. I had sleepy eyes, was still high from before, and things were just not going well. My shot got to the point it was more blood than precious nectar, and the only way I could tell if I was registered was if the empty space created by the vacuum filled up with more blood. I thought I had registered, and I pushed what had become a nasty little concoction of blood and once nice and clean heroin nectar. I was met with little to no resistance, and did not feel any sort of burning sensation at the time of administration.

&#x200B;

This is where things go wrong. I don't get a rush like usual, meaning fuck, I've most likely missed. Whatever itll seep in slower and maybe keep me asleep longer. Well after a short amount of time my arm just feels overall bad, not normal but not like painful yet. Hard to describe. Went to sleep and woke up maybe 4 hours later. Now, about 12 hours from the time of the fateful shot, and about 8 hours since I woke up, I am experiencing a great deal of pain in the arm, it seems to specifically be in the upper portion of my arm. Above the elbow, and in the bicep area. Pain is increased with touch, if i squeeze the area. Increase in pain with movement of arm, straightening at the elbow, rotating the arm in the way that if held straight out with palm facing down, counter-clockwise rotation would make the palm face up. This last rotation movement just described seems to be the most painful one.

&#x200B;

I do think the level of pain, frequency and intensity of pain does seem to be worsening as the day goes on. When waking up it was simply a nuisance, it is becoming somewhat debilitating. Please help me figure out exactly what is going on here. There is NO visible mark, redness, swelling, anything. Absolutely NO VISIBLE aspect in anyway shape or form. The most painful area of the arm if on the inside, the palm side, right above the inside of the elbow, almost right at the start of the bicep, where it looks like the bicep would connect and begin. I will include a picture if requested, but there really doesn't seem to be anything that I'm able to notice that is out of the ordinary from a visual standpoint.

&#x200B;

Any and all help, suggestions, and even scolding will be read and appreciated. It is really starting to bother me, hence why I'm making this post. I would say the pain level is at the point where it is right in between causing enough concern to make an extremely detailed post asking for any kind of help, rather desperately, and then actually going to the ER. So it hurts pretty bad and if it continues to worsen and hurt much more I think the ER will be needed. Hopefully that can provide a decent explanation of how intense the pain being experienced is. Also, I would describe the pain as a somewhat sharp and acute aching sensation. It is not burning, and not exactly stabbing. But more of a sharp ache.

&#x200B;

Even wild guesses are appreciated and reviewed at this point. Please provide me with the level of risk I may be at, in terms of losing my limb or something wild, and just overall health in general. No numbness, pretty much full motion despite the increase in the sharp aching pain in the rather acute location previously described.",1552336198.0

Can somebody have a high tolerance to a substance without having used it prioir?

For clarification, i use opiates recreationally, maybe a weekend binge every other month or so, nothing too major. Although i have found that any type of Hydrocodone will get me feeling pretty good at the 15/20mg point (w/ zero tolerance) but Oxycodone takes 30/40mg to get me feeling the same as 15/20mg of Hydro. Additionally i have tried Codien pills and liquid (lean) and it has had zero effect at all on me. Please note also that i am not a very big guy. (about 5’10, 130lb)

One time he shot a dose, sort of fell out, and when I shook him to come to, he looked at me all wide-eyed saying he couldn't hear anything and that his ears were ringing.

Now today he says he did his normal shot, got a great rush, then after that his ears rang for a minute or so. 

What could be the cause of this tinnitus? I have never experienced it, and use the same dope, shooting it as well. There is no cocaine involved, this I know because I use the same dope, so that certainly isn't the answer. 

Does this sound familiar to anyone? My best guess is some weird reaction to a cut. The first time it happened  to him I thought it must have been some neurovascular thing from falling out and maybe O2 deprivation... but him saying he experienced it a separate time after the rush and not falling out makes me wonder what the fuck is going on.

The strips are 100% IVable, in fact I imagine they are safer to IV because there is thousands of times less fillers and insoluble garbage with the strips.

As the title says, I'm 18, and lately I've developed somewhat of an Oxycontin habit. I am extremely concerned of the ramifications of this, and although I've only been using for about a week, I feel as if I can already not control this. I also understand that this is nothing in comparison to the addiction that others have sustained, but I still am worried about going down this path. 

&#x200B;

My mother is prescribed and has  been for the past few years, so it is relatively easy for me to get pills, which doesn't help this problem at all.

&#x200B;

I want to stop. It feels like I can't. I wish I had never tried these pills. 

&#x200B;

Please, any advice on how to stop abusing these pills would be greatly appreciated. I am extremely worried about my life spiraling out of my control, and don't want this to go any further.",1552272753.0

If I couldn’t get clean, I had to make some kind of move. To me, it felt like being locked down on a life sentence with no hope of parole. If something did not change, there really was no point in sticking around.

I think people are reborn multiple times in life. First you go from 16 to twenty, when you become a for real adult and are amazed that everyone now thinks you should be responsible.

Then there is 22 to 35, when you are getting that nagging feeling that you should be doing doing doing something with your life. You should be having kids and getting a house. Actual stuff adults do.

Then there are forties, and you realize you are starting to get old. That is not acceptable so it is time to buy that Porsche and prove you could still fight in the ufc. Which you cannot. The future is now, old man.

Anyway, I missed a lot of these life changes because, I wanted my dope. Imo when you are on dope, you are sort of in stasis and don’t change that much, except to get desperate.

Unless you are just fucking crazy, you start to realize you are locked into a relationship that you cannot escape from. You are going to get fucked and you are not gonna enjoy it.

Maybe for years.

That was the hard part for me. One strange part of my experience was that, at the end, I had a lot of spare money and could buy as much dope as I wanted. So in a way, that was even worse, because I really could not even look forward to my little copping chills and thrills. I already  had my h. Quite a bit of it.

So now, I keep doing my h and I do not enjoy it at all. I am already as numb as possible and more does not mean better. I try to quit, fail, repeat. Everybody hates me. Don’t call me, I’ll call you, next year, maybe.

Every single thing that makes life cool is long gone. Friends, music, girls, drama (except for junkie drama, doesn’t qualify) family, adrenaline rushes, all gone.

I mean, if I got my shit together, maybe I could have bought a Harley or something, but I wouldn’t have enjoyed it. I didn’t enjoy anything.

Thus, better off dead.

I decided I had to try quitting again. But this time, it was different because I had no reservations about going back. It took me a few months to really start feeling good and to start dealing with life.

I try hard. I pick up that guitar. I smile at that girl. I do that training. I do anything other than get bored, because a bored me is a dangerous me. I even do things with my in-laws sometimes, which is above and beyond. But no price is too high to pay. I'm sayin, consider the alternative. Fuck that noise.",1552272750.0

I need URGENT HELP from users from everywhere but from DEUTSCHLAND in particular. (HILFE FUR MEINE FRAU BITTER!),"Hello dear people. Here is the situation: my girlfriend is German so i live here at the moment. I speak very little Deutsch. My girlfriend's mother is an hardcore junkie for like 12 years or more. I'm not sure. Well, we just found out that she decided to switch from Heroin to Subutex because maybe it's cheaper or something, and she buys it on the streets.

We dont know if she know's any trusted dealer or if she buys it randomly. She just ran away today from the ""Junkie Help Center"" or something and doesn't want any Methadone anymore because she says that it doesn't give her the nod she wants. So, my question is: is there any (legal) way to buy an opiates test kit in Germany? Does Germany have some kind of ""free heroin program""? 

I also need to ask you professional junkies/dealers if the Subutex is cutted with Fent around here. I asked all this to my girlfriend first but she is crying for 3 hours now and she doesnt even reply to me. I don't know what to do. I'm not an H user and neither is my girl. She is also dealing with addiction but it's from other drugs. I struggle with alcoholism so i don't know anything about H or opiates in general.

She is afraid that her mother will die soon.

Thank you very much and safe nods! :)

I have probiotics that come in a similar sized capsule with powder inside them - so I was thinking of grinding up the beads inside the hydro, putting the powder back inside the capsule and then putting them in with my probiotics so they'll blend in. I think it'll pass just fine.

What I'm more so worried about is if I'm going to get stopped for bringing a couple rigs on the plane, not to mention a cooker or would a spoon be less inconspicuous? Or should I suck it up and just snort them instead? No, I'm not sticking them up my ass but thanks for being about to suggest it.

Those of you who don't think you deserve love - YOU DO!  Those of you who think you are worthless - TO SOMEONE YOU ARE WORTH EVERYTHING!  

I posted this in r/heroin and was asked to crosspost to here.  Crossposting doesn't seem to be allowed - so here it is as a new post.

Long post: An honest account of what it's really like to love a heroin addict.

As a nurse I have had the honor of working with some of the most caring, empathetic amazing nurses, and yet, I still hear things that break my heart. ""Junkie"" ""Loser"" ""Scum bag"" ""just OD and get it over with"" ""Asshole""....foul, horrible things that in no way reflect the person they are talking about, but instead reflect the way society sees an addict. Sure there are addicts that are ""losers"" or ""assholes"" but there are also doctors, teachers, athletes and countless others who are ""losers"" and ""assholes"". Being an addict makes you an addict; being an ""asshole"" makes you an ""asshole"". The two are in no way related.

I have met my fair share of addicts who fall into the category of ""asshole"", but in my career I have met far more who were sweet and kind and funny. And I fell in love with one of them.

I knew who and what Michael was from day one. He was funny, bright, silly, beautiful, and ridiculous at times and he was a heroin addict. And he was the bravest risk I have ever taken, and one I have never regretted.

Michael was sober when he moved in with me. He was excited about his sobriety and about being a part of a family. In fact, he used the word ""family"" so frequently it was like he was afraid it would one day disappear and he had to use it as much as possible before it was gone. It was his favorite word.

Michael and I had a deal - nothing about his addiction could be a secret. It was probably the most honest part of our relationship. He hid nothing from me. Not the times he wanted to use but didn't, and not the times he wanted to use and did. There was not an aspect of his addiction he hid from me. He shared it all; things I won't share here. And here is what I know...

Michael loved heroin. His exact words were ""I fucking love heroin"". He loved the way it made him feel (or not feel). He loved the escape it afforded him. It was his way of coping with not only the horrors of Afghanistan that haunted him, it was his way of coping with a lot of other personal issues that were just too hard for him to face any other way.

Michael loved heroin but he hated what it cost him. He hated that he hurt the people he loved with his addiction. He hated not being a part of his son's life. He hated the disappointment he knew he caused. He hated that it made him a hypocrite telling Sam that he would kill him if he ever found out he touched a drug, and then getting high behind a closed door. He hated himself for being ""weak"", for needing heroin to face life. He hated the lies it made him tell....the sneaking and secrets he kept from everyone but me. He hated what I saw, the things I learned because of him. He was ashamed of his addiction; he loved the drug but hated the man it made him.

There is a panic in loving an addict. Sometimes it's a quiet panic and other times it's as loud as a freight train. It's constant worry. Would today be a good day? Would it be a bad one? Michael used for all sorts of reason. A bad day at work. A fight with his father. A reward for being ""good"" for several days in a row. There was never any rhyme or reason behind it. There were bad days were I was sure he would come to me and tell me he wanted to get high but he didn't. And there were great days where I was shocked when he told me he wanted to use. I could never be sure what would trigger it.

So what's it like to love an addict? It's terror. It's keeping Narcan in your house and in your car. It's seeing the man you love turn greyish blue from lack of oxygen and breathing for him to keep the oxygen flowing. It's being afraid all the time. It's worrying every time you are apart that you'll never see him alive again. It's knowing that you can try and get them help; that you can plead and beg and bargain, but that you cannot make an addict get sober. Ultimatums do not work because unless an addict is ready to get sober they will chose the drug over the person giving them the ultimatum. It’s not being able to tell anyone, because telling won’t make them sober, but it could make them leave and then who would keep them safe? It’s being able to separate the man from his addiction in your head and in your heart, because he is so much more than just an addict. It's choosing between loving the whole man, addiction and all, sober and high, or walking away. It’s knowing, deep in your soul, that every day is a blessing, because with an addict the next day is not for sure. It’s also knowing that no matter how many days sober they have, that no matter how hard they try, that no matter how much you love them, that losing them to an overdose is almost a guarantee.

I love Michael. I love him for who he was in the most honest way possible. I knew all of the good and bad parts of him and it changed nothing. To me, he wasn’t an addict. He was just Michael. He wasn’t a “junkie” or a “loser” or an “asshole”. He was one of the best people I have ever had the honor to know and I miss him every single day. But even in my heartache – even with the immense pain his death as caused – even with the constant ache of missing him – I wouldn’t trade one single minute, good and bad, I shared with him.

If you have gotten this far - If you have read all the way to the end - I hope the next time you talk about an addict that you choose your words carefully. That you remember to separate the person (who could be an asshole) from their addiction. I hope you remember that that person you are calling a ""junkie"" is someone's son or daughter, that they are the love of someone's life, that they are somone's friend or brother or sister. I hope you look a little deeper and see the person for who they really are - and not just for the one thing that absolutely does not define them. Because I can honestly tell you that if I were to make a list of who Michael was, heroin addict would be far far down the list.",1552259804.0

It's like 50 feet long and the width of my leg with terrifying pincers. I somehow had just enough time to grab its pincers and pull them apart as hard as I could which ripped the fuckers head in half. I then threw it on a fire and went back to digging in my arms for a vein. Then I pulled it out of the fire and started pulling the meat off and eating it. It was like lobster and I remember it being delicious. So then I was eating delicious centipede meat and trying to hit when I said fuck theres not even any coke in this shot so I started wondering theough medieval England searching for cocaine for my shot and eating giant centipede wishing I had some garlic butter for it and more fucking giant centipedes attacked and I woke up.

How? Why? What? All these questions race through my mind. I know how to fix this though, meticulously I crush the pill, add water, and pull it up. I have to take my shoelace out to tie off, as my normal tie isn't in my pocket. Shaking I guide the needle into left AC. 


“Just like the first time” I think to myself as blood fills the chamber and I press the plunger. Before leaving the bathroom I lick the spoon swallowing the cotton. 


Oxy isn't as quick as H to hit you even when you shoot it, but it still hits like freight train of bliss. 


I walk into the kitchen to wash off the spoon. The spoon clattering in the sink sounds like a slap.


“Why does my face feel funny?”



Instantly it was back on the ground next to a puddle of puke. I heard my mother crying as my father slapped me awake, dragging me to the shower. The door is busted in, the floor was littered with a spoon, 5 empty stamps, a spoon, and a needle. 


“Call 911!” my dad bellows, drenching me in ice cold water. 


“I... I'm sorry” I stammer and slur out the words.

I was in the washroom at the mall today and the security guard rushed in asking if anyone had Narcan (naloxone), thankfully I did have some narcan nasal spray on me, a woman who looked to be in her 30's overdosed. So security takes me to the women's washroom, just seeing her looking lifeless and dead is still vivid in my mind, her eyes half closed, rolled to the back of her head, laying there motionless, pale and blue. I was only in the situation for a minute and the paramedics came and they told me to leave, so I'm not entirely sure if she even made it, she very well could of died. This shines a light on my own use, I've been addicted to opiates for about 4-6 months, with a month and a half break somewhere in between, the possibility of OD is very high for anyone. I plan to get clean this week, tomorrow, I have some meds to get me through. Thanks for reading and stay safe.  ",1552208389.0

azd63o,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/azd63o/vicarious_consumption/,1,https://redd.it/azd63o,SpokenMemeArtist,Vicarious consumption,"So, I’ve been browsing this subreddit for the past week. I like to see the pictures of hauls I guess. I know these drugs exist, and there’s not a week that goes by where I don’t think about them at least once. I’ve never had an under-the-table opiate habit or a scrip for some lasting more than a few days.

I guess I’m more of a special case. For a full decade of my life, I would have episodes of extreme pain from a chronic issue I had, which is sometimes compared to the pain of giving birth. I’d believe it. So I was given opiates; dilaudid, Demerol,morphine, while hospitalized. This would occur for 5 day segments once every few months, for 10 full years. Always through an IV. 

Whenever I’m in pain now, physical or emotional. My mind wanders back to those experiences, the numbing, the euphoria, the shield between me and my troubles, the rush as your entire body tenses up before giving way to the most relaxing sensation in the world. 

I was prescribed a few narcos for (unrelated) pain recently, and they reminded me of how good it can feel.

I guess my point is, even when you do everything right and make no effort to introduce it into your life, even when your dealer wears a lab coat,  this shit sinks its claws in you. Even years later you still feel it’s tug

I don’t think I’ll ever start a habit, maybe this sub’s feeding into it, or maybe reading the negative stories keeps me away. I know this probably isn’t news to anyone here, but it’s scary that this part of me exists, and I guess I wanted to get it out in a non-judgemental space.",1552200653.0

And I feel like that that's just part of life when you live in a capitalistic Society which right now I feel like it's as good as it gets of course that's not to say it can't be improved and that it isn't being improved but I really feel like it's as good as it gets. But that's something that we has Americans don't think about has a whole too much is that in this country we inherently have the right to be informed. Now I I don't think that necessarily mean you will be informed. I feel like we have to do the leg work. Since the Advent of the internet there's been a lot harder war of information you have to siphon through disinformation and misinformation to find it.  basically,  if you want to be informed of a subject a lot of people are talking about it today. I also feel like that as Americans we have the right to choose which is something that other people in countries don't necessarily get to the scope that we do.  I just feel like that's the duality of a Democratic Society the fact that you are going to have things products push up on you because it's a capitalistic Society but that if you want to find out the truth about something, whether you need it or not, would it be good for you.  you have the right to be informed and make that choice. There is a war to control the information you get and the decisions you make on a daily basis but I feel like thank God I live in America which at its core,  although it may not seem like it sometimes, encourages get yourself informed and make a decision based on the information that you receive. Something else I feel as Americans is it's our duty to be informed and it's our duty to make the best decision for ourselves, that's how a democracy evolves,  because the man ain't going to do it for us. I know the man sounds cliche but mankind has been fighting the man since the dawn of time. I think that's something that all human beings have in common is being under the thumb of the man , whether we realize it or not. It's like the powers-that-be fight to get you to give up the right of being informed and making decisions but if you focus your willpower into learning what's right and wrong for you in life and making the decision that's best for the life you want to live you can get it in this country.  it's not easy and the man ain't going to make it any easier but it can be done. I was watching the podcast that was talking about censorship of the internet and how the internet is inherently metastasizing against censorship and that when the government finds one way to censor the internet will always find a way around it.  I believe that too and I believe with every bout of censorship that we have more people will want the right to be informed, and to make better decisions for themselves, because it's easy to tell a liar after you've been around one long enough,  and with the access of information speeding up so much with the Advent of technology and the internet the rate at which people learn to be informed and make decisions for themselves is increasing exponentially.  I do believe technology is a dual sided sword it can be really really powerful sometimes.",1552195160.0

I’m no model, but I’d say I’m a conventionally attractive female— I look like I’ve never touched a drug. 
So when I started smoking crysTal at 21, nobody knew. I was the only girl in my friend circle— the rest were these flamboyant gay guys and one of them introduced me to T.

I always hated the effects of H, but when my friends gave me some, I fell in love this time. I’m a good massage therapist, but I was even better at junkie. 
My life turned upside down after about a year on H. I was spending so much fuckin money. My rough calculation for one year is $20k-30k and that’s probably low balling it...
In the 24 hours before I got help, I’d used $600 worth of quality china white. I did the 30 day rehab and then the NA shit.

i always thought of drugs like methadone and buprenorphine as 'worse than heroin' since they last longer and you hear all these horror stories about how its just trading addiction

i went to a clinic a few months ago and got prescribed buprenorphine (just had to sign up, my script costs like 8 pounds a month), i dont need to use heroin at all since it masks the withdrawals-- nor do i have any real urge to use. i take 4mg a day (compared to smoking up to a gram a day just to feel normal) and im not kidding myself that im 'sober'-- im on an opiod and realize that. Only now i can live a normal life, im no longer spending my youth laying in bed unconscious or withdrawing... i barely managed to stay afloat in university while using, but i should now be on track for a high (enough) grade overall. I also workout again, and have gained back alot of my muscle (i was a bodybuilder before i was a junkie-- the bupe also does enough to mask my back pain that was usually my excuse to relapse)

before going to the clinic i had tryed to wean myself off heroin a few times using buprenorphine, tapered over a week or so-- the withdrawals were much more bearable. though id just end up relapsing like aways... so here i am xD

I hear a lotta people talk about how after getting addicted to opiates you stop liking weed, which is true for me too. But why is this? For me it’s because ever since opiate addiction started for me weed makes me overthink so much. It’s also the fact that I’m a drug addict that makes my high a lot less enjoyable because I find myself overthinking it and getting lost in my thoughts about the fact that I’m a  heroin addict. And this whole thing just makes me very anxious and sad. Weed also makes me see the bad side of everything.

So did you stop liking weed (if you did beforehand) after getting addicted to opiates? If so what is different about weed now that makes you not like it?

My friend explained that these dreams are interpreted as using the opiates because your brain is kickstarting the receptors and repairing them- thus anything released by those receptors that the opiates once mimicked and burned out, are manifesting themselves in dreams of using as they serve similar functions.  

At face value, I thought this was intriguing and maybe possible.  Is there any truth to my friend’s claims?  I’m still a little skeptical...but even if this becomes an exercise in placebo, I suppose it could be beneficial as when a dependent has a dream, they could interpret it as healing rather than a calling to relapse that they should give into. 

TL;DR a friend says opiate using dreams after quitting are the brain healing and producing the chemicals that opiates initially replaced. The dreams are a sign of healing. True?",1552161346.0

I hope what is by and large a very mild romance with oxy may serve as a cautionary story to anyone who, like me until yesterday, thought doing oxy was no big deal. Bits of my story might sound familiar as I did post here sometimes when I was convincing myself that what I was doing was okay. 

“I always said I’d never touch opiates. I’ve had family friends, friends parents, etc die from them over the years. I never understood the appeal of nodding out, or how someone could trick themselves into thinking they wouldn’t get addicted. 

Then about two weeks ago, I ran out of weed. Yes, running out of weed mentally gave me the go ahead to start taking oxy. Because I didn’t take it as seriously as I should have and now I’m paying for it. What’s the big deal, I told myself. How much can a tiny little pill change your life? Obviously everyone else was making out to be a much bigger deal than it was. Luckily for me though, I don’t have a dealer, and my supply is limited and I don’t have regular access. 

What started as 7.5mg of oxy the first time I tried it has turned into 25-35mg within under two weeks trying to chase that high. According to everyone those are low doses, but I am already feeling the damage I’ve done to myself, mostly psychologically as far as I can tell. Terrified I’m going to go to sleep one night and never wake up, leading me to deprive myself of sleep. 

Yesterday I successfully took only 15mg of oxy. I have a feeling I know what most people might say about tapering, but I think it’s the best way to ease myself out while I’m not in too deep. Today I’m only taking 10mg. I don’t even want to. I don’t even want to be high. Honestly, it wasn’t even ever a fun high to me, it wasn’t ever really enjoyable it was just... nothingness. 

I’m sick of scheduling my day or lack thereof at this point around a fucking pill I don’t even enjoy at this point. No one knows I’ve been taking it, no one knows anything about my habit. I can’t believe I did this to myself, especially the profound ignorance in the reason I started and the lies I told myself. Not even two weeks and I might have just lost a really good job opportunity because I can’t function right now. 

I can’t even differentiate between what’s potentially real withdrawal and what’s my mind making it up. I swear so much in my sleep last night, keep having hot flashes, I just feel like shit. I’m more sad now than going through anything physical. 

I just want out. “

Everyone can downvote all they want, I expect that. I wrote that when I was so panicked and hysterical I could barely breathe— I know my withdrawal is psychological, not physical. My point of this post is to show anyone thinking of trying it how bad you can fuck yourself up psychologically in a short span on time on a low dose of oxy. The absolute hysteria I have catapulted myself into at my own volition. And this isn’t even the tip of the iceberg. I can’t even see the tip from where I am. This is only the beginning if I kept going. ",1552158882.0

Alright, so I go into this rehab place about 2 days after this guy came in. There's 3 characters in this story. Me, D (the heroin fella and roommate), and M (my other roommate.

We were in rooms with 4 beds each, all of them occupied at the time including me.

I was the youngest person there, really still a kid at the time, everyone else was 22-48 so it was difficult to talk to people. D talked to me like he was already my friend, he seemed nice. But everything got weird quickly. I saw D and a some other guy (from another room) going out the emergency exit door a few times, and one of these times D grabs something from M's drawer when he wasn't there. I don't care at first. Maybe M doesn't mind D going in his drawers? D kept saying things along the lines of ""you don't wanna get stuck up in this room, you should try to go make some friends"". Seemed nice, but I'm sure he just wanted me to leave so he could do something.

Alright, so let's get to the good shit. One night he was clipping his toenails way past lights-out time. It took him about 20 minutes to finish. I'm not sure if he was high as fuck or what. Another night I wake up to piss and he's in the dark just hunched over the desk snorting lines of.... Something? He doesn't realize I'm up until I'm right next to him and he freaks the fuck out. But I just walk right past him and go piss and come back to sleep. 

Well a few days pass and he fails a drug test so he's kicked out. M has been a great friend of mine for the past couple of days, and it seems now like he's talking trash about D, so he must not like him. So I ask M ""did you let D go in your drawers? cause D did that a while ago"". The answer was something along the lines of ""oh shit, no I don't, why?""

We tell the administrators and they go search the room. They find a turkey baster attached to a horse syringe needle and it was filled with dope and blood. Seriously it was huge. It probably would've held an ounce of liquid or more.

We're not sure if they had some sort of massive tolerance or if their plan was to just cook up once and shoot up just a little bit at a time while hiding the half-full needle in M's drawers. It made sense to me cause cooking up every day is risky. (ideas on exactly what they were doing would be appreciated) So not only did they do this, but they stole the horse syringe, a spoon, a turkey baster, a lighter from the shop house, and probably some other stuff just to do it.
 

And of course, to top it all off, they both got Hepatitis from the needle. 


tl;dr 

roommate hid heroin in another roommate's drawers without consent. he built a rig out of a massive turkey baster and a needle from a horse syringe (or maybe the whole thing was just a horse syringe, idk). I scared the shit out of him while he was sniffing lines at midnight.


Edit: looks like it was probably just a simple horse syringe. either the first or second largest in this picture are both accurate representations of what I saw, except they had a needle on it. https://ii.bigdweb.com/fcgi-bin/iipsrv.fcgi?FIF=/images/bigdweb/source/130-9.tif&wid=400=&cvt=jpeg",1552153090.0

I've been battling this thing for 5ish years now and it's been a rocky road to say the least. I got out of my umpteenth rehab October of 2018 and have been able to function since then. Going on a couple runs for a week or so here and there and then more recently chipping over the weekends.

I have found it so hard to stay away from opiates because of sheer boredom. I'm in a relatively new town and dont know many people outside of AA (and I'm not a huge fan of those people for other reasons). I can come how from work or school and find it really daunting to pass the time until the next day. I just smoke hella weed and take etiz.

Anyway, as usual my middle hit me up asking if I want my normal weekend routine and i had to say no. I'm visiting home next week and dont want anything to jeporadize that. I made this thread in hopes someone else decides to break the routine a bit.

My mum got fired a while back for taking prescription painkillers for pain in her shoulder and being visibly affected by them on the job, IDK how they noticed that she'd taken them, she just said that they found out about it and had to let her go. She got them from a friend, they were not on her prescription.

&#x200B;

This was like a year ago.

&#x200B;

I've noticed that she sometimes acts weird, a bit like a different person at times. I thought that she might be bipolar type 2 and that what I saw was hypomania. Lately I've started to suspect that she's taken something when she acts like this. Her pupils aren't very big so I rule out amphetamine. She has wounds here and there from itching and she's been complaining about pain in her back and shoulder for a while (she's just very sickly in general, her body is not doing too well). 

&#x200B;

I'm suspecting that she's gotten opiates from her ""friend"" again. 

&#x200B;

What do you guys think?

The weird way she's acting in is like this:

Goes on for 1-4 days

She CONSTANTLY makes sounds, like humming on sounds, snorting sound (outwards, not inwards like snoring)

seems a bit disoriented and confused but certain that nothing is wrong when I confront her

Always seems to be ""on a mission"", like she's gonna do something, but she doesn't have to do something she just acts as if she has stuff to do, like walking around, picking stuff up and moving them etc.

&#x200B;

Idk it's hard to describe her way of acting.. But yeah I'd appreciate any help I can get.",1552143238.0

One I remember is when my mom first saw needle marks on my arm. She grabbed my wrist , looked, and started crying. 

That blew me away, because never had I ever seen my mother cry.

I remember thinking, if I wasn’t a junkie before, I sure am now.

Things didn't go well after that. I became a little heroin punk, hanging out in clubs and pretending I was a real adult, which I definitely was not. 

Later, when I was older, I no longer had time for that. Because I had to hustle up the money to go cop and I had to get there before the police changed shift at 7:30 am. That was always fun, because I would get up sick and if it took me even 30 minutes longer than planned, things were going to get really real. 

I wish I could have quit because my family wanted me to.

I wish I could have quit for my friends. These were guys I absolutely loved and they were not gonna tolerate me shooting dope. We had a long tradition of hanging out, doing whatever drugs we could get our hands on (but not heroin) getting stupid drunk and dancing like idiots and just generally be young guys. So I lost them a long time ago.

Then there was the subject of relationships. I was interested in a disinterested sort of way. I would meet someone from time to time, and we might chat and there might be a spark or two, but in the end, it just was not worth it. Sort of like if I was a paraplegic and other people were running marathons. Why get involved? For what reason? It was not gonna end well.

I wasted so much time with dope. There is no other word for it. 

I really thought I needed heroin and that it was the only thing for me. I wanted it worse than I ever wanted anything else, and I did extraordinary things to get it. 

The thing was, it was all bullshit. Somehow, the dope wormed its way into my head and convinced me that I could only be happy when I was doing a shot. And that was kind of true, for maybe a year. It was not so much that I was happy as it was that I was feeling no pain.

It literally muted life for me. It flipped that switch to the OFF position. And the longer I did dope, the longer life needed to be muted. I so looked forward to getting that fire shot. Then I would do it, and I would be feelin it, but it just was not right. My problems were not going away anymore. 

And if you can’t trust your dope to make your problems go away, who can you trust?

Sadly, I am the only one who can make my problems go away. And the only way to do that was to get clean. Damn. Who saw that coming?

One day, enough was enough and I was stopping right the fuck now. No more bullshit excuses. Yes, it is going to hurt. You can do it.

It did hurt. Really bad. And what I realized was that I was never going to be strong enough to handle opiates. They were always going to win and the only way to not lose was to not fight.

I might be wrong, but I don't think I'll ever use again. ",1552133492.0

Ban me or whatever you want but from my personal perspective almost every death I've experienced in my life was opiate related. Not cancer, drinking and driving, smoking, coke, old age, Whatever. Fucking opiates. ",1552106214.0

So when we do drugs like opiates it sends a flood of dopamine in our brains, right? So when the drugs are done, and we go thru withdrawals, it's because of the lack of enough dopamine and/or serotonin, correct? 

So the depression, anxiety etc. Is due to low serotonin from our body's not being able to make enough of its own because it's used to the opiates creating it 

So let's say if every time we did drugs and it flooded our brains with dopamine. After the high is all said and done and our brains werent so depleted of its own serotonin, would be still go thru withdrawals or get addicted? 

TL;DR: our brains creates its own dopamine, if our brains didn't get so deleted of dopamine from constant usage of opiates, would be still go thru withdrawals or get addicted? ",1552102246.0

However, on top of that, he's taking 1mg of alprazolam to help him sleep. This is somewhat an old habit of his, maybe for the last \~1 and a half years.

Is he in danger? Will these medications interact?

I just discovered TODAY that his taking both, and this (tramadol whole day + alprazolam to sleep) has been going for like 2 weeks. Until now he's ok, some difficult to breathe, but that may be the tumor.

Also, what could substitute the alprazolam? We live in Brazil and it's really easy to get access to controlled drugs (e.g. he bought the alprazolam just going to the pharmacy lol).",1552099416.0

im turning 40 next month and want to be done with this endless ratrace and makin my dealer rich ....but the mental addiction and temptation is waaaay to much and i find myself on autopilot to go and cop....i chip so i cop maybe twice a week...spending about 400+ on dope every month...using half to a gram on each run...snorting

ive never had physical withdrawals but my anxiety get fucked when i dont have dope...im irritable and hate life and find no pleasure in doing things while not on dope.

I cant get it off my mind...and i really need to let this shit go...im tired of hiding it from my wife and my daughter is almost 6 months old...my goal is to be done by april 1st..

am i a complete shitbag if i dip into the saving and cop?  i want to delete my plugs number but i cant imagine life without my fix...its like the one thing i really enjoy...

dont get me wrong...i love my family...and i know what im doing is wrong...i dont have anyone i can talk to about this  and i feel like im going to fuck up and end up copping...

i last copped on saturday..$50....then another $40 last night....and now im thinking of coppin another 100 worth with money im not supposed to spend...i

im just ranting butni guess this is a cry for help or support or just approval to go ahead and fuck up as long asbi have a plan to really quit..(ive reset my NOMO countless times)

all i keep thinking is ""its just another 100 bucks....we'll put it back""....my mind is repeating that scene from Requiem where they keep dippin into the shoebox....

fuck...i feel like im already going to fuck up and give on...shit im even tempted to leave work early today to cop...my saturdays are shitty if i wake up without dope...im bouncing off walls and frantic from the moment i wake up...

ive got one more month....and then this has to fuckin stop...im tired of this merrygoround and want off....but having access to this cash is fuckin me up...

to cop or not to cop....that is the question...

fuuuuuuck i cant turn off the voices in my head

i guess im just lookin for some kind of support here ..sorry if this is a bitchy shit post.....ill be sitting here checkin my phone for orange envelopes like im waitong for the dopeman to hit me back and say its all good...

any words would help right now....thanks for reading..

temptation is a bitch on her period....

TL;DR I was about to die to my addiction, did a 180, got clean and I'm happier than ever.

Anyway, 4 months ago I had a meta realization that my life was falling completely apart and that I was fooling myself into thinking it was fine. I was stealing money, selling whatever I could, doing whatever I could, to get my shit. I was doing 13-15 30mg oxys a day. I was destroying my nasal passages and my life/relationships.
Suicide crossed my mind almost daily. I was so miserable and was barely existing let alone living. The entirety of my days consisted of trying to find money or pull some scheme to get well. I put on a good act though, as none of my friends or family knew. Finally one day I reached my limit. I was sick for almost 3 days, had no money.  Hadn't eaten in a few days. Hadn't showered, hadn't slept. 
I just stayed locked in my room crying and sweating and sick. My body actually felt like it was shutting down, I could feel the life being stripped from my soul, literally. I sat with a loaded gun in my hands just looking at it and thumbing around with it deciding what to do. I felt like such a coward in that moment. Not because I hadn't pulled the trigger yet, but because I didnt want to exist anymore. 
While I was contemplating how to do it, my mother called me, (i told her i had been feeling under the weather) 
She told me my aunt called her and told her 
""Tell ____ everything is okay, I'm not sure why but I have this feeling that he needs to know everything is going to be fine and that hes not alone. Tell him I love him and that whatever hes going through, he can do it""
I started crying even heavier and begged my mother to come over without really telling her why. When she got to my place i explained everything. Literally everything. She was mad/upset/every other emotion imaginable, but she said we could take care of it together. And that I didnt have to do any of it alone. She called so many places for me looking for somewhere to take me. And found an outpatient place that could see me the next day. I went and started subs that day. 
It's been 4 months on subs and I haven't looked back once. Haven't had a single relapse or even a thought to do so. You couldnt pay me to go back to that. 
I have a job, I have friends I see daily, I actually laugh and genuinely smile. Im starting to remember all the positives that life has to offer. Having come through all of this has forced a new perspective on life Into me. I now realize how precious life is, and how important interaction/relationships can be.
My dr holds classes/meetings for patients/addicts/families of addicts/ and anyone that wants to show up. I recently started leading some of them and it feels amazing. I'm going on a podcast next week to tell a more detailed version of this and more details about before I was clean and the entire process. 

I never thought I'd be clean. I figured I would die with a crushed Roxy in my nose. I used to read this sub and all the posts of people saying ""if I can get clean anyone can"" and scoff at them. But I understand now. And it is actually true, any of us can get clean. Not everyone wants to, and that's fine. But if you want to, you absolutely can. If you made it this far, thankyou for reading all of this. I missed you guys and it's nice to be back. Love you all <3

Now I need a game plan.,"I have destroyed my marriage and my wife. She never deserved this. I feel lower then low right now. I have never been this low in my life.

What I thought would never happen to me has finally happened. I overdosed. What started out as a Kratom habit finally lead up to a near fatal overdose in just one year after being clean for 5. I suspected something was wrong with the dope because it was so white. I actually thought it was fake. Guess I was wrong. My wife literally saved my life by calling 911.

I just finally got out of the hospital and here’s where I’m at: My wife is most likely going to divorce me. I don’t blame her with the constant lies and sneaking behind her back. This was her last straw. She has always been up front about drugs since the start. I have not. If we stay together I will just keep doing more damage to her. I know I’m going to receive something negative feedback for hurting and scaring such an innocent person multiple times. I take full responsibility for my actions.

I was also thinking I should literally check myself into an outpatient program ASAP like, later today when they open. How do you guys feel about that? Any past experiences?

While being escorted out of my apartment. I remember what seemed like 50 people scattered around outside my building as well as  multiple fire trucks, ambulances and cop cars. Mostly cops, medical personal and a few of my neighbors so I’m definitely at risk of being evicted. I learned that apartment complexes can request information regarding tenants being carried away in an ambulance. Any comments?

I was also curious. At the hospital, after the Drs and other paramedics were done doing their thing. A woman came in with a computer, asked me a bunch of questions and the. asked me to sign something. I guess it was a consent form? Well, since I had no idea what I was signing I refused. I asked her for a print out. She said “sure no problem, let me get that for you, one second” and then she disappeared and was never seen again. Maybe she forgot? Does anyone know what or who that signature was for exactly?

So I call my guy who currently lives out of country but has guys in the US who run his business. I asked for 100 bag of brown and 50 bag of white. The driver gets here and only gave me white but I thought it was the dope so I was fine with getting no coke. But I open it and turns out he only gave me white. Now I’m sick af and the last thing I want is coke, I need dope, so I text my guy immediately and ask him to send him back but he said I had to go meet him.

So he sends me address and I go there. I sit there waiting on a side street in the ghetto next town over from me. I ask him again where to go and he sends me an address right down the street so I go there. This Spanish kid comes up to my car and I ask who he’s waiting for. He said “(blank)” and I said oh me too! Can I wait with you? (Afraid that I wasn’t gonna be able to meet the driver again but I thought oh well they’re coming to this guy next so I’ll definitely be able to meet them now)

I soon realize he speaks zero fucking English and he calls my guy out of country (who speaks English but not perfectly) and he tells me I need to give him more money if I want the brown. I tell him I’ll give the white back if he can give me the brown but we weren’t understanding eachother for some reason. Eventually I just say “hey can I just pay you the rest tomorrow” and he says ok that’s fine. 

But I keep asking him when the driver is coming and tell him I’m with the dude the drivers going to next. The kid finally hands me the bag of dope after all of us going back and forth for like 10 minutes.  (I didn’t realize he was trying to hand me something this whole time but I couldn’t understand him) and I finally realize that this was the dude I was supposed to meet to get the brown! But I thought I was meeting the  driver who came to me before.

This whole time we both keep calling the guy and he keeps trying to tell me that the dope is IN THIS KIDS HAND! I was like OHHHHHHH okay...so since the time I met the kid to the time I left, it took at least 30 minutes of him sitting in my car and us both calling my guy back and forth and me trying to communicate with this Spanish kid who speaks no English at all. I was so relieved when he handed me that bag but I felt so stupid for this process taking so long. But after he hands me the bag he kept asking me for the money and I kept trying to explain that I already paid. So he calls the guys AGAIN and I talk to him and tell him to tell this kid the deal with me already paying and paying the rest tomorrow, so basically the translate for me. So finally he does and I’m all set. I wish he told me that the kid walking was the dude who had my dope. I thought he was just another person buying off of them waiting for the driver but turns out he’s one of his dealers lol I just wish he spoke a word of fucking English it would’ve been so much easier.

Sorry if I didn’t explain this good, it was a very complicated situation, but I was sick as fuck which made it 10 times worse. Got my dope tho so I’m cool with it all lol


Side note: I thought the kid came up to my window because he thought I was the driver. Turns out the whole time he was just trying to sell me the fucking bag lol ",1552042956.0

In the last week, my life has been turned upside down. Here’s a little background for context. I am 28 years old, and have been in and out of sobriety since I was 17. I went to a 90 day treatment in January of 2018. I stayed sober for a little over eight months, and in that time, I had so many awesome changes than ever before in my life. My girlfriend of nine years and I purchased a brand new home, I left an awesome career for an even better one, and my relationships with my family and friends were getting better than ever before. I relapsed on oxycodone that we’re literally sitting out on the bathroom sink at my girlfriend’s grandparents house. Since then, it’s been a constant struggle to stay sober. My girlfriend would find out, then I would get sober again for a month or so, and relapse again. 

For the last four months I’ve pretty much been using full time, but switched from pills to smoking heroin about a month ago. Even during this time I was keeping everything hidden very well, and things were looking up in my relationship and in my career. 

My girlfriend, we’ll call her “Claire”, is the absolute light of my life. I have basically grown up with her, and she is simply incredible. She does not use drugs at all, and rarely drinks. Her family had a lot of substance abuse problems, and it just turned her off of it. She has been with me through it all. She’s saved my life on multiple occasions during overdoses, and his been nothing but supportive and loyal even when I felt like I didn’t deserve it. When I went to treatment this last time, she was introduced to Al-anon, basically a 12 step program for the families of alcoholics and addicts. They really focus on stopping enabling behavior. I think it has really helped her not take my drug use personally, and there isn’t anything that she can do to keep me sober, I have to do the work. 

This past weekend I was sleeping in a little bit on Saturday morning, and she looked in my Jean pocket it’s from the night before and found my stash. I was being very careless because normally I would keep that hidden in my car. She woke me up crying and heartbroken and told me I had to leave. It broke my heart to see her so hurt. She told me she knows not to take it personally, but it just hurts because she thought I was finally sober. She also told me that her heart breaks for me and it hurts for her to watch me struggle with this. It was really emotional when I was packing up my things, getting ready to leave the beautiful home we had saved up for for years knowing we were done. Claires set very clear boundaries with me after the last relapse, and one of those were that we had to be done. She couldn’t handle going through this anymore. I completely understand, and she deserves so much better. 

After we set our goodbyes and I left the house, I went straight to my dealers house and actually injected heroin. I was so distraught and sad. This beautiful life that we have worked so hard for seemed to be crashing down. She let my sponsor and parents know that she found heroin on me, and all of them reached out to me to let me know they loved me, but I had to figure this out on my own this time. I have been staying in a hotel since then, crying myself to sleep every night. From the outside looking in, it seems so simple. Just don’t use drugs, in the whole world is yours. It’s just not that simple for some reason. This addiction has made me hate myself. Even though I am somewhat successful (not trying to be braggy), I feel that if I was not an addict, I could be so much further ahead in life. It seems like opiates have ruined relationships with people who love me and are loyal to me, but for some reason I am more loyal to the opiates than my loved ones. I am getting the keys to an apartment tomorrow, and I am in the process of moving some stuff around at work so I can take a week off at the end of this month to detox. What hurts is that even if I get sober again and stay sober, I don’t know that Claire and I will get back together. I think I have just hurt her too much at this point. She has been checking on me regularly, and has been nothing but loving and supportive. But she still is sticking to her boundaries of us not being together. 

I really want to get this monkey off my back, and not have it run my life like it has since I was 14 years old. This is all I know, and while I would like to believe that I am a pretty high functioning addict, this lifestyle is not sustainable for me. If you pray or meditate, please keep me in your thoughts and prayers. I will keep you all in mine. Again, I’m sorry for this long and rambling post, I just had to talk this out somewhere. I love you all, and I hope you all find true love and happiness in your lives.

All of my veins, at least any that are accessible to me on my hands, forearms, upper chest/shoulders have died off one by one. The ones I know still to be there are surrounded by enough scar tissue to bend a needle 90 degrees if i twist or move that area in the slightest...  

The last few days have been hellacious. I’m wondering if maybe it’s just time to switch to the longer needle, if that will even help...  the rigs I’ve been using forever(.5cc 31g 8mm) ...now that generally I have a fresh rig every time I fix... this somehow hasn’t helped near as much as it normally does when I get a fresh box. 

My arms are wrecked, you guys. Years and years of this I believe has sort of killed the nerve endings around where I hit so it seems like if and when I’m missing, pushing through or off by just a smidge, I don’t even feel it until its way too late.  

Getting anything to register properly has never been so difficult. It has been an extremely frustrating week. It’s bad enough that I’m planning a hiatus on subutex starting tomorrow. I figure taking a few days break for all the swelling to subside can’t hurt.

2 days after I ran out, I had to call my doctor and ask for some more because I was in so much pain.
I just got six more, and now 2 days later my pain has gone down, and I’m using the last of my Percocet, but what’s weird is when I take one, within the first 20 minutes, I begin to experience some visual effects similar to the very beginning of a come up on LSD.

Whether like above board or underground? There was a piece on NPR tonight about it and it lead me to do some reading. I saw that these types of guided trips have been used to treat alcoholism and to help people quit smoking in the past with a surprising rate of success. This got me wondering if it would have the same type of success for opiate addiction or if it would be less successful because of the theory some people have that ""a drink is a drug is a man"" or ""a drug is a drug no matter which one it may be"" or however it goes. I've never really been a believer in this theory considering that the 8 years clean time I had I was on bupe maintenance and I have always been able to drink in moderation, and  I have never had a problem turning down uppers or other drugs that I dont enjoy, leading me to believe that my poison is my poison, not all drugs are automatically the same. Does that even make sense? I have to wo dr why these trials were done on alcoholics and not drug addicts in the first place and if that is the reason or if there is another reason that I am overlooking. 
Also I am just curious if anybody has had experience with this in general and if it was successful. I am looking for a way out not just of addiction but in terms of depression as well and it seems like these kinds of treatments could have real potential to be successful where antidepressants fail.

Heroin

Because my little brother gave me half of his last hit I gave him my last sandwich.

Out of Nowhere my brother turned blue and started to shake violently.

First I realised he was choking and having a seizure.

I did my best and 5 minutes of heimlich maneuver to make him spit out that nasty bite.

He was still shaking mad so i gave him a heart massage and shouted his name. Without results.

His eyes looked horrifying, My Hands grabbed his underweight body and put him into a safe position so he cant choke on his vomit.

After 15 Minutes he started to react to my crying calls...finally...

He was still shaking and almost unconcious.. Trying my best to calm him down I gave him a Heart massage because his breathing was still slow.

Never been so scared..

Suddenly he came back and didnt realised what happened.

He could barely speak but was getting better.. 

Gave him water, some hugs and kisses and he was over the mountain...

Im so glad hes alive..

took half of his dope as an reward and smoked it..

Still processing what the fuck happened..

Is it because he was coming down of the coke into a massive heroin high? Was it because the Pregabalin? he smoked alot and doesnt have a opiate tolerance like I do...

I quit my job cause i used all the time there and was where i got my dope from (co worker). I got ready to cold turkey and get through the hell week that is withdrawal. The only meds i got to help out was some xanax and a few addys so i didnt totaly zonk out on the xans. At this point i was using anywhere from 1 to 2 1/2 buns a day so i was expecting pretty serious withdrawals since i had been sick before obviously i knew what i was about to endure. I dont remember the exact doses i was taking per day but i kept waiting for the withdrawals to hit me hard. After one week when i ran out of my meds i had experienced none of the symptons i was used to feeling other than being fatigued a lot. No muscle aches, no nausea, no diarrhea, no insomnia, no sweats or shaking, absolutely nothing. The weirdest shit ever but i just took it as some type of sign that it was time for me to quit and has helped me to stay strong and stay clean. Idk why this happened but i am grateful and just wanted to let you guys know that its possible to get through this you just have to want it and be done with the lifestyle of forever hustling to get high and avoid the sickness.

Key word is recommenced. She does not feel comfortable exceeding this amount she says and has to reduce my Percocet from 4 down to 3 a day. I also take 20mg of embeda (morphine ER with naltrexone) twice a day. Then she recommend that I go ahead and drop the Percocet all together and add morphine ir 15mg 3 times a day to take its place. She said this is called replacement therapy and helps with your tollorance levels and makes it more effective. I told her if she thinks it will help my pain then I was willing to try it. My question is that I am terrified that the 15mg ir morphine will not work as well as the 10mg Percocet. She said it would but she does not suffer from chronic back/leg pain from a gym injury. I had a ruptured disk at the L5-S1 level that smashed the nerve and I worked with it like this for a year as a server and kept working lifting weights. I could rep 405lbs deadlifting so I was really lifting ok. I’m strong, 33years old, and tough but this took me from aspiring bodybuilder to a weeping baby in a wheelchair because of the nerve damage. A microdiscectomy, PLIF L5-S1 fusion, 2nerve block injections, 10epidurL inkections, 12 triggerpoint injections, Countless hours of PT, and ongoing pshycological treatment later I’m now waiting on insurance approval for the Senza HF-10 spinal cord stimulator implant to try to help the pain since they absolutely will not increase my medication because I’m “to young”. All this coupled with the fact that she is cutting one dose a day off of my breakthrew medication either way. She gave me the choice and I said whatever she thinks is fine. I do not abuse my medication and actually end up with several extra pills each month. At one point I had an epidural that was so perfect it controlled my pain almost 100% and I VOLUNTEERALLY went off of the embeda 100% for 3 months. After the epidural wore off I had to go back on the embeda. They told me I was the first person in the history of the practice to volunteer to drop a narcotic medication lol. With this being said I am not worried about the euphoria or high or any of that crap when I ask this question. Is this change going to be terrible? Or could it help? Thoughts? Questions concerns?

I was planning on smoking or snorting about 5-10mg of oxy when I got home from work and taking .25mg of alprazolam about 2 ish hours after that to go to bed. Would that low of a dose be safe? I have a slight opiate tolerance that's rising and I used to eat 8-10mg of alp a day but it's been almost a year since that binge and about 2 months since I've taken any type of benzo.

aykzn3,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/aykzn3/is_this_normal_opiate_behavior_and_a_sub_related/,8,https://redd.it/aykzn3,TheoreticalCynicist,Is this normal opiate behavior? And a Sub related question.,"So... having used on off for the past few years, actively and majority of time last year, I’m trying to cut the habit out. However, I’m finding that I can kick the habit.. physically, fairly simply. As in, I can crank through the physical withdrawals pretty easily ESPECIALLY with less than 1 8mg sub.. I do a 1/3 strip, first day, 1/4 the next, and 1-2mg pieces for the next day (or two). Usually am fine, good to go! 

But this is my question... it seems to be the mental part, the temptation to want to just go get high after a week, 3 weeks, or close to a month being clean (when there is NO physical WD symptoms left), that I’m having the most difficult time refraining from. 

It’s as if, this moment comes along.. I’ll be working out, clean, feeling great for days/weeks, then this moment comes where I think about the possibility of getting high. I debate it, but it’s in that moment that I decide to do so or not to do so. If I decide against it, I won’t do it. But if temptation overrides, and I consciously decide to do it, I immediately start calculating how long the drive will be to score, how long it will be until taking first hit, etc. in that moment, if I decide to do it, my entire world shifts around the premise of “I am going to get loaded, and how can I weasel my way out of any obligations between now and getting high.” 

So, is the mental aspect of staying clean suppose to be the most difficult part? Or am I an anomaly? Because for the longest time, that exact routine is what “convinced” myself that I didn’t have a problem.. cause I could stop, and be okay, where others couldn’t even get past the physical aspect of WD. 

—

Next question is this:

I read everywhere that Sub withdrawals are far worse and longer lasting than opiate... if I were to take only 1-2mg daily for a week or two weeks straight, would I incur those same described Sub WD’s? Or is that in reference to someone trying to kick them that have been on them (and probably a higher daily dose) for years on end?

I guess, how long of use, and how high of dose of Sub is entering the realm of “bad sub WD’s?”

Cause honestly, the MINOR sub buzz I can achieve off even 1-2mg (when I have low opiate tolerance) is sometimes just as satisfactory as opiate high... 

Hear me out: it’s cause, I tend to use opiates for a purpose.. working out, studying longer/waking up earlier, socializing, etc. and the minor buzz achieved from small dose subs, gives me JUST enough of that careless/semi energetic feeling, to where I feel “great” not just good.. therefore, am stimulated in social situations, can lift longer in the gym, study with more ease..

Premise to this illustration is, if trying to use subs (in the meantime) instead of using dope, how long can this last at the minimal dose I described before I start trading minor buzz for 3 week long Sub WD?

Thanks guys!",1552011826.0

What's even more fucked is NONE of the stores in that area accept these cards for some reason. First I have ever heard of somewhere not accepting these.. guess they got frauded a bunch or something but idk how someone could do fraud with a prepaid fucking credit card/gift card. 

I sold a few of the other cards I had online and even got this square app so i can spend down all the cards i still have and get even if it's only a few bucks.

Today I found out where the open market in my city is. It's fucking 50 meter away from my workplace. I got halg a gram of heroin for 10€, (I very rarely use heroin but common 10€ wtf. The Qualität is about 10-15% raw I heard. But i guess that varies a lot. 

Well I mainly went there to have an oversight about the sketchyness and some benzos. And guess what. Super friendly old people, buying and consuming and just having a good time. About 5-10 regulars and the usual 2 minute buyers. 

Ended up scoring 20x 50mg for 25€ and 10x diazepam 10mg for 10€. All in blisterpacks fresh from the pharmacy. I even sold a 30mg Oxy for 10€ to a young couple and threw an extra 10mg diazepam. I love the prices here. I feel very lucky, and like i said. This place is 50m away from work but still very incognito.

I ended up gifting the heroin to a friend since looked like he was in withdrawl and could need it more than I do.

It’s amazing, sad, but amazing","Just a quick background. I’ve been a lurker forever but recently made an account and joined the community. Been active for a few weeks maybe. 

I just recently pissed away 7 years of 100% sobriety. Unfortunately, I had to have a couple dental operations done and with that I was subjected to a couple scripts of 7.5s. I genuinely tried to fight thru the pain, but when it became unbearable I broke. I filled them. I took them as prescribed. They ran out, and I was fine. But my brain was triggered. A month past, and a guy I work with was complaining how his doctor fucked his medicine up. So me being me, I ask a few questions. He explained he had been scripted 120/7.5 norco monthly, and his doctor just out of the blue changed his script to 120/2mg hydromorphone. He knew nothing of them. I obviously knew all about them. 

I end up getting a few and snorting them occasionally for a month. Then, as we all know “it gets worse never better” I run into my old “main plug” for the first time in almost 8 years, and get a rig off him. 

Here I am today, 2 months later, balls deep into an opiate addiction. My plug is completely dry for the very first time since I’ve been back out. I met him on his lunch break about an hour ago. He claims he’s hurting too, but then the unthinkable happens. He looks at me, and says damn bro I feel bad. I feel responsible for you getting here again(first wd in 7+years) and hands me a 30(press). Man the gratitude and immediate change to my health was unreal.

Anyways, Ive been down this road. And I’ve experienced the light at the end. Today was a realization that it’s time to change again. It’s always maybe tomorrow, and that’s what it will be with me too. I’ll probably go at it a week or so, and then probably a sub maintenance. After having real sobriety for extended length of time, I can truly say, that’s the best life. 

Hope everyone can become well today. I’m hoping he’s able to re up on something after he gets off work! If not it’s going to be long night and rough morning tomorrow!!

I suffer from frequent Kidney Stones and my Doc prescribed me Tramadol to cope with the severe pain they cause me when I pass them.

Good news is that Tramadol knocks the pain down from 10/10 to about a 3 or 4/10 which is an absolute God send.

Bad news is that I am having loads of side effects from the pills. Typically about an hour after taking 50mg - 100mg (dose depending on pain level) my stomach starts to gurgle really loud and I get this really weird feeling. It's hard to describe but the closest I can compare it to is the kind of stomach feeling you have after an adrenaline rush. This tends to stay with me the rest of the day and sometimes into the next morning. What usually accompanies this sensation is a slight dizziness and mild to moderate nausea. I often times also get indigestion and a bloated gassy feeling too which isn't painful but is distracting none the less.

Basically, I don't want to stop the meds because they work wonders for the pain, much better than the Codeine they had me on before, but I can't stand these side effects as they are starting to affect my work. Is there anything I can do to counter these side effects so that I only get the pain relief?

My excuse? More work but while I still heavily value sleep and so I prioritize getting a full night's sleep above most things. Beyond that, my workload has lessened and I've had a chance to approach my backlog of things to do. Such as the major water maintenance for my turtle tank yesterday, determining why I got zapped by a filter (I have a a new theory), and securing my tortoise habitat so he doesn't get hurt by jumping out. Eventually I'll make a hinged ramp so my tortoise buddy could come and go safely whenever he wants unless I decide to flip the ramp up. Like the door on a Castle moat. 


&nbsp;


Then there's the telescope thing... that's part of what inspired that last post. You see, I just for some reason imagined a few combinations of a scenario. What if I was still a heroin user? What if I was still falling for Cliff's shenanigans on a weekly basis, as opposed to quarterly. To be fair to myself and my intelligence, the last time I loaned him $40 I was not duped, I did t planning not to get it back but enough excuses here. The point is, even before I stopepd using heroin and oxy, I stopped doing business with Cliff and separated my entanglements with his business. When I realized Derrick had a big mouth and there was no way for me to keep using heroin without shannanigans from both of them, I decided it was a good at ime as any to stop.


Perhaps in other universes this panned out differently. Maybe I stop using dope but still hang out with Cliff every day. Maybe in another universe I don't even smoke weed, or maybe I invented a way to put tar into a wax pen and can be found alkl around town re-charging my vape pen at public places because I'm homeless and use the tar-vape-pen so much that I need to re-charge it fully three times a day. More if I don't get a complete charge!

Now that last one, that just came to mind but I think I want to visit that universe as well sometimes and give readers among the opi family a chance to read it.

A day in the life alternate universe Sloan, that's universe 2266557 in the sequential multiverse catalog. In many of the universes there is nobody sentient or more accurately... is our definition of sentient truly encompassing? Well, to put it more accurately, only a small amount of sequentially catalogued universes inhabitants know about the multiverses, fewer know it is actually possible to shift between them. Shift? Perhaps a shuffle is more apt, especially during any first jump. The first few ""travelers"" didn't come back, only through a process of trial and error did they stumble across a usable combination of materials and frequencies. Thanks to the neutron-doped transponder rods, it is possible to for a traveler to return to their universe of origin as long as they are one ""hop"" away. After a second hop it is only possible to go to the previous universe, provided that they calibrate their own sensory instruments to the tune of a unique transponder frequency before their last hop.

&nbsp;


In universe 226557, which we'll call *557 for short, Sloan is basically the same person he is except that he's still hanging out with Cliff. In fact, he bought his telescope to Cliff's house and Cliff spilled his Pepsi on the Schmidt corrector. As a result of the process of re-alignment, Sloan had to re-calibrate his shit. During the process he mentions to Cliff that he has an $1800 mount on back order, this in turn get's Cliff's mental cog-wheels working. He realizes, ""he has the money.... he has that money!!!! I could finagle something."" Sloan goes home that night and keeps his distance. 


&nbsp;

Four days later, Cliff calls then knocks on Sloan's door at 9:40am. Sloan was up since 4:00 AM dicking around with his telescope and didn't answer his phone when it rang. So Cliff explains, that the nursing home which his mother is staying in wants $750 or they will kick her out. Cliff assures Sloan that he can pay back the loan on the second day of the month when the SSI deposit clears. Being quite reluctant, Sloan wants to buy time to sleep on it but Cliff is kinda just countering everything that is said to that end. Sloan isn't getting more time to think this over and doesn't have it in him to just scream and exclaim his thoughts -- most notably, ""get the fuck out!""


&nbsp;


Sloan says, fuck it.... he said I'll get it back on SSI day. I'll just have to hover over him that day as well. 


What could go wrong?


Cliffs mom dies. [although this happened earlier in our universe] A week later Sloan goes to get his money but Cliff is nowhere to be found. The lights are all off and his doors are locked. Cliff's sister must be up to somethimg else or in collusion, for once. 



Eventually, Cliff explains, ""the SSI didn't clear.""


Then at another point the same weekend he explained, it cleared but I can't take it out on a Sunday because they don't process something on that day, per Cliff.



Then he explains on Monday, ""it cleared but I can't get access to it because my mom's debit card was cancelled and they won't let me touch the money yet.""



**Sloan shares his experience with the opi family on MySpace, in *557 MySpace bulletins are treated with the same respect and importance as Reddit. Reddit is a little experiment by this Emo kid from Brooklyn who went rogue and moved to a nice compound behind satellite internet. As it turns out, releases and updates have slowed down considerably since. Although Reddit slowed down a lot, it is a happier overall scenario than how it panned out in our universe.

Conversely over here, this kid committed suicide in universe numero uno. It was a really sad story, with a conspiratorial twist although mostly based on conjecture. What is known is that the young man was supposedly so depressed after making money that he hung himself. It doesn't add up, but I didn't even have a hint of what true depression was until I experienced opioid withdrawal. The term ""crushing depression"", feels just like that.... one can learn to out-grow it but sometimes it descends like a black canvas with random concrete blocks weighing it down as you walk around under it. I'd imagine that Aaron Russo could have been in such a psychologically claustrophobic state.

It's okay, I think... I get paid in a week and the money will replenish what I loaned. Well, two things... my hours were cut so my paycheck only clears $500 and I'm down $200 after loaning Cliff the $750

**Responses to MySpace Bulletin:**

running@ft3r_dOpaM3an : You fucking stupid ass. I love you but I told you to stop fucking with that nigga last year. I'd ban you if peopple didn't enjoy learning from your foul-ups.



enjoysvaginasandmedications : What she said. 



SINderella69 : But did he at least offer but sex again to compensate you for the wait?



&nbsp;


End of part one. 

Next time, did Sloan take it in the butt as compensation or will he now that he was reminded of that option?


Is he still going to hang out with Cliff just to be on his case every day about the money? Spoiler alert, yes. That's the point of universe *557. 


&nbsp;

Second spoiler: No, Sloan did not take it in the butt... he only did that one time because of a really awkward bait and switch. Cliff told me he'd get me a freaky goth girl on the condition that she could stick something in my butt. Little did I know it would be a blue-haired merman. Literally, a fish's head and body and legs like a man. Apparently, in Universe *557 they did a bit more in the way of genetic augmentation. There's a number of human-animal chimera. Hell, **Sloan hangs out with a sentient tortoise.** The dude still drinks beer but can only consume it from a funnel and Sloan is a good friend because he helps with that.

In the old days, this would be about the time my eyes would open, just long enough to slam my morning shot. Then, just because I could, I would have a shot of tequila or chug a beer.

I can’t say that was happiness, but it was close enough for me.

I mean, why do all that work to be ok with the world when I could accomplish the same thing in a quick, ten minute morning routine? I was all about that efficiency.

I would flop back down on my bed, sigh deeply, and return to sleepytown.

But now, because of my lifestyle choices, things are different. My organic alarm clock, realcat66, bitch slaps me into brutal awareness every morning. Her paws tap my cheek until I get the fuck up and feed her.

She loves me but has no mercy. It takes me about five minutes to ponder the futility of my existence, how cruel god is, and maybe getting clean wasn’t the best idea. Then I rise to my feet and do what has to be done.

So my dealer buys from a few different connects. Lately, I think he’s been going to this one guy a lot because his stuff always breaks down like this. 

Talking about black tar, obviously. 

And I know anybody who has done a lot of black tar has run across stuff like this before Bc I’ve had 3 main connects for BTH. And at one time or another, all 3 of them have had stuff like this before. So it obviously gets around. 

So this is how I would best describe it. Normal BTH dissolves in water fine. I would compare it to black coffee with nothing in it. The color is dark, black. It’s very, very liquidy. No thickness at all. 

The stuff I’m talking about I would compare it to coffee with cream/ half n half. It turns a light brown, tan color. And it thickens up just a little bit. I’ve had a batch that made it damn near impossible to suck any of it up into the syringe. This stuff goes into the syringe fine so I’m getting it all but it makes me wonder what I’m shooting into my vein. 

This stuff def isn’t the best but it’s not horrible. But I would obviously rather have stuff that comes out black and normal. Luckily, my drug dealer is cool af and he asks my opinion on the product so he knows who to re up with. So I can tell him to steer clear of it. 

So I’m assuming y’all have seen stuff like this before. Did y’all like it/dislike it? Any idea why it turns that tan color and thickens up? Any information, experiences welcome. Let me know about everything, please. 

Happy nodding!!!!!!! 🤤🤤🤤🤤

Well yesterday i took part of an 8mg sub strip and it didnt totally make me feel better so i ended up smoking(just one little hit) which ended up having little to no effect on me(cause the bupe was already onboard im guessing)... I took that one hit around 12pm yesterday and then ended up taking more of the sub strip around 10pm last night and throughout today....

  


My question is... Do you guys think me taking that one little ass hit reset me back to day 1 of my WD?

Will my withdrawal start to hit me tomorrow?

Or did i do some sort of a taper? Cause to be honest i feel completely fine and had i not taken that little ass hit i would already be through most of the worst of my withdrawal(considering it didnt reset me)...

  


Subs never really did too much for me but i feel perfectly fine considering all ive had in the last ~3 days has been that little ass hit and sub strips.

  


Im hoping i just bypassed the worst of it and flooding my receptors with subs, then. Just a very minimal amount of H(that ended up not doing anything) then subs again was just the right mixture...

As although if done properly/sterile injecting in your groin it's slightly more Risker than injecting any where else complications can include Deep vein thrombosis, blood clots , lung problems , infection , possible leg loss , operation to fix the vein if badly damaged after years of use . Main danger is hitting the artery and splitting the artery wall and bleeding to death internally as a thicker & longer needle is used as scar tissue builds up . Though if your just starting a 1ml should be used and will cause less damage if you accidently pierce the artery . You will experience extream pain if s single unit is pushed into you . Also do not inject cocaine/crack until you are confident you can hit the vein every time !! As the crack may numb the injection site and you inject the entire contents into the artery ! 

TLDR: Me rambling(high as fuck)  on about finding a bag earlier that I lost a few days ago full of valium and didn't know I had lost it . Plus me getting prescribed methadone on the 20th 

  So I scored this morning from a new guy that's basically just at the top of my street . Pretty convenient but the stuff was pretty average . I only do a bag a day and try to stick to this and manage it for the most part .

 I had my dinner but don't eat most of it as I felt a little rough but not full blown WD . So I phoned this guy but he wasn't in bit said he'd be only 20 minutes . So I waited a bit and continued watching The Umbrella Academy I quite enjoy it and my fav character just happens to be the junkie that uses drugs to numb/block out his abilities which is seeing dead people and just saw two seconds ago he can give the ghosts the ability to interact with the living world . 

Anyway I'm going off track about 40 minutes later I go to his place  and his friend is there that I've never met . This guy tells me he has just picked up some new stuff . So he makes me up my bag and the other guys and puts s bit in the foil for us all to try . Me and his mate basically smoke it all and I have to run it for him or my dealer as he's only been taking it for 3 weeks ! Makes me kinda feel bad helping him take it as I've been in this road and been down ALL it's dark roads . I try and tell him to get off this ride while he still can !! Turns out it's his girl friend who got him to try it as apparently they where arguing to much when they where smoking cannabis so some how thought taking heroin would help!!! PMSL they don't have any idea the Pandora's box they are currently opening !!

I Tell him about the insane amount of times I've been in jail (27) which includes alot of remands which they would crazily let me out after 3 weeks remand at one point I was out on 11 bails !!! When I finally did get the jail for TWAC Taking With Out Consent (mother car) the judge ask my lawyer . "" I'm not trying to say Mr ****** is a criminal master mind but how the hell! Is this man still at liberty !! "" To which the court room burst out laughing ! and I got remanded in the end up they completely fucked up my case as I had 12 seperate summery charges which each could have got me 12 months 8 months for pleading early . 

The ""problem"" was thete was just so much paper work the judge couldn't deal with it and he gave me 140 days !!!! PMSL and a 5 year driving ban ! Which I thought was a little excessive !! But I was basically doing cart wheels back down the stairs to the holding cells . My lawyer came straight down to the cells just as ecstatic and told me as long as I managed to get on the bus to the jail which wasn't my local jail but HMP  Barlinnie which is a violent Victorian shit hole but I didn't care !! Plus my co-pilot (cell mate) was fully committed which is a 140 day remand for serious crimes he chased two police officers around with a hand gun didn't tire it or anything but he said they absolutely shit themselves !! And tried to hide under the patrol car ! Lol He got a visit practically everyday from his cousin or GF and they brought up 1/3 bags every time ! A day didn't go by that full sentance we weren't high !! Plus when I got convicted they didn't move me which they should have as your not allowed remand and sentanced in the same cell but because of my short sentance they didn't bother 😁 

Anyway at court  I was one of the last ones up so in about 30/40 minutes I was on the bus ! (Thank fuck !!!!)  As happy as Larry !! Plus they back dated the sentance so my remand counted as time served as well !! Hahaha ! 

 Damn I'm high as fuck !! And writting a bloody novel !! I get back to mine and do the bag and this stuff is a bit better and feel great . So I get a treat for the dog and she's a tiny little Lapso Apso only 5 months old and she was the runt and had to be bottle feed si she small even for her breed . So I had chopped up the treat and went up stairs to give her it and dropped a couple of bits besides the bed as I picked it up I noticed a cigarette paper wrapped up in cling film and knee right away it was a bag of heroin !! 😎 Last week I got mad with valium and yes I know that it's very dangerous to mix both drugs !! I thought I'd be ok only taking two !! That I got from a friend and didn't get my own batch as if I did that I'd normally get ma with it and end up eating the lot which is normally 16 tablets for a tenner . So I went home which I can remember with two bags I put one away and did the other one . Shortly after I have zero memory woke up the next morning and my mum told me I was absolutely out my nut and filmed me which she showed me . My mum keeps my money so I can budget better and not spend it all at once . I wanted £10 to go into town and get another bag which I didn't really understand until tonight but mystery solved!! Wish I had found it an hour before I got another bag but hey what ever. It's been s good night ! Plus I'm quite enjoying The Umbrella Academy . 

  Oh I almost forgot I had my referral today at my local Health centre/GP which was pretty handy and didn't have to travel to the local hospital /mental health facility which would have been a pain to get to as I'd need to get two buses and would most likely cost over ten pounds to get there and back so they came to me and was only a  5 minute walk . There was two of them one I think was in training as she was quite young and a woman in her early 30s . Since I've been on methadone before they didn't really need to explain much and they where still giving out the same booklets they where 10 plus years ago . I just went over my drug history when I started what drugs I was currently taking and what I wanted out the program which is basically stability and to get some money behind me and get my house decorated and get cooking facilities that I don't have at the moment . As just now every penny goes on heroin . So I have no disposable income . Plus the council is unwilling to help . A few weeks ago I got notified ""someone"" my old bat of a neighbour who I fucking cut her grass for her !! Lifted the phone and told the council I wasn't living in the house . I really don't get why someone would try and grass someone in off their own back !! But it kinda back fired as I was upfront and told the guy who came out to the house the truth that I wasn't staying there full time as I had no cooking facilities and not even a fridge or microwave at the time (got both now) and he understood and referred to to a couple of organisations that are going to help me . Though I just got word I got rejected by the council again . But I'm going to appeal it . 

   When I applied for a council house I had no idea that I'd get offered a house if 4 WEEKS !!!  First place they offered might have well been in Syria !! First it was 30 miles from where I grew up or know any one !! Plus the flats looked like they had been built by communist Russians !! Lol a horrible concrete grey area of the town and a 5 minute Google search of it told me to avoid it like the plage .

About  2 weeks later I got another offer in my town in a really rough area filled with drug dealers ,muggings ,assaults and a few stabbings and slashings . Plus it was a poxy bedsit basically what you guys call a studio flat I think a largish one room property living room and kitchen combined with a broom closet for a bedroom . I even knew the guy that last stayed in it and had been in it a few times so that was a no !! .

 Next place was only a mile and a half away from me in the next village over a nice little bungalow 😁 it was just about perfect in a good quiet area though even further from town . But the bungalow was just recently out fitted for a disabled person !! Like all brand new stuff almost all the banisters, a slight run way into the front door, a new wet room etc . Why the hell they where offering it to me I had no idea as apart from addiction I'm perfectly healthy and able bodied . So out of respect I turned it down and this time went in to their offices myself and asked them what they where playing at !!?? The woman looked/treated me like I was crazy at first and couldn't understand why I was turning down a good property but soon realised my objections and I made them promise/try to give it to someone that actually reality needed it !! My friend lives just a hundred or so meters  away and has told me someone in s wheel chair moved in . I also didn't want to move there as there's a bit of bad blood as my brother killed someone in that village by total accident (crash) and his wife just won't let it go !! Plus he got screwed over at court/police he shouldn't have even been charged as it was a complete accident . My Auntie works for the Met down in England and she has reduced duties due to her back and it's basically her job to decide if there's enough evidence or its in the public's interest to charge someone and she said if it came across her desk he wouldn't have been charged with what he was charged with . The police didn't even interview him FFS !!! Months later he just got a letter through the door he was being charged and would need to get a lawyer and go to court . 

The guy that got killed had a son in the local police and I think some of the family had some well to do folk in local government as well . So he was rail roaded they tried to say he was a bit racer etc even though he was going the speed limit and made a simple over taking mistake . Plus he had the car two days and it was proven the back end was faulty and it wasn't properly checked they are ment to do like a 100 odd point check but this wasn't done . Plus on the guys small van you could turn off the driver airbags for some insane reason and he did this for some reason !! And it was the steering column that killed him by crushing his chest. 

All this and other things where completely ignored plus the cop son some how managed to sneak into court even though he knew he wasn't allowed into court . I wasn't allowed to go as I can some times have a mouth on me and I'm no stranger to courts and have no problem speaking my mind I've had to defend myself a couple of times when my lawyer or underling  has failed to turn up . I've told the judge to go fuck themselves etc a couple if times . One judge I knew have me  two weeks in  prison just to be a cunt as he knew me and this was at the district court where NO ONE GETE THE JAIL ! Or very rarely !  So I started giving him abuse so I was in contempt of court . Plus I used to work for the fucking stuck up cunt !! As he owned a restaurant which was very posh and expensive though the food was 5 🌟 and I learned alot ! As everything was made from scratch ! And there was a shit tonne of prep work . I was at college training to be a chef at the time (16 years old)  so I was basically the KP kitchen porter/bus boy and every other kitchen position when needed valuable training yes but of course this was abused !! But me being me I didn't put up with that shit ! Kinda got on trouble but the head chef understood where I was coming from and they treated me a bit different from my friend who got me the job there and was also in my class . He was a really mellow dude and constantly smoke hash !! He had a joint in his mouth when ever he could !! . 

  When you worked there you got absolutely nothing to eat !! And got in serious trouble if you did ! Plus that arsehole would come in every so often and try and lord it up all over us . Normally banging on about his stupid rules etc Never worked in a kitchen like it ! Food and the odd coca cola or even a sneeky beer or alchopop which is easier to hide are normally a perk of the job as long as your not taking the piss and making yourself fillet steak every day once a week maybe !! Lol In other places if the bar staff etc  ordered something I'd go out my way to give them extra as they where still paying a bit of money to it . I'd make awesome huge burgers or if they orders a cheap steak I'd give them s better one or make them a huge mixed grill etc . They in return would do you drinks when you wanted them and not the concentrated orange juice or blackcurrant you were supposed to get . Though a Smirnoff ice and blackcurrant was one of my favs !! The amount of alchoholic chefs is quite surprising !! And drinking at work was very common or drug taking . 

  End up my brother got 6 fucking years !!! Bit he appealed it and he got 4 years but they kept it over 3yrs 8 months so he wouldn't get half remission and become licence when he got out . He got to an open prison pretty fast though and did 3 weeks in one week out . But the idiot got caught with a soda can pie and tiny bit if legal high and got sent back to normal  jail but managed to get back to an open after a few months of keeping his nose clean . 

   My bro is really into his football and likes to go to the Rangers home matches when they are on . There's a club bus that departs from that village and is organised from there and that fucking cow found out and got him fucking batted from the bus !!! She wrote a letter to the chairman and they got another couple of anon letters about him and they asked him not to come back !! THIS REALLY PISSED ME OFF !! If it where up to me I would have done something in retaliation yes it's petty and most likely criminal but I would have felt better about it . But I need to respect my bros wishes so I didn't do anything. Also not that money matters and certainly can't bring back a lived one  but the guy was also insured up to the max and she got ALOT of money from the accident and I mean serious 💰💰💰 she also places flowers at the crash site constantly !! And it's been nearly 10 years !! Fresh ones are there all year round and we travel this road most days . I know it sounds really bad but come to fuck !! How long are you going to greave for until you start moving on !! If anything it's just not healthy !! The fields where it happened are up for sale so I think she has been told to stop putting them there as it'll obviously affect potential customers . The small streach of road is an accident black spot and people crash there ALL THE TIME . When my bro crashed about a week and a half later they resurfaced the road and put down road markings not to over take . Something that wasn't there when my bro crashed but they said was there when he did crash that was a complete lie !! You could have easily have used Google maps to disprove this deception but I'm not even sure his lawyers did . Like I said the whole court case was a sham !! When he got found guilty/sentenced the wife had an out hurts of ""We did it"" that when I heard if this I found highly suspicious !!! DID WHAT ?? They should have had no hand in court proceedings !! 

  Anyway that's all in the past and my bro has moved on well apart from the recent football bus petty shit !! I'm just looking forward to the 20th and I can get my script !! Apparently I'll get it that day and they now set up the chemist for you as back in the day you had to find one yourself and had to go from chemist to chemist with the actual script and try and get into one relatively close to where you lived . I just have to repeat what I said to the nurses and give a piss test probably to prove you have opiates in your system had have some what of a tolerance and your not going to get 30 ml and OD an hour or so later ! You used to have to go to the hospital in withdrawal and they would give you 10ml and hour or so and see what amount stabilised you and constantly take your vitals but they don't do it that way any more thankfully we it could take hours . Now it just a quick chat tell you what's expected of you like turning up to appointments , if you want a weekly worker and apparently there are workers now that actually have experience !!! And have either been clean for years or are on a maintance program . I think this is a brilliant idea !! As being told some bullshit about addiction from some drug worker in their early 20s that's never even had a cigarette in their mouth used to annoy me to no end !!!  Like the nurse today telling me how all the heroin going about just now is crap ! I'm like how do you know that ?? Have you tried loads of different bags from local dealers ? Her:umm no obviously not . Me: Ao you've had lots of recent batches tested or got information from police raids on confiscated heroin ? Her: ehhh no. So why say something like that if you don't actually know ?? She then quickly change the subject !! 

  Hope everyone is doing well and your not in WD through lack of funds or much  worse you can't score any where !! All  best from bonnie Scotland !!

I’m writing a research paper on prescription opioids and wondering if anyone here could help me with a few questions:

I’m trying to understand common ingestion methods:

How do you ingest you medications I.e swallow capsules whole, chew capsules, inhale a crushed capsules, I.V? Please let me know if there are any other ingestion methods I may be missing.

Also if you habitually use heroin instead of pharmaceutical, can you help me understand how long you used pharmacy before switching. As well besides price is there any noticeable difference in the euphoric feeling between a pharma and street heroin.

If you don’t want to public ally and you can PM me to. 

I can’t thank everyone here who would be willing to help me out.

Side note, I am earning a masters in healthcare administration and have become fascinated with the use of prescription drugs in general in this country.

Thanks!!!!

Or just let it be?,"Long story short I was with someone who was addicted to opiates. I found out because they stole thousands of dollars for me. We broke up because the trust could never be repaired. I have forgiven them and check up with them every once in a while. 

I go meet up with them every once in a while and the itching and small pupils give it away when this person has relapsed. Sometimes they tell me they're clean other times they tell me they've struggled in the past and had a relapse but never when the relapse happens. The conversations are short and I just listen and tell them that relapse is normal. This person does not go into detail about their substance use so I try to respect that. I know a lot more about their past substance use through others than they think I do but I never bring it up. 

I understand why they would not go into detail or bring it up and I dont want to pry. I dont want to judge or stigmatize this person or even tell them to stop using if they are. I just want to have a conversation about naloxone, clean needles, not using alone and make sure that they're using harm reduction services. Should I bring up this conversation with them? I dont want this person to think I'm judging them especially because theres a lot of stigma, history between us and they only briefly mention relapse after they're clean again. I just want to make sure they dont die and get them supplies if they dont have them. Any advice would be appreciated.",1551922675.0

He often, but not always, uses any day he can afford to, and when he does, it's multiple times per day. I even used to sell him acetyl- and butyl-fentanyl, and his purchase pattern was the familiar one we all know well.

*However*, he says that when he can't score D, he gets at the absolute most extremely mild WD symptoms, a bit of a runny nose and some yawning. And in the time that I've known him, used with him, sold to and bought from him, he has never been visibly sick.

I've tried to Google it and also run searches through academic journals, but I've not found anything about immunity to opioid withdrawals.  

Any of you experience this personally or know someone with a similar claim? He does go through alcohol withdrawals when he drinks like that, so it's just like that with opies. It is the kind of flex that someone might make up, but I really doubt it with this guy. He knows that a lie like that is a great way to not get help if you're legit sick.

I've told him that if it's true, he needs to put his body and brain into the hands of science when he dies. At the very least, it would be extremely interesting, but it could likely also pave the way for novel, highly effective treatments for recovery/detox and rewrite the book on the neurology/physiology of opioid addiction.

I got my first dose this morning which was 25 mg, I didn’t actually feel anything but well from the dose, literally NOTHING but well, But I didn’t expect much because I have a very high tolerance. So my guy just hits me up and he owes me 100 mg which is what I usually take to feel good, my question is would it still be worth it to take the 100mgs??? I took my dose this morning around 8 AM and it’s about 5 PM at night now so it’s been about 9 to 10 hours since I dosed the done. 

I read that methadone doesn’t start fully attaching to all of your receptors until the year about 70 to 80 mg mark so since I only took 25 this morning I assume I’m straight but if I’m not any advice would help, thank you guys!

summary: I dosed my first methadone dose ever this morning at 25mgs, since this is a low-dose And it’s now been about 10 hours, will I still feel 100mg of oxy or hydro?",1551913038.0

ay4uen,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/ay4uen/a_question_about_withdrawal/,13,https://redd.it/ay4uen,spinox,A Question About Withdrawal,"So I ran out of dope about a week ago, and started dosing with hydromorphone and oxy to keep from withdrawing. I'm not super into heroin anymore anyway, even though I've been doing it all day every day for over a year. Mostly because it doesn't make me feel high anymore, just normal. I've heard people that have been addicts for 5+ years have this problem along with a huge tolerance but I don't even have a tolerance like that. 15mg of oxy still puts me on my ass, but doesn't make me feel high. Just dopey. So the fact that my once favorite euphoric as hell drug ever, no longer does anything for me, is pretty depressing. Blessing in disguise? Bah. 

Anyway...

My question is, when I stop taking these other opioids, will I withdraw as bad as I would if I had stopped while taking only heroin? 

I've heard people switch to methadone to then quit more easily, same thing with Kratom. So if I'm not actually doing heroin, am I just postponing my sickness or am I really getting clean and on the right track? I'm worried I'm just replacing one addiction with another.

&#x200B;

I started using a couple years ago, I smoked H on and off for a while (an average of twice a month). When I felt distressed, up to twice a week. I never became a heavy user (well, not yet), and I have not smoked since December. I maintained a very average life, getting C's at University, working a minimum wage job etc. Most people I know, including many cokeheads (along with some ketheads and the odd crack user), alienated me once they found out. Maybe I shouldn't blame them (not sure I do) but my heroin use didn't affect anyone. The experience blew my mind, more than smoking heroin did. I study Human Geography and I have decided to undertake a dissertation that focuses on the stigmatisation of heroin. I will be looking into various outbreaks, treatment programs etc. Where I live, there is an extremely strong correlation assumed between poverty and heroin use (not in the sense that heroin makes you poor but in the sense that only the poor, in every sense of the word, will consider taking heroin). I want to investigate this narrative in depth. It would be great to hear your thoughts, but I am not necessarily looking for a specific explanation in response to a specific question. I would love to hear absolutely any experience or thoughts you have personally had, it terms of being ousted from society. My study will have a spatial element so any thoughts on how you experience certain space. Spaces you feel excluded by versus spaces, or moments, where you feel secure. This can also be discussed in terms of actually being high. Absolutely anything you can think of.

&#x200B;

I want to remind everyone: I am not trying to romanticise heroin or advocate its use. I am also not, in the slightest, trying to claim that I am immune to addiction, who knows what will happen in the future. I simply want to learn about people's experience of either, being alienated or alienating themselves. I just want to hear your feelings.

As the title says I was getting clean. After days of essentially having the flu and wanting to die I said fuck it I’ll got to the movies tomorrow by myself. What I didn’t expect was I was at the really sensitive and easy to cry part of the quitting process. Idk if it’s like this for many other theatres but out the one right near me you get really comfy lounge type seats where u push a button and a guy comes to take your order. They have a lot of good meals on their menu which is great. 

Trailers start. I see the trailer for “dogs journey” I think it was called. Cried during that. I was really quiet and there were barely any people so no one could ever tell. Towards the end of the movie I was emotional again. When it was over and I headed out to my car it was snowing beautifully. I didn’t even know it was supposed to snow. Driving back was so beautiful and coupling that with me thinking back on the movie and here come the emotions. 

The thing about that whole experience was that it actually felt amazing. As someone who has been emotionally blunted for a long time it was so foreign to me when I actually got emotional. It felt great to actually get some tears out. Tbh I wish I could play that all out again. What’s the reason for writing all this nonsense that no one cares about? This was a really nice experience that I only got when I decided to quit using opioids. If this little story helps even just one person to think about quitting then I’ll have done my duty.

If so how did it start and when? How do you feel opiates have changed your high school life as opposed to the rest of the kids in your school? 

I’ll start. I sold a lot of weed sophomore year. I started selling a lotta coke junior year (and doing a lot too lol). But in the middle of my junior year I started sellin dope, mostly to older people cuz nobody my age did it. But of course I started to it but I thought it was okay because I had money. I got addicted late junior year. But I feel opiates took a lot from how high school was supposed to be for me. I would miss school a lot or dismiss myself from school because I was sick. I would skip lunch and sit in the bathroom sometimes because I didn’t wanna eat or was depressed from being dopesick. I didn’t have any “school spirit” compared to all of my friends, and I even remember skipping big pep rallies and assemblies to leave school early without getting caught to get well. Needless to say my grades suffered and so did my attendance. I feel if I wasn’t on opiates, or at least didn’t get physically addicted to them, I would’ve had a much better high school career with better memories. It affected a lot of my friendships in school too. 

In my school we would have a week of shop or vocations and then a week of academics. There was 12 of us in shop. Only 1-2 of kids in my shop knew what I was sniffing all the time in school because they were close to me. But others started to get suspicious and think it wasn’t coke that I was sniffing in shop because I’d fall asleep right after lol and I’m positive my shop teacher knew I was an addict, yet for some reason he chose me out of everyone in the shop to work for his company after we graduated. Anyway I’m rambling here. I guess what I wanna say is that being addicted to opiates took a lot of my teen and high school life from me. High school should be fun for kids. Nobody that age should be at school worrying about being dopesick. If I could go back and do it all over again, I would. But I can’t take back what I’ve done and I’ve gotta try to do right for right now and the future and let the past be the past. Let me know your experiences with opiates and high school below. Thanks

I’ve been on suboxone for about a year now. I researched Tia and decided to give it a go. Ordered 15 grams of the sodium and did all 15g over a 5 day span.  The high was great but nothing to write home about.  Waited about 28 hours after my last sub to dose the tia. Felt great for the first 2 days but just felt like I was getting well for the remaining 3 days. I think coming off the subs affected the outcome of it. 

After those 5 days I waited 24 hours to go back on the suboxone to prevent and pwds that may occur even though tia is a TCA, it still an agonist on the Mu receptors. 

Dosed 2mg of Subs to be safe and after an hour I didn’t get any adverse effects so I continued to dose my normal 8mg. I still got no relief from withdrawals so I did another 8mg. Still nothing...
I ended up doing a total of 32mg of buprenorphine to try and saturate my receptors and it still barely touched the WDs.  Was able to sleep last night but not comfortably. 

I’m closer to 48 hours without tia now and still get hold/cold sweats and mild WDs even on suboxone.  Just stick to normal drugs if you can kiddos and take my word for it that Tianeptine ain’t worth it.

https://i.redd.it/ood46ec7wik21.jpg

Long story, short.. I began using and abusing hydrocodone off and on around 2008/2009. I’ve also been around the block more than I can count with morphine sulfate, oxymorphone (OPANA, mmmm…), hydromorphone, fentanyl, etc. Around the time my mother became terminally with cancer in mid-2012, I began using #4 heroin (insufflated only) and A LOT of it. A best friend “gifted” me with around $1.2M cash after she passed away (\*an entirely other story, in and of itself!\*) and things began to get out of hand. With the help of my wife, who I met while trying to self detox in the summer of July 2013 and with the help of Suboxone, I eventually got clean (other than Kratom) in late 2017. However, also in late 2017; my health problems came to a crescendo and I essentially was diagnosed with spondylosis arthritis in my neck, three extruding discs (one in my neck, other two in lower back), scoliosis of the spine, degenerative disc disease and also.. Cubital, Guyon’s and Carpal Tunnel Syndrome in both hands/wrists. My PCP started treating me with steroids and tramadol. The pain was so intense and persistent, he eventually had me taking 10mg of hydrocodone, x4 day. 

&#x200B;

Eventually it was obvious my pain levels and quality of life was so unmanageable, he referred me to a pain management doctor. He’s been a WONDERFULLY attentive and empathic physician so far. He started me off with Percocet, 10mg, x4 day. The APAP was horrible on my stomach and liver, so he eventually switched me to Oxycodone, 10mg, x4 day. It helped a bit, but not quite enough to get me through a full work day on my feet. So, as of today, I’m prescribed Oxycodone, 15mg, x3 day.. however, I usually take x4 day and take the weekend off. During my last visit this past Monday, he offered to also write my a script for medical marijuana; because of the synergy between the two, many patients end up having to take less of the opiates.

&#x200B;

My wife is understandably wary, but I have a daily pill container and a chart to keep track of my usage and allow her to count the pills at the end of each day. I admittedly will usually take 1.5 orally and insufflate the other 1.5 - but it usually just depends on whether I need help with “break through pain” or longer lasting relief. Sorry to ramble.. but I always see other people posting pics of their stash and after receiving my script for the month this morning, I became elated and wanted to share - it does indeed feel like my birthday! ..although it technically falls on the 19th. Cheers to all my fellow Pisces, March Birthday’ers, chronic pain suffers and opiate aficionados. Good day, everyone! ",1551888704.0

I’ve dabbled in a few drugs, and have definitely a slight addictive mentality. I just know. I can feel it in my bones that heroin would be the most beautiful thing. I have been thinking about it a lot. I want to escape myself. I truly do. I have self destructive tendencies but have a good brain on me. I am thinking, purely hypothetically as I would never do H right now, if I were to graduate and become a practicing doctor for a decade or two. Save up. Have a couple hundred grand. And seriously monitor it. Couldn’t I have the absolute time of my life? It seems a lot of problems with H comes from financial loss and all the shitty behavior of fucking others over to get money. But wouldn’t it be feasible to do it if you had the cash and seriously limited yourself to only the weekends? or didn’t go on absolute junkie benders. But took it reasonably through the day and didn’t lose all sense of self and responsibility. And you could maintain your job too. You’d have the time of your life. It seems like maybe you could have he best of both worlds. And say, if you start getting really bad or it’s not enjoyable anymore you could just commit suicide after a decade or two of pure bliss.

Maybe I’m being naive but I really feel like there is a way to do it in a sustained healthy lifestyle way. You could even willingly withdraw for a while just to loosen the effects. as for other people like wives and children I do not want any long term wife, I prefer having serveral women at a time as I’ve been doing for the last few years.

It’s all about getting sweaty…,"A huge topic around here is how to get through withdrawal, both acute and post acute varieties. Having gone through my own ct wd not that long ago and still being slightly sketchy, this is a subject of huge interest to me. Plus I am a bit of a science nerd so I like this stuff.

There have been a multiplicity of recommendations regarding the best way to hack your withdrawal. Supplements, comfort drugs, and so forth. But the one method to rule them all is exercise. Probably something like 90% of people here recommend it.

I am all about sweating. It has been a huge help to me and improves my shitty mood, especially in the morning. But what if there was a way to speed up your withdrawal and not even have to go out in the cold to run?

Saunas have been around for a long time. They generate intense heat, which allows you to sweat without having to run anywhere.

These days, people like to study and will study virtually anything. One studious person is Dr. Rhonda Patrick, Phd. She is a researcher, public speaker and pretty damn good looking too.

She has a bs in biochem and her doctorate is in biomedical science. So not a lightweight.

It turns out that a 20 minute sauna bath can raise endorphin levels in your brain, plus do many other amazing things like:

Helps grow new brain cells.

Helps your brain function faster.

Improves memory, attention and focus.

My take, if you just too freakin sick to run anywhere, find a sauna. You will feel at least a little better, and maybe a lot better.

Now I would normally never try something you guys shit on, cus your opinion is usually spot on. However its dry times and I'm considering it.

If I take the more or less equivalent dose of tapentadol in the late evening, which should be around 250mg, will I be able to sleep? Or is the stimulation from it too in your face?

I’m fucking scared.,"Sorry for getting all up in your guys’ corner of the world. I’ve never posted cause I want you all to have a safe spot. Just don’t know where else to run. Had to call 911 tonight. First time I’ve ever done that. First time I’ve ever seen a person’s face that color. I thought I lost him, I really did. I looked back at my phone log and I was shocked to see the 911 call was only 3 minutes. It felt like a lifetime. 

Idk, in some way I feel like I really fucked up. Maybe I should have given him more time to get out of the nod. By time the cops came knocking on the bathroom door he was semi-alert again to the point that he was eventually able to get himself out of the bathroom to get his vitals taken. They didn’t narcan him and let him sign AMA and not get checked out at the hospital. Maybe I shouldn’t have gotten outside parties involved. I didn’t even think about cops coming. He’s never gonna forgive me for this when he finally sobers up tomorrow and realizes the jeopardy we may potentially be in. But I’ve never seen anyone turn that color before. It will haunt me for life.

Paramedics even pointed out that all our neighbors were outside staring. Our landlord lives just a couple apartments over. I had just had a discussion with her hours before about us needing to sign a new lease. I fear now we may get evicted. I am beginning to regret all this. But I will never be able to unsee his face. 

I’m not gonna lecture anyone, I know it’s not easy and no one really asks for or wants this life. But if there’s anything I can say, is that there’s gotta be at least one person in your life that wants you to stick around. Even if it’s a fellow bropiate. People care. People don’t want to ever see you turn that color. 

if you think you’ve overcome your addiction and that’s in your past, with all due respect don’t get too full of yourself. he was sober over 2 years other than methadone. he tapered from 100mg down to 11 over the course of the last 2 years. it just got too hard and he reached his breaking point. and i let him. i fucking let him. at worst i thought he was relapsing. it never even occurred to me that i would see his face then that color. 

usually i’m emotional and screaming and crying, but I don’t think i’ve shed a single tear through this whole ordeal tonight. I feel numb and sick and regretful. I feel angry and confused and anxious. The negative feelings will hopefully go away with time. But I  never forget the color his face turned tonight. 
  
stay safe. i love you. 

edit: thanks for the kind words. sorry for invading your guys’ safe space. i’ve been lurking here for years but i never comment cause i don’t want to be the ‘outsider’ making anyone uncomfortable or feeling judged. 

hopefully he’s out of the woods. he’s been up on and off, he’s apologized a million times and said this is the wake up call he needed. he goes to the clinic on thursday to get his bottles so he’s going to try to go up a bit until he gets acclimated. i think we were both so excited and hopeful that he was getting so close to getting off methadone, he pushed himself too hard. 

im grateful he’s alive. i’m grateful to be alive. im grateful that everyone reading this is alive. my inbox is always open if anyone ever needs an open ear. thanks again all for allowing me to get this out. no one in my life (other than his family) knows about his addiction so it’s really lonely and scary sometimes. 

double edit: i sincerely can’t thank you all enough for your kind replies. thanks so much for making me feel just as safe as i want all you to feel. take care out there, because there are strangers like me that care about you all! thanks again for letting me ramble away and not putting me down like other subs might :) ",1551853194.0

The first four days were so awful with all the typical withdrawal symptoms. I went to the doctor day 3 and they rxed ambien to help with the sleep and Lexapro to help with my underlying anxiety and depression issues. The physical symptoms have pretty much stopped but I still have ZERO energy throughout the day and have trouble being happy in anything. How long until I feel normal again? It’s really effecting my job and taking care of my family. I’m so glad I stopped and got off of it but just want to feel good again.

Any help would be appreciated!

I've been shooting for probably 4 of those years. It's been 2 and a half years since I did the 38 days in jail, so I've been daily since then. I have a 2 year prison sentence on the shelf while on probation for the 2 years as long as I don't fuck up. It's going to be at least 2 or 3 months until I'm sentenced probably and start the probation. The heroin that I get around here isn't actually heroin and I suspect it's not even really fentanyl to be honest. People say they have gone 5+ days in rehab and done subs and still gone through precip with the stuff around here. So I'm wondering if anyone has experience going to hydros from heroin and coming off that. 

Also, going from hydros to sub, how long of a wait? I'm reading as little as 6 hours, I would wait at least 24+ hours just wondering if anyone has experience.

Ideally I would like to start snorting the H(whatever it is), go to pills and taper off that. Eating the pills not snorting. Although whether I can get 5s or 10s is a hard question and how much it would cost. If I went to pills, then to subs, how hard would that taper be?

 Any advice or help would be appreciated. Thanks.",1551836837.0

axsqjn,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/axsqjn/methadone_not_working_after_using/,6,https://redd.it/axsqjn,harmproduction,Methadone not working after using?,"Hey everyone, 

I'm new, so please feel free to crucify my ass if I missed something in the rules/common threads that I should have referred to.

My tolerance is insane. It's been this way since 6 months after my first heroin use. I don't remember if my doses of other opiates (hydromorph, oxycontin, oxycodone) were higher than others. I have never overdosed (no ego shit) despite using much more of the same dope than others (with similar use patterns) who overdosed.

I'm on methadone- 80mg. I was stable on 55mg but had to go up again a few times because I used (no more than 2 days of use) and my methadone wouldn't work properly. So up I'd go just to almost-stabilize. 80mg and clonidine kept withdrawal about 95% at bay- and then I used again. This time for 3 days. And wow. Even with my methadone, I have cold sweats, anxiety, yawning and sniffles, achiness. So then it becomes hard to get through that for ~4 days to the other side. So I use, and back to square one again.

Not one substitute user I know relates to this experience (shit-cycle?) when I ask about it. My doctor gives me absolutely no answer as to whether this is normal.

TLDR: My tolerance seems to have absolutely no fucking ceiling, my methadone doesn't work after I use (even briefly) and I can use an ignorant amount of heavy dope without getting a rush, let alone ODing.

Can ANYONE understand this shit?!",1551834116.0

I have always used heroin. I used hydrocodone when I was younger and occasionally when I was using heroin if I got ahold of some for free or a script. I have rarely done oxycodone either. I took some Percocet 5 and 10s years ago, done oxycodone 30mg 2 times 
I time I did 2 and and one time 4 thought I would like to experiment with this more if I had access. I did Oxy a long time ago in year 2000-2001 and tried an 80 once and a 160 once. In year 2012 I tried the OP 80 and cutting it up was like trying to cut up a pill that was a rubber eraser mixed with candle wax. I was never able to ever try Opana or Dilaudid which I have always wanted to. Dope always just seemed stronger in comparison to price range and much more affordable. 
I have never tried morphine which I have heard was very weak and also heard it was good 
I have also seen a lot of pics of codeine pills, isn’t that the weakest opiate there is ? Are they even worth taking and how are morphine pills ? Are morphine pills and MS Contin (Morphine Sulfate) basically the same thing
I had a friend who got them from his dad at a relatively high dose  and took them all and said that morphine sucked ",1551829979.0
