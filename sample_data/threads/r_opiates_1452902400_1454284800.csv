Turns out that in my brothers attempt to hide what drugs he was dealing with, but still wanting to tell his wife I did something bad, he goes and tells her I stole a bunch of pills from him. (It was one suboxone strip and I returned it to him)

I walk downstairs with her yelling on the phone and she proceeds to yell at me about stealing pills because she's already in a pissy mood. I'm completely lost as I honestly had no idea what she was talking about, so we argur about it then she said something about them being in the mailbox and right then I knew he made up some bullshit to tell her about what I did.

I already admitted fault to him about my actions, I told him that same night. The fact he has made it seem worse than it is by lying to her about what I've done is a bit messed up. She's going to want to end up kicking me out because he's trying to cover his own ass drug wise. He'd be divorced in an instant if she knew what drugs he usually does often, such as meth, oxy and suboxone. He probably told her it was valium or klonopin which she doesn't care about as much.

Guess I'm facing the consequences of what I did, but if she ends up trying to kick me out because of his lies to her, I'm going to have to basically blackmail my own brother and tell him that he needs to not let that happen, or she's going to learn a lot of shit he doesn't want her to know.

I completely admitted my wrong in what I did. He's trying to cover his ass now by lying to her and in doing that, I get in a lot more trouble for things i didn't actually do.

There was a lot of powder, more than I expected... Since I only had a regular 1ml/1cc syringe, I needed to do it in two shots. I used a cotton to filter it when drawing up, and did the two shots. I really didn't feel anything, probably because my small syringe couldn't fit enough... (I wonder if I went to like the Tractor Supply store and got a 10 or 20ml/cc syringe and put a good amount in it, like 1200mg+ [1200mg is my prescribed dosage btw] I might feel pretty good. Not necessarily expecting a rush, but at least a way quicker onset than 2 hours, and better bioavailability.)

Long time lurker and long time CHIPer here. I've been doing dope for about 3 years, pretty much every other weekend.

I know bodies are all different but if you hadn't done dope in ~21 days, used .45g per day for 3 days and stopped, would you experience withdrawals?

First of all thanks to everyone who reads and responds, feels like I really need someone to talk to. Sitting here bored out of my mind craving some of that sweet H. Been using (snorting only, no IV) every day for about 4 months or so. To put it in perspective, I've been going through an 8-ball about every 10-14 days.

Except this past Friday my guy who is always incredibly consistent tells me he's dry for a couple weeks and I'm left with no connects. No oxy, Percs, nothing. So I've been suffering WDs all week...holy hell I never knew anything could be quite so awful. The only real symptom I had was lethargy (and some very minor RLS) but it was absolutely terrible. Could barely move out of bed to go take a piss, didn't eat for a couple days straight, etc. Xanax helped with the insomnia. And it caused me to almost fuck up some responsibilities in my life because I couldn't get out of bed for shit.

 Fortunately I'm feeling just about all better now, thank god. And yet despite how terrible this week has been I know I'm going right back to the H as soon as my guy is good. I can't help it, no matter how bad the withdrawals are, being high on H is absolute paradise and I'll continue my use for as long as I can afford it. All my social anxiety, gone. Like I've never felt before. I'm sure I won't be judged for my opinions in this sub though. 

Also my SO has no idea of my use whatsoever. I'm pretty good at keeping it hidden.

So I married an amazing dude who has had heroin troubles and struggles in the past. I'm a crippling alcoholic, whatever. Getting high & drunk is fine and dandy unless it interferes with jobs or lands one in jail. Home use, personal responsibility, blah blah blah. 

Anyway- He started up on the heroin again. I was curious. He shot me up- I loved it. Cue 3 days of us just getting wicked fucking high and loving it. I said at the beginning of the binge that Monday was the last day for a while because I don't want to see him go down that hole again, and I certainly don't want to go down it. I told him we have a talk coming about the difference between 'recreational' use and 'habitual use,' to which he replies ""I know honey, but not right now.""

However, I can see myself loving the fuck out of occasional heroin usage. Everything I've seen and read and lurked on says such a state is not possible. 

I suppose my query to y'all of the opiates sub is two-fold, and likely common. 


1. Is it possible to only occasionally enjoy heroin as a recreational substance- say once a week or so on my day off?

2. How can I my husband about the difference between occasional, weekly use vs. daily use.

I'm actually sober except for my nightly coffee mug full of whiskey (and an ice cube) but I can't sleep and this shit is bothering me. I've asked numerous people in real life what they think, and hear ""It's bullshit"", to ""You're under investigation, and they were probably investigating you before shit went down"" to ""Your buddy rolled"" to ""You're about to be in some real shit"" to ""your court house staff is incompetent and you're overthinking shit like you always do, stfu and watch tv or read a book and be patient"".

So just to preface: I've got an attorney coming to settle this shit but he lives across the state so I'm working on his time. We're going to meet Friday and take care of this shit. I really can't argue because he cleared a fucking day off his schedule to do this, not terribly uncommon around here but still something to keep in mind with timing issues.

Unfortunately rumination is the anxiety caused by obsession with cause and consequence. Solutions don't help stop it.

When I was arrested, I called in an overdose, gave my friend mouth to mouth, then was pulled aside when the police arrived. I pulled my phone from my pocket which prompted the police officer to knock it out of my hand, handcuff me, and detain me. Then I was put into the back of a cop car. My ""friend"" was questioned then arrested, and I was removed from the cop car, searched, and taken to jail for what was found in the search.

I reason probable cause must have popped up in their questioning, . So did my friend rat on me? I know nobody really knows for sure, but this seems to be the most likely. Unless there was a CI statement, I don't get what else could have happened. Maybe the cop thought I was some dumb kid (am I not?) and I'd plea out and even possibly snitch, earning him the longest cop dick of the year award and a fat salary for his fat wife to spend on their fat kids?

They won't give me my phone or a police report. I've asked twice. That is a little fucked up in my opinion. The first day I was told I'd need to talk to a detective about my phone, and that my police report ""wasn't ready""(??). Next day I'm told I need to consent to a search of the phone and unlock it or let the crime lab work on opening it with a search warrant. Whatever.  Police report? Sure, except the guy who does police reports took the day off, so you'll have to come back ""some time next week"". Voucher for my phone, to prove they took my personal property and have it held in evidence? Nope, we will have (Capital city) mail one here and call you when it's ready. I should have gotten one when it was taken. How am I supposed to unlock it and consent to a search if it's 4 hours away anyway exactly? This shit drives me batty, every question I ask the clerk has to run and talk to someone else and come back with the answer. There's no straight answers for me.

I know if I had my attorney asking for this shit there'd be no runaround or excuses. He said he will get the police report and the real story on my phone Monday, and said at best I may have a civil suit not worth filing, at worst I may be in some real shit. Doesn't help the rumination factor.

What the fuck is going on here? Is it just some backwoods dickheadedness? Or should I bail right now? 

No heroin means no sleep so I really can't fucking think and this shit is just eating at me, all night I'm wondering wtf is going on. I'm a very inquisitive person and very intuitive and I absolutely can not fucking stand when I don't understand something, especially something as important to my life as this shit is. It's like they've already gotten in my head, just by innocently being inept/stubborn pricks.

Someone tell me I'ma be alright before I go crazy here. I'm already starting to have bad thoughts and ideas. I hope someone here can help put my mind at ease, because I can't. My brother even said ""I know you, you're going to worry yourself sick about this."" I thought I just had problems with this shit in jail.. it's almost worse being out because now I worry about going back in too.",1453037205.0

I have asked everyone why they don't do it and they all laugh or give me some stupid fucking answer. I also asked a couple other people if they ever wear their seatbelts and the ones that say no never give a good answer. One of the dealers got a little angry and kept insisting his driving was very good and doesn't worry about getting into an accident. I countered with the obvious fact that a lot of times when there are accidents, it's not caused by you but the other driver. He didn't really understand that since he's an ignorant retard so IDK what to think. Another person said ""cars were originally made without seat belts, so who cares?"". I think that's probably the dumbest thing I've heard all year. I said to the kid ""cars have been around for just about 100 years now and they put seat belts in about 90 years ago. What a fucking moron. On top of it all, you're gonna get pulled over if a cop sees you without one on. Why risk it if you're probably riding dirty? 

So wtf? Why would you want to fly out of your windshield if you get into an accident? It's so easy and doesn't keep you from doing anything in the car, so I can't think of any reason other than it not being comfortable (and that's a dumb misconception). I feel naked if I'm in my car without a seat belt on. The only times I skip it are when I'm riding in the back and trying to sleep or something. 

TLDR: tell me why you don't wear your seat belt or if you know why black people seem to think it's not cool or something. Also, WEAR YOUR FUCKING SEAT BELT! Unless you're just a shitty person then keep it off so you die please. 

EDIT: Sorry, it isn't just dealers and such. It's almost every uneducated/irresponsible (black or white, but quite often black) person I've ever met. Sorry if I'm being racist and if that pisses anyone off but (sorry if I seem like I'm justifying racism) stereotypes exist for a reason, at least some of them. Many of them are true about white people and pretty much every race on this planet. Some are inherited but most are products of the way people are brought up and the type of community they live in. This world is so fucked up that it makes simple little things like a strap to keep you alive seem to be a stupid idea. I'd say that this is the same mentality that keeps drugs illegal, other than those who profit off of prohibition making sure they stay that way. ",1452984206.0

My wife, who has suspected for a while, demands to search my car. I say no, because there are rigs, baggies, a spoon, and cottons in there. Everything. She tells me I have to leave if she can't search my car, so I pack a bag, go to my car, drive to the other side off our apartment complex, park, bang, and browse the internet on my phone for a couple hours, make a post to say goodbye, and fall asleep. I wake up to 30 or so missed calls and a dozen texts from my wife, my mom, my dad, and my brother. Apparently, while I was sleeping at about 5am, she calls my whole family, tells them I'm using dope, that she can't get a hold of me, doesn't know where I am, and I might be dead. Jesus. Ok, damage control time. I call everyone, let them know I'm ok, apologize for worrying them, and try to go back to sleep. My wife calls and demands to know where I am. I tell her, so she comes and blocks my car in with hers. We sit there for a bit, arguing on the phone, when my mom shows up. She asks me to go get some breakfast with her and talk, so we go. We eat and talk and head back to find that my wife had somehow gotten into my car, found shit, and then called the motherfucking police, who were there searching my car. I tell them they're doing an illegal search because I'm the only one on the title of the car, I didn't give them permission to enter, and they don't have a warrant. The cop says because of the state we live in, because we are married, any property is technically owned by both of us. I'm pretty sure it was an illegal search because I purchased the car before we got married and she's not on the title but I'll figure that out later with my lawyer. I said fine, if that's her car then anything you find in there is hers, but he said that's not how it works. I said I don't think you know how it works, now please cease your illegal search until you show me a warrant, and get out of the way so I can close my door. He told me that plain view doctrine was now in effect since he had already seen paraphernalia, and I was being detained for being uncooperative. He put me in cuffs and continued to search the car. This took about an hour because he was a dipshit Barney Fife type motherfucker. Now here's the kicker. This entire time, my wife has our 4 year old son standing out there in the cold, watching everything. He's bawling his eyes out, begging mommy to help daddy. It was tragic. All of us, me, my mom, even the cop, pleaded with her to take him home, saying that he didn't need to see this. She refused. What a real bitch, eh? My wife, in my most desperate time of need, completely betrays me by finding drugs in my car and then totally unecessarily calling the police, and then forces our young son to witness it all. I ask you, who is the real monster here? Yes, I lied and did drugs, but what she did was unbelievably fucked up. She still won't admit that she shouldn't have involved the police, or that she shouldn't have forced our confused and distraught son to witness it all. I feel like she stabbed me in the back, and the very last thing she should have done was call the police, but what really sickens me is that she made our kid watch, and refused to take him away despite the desperate pleading of everyone there. That's some fucked up shit. Anyway, I'm looking into voluntary rehab, so that hopefully with that, the fact that it is a first offense, and that it was likely an illegal search, I don't get convicted of a felony or do jail time. So, that's why I'm quitting. It's going to be very difficult because I don't really want to, but that doesn't matter now. Sorry for the wall of text. ",1452976711.0

also, ive only ever taken it orally, as im not into stuff in my nose a whole lot. ive read APAP can give headaches when snorted so Im not sure if i want to. I like how oral makes me feel, Longer and mellower when perscribed. Ive never snorted but i've heard it more awake feeling. I also like to boof stuff (not sure what most peoples terminology for putting drugs in ur butt is, where im from we call it boofing) Ive read that its just as effective and also read that its not. but people write about something with water, essentially dissolving it in water and squirting it up there like an enema, it really sounds like to much work and id rather just take it oral . Why cant i just stick the pill up there, is it not effective if not made into a watery solution?

He is still alive and ok.,"     So I'm over at my friends apartment today. Been here since yesterday around 10. Anyways that doesn't really matter. 

     Anyways, one of my dealers has been staying he might over here. Well he went and picked up some new kill last night probably a little after midnight. Well I guess it is such good stuff that his guy gave him some mannitol, or something to cut it with, and told him you have to cut this. If you don't the shooters will be dying. I want to say that his guy said that 5 people have od'ed on this stuff already. 

     Well we all get some from my dealer and take our shots. It was some pretty good shit, I would have to say so myself. 

     I hadn't slept at all at this point. This is around 6 in he morning now. Everyone is sleeping now, because we stayed up all night smoking clear and black. Earlier in the day my buddy, we will call him R, he had taken a bunch of k-pins earlier in the day. He is prescribed them, not that that matters at all. But anyways I'll get back to the story. It's 6 in the morning I'm just now falling asleep on the couch. My dealer is asleep on the couch too. One of my buddies went to the store to grab some snacks. And one more buddy is well who knows what he was doing. But he was awake. Well appearently the buddy who took he k-pins took a really big shot, or bigger than usual I guess. Well he ended up falling out. The one buddy who was still awake and about hears him go down in the kitchen. He rouses me out of my slumber and say R is od'ing wake up. 

     Well I get up immediately and run to the kitchen. My buddy who watched him fall over is spraying him with a squirter water bottle. Not exactly sure what he was trying to accomplish. My dealer is slapping his face and yelling his name. I'm rubbing his sternum as hard as I can and putting ice on him. But his lips are turning blue. But I notice that the water spray is, well he is reacting to the spray in his face. I tell my buddy who woke me up to get my friend out of the shower right now, I forgot to mention my dealer is getting ready to take a shower he must not have been asleep, so my dealer come out of the bathroom almost naked. I tell him to help me get R to the bathroom and throw him in the cold shower. Well this helps a lot. He is coming out of it. It takes what seems like hours for him to stand up and become fully awake. 

     So he's awake and moving and standing up in the shower. He is crying telling us he is sorry. I keep telling him he doesn't need to say he's sorry it could have been any one of us. Well I make sure he stays awake for at least like 4 or 5 more hours to observe him. But he is super tired. He had been up for at least 2 or 3 days. So I let him go to bed but I lay on the bed next to him to monitor his breathing. He is up and well spirited right now for having been dead for a little bit earlier in the day. He is very adamant about quitting not only shooting up. But quitting dope all together. I tell him if he really wants to quit I'm here for him. And will even quit with him if that helps at all. Scariest thing I've ever experienced in all my years of using and chipping. Certainly a make you think moment. 

TL;DR My friend fell out today at his apartment. My and my dealer got him out of it. Luckily. I was getting. Ready to call 911 and preparing to do CPR on him until the ambulance arrived. Or throwing him in a car whilst doing CPR on him till we can get to a hospital.  ",1453107850.0

Long time meaning like 6 months since I really started. I've been popping oxy/hydro for nearly 3 years now but I would break myself easily. Only do it for like 3 or 4 times a week then stop for like a week. I could make 30mg last me for those four days. 6 months ago I started my current addiction after an emotional breakdown I guess you'd call it that. 6 months in and the max I'll take is 30mg a day and I stay high all day long, that's on oxy. Hydrocodone it's usually like 40mg a day max. Why doesn't my tolerance move like others? I just took a 3 day break, didn't want to but had to, and when I popped my first 10mg norco it lasted for several hours and I got my high that I usually get. Am I blessed? My typical day is 20-25mg oxycodone and I'm high all day for the most part. It's weird in my opinion because I see people saying that after a 30 day binge you'll need 60mg to get a good high. One time I did 50mg oxycodone and thought I was about to die, I seriously thought I had overdosed. And when I was withdrawing, sure it was hell, but it was hell because I couldn't stop about getting high. I didn't have the shits, my nose ran a bit, but I wasn't actually sick. No shivers or anything like that. I just couldn't stop thinking about getting high if that makes sense and it would upset me so I smoked some weed and forgot about it for a little while lol. My addiction is fairly cheap on my salary and I can afford it fairly easily. 


I'm asking a legitimate question. Why don't I build a tolerance like other people do, why aren't my withdraws like others, and why are my tolerance breaks so short?


edit: forgot to add that last week I had 1 5mg perc on me and I was going to the park and popped it (on an empty stomach) and felt amazing. Only on 5mg perc. Oh and I forgot to mention that 150mg of Tram felt like 5mg hydrocodone to me, anyone else get the same feeling?",1453102699.0

Any advice from those who already have a doctor?

This guy drug tests his pain patients, so I'm gonna have to put down the weed, but that's not happening without narcotics because weed is the only drug that helps me sleep at night.

I have already tried 

Naproxen
Tramadol
Benzos
Toradol 
Hydrocodone
Oxycodone
Hydromorphone
And your normal shit like Tylenol.

Needless to say, the otc stuff has done nothing.

I have also tried ambien and other sleep aids, but the pain don't want cease with ambien, however I do sleep. Very weird sleep that leaves me feeling untested.

So help me out people.

I am uninsured so I am hoping that this doctor can get me on a pain management plan that doesn't require specialists or surgery because I cannot afford those options out of pocket, nor do I have the strength to find a job that will give me insurance.

I spit it in a cup (gross but I aint flushing 80 bucks down the jakes unless I have to) to save in case they really are ok.
The numbness lasted about 5 mins. About 5 mins later, I snorted a TINY bit and could tell its an opiate. Ended up snorting over about an hour 3/4 of a pill.

**Part 1:  From the Clouds I Fell**

I stood at the top of one of the highest mountain peaks in the Colorado Rockies.

The ski-patrol uniform I was wearing was of the highest quality. It was insulated to keep me comfortably warm down to sub-zero temperatures. Yet, somehow, I was still shivering.

It was the early morning, so the masses of tourists, ski teams, and ski bums had not yet infiltrated the mountain side. I was happy for that, but I was not happy.

I was surprised to see a clear sky and warm sun above me. We were in the middle of February, and that week seemed hard-pressed to claim itself as the heart of winter. Below zero temperatures had become commonplace.

But not that day. It was as warm as September and I should have been warm as well. I was sweating alright, but it was a cold sweat, and not due to the weather.

I wiped the frost from my outdoor wristwatch and checked the temperature gauge.

“What the… fuck?” I said to myself in disbelief. “It's not cold AT ALL. I even have my damn underlayer on… I should be hot as hell right now.”

But I wasn't. Goosebumps galore along with a persistent shiver. I was starting to experience the withdrawal from the slowly shrinking level of opioids between the receptors in my brain.

The powerful chemical that I had saturated throughout my body earlier that day was monoacetylmorphine, much more commonly referred to as black tar heroin.

So, there I stood, securely locked into my to black and white K2 all-mountain twin-tip skis with my cork fitted Salomon easy-release ski boots, looking vaguely forward.

My vision was directed towards the jaw-dropping panoramic view of the legendary Colorado Rocky Mountain Range. The pristine snow-covered terrain could be seen for hundreds of miles in all directions.

Due to my vantage point on that unusually clear day, I could even see most of the other ski resorts in our vicinity. The scenery was nothing less than magical. The godly view made me feel above the clouds, something like a surreal feeling of heaven on Earth.

That was the situation; and as I remained there, stoically, eyes wide, I was gazing towards the view in front of me. Yet, amazingly, I did not see any of it. I would have seen no less had I been blind.

My focus was turned inward. Seething over my miserable physical detox, obsessing over an insidious idea of using again, and I was unable to shun away either.

The fact that I was partaking in one of my favorite activities, standing in one of the most beautiful places in the world, and working my most enjoyable job, had no such effects on me. Misery, guilt, shame, disappointment, along with a myriad of other depressing feelings overwhelmed my sick mind like a mental tidal wave. 

My thoughts were blaring, and the volume was nearly unbearable.

Interestingly, an unexpected but genuine idea crept through the putrid sludge that filled my head. It quietly said to me:

*You can do this. These thoughts are not you. They do not define you. You cannot control the thoughts that come into your mind, but you can control the ones you act on. Drugs are only a gilded solution to the problems below. Make a choice.*

So, I did make a choice. The one I knew I'd make before I even made it. I buried that thought as deeply as possible, forcing the ephemeral light within me to recede quickly. And I confused this darkness for shade, and decided to stay.

I planted my ski poles vigorously into the icy snow and rocketed off down the mountain.

I was in a desperate hurry. I flew down the steep trail as snow sprayed behind me. I thought I was chasing towards my solution, but I was merely fleeing from my problem. I wanted my solace. I wanted my comfort. I needed my heroin.

Unfortunately for me, derivatives of the poppy plant were hard to come by in the Rockies. Most people were content on the natural highs that the area provided. I would need to head all the way to the state’s capital, Denver, to acquire what I was after. 

I didn't know it at the time, but the journey I embarked on that day would make out to be more perilous than I could have ever imagined. It was surely Zeus himself that threw obstacles throughout my way, but there wasn't one I hesitated to surmount. 

Yes, I finished that day with my medicine; only I wasn't sure if I truly completed the journey. Only a part of me had returned, the rest I lost along the way. 

I skidded to a stop at the bottom of the run and headed to the ski patrol warming hut with an excuse ready to go. After successfully lying to my boss, I was on my way. 

Soon after, I left hastily through my front door -- unknowing that twenty hours later, only a shell of a person would return through it.

It began to snow.

This post turned out longer than I intended, so for a tl;dr skip to the end

This is just something I've noticed recently that I've been wondering about. I have a couple of ideas of why it might be the case, but none of them seem entirely satisfactory to me, so I'm wondering what you guys' take on it is. Injecting into the femoral vein is very rarely discussed, questioned or mentioned on this board, even though talk of injecting generally is extremely commonplace here - this might just be because I haven't lurked enough, but I've actually seen people talking about hitting crazy places like their necks and fingers more than the femoral!

Now, we all know the risks of hitting the femoral - abscesses, blood clots, proximity to arteries etc etc - but all the people I know IRL that do it, don't do it out of ignorance, but necessity. Through years and years of injecting, they have blown literally every other vein on their body, and can't draw blood from any vein at all - except the femoral. I have yet to meet a user who can no longer hit there, and I have been told this is because it's an extremely, extremely thick vein, that it's basically failsafe and impossible to fuck up. These people I'd call acquaintances rather than friends - I live in one of the largest towns in the UK, but it's still a town, and as I imagine everyone can relate to when you're a junkie in a town big enough to have a scene, when you become a heroin addict you quickly get to know a large circle of people who you're on friendly speaking terms with and would chat to, as all the junkies seem to know all the junkies. 

There's a couple reasons that might contribute to this, but none of them seem, to me anyway, to account this disparity of these forums vs IRL entirely. Firstly, basically all of this group graduated from shooting straight heroin to speedballs long, long ago - they all inject crack with their heroin, which AFAIK is a lot worse for your veins than heroin - but then again, so do many people online/here. Also, as we live in the UK, our heroin is exclusively #3, and thus a base, so when you get your free needles/pots at the exchange you also get sachets of citric acid or vit c, which is also worse for your veins than just #4 - but don't you need an acid to inject black tar heroin as well? And it's not like #3 is exclusive to here in the UK. Also, there's of course the length of time and amount, but I'm certain there are plenty of people here who are long-term users who do a lot. 

So none of these reasons seem entirely satisfactory to me. Any thoughts, ideas, opinions? tl;dr I know a lot of people who can only hit their femoral whereas on this site I barely ever see femoral injecting mentioned, why do you think this could be? ",1453207364.0

I had some legit pharma pressed yellow xanax bars (aka school busses in our area).I was askin around and this guy I havent messed with it a while hit me back and says he wants 32 and $5 a pop is cool.  Ok cool ill b there tomorrow morning, which was yesterday.  Dude is on 'done, so he is so much better than me and all my junkie pals, y'all know the type.  So when he takes benzos with the 'done he gets hella zooted, seen him that way plenty of times, but yesterday was the most fucked up Ive ever seen him.  He tells me the bars are for the neighbor, ok cool, I used to get 30s from his neighbor so it all felflt good till that point.  So he runs "" next door"" , that's when I knew someghing was off because it took no more than 2 minutes from him walking out the door to walking, hmmm...  So okay, I had 30 mins to kill anyway, dude Always has really good shatter or wax and offered to dab me out, cool.  So its about time to go, and I ask for my money ($160 for 32 yellow school busses @ $5/per, I pay $4 and can only get 60every month, the whole script) for the last 32 bars for January, which I also cut a deal on since he got them all.  He pulls out a novelty $1,000,000 bill with 3, $1 bills inside and says ""I owe you $20 still"".   
""Ha, Ha.  Nice try nigga"", I said as I threw the $3 on the ground at his feet.
""What you mean, dawg?""  He questioned sheepishly.
""Fuck you mean, dumbass nigga?""
""Oh they got us, dawg?""
""No, *dawg*, *they* didnt get us, *you* got *me*!   Give me my fucking money or my bars right fucking now nigga, I told you I had to dip at exactly 11:00 and youre pulling this at11:05????""

He ends up telling me I need to leave and then pulls out a fuckin meat carving knife from the drawer and was waving that around.  I knew how fucked uphe was so I pulled out a blade of my own and was daring him to fucking get froggy and jump.  Nothin came of that but some shouting, he lives wigh his gramps and the old man came in and I straight up told him what happend cause this grimey dude was telling gramps I was stealing his pills (gramps' pills, legit pain).  Gramps told dude to give me cash or pills, and cut ties with me, and I had to leave after he did that, perfecto, but dude kept up with stories about me, this, that, the other, blah blah  So this guy is pretty big but by big I mean tall and *FAT*, so I know I can take him if it comes down to it, and again the clock is ticking past 11:00 more and more, when I had to leave for an appointment.  So all the sudden dude gets froggy af and takes off his shirt and tells gramps ""fuck it, im just go na whoop this niggqs ass.""   He comes back into the kitchen and speared his fatass halfway thru one wall and then took him down in the corner and start wailing on him.... LMFAO, next thing i know he is saying different variqtions of ""wtf, why cant I get up bro"",  ""you gonna lst me up man?"", etc.   So i decked him 1 last time and calmly asked for the bars, he went and grabbed them from his room and gave em back to me.  When he got up I notice the new iphone 6s that hewas showing me before qll the bs went down qnd braggimg about how he wasnt a junkie anymore and *probably* wouldnt pawn it, smh...

Why am I so infatuated with drug use? I have done my share of drugs to have a good time. Probably more than I should, but it's fun and I'm young so whatever. Most of the time, it's just smoking weed, adderall, xanax, psychs in the summer, but never any type of opiates until recently. 

I had some 5/325 hydrocodones (don't laugh, I know those are no big deal to most of you guys), but I took like 4 or 5 of them on a few occasions and it felt great. I thoroughly enjoyed it but I have no desire to use anymore, simply because I don't really enjoy the process of obtaining prescription drugs without prescriptions. So pretty much, I won't be using opiates again, unless I actually need them.. but for some reason, I study and read about drugs every day. Opiates specifically. It fascinates me to no end. Everything about it. The lifestyle, actually using, people who use, reading this subreddit daily, etc..

First off, my boss hired spotters to check on us; which I find to be really shitty for a boss that considers himself ""my friend"" and has even had christmas dinner with my family. So with that being said, the spotters write my boss a report on each bartender. In my report, apparently it said that I was giving away too many buybacks. This is not the case. I've been giving the same amount of buybacks for the last three years and am not ""giving away the bar"". So now my boss says he can't trust me any more, which is really hurtful because for the last several years, I've worked so hard to help that bar and make it the best it could be. For a year and a half, I managed the bar and made it as accessible by offering a wide selection of beers, liquors, wines, and cocktails, all at affordable prices. My changes and social media management had brought in a lot of new business and made plenty of new regulars. Overall, I've poured my heart and soul into this bar, so much so that I live around the corner just so that I can conveniently be close to help out when needed.


So with that being said, I'm taking this ""letting go"" pretty hard. So I did the only thing I really know how to do when I'm stressed out and down on my luck....and got really, really high. I've nodded off several times just trying to write this post. Some times you just need to be high to deal with these big issues..or better yet not deal with them.

A couple questions,"They're little round pills with m30 imprinted on them. I have some questions as far as dosing is concerned.

My tolerance is pretty high at the moment, I've been messing with hydrocodone and oxycodone for the past month. Thing is, I've been using the ones with APAP in them. I am aware that the ones in my possession now have no APAP, just straight oxy.

So here it goes: my most recent doses were as follows 70 mg hydrocodone on Saturday... 50 mg of oxy two days before that. 47.5 mg of hydrocodone day before that.

So should I be okay popping two of these little fuckers at once? (For a total of 60 mg oxy)? Or is that too much?

I know 5mg of oxy= roughly 7.5 of hydro

My question really is, does the added APAP in Percocet change anything about the effects of the oxy?!

As in, if I took 50 mg of oxy in Percocet form (with APAP)...I should be okay to take 60 mg of just pure oxycodone right? The effects don't differ correct?

A friend of mine told me they're actually night and day. Just needed a little clearance here, any help is appreciated. Thanks guys 👍

What the fuck have I done to myself? Here I sit at 25 years old and have absolutely no idea who I am. What I like. I have no hobbies or friends. All I have ever been or been into is altering my state of mind. 

 At 14 I started drinking and using tobacco. Every weekend and often weekdays was consumed by alcohol. Countless days in high school me and my best friend spent polishing off bottles of Captain Morgan while sitting in my room or in the school parking lot. I never went to school activities or dances. I was a partier and prided myself on it at the time. I mean I was cool right? I had the hookups, I had the party spots. Everyone loved me life was great. By the end of high school I drank almost daily and dropped out when my family went to shit and lost everything in the whole recession nonsense. They moved away and there I was at 18 with my own house and a hefty amount of habits for my age. 

 I had the party house. Every single night was a party. People would just show up random times with drugs or alcohol they would happily share if they could party here so of course i was always down. I worked a stupid labor job that took no skill or thought so I could easily do it under the influence. Marijuana soon became a regular part of life as well as cigarettes. And I LOVED sizzurp (liquid hydrocodone with sprite) I was about as reckless as I could of been. Always drinking and driving and destroying shit. I was just an idiot. Slowly all the people faded away and grew up but I did not. Eventually nobody was showing up to drink everyday or even on weekends so time to move on. No big deal at the time.

 Well what's fun after your life is literally a party? Fucking nothing is what. Everybody I knew had moved on with college or girlfriends but I was ready to party! I ended up having some medical problems that were a huge cluster fuck and mystery to doctors so what did they do? Here is a bunch of meds kid go feel better. Me being me realized quickly how much I loved this oxy I was getting and these benzoes. At 20 I developed a NASTY 400+ pills a month habit of an array of opiates and Benzoes. Klonopin and oxy was always the king to me tho. 

 I quickly learned how easy the medical system is and never had any shortage of pretty much anything I wanted. My doctor was a fucking idiot. I would literally google a medication like klonopin I wanted to try and find the symptoms. I would recite exactly what they were to my doc and walk out with and easy 90 pills to try. Fucking idiot. That was my life for 5 years.

 I always would dabble in psychadelics when the opportunity came but when I was 23 I got really into mushrooms, tripping weekly or even more sometimes. Then my next love LSD came along and oh my god it was amazing. I still hold this drug dear to my heart. Before long I was tripping constantly. Taking a 10 strip at a time like it was no thing.

 The year of being 23 was insane. I would benzo blackout daily take mass amounts of psychadelics and smoke mass amounts of weed plus all the opiates that was just a part o my daily routine by now. While of course selling it all too. I have so many days and even weeks I have no recollection of. I would often come to but be an absolute mess. I would be cut up or in a weird place. And my bank account would always be wrecked after a binge. Everyone in my life had left my side I was by myself with my drugs and that's what I connected with. And only that. 

 Last year I realized this may be a problem but I didn't realize how large of a problem. This was a fucking demon inside me by now. I decided to take action. I detoxed and got clean. It took me 3 goes at it but eventually I did it. Slowly cut out alcohol then tobacco and the last one was marijuana. It all was hell I hated the entire year. It was a long road but eventually I made it and here I stand today

  Now that I have not been using I have never been more lost or terrified. I've never dealt with life or even emotions regularly. I have no passion for anything. All I ever do is want SOMETHING to alter my state of mind. But after being clean for 6+ months I realize I can't enjoy any of the substances anymore. Especially psychadelics. It's a terrifying mess the few times I've tried and at this point I've just given up on them all. Even marijuana makes me anxious and uncomfortable. 

 So what the fuck do I do? I've watched every god damn thing worth watching on netflix. Nobody I used to know wants a damn thing to do with my ex junkie ass. I don't have any hobbies or any sort of enjoyment in my life. I literally have no idea who I even am. I feel like I have lost my mind most days and want to just cry into my hands and scream, and I often do. I often contemplate just ending life but could never do that to my family that luckily still loves me very much. 

 So this is where I am and I hate it but have absolutely no idea how to remedy the situation. I feel like I'm still a teenager and everyone around me grew up while I refused. Obviously staying away from substances is a must for me but what's next? How do I move on? It's been months and I have almost no progress. I'm just lost and would appreciate any insight oe advice. I know others have been in a similar place. Thank you for reading if you have made it this far.",1453172302.0

I can understand if he was homeless but he has a steady job and all that. I should mention these come clean,  straight from the pharmacy.

Finally, he gets me back (fucking prick, that's another story). So I go to do a little test shot.

Can someone help me find out what's going on with my dope? The powder is white and burns in the nostrils. When I shoot, the dissociative feeling takes over followed by the cool mellow of the dope. I can send pictures of what my spoon looks like too

But he assured me he'd reup within the hour . So he got on the phone with his guy who I know really well and they both had a massive argument as the guy let's say ""Billy"" was saying ""Sid"" owed him £910 which was a complete lie as he only owed him about £150 . Billy is in quite a lot of debt to some nasty ppl from Glasgow so I think he's trying to get as much cash as possible . He had the nerve to say to Sid to drop of the money to a third party and he wouldn't have anything till tomorrow and this stuff was more expensive as it was stronger than the average dope he's been selling at retail prices £700 an Oz where it should be about £500/550 . So obviously Sid was enraged at this . He told him if he wanted to see the money he'd have to come get it himself . Sid asked me if I wanted to stay a couple of hours and he'd square me up with a half G from another dealer . Which he did and I got him one as well as he'd missed his done 2 days in a row .
      Once I got back billy and another guy showed up at the door and started shouting a threading Sid at the door . Billy told him to shut his fucking mouth as his neighbours in the close could hear him and n that he hooked him a topper ! Clean on the chin and he folded like a deck chair !!haha took him about 20 seconds to regain consciousness and Billy proceeded to start electrocuting him with a knuckle duster stun gun ! Haha he was dancing the funky chicken on the close floor and got stamped on the head a couple of times . His buddy/back up bolted down the stairs like the flash ! 
   I had to stop Sid from hurting Billy any more as he'd had enough and if he'd went further he'd have to go to the hospital and might have stuck him in and a stun gun in the uk is classified the same as a a real gun for some reason . Ended up staying at his bit and he bought me a bag in the morning for backing him up even though he didn't really need it . He phoned Billy up and magically admitted that his tick list was more than likely wrong and was about £150/200 and Sid  replyed you'll get it when I feel like paying you . 
    So I phoned him an hour or so ago and asked if he was back up and running and if he could give me tick till Wednesday which he said was no problem at all but I managed to get some cash before I headed into town so didn't need the sub . He told me he had a new source that was much cheaper (£550 Oz) and a lot better stuff which it defenetly is and be got a really good nod on plus I took 6 yellows (5mg Valium) early in the afternoon so that probably helped though there was a good 6 hours inbetween .
        Hope everyone is good and not suffering if they aren't wamting come off .

**Update**
 
So after further testing and review they are most definitely fake. I'm posting a pic below so folks can be careful. Notice the stamp has the correct font for the A as it has the straight sides and most fakes have angled sides /\ for the A. My fried that bought them just did a Google image search and saw them come up with pics of real Actavis 30s. Rookie. Be careful out there all, while no adverse side effects or reactions were suffered the next person may not be so lucky. These were found in the Little Rock, Arkansas area but from what I'm told and suspect they originated in Canada.

I would like to follow up on some posts I made a couple weeks ago about a battle getting a generic Opana ER filled at the largest pharmacy chain in the US among several others. 

I went to the doctor and dropped off my prescriptions on 12/20 which is a two part protocol medical treatment, opana ir & opana er (must be taken together), Walgreens fumbled around with both and manged to get the opana ir part of the prescriptions, then after a week I picked up the opana er RX from them to try and find it at another pharmacy trying to be in compliance with my doctor's orders of which I failed miserably here is why.

At first it looked like Walgreens may have did some monkey business with the opana er RX but as I found the primary drug wholesaler who all the pharmacies order their medications from was out and couldn't get any generic opana er, a friend I grew up with who is a 3rd generation pharmacist, Bill owns a large independent pharmacy here in my city and helped me and elaborated to my doomed mission, pharmacists are trained to make-every-effort to order medications for patients with lawful prescriptions, that means if the RX can't be ordered through normal wholesalers pharmacists have legal discretion to order directly from the drug manufacturer using their DEA/License#, but as Bill explained ordering directly which he does has almost put him out of business due to flak from the [DEA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_Enforcement_Administration) (US Drug Enforcement Administration), which is an acency/animal created from America's war on drugs.

As it seems getting a generic opana is going to be next to impossible based on some federal court litigation back in [Aug.](http://www.fiercepharma.com/story/endo-scores-victory-opana-er-generics-patent-battle/2015-08-17) Endo Health Solutions who owns the patents on opana won in federal court has made it impossible for drug wholesalers to get a generic opana er, so much for crushable opana er.

Bill is one of the few pharmacists that stills orders directly to drug manufacturers well he was as of last year, if you order outside the drug wholesaler you will get special visits from the DEA who last year seized all of Bill's opiates for many months for doing so        [PATIENTS DENIED MEDICATION](http://www.firstcoastnews.com/story/news/health/2015/05/05/prescription-for-pain-patients-denied-medication/26907611/) , so it looks like I'm back to the name-brand this month hurra! for TimerX.

It is next to impossible to find Roxicodone/Oxycodone or any type of crushable type pain med here in Florida and across the US, many state's have mandated pharmacies to do ""pill counts' which cripples that state from prescribing any volume of opaites to patients, and doctors are terrified of prescribing any potentially lethal dose of opiates making it very frustrating to chronic pain patents, that and many states law makers have stopped the expansion of medicaid which in itself is killing millions every year in the US, it's no wonder people turn to street drugs to self medicate, good luck everybody.

   Just a little background, it was around 9:30 now and I wanted to wait a little bit to walk into the house because the lights were probably still on and I looked high as fuck. So naturally I thought I'd just get a little higher, I forgot to include that I ate a strong ass edible before leaving to go score also. I also wanted to smoke a few more cigarettes before getting home because my mom isn't cool with me smoking heroin or cigarettes. Tough shit. So anyways this edible is starting to kick in and I have now gone through probably 3/4 of a gram of tar in just under two hours. Here's where things get interesting, I had begun nodding, but on my last nod I was awoken by an extremely bright light. Oh shit. 
           
    I could kinda remember subconsciously hearing voices while nodding but obviously I couldn't really do anything about it. So this cop keeps his bright ass light on my face and calls for backup. Fuck me. However he stayed in the car for the majority of the 5 minutes it took for the sheriff to arrive, so I had some time to discreetly rifle through all the places where I could have drugs and paraphernalia in an attempt to hide them as best as I could. I hid some stuff in the glove compartment and some in little hiding spots in the pockets of my jacket and the trash in my car. So the first cop got out of the car about a minute before his buddy arrives and starts asking me the typical set of questions, I tell the same story to the sheriff when he arrives as well. ""I had a long day at work (manual labor) and I came home and took a nap and woke up this evening and ran to the bank to deposit the money I had made. I stopped a few blocks from my house because I got a phone call from a friend that I was supposed to meet with that night and we talked for 10 minutes and I cancelled our plans, I claimed that I must have dozed off after the phone call while listening to sports on the radio.""
               
      They didn't really believe me so they wanted to check and make sure that I actually lived in the neighborhood because it is a nice neighborhood, so the first cop takes down my address and my mom's name and goes to speak with her. Fuck. The sheriff asks me a bunch of questions, seriously doubting my story about the phone call and questioning why I would park a few streets down from my house and insisting that I drank or smoked. So we talk for about ten minutes and he gives me the eye sobriety test where you follow the finger without moving your head. He checks with the other cop who confirms that I did indeed live where I said I did and the sheriff says I want you to drive straight home and I'm not gomna search you or anything. So he follows me two blocks home and I have never been luckier in my entire life. My eyes were red as the Devil's dick and apparently the cop who was shining the light sat there for like 5 minutes before I woke up, and he may have even knocked on my window. I feel like such an unbelievably lucky idiot. Fortunately I haven't been arrested and have no record and they seemed to respond positively to that as well.

My dboy got pulled over himself and luckily only had 2 bags on him so they just let him go. Which is odd cause a lot of times he has a cardboard box full of bundles like 15-20 ID say on him cause he deals more on the heavy side. Ive know him for over a year so thats why he probably even opened the box in front of me normally he has it all ready to go in his hands and idk where it comes from or if hes out I have to meet him at his crib and wait for him to run in sometimes bag it witch takes forever. but hes the best d boy in the world. IM going to write a post on here soon about how great he is to me seriously always fire dope and always on time welll.... mostly on time I normally do wait but never more than 10 min witch is pretty good in this game.

I haven't been physically strung out in about a year and a half, but last night i had crazy fucking dope dreams for the first time in a while. 
My friend and i were hanging out and she had had left to go do something. I looked over and there was a bundle and a half of ECP and 2 grams of tar, plus a paper fold with maybe 3 points raw on it. I knew i had these wicked ridiculous huge long needles in my bag but i couldn't escape my boyfriend (I'm single but in my dream i had a boyfriend who i had to sneak around on) in order to go shoot up in the bathroom. 

So i decided to stash the drugs until i could use them. So i emptied the fold into the cooker and put it on my bedside table, and slid the bundles under a loose floorboard (?) but i left the tar on the bed. So I'm laying on the bed and my nonexistent boyfriend comes in saying ""what is this?"" and I'm freaking out trying to scrape the melted tar out of the sheets, which is impossible. 

So i go to grab the cooker with the raw in it to take to the bathroom and my friend comes in and sees me with something in my hand, and starts giving me shit, saying ""what's in your hand, you're getting high, aren't you?"" and I'm trying to get away but she's grabbing at me and the cooker spills. 

So she runs off to get my sister to tell on me and i remember the rest of the bags under the floorboard. I grab those and my rigs and slam into the bathroom and lock the door. I mix that shit up real quick and am trying to hit but now my sister is at the door and breaking it down before i can hit, and all the bags are out and my needle is there and she confiscates everything and i wake up.

The Selfless Addict

There once was a boy who gave without thought

It was how he was raised and what he was taught.

Some will say he grew up way too fast

For the once selfless boy this never would last.

He would try brand new things no matter the threat

All the things he had learned he would surely forget.

For this thing came along that would change his perspective

His life would now have only one main objective.

This once selfless boy now would lie, cheat, and steal

All for this one thing so he wouldn't have to feel.

Now this boy has become a man of his very own making

Without his selflessness, the world was his for the taking.

Like an endless cycle his life would become

Always looking for that thing to make him feel numb.

This boy turned a man was lost, trapped, and hooked

By almost everyone who knew him, he would be overlooked.

His only companion was his own worst enemy

Disguised as his friend it tricked him chemically.

Until the day he can be strong and say goodbye

He will constantly hear his poor mother cry.

It really is a sad story that this boy had picked

Because there is no such thing as a selfless addict.",1453240709.0

Tomorrow.,"Hey guys. Long story short i've been using opiates for like 8 years now, but ""only"" been addicted for coming up on 3 years aka when I started shooting H.

Dads known for 6 months. Tried the whole sub doctor route, didn't work for me. Doesn't help that my insurance changed right as I was about to be going to classes and counseling and whatnot at his clinic, then boom i'm not covered, sorry.

Couldn't take it or hide it any more so I told my mom over Christmas break. Really didn't want to because i'm an only child and she already worries too much about me, but I was acting too different I guess. And this was the first winter break I came home and was broke/not making much money, its easy to hide a heroin addiction when you always have money for dope/needles/gas/saying you're doing other stuff lol

Anyway, i'm gonna check in tomorrow...well Today(Thursday), probably after dinner. I don't know what to expect. First is in patient detox, which is 3-5 days. It's non-narcotic, so no dones or sub sadly but they give us other stuff im assuming Clonadine and maybe something else? Anyone have an educated guess as to what? During this time I see a ""case worker"" to help me figure out what to do after I guess...I think right now I need in patient rehab. Even while using Suboxone I had cravings and ultimately kept using/bouncing between the two. 

What will I be doing during detox itself? I assume they have activities or classes or something?

So, anything I should/need to know about inpatient detox? What about inpatient rehab?
Anyone know how liberal/conservative these places are usually with the meds that help with w/d's? not trying to get high or anything but if it turns out if they hardly give you shit I'm just gonna go home, taper over 4 days with sub then use clonadine as needed, sleeping pills if needed at all, then check into the ""rehab"" part after, would do the same thing but i'd be more comfy and more freedom....which sadly means more chance for me to hit up a dealer. But i'd be under strict watch and supervision at home too anyway.

Idk we shall see how it goes. I'm excited because I really do honestly want to and need to get clean. Its time.",1453370153.0

""If I'm ever going to hold a job, go to school, make good money and save it, and live a good life, I can't do this anymore.""

While I used kinda (probably not) intelligently, my companions did not and it will show later. I'll try to post daily, if anyone cares. I'm not gonna be sleeping much anyway haha. 

Yes I know my title is sorta ripping off the Marilyn Manson song, sue me. I'm currently on Day 3 of this, I plan on posting my journal entries that I kept/will keep on this binge. I don't know what the point of this is but its entertaining. 

Day 1: I'm off from work for a little R&R. I didn't use many vacation days last year and they expire so I'm using 11 days. I decided to visit my parents in the suburbs. My fiance is away on business for most of the month so I was bored. 

I receive a call from a girl I knew in high school. She was a ""bad"" kid, she's been doing dope way longer than I have, and I've been doing dope for nearly 10 years (4 year sober break). She needs a ride to cop. I ask if the dope is fire. She says its beyond that. She says she can get high off 3-4 bags, which with her tolerance, is ludicrous. I agree to take her in exchange for a tax of one bag and I'm of course copping myself. I haven't seen her in nearly 5 years. Last I saw her, she was doing pretty badly. But she's always been grimy, sweet and pretty , but grimy and a bad apple. 

I pick her up and she's emaciated beyond belief and high off crack. We chat and she reveals she's prostituting to support her habit. Out of her mother's house. Lovely situation. But that's this game eh? We go about 25 minutes to cop and we get some dope. And that's where the binge begins. 

She begs me to take a crack hit in the car. I refuse but she starts to cry so I give in. I'm a sucker. I say she better not touch my soft and she agrees. She takes a ""big fat hit"" and can't speak. Crackheads suck. She kinda lays there twitching and being tweeked and trying to speak the whole way home. It was discomforting. But whatever. We get home and I immediately prepare the rig and find a vein in my elbow crook on the first try. Score. Shoot up and I'm transported to a world of awesomeness. I snort a ton of coke because I'm an idiot and I'm having a fucking ball. 

I always felt me and her were like Bonnie and Clyde, If Bonnie was a crackwhore junkie who looks like one and Clyde is someone who'd you never guess has ever smoked pot. We are certainly an odd couple. But there's something comforting about copping and using with her. She's good company. She tells crazy stories and is pretty generous when I'm sick. 

Me and Bonnie decide to take the party out of my house and since we're inebriated I call a cab. The cab driver pulls up 10 minutes later and what do we find but two crisp $100 bills on the floor. I pocket them quietly. We get to Bill's house and the party continues. We had to have shot a bun of dope each in like 12 hours and did a teener of coke (but not a fake teener like a little more than 1.75 on my scale), We were bombed. She had meth but I don't fuck with that. 

All of a sudden this guy comes to cop for Bill. Bill is a former co-worker, loves his coke and made his money by the time he was 40 and got out. He deals expensive, pure drugs to suburban moms and Wall Street dads. But this isn't his typical client. He's a bit scary looking and ragged. He drops 2 stacks (approx $2,000) on the table and Bill gives him about 2 oz of blow. I later found out that this guy is a former cartel runner who got fucked out of his job and is doing the same hustle as Bill but in the Eastern suburbs. I said to Bill that we should blow the fucking money on a ""Fear and Loathing""-esque cache of drugs. 

He asks me what I was thinking. I said as much dope, coke, crack (for Bonnie), pills, speed and ketamine we can get. He asks how much I'll put in. I said I'd put in 2g's. He said ok, lets do it. We spent the night doing the rest of our stash and having a ball but Day 2 is when the insanity begins...",1453358280.0

Basically binge work week an then withdraw on the weekend, as soon as I'm well do more.  I think I'm on a 2 week binge (aka I didn't withdraw the last weekend, so actually a week and a bit.

I've been having crazy vivid dreams lately, overall neutral I'd say some good some bad. 

I had my first hallucination in the early hours of the morning, my boss from work was on a stair case in the right corner of my room (I didnt realize it was my room at the time). He tells me his son just attempted suicide.  I was like I didn't know you had a son, and  we chat for a bit, tells me he has a 15 year old son.  Then I ask him a question and he stops talking.  After no response after me talking to him (I was literally talking in my room). I think hes just broken down  and get up to pat his shoulder.  Its then that it hits my I'm in my bed in my PJs, the staircase is in my room and my boss is a hallucination.  I snapped back to reality after that.

Hallucination number 2 is much simpler.  I'm on the toilet trying to take a dump and I'm looking through my shorts/boxers and the shorts around my ankles are waving exactly an acid/shroom trip.  A  few other things in the bathroom moved but not nearly as intensely as the shorts.

Hallucination #3 which just happened.  I'm going for a smoke I'm exiting through the carport door like always. I'm about at the door (just gotta go round the corner) and I hear a short brief intense knock.  I think what the fuck? I debate for a minute if to go outside.  I decide yes, as soon as I get outside I light my smoke and scan the area. It took me a while to notice a person in the back seat of my car, they are moving their hands but it doesn't make sense/I cant make it out.  I intensely stare at this person for I dont know how long, enough let them know I know.  At this point I'm debating either approaching the car or going inside and getting my box cutter.  After some more intense staring at the person doing the thing with their hands that I cant make out I think its my buddy fucking with me. I powerwalk up to the back seat of my jetta and its like the back post of my car.

I go into my room and write this. It feels like I;m swaying back and forth aswell, changing intensities.

Anyways obviously I need to get off this shit. I forgot to mention yesterday after work I switched from nasal to oral to save my fucked up nose.  I didn't take any for 3 hrs  I was thrust into terrible withdrawal, much more brutal than previous withdrawals.  My dosing has been 100-300mg every 2-3 hrs.

How can I taper off this shit? Do I need to be in withdrawals to actually lower tolerance and taper or can I be ""well"" and successfully taper?

EDIT: I should mention I am on setipiprant (a pgd2 blocker) to try and combat hairloss. Yesterday and today I took it orally instead of my normal topical route because I ran out of supplies.

   Our first issue is that I have picked up some new dope from the regular guy, and it is absolutely firrrrrrrrrrrrre. Compared to the stuff he normally was given me... I get fucked off a bag of this, normally it would take me 2 bags sometimes more. These bags are about 1/3 gram, commonly refereed to as ""forty bags"" or ""forties"" because most people sell them for $40 I guess.  (These are really 30 bags though as they have 0.3 whereas a 40 bag should be a 0.4, plus I pay $30, but don't go telling every1 that)

   So yeah, these bags get me insanely fucked up, and the high lasts FOREVER. This is really good shit, must be a lot more pure than normal. Having said all this, I hate the initial rush. The pins and needles hit really hard and it fucking hurts and there is no way to make it stop for like 20 seconds and then the effect will finally wear off. I think the biggest problem is that I have hemorrhoids from being constipated and straining (guys, take stool softeners and laxatives and eat lots of fibers. It is required to soften your stool because shitting bricks really destroys your anus!!) and I can really feel the dope flowing through the blood vessels down there. The worst places are in my feet and hands as well. 

   So is this just the high quality dope giving me the pins and needles feeling that people normally like? It's not some cut they are using? I literally  will scream in agony from this if there is nobody around. My solution so far is smaller shots but ... meh

Then Monday around 10 pm (23 hours later)  I took 60 mg oxy (2 30 mg pills) 
Monday's Dose: 60 mg Oxycontin at 10 pm

On Tuesday morning, 12 hours after the 60 mg of oxy,  at around 10 am I dosed 3 mg xanax to get through a stress full work day (10 am Tuesday)...afterwards, I got home and dosed 8 mg xanax again 8 hours later (6pm Tuesday)
Tuesday's Dose : 11 mg Xanax  

And finally this morning, on Wednesday at 11 am, I took my one one last bar at work for yet another stressful day
Wednesday's dose: 2mg Xanax 

So my questions ( which I would love to have answered in order and in depth as possible) are as follows

1) is it safe to take oxy today around 10 pm after 11 hours of taking xanax? as in it safe to take my remaining 60 mg dose of oxy today at 10 pm? (11 hours after taking 2mg xanax, and )


2) Even if the answer is a yes, (as I've heard it is since 11 hours is more than enough time to keep them from interacting with eachother and causing my brain to shut down)- ISN'T THERE STILL A RISK regarding the accumulative/residual effects of the oxy's and xanax's I took the prior 3-4 days that would make it more dangerous? Or is it safe as long as I dont take it together

3) ..would the 60 mg of oxy give me a pleasurable euphoric effect like it did 48 hrs ago, or would it be completely worthless and worth doing a week tolerance break?  (I do have some 5 mg percocets I can throw in and make it just a bit more potent maybe that'll work...So should I just give it some time and wait till friday? (I'd like to avoid that since i got guests coming over on Friday, wouldn't wanna be high around them...also this is the last of my stash, and I plan to stop messing with these pharmaceuticals and start living a different life...it's been a fun two months, but I do wanna go out with a BANG! ) 

4) Lastly, and most importantly, I am well aware that combining a benzo and opiate is very dangerous an can result in death....however I have came to believe taking these mini breaks between each dose from has rendered it safe(r)....am I making a correct assumption here or are there residual effects from taking this many mg's of each that can backfire on me and still put me at risk ?

Anyhow, I'd MUCH appreciate any fellow redditor to thoroughly answer these questions in order...much thanks

I will be able to cop in the morning and I really hope I don't. 

Has anybody ever feel like knowing you have subs on hand really fucks with kicking? I know if (and when) I slip up I won't get deathly sick, which makes slipping up feel like NBD. I've been on the fence for months now going back and forth between h and subs, I NEED to quit to get my shit together for this semester. I go to one of the top 5 unis in the country I can't afford to fuck up anymore. But I hate how I keep on thinking I can get high and jump right back on subs. Ugghhhhh. Also my old connect (30 8mg for $40-60) went away or got busted for burglary I think, saw his face on a flier a while back. Now they cost me way more, $20 A POP here (unbelievable!!) but luckily I got the pills not film for $5 each last time. It feels like getting high ain't cheap but kicking ain't that much better, but that's just an excuse. 

Sometimes I wish I was at a detox unit where they only dispense enough subs to kick, then I won't be sitting on these little tricksters arguing with myself about calling up the dope man. 

Right before I quit this time, the usual stamps got mad shitty too. They felt like I was inhaling brick dust and hot sauce, it was disgusting. But as soon as I got on dat lil orange pill, I get a text saying they are back at their best again.

waking up dopesick becomes a normality 

i’m still in love with this drug despite all the brutality 

a toxic relationship that’ll take me to an early grave 

no matter what it’s still all that i crave 

abandon all of my family and friends

Only thing was that I had taken 3 mg of xanax 11 hours before I planned on doing oxy, and around 11 mg xanax in total 20 hours before.

Most users told me NOT to do it, as it would still be dangerous. I acted like an asshole to them and completely ignored them

1 am rolled around, and 12 hours after taking xanax (which I believe to be 3mg, could have been much stronger as it was pressed) I went ahead and took 60 mg of Oxycodone. And then took another 40 mg of HYDROCODONE.

Now here's where it gets spooky. I have taken big doses of those opiates like that before. I start feeling weightless, fuzzy, warm, and then eventually my eyelids get heavy. My eyes start closing and opening, and closing and opening. But I'm able to remain awake for the most part and enjoy the high.

But this time? A little time passed and I remembered thinking ""these pills aren't working, what a waste""..and that's basically all I remember. I woke up 7 hours later. Body aching, white as a ghost. Mouth dry, feeling tired and frail.  My voice was hoarse. Coworkers asked why I was cross eyed. I kept going in and out of sleep at work .

This is why I'm scared, was this basically my brain shutting down? Respiratory depression almost? How close was I to gone?

I've taken massive doses like this, sometimes 80 mg of hydro is barely felt by me...so how come instead of slowly nodding in and out and feeling  it first , this time, I just blacked out all at once..ON FUCKING OXY AND HYDRO? Was that the xanax/ opiate combo? HOURS LATER? And, as much as I don't wanna know the answer, I must ask...did I possibly cheat death?


I have a feeling I'm very lucky I woke up. Taking that much oxy would never fuck me over like that by itself ...I'm so dumb. I apologize to everyone that was trying to set me straight yesterday. Here's the whole debacle for those interested anyway

I get a gram and it comes with the usual warnings, ""Be careful, bro. It's straight fire."" I get to where I'm going and fix a tester shot (maybe a third of a point). Next thing I know, my buddy is smacking me across the face and shaking me violently. An hour had passed and I can't recall anything after pushing that plunger down.

NOTE: I'm not condoning anything posted in this. While I used kinda (probably not) intelligently, my companions did not and it will show later. I'll try to post daily, if anyone cares. I'm not gonna be sleeping much anyway haha.

We set out to get our drug collection. I was tasked with getting the dope and pills. Bonnie came with me and got enough crack to last her 4 more days of intense binging. Bill had the coke but went out to get the Speed and K. 

Bill's Cop: Bill was a rich and successful man but was not street smart. He was not used to going to cop and didn't have a good source for Speed and K so he used one of my guys. Of course, Bill doesn't realize that dropping $1,000 on the table and asking for as much Speed and K you can get is likely gonna get you ripped off. So he did this. Long story short, the guy completely tries to fuck us on the K. Bill said the guy was supposed to sell us 13 g's for 500 and tried to short him badly. So Bill threatened him with violence, which was a bad idea. The guy called in some other guys and Bill was going to get his ass beat. He texted me and I diffused the situation and we got 13 g's of pretty pure K for 500. Not a great deal but not bad. We also got a ludicrous amount of speed, I mean nearly wasteful amounts. 

DOPE AND PILLS: I currently have a large amount of shit in my house. Its really crazy. I want to post dope porn but Bonnie and Bill say even if I remove EXIF data it still leaves me vulnerable. Copping was pretty easy to be honest, I've had these relationships for a while. 

I drove into the city to do this because I trust the people more. The a haul: 

Two and a Half Bricks of Dope: 125 Stamps. 100 with no stamp on them, 25 stamped RUSH which is a hella good stamp in my area. I paid $650, which is a phenomenal deal here, that's slightly more than $5 bags that I'm 100% are not Fent cut and are among the most fire I've gotten. 

Pharms: I'm not a huge pill guy but I got 20 8mg Dilaudid's with 3 8mg Suboxone thrown in for $300. I also got 10 40mg Opana (oxymorphone) but I can't remember how much if anything I paid for it because the guy who I got it off of owed me money. 

THE USE: I started off my doing a bump of coke to wake up and then I did a test shot of the dope. It was hella good. I did a small amount and was buzzing hard. I did a little more blow and was in heaven. Sometimes when I fake speedball I start to feel all powerful and like become a douchebag. This was no different. I started being an ass to Bonnie and she came back at me. 

She was in full crack binge mode. She was cracking pipes all over the place but in her bag, there seemed to be a never-ending supply of pipes. It was mad funny because the crack was hella good so she wouldn't be able to talk for like 25 minutes after taking a hit. Crack is a dirty fucking drug. She started talking about bringing clients ove rto make some extra money and I yelled at her and said that she's got all the drugs in the universe, food to eat, a place to sleep, she's not working. So she agreed. 

Bill brought out some Benzos he had hanging around. WHAT I DID IS VERY DANGEROUS AND STUPID. I put 2 Xanax under my tongue and I was flying. I'm surprised I kept it together for as long as I did. I go black for a bit after the Xanax. Approx. 3-5 hours. 

Coming to, we continue re-dosing and playing but not with Benzos. Bonnie begins to use dope. She's having trouble finding veins so I shoot her up a couple of times. She's irritable about her vein issues but whatever, I've had a hot hand and have been able to hit her pretty quickly. 

All three of us kinda nod but not really. We're there, we're just in such a state of euphoria that its just... overwhelming. We haven't even touched the K yet because we wanted to do more research on how it plays with dope and coke and whatever. I decide to get up and get some water. I notice Bonnie isn't looking too good. I go over and her breathing is very soft, she feels cold but she's not OD'd yet. Definetly not. I debate Narcaning her but I realize that if she's just really fucked up and went over slightly, she'd kill me. I decide to wait and see. 

3 hours later Bonnie breaks out of catatonic state. Thank god. I tell her she needs to chill for the rest of the night. She agrees and goes upstairs to go to sleep. 

Bill and I decide to have some fun. As the clock approaches midnight we decide to do something I haven't done in a long long time. Bill has darknet Psilocybin mushroom in liquid form. It tasted like alcohol mixed with carrots and throw up, but I got it down. He said it would be less intense because of the Xanax I took nearly 12 hours earlier. If that was less intense, I don't know what regular would be like.

I tripped for a solid 6 hours. I saw Jesus and Buddha. I laughed a lot. I talked to them and they said nothing of interest. They were cool though. I enjoyed playing with my reflection in the mirror too. At around 6 am, my trip abruptly stopped and I crashed hard. I passed out on the couch. Day 3 would be coming soon, and Day 3 was going to be quite the upper, so I had to get my sleep.  ",1453415589.0

I moved out of the country and only today found a connect for methadone (it is called Heptanon here), they have both 5mg powder pills and 10ml liquid which they said is equivalent to 20 of the pills.

My syringes say ""1ml/cc"" and have 100 units. 

I just dissolved 3 of the 5mg pills in about 1.5 syringe fulls of water. It took like 5 cottons to get it all back into the syringe and a lot of gunk was left behind. It was still cloudy so I filtered it one more time and it came out clear.

I did actually feel a rush but it was almost a tease because it didn't go ""all the way"" and only after about 20 minutes (as i write this) do I feel a bit calmer and my eyes are drowsy.

I know I shouldn't have expected anything like slamming half a bundle feels, but I thought the effects would at least get me high enough that after all the anticipation and anxiety of possibly getting a rush are not met that I would at least be totally relaxed.

As of right now I almost want to try to slam the 2 more 5mg pills I have in about an hour but everything I read online is so varying saying that the peak could possibly be in 4 hours and that taking more because I don't feel enough right away can put me at risk.

I am going to get the liquid later and am wondering given my experience with the pills, how should I prepare it for IV and how much should I use? Do I have to wait like 6 hours before dosing again? When can I take my suboxone again?

Sorry for so many questions but if anyone can contribute anything to this topic then let me know here!

Then by this time half an hour had past and I went back to her door and got my 0.2 g and got the bus back home . 
   The two powders are a different shade of brown to one another but the heroin is about the same strength and I just mixed them together . A new couple of batches are going around the area that is stronger than the stuff that's been going around the last couple of months you get a nice rush and nod from it ,though it doesn't have the legs of the old stuff .

I was nervous about coming off subs and found extremely mixed/conflicting stories on this topic leading up to my detox. If I'm posting this in the wrong place, let me know**

Basic Background Info: I used opiates for about 5 years, from about 16-21. Pretty typical story, started with weed and beer, graduated to pain killers, used roxy's for about 4 years and then eventually turned to insulating heroin for a year. At the height of my use I used about 10-15 bags a day (not a lot in comparison to most heroin users). Decided to get clean, enlisted in an IOP and found a sub doctor. I took suboxone/nalaxone for nearly a year and a half. The doc ramped me up to 10mgs a day, which I thought was unnecessary but that's how it played out, and then I weaned down to 2mgs over the course of that 1.5 years. I detoxed off the subs over a month ago, and overall, this is what I would tell anyone else who is thinking about coming off/prepping for a detox (Strictly my personal opinion):

1. If you wean down to about 1-2mgs (like myself), it will be NOWHERE NEAR AS BAD as fast-acting opiate withdrawal. The sub detox was a cake-walk in comparison to being dope sick.
2. The bulk of the withdrawal symptoms I experienced was insomnia, restless legs at night, sweating and some mild anxiety (nothing surprising)
3. The worst and most intense withdrawal symptom was lethargy - I had extremely little energy for about a week and a half and the lack of appetite didn't help this.
4. I was on college break from school when I detoxed, effectively giving me a month of laying on a couch, this helped (to a certain extent) and I would recommend coming off subs at a time where you don't have much going on.
5. That being said, after about the first week I started going a little stir crazy and I think having distractions will definitely help you (playing an instrument, reading, tons of movies, jerking off, etc.) If you have the strength to exercise then do it, it will help.
6. I was given a non-narcotic anti anxiety med by my doc, this also help me.
7. MAINTAIN A POSITIVE FRAME OF MIND - If you really want to stay clean, you can get off the subs. I've seen a lot of discouraging comments online telling people who are worried about sub detoxes, ""You're probably going to go back to using anyway, just take the subs"" and things of that nature. That's bullshit. You can do it if you are determined.

Depending on what train of thought you employ, I've been clean for 1.7 years - 1.5 of those years I was on Suboxone. My doctor recommended Vivitrol but I decided not to go with it (I wanted to see if I could face addiction without any more drugs), however, I think this is also a good option if you're scared (fear is nothing to be ashamed of, means you're thinking logically).

Anyway, I don't know if this helps anyone at all but I just thought I would post. If anyone has any questions, I'd be more than happy to answer!  ",1453392784.0

I know I recognize almost every regular poster and many semi-regulars and am familiar with their story, so if any in the r/opiate family cares to read this blog update shitpost to the story of my life that's pretty cool and I got mad love for all of you.

I got hit by a car at the end of May and almost died.  They put a plate in my neck to stop me from being paralyzed and I have a rod going through my left femur holding it together.  I had been clean off opiates since going to jail the week before Christmas 2014, and I had been out since March doing pretty well for myself.  Well getting hit put a pretty abrupt stop to my personal development and put me in a lot of pain.  They had me on fucking norcos not eben a week after it happened and I was still in the hospital, and within a month they had me down to two norco 10s a day (while I was still using a walker and neckbrace and could barely move.)  Needless to say I was in a lot of pain and I kinda fell back into using H just to be able to walk.

From July to December my use steadily increased as I regained mobility and started back to work.  By Thanksgiving I was using every day and my close friends ive known for years (my boy since high school and his wife) that manage the place I work had noticed I had relapsed and called me out on it.  They took me off the schedule the week before Christmas and told me to get my shit together, so I went to go stay out at my mommas in the middle of the country to clean up.  I haven't totally kicked yet, but I've gone from using every day to using once a week, which is a vast improvement.

Today was a very eventful day for me.  I got tested for HIV, Hep C, and other standard STDs at the clinic to make sure my dumbass didnt pick up any fucked up shit on this last go round.  After leaving the clinic I went to the gas station to get a pack of cigs and my friends who run my store happened to be there.  I had just talked to them a couple days ago and told them I was doing a lot better and been out there looking for a job again.  Well I happened to ask them if I could go back on the schedule and my homegirl who is the GM of the store told me she'd call me later.  This afternoon she called me back and asked if I could come in tomorrow because theyre super short staffed and im really good at my job when im not all fucked up and I was like yeah, for sure.  I gave to go in under a probationary period where if i miss or am late ill get fired,and she told me if she knows im using again its over.  She's a former heroin junkie thats managed to turn her life around.  She's done some prison tome and almost died of an overdose but in the last couple years she's managed to pull a 180 and is doing really well for herself (as an aside im super proud of her and her husband, theyre two of my closest friends and theyve both been to prison and had their lives in shambles but are clean and doing awesome and it makes me so happy to see my people coming up from the shit we been through.)  But she said I cant fool her about being on shit, which she's right about, and that its for both our best interest that if im using i shouldnt be working there, which she is also right about.  She brought up the point that she could relapse at any time, such is the nature of addiction, and that bringing the shit into her store not only threatens her job but her sobriety.  That shit is real talk, and I can and will respect that.

So between getting tested for Hep and getting my job back and not wanting to jepordize the results of either of those I think its time to hang up my rig and put away my spoon.  In addition to all that I'm about to finish up probation, I'm hopefully about to start training for a better full time position that ill need to pass drug screens for, and I've been talking to my maybe baby mama and want to possibly move my relationship with her forward with her and figure out if I am the father of her cnild or not.  All that is put into a precarious position by my using.  My life got put on hold very suddenly and very violently, but now its coming at me all at once, just like the car that almost broke me.  But I'm ready for this impact.  I'm ready to meet this rushing force head on. 

 I feel good about myself and where I'm at, much like I did when I got out of jail this last time. My life is a mess and most would say I have nothing but debt and a criminal record to my name, but that's not true.  I have my life and I have my freedom.  Having come close to almost losing both, I've learned to appreciate the basics of existing in this world.  I've made many mistakes in the past, but I still have time to fix things.  I still draw breath in the free world.  I wanna do right by my family and my true friends that have been there for me through the past fucked up decade of my life and longer.  I wanna do right by the people I have known and loved that are not with us anymore.  I wanna do right out of respect for the ones who were taken before their time and my homies doing years and decades behind bars, because it could have easily been me in any one of those graves or locked up in any one of those cells.  I'm fucking ready for this shit.  I've been doing wrong for the past 29 years.  I've done the wrong things enough that I know with certainty what the right things are, and its time to start doing them.

Thanks to anyone who actually read this bullshit for letting me share.  This place has quickly started to feel like an extended part of my circle to me. I've got solidarity and warm embraces for all of yall that are down in the muck with me, I've got the utmost respect for everyone who's managed to climb out of their own graves and turned their lives around.  I've got hope for all of you who are rising to your feet alongside myself and starting the crawl back up out of the mire, and I've got prayers for all the ones dipping their toes into this fucking swamp, playing carelessly on the edge of a mountain not realizing how far the fucking fall can be and that not everyone makes it out of this shit alive.  I hope everyone can make it out of this game alive, but I know that's not going to happen, that's not reality, and I've got tears of sorrow for all the ones who won't.  But right now each and every one of us is alive.  Let's make the most ofnit fam.  And i know the best way for me to make the most of it is to not be shoving needles in my arms.

Anyway the weird thing is he told me he prefers Venmo payments. For those of you who don't know, Venmo is a 3rd party, kinda of Paypal/Chase Quickpay thing where you send money instantly between your bank account/debit card and another account/debit card. I have a ""drug"" bank account that I use to hide transactions from my significant other and since Venmo is Facebook based, I have made an essentially blank profile and added the dealer on there as well as added about 150 acquaintances and other fake profiles that just accepted my request. 

Questions: 
1. How much of a risk is this? Obviously I had to use my SS # and my real name to open the account. It would be easily traced back to me. But in reality, do you think its any riskier than any other method of payment? 
2. Would you do this? Just a random sampling, but I'm waffling back and forth between doing this. It could be ultra convenient but it could also be a real risk.

429ss3,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/429ss3/psa_for_all_the_snorters_and_chocolate_milk/,29,https://redd.it/429ss3,Just_BANG_that_shit,PSA: For all the snorters and chocolate milk lovers out there (or anyone else or no one at all):,"Do you hate it when a cut straw is too sharp and slices up your nose? Are tired of using straws that are too wide or too narrow for your preference? Do you feel the need to hide your drug straw from friends and family because you had to cut one up which looks suspicious? Do you like chocolate milk? 

If you answered yes, maybe or no to none, any or all of the questions above - I have the perfect solution for you! 

Through extensive research and and no development, I've discovered the most ideal snorting tube. The best part is that it can be found at your nearest chocolate milk grocer! 

For the low-ish price of $1.29 you can buy an individual Horizon Brand Organic Chocolate (or white milk if you're racist) milk box. The box comes with its very own straw which will be attached to rither the north or west side of the box. You might be thinking, ""what's so special about this straw, just_bang_that_shit""? Well r/opiates, I'll tell you why!

1) Comes with chocolate milk (or chocolate milk comes with the straw if you're that kind of person).
2) The straw is really two straws which can be used together or separately giving you freedom to choose length and width. 
3) the main (white) straw is tapered with a smooth, rounded end giving you comfort and convenience!
7) the tapered end allows you to easily identify which side of the straw goes in your nose - avoiding a potentially mildly inconvenient dilemma known as the ""double booger end conundrum"".
4) The white straw is the perfect length and width for 87% of snorters!
5) Durability - the white straw isn't flimsy but justttt right. Like mama bear's bed. 
6) it comes with chocolate milk! 

Happy snorting!

PS - no joke, best straw ever. Did I mention it comes with choco milk? Picture in comments.

Since we're both taking lope can you also take a sub to help with the residual wds or will that send you into precipitated wds? Or will you get wds period? I don't know much about lope so I haven't a clue!

* What's the dosage (for top quality dnm opium)? I know the general rule of thumb is the size of a match head, but what's that in mg?

* What alkaloids are you getting a buzz from? Just morphine and codeine? If codeine, should I have dph on hand to kill itching?

* How long does it last?

* Can you nod from just smoking opium?

* What other opiate would you compare it to, as far as smoking it goes? What does it compare to orally?

* How does oral opium compare to smoked?

* What's it mix well with? Weed is an obvious answer, and if you have experience with the combo i'd like to hear, but what else is it good with?

I would normally just use google, but the only thing I've got from that are 'the size of a matchhead' dose and really not much else other than how well it synergizes with weed.

Opium really interests me. I love how you can straight up rip a bong with it, and how fast it comes on. I've had better opiates, but opium looks like it could potentially be my favourite. I just wanna know if it's worth it first.

What's the worst time you lost your dope.,"so every since i found this subreddit I've been creeping, maybe posting a comment here and there, but I was clean when I was doing it. I always thought ""Man! I wish I had this while I was using."" Well, now I do. So I wanted to ask what is your situation where you freaked out and lost, missed, or really whatever with your dope in which afterwords it was like the sky was falling. Mine was when I was doing about a few balloons a day about 3-5 years ago, and I was really sick and only had one balloon left and one balloon made out in the spoon. My dealer wasn't picking up (and wouldn't for the next 5 hours) and I really needed this shot. So I'm in my car about to open this balloon and it drops in between my drivers seat and the center console. I get out of the car to then see the spoon I had set on the center console slide off and SPILL ALL THAT DOPE! I freak out of course and try to save what's left...which was nothing and there was dirt, grim, and little bits of fuzz on it. So i go check underneath the seat and look for the balloon now frantically, but somehow it's not there...I start tearing my car apart cause it's a little messy...look for about an hour and it's not their. I do remember also that in the middle of this I had to move parking spots in the middle of searching because I believe people were getting suspicious. So I assumed some how....don't know how, that I dropped it outside the car. I go look back at the original parking and it's not their. Eventually, a friend I call helps me out and I pay her back when I scored. I never forgot about it and would occasionally look for it every once in awhile. Anyways 2 years later I end up finding it! I find it cause as the ware and tear of my car keeps going a rip where me seat is attached to the car gets bigger. I look in it and start pulling it back. Bam! There it is somehow lodged way in there. Like a million to one shot it land in that groove and a million in one chance it gets pushed in there. I believe when I pushed the seat up it pushed the dope into it further. I was semi clean at the time so of course I end up doing it. It was a bittersweet moment I can somewhat laugh about now, and the shot was bittersweet too. Thanks hopefully I get back off of this but looks like I'll be needed to go back to rehab, methadone clinic, or suboxone again. Hope all is well! Thanks for listening.  ",1453486072.0

Basically, I've been extremely conservative with my gear since Thursday, as I don't get paid again till late monday, at midnight, where I will be getting my fortnightly payment, and will have plenty to spend again. Till then my aim has just been to use enough to get by without getting sick, and I was technically broke back on Thursday, so I've had to really pull out all the stops to hustle up the money for every single bag I've bought since then. 

I'll try not to bore you with the details, but basically, I got pretty lucky yesterday. My bank resolved a complaint I had by generously offering what at first I thought was a £25 payment ($35 for you yanks), and that got me one very very good £15 bag, and off another guy I got what turned out to be a kinda small £10 bag. I called my bank about something unrelated yesterday, and was informed by the adviser that I actually misunderstood, and to my delight, was informed I'd actually be paid an additional payment of £25 within 24 hours. I wake up today and still have the £10 bag left, and being conservative as I didn't know exactly when the 24 hour ""countdown"" began, I did a very small shot - like just under 1/3 of the bag - to just about get me by when I woke up this morning. I look at my account balance a few hours later, and fucking whoop-de-doo, no second payment. I call the bank, and am told after waiting for fucking half an hour, that they don't know whats happened, and can't see any evidence that I was ever offered the second £25, that this adviser fucking ASSURED me that I'd be getting (I confirmed it multiple times with her and was told it was definite), and that they'd have to listen back to the ball and ""investigate"" what she told me, which for some fucking reason is going to take 48 fucking hours. 

So here I am, with essentially a full 40 hours to wait till I definitely will have money for more, but I'm so fucking pissed off and aggravated about the whole situation I just say ""fuck it"" and shoot all I have left. I got a lovely rush and have a decent high going right now, but 40 long hours between now and when I get paid, and unless the bank get back to me early, which is extremely unlikely, or I get some early birthday money arrive in the post tomorrow, which is possible but by no means definite, I'm fucking screwed. All I have left is a few filters I can wash out and get a tiny little hit out of, but god damn. Don't you just fucking HATE this waiting game!? ",1453625401.0

Recently my dad was diagnosed with Prostate Cancer and even more recently a tumor above his lung.  Now, unlike myself, my dad is quite the stranger to opiates.  He was having issues even taking small doses of Hydrocodone.  

A recent hospital stay, where they discovered the tumor, well he figured out Morphine and Hydromorphone is his savior.  I was pretty happy, in a twisted way,.. that at least out of all this bullshit cancer he at least got to experience opiates at their full potential -- some happiness during the pain.  They were giving him the dilaudid via IV and my mom said his eyes were rolling back in his head.

Anyway, way off subject.  The problem he is having now is .. like most of us his body isn't agreeing with the opiates at all, ... He said he hasn't shit proper in several days (they gave him an enema on the hospital though).

I was looking up things and .. Milk of Mag (Magnesium Hydroxide) .. Epsom Salt (Magnesium Sulfate) and someone from TripSit suggested Magnesium Citrate...

So, I'm not really too keen on the subject.  I'm able to just go long enough and tolerate the pain and w/d's for a little bit and take a pretty decent BM every few days.  But his pain is obviously just on a whole different order of magtitude so not an option for him...

Apparently Magnesium makes you shit... Which one is better?

Most of the time I am on tar, though recently Ive put together a week or two at a time on subs with no tar.  None of this is particularly interesting, but the questions I have about these substances, and the nature of quitting them have yet to be adequately explained to me. My goal is to leave from SF in april, and by that time be detoxed more or less fully.  until then I'd like to not die, save a bit of more money (have some from non using days hidden away), and not blow out my veins, get an abscess, OD etc. Thing is, after week or so of using, once I start getting sick when I take a zubsolv it does not alleviate any of the symptoms/makes them worse for about 18 hours.  its not precipitated w/ds, because those would be short and excruciating correct? which this is not, just a lack of all energy, insomnia, sinus irritation, massive anxiety.  By two go its getting a bit better but it usually takes till day 3 or 4 for a decent night of sleep(dosages of approx 1 1/2 pill each day=8mg of bup in traditional subs).  this makes it hard to switch over to bupe from BTH when I need to go to work.  ive waited every amt from 12 hours to 20 from last use, so I need a new explanation b/c most sites online and most doctors had not had any ideas on the reason for these symptoms besides precipitated w/ds(which I'm pretty sure its not). 

My seconds question is with regards to trying to kick completely before leaving.  even with somewhat of a taper getting off a steady dose of zubsolv(figure one or a bit less a day) is a bit tough in a short period of time.  on the other hand kicking BTH I have done and know will not go on forever and with a camping trip benzos, clonodine and 2mg of bupe when its unbearable can be dealt with, and then hope to leave just then. 

As you probably surmised here is my conundrum, would I rather jump from .6-1g a day of BTH(not great, not horrible)/day or from say 6/mg of bupe (or two after quick taper).  yes i could go right to bupe immediately n start slowest possible taper but to be honest I dont wanna commit to not using at all going forwards. Any advice or personal experience with either the kicking or the symptoms induced by zubsolv would be greatly appreciated. Ive heard stories of starting on say 2mg of subs, shooting a bag of tar than taking more subs and the shot will take edge offf but seconds dose of bupe wont cause precipitated w/d since bupe already on there? 

Could goin onto methadone instead od subs be less jarring? not getting on full term, but as a slightly more recreational substitute that didnt ",1453599341.0

First of all, I gotta say, I totally adore this sub when I'm using. Despite what *some* other subs may say, I think this is a great place, with a real spirit of community - I always get a ""we're all in this together"" kinda vibe. Of course, when I'm going through withdrawals when I see posts pop up here I get extremely jealous, sometimes explosively angrily jealous, sometimes despairingly miserably intensely jealous, especially when pictures of people's recent cops come up on my front page. When I quit, I try to spend more time on the recovery sub, but this sub will always have a place in my heart!

Just a quick question on something I've been wondering about recently. I started IV'ing, and have been doing so on and off for a few months, and have noticed a pattern. Now, first of all, I know that this is generally bad practice, but I'm sure that all of you that indulge in injecting know what its like when you find a good, reliable vein, I tend to literally bleed them dry all the time, but am attempting to change to healthier practices.

However, that being said, I'm curious about something. I'll tend to find like 1-3 ""good"" veins - ones that are relatively easy to hit, and pretty reliable, and attempt to rotate them until they're fucked, then look for new places (eventually leading me to unfortunate times like now where I've fucked all of my spots and am looking for new ones, leaving me fucking around in frustration and anger every time I shoot up looking for a good vein or having to hit one of the ones that are in awkward spots and miss half the fucking shot - like I did just), but I've noticed that when I find a good vein, for some reason, after ""breaking it in"", it gets noticeably better. What could this be down to? This consistently happens with certain veins, the first couple times I hit it there will be a smaller area that will give that red plume of blood and that will be more difficult to find and the needle will be more likely to slip etc but it seems that after a couple of times it will be far easier to hit, I don't have to be as precise with the needle to get blood, the vein seems to ""hold"" the needle better and it is less likely to slip etc. This isn't just down to me refining the position of the needle with that little bit of practice, this is something that consistently happens with good veins, and I'm wondering what it could be down to. I thought maybe it was due to *slight* scarring of the vein before it gets so scarred I can't hit it at all, but that doesn't explain why it paradoxically gets *easier* to get the plume of blood - I always figure the vein is getting scarred when instead of getting that good plume of blood, it becomes just a little rush of blood, or at the very end, even sometimes just a small trickle.

Also, and this is after IVing on and off for two years now (I have quit more times than I can count, and after a sufficient break I always go back to chasing the dragon firstly, and either quit or say ""fuck it"" and turn the binge into a full-blown relapse by going back to IVing), I have had many, many veins die on me, but then come back, and be good to go for an equally long length of time as they were good for originally (sometimes even longer if I'm rotating them), why is this? What's the distinction between a vein that is truly fucked and gone for good and one that just needs time to ""recharge""? What is the actual mechanism that causes a vein to disappear and never come back or just go for a while? (this is a really unhealthy thought really, but I struggle to worry too much about blowing my veins, because I know in the back of my mind, if I truly fuck all of them, I'll still have that un-killable extremely thick femoral to fall back on, if all else fails).

Finally, though I have hit all over my hands & arms, never ONCE have I been able to hit my legs, despite trying multiple times over  2 years. I'm not a fat guy by any stretch of the imagination, but my legs are certainly fleshier than my arms. I can see the veins on both my calves and my thighs, though they're certainly fainter/thinner than the ones on my arms. What am I doing wrong here? How do you hit the veins in your legs? I figure since I've never hit them there should at least be a couple that are good to go, but never once have I even got any blood from them , let alone hit, even though they bleed when I pull the needle out. Any tips/advice? 

**tl;dr**: 1: How come some veins are better after you've hit them a couple times? 2: Since some veins have become useable again after a break multiple times, how can I tell if a vein is fucked for good or just needs time to heal? 3: I've never ever been able to hit my calves/thighs after multiple times, how the fuck do you hit your legs?!

So safe to saay my tolerance is really high. Im going in for heart surgery february 11th, and so ive been trying to stick to subs and wben i do chip i try to only do 4 to 6 bag shots once a day. Heres my question for any of you who can help:

I told my heart surgeon im in recovery from heroin so he knows i have a high tolerance already due to the suboxone. So im not worried about when i get out oof surgery for the first week cuz theyll be giving me as much morphine as i want right after surgery. Im worried about after that first week,  because im going to be in 6 weeks of recovery from the surgery (obvi im taking off from work). In tbose 6 weeks, the pain pills they would give me arent going to work. I know it. My tolerance to oxycodone is retartedly high. What should i do? Should i stock up on dope just in case? I cant inject after my surgery or i run the risk of getting serious infection. So id have to snort the dope, wbich would provide pain relief...im just open to any suggestions to what any of you guys would do if you had upcoming surgery with a high tolerance. And ive been trying to stop doing dope in these last few weeks before surgery but you know how that goes.",1453575132.0

""Lifewise: A Tale of the Streets"". Please read & comment! :)","She stands on the corner, absent-mindedly smoking a cigarette and shifting from foot to foot. Shivering in the cold night air, her eyes mechanically rove back and forth, scanning approaching traffic for potential customers. At a glance, most people would never guess she was out there peddling her soul,  her body exchanged for the cash she needs to stave off the withdrawals one more day, to pay her board at one of the streets many dingy hotels.






 Despite the faraway look in her eyes, she is what most men would consider pretty, even beautiful, in a classical way. She has medium length hair, big blue eyes, and even, straight white teeth, which are set in a pair of full, glossy brown lips. Her legs are long, her breasts small and pert. She looks young, too. She is used to johns asking how old she is, as if they cared whether the blowjob came from some sixteen year old baby prostitute or a woman her 26 years. 







She just smiles and tells them she's old enough, though her smile never reaches her eyes. She has learned how to shut it all out, mostly by closing her eyes and losing herself to the darkness enveloping her. Sometimes, she'll replace the trick sitting to her left with memories of Him. The sex they had was unmatched, in her opinion. Of course, it probably didn't hurt that they were in love. Or maybe it was just her who had been in love.







 Love. Now that was a laugh. She wasn't sure what love was anymore. She used to be one man's everything. They adored each other. Then the heroin pulled them apart, bit by agonizing bit. Once she had a fiancé, with their own place, a little jalopy, and a goofy, loveable mutt. Once they'd lay in bed, listening to the rolling thunder and pouring rain, her head on his chest. She loved to lie that way, listening to his heart beat as he stroked her head. 









Back when the future held promises and the kisses were sweet. But all that got pushed to the wayside, to make room for the soft, warm misery of addiction. The kisses turned to thin-lipped anger, jealous accusations, explosive fights. One time, they'd quarrelled bitterly, probably over something trivial, and he had went and picked up a few bags, and upon returning did a two bag shot. She had begged him to take just half (the shit they got was incredible), but his anger and ego got the best of him. No sooner had he pulled the old, dull, spike the two shared from his bruised arm, than his eyes had rolled back in his skull as he hit the ground. The sound of her other half struggling to breathe was haunting.






She brought him back to, without Narcan or the EMT's. His good for nothing friend bounced out as she held him on the ground. But there wasn't a good Samaritan law like other places. She didn't blame him for not wanting to go to jail. And while it initially had scared the shit out of them both, they were back at it within a week.







 It hurt her heart to watch her relationships fall to pieces, all the while being the conductor on that runaway midnight train. Heroin won. It always did, no matter what Option B was.  It was an added plus that as long as she dosed, she could be numb to all the suffering her addiction caused in the people around her. And to the damage she had done to herself. 







She guessed she let all that get to her a little too much. Her life now was nothing she imagined it'd be, that's for sure. It had been 10 hours since her last dose, and as a man in a nice sedan cruises slowly past with it's blinker on, she feels the wet sidewalk jarring her spine with each ""clip clip"" of her heels. Fuck love, she thought. Time to make this money.",1453732728.0

It is the new human condition. It is inevitable, in a society where the highest mortality rate for 18-30 is opioid overdose, that there is a solution to this problem.
In the best imaginable world, humans should always have a freedom to make their own choices. they should be able to choose to use opoids and many do, and since the marketing of oxycontin in the 90s americans has a whole have embraced opioid use in a way never seen before, and with cheaper and more readily available heroin then ever, and suboxone for when you choose to stop using it, the pharmaceutical industry as well as the court and justice system clearly win from opioid addiction. 


We the people are hurt the most from the policies which are what will end up being millions of people who die to unexpected overdoses. There currently exists a technology that allows for a heart rate monitor to use the already smart phone in most peoples pockets as a life saving device. 
I propose that we create the app and framework in place to allow people to start having their lives saved in a safe and legal manner and hope for eventual policies which legalize all drugs and allow you to buy them in a drug store of guaranteed purity.


the supply and demand are there and society has to adapt to this issue which is here to stay, and the only rational way is through harm reduction, which would be accomplished by saving the lives of people who choose to risk them intentionally, and hoping to steer them into a positive direction to not be in a position to risk it.
people have always risked their lives for different hedonistic urges and we are not going to do away with it in the human so we should start as a society to mitigate the risk associated with these things as a way to lift the burden that these unexpected deaths bring to all of us. 
any app fees proceeds to to go harm reduction efforts and drug policy reform.",1453709966.0
42kd53,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/42kd53/introduction/,7,https://redd.it/42kd53,Icantastethewaste,Introduction,"Hello Everyone, 
I'm sitting here in the midst of withdrawals and I've read Morbo's book 2-3 times so I figured this would be a good time to introduce myself and maybe tell some stories. I've been coming to this sub for over a year but I have yet to post anything. I've been afraid of people discovering me but I guess thats pretty irrational. 

I'm not going to put much of a story here, more just some basic info about me and my use. 

The first time I used opiates, I actually hated it. I was 18 and prescribed Hydrocodone after a surgery and I really didn't like the way they made me feel. Fast forward about 2 months, a friend of mine offered me a line of dope... I had always said no but this time I said fuck it, why not. After trying that dope, I was hooked. I've been smoking weed since I was 15 (20 now) and I love weed but even when I was 15 I was using weed to try and make the world feel right and the weed helped but it really didn't make me happy, it just made things more interesting.  I felt like hard drugs were taboo but there was a part of me deep inside that knew I would be doing heroin one day. Addiction runs in my (white affluent) family. I tried sniffing some dope and was terrified that I was going to die. I didn't die and the next day I went through my house and found 36 oxy 80s (OP formula) that had been prescribed to a family member back in 2012 that they evidently had forgotten about or no longer needed. That was my first stash. Day 1, I took 1/2 of one and NODDED MY ASS OFF. I was sitting in my computer chair, unable to keep my eyes open, literally drooling on myself. It was amazing. I burned through that stash in 2-3 weeks and I was dosing 2 full 80s every day by the end. That was 16 months ago. After the Oxy's ran out, I thought I got the flu. Months later I connected the dots and realized it was withdrawal. I promised myself I wouldn't go get more, it was far too expensive. Fast forward to a year ago. A family member came to visit and stayed with me for a couple weeks... He had 4 bottles full of Morphine 60s, Oxy 80s, Oxy 60s and Opana 40mg (Global G74) and he told me he hated them. When I offered to relieve him of a few, he waved me off and said he didn't want to rip me off but a fair price of $2/pill seemed fair. It also seemed quite fair to me. Once I acquired this stash, everything went nuts. Those pills lasted me 7 months of hardcore daily use. Thinking about it now, I just want to go back in time and get all my drugs back :(. Those 7 months were the happiest period of my life despite me (being 19) deciding to drop out of school and get a job. In hindsight, I should have sold a few but I didn't sell a single one. The Opana was and still is, hands down, my favorite opiate. I started off with 1 40mg pill lasting me a week and by the end I was putting 2 up my nose in about 5 minutes and redosing every hour tops. It was amazing. Life had a certain magical sparkle to it. My birthday came and went. My grandmother died, bad stuff happened but I was just so damn happy. That was definitely the highest point in my arc of opiate use. Those lasted me January until July. I didn't take a single day off. I never once started going into withdrawals and I didn't even know they were a thing. I had read all the horror stories in this sub and I thought I was special. I do my last Opana in July and tell myself alright, time for a break. 6 hours later I was crying harder than I've cried in my life and ready to kill myself. That night I went out and scored some dope. It was a bundle and I had to sniff the whole damn thing to get rid of my sickness. At this point, I had a few basic rules, the most important being NO NEEDLES. That changed when my middle (a fairly attractive chick who I got along really well with) mentioned that she couldn't get high from sniffing it anymore but shooting 3 bags would have her higher than sniffing a full bundle. I asked if she could hit me and voila, needles became a thing. I found a connect for grams and was shooting 1-2g's/day. This is July. I was dating the perfect woman, truly the girl of my dreams. She was beautiful, smart and funny and we completed each other. She was my first love. Opiates quickly surpassed her but I kept it all a secret until a reunion with some friends when she found my Morphine... I told her too much and she decided I was a drug addict (obviously I was) and needed help. 2 weeks later I didn't need help, I just needed more drugs and we broke up. This became an excuse for me to go absolutely berserk. I picked up a substantial Klonopin habbit (used mostly to potentiate my opiates), starting at 1mg/day and ending at 25mg/day. I never had seizures somehow but Benzos are really really not good for me. I did stupid shit and didn't remember it at all. People told me I did and said things I would never do or say and I honestly didn't believe them for a while. I weaned myself off the kpins and told everyone I was getting clean. I had no intention of giving up dope but I sure did put down the kpins. At this point its August and I've 100% accepted that I'm a dope feen. I was also running out of money very quickly now that I was paying for my dope. An uncle came to stay with us and had a brand new, just filled script for Oxy 60s (OP). I saw it in his car and grabbed the whole fucking bottle. He couldn't find it, reported it and got a new bottle the next day. That first day, I took 16 oxy 60s over about 4 hours before cutting myself off. Once I realized how much I had done I was kinda freaked out but I was fine. I have never overdosed. I have Narcan on hand but so far I've been pretty lucky and thoroughly researched absolutely everything to know about opiates. In September I was living on my own, broke and depressed. I tapered down successfully and was able to get clean. It sucked. I still have haunting flashbacks to that 3 week period of cleanliness. In November, I was in an accident and shattered my collarbone. The doc prescribed me 120 dilaudid 2mgs for post op pain and then after gave me 40 norcos. The norcos got me high once but those Dalaudid made me so dam happy and really helped with the pain. Since then I've been trying to get my hands on opiates whenever possible but without much income ($12/hour part time) I can't get even close to high without saving up to get high once for 30 minutes. Since November, I've been able to IV heroin every day by some miracle but the past 2 weeks I've been weaning myself down with lope to try and mediate the withdrawals as well as taking gradually smaller shots. Right now, it isn't too bad, no pooping and I don't want to kill myself but its more like touching stuff kinda hurts and everything sucks and all I want to do is get high. I can't tell if I'm actually sick or just sick of being sober. In any case, this is the longest I've gone without doing drugs since September. I'm okay with it. I finally get paid and pick up on Tuesday, I'm already dreaming about the shot I'm going to do. Reading other peoples posts, I wish that I had started off slower and let my tolerance build slowly rather than going all out and ending up where I am now.

SO ya, thats pretty much my story. I didn't try to write this as a narrative but I am planning to write actual narrative stories soon. 

Cheers everyone :).

I lost my job about a month ago or so. Its been a struggle coming up with money for drugs but I've managed to not be sick a single day since. But I've gotten to the point where I have no more valuables to sell. Except one.

My dboy has been hassling me about my Xbox One, stating that his supplier is in the market for one and that he'd take 'great' care of me if I ever decided to get rid of it. I've been depressed as of late and wasn't getting much enjoyment out if it, and considering my tax return is in transit, I figured why not.

Dboy is contacted. A transaction is discussed and after waiting 3 hours, he finally comes through with the 'goods'.

On the phone prior to our meet up he states that his guy (guy who wants said console) has went ahead and given him my drugs instead of the original plan of bringing the supplier to our meet up. Cool.

Dboy gets to the spot and tells me his guy is in the car. Weird. But didn't think anything of it. Now I know ill get my ass ripped for this but I trusted my dude to not pull some shit and stashed the console in the back seat before I acquired my drugs. 

I'm handed my package, glance at it, and bid them adieu. I get in my car as they pull out and rip into the bag, due to sickness creeping in and what do I see? 2 plus grams of crushed up Advil with some beautiful orange pieces still in it. Proceed to call my dboy but alas, he won't answer.

Now I'm drugless and without my fallback money maker.

But, what he's failed to accomplish was anonymity. I've been to his house. I've been to his trap, and I've been in the house of his supposed supplier (guy who actually handed off the package). I'm not normally a violent guy, but ive got a violent temper and I've had such a bad string of shitty luck that I'm not going to sit idly by while these fuckers think they got away with it.

gotta close my mind

gotta be so cold

cold drifting real slow

and out of the dark

all in the light

under the lamp

where life gets ill

all the pretty living dead

pretty egos to be fed

I'm glad that I

just can't care

so glad that it's

getting there

talking real low sweet

watching real real close

make it seem so nice

when it's just like ice

when it's dead and gone

when it's sucked so dry

when it's black and cold

on this bright bright street

all the pretty living dead

pretty egos to be fed

I'm glad that I

just can't care

so glad that it's

getting there

gotta feel that way

gonna end that way

so easy just to give it up

so hard to really care

maybe I will fall

I have no hope at all

then I'll be no use at all

Ain't it fun when you feel like you just gotta get a gun

Ain't it fun when you just can't seem to find your tongue

Cause you stuck it too deep into something that really stung

It's such fun

Well, someone came up to me and spit right in my face

I didn't even feel it

It was such a disgrace

I broke the window smashed my fist right through the glass

I didn't even feel it

It happened so fast

Such fun

Ain't it fun when you tell her she's just a cunt

Ain't it fun when you she splits and leaves you on the run

Well, Ain't it fun when you broken up every thing that you ever done

Ain't it fun when you know that you're gonna die young

It's such fun

I text the guy- NO ANSWER
I facebook call/message - NOTHING.
For fucking 45 minutes I get no reply and assume that fucker got pulled over and arrested and the cop is staring at the text messages that we've sent each other(because you kids INSIST on texting instead of calling).

At Christing 8:15pm I decide fuck this guy, he's probably sniffing my shit at his house, sure in the assumption that I'm not willing to drive 40 mins away and confront him about it or in the hands of the pigs - and decide to get on the interstate and go to his house.

About 5 mins into the drive HE CALLS and says ""Christ man, you blew up my phone?!""

Like, seriously!? you no called/no showed and made me drive 30 mins away and call me almost an hour after the meeting time and bitch about the phone calls?

Basically he said he had car trouble and had the radio on and couldn't hear the phone.
The problem with his story is these are OP 40's and he likes to sniff them, so he uses the oven method.
He slipped up and said he had one before he came over and that they were great. This means the asshole copped then drove 15 mins home, baked them for another 15 mins before heading out.

Keep in mind I paid for his pill in exchange for him driving.

It doesn't matter how much money you put in the hands of the dealer on a weekly basis (a SHITLOAD in my case *above* asking price) they don't have any goddamn honor or sense of responsibility.

To be honest, I don't understand understand 'incomplete' cross tolerance).  

My questions are:

1.  Should I take the whole 60 mg at once?  (Obviously no one wants to over-medicate)

2. Should I split it in half or scrape the coating off?

3.  What is the most effective way to ingest the tablet (IV is NOT an option).  Also I'm pretty naive about various administration routes.  If it does't go in my mouth or up my nose there is a 99% chance that I have no idea of how to modify the tablet.  Especially since this is the only tab I have, I don't want to chance fucking the whole thing up.

4.  Any additional information you would like to give would definitely be appreciated.

An additional bit of info that may or may not be helpful, when I use opiates I become incredibly productive as well as feeling incredibly euphoric.  The way I've heard people describe what it's like for them to use Adderall, Concerta, etc. is how I feel using opiates.  Has anyone else had this happen to them?

By your past self, I mean you before any opiates, not like when you first started doing it on weekends or whatever (because most of us can probably honestly say we at least had a vague idea where this was heading). 

I'm taking about you when you just drank (if applicable) and maybe messed around with other drugs on occasion (like college, for example). Maybe you've tried opiates once or twice in the past or had a surgery script but it definitely isn't something you're actively seeking out at this point in the past. 

Now I'm not really interested with what you would say to your old self, or any type of warning you may or may not give yourself in this scenario. I'm curious how everyone's old self would react if they could somehow see and/or know all of the details of your addiction, how it started I guess, and definitely how it's impacted and changed your life. 

For me, I would definitely go back to the end of college or shortly after graduating. I was a partier but I had my shit together. I'd be really shocked to hear this. I mean, I never thought something like this could happen to me. Once I realize it's actually heroin shit would get so real, and then to find out I'm injecting it?! Damn. I mean, I'm still shocked that it got this far.

But what would you think of yourself? Would you judge you? I really wish I could honestly say I wouldn't and that I'm better than that but back then? I think I would...my first thought/concern would definitely be diseases, even though I don't share needles. Beyond that, ""dirty"" is the first word to come to mind. However, I'd probably be somewhat proud of how well I'm functioning, though disappointed that I'm not pursuing graduate work yet. And to hear about the state of my friendships would devastate me. 

How about all of you? It's interesting to think about stuff like this because it sheds some light on to how our friends react when they find out. Aren't our friends sort of reflections of our former selves? It also shows how much we've changed in both good and bad ways. I wouldn't judge myself or anyone like me now, but back then I was definitely more close-minded, despite boasting how open-minded I apparently was. I believe that going through an addiction, especially heroin/opiates, teaches you a lot about yourself and just human nature in general.

Visually, it is not discolored at all, it's just a hard lump right where my below bend is.
So what to do next? I do have health insurance and I'm totally not willing to sacrifice my health to keep this off my medical record. Should I go into the hospital today? Should I keep an eye on it for another 24 hours to see if it starts to reduce on its on?

I have a really high tolerance H habit right now and don't want to be shitting my pants in withdrawal while at the hospital. Should I wait until I have enough time away from my last dose to take a sub? Or will that interfere with painkillers they might give me?

To those of you who don't already know, this user is a cop who semi regularly posts on here. From everything I've seen from him, he's never posted anything negative, his contributions are relevant, and he actually posts some HELPFUL information, from the perspective of the other side of the coin, if you will, of a police officer.

I've seen some derogatory comments directed towards him and more than a few posters who seem to be ""spooked"" by his presence. Why? I don't understand this. As I've said before, everything he's posted has been positive. He's even admitted to coming to a better, more understanding outlook of heroin/opiate addicts. I just don't get some of the hate. I mean, damn, I'm pretty sure I remember seeing a comment or two where a poster actually wished death upon him and all cops. Really?!!

What is the harm? Do some people really think it's going to lead to him somehow getting one of us in legal trouble? Please. That is actually laughable. And also, how about the fact that there very well could be other cops who lurk or post on here, but just never volunteered what they do for a living? You would never know. But it's like because we know he's a cop, some posters just assume this is bad news and he MUST be on here to get us in trouble! Because you know, all cops are bad!

I know that these aren't the views of the majority of posters on here. Like anything else, just a few bad apples. But I was just curious of the thought process behind those who don't like the fact that a cop posts on here. 

(And no, I'm not one of those people who bow down to him because he's a cop. I couldn't care less. He's a normal dude with a job, like many others on here. He just happens to be a cop. He's just another human being).

My favorites are def clonazepam {Klonopin/Rivotril} and diazepam {Valium}, though nitrazepam {Mogodon} and bromazepam {Lectopam} are also great, though can be too strong, and I have limited experience having used them less (not very many times, harder to get ahold of). I find that zopiclone {Imovane} (similar to zolpidem {Ambien}, same family) works somewhat but its real beneficial effect is on the shots you do the morning and daytime following a bedtime dose the night before, really makes a difference there, and unlike when using it in conjunction with doing a shot doesn't make you experience the fucked-up feeling that comes along with actively being on a 'z-drug',

Currently my doctor prescribes me hydroxyzine {Atarax} (prescribed [to me] for allergies/as a sleep aid), a first-generation antihistamine, which works alright, but it is not a strong potentiator by any stretch of the imagination, i.e. not in the same league as a benzodiazepine. But it works decently well for being a mild potentiator, better than not having one. Also it works well for the reasons I am prescribed it for too, and my doctor hasn't a clue I'm sure that it has that additional ability to potentiate opioids, so that increases the chance I can get him to prescribe an additional one or two potentiators which I plan on raising with him on the next [couple of] visit[s].

Ideally I'd get one of the aforementioned benzodiazepines (for anxiety, I used to be prescribed clonazepam years back, and if he doesn't play ball I plan on seeing a psychiatrist soon anyway and I am sure I can swing that; keep my hydroxyzine on account of its treating of the symptoms I listed that it alleviates; and I also want to add scopolamine [hyoscine hydrobromide] {Buscopan} back into my prescription regime, I was prescribed it up until I switched to this doctor, to treat intestinal spasms, I just haven't brought it up with him yet.

I am 17, and have pretty much lived away from my parents since I was around 16. I think legally, I am still living with them, but considering that they refuse to let me into/near the house (“You’re a danger to your brother!” Lovely parenting, right??) IDK how a court could find that they are responsible for me. So since I was 16 I have been pretty much homeless (mostly just sleeping with friends/the occasional shelter).

Anyway, due to a wide array of stupid factors, my parents have decided they are going to force me to go to in-patient rehab for heroin now. My mom said this in one of our rare phone conversations. This stems from the fact that they caught me with heroin once maybe 2 years ago and decided that was the sole reason for why our relationship went down the drain. They claim that if I don’t go into rehab voluntarily, they will call the police and get the cops to take me to rehab by force. I don’t think I need rehab and I don’t think it would help me. I have used opiates on and off for the past few years, but I don’t agree that that is the cause of all my problems.  Do they have the right to do this? Is there anyway I can declare myself independent from my parents to deny them this? I have a job and go to school and if I go to rehab I would likely lose both opportunities.

I feel it in more of a pleasant way then the sub.

Price (free)

Never been regular in my life (due to cerebral palsy. It's a common issue for us.) more like 2 times a week at most. Always at home, always when SO at work or asleep. (Because that's how one properly deals with gross personal stuff) I take 2-4 doses of liquid morphine daily for about 2 years now plus my fentanyl patches. Been on the patches long enough my body has completely adjusted. However with the morphine for breakthrough pain my bowels often come to a screeching halt. I have at times had to resort to magnesium citrate😝
However my doctor just recently prescribed me a stool softener plus laxative. So naturally I've been using it as directed a few days with no result. So logically I thought I'll add another pill to the dose to help things along. No result after doing that twice. So I add over the counter laxative pills to the prescribed ones. Ends up yesterday I took the prescribed dose of the prescription laxative plus what's usually an effective dose of the over the counter laxative. About 20 minutes after my morning coffee, all of a sudden finally something is going to happen *something wonderful*..... I go and shit like a champ. No bleeding,no strain,stool softener working great. Flush, wash hands, sprinkle holy water and banish demons, all is well (or so I thought). Ten minutes later a repeat performance is required. Except this time its liquid burning garbage mixed with rotting corpse and shame. Flush, gingerly wipe unhappy butthole, flush, wash hands,sprinkle holy water, banish demons, all is well but not really. After 3 more of these I'm literally crying a little as I go and as I wipe. Horrible unspeakable evil is shooting out of me each time as hot burning lava and I am seriously questioning if one can actually shit out internal organs. I now realize that all the laxatives I've taken in the last few days are all working their horrible shit magic all at once. I am now laying down, little more than an empty husk cringing a bit each time I have to cough or sneeze (getting over a cold). I even took a dose of my morphine specifically in hopes of getting back to normal. Moral: don't double up on laxatives if you've been on them a few days already. Increase dose as little by little as possible. Always have wet wipes for emergencies. Toilet paper is an instrument of torture after shit number 3. And you can't actually shit out your kidneys or liver.(The more you know⭐) I'm extremely glad I have all of you to share this with.

I've been on a real tear with pills since late last year. I've used off and on, (more on than off), for over a decade, but circumstances combined which allowed me to ramp up my use to ridiculous levels. I had such a  butt load of them that I didn't pace myself whatsoever, like an asshole.  Ran out Monday, but I waited till now to try some sub, because I respect and fear the possibility of PWD. Do not want. 

The strip my friend gave me is 8 mg. I cut it up and only took approximately 1 mg, figuring that would be fine to start out with,  and it seems like it is. The restlessness was particularly horrible this time, and that's completely gone. Ditto the nausea and that generalized achy feeling. 

I desperately want to get some sleep tonight, so I am grateful I have this, and that it's actually working.

The only negatives happening are a slight headache and a ringing in my ears, but I am going on the presumption that this is a normal side effect. 

That's it, nothing earth shattering or insightful, but I have nobody to share this with, so decided to post here. 

Feel free to talk about the first time you ever tried sub. I had never even seen one till my friend brought this to me last month, although I had been curious for years. ",1453876922.0

First, the overly repeated but still somehow seemingly necessary preamble:
*Long time lurker, (sorry overly long) first time post(er) etc.
*And- im sure this has been posted elsewhere previously and i am completely unaware of any type of search function.
*****************************************************
---Having lived and enjoyed daily Diamorphine dependence in a few different metropoli here in the U.S. (always on the tar side of the mississippi), I see a lot of people just drop a chunk of darkness on some foil and then just go to town chasing it around until only trails of ash remain.  Thankfully, i have not yet graduated to using pins and until not long ago i would regularly reenact this same dragon-chase myself. But a few years back i was enjoying a few puffs with a german dj who used a slightly different technique which i have used ever since. I will now describe my version of this technique in unnecessary detail:

1.put some heat to the shiny side and burn off some imaginary chemicals as an offering to poseidon

2.place a few strategic water droplets (or spit, if you are that cool) on the less shiny side of the foil you are about to smoke drugs off of. the goal here is to add just enough moisture to reduce friction and allow your future-self to create a sheen of heroin on the surface of your foil. Try to avoid adding too much water as this will take forever to dry.

3.get a chunk of your precious drugs and smear it across the side of the foil you just added moisture to. you are trying to create a thin sheen across the surface of one side. Leave perhaps an inch around the outer edge of the foil because smoking drugs close to the edge is something you will try to avoid after the first few flame-outs. the first non-drug metaphor to pop into my head at this time would be greasing a cookie sheet with butter to prevent sticking.  

4.let it dry. it smokes 100x better when its dry and it doesnt take long if you used the proper amount of water. i will often prepare a few sheets at once and the first is usually dry or close by the time ive made a few.

Finally, smoke your drugs. the areas of the foil where you have smoked the heroin from will turn darker so you will see which part to hit next. 

*****************************************************
Perhaps i am completely delusional, but this way seems more efficient and less wasteful. There is very little residue, and therefore less temptation for golem-like excursions through the trash looking for shiny parts to re-fry.  also, as you pass these things around, each person will smoke a visible section of the sheet- and that one person who never pitches and never has drugs of their own will be less able to complain that they didnt get a hit. 
On the other hand, it could be argued that using the standard foil method can result in bigger hits, depending on how much you throw down at once. 
But ultimately, to each their own. Im just a drug-nerd who enjoys listening to NPR and far too many genres of music and watching overly-cliched so-called cult movies etc, while trying to prioritize personal freedom which I must regrettably interrupt with the minimum possible amount of freelance work in certain high-tech industries.

1) I am aware Oxy is stronger, then Hydrocodone. and finally Tramadol. Besides strength, would anybody bother to explain the effects and subtle differences in highs they experience from each of these?


2) Anyone else, like me, prefer the high of hydrocodone over oxycodone? 


3a) What are the differences between opium and heroin as far as high? 3b) And what differences is there in a opium junkie vs a heroin junkie? Does say opium ruin your life like some claim heroin to do?


4) I know it is dangerous to mix CNS depressants like Xanax and Oxy...would this also apply to mixing, say, Oxy and Hydrocodone? I figured it wouldn't, but don't get it. How is taking, say 60 mg oxy and 2 mg xanax more dangerous than taking say 90 mg oxy and 20 mg hydro?


5) How does a heroin high compare to say, large doses of Oxy? Basically same thing?


and finally, 


6) What is Kratom? Is it an opiate? What are the effects/high like? Also, would any local smoke shop carry it? Is it to be smoked, made into a tea. Also ran into this forum post claiming there's benefits like pain relief, reducing anxiety, anti-oxidant cell protection, immunity boost? Is this true? Lol. Seemed kind of strange to me. Here's the link to the article if anyone is interested: http://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/76995-kratom/



oh and I forgot, a couple more things


Would Kratom be safe to mix with Xanax? AND, how do you recommend I use/ prepare myself for using kratom the first time?



I am incredibly sorry for the assfuck of questions, I just had a lot on my mind after learning a bunch about opiates and drug interactions on this forum and was wondering about some things.


Anyone kind enough to thoroughly answer these questions, I'd greatly, greatly appreciate it.


Much thanks to everyone.

----------------------------------------

Hey everyone,

So I know I can easily grab one of these online, which I may end up doing, but due to my severe impatience I was wondering if there are any big chain / convenience stores that sell these, or if they're a popular item to be found at tobacco / headshops.

I already did some searching in local stores and couldn't find much, but I also wasn't really sure how to ask for help with finding one without raising suspicion (if that even matters). For example, I know that in the past you used to have to be careful never to mention 'weed' or 'bongs' in smoke shops, since all pieces/accessories legally had to be for tobacco only. So, if I were to go into a store and ask a clerk whether they have bullets for sale, is there a particular way I should ask that isn't too obvious?

Thanks in advance for any advice- I know these are very stupid questions but based on preliminary research and some stops at various local stores, I've found these harder to find than I initially assumed. I know I can probably get a much nicer/cheaper one online, but at the same time I would really love to be able to just run somewhere during lunch break and pick something up to tide me over until I pick out a nicer one.",1453994597.0

I got put on to it about 2 years into my habit and I never used another credit card to rack up a line again, never had to worry about losing some powder or finding a surface while in a car.

I'm not sure how common it is at all.  For those who don't know you take a large mcdonalds sized straw or large dunkin donuts sized straw and fold the straw about a quarter of the way up.  You drop the pill in the short side while it's folded up and then bite down on it crushing the pill instantly.  Carefully unfold the straw to keep it horizontal to the ground so not powder is lost then sniff away.  

Thought of this while posting in another thread and decided it was worth sharing for anyone who still racks up lines.  I get if you like to go through the process of making out a line but let's be real there's a lot of times it's not ideal (any bathroom at a bar, in a car, someone else's place who doesn't use) I just always had a couple dunkin donut straws around and I never did my 30s any other way.

This is the instance,
I introduce induction to my seduction of innocence into corruption,

only able to function in dysfunction, never able to decipher 'tween reality n' fantasy, 

stream of consciousness interrupted only by brief drug induced blackness, 

my corrupted regime to shoot my desire, leavin' me a moral technicality.




injected directly into my veins, is it all that I love or is it all that remains? 

confusing a disease with need, childhood wasted away sedated

Misread as wanderlust, really just lead by the rush.

A few pricks n' It's all over, venom givin' me my momentum.

All I want is sharp rigs, yet it ain't a necessity for tranquillity

cause i'm already scarred, so dull that they makein' my rhymes look sharper.




I'm left alone with my barbed poison n' bitter captivity

Imprisoned yet calm n' savoring my stay, push down n' blast away. 

The demon that slowly stole my soul away day by day,

Sick as hell, the chains weighin heavy, feeling like my mind is a cell.

I search for a vein, to relieve the worst of my pain, 

I aint no victim, I enjoy my imprisonment as a symptom.

a blossom of red, a plume of success, n' reality I've departed.

can't describe utopia as I run low on euphoria, 

I must be I'm dead, but our story won't be left unrecorded




All I crave is the crimson as that instant gratification hits,

all I require is chemical bliss, dope, all that's left of my adolescence.

Everyday agony gets dulled a little less n' I feel a bit more

Stopped working long ago yet it remains my recurring mission.

The substance that does this n' leaves you hurtin'

You think I'd be fed up, not even gettin' high,

without it I'd never be able to keep my head up.

You just don't get it, I can't fuckin' get enough of it.

Next shot that satisfies, might leave me broke down n' dead.




Already left addicted to death n' sacrifice, now convicted 

condemned to life in a cell I designed in my mind, 

judgin myself got me sentenced twice ended up fuckin' myself

assholes with cause n' effect continue to desensitize.

thinkin I was further from the edge, whole time I've been blind

Now I'm sick, feelin' dead n' never far from defeat, fcuk that I'm elite.

I'd do any crime to get my nirvana, one's the cops don't have codes for.

Who am I lyin' to?  Full rig only thing that leavein' me flyin'




I barely have a handhold, on all the lies that man was told,

caught in this stranglehold, wearing nothing but a blindfold.

I pawn gold for cash instead of paying cash for gold,

so I can hold a stash all thats asked is told .

spending all on consumable goods,

I do it all and can't help myself its irrefutable.

I'm a slave to the very shit that took my kid sister,

as my eyes glaze, irresistible, so insane it's certifiable,

not blind to the pain it inflicts cause I just got sicker.




Constantly dropping to the next level,

had a few true friends but I lost several.

when I'm gone n' out cause theres no dope around,

I'm forced to get sober so I walk without a guide to lead.

It's absurd how many times I've stabbed myself just to unwind n' bleed.

trying to find relief, headed for death n' bound to arrive in speed.




I'd be lying if I claimed I was unique, 

yet I can still spit more technique 

than you could ever hope to repeat

call me a junkie but I aint admittin defeat

might be leavein me broke but I've still got more dope

the race to the bottom has now begun

headed towards a personal grave,

If this is what my life has become,

I demand a motherfuckin' refund.




Thinkin I got everything under control 

whole time I've been on the devil's payroll

unaware of my decline, so invisible just call me divine

countin my billfold, one eye lookin out so I don't get rolled

Ridin' my downswing, intoxicatin' coast to coast.

Faded as fuck but never lost in unknown territory

empirically n' consistently leavin' bitches heads blown




Constantly craving synthetic blissfulness.

I come to test once again my mortality,

As if I've made my own fatality my conquest.

Heroin granted me wings n' eliminated the sky,

Then she left me stranded with nothing to do but get high.

A constant cycle of repenting n' sin, wash n' repeat.

discontent n' amazed at how many I can fool thru deceit.




Just getting by, coastin high, where did the time go?

My life flew by, deceitful just to get that needle,

Call me riddle woman, rig growin' dull as I indulge on your dime.

Waitin for the dope man to reply, state of mind dependin on my supply.


 
Accumulation of every wrong turn n' hasty decision.   

So skilled at dissuasion that they callin me a magician.

Strivin for what I loath, devouring anything to get high.

My disguise that hid the addiction, I denied n' spent vilifyin'.

I begged to go to rehab, doctors insist they hold the key.

I'll be better in just 30 days but my future is lookin' dimmer,

That's just ten percent of my dilemma cause I've already tried xy n' z




Drugs create an illusion of happiness n' a haze of reality.

seclusion all I'm giving n' you know addiction don't pay no salary.

A battle rages within, while addiction remains a selfish cunt. 

My ending always in sight, just an example on junk.

Full speed towards my shallow grave, might as well give in,

Death whispering empty promises of a painless destruct.

I wonder aimlessly searching for something but I'm stuck.




Sins in the past that I couldn't even begin to erase.

Instead I'll insert the syringe as it becomes an instinct. 

you'd think death would have me settin down the spoon,

Blood, sweat, n' needle pricks, it’ll be my turn soon.

Now I sit here n' wait as the drugs start to absorb.




No evidence, no corpse, just ashes in a plastic box, 

Just an older sister's ignorance, a pain you can't dose

They refused to act so now she's just a report, 

Fuck your values, leavein' no one to show up in court,

I can't be bought, ain't anything left to extort.

1. Yes, you WILL get addicted. If you are asking, you're already figuring out to use as much as you can without any detriment at all, which becomes how much without experiencing W/Ds, which becomes how much  to always be at least well, which becomes how much without gaining a needle-level tolerance, which becomes ""WHERE THE FUCK IS HE I *CANNOT* GO TO WORK IN AN HOUR LIKE THIS FUCK FUCK""

1. This is really more 1a, but that fucks with my sexy formatting. You are not unique. This sub has a significant amount of people (myself included) who are considered intelligent, went to good schools, have or have had good jobs, and thought that they were smarter than the drug. We were all wrong, to differing extents. Look up people who have called themselves ""chippers"" more than a year ago, then check their recent comments. You will find a lot of posts about being gay-for-pay (which I kinda wish I could do sometimes, shit makes up to like 4x what i end up making hourly), stealing from families, dropping out of school, and like their weird hustle training ferrets to pick-pocket.
 
1. You can identify any pharmaceutical from any developed country by google-searching the shape, color, and imprint.

1. Hustles: thievery then returning with variations if you need a receipt, like finding em in the parking lot first or something; panhandling makes more than you think; prostitution; weird craigslist not-quite-prostitution (yelling into assholes, pretending you are his wife and you're in a domestic dispute, etc.); middling if you're really dumb, have no concept of time, and are REALLY bad at conveying your location (LOOK AT THE STREET SIGNS NICK). I don't know why but those seem to be prerequisites for being a middleman. Any really amazing, unique hustles probably won't be shared with you because nobody wants their trick compromised.

1. If you're asking, it's an abscess. (but a missed shot =/= abscess necessarily, as pointed out by /u/indalcecio )

1. If you're asking, get a new fucking needle. 

1. We cannot tell you how much to take. You should start small and work up when trying a new pill/ROA for a pill, and you should do the same with EVERY batch of H. Don't get me wrong, practically nobody does it, but it would save so many lives if we all did. Tolerance will rise if you use two days in a row, and even if you use it less frequently with particularly high half-life stuff. If your tolly is higher than it should be for a use, TRY THE SAME DOSE AGAIN after another week before upping it further. It may have been some random environmental factor. 

1. To determine the which is the best route of administration, find the substance in wikipedia, and under the pharmacokinetic info in the sidebar look at the ""bioavailability"" section. It will give you bioavailability percentages for each tested route of administration, which is basically what percentage of the substance actually gets into your system. If that doesn't work google ""[x] bioavailability"" and go from there. Or just FUCKING SHOOT IT PUSSY.

1. Are you able to type a post? Then you haven't overdosed if you're shooting. You also haven't overdosed if it's been 1 or 2 hours for snorting or eating, respectively (inspiration from /u/DopeDealerForKids)

Ok that seems like it. If this gets upvotes, it'll stay near the top longer so that a higher % of this sub will be sweet, sweet drug porn and stories of degeneracy. So do it for me, and do it for that sweet, sweet selfpost not-karma. Stay noddy y'all!

I wonder if any of you have been having the same issue; getting access to naloxone without a prescription in California is still difficult, despite the new regulations. 

Perhaps it's just my area, which is slightly secluded from any larger cities, but I have been unable to find naloxone at my locals pharmacies, CVS included.  Each says that they are waiting on their physicians license, and have been since October. 

They frequently carry the 'version which requires a prescription' (just how they're licensed to dispense i guess), however I do not wish to have anything related to this area of my life on my medical records, where privacy could change at any time in future.

I have noticed that some relatively legit websites may be willing to ship from other states, but with a jumble of regulations (like no needles from NY state).

Are there any California based groups / resources / stores that I can reach out to that might ship me naloxone, to bypass working with regulations from other states? I had hoped that if I could find a California based pharmacy, I may be able to get them to ship me some.

Overall I must say I'm quite disappointed this process has/is taking so long, while so many of us are OD'ing..

So I got a pound of unwashed seeds from a very highly rated online vendor. There are actually some little pieces of non-seed in the bag, which I hear is a wonderful thing. Here's my plan.

I was going to start with a quarter pound of the seeds. Put them into a 2 liter and cover them in water with about a quarter to a half inch on top. I'm gonna squirt some lemon juice in there and then shake them off and on for 15 minutes. I'm going to slightly open the cap to get the liquid out, and into my cup, while leaving the seeds in. From there I am going to dump the seeds into a sock and squeeze them into my cup

I am going to down all the liquid from the quarter pound of seeds, then give them a second water/lemon juice 15 minute washing. I am going to set the second batch aside and wait about an hour and a half to see how I feel from the first washing. From there I guess I'll toss the seeds.

Does this all sound about right? Is a quarter pound of seeds to little, even for someone with almost no tolerance? Any further suggestions?",1453922575.0

He has been released from prison recently and is 90 days clean. These words sent a chill down my spine. 

""so... tonight im celebrating 90 days clean. which is great, im happy about it. but it in no way means im any closer to havin it all figured out. 3 months without a needle in my arm is obviously good, but ive had way more time than this, and it didn't stop me from fuckin up. however, I think im finally beginning to understand the information I need to stay clean. which is... wait for it... I DONT KNOW SHIT. and the moment I start thinkin otherwise I tend to fuck up. all I know is, I cant do it anymore man. I woke up a few days ago and realized im getting old. im almost 30, and ive done most of my adult life in prison. shit just aint worth it anymore. I always get outta jail, and within a few months il have my shit together. get a nice crib, get a hot girlfriend, get a decent job. things come together for me. why? because when I actually apply myself, im capable of accomplishing a lot. getting my shit together is the easy part. its keepin it together that I have issues with. but this last time broke me dude... I can honestly say that was my rock bottom. I had achieved so much in such a short time that even I was amazed. but then I turned around and destroyed it even faster. something I realize now tho, is I didn't lose it all, I GAVE it all away. nobody forces me to do the stupid shit I do. its all a matter of free will. this last time in prison I was soooooooo angry!!! everything was everybody else fault, no way I could be my own worst enemy, right? bullshit. I can be a good person when im clean. I can be a good friend, brother, son, and I even discovered I can be a good boyfriend. but the keyword here is clean. once I start usin, im not worth a shit to myself or anybody else. I become a cancerous fuckin tumor to anyone or anything around me. and that sucks... this last time around I was touched by goodness for the first time in my miserable decepticon life. I found out what its like to truly love someone else more than I love myself. I never knew such a thing was possible, because im arrogant, self centered, hateful, and closeminded. therefore, I believed the rest of the world was no different. but then I found out I was wrong. another human being brought grace to my life for the first time. I was shown a love and loyalty and previously thought didn't exist. a person loved me just because I was me... fuckin mind boggling, right? but rather than let that be enough to change, I STILL fucked up!!! I destroyed the only beautiful thing ive ever allowed into my life. and for that, if nothing else, I truly am a wretched thing. so yeah, I know that if theres something else after this life, il be on the express bus to damnation. but that's the funny thing about spirituality and karma, you get what you give. redemption is a powerful fuckin word. and no easy thing to achieve. yet I know, without it im doomed. ive only been home a week, and ive applied the positive spiritual principles of the program more than I did in the other culminated 29 years of my life. and you know what? it fuckin feels good. I never wanted to open myself up to others because I didn't want to be vulnerable. hell, I wear all kinds of spikes and a flight jacket covered in skinhead patches just so people wont wanna get to know me. the last time around I had a sweet little two bedroom house, a stunningly beautiful woman in my life, and good friends that actually cared. funny thing is, I didn't take not one single picture of all that for memory. why? because almost from the door I started lookin at my watch and waitin for it all to disappear. I became so obsessed with the idea of losing it that I became the same old self destructive loser I so badly hate. I threw it all away for a shot in my arm, and worst of all, other people suffered and are still suffering as a result of my animalistic behavior... and I truly believed I could never be redeemed. I thought a lot about doin a hot shot and simply ending my vile existence. you see that? what a fuckin greedy idea. my parents already lost one of there children to his own hands. and my best thinking told me to put them through that again because I was a coward scared to face the mistakes I made. I wasn't jokin when I said I was a shitty person. but no. that would be way too easy. what I need to do, is man the fuck up, and start fixing the damage ive caused. in this life, every moment that passes us by is another chance to turn it all around. 

we all have in us the capacity for change. I simply need to keep doin the next right thing, and with hardwork and dedication, even I can make the world a better place even just by not making it a worse one. and that's all I want in this life anymore. ive spent my entire life being a part of the problem and blaming others for my downfalls. its time to start bein a part of the solution and owning my mistakes, as well as bein honest and good to the people around me. if I give goodness to the universe, il receive goodness in return. and while I have an ocean of bad karma to swim through before the scales balance out, I know in my heart that it can be done. so, in closing, I apologise from the core of my soul to all the people ive harmed. and I beg forgiveness... I will continue doin what ive been doin lately, and maybe, just MAYBE, I can be redeemed.""",1453921750.0

So summary I just got on suboxone and will have my first drug tests on Tuesday night. But me and 20 of my close college buddies are going to ac on Saturday. I have seen 5-7 days for dope in the past but i think this is for addicts if I only IV once or twice on Saturday then drink lots of water can I pass in 3 days or 72 hours. My tolerance is large as im on 24mg of sub I used to do over a gram a day so those shots would likely be like .3-.4 area of strong ecp. 

If anyone has any person knowledge or experience of them doing it this would help me so much. 

Also im wondering about coke if dope is okay then coke should be too but if dope isn't do you think I can still do some blow that one night. Since most say blow lasts 2-4 days. Most saying more on the 2 day side. 

I'm taking my sobreity very serious this time but i still want to be able to do dope very very occasionslly im thinking at most once a month but more like once ever 100 days just on special times like christmas or my birthday. If I can do it this weekend then I'll not touch it again for a full month at least that's my promise. 

Also I've had friends piss dirty for opistes and there dr still work with them but give like 3 strike rule. He says on paper I csn be released from under his care at any point it's a case to case basis. Do you think failing my first drug test would be worse for me or better than failings down the road. Clearly it's very hard in the beginning and I still get lots of cravings. So if I do do the dope and believe I will fail. Any ideas what I should do maybe find someone with subs in them and get there piss. Or just be honest and say I was having cravings and messed up just once but regretted it right away after and went right back to subs and I don't plan on making that mistake of giving in ever again. Maybe I can convince him to keep me. 

Can anyone tell me about a time they pissed dirty for their sub dr and what happened and how far into the program you were? The more I know the better this would help me even if I stay clean this weekends for future knowledge would be great. 

Also anyone find a sub dr who took private insurance? If so how? Or if your like me paying out of pocket how much you pay. I'm currently at 200 a session which is everyother week so 400 a month. But if i pass all my tests it slowly goes down little by little to only 175 per session which is only once a month. But that may take 2-3 months.

As time progressed I started to see less pill porn, and more posts about narcan, suboxone, overdosing, low standards of living, and some pretty fucked posts by addicts. 

I never left the sub though. I was still incredibly intrigued. Only now I was intrigued with the other side of things. How insidious the path of opiate addiction can be. When I first subscribed I looked at opioids in a glorified way, I thought they were flawless. This sub very quickly taught me how stupid it was to take even a weak opioid like hydrocodone lightly. I'm an only child so I never had anyone to talk to about stuff like this. Had I not found this sub, man, I don't know what would've happened down the line.

I am very experienced with opiates. Pharms are my main thing. Oxy, Dillys, even extracted fent IV. So I have been all over in terms of strength. Also, pretty much a slave to the needle. When I run out of my pills each month I go for PST to keep withdrawals to a minimum if any at all. Then taper off that and have at least a week or so drug free. This keeps my tolerance pretty low. 

Well, I finally for the first time got some H and tried it IV. Was told it was pretty strong. So I started out small. quarter of a bag IV. Felt nothing. Went to half a bag, nothing. 1 bag, nothing. Finally it took almost 5 bags to even feel anything. No rush or nothing though. I didn't think my tolerance was high. The night before I had 4mg of dilaudid and felt a rush from that just fine. It wasn't mindblowing, but I felt it. All I had the day of trying this H was some PST, a small amount early in the morning. it was over 12 hours before I did this. Even when I do the same I still feel 8 mg of dilaudid even just 4 hours later. Is H really that weak? Was it a bad batch? I did get the rash/hives type reaction around the injection site, just like I get when I have had morphine IV. I do feel something, but it is very weak. And no rush what so ever. I went thru more than a bun trying to feel something and really haven't. There is something in there. But, I am just inexperienced with H to know if that is just how it is or my tolerance really is still there, or I got a bad batch. Anyone have any ideas?

Anyway, I've been out on Long Island lately and I've been forced to go through middles, which pisses me off because now I'm a) subsidizing the middle via tax obviously and b) I now have to deal with another undependable and late person besides the dealer. It's obviously not a huge deal but time is money, you know and one of my middles made me sit around for 3 hours the other day waiting for him, just to be forced to give him rides (basically held hostage) while I was sick, just to cop. He came through, the dope was fire but I was about to kill this guy (he's a good guy and I know he lurks so if you read this, no hard feelings bro).My other middle was a chick who was strung out on crack, a drama queen, a prostitute (no judgement) and she attracted police like none other. Literally every time I was with her, she'd picked up another charge in the days before and apparently, I found out she was a CI and would rat everyone out to get her charges dropped or reduced. 

Anyway, she picked up a serious charge and decided to give me a d-boy's number who is prompt and a chill guy with fire dope, in exchange for me taking her to court. DONE. Now I never have to speak to her again, and I have this guy's number. Linked with him, no tax, got a bun for 65 and it was real fucking fire, def no Fent and heavy bags from my estimation. 

This other guy, with probably the best dope on Long Island, I got his number today. He's a hard guy, def affiliated but he's pretty prompt albeit an asshole. I pull up to the spot, he makes me get out and sniff a bag in front of him. I hate driving while high but hey desperate times, desperate measures. I sniff a bag, we do the transaction, my middle gets his cut, I get mine and the middle says he's going away and gives me the guys number. So I have two reliable connects for the next month or so I'll be out in the suburbs. 

Its kinda a shitpost but idk I'm just elated and it feels good to hustle hard and finally get connects in a new area!",1454033504.0

I've seen a guide on bluelight about breaking the extended release mechanism of morphine pills. It's basically just crushing it into fine powder then letting it sit in water for 8-12 hours.


Has anyone done this without success? I'm not sure if I felt any difference in the effect/on set by just dissolving and plugging it right away than I did when I let it sit out for like 12 hours.

I had all the symptoms of an overdose.

This shittiness wore off about 12 hours after taking the pills and afterward I felt like i had a mild tingling wave that would roll through my calves and back.

The problem is it's been a week and I still and feeling this tingling, it hasn't gone away. I think it gets more noticable after I've had a meal. Maybe it's still in my system and I feel it more when my metabolism starts up? Should I be worried about this?

I don't have any experience with pills and kind of did this on a whim. It was pretty stupid. I'm really embarrassed to share this with others but I think I might ask for some help if this tingling doesn't go away soon. Any input is appreciated. I hope I didn't fuck myself up.",1454016504.0

It's been a few months since I've done any pk's, but I'm going on a ski trip this weekend (Fri-Sun) and I would appreciate some advice. 

I plan on dosing 2x 10/325 vicodin Friday night, then 2x 10/325 plus 1x 7.5/500 Saturday night. I realize the APAP dose is relatively low in those combos, which shouldn't be a problem but I'll most likely be drinking a little bit on the slopes early on both days. 

I'm recently paranoid about my liver so I'm just wondering if it's worth it to do a CWE on my pills. I realize the APAP dose would be nothing to worry about on its own, but I'm not sure how that changes with the addition of a bit of whisky in the same day. 

The only thing preventing me from committing to the CWE at this point is the possibility of the loss of opiate in the process, and doing the CWE with such few pills seems a bit unnecessary. 

Should I just suck it up and take the pills, or will the extraction be worth it? I'm okay with sacrificing a small portion of my hydro for the peace of mind, but I'm not sure exactly how much would be lost in the process. Any opinions? 

And I realize these doses are probably laughable to some people here,  I just need to quell my paranoia.

So tomorrow I'm getting some brown powder dope. What I'm wondering is, as an opiate virgin, will snorting a small amount of the dope (a matchhead size was repeatedly recommended) make me sick instead of high? Is the first opiate experience one with nausea, itchiness, and irritability? Or, if I experience these effects without really being high, is that it for me as my first experience or can I get high by bumping a teeny bit more (and is doing that relatively safe)? I've read that opiates become really good once you've broken into them a little bit, and I'm wondering if this is why. How long does it take to feel the effects upon snorting, like only two minutes? How long does this high actually last? How does one even snort such a tiny amount of powder? I found the answers to these questions were not at all easily google-able.

The past few weeks have just been way too much for me. Over 120mg oxycodone in a day. I know it's not the worst problem, but I need to clean up for a while.

Took my last dose tonight and will switch to suboxone (2mg) tomorrow morning/noonish. I am willing to work through some pain this weekend and then take norco's or higher dose subs on Monday to get back to work. I've done it before where even two days can even help me drastically reduce my tolerance to then ultimately taper to zero. 

I'm hoping to stay on the subs though and kick this for now. I am going on a trip to see family in 2 weeks and I just need to be clean.

I have 3 of the 8mg subs, 4 of the 10mg valium, a bunch of joints, and lope. I can get more of anything really. I think with some gatorade, food and will power (and 2mg of sub) I will get through this weekend and feel better Monday.

Basically I bought some A-215 Oxycodone 30 mgs. The imprint and color didnt look that sketchy and the consistency was only slightly weird bc it had water spilled on it.

However I was a bit confused when I tried eating half of one and it almost immediately dissolved on my tongue. I get that this could happen from it being waterlogged or whatever but it was pretty sudden. It also tasted pretty astringent or sourish kind of like vinegar for about 2 seconds and then it tasted bitter like MScontin or Oxy does.

My friend and I have pretty low to no tolerance and we ate 15 and experienced  an underwhelming high for what 15 has given us before. I also railed 30 and ate 30 over the course of an hour last night and only caught a nod comparable to what 20 mg did last time I did oxy months ago. We used White grapefruit juice, tonic water and benadryl to potentiate if that helps. 

I don't know if this is a thing at all but I have a lowkey suspicion it could be heroin just bc insufflation felt a lot more effective than oral which isnt the case for oxy but is for heroin. I'll upload a picture of one of the pills in an hour.

Thank you :)

So we had a tolerance, not huge but definitely there. So I did a lot of message board reading, found the best H dealer on there (we mostly had pharm hookups at that time) and ordered a gram, got in about a week later and it was light brown rocks...and I mean rocks, not even a tiny bit of powder. It was even a little bit hard to break down in water, impossible without a little heat. Everyone was saying to seriously start with only a tiny piece no bigger than the size of a match head, and they were not lying. Wow. The shit was unbelievable. Perfect rush of warmth, euphoria, energy, and had very nice legs. That ONE gram kept my wife and I in straightup nodsville for 7 and a half days. It was amazing.

While I think this is a nice thought, I also think it's really hypocritical of some people to act this way in some sense. (I do understand that a lot of us have experienced what heroin will do to someone, but I'll get this this later on in the post.) I've actually seen threads where people are asking about harm-reduction on the use of heroin, and a lot of the comments seem to disregard the fact that OP has a bag sitting in front of them, or they are 5 minutes from walking out the door to cop, and a lot of the posts say something along the lines of OP reconsidering their life, not doing heroin because most, if not all heroin users lifes drastically spiral. I understand that you guys are trying to help in the long run.. I really do, and I'm sure everyone can appreciate that.. but remember why you are saying these things... Did you listen to the warnings? No.. No you didn't, unfortunately, and neither did I. What makes you think someone so hellbent on shooting heroin is going to listen to some Reddit user, when most of us didn't even listen to the doped out fiend fixing up our first rig for us? A lot of us even got first hand experience to see what heroin does to you.. I know I did.. The first junked out loser looking motherfucker that ever slid that needle into my vein gave me plenty of warnings of this demon that doesn't seem to go away. Guess what I, and many of us still said? ""Load me up bro."" I know this might receive hate, but someone had to say it. Instead of trying to change someone's mind, and leaving it at the ""pointless"" information while disregarding important facts.. Say what you personally believe is best for OP, from the bottom of your heart, followed by harm-reduction like demonstrated below. I'm not saying that everyone does this, I've just personally seen it on this forum a good bit from a few individuals, and then after looking at their profiles it seems as if they specifically look for these kindof threads, to say almost the exact same thing to new users seeking experienced opinion/help.

I do have a job but who knows how long that will last with the inevitable wds I'll be facing soon enough and the whole homeless factor. I don't know what to do or where to turn at this point. I do have insurance, but that won't cover methadone or a visit to any sub dr around me bc it's Medicaid. I rarely ever comment on this sub and have never made a post, although I'm a daily lurker and love you all deeply, as much as a junkie can love another from behind a phone/computer screen, but I need your help fam. Some advice, kind words, encouragement. ..really anything positive at this point bc I'm drowning. I'm drowning in self-loathing, self-pity, anxiety, depression; I'm drowning in my addiction. 

   If you get nothing else from this post just know that it can and most likely will happen to you. Maybe not today or tmw, maybe not this year but eventually this shit will catch up to you if you don't get a hold of it and get/stay clean. Next time you think to yourself ""I can just do it once more,"" remember this post. Remember me. I had everything I could have ever hoped or dreamed of, sure I had problems but that's life, and I lost it all to this demon. Well I've lost everything except my amazing bf and we're in this shit together. If it weren't for him I'd probably kill myself. So yeah guys, that's where I'm at right now. Just remember. ..it can happen to you!

 
Tl;dr: Had 5 yrs clean, relapsed almost 2 yrs ago, lost everything and as of tmw will officially be homeless. ..it can happen to you too.",1454222940.0

43hten,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/43hten/selfeulogies/,29,https://redd.it/43hten,Marb100,Self–Eulogies,"Hey all,

I had an idea while I was in the shower yesterday, buzzed and spacey; this subreddit and others like it are fairly high-risk communities, and it's not uncommon for members to fall prey to their vices, taken before their time–killed by the substances they loved and hated most. Often, those who pass away are pillars of the community, users we've talked to and joked with for extended periods of time. Sometimes they're users whose updates we've read over time, strangers on our minds while we think about our own lives and theirs in parallel. When any member of the community dies, they leave a hole, significant no matter how active they were.

Anyone who starts using opiates knows the risks. Jails, institutions, or death, as NA says. But when the last result hits us, we don't have a chance to speak after our deaths, to leave behind a memorial in our own words.

I was thinking that each user who wants to leave a piece of themselves in /r/opiates, in their voice, should have that opportunity. To keep it short, I was thinking anyone who wanted to could write a short piece about themselves and send it to a keeper, like an /r/opiates biographer, in a sense. If any user in that group later dies, or is incarcerated or what have you, whoever has taken it upon themselves/is appointed by the sub to keep all of those pieces of writing can then post the deceased user's self-eulogy.

Thoughts?

I'm not good with dealing with emotional pain or I wouldn't be an addict.  So, I went off the subutex I was on and a ""so-called friend"" gouged me for 8 ball of fire.  So tonight I decided to get good and high, so I put more than usual in the spoon.That still didn't look like it would do the trick, so I added about 25% more and had a nice little mountain of powder.  I added my usual 40 units of water and that didn't dissolve it, so I added 30 more and that did the trick.  I noticed when I drew it up that it had made 10 units of water and was as dark as ice tea.  Something (JJ) told me to only do half of it and boy am I glad I did.  As soon as I pulled the rig out of my arm I had one of the more intense rushes I've ever had.

A friend of my gf's just recently got hooked on oxy's last year, and her connect died at the first of the year. So she called us up about a 2 weeks ago and asked if we can get some for her. I told her my prices (i didnt add any tax), and told her that usually when i go and get something for someone, if it between 1-10, i expect a half, 11-20, a whole, and so on and so on. 

First time she got 9 - she gave us a half.

Second time she got 8 and said she was gonna give us 10 tramadol when we got back to my house. Didnt happen (said she forgot to drop them off at the pharmacy).

Third time she got 7, didnt give us anything and said she forgot the trams at home.

She came tonight for 9 and brought us 4 x 50mg tramadol. On the way out i asked her if she was giving us a half this time, she said she brought the tramadols. I said ok.

I met the guy, stuck 1 blue in my pocket, had the rest in my hand and handed them to her (they were mix of blues and greens). Got in the car and she said she only had 8. I acted like i mustve dropped it. We looked for about 15 minutes, then she went straight to accusing me of stealing it, and planning this out. I denied, then i was pissed that that was one of the first things she thought (she has been friends with my gf for around 15 years, and i have been friends with her 5, and never had done anything like this). She flew back to my house, when we got their she cussed my gf out, and i told her not to call us anymore.

It's 25-30 mins each way to my guys house, and it usually takes him 10-15 mins waiting. So i dont understand why she thinks i will do all this for free - ive even told her multiple times what my ""tax"" is - so its not like she forgot.

How wrong am i here?

quitting has been kinda hard, my question is will being off opiates for a while make me look better? or maybe have more energy, a cleaner face, any other benefits? stopping sucks alright and if there's any positive impacts as a result of becoming clean now, that'd be awesome and help my mojo rn.

my acne has been mild for a while but usually up/down, would be cool to have a cleaner face or maybe just more healthy appearance w/o drugs. although i do look healthy and pretty good rn. idk.

Five years later I am day one detoxing from 120 mg daily oxycodone. I tell myself it's instant release and I took small doses spaced out so that number actually as bad as it looks. And that number is even the lower boundary on the sliding scale that is the truth. I have detoxed before from lower doses and it hasn't been fun, but one week and I'm back on my feet and actually doing well. Then I can enjoy the few weeks that I have before I slide into alcoholism or some other unhealthy behavior before then collapsing into the fuck it that is oxy relapse.

This time, my drug use is worse. I really can't stop. I guess I just didn't want to. Three or four times I got to the morning of day 1 and just said ""I can't do this"" while sending the text. I'm here now, and it's after noon and I'm doing this. It's also my birthday. There's something about wanting to start this next year from a clean place. Compartmentalize my problems and send them to the past. This time it was really too much. I always wanted to rob my long time dealer on my last pick up. I always like to destroy things  and I just always wanted to blow up that trust I had built up over the years so I could never go back. So I could really be free. I didn't do that because reality is never that eventful. 

If this time is going to work for real, then I need something different. This time I am going to use Valium through the detox. I think it's the only way I'll stay compliant this time. I fucking hated on Xanax and stuff for so many years. Here I am begging for it's help. I'm taking small doses of Valium this time with very small doses of suboxone. I am doing this for 2 days. Saturday and Sunday. Just get me to the office Monday morning looking slightly better than a recovering oxy addict.

The Valium is helping because it is treating my main ailment: Anxiety. I use drugs because I am anxious. It's unsurprising that small doses of an anti-anxiety medication is helping me avoid the temptation of large quantities of opiates. I know I can't keep taking Valium or Xanax though. Just for this weekend. It's probably time I find a therapist.

I will stay somewhat sedated for 48 hours and then try to move on with my lift. I will keep my body hydrated, fed, and comfortable for the next two days. Then I will push myself back to work with dwindling doses of suboxone. I will keep some Valium on hand once I am clean...just a couple...to push myself through cravings. Because if I can just take a xanax and sedate myself through a craving, it's better than using.",1454186000.0

I just miss my Xanax and my dope so bad. I hate dealing with shit. I just hate everything. At this point, I don't even know why Im staying clean. I have nothing down here anymore. The one person I thought would be there, isn't. I made the mistake of getting close to someone and trying to build something not built on drugs. I just hate people. I hate everything. I would do almost anything to get high. 

I honestly feel worse off clean than I did using. ",1454174542.0

i just actually learned about this group and made an acct like 5 minutes ago and this is my first thread. anyways my thinking is that these dickfaces typically use fentanyl to make a few HOT bags to put some unsuspecting user over their limit so they fall out, generarting hype for their stamp/bag/batch, whatever, with no regard to whether or not this costs someone their life. its honestly sickening, but i digress... i recently moved to AZ, and while if found some powder out here, its mostly tar, as im sure u can imagine. tar is sold off the scale typically, i mean in reno, back when  i lived in south lake tahoe, we would get little dime-bag-baloons, basically, but they seemed just a way to portion out the product, not brand it like you have with stamps on the east coast, and bags/foils like in chicago, my home town. that being said, i KNOW theres obviously a major prevalence of these cocksuckers dripping a drop of fent on a bag/foil here and there, donning their ""brand"", and therefore effectively (unfortunately) marketing their gear as some heat.. my thinking is that since there is no branding going on with tar, there wouldnt be as much benefit to hitting it w fent. not to mention it comes bulk, not in individually portioned bags, which just seems kinda impractical to just drop a drip of fent on say an 1/8 ball and let it soak in, making one region more potent. obviously this can still happen, but i dont see it as being quite as likely to occur, therefore making tar a safer bet than ecp in regards to the possibility of a fent OD.... 

whaddyas think tho?

So I was watching requiem for a dream last night for the hundredth time. Great movie and for any new users you should watch that movie bc it pretty much shows you how things could end up if you keep using. Anyway does this piss anyone else off.. Every time they get high on dope the camera zooms in on their eyes right after they IV and it shows their pupils getting bigger. I dunno why but it kinda pissed me off. Like how can you make such a good movie but mess that part up? It should be showing their pupils almost disappear bc they get so small. ,1454172807.0

   Last night I plugged 180mg morphine after using the restroom. Followed by 7 perc 10s. I went to my friends house. His mom gave me 4 roxy 5mg and 2 xanax bars. I took one bar before bed. Up all night trying to piss. Nodding out and hitting walls, the trash can, falling into bathtub, into shower. Haha good times. Time for work. Yay adderall!!",1454170670.0
