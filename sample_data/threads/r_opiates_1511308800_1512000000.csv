Long story short, I used soo much opium over the span of 1.5 months, that when I stopped I went through all the nasty withdrawls for like a week and a half. I don't want to experience that shit ever again.

How do I smoke opium without fucking myself?

Day on, day off maybe? What is your routines?

Remember I'm using opium, with all the alkaloids, not heroin or fent or any other shit. 

Anyone else have experience with real opium?

Thanks guys, peace & love",1511366124.0

i’ve snorted before and often got  relief but no more relief than sublingual, they both work the same.. , but it’s too easy to swallow your saliva under the tongue, therefore easier to waste  snorting is pretty impossible to waste really.  and it must hit quicker as well right?

I'm even having a very very hard time writing this because i am so insanely itchy. but you know, in a good way.

so the patch i got is a mylan (so non gel I hear? is that correct?) 12mcg/ hour that expired in 2015. so my questions are simple but googling them only found conflicting info, that it seemer no one agrees on. I'm looking for personal expierences or just genuine knowledge of this stuff

So, in 6 months of daily use my tolerance grow up fucking much, I started with codeine, one week later I tried oxy, after that I was hooked, best feeling in my hole life, started using everyday, one time per day, every night to be more specific, oxy started to be very expensive, I switched to morphine sulphate, because is more cheaper where I live. The only ones avaiable here are these 3, plus methadone and tramadol. Tramadol sucks, so I never really bought it, I tried once, and it sucked hahaha. So my tolerance that started on 10mg oxy, is now 200mg of morphine everyday when I get back home, I wait like 24h between my doses. I am having money problems these days, and methadone is the cheaper than every other avaiable for me, so can I use methadone to save some money, like if I take the dose when I start feeling withdrawal in the night, can I skip the other day without getting sick, and after 48h do my usual morphine dose? if I do that, I can save at least one day of morphine. I am already doing my dose with benzos to use less and get more of the pills, but fuck I dont wanna get hooked to benzos too, I abused them this whole week.Can I use methadone to save some money? or it will be worse?

I don’t mean to be a downer and just pass this by if it bums you out too much but I’m out of my mind depressed and have been for weeks. Well, years and years if I’m being honest but the latest bout has lasted almost two weeks straight. 

I haven’t gotten out of bed except to piss or grab some bites of food but i do so when I know everyone else in the house is asleep so I don’t have to see them. This is my MO when I’m like this. I haven’t seen the sun or had fresh air in about 9 days and all I want to do is sleep. Even when I’m having nightmares it feels so much better than being awake, I actually enjoy them. Like fun little interactive movies. 

The longest I’ve gone just laying in bed is 3 weeks and I feel like I’m well on my way to surpassing that now. 

I’m not using right now. Trying to not even drink. This seems to happen the hardest when I try to get sober. I like that I’m not using every day but it is obviously not a healthy trade off if the only thing I do when I’m not using is sleep and avoid the sun and people and the only time I’m energetic and productive is when I’m high. 

Anyone else? I think I just want to talk to someone right now and I’m at the point where anonymous strangers over the internet on a drug forum will do. 

I do watch a  lot of comedy. And I get way nostalgic. I wish it was 1992-1996 every day forever. Anyone else?

So I had over 8 months clean and sober and decided to relapse. Wasn’t going to get dope bc I’m on probation for another 3 months with urine tests often. I loved u4 tho before I got sober and honestly planned to chip, but we all know how that usually ends up. Anyways, got the u4 (4g of it) and waited til night time to use it. 

Drove to my local pharmacy to buy some saline nasal spray to help my sinus a little bit bc this shit is caustic. Decided to do a tiny bump of u4 in my car before going inside, to test the waters. I ended up doing 2 small little bumps without weighing anything out. I had taken bumps of it before but I was clean for 8 months prior and I had zero tolerance to opies at this point. I know this was stupid to do, but I thought I could handle it bc really they were tiny bumps, smaller than what I would do before wth other batches. This batch must have been way more potent.

I start feeling really good and begin to walk into the pharmacy to buy the saline. I quickly realized it was too much, it kept getting stronger and stronger as I go into the store and walk to the aisle with nasal sprays. I knew I took too much, I started to lose my balance and my vision started to go a bit blurry. 

I get to the cough/allergy aisle and look for the saline spray, but my vision got mor and more blurry and I couldn’t focus on anything and couldn’t see what I was looking for or read any text on any products. My balance got worse and worse to the point where I could no longer stand straight. From here my memory goes pretty cloudy.

I started swaying hard from side to side trying to stand straight. Bumped into the shelves behind/in front of me a few times. Ended up on my knees and knew I was fucked at this point and knew I had ODd.

Next thing I know there’s a bunch of paramedics around me calling my name. I was very confused and disoriented, it felt like I was dreaming. They loaded me onto a stretcher and started to take me out to the ambulance. I realized what was happening and was no longer confused, so I tried to get off the stretcher and tried to tell them that I refuse any treatment bc they said they were calling my mom and I’m on thin ice with her and I’m on probation so I didn’t want to be found out that I relapsed.

They said I was unconscious and not breathing for several minutes before they got to me. My heart rate was at 180bpm now and my mom showed up to the ambulance and they convince me to go to the hospital and get treated. I then spend a few hours in th ER and eventually go home, somehow thought of a lie to cover up using u4. Denied taking any drugs and even asked them to test me for proof (knowing u4 doesn’t show up on drug screens). 

Fucking shit...

My friend had found some old percocets he was prescribed in his moms cabinet, and i bought them all of him (he not into that). 

I tell my fiend friends and they’re all over me the whole day unti it’s 7th period and my friend and I decide to skip it the period. We escape the school and start walking to another friends house, who wasn’t there but he said he had some bud that we could take. 

He fucking lied to us and there was no bud and he said “his brother took it” (complete lie). Luckily I had some weed back home but it’s like a 45 minutes walk to there from where we were but we said fuck it and started walking. 

So he knew I had the percs on me (5 mg pills) and I had 4 of them. I thought I had 5 and I was planning on taking three and giving two to my friend, but after I took the three I noticed there was only one left so that confused me, but he didn’t really care so I just gave it to him. We popped em on the sidewalk and headed for my house.

I really started feeling it after about 35 minutes and I get the weed and we go back to his house to smoke. Laying down can enhance the opiate high immensely so I’m laying on the couch and I start to feel really good, much better than walking. We smoke and then lay back on the couch. Immediately after the hit, I felt super cloudy in my head and I couldn’t put any words together and could barely walk, and probably looked retarded in front of him cause he wasn’t as fucked up as me.

I lay on the couch and just pure euphoria hits me. Just simply staring at the window was pure bliss, one of the best highs I’ve ever had. Weed and oxycodone are a match made in heaven in my opinion. I was totally nodding hard and one second I was talking to him and the next I was asleep and he was like “dude are you okay” haha.

I’ve used this sub a lot for info on opiates and dosages and whatnot and i would like to share my story for others to be wary/ compare stores. So pretty much my opiate usage started in January of this year. My dad had had severe back injuries and therefore accumulated thousands of Norco (hydro10/apap325). I started small, few at a time nothing crazy as to have my dad not notice but after a while, ran out and stopped for a while. One day upon searching i found a large large storage of pills my dad had hidden and went to town. I quickly ended up 24 pills a day for about 3 months until i ran out. As i was running out my parents discovered my usage and talked to me and since i was out of pills it was time to stop. Now there were still some left that i was going to use on occasion when home from college. This happened multiple times and went well taking around 10 pills and having it go alright. Well, last Friday night i had taken 10 norco 3 oxy snorted and 3 tramadol. Next thing i know I’m in the hospital apparently I had puked while knocked out, inhaled the puke, had cpr done on me, and ambulanced to the emergency room. 4 days later, i am still in th hospital recovering from my pneumonia. My time here has been alright but the psychiatrist lady had been pissing me off trying to tell me what i think and feel and not believeing me when i tell her I’m not severely depressed. I’m being sent to outpatient paychiatric help. This is completely unnecessary because 1. I had no intention to harm anyone or myself it was a complete accident 2. It was a 1 time dose and I’m not hooked at all. This is a long story but I’d just like to share with everyone here thanks !",1511317767.0

 Fuk blues. Overrated and expensive garbage with a weird mental high that ha me agitated and absolutely can't cum plus you can't really get a rush  from banging and also it's a lot more addictive and harder to get off than hydromorphone or hydrocodone.

Look at the news and the country. What are they mostly addicted to when it  comes to  opiates?

Number 1 is dope and number 2 is oxycodone and number 3 is probably hydrocodone but it's so far down from oxy and dope by miles. I don't know the hype of oxy. I started doing oxy because of the hype over norcos and you could snort it without apap and got terribly dependent and addicted.

I can safely say and knock on wood that hydrocodone and dilaudid don't make me crave the next day plus thr come down us so amazing. Oxycodone come down feels like shit and just overall very bad which is why people are so terribly hooked on it.

Im glad to be off it.

I owed 15 blues to Cliff on Thursday's pay day so I pulled money from the ATM, and Cliff went to his guy to get 20 blues. He gets 15, I get 5. Some times he'll snort one blue but other times during this day he'll snort two at the same time as I've observed twice.


Later that evening, I'm on my way home from work and I answer my phone where he presents a proposition. For the days leading up to pay day and the week prior he kept mentioning how he has a friend who has a Suboxone script. This friend no longer uses dope but has a brother who does. The Sub connect would sell us a bunch of subs at a discount as long as we bought at least 20. 


&nbsp;


Being that I had $190 left after buying the blues and settling my debt from the days prior with Cliff I was planning on spending no more than $100 on subs. I didn't care about getting a bulk discount since even five subs would last me quite a while especially if I tapered down between this and next week. On the days leading up to pay day Cliff kept mentioning about his friend and the bulk discount and how it would be great to have all of these subs for the holidays. It's an easy sell because he knows I put importance on not being dopesick when visiting family on Christmas as an example.


**Sidenote** - Last Christmas I made a spreadsheet to ensure that I did not run out of dope when visiting my relative's house for a feast.

&nbsp;


Okay so that Thursday evening on pay day after already copping I put forth my last $190. I get 1/2 a bun and Cliff indicates that he bought two more buns to give to his sub connect who would in turn give those two buns to his brother. Come Friday afternoon he claims that the sub connect's brother came over at 7AM to pick up the 2 buns of dope (the sub connect was originally supposed to show up at that time) with the promise that the sub connect would show up later.

&nbsp;

By the time I showed up on Friday afternoon to get the bad news Cliff was laying in his bed as he does on days when he runs out of dope and is experiencing the early stages of withdrawal. So at first I thought maybe his BS story was true because he didn't have enough time to do two buns and get dope sick. 


Heck, even his text messages on Friday morning were in sync with the appointed times. It appeared as though he did stay up and wait for his friend to deliver the subs. 


* 6:30AM - ""he's coming"" 

* 7:30AM - ""he's coming shortly I'll alert you when he does.""

* 11:00AM - ""He'll be here before one, I lost it on the phone before. My mother was so scared because I SNAPPED at him and we ARE getting extra.""

* 12:30 PM - ""I'm waiting ofr him now I'll text you when it's here""

* 1:15 PM -- Upon me asking if the guy is enroute, response is: I hope so he said a few minutes after 1pm and I just asked as you texted me""

* 2:00 PM -- I ask again if he's coming, ""wiating for that answer""

* 2:02 PM - ""His last text he said he left his house""

* 2:27 PM - After more of my short inquiring, ""I have window open I'm just closing my eyes til he arrives. He's coming in when here dont' worry""

* 2:28 PM - ""I'm pouring sweat""

* 2:29 PM -- ""ok well I'll either have a bunch of subs or a bun if he don't show"" (at this point it's my understanding that Cliff is still hodling on to 2 buns of H as part of the trdade for the subs)

* 2:30 PM - ""He's shwoing I'd bet my bun on it ! Did you take your last bit of sub?"" (I had less than 1mg of sub left, I did take it and wasn't going to shate it anyway -- I shared 1mg of sub with cliff the other day an hour before his dboy delivered, had I not I woudl've had 2mg of sub!)

* 2:31 PM - ""I'll be texting you shortly watch""

* 3:15 PM -- I say I can't believe there's no update. Cliff responds, ""I'm waiting anxiously trust me""

* 3:17 PM -- I state that I'm giving it until 5pm then I'll come thru in person for an update. Cliff says, ""ok I'm praying and will text you before then""

* 3:28 PM -- I indicate that I'll arive after I take a shower. His response, ""text me before you come please""

* 4:29 PM - **""I fucked up dude. We have to decide what to do.""** In my mind, fuck... This.

Maybe I'm a smug asshole but my response to that was ""Well, admission is the first step. I'll be over soon I'm getting dressed."" Then finally I indicated I Was on my way.

&nbsp;

Upon my arrival Cliff says ""the sub connect's brother came at 7:30AM, picked up the dope."" He also indicated that the Sub connect stopped answering his phone at 2:30 PM. Now based on the text messages listed above, there is no indication that the sub connect's brother came to pick up the dope so it's hard to believe it as truth.

&nbsp;

There didn't seem to be enough time to do 15 blues + 2.5 buns. He only picked up the H Thursday evening on the same day he picked up 15 blues. Even if he burned through all 15 blues by 9PM It's difficult to believe.

Maybe a good part of the money went towards paying for thanksgiving dinner to get his mom off his back?


&nbsp;

I cant' be certain if I was lied to or not, but in the past Cliff said that he was in contact with a sub connect but when I went to speak to that sub connect they said ""no, he has not messged or called me at all about needing to get subs."" So that time I spent my money on dope for him and I with the understanding that he had money set aside for subs but he did not. Due to that instance of lying and others before it... even in this situation where It's really hard to figure at what point in time he engaged in foul play I feel inclined to exercise caution and to look out for myself.

&nbsp;

When Cliff gave me the bad news on Friday in person, he gave me $20. He calimed that he, ""found it in my other pocket.""


On saturday morning he asked for the money back to buy dope on credit that he'd share with me. I insisted on not doing that but I couldn't guarantee being able to get subs that day and since he already called the house phone I went ahead and gave the $20 back just to quiet him. Coincidentally, his dope guy delivered at the same time the sub connect asked me if I needed anything.


&nbsp;

Took the off work on Saturday then found a way to earn subs on Sunday. At that point I didn't share because I want to make sure I can get through a long week which includes Black Friday in retail. 


Sometimes I think he's allergic to subs. Today and yesterday he's asking if I had any luck in getting subs yet. I keep lying and giving postponements as he has done to me in the past. 


I don't get it.... but my best buess is he has no foresight and is selfish. Doesn't do the logical thing of getting subs for after a dope binge until it's too late. Suddenly he cares about getting subs whem all other options for getting dope are exhausted.


&nbsp;

It's bullshit like this that has me at wit's end, and is the reason why I scheduled an appointment to see a doctor to put this lifestyle behind me. I refuse to be conned out of my money before Christmas. I need to buy presents for family members and not have to lie through my teeth. I also need to invest in upgrades for my ride.


&nbsp;

I provided a detailed account of the messages from Friday morning and afternoon to see if there's anyone who thinks I was **not** scammed. I'm assuming I was based on history but if not for that I would've believed in his story and given a portion of any subs I obtained this week.",1511295266.0

Yay.","Back in August I posted in this sub and got a ton of support as I was going through a rather painful withdrawal after a year of daily use. I stayed clean for 21 days.  

I wanted to be sober for a trip to Iceland I was taking for a variety of reasons - I was going to be alone with my family for the first time in a year, I was going to be experiencing something I didn't want to forget, I didn't want the hassle of traveling with illegal shit - you get the point. 

But the day I got home I dosed. I fucking got home, brought my suitcase up the steps and went to the medicine cabinet. I stared at the pills for maybe 30 seconds wondering what the fuck I was doing. I poured a pill into my hand, stared a little longer and then tossed it back. 

Since then I've been on a binge, back to 90mg of roxy or more a day. Fuck it feels so good. God damn I hate how good it makes me feel, how nothing - *nothing* can make me feel that way. Nothing makes the anxiety and depression go away, nothing helps me sleep better. I hate this drug but mostly I hate how much I love it. I hate how much I feel like it ""helps"" me.

So now my plug is dry and I'm back on day 2 of sobriety. Fuck my life how can the w/d be worse after a 3 month binge than a full year of use? But it is. It's worse. 

Plug says I'll have 25 pills tomorrow, which will be day 3. I'm telling myself I'll try not to dose but the truth is I know I'm going to fucking eat them as soon as I have them in my hands. And then what? 

A few days later I'll be right back where I am today. What an asshole I am. I don't know if I can live a sober life anymore. Not a happy one, anyway.

I happened to be crossing the street to go to the liquor store that's right by my complex. I see a girl I recognize on the way back. Someone who I know is best friends with my old manager who I'm very close with. She and I start bitching about the ""new"" manager. Douche fuck stole some of my pills about a year ago. I tell her that and we're just having a lil bitchfest. So next day I'm walking and doing God knows what at my complex, I can't remember. I see my maintenance guy. He's probably the kindest person you'll ever meet. He has child that is special needs like mine so he and I talk a lot. We start talking about something and the neighbor comes up. He trips out because she had told him the story about the manager steal pills and my maintenance guy makes a joke that he'd ask to buy them.  We laugh and then start talking about how his brother just died and he's trying to figure out to get him cremated. I know someone people who know what to do. So I tell him I'm gonna look it up for him. An hour later I knock on the door to a unit he's remodeling and have all the  details he needs to have his brother cremated. Dude gives me a big hug and cries. Let me paint you a picture of this man. He's maybe about 5'10, thick grayish blond beard, bandana, rides a beautiful red bike not sure the maker, and he's friends with hells angels. But he will give you the shirt off his back or he'll shoot the shit with you, and he loves kids and his wife has authored a children's story. He also is a smart ass who sends his ex child support of $666 every month. I fucking adore this guy! I've known him for 4+ years. He asks me if he owes me anything  aka ""pills"". I tell him no, that I'm ok right now but if ever comes a time where I need to buy some maybe he can help.  This last week I needed to get some, sure enough my guy comes through and helps me out. Makes a joke not to tell anyone, I tell him you don't tell on me I won't snitch on you 😉 he catches my husband in passing a lil later and asks if we have any coffee. I walk my lil ass over there with steaming hot coffee and some creamer. He asks me again if he owes us anything. I tell him, ""no, We're friends and you don't owe us anything. I don't charge my friends. But keep me updated on the situation with your brother, because I care."" 
I kid you not, the next day he knocks on my door and hands me a signed copy of the book his wife wrote. I already absolutely love it!

So kids, that's how I met another connect 😘😘😘

They put it in a pipe that was made of tin foil and passed it around, saying you only need 2 hits. When it was finally my turn, I️ hit the tin foil pipe and it was exactly like  weak DMT.

Suboxone has a habit of forming an extremely fast tolerance and the benefits do not last and you will constantly have to go up. This is what the doctor wants. I take my dose every 1-2 days as it has an extremely long half life and gets me by through withdrawl for at least up to 4 days.

Secondly less is more. If you want to feel good (not necessarily high) but GOOD stick within the range of 1-3mg as this allows more the antagonist effects to be more present allowing its positives to be felt much stronger and for some people like myself to get even anti depressant/anti anxiety properties out of this medication

Lastly do not let the doctor determine your schedule or sucker you in. Your recovery is up to you and the steps you take to get better are on your time depend on how YOU feel. Remember that majority of these doctors are pharma slaves and want to as i say ""pharmafuck"" you.

It makes it always feel like I get 2 distinct rushes off of every dose: the first when I snort a few nice bumps of ECP, which is pretty high quality (I have a very low tolerance) and the second when I take a few nice bong rips an hour or so later. 


It's almost funny how amazing synergistic they are, usually when I smoke weed on dope, I basically just feel even higher on dope with a slight touch of that weed psychedelia, which is a really nice addition to heroin's otherwise not trippy euphoria. 


Actually the way I sometimes describe heroin to people is ""if you could isolate the euphoric component of weed, and amplify that while taking away the psychedelia, that would be heroin."" I've always felt weed euphoria, in it's purest sense, is very similar to opiate euphoria. Cannabinoids actually are opioid receptor positive allosteric modulators too so this isn't just something I'm making up. 


Anyway I have to have weed every single time I have dope, but then again I have to have weed all the time anyway. I'm a weed addict first and foremost. An opiate addict is something secondary to that and always has been for some reason.

My response:","You get into a serious medical emergency. You need surgery and won't be able to walk again for the rest of your life without excruciating pain. You're prescribed pain medication for several years and it helps. But after a few years you start to notice you keep upping your dosage. You have to take more and more in order to feel better. 

Sometimes you forget your pills at home and start to feel like you're catching the flu within 12 hours of not taking them. 

You go to your doctor and tell them the medicines not working anymore and that something needs to change. And then the doctor tells you that he can't give you anymore pain medication. The government is cracking down on overprescribing to prevent black market sales so they have to cut your prescription. 

You go home that night in a panic. You have a life. A job. A home. A family. Bills. How will you work without your pain meds to help you through your day? 

Within 24 hours you're experiencing the worst flu of your life. Your entire body is hot and cold at the same time. Your back and legs feel like they've been shattered apart with sledgehammers. You're vomiting constantly. You can't eat or drink for days. Your skin feels like it's crawling around your body.

Then one of your friends messages you. Hey I have something that will make you feel better, it's heroin. It's the same thing that's in pain medications it's just a stronger version. 

You, laying there in agony at 3 am after 4 days of not sleeping more than 25 minutes. Dehydrated and unable to eat a drop of food. 

""I'll feel better? I can go back to work? I won't lose my job? My pain will go away?"" 
You accept, and your friend shows up shortly afterwards. 

You try it. 

Suddenly within seconds. You're able to eat. You feel like you could sleep for days. You call your work to let them know you'll for sure be there in the morning. You crawl out of bed. The sun is shining. Your skin is warm. Nothing has ever made you feel so happy. So great in your entire life. 

You eat a big dinner with your family, kiss your wife good night. And then wake up again the next morning feeling the exact same way you did before. 

You told your work you'd be there. If you miss today you're certainly going to be fired. Your stomach in knots. Your back radiating pain harder than you've ever experienced in your life. 

You call your friend again. 

""I need more of that. That drug. It helped me. It made me feel better. I have to work today. If I don't I can't pay my bills everything will fall apart."" 

""Okay,"" he says. ""Be there in 15."" 

You count the minutes pass. Each second seems like a minute. Each minute an hour. Every second that passes you feel worse and worse. 

He gets there. You score. You take more heroin. You feel better. Your doctor won't give you more pain meds. Your body can't function without this drug. Heroin fixes this problem. You need it. You start being unable to afford it. Your wife finds a needle. She leaves with the kids. You go through detox. You relapse. Your wife divorces you. Your family disowns you. 

You just want to feel better. Heroin makes you feel better. 

You're homeless. Your wife and kids are gone. Your job is gone. Everything's gone except heroin. 

Your doctor prescribed you medications and got you hooked without you being fully educated then took it away from you. Your body cant function without that drug. You just wanted to feel better. You just wanted to not be sick. You just wanted to be normal. Now you've lost everything. Your entire life is gone. All you have is heroin.

We were sitting there, just talking, over a jack/coke sitting at the bar, killing time until it was time to throw the lines for them. He was one of my best friends in high school, we spent a lot of time that night reminiscing over those times. 
We get back to the boat, get our minds right & just continue to talk, laugh & bullshit around. Around 11, we jumped over to a different boat & done some of this random guy we just mets coke. After sitting there for a few hours, we decided it was time to part ways and get them out of the harbor. The last image I have of him is looking into his eyes & telling them to have a safe trip, tight lines. He said I love you bro, I'll call you when we come in to pack out. 

I never knew that 24 hours later, a 50 pound block, hanging 30 feet above the deck, was going to hit him in the head, killing him instantly. This is why it's called deadliest catch. While t.v. portrays it to be the PNW crab fishery, it's actually all east coast fisheries. Shrimp, ground fish & sea scallops are the top 3. Not only does the water want to kill you, the equipment we use does too. This is what you don't hear about. It's not all drugs, money & pretty scenes. While he died doing what he loved, it's still tragic that he did. Even though we understand there is a risk of us not coming back, we always figure it will be from our boat going down, not our equipment. 

To the many lines we did, the fish and shrimp we caught, the beers we drank, the laughs we shared, cheers brother, I love you. Rest in peace.

I put it in quotation marks because 5 years later I still have a hard time believing she would  have taken that many morphine. She had  been on pain meds over half her life due to a horribly  painful genetic  disorder  she had, Ellers Danlos syndrome,  that made her connective tissue like bubble gum, instead of like a rubber band,  like it should have been. I lost count of how many times I had to pop her dislocated shoulder back in, or her finger (s). It was horribly  painful for her, and she was on opana for it. 
But yet she died from an overdose of her boyfriend's  morphine pills, what was termed ""30 times the therapeutic dose"" in her body. 
2 weeks after she died, her boyfriend moved her skanky babysitter in (the babysitter  was a minor when  my bestie died, the boyfriend  literally moved the whore in ON her 18th  birthday). I just can't let go of the feeling of how shady  and fucked  up it is that the only 2 people who know what really happened-the  boyfriend and the babysitter-hooked up right after she died. My bestie was on Opana for fuck sake, she would never  have wasted time taking his morphine.  I talked to her the night before she died , she asked if I knew anyone that would buy any, but she even said that she knew chances were slim anyone would. (This was at the peak of the pain pill influx,  before a lot of ppl switched to heroin).
I'll never forget waking up that Sunday to my phone ringing,  it was my besties sister,  so I silenced it and rolled back over. When she called back and left a message,  I got up to check it. 
The message said ""It's Jessica, please call me. Lindsy is dead"".
That's all I remember.  My mom said she heard me start screaming and I hit the floor. It was a nightmare,  a horribly  real nightmare.  
In the 6 days between when  she died and her funeral I took over 100 bars, just to keep myself moving and to try to not lose it completely.  
It's been 5years but it feels like it was yesterday.  She was my best friend,  I lost a piece of myself that day. I know she would be so pissed to see the addiction I ended up with, but after she died I went from selling pills, to eating them. 
I'm not sure why I shared this...I just miss her SO fucking much
 Been crying all day. I hate this week. Fuck Thanksgiving.  Think I'll go do a shot. 
Everyone call your best friend RIGHT NOW and tell them you love them, please. You might not get another chance. I wish I had one more chance to tell her.

Not only that, but it's (knocks on wood to prevent jinxing himself) not even addictive IV compared to JUST ORAL OXY. And I'm not even talking about snorted oxy just oral.

Hydrocodone breaks down in the body to hydromorphone and even though you cannot IV pure hydrocodone you can IV it's metabolite.

Got a good night's sleep from like 12:30am to 1020am and woke up and slammed 8mg dilaudid and boy was the rush so amazing. The stronger your dose the stronger AND longer the rush.

Then the high is just like a cleaner version of hydrocodone with some of the slight itchiness and euphoria of morphine but not the dirtier High morphine has.

I guarantee in this forum everyone either defends to life either dope or oxycodone and some will say well oxymorphone is cooler but let's be honest, dilaudid and hydrocodone feel the same except hydromorphone can be IVd and has the best rush.

You know how everyone says they started with hydrocodone and can't really feel it anymore and that hydrocodone was the best High they had at first? Well try IV dilaudid for a few days and you'll get that same feeling back and more. 

Oxycodone has a high that is best snorting d and feels like a kind of stronger, noddier, but paradoxically speedy high that makes you unable to sleep and does give you energy and definitely takes pain away very good. You cannot cum on it at all. The high however is very mental and literally takes control and can even change your attitude or behavior. It's also amazingly addictive and cravings to do more is high. And the high is I wouldn't say dirty but doesn't feel clean either. It honestly is closer to heroin than hydrocodone.

But dilaudid is just like Hydrocodone with the BEST RUSH compared to any opiate including heroin and while the high lasts like 3-4 yours you have to do higher doses for more length.

I love waking up knowing I don't even have to do it anyway it's just not as mentally and psychologically addictive like oxycodone or heroin. Plus it got me off blues and much  better than the most garbage opiate ever, suboxone.

Anyway who else here love IV Dilaudid? Anyone else notice the similarity in feeling between hydrocodone and dilaudid? It's the same warm, natural, contentment body high which allows you to function in your mind as if you were sober plus even 16mg dilaudid give it 2-3 hours and I can still cum huge on my irlfriend without effort.

With oxycodone I didn't cum for weeks. Just fuking 30mg of it I could not cum for like 8 hours because it literally hijacks your brain control of your orgasm..

So, i wrote a... well, a depressing post a while ago and a lot of you kinda talked me through it and talked me out of it, and i wanted to say thanks

I know i come here sometimes to talk bad shit with you guys... I don't want to explain why i talk the bad shit, not unless someone PM's me because i honestly do not want to upset anyone.

You're all amazing people, high or sober... 

So, this is the emotional/Corny part, so stop reading unless you wanna see pure sappyness

I'm an amateur MMA fighter, and some people know of my struggle with chronic pain, and painkiller use (which im sure alot of people here are very well aware of). If there was a way that i could help everyone here, whether it's through free suboxone (i got a bunch incase i wish to stop my painkiller use, which i am unable to), or just someone to talk to.

My goal in life was to make it to the UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship), and i promised my (now dead, RIP Grandma) grandma that i would make her proud... If i make big money, then i want to make a way to give out free suboxone to those that need it (im very uneducated with opiates, so if i said anything misleading or wrong, feel free to correct or berate me.).

I've had so many friends die due to opiates (I live in melbourne, we have a problem with opiates), and it can sometimes hurt to come here and see people inject and stuff.. but i suppose life shouldn't revolve around what i want to see.

Thank you everyone, i love you all, you're all amazing people, please, please stay safe.

Also Setraline question insi,"So, went to the dr trying to get him to prescribe me some gabapentin for depression and anxiety because it helps massively. Makes me feel great, happy, talkative, mentally strong and positive.  I've been feeling depressed for about 7-8 years since i was 19-20 but have never done anything about it because i wasn't really sure if i was depressed or not. 

Like probably most on here that was the huge attraction to opiates because they take away the depression etc and leave me feeling happy and content. Anyway i so go in and explain my symptoms and ask about Gaba script, to which he became instantly defensive and dismissive. I explained i had a friend of who was given it by his Dr, along with some other things for his depression. He gave me a couple to try and it really helped! I thought i had found the solution. So I explain all this, but he was a total dickhead and really rude. tried to play it off like they don’t prescribe it for that when i know for a fact they do. Anyway he left me with a 2 week script for an anti depressant which i’m not sure about taking. He kept trying to rush me out of his office too when i wasn't done talking or asking questions.

After getting up and thanking and saying goodbye, he didn't respond and instead just slammed the door in my face. So i complained about him to the reception and had them make a note to never have me see that Dr again. 

Its sertraline he gave me FYI. I've always been unsure about SSRI's because you hear of people having crazy side effects and the fact that it takes months to come off once you are on because they have to do a very slow taper. Anyone have any experience with this?

Anyway, is there any advice on how to get myself a gaba script? Its like i'm being forced to go back to deep web to get what i need, when i should be able to get it from my doc when i describe the ways it helps massively.

Sorry for the long post, but i would appreciate any feedback or thoughts!

I found out weed wasn't bad, and that cigarettes short term weren't that bad, so I assumed the same went for heroin.","
I never learned the difference between soft and hard drugs. Educating children on this is so important. We often do what we're told not to do but maybe if we learned in detail the psychological effects and PAWS that opiate addiction can cause, it would be a deterrent. Because it's not like the movies (5 days of WD then you're Gucci) nope! 

My curiosity often trumps my fear. I feel like I was doomed. Granted my ex (who was an excellent chipper, part of the 1% as I like to call them) introduced me. (Heroin found me not the reverse, it's the only detail in my story that I'm sort of proud of that I always mention, it gets me a little sympathy, pathetic and twisted eh?) My naïveté was the reason I didn't ""just say no"". Education is so important. These stigmatized subjects such as drugs, mental health and sex are the ones we should discuss the most. How did you encounter heroin?

Also seriously what kind of piece of shit introduces someone to opiates just fuuuck. If you've done this you gotta at least regret it. 

At the end of the day it was my mistake my decision and I'm a stupid ass.  And sure I'm having a bit of a pity party and it was my fault blah blah but I think it's interesting to explore the reasons we make the decisions that we make. But we do not *start out* as a junkie.

 Most of the time we don't one day wake up and watch a movie with drug content and be like ""fuck yeah I wanna be like THAT"" Then put on a grungy outfit ( or like ghetto ass hood ensemble that comes with guns that you never use [but constantly threaten to use on people]and complimentary fake gangster accent)then proceed to blast nirvana (or rap whatever your personal preference may be) while driving through the hood, cop, laugh maniacally like we don't care about anything, then shoot up in a McDonald's parking lot. 🙄 if this is your story then I don't even know what to say. 

Short story: we have to educate our children about WHY drugs are bad and the huge difference between soft and hard drugs. I didn't have this luxury. No one starts off as a junkie no one is ""just a junkie"" or inherently bad. I don't know I'm stoned ",1511373924.0

I've done this before, so I'm not completely naive about the game, and I'm usually very cautious. 

I got an order from someone I've known for some time, who knows almost everyone I know who uses. He told me he had $40 and gas money (because when I deliver I charge for gas money). 

It took me some time to get to him because it was rush hour and I'm in a major city. He wasn't where he usually is, but a few miles further out. 

When I arrived, everything was normal. He hopped into the front passenger side of my car and told me where to take him (just inside the gate of an apartment complex). 

He started going through his pockets, looking for his cash. He pulled out a dollar and said, ""I have more,"" looked a bit more, pulled out an envelope with some change in it, and poured the change all over the center console in my car. Then he pulled out a large silver coin and said, ""This is about $30."" I looked at it, but I knew I couldn't take it. So after a minute or so, he says, ""I'm gonna need that 40."" I tell him I'm not keeping his coin, so I can't give him the piece. 

I put in a call to my plug, with him sitting in my car. I didn't want there to be any doubt that I had actually asked if they would take the coin. They told me if he wanted to go to a pawn shop and then buy the piece, that would be fine, but no way was I to take this coin as payment. I hung up the phone and told him what they told me. He didn't get out of my car, and I was just about to say, ""Okay, I need to go,"" when out came the knife. 

Before I had a chance to react, his arm was around my neck and there was a blade being held to my throat. He said, ""I'm gonna need that 40. I got you tomorrow. Is that okay?"" and I said, ""Yes...it's fine."" because what other option did I have? I handed him a cigarette pack with the piece in it, he got out of my car, and walked away. 

I was stunned. I didn't know what to do, other than to get out of there, so even though I was shaking and crying, I started to drive back toward my house. 

I know this dude uses reddit, and I know almost every junkie in town knows him. I'm just not sure how to get the word out that he is not some innocent kid who can be trusted or is deserving of sympathy. He's a fucking monster who will hurt you over a very small amount of drugs. 

Oh, and of course he never paid me the $40. So not only did he cause me emotional trauma and physical harm (a small knick to the neck from his knife blade), but he also fucked up my finances.

So now I have this incredibly shitty disease called [empty nose syndrome](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1879729612000312)

I have ongoing incredible pain from breathing and this frightening and insidious feeling of suffocation. These feelings never go away and get worse when I exert myself. 

Opiates help me cope, so I take them now. Without this medication I probably would have killed myself earlier this year. The pain is unimaginable. 

I'm scared when I hear about placing new regulations on prescription pain killers, or when healthcare providers label people ""drug seeking"" or tell me ""opiates are the wrong medication"" for empty nose syndrome, even though there is no medication and no cure, and it's the only thing that helps. 

I feel like I have to constantly take fiber rich foods to avoid constipation too.

Anyway, I'm suffering pretty bad and I'm glad I have access to these drugs. The medical industry is just so corrupt and dangerous, I almost can't believe it. 

I'm glad I'm alive, but if I didn't have these medications I wouldn't want to be. Every breathe hurts and every activity that makes me breathe harder exponentially increases my pain.

Anyway monkey water is my preferred ROA and this last pick up is going to be my last before I get on subs. Well I'm disappointed as shit because I only have one dboy and he stopped selling tar completely a few days ago and only has powder now. This normally wouldn't be a problem but the powder is trash. It keeps withdrawals away but the high is nothing compared to the tar. I get so fucking sleepy after railing a line too. Like it has to be cut with a looooot of benedryl. I'm disappointed obviously because I wanted to pick up some great tar before getting clean and get high as shit but now I'm stuck with benadryl cut with a small amount of heroin. It's really confusing too because his tar was fire so you would assume the powder would be too but somehow someway it's a dumpster fire. It makes me sad because the powder looks great, like a nice bag of brown sugar. 

I guess I should be happy I have any dope at all. Sorry for the rant y'all just gotta get the frustration out. I have no one else to talk to about this shit.

I found myself buying a crafting blade last night with intentions of cutting. 

I don't know why I went back. I haven't had urges in years. Im not going to make it a problem though. I'm completely off my meds (antidepressant and mood stabilizer) and have been for about three weeks now. I think I'm starting to feel the effects of that, leading me to  this. I got into a fight with  someone I care about, love maybe. I was told I'd   my stuff back and then we wouldn't talk or see each other anymore. I panic. We apologize. We understand we're both half asleep. I take blame for freaking out. I wanted to talk about it but he falls asleep. 

I'm alone.

I rail my last four bags at once. Never done so many like that. I don't feel pain  now, it's been about ten minutes. I dismantled a razor and I accidentally sliced the tip of my finger getting it out. I feel nothing. I run the blade across my arm. I think I'm on the wrong side because I feel nothing. But then the line becomes white, and red, filling with blood
.
This is similar to registering your shot in a sick way. You watch the ident of pressure on your arm either stay the same (which indicates the actual blade side was not used) or fill and bead up with blood.

It just didn't hurt. Usually it stings as the skin tears, usually it hurts. That's dimorphine for you. That could be dangerous though. I had no way of knowing or feeling how feel deep I'm going


I'm nodding out and dripping sweat. I'm mostly likely going to throw up-

firstly, this chat is not affiliated with this subreddit or its moderators, and has its own moderators, rules, and etiquette. if you feel someone there has slighted you take it up with the moderators of tinychat, as it is completely unaffiliated with and not endorsed by this or any other subreddit.  
just a reminder and an announcement that a bunch of your fellow degenerate junkies, chippers, and tourists hang out in [our very own tinychat room](http://tinychat.com/ropiatesubchat) which has been an ongoing tradition for something like four years now. the location, for those who can't do links for whatever reason, is http://tinychat.com/ropiatesubchat.  

tinychat is an extremely buggy videochat client, but also the only one that fills its particular niche---that being, anyone who knows the room name may enter, and it has a youtube player. any technical difficulties may be addressed by the moderator, namely me. we like to hang out, listen to music, talk about random shit, and lately have even had our own resident sketch artist who draws random crap upon request. the primary purposes for the room's existence are companionship and harm reduction---it's nice to be able to shoot up with others around, even if you are technically alone in the non-digital sense, and have people keeping an eye on you. we're also glad to help with any problems you might be having, or questions you might need answered. we aim to be a welcoming, friendly space for the members of this subreddit to do what we do in good company without judgement. so stop by if you are bored, or just need to talk.  

if it appears like there is a moderator in the room but who is not speaking, just type a few sentences to summon them back. if you are on mobile it is not immediately apparent that there is anyone in the room. either click the button shaped like an outline of a person (i think) to see the list, or say hello to see if anyone responds.  


rules:  

1. pick a unique username. this is to protect other users so we know who is who, given the nature of the sort of activities we enjoy. 

2. no lurking. again, to protect the other users. if you come in the room be prepared to introduce yourself and participate for at least a few minutes so we know you're not up to any shenanigans. if you are lurking you will be warned and then given a generous ten minutes to announce yourself. if the time runs out, you will be kicked (not banned) until you are ready to come in and actually participate. if you are a known member whose identity can be confirmed, this rule is not applicable.  

3. no -isms or hate speech, even accidental. one warning will be issued, any continued insistence on such behavior will result in a ban. bans can be contested by pm'ing a moderator (me). this includes but is not limited to racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia. for example, if you are not black, use of the n-word, even with the -a ending, will not be tolerated. i don't care if your friend down the block lets you say it, it's not your lane. 

4. no auditory fuckery. due to peculiarities of the transmission of sound over a chat, certain echos and effects can be amplified to the point of being severely distressing. if it is determined that your end is causing an echo you will be asked to use headphones, or to mute your microphone when not speaking. deliberately making strange or unpleasant noises to annoy other chatters will not be tolerated, and your broadcast will be closed. (this only means that your video/audio feed will be terminated--you will still be allowed to type.)  

i know the rules seem like a lot but there's really only four of them, and only two that pertain to just behaving in a manner that isn't dickish.

I'm finally going to get my life back, right? Ha, no! Turns out that stuff triggers horrific migraines. The doctor acted like I was speaking a foreign language when I tried to explain-- I didn't start having multi-day, 10/10, head's about to explode migraines like this till I started suboxone, so it seemed simple enough-- but I think he thought I just wanted to quit the program, and he encouraged me to keep doing the medicine. So I, stupidly, listened.

I finally had enough on the week of Halloween and cut myself off. I went through the w/d's at home with no support. But I was finally free of those awful migraines, though I still had chronic headaches every day. In my experience these would get better as my tolerance went down.

Cravings are still an issue though, so I decide to try an old friend: kratom. It tastes vile, but it's cheap and it doesn't give me awful headaches. So I buy a bag, thinking hey, two weeks off suboxone means I probably have the tolerance of an infant and can start at a low dose.

Imagine my surprise when I needed 9 grams just to get some slight relief!

So I took a week off, again. Now three weeks off suboxone, surely all will be well... Nope, I still need 9 grams of kratom just to feel a smidgen of a buzz.

I am frustrated and defeated. Three weeks of no opiates and I feel like I have nothing to show for it. Is this normal??? Do I just have a naturally high tolerance or something??

Is there any way to make this process move faster? I've tried agmatine in the past but I've never had much luck with it. ",1511478189.0

So any one have any advice on how to get what I need from them or experience with similar events.

Once the plunger hit the bottom boom. A rush so strong like a full body orgasm to the point I was moaning loud and hard because the experience felt do good and just like an orgasm but 50 times better and longer.

It literally kept on lasting for 5 minutes just an intense amazing great rush. I was in the canyon parked on the rocks in privacy in my BMW M4 and 2 minutes in the rush I started driving and driving a fast and beautiful car fast (but safely) felt amazing. Plus I found 2 other sexy cars just racing like it was the track on the canyons, a BMW M2 and a Porsche Cayman GT4 I think and I turned around and followed them.

The music was in too and what a blissful experience. Better than any fucking thing and no cravings after for more like oxy. I feel just fine in the mind unlike oxy where it is a mental high as well and fuks u up and makes u crave more.

Dilaudid in my book is number #1. The high is so clean, the rush so amazingly strong and long and feels just like hydrocodone probably the most content, enlightened, euphoric opiate out of them all. Gives you a great mood lift that's natural and doesn't feel synthetic and speedy and fuks with your mind like oxy.

I first came here after combing various internet resources on what I could expect during my first experience with opiate withdrawal. Months later I found this place to be one of the more valuable resources. A lot of my access has been motivated by selfishness, err self-interest and desire to avoid any level of suffering. 


Beyond that, I've utilized this place as a place to vent while sharing stories for other people's amusement which revolved around me getting scammed or otherwise being disenfranchised by the game. Some of the content was enjoyed by readers but I'm sure a lot of it belongs in a blog. On occasion, I've seized the opportunity of a good mood and creativity to share the occasional Anime or Star Trek GIF and look forward to continuing to do so. 


&nbsp;


Before getting into this shit, I staunchly judged others for being grubby ""pill poppers"" and hated addicts with the highest level of prejudice. Nowadays I can empathize but even I've been driven to wit's end with my ""running partner."" In a way, it's good that I've had encountered a lot of negative experiences in procuring dope through my ""friend"" who is frequently my only middle. Perhaps if my experiences in using dope went better and it was all easier... I'd be more of an addict out of convenience. 


&nbsp;

I'm grateful that I've never IV'ed, am grateful for this place and the nicer people here and even appreciate some of the mean people. 


Last Christmas I was posting about using a spreadsheet to track my dope inventory so that I wouldn't be dopesick when visiting my relatives. This Christmas I hope to be in recovery with the aide of medical professional. I look forward to having money to buy gifts for everyone and look forward to no longer being vulnerable to schemes designed to poach what's left of my money. 


I'm grateful that I did not share the Suboxone that I procured this week with my lying ""friend"". Without it, I don't know if I would've been able to perform at work during the week leading up to black Friday. Theoretically I could've gotten through the worst of dope sickness and been adequately fine to work today but I'm glad that I didn't have to chance it and find out the hard way.


&nbsp;


Finally I'm grateful that I don't have to experience this cold weather in withdrawal on twelve hour work days in a retail setting.


Good luck to all, stay safe, stay well, or if not well.. stay strong.

Quick tidpoint, though I know you are not allowed to post locations, my brother & I live near a major city with an open market. My brother's blood test came back with ONLY FENTANYL recorded. Meaning all the ""dope"" bags he had been buying had NOTHING BUT FENT in it. 

Anyway, he went into detox. After around 24 hours he felt fairly sick, so they were ready to dose him with subutex. This is where I feel like the detox center screwed up. Instead of giving him a small dose like 2mg and dosing him every few hours they decided to give him 16mg! He instantly went into precipitated withdrawal. He was losing it in the detox center they took him to the hospital where the hospital gave him a meager .5mg Ativan (lol)....He went through absolute horror. The next day they gave him 14mg, another huge dose, he started feeling worst again. It got to the point where he couldn't take it any longer and left. I picked him up, scored, and he felt fine. Just think, the fent he is buying off the street had no problem beating the sub blocker. 

Is it possible that fentanyl is such a strong drug that subutex/suboxone doesn't touch it? I guess if he would have somehow had the courage to stick through it he would have eventually been able to start feeling better, but I don't know anyone who has the ability to stick through precipitated fentanyl withdrawal.

So I just got hold of a bunch of packets containing Suboxone 8 mg/2 mg sublingual film.
I pop some oxynorm and oxycontin maybe a couple times a month, about 35-40 mg's at the time. So I got basically zero opioid tolerance.
Now, I know Suboxone is some really serious stuff, and if your are not careful your going to basically throw up the next 36 hours (or so I was told).
My question is, how much should I take for a first times? Should I cut a small piece of the strip/paper and place it under my tongue? 
- and what will my high be like compared to oxy? All advice is welcomed, since my only experience with opioids is kodein, tramadol, oxy, morphine and contalgin.

Halfway through this last gram I realized how fucked I was, sleeping too much, breaK was ending, realized it was turning into a habit, etc. I’ve done opiates before (hydros Oxys etc but I never had a stable enough connect to get hooked) I deleted the plugs ## and hope to kick this habit, every time I’m more than 8 hours in I feel something along the lines of major grumpy or insomnia as fuck and rail a line. I ran through all my tar by turning it into cheese and up the nose, recently this last .3 g I’ve been just taking a point and diluting it and up the nose like money water to get a buzz and warm taper. I know when I’m out of this I’m pretty fucked on withdrawal symptoms but starting this made me stop my xan habit, alcohol, marijuana, still do drums sometimes but rarely as often... lol poly drug abuse to this one thing. Kinda hoping this is just another phase but this reposing thing is worrying me.

I am not a user nor have I ever been habitually. I have many friends who have had addiction problems and have successfully battled back from addiction. I have no judgement against anyone here I️ enjoy seeing all your posts and pictures of your pills and powder. I come to you with a question. 

When did all these pressed pills become rampant? I️t seems like back around 06-09 when my friends were offering me lines of oxy, there wasn’t a scare of fentanyl I️t seems back then.  When did this become more of a thing you guys had to worry about? 

I personally had a kidney stone and had fentanyl at the urgent care and I️t was nothing compared to the morphine they gave me after the fentanyl didn’t do a good job. The only way i ever heard of I️t was my friends buying patches back in the day of I️t. Now it seems rampant.  Is this something you all are worrying about or is I️t some sort of added bonus that has been added into pressed pills.

I got to thinkin of the past and how my first introduction to opiates (heroin specifically) was at the exact same evening I lost my virginity (same girl hooked me up) 10+ years ago back in high school. 

Since then whenever I use I get spontaneous erections that I dont necessarily want to do anything with (it can kind of be a nuisance in day to day life). On the other hand spontaneous erections never happen when im sober and even with a pretty girl I have to pump at it to get it going.

 It seems that due to my first experience with heroin being tied to my first sexual experience my brain has decided its gonna be the pills, rocks and powders that turn me on and the women come second. Since then ive been in good relationships with women I found attractive and had a good sex life etc but it always ends with me hiding out in the washroom tellin my girl I got diareeha while im realling puttin somethin up my nose

So anyone else find theyre more turned on by opiates then people or get the same thing when using? It can be inconvenient but amusing at times I suppose esp when going under for surgery then waking up to a stack of towels covering your groin area and the nurses being super nice to you.

For the past two years I have been taking 4 Norco 10's a day. I had a doctor who recently retired and now I am being sent to a pain clinic.

I would like to stop taking the norco's and move to something extended release. This is great for me because I am a paraplegic with 5 vertabre spinal fusion and chronic pain surrounding my t9-t11. Being that I have tried every type of pain pill or IV (Dilaudid, Morpheine, Oxy, Opana, etc.) As a person who uses them correctly, I feel that I have information as to what works and what does not. For example, I could take 15mg or Morpheine and not have the same relief as 1mg Dilaudid. I can take 1 1/2 Norco and not have as much relief as a perc.  I am concerned that I will walk in and they will completely shit on my 2 years of prescriptions and sent me out with 3 7.5's a day. 

I wish I would get Oxycontin 2x a day for the amount that would be sufficient, but I dont know what that is.

Is a 20mg Oxycontin sustained 20mg in the bloodstream for an extended time, or is it like 5mg ever 4 hours. Is there a place to figure this out

Regardless, It seems like these places give you what they give you and fuck you if you dont like it. I went to them post injury and they sent me home with 2 5's a day. I had been taking 30mg MScontin 15mg Oxycodones breakthrough, granting it was still acute pain from trauma. It felt like such a slap in the face that I never went back.

So is there any literature or information I can look at on what extended pills actually do? What to say and not to say at the DR (Im used to just tell them what I know and saying ""I am not a doctor, I only know the things that helped in this specific time."" which probably isnt a good idea. Im 31 and dont want to ruin my liver with acetaminophen, and Im pretty tight on keeping my pills because if I dont have them, I dont get out of bed. ANd it has nothing to do with being dopesick, I physically hurt.

Recently I was given 2mg IV Dilaudid and I finally understand what all the fuss is about. That was the best feeling I have ever had next to sex with no pull out in a dime piece. My whole body felt different but it was for such a short amount of time, I just dont get that part. I don't have circles that could get heron or any other crazy shit, and I dont know the dark web so no thanks. Im just saying I can see how that could become a problem if you had a huge ass bottle of it. Only thing is Ive never shot up and my viens are so bad it couldnt if i tried. I am forced to get a picc line any time i stay in a hospital. My Doc messed up one day and gave me 4mg dillies IV before a 4 hour ambulance drive to a spine center... IT took 15 minutes and aparently I smoked my vape in it without giving a fuck. I was ruined for the next 36 hours.



Im rambling because the 1 mg dillaudid i am on is making me chatty. SO In summery

A person who takes 40mg Hydrocodone daily would benefit from what mg Oxycontin twice a day. Some asshole said 30 mg Oxys would eliminate the pain and allow me to stay in my wheelchair longer that 3 1/2 hr to 5 hrs depending.

Until very recently I had the same view of hard drug users that my parents instilled in me. I viewed anyone and everyone who used heroin, pills, meth, etc. as a lowly piece of scum who deserved to die. Since browsing r/o (admittedly only found y'all a couple days ago, but I browsed the sub for several hours, until way past when I meant to go to sleep) I've come to realize that most users aren't pieces or trash, and are in fact humans, just like myself.

I find myself relating to a lot of the posts here about just wanting to get away from life, to escape reality if you will. I used to do the same thing via inhalents, weed, and self harm. Now I do it with alcohol occasionally (when I can afford it). 

I'm also seeing that a lot of y'all use out of necessity, and seeing this sub promote using safely is incredibly uplifting to be perfectly honest.

So thank you r/o for changing my opinion of a very large group of people, and making me realize that that's exactly what y'all are, *people*.

Have a great night r/o, and stay safe out there.

A couple years ago, one user shared the following OP abuse technique with me... It's also done as the ""MICROWAVE METHOD,"" but microwaves burn the fuck out of it unevenly. So do ovens. This method doesn't.

Grind OP on metal file. Spread evenly over aluminum foil. Hover foil over candle, piece by piece, until it baaaaaaaaarely turns light brown or golden. Do to all the OP shavings. Scrape it off. Abuse it.

*I've never seen that method ANYWHERE else, only on a comment reply to my small-time thread with less than 10 upvotes.*

With that being said, maybe some of you guys and gals know of good ways to abuse OP OxyContin. Below are the methods I know of:

* **chew like bubble gum for long ass time**
* **grind with dremel or metal file**
* **""Coca Cola method,"" or use acidic drink**
* **grind, candle melt, viola, magic**
* **microwave method, same as above but above doesn't burn the shit like microwaves and ovens**

Does anybody have any tried-and-true methods to abuse OP?

Yesterday, very excited pop 2 of this, and felt almos nothing. What the fuck? Was I thinking to myself. Then I found out that what you call ""bars"" are 2mg of alprazolam. So I increased my dose to aprox. 3-4 mg, can't remember exactly. And wow, if you stay awake, is similar to a dope high. Your mind wanders from subject to subject, I have yo close an eye to keed focus on reading, overall a great experience.

Thats what happened to my boy Mike. I lived because one of my four ""friends,"" the one still by my side now had the balls to touch the gross throwing up mess of a 14 or 15 year old. My boy Mike he didn't have that. He got kicked out an after party at his best friends house because of his heroin use,  mike was addicted to a nice fake xannax, cocaine combo and then eventually the ol speedball combo. The use was so short before it killed him I never got to ask why he swtiched from the xans to heroin, what kinda rigs he used, if he snorted. Such fucked up questions to want to ask, yet im still here . He just  went home, got just a little more high. Just a little more wont hurt. We've all been there. Somtimes that little bit extra before you pass out has you waking up in the middle of the night knowing you are going to throw up, and that if you hadnt gotten up to throw it up an a never gotten up again. And sometimes you dont wake up. You choke on your vomit until youre dead. Id imagine you know what's happening, distantly,fadingly, maybe wishing for it to end. That's what happend to him. My own fathter being a paramedic had to see the poor kid on his back white as a fucking ghost blank eyed, covered in his throw up, dead as fuck. His own father had to find him. Any day that could be my poor father. Had the find his own fucking son dead in his bssement. Nothing he can ever due to change it. Oh the guilt that man must feel. I'll never forget my father calling me at work""do you know mike blankname..."" It was like getting tackeld by an nfl player. Never knew somone that died before him, I was real young you know. Especially for what we where into. Never expecred the next thing he'd tell me was that the dude I had looked up to from age 14 and on was dead. Dead of the addiction I too had instilled into me, a kindergarten version of the endless banging fent dope that I call life now. This was bout two years ago by now, still think of the dude often. One of the nicest mother fuckers you ever met swear to fucking god. You dont meet people like him in this game, or fucking anywhere. Why the fuck did i derserve to be flipped over, simple thing really, all that needed to be done was somome flip him over. But it wasnt fucking done. And that's it. His friends made their decision to leave, or Mike left on his own I guess I'll never know. Regardless he's gone. And I'm not.  And I've realized that can eat me away like maggots  on roadkill over why It wasnt me. Or anyone else. But it won't. I understand that this Is just life, it must be coupled with death. Like men and women making a child, living and life create death. We don't all make it as far as others, but no matter how far you get it'll fucking get us all. So why so I live while Mike died? Because thats how it happened. No purpose for his death, no reason for my life to extrend past his other than that I was lucky that my buddy thought it wouldnt be smart to let me throw up on my back. The other three kids thought I'd be fine. I wouldn't be typing this post, and Mike would still be dead. And Ive got to fucking accept that shit like a man. Own that shit, or im going to be dead too. Letting the death and loss and pain be YOU kills you. We simply exist until our time comes, easiest way for me to cope.

No on to the story after realizing i had a pretty bad problem and i didnt want to be a junky i decided that i aughta trade off drugs and move back over to amphetamines and then get off of those because the withdrawls from amps arent anything compared to opiates (physical anyways).

7fmqkx,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7fmqkx/interesting_conversation_with_pain_consultant/,9,https://redd.it/7fmqkx,CaptainEngage,Interesting conversation with pain consultant.,"So I went to the only pain management facility in my area around 2 1/2 years ago shortly after becoming a T10 paraplegic. Upon my visit, I had been subscribed MScontin 30Mg and 15 mg IR Oxy for pain. After visiting this clinic, I left with 3x 7.5 hydrocodone a day. My body was in so much pain and they didn't give a single shit. It was a terrible feeling because I had documented proof of what I was prescribed and was looking for a PMcenter that I could go to. I didn't go back.

After 2 years of getting 4x Hydrocodone 10s a day, My doctor was investigated by the DEA. I am not sure what came of it, but when I returned to the office for a final prescription by the replacement, they told me I was flagged by the DEA for the prescriptions he wrote me. Not for pain, but because Clonazepam is a benzo, and he wouldn't write Ambien but instead Restoril (Temazepam). It sorta pissed me off because I am not a doctor, and didn't even know restoril was a benzo.

While in the hospital, My hospital doctor called for a consult with the same pain clinic that gave me the 7.5s, She came into the room and asked my background. She asked what they could do for me and I said ""I have been getting 10mg Hydrocodone for 2 years at 4x a day and my doctor is no longer in practice so I felt it best to go ahead and build a relationship with the center."" She asked why he wasn't practicing and I explained the story as I did to you. She seems surprised that Hydrocodone was all that I took for pain and said she didn't forsee any issue with it.. Totally different then before. I told her that I have been taking Norco for two years and it is obvious that pain management is something I am going to most likely need for the rest of my life. I said that I was concerned about the amount of acetometaphin I will be consuming over the years because sure, 4 norcos a day isnt bad, but every day for 5 years is going to do serious work on my body. Without skipping a beat she said ""I think you are right. It takes a toll on your whole body, Would you consider trying Oxycodone 10 mg without tylenol."" So basically 10mg IR. We agreed that may be best at 4x a day since I have been having an issue with burning out early with the hydrocodone. I feel like I just won the lottery. I am not one to go insane with my pain pills because each one extra I take is one less I have at the end of the month, but with 10mg IR, this makes me happy for various reasons. Oxycodone effects me different and the buzz when I take 2 is more euphoric than energetic, but as they are IR, they can be broken down for a needle. Now, I dont use needles, but I go to the hospital for recurring UTI issues and various this and get admitted for multiple days, always with an IV. I don't have the skill or interest is using needles, but I damn sure will make some premade ""flushes"" for when I am there. Thats 4x a day I will get from them and have a hope because they give my daily meds while I am there. Im interested to see this play out.

In all honesty, If I do get the 10ir, I will use them like I do my hydrocodone. I dont go overboard, but if I find myself with more than my schedule, I do get a good buzz going. So feels like a win guys.",1511700992.0

Wednesday morning: wake up from previous opiate use (100+mg oxy for the past month). Call my dealer. Patiently wait 30 minutes for him to show up at my apartment (he's a decent guy I respect btw) and I buy the following: 1 morphine 60mg er, 2 OP 30s, 2 M box 30s. That was my final dose. I took that shit all afternoon while smoking weed. It was a great day. It lasted well into the night, and I fell asleep soundly at my parents house.

Thursday: take 2 mg of klonopin over the course of the day, don't nod off or anything at thanksgiving but I did take a nap on the couch with my dog after dinner. Could have passed it off as  normal but I unfortunately drop a gabapentin pill on the floor not a good look. By the end of the day, not feeling wd yet at all.

Friday: wake up, shit storm over the gabapentin pill. Parents very angry, also pissed I spent a lot of money last month. Lectures for hours. It was a miserable day, but only feeling slight wd. I'm out of benzos now and switch to gaba. Friday wds start to kick in hard. I get 3 hours of sleep.

Saturday: okay, now I'm feeling this. At this point I have squandered all my comfort drugs and I'm regretting it. It's bearable during the day, I even went out and about with my dad. But as the day goes on, it's getting more intense. Those er pills really delayed this shit. By the afternoon, I have to keep retreating to my bed room in between family interaction in order to recover. My mom screams at me but surprisingly calms down and helps me complete some applications. I manage to make it to the evening.

Saturday night to Sunday morning: this is the worst wd I've felt yet. I know some of you gram a day guys are gonna call me out, but give me some credit, I spent 1500 on drugs last month. I spent the entirety of last night, from 11pm to 7:00, shivering, sweating, having diarrhea, turning the heat on and off, getting up and down, running downstairs for a drink and an apple, and let me tell you, I was in absolute misery. Can't really describe it but the feeling all over my skin was intense. This was true peak wd. I managed an hour of sleep from 3:30 to 4:30 in which I had a nightmare about drugs. Well guys, I powered through this shit long enough. I caved and took exactly 1 lope pill, 2mgs. I am eagerly awaiting my paltry relief. Hopefully this will push me ""over the hump"" of wd. I find the most comfortable position to be sitting in my folding chair a bit hunched. I'll give an update on how I'm feeling later today. Hopefully I don't junk out and take 10 lope. Really hoping I don't do it. I am sick of prolonged misery. See u guys later!",1511699514.0

I won't get into semantics because it's not important.  All you need to know is that I'm in the USA and I'm bordering Canada. 

So I pick up a couple bundles from this new plug I met (off CL of all places).  It was my second or third time copping and his stuff was pretty decent. Anyway, I pull over in an inconspicuous parking lot and do the deed... you all know how that goes. So after a few wax baggies are empty, and I'm feeling much happier, I light up a cig and I plug my home address into the GPS. At this point I'm downtown, and I live a few miles away in the burbs.  

I start driving and come across a rotary with many exits all close together.  I take the one I thought was correct, and my gps thought I took the correct one as well, so I continued on this road for around half a mile.  Then my heart drops as I see signs for the US border coming up.  I pull over at the duty free store before the checkpoints and ask the lady if there is anywhere to turn around without crossing the border.  She tells me I may be able to just swing the car around and hop on the freeway which is tantalizingly close to me.  I put my bundles in what I considered a good hiding spot and turn the car around.

I make it as far as the very entrance to the highway when I see not one, but three border patrol SUVs whip out behind me and pull me over. There are also agents running out of the checkpoint flagging me down. Immediately they tell me to turn the car off and get out. 

""What the hell do you think you're doing?!""
""Sir, I took a wrong turn and was just trying to get back to where I was coming from.""
""Well you went too far.""
""I'm just trying to get back to x, I'm not trying to cross the border.""
""Where were you coming from? Why were you there? What were you really doing? You're acting nervous. Come with me""

At this point the reality of the situation is staring to sink in, and as I'm being searched head to toe I realize my vehicle is getting the same treatment. So basically I tried to keep my cool and answer courtesly, but these guys and gals have a whole nother sense for sniffing out liars and smugglers.

After being searched and basically interrogated for around ten more minutes they told me to have a seat in this locked glass room.  As I sat there there I thought about how I was going to be spending the next decade or so in federal prison. I nearly came to terms with it then and there, because I figured I had no hope of getting away.  After all, these people are professionals at searching cars for illicit drugs.

Well another 20 minutes pass and the officer at the counter calls my name.  Time to face the music. 

""So we found out of state plates behind your back seat. Care to explain?""
""I just moved here from Boston and MA didn't want the plates back""
""Oh I see. Well here are your keys, you're all set.""

Oh my fucking God you guys, the elation I felt when I finally got back in my car and the nice border patrol lady pointed me in the correct direction to the highway back to safety... It was pure fucking bliss. Better than the two bags I did right before this incident occurred.

I got out of there fast and had to pull over once I got off the highway just to collect my nerves and go over what the fuck just happened to me. I was singing. I was laughing, hell I probably even cried.  I definitely went into my safe spot and did a few more bags to celebrate (and to ensure they didn't just confiscate them). Everything was there and I got away Scott free. This type of thing happens once in a lifetime so now I make DAMN sure I'm not on a one-way road to a vehicle narcotics search.

This story is 100% true and I count my blessings every day since this has happened.

I would like some recommendations for shows that are good to watch even if some sections/scenes are missed.

Another type of show would be one where scenes aren't dependent on eachother so much, like COPS, skit shows, etc.

I don’t like taking subs, and I don’t want to be physically dependent on them. I mean the reason I’m retiring off opiates is so I’m not dependent on anything 

I’ve greatly lowered my dose to the point of doing only up to 8mg of hydromorphpne each day for the past couple of days. Before that my normal dose was a minimal of around 24mg or hydromorphone and 60mg or oxycodone  

Yesterday I did around 12mg over 24hour block, with the last dose being exactly 24houra ago and only doing 8mg max the previous 72hours. 

I know for a fact the WD won’t be as bad as normal. But was wondering a couple things 

I will be fine doing subs 24hours last if I slept for the past 8hours of that 24? 
I won’t go into PWDs ? Since I lowered my dosage so low 

Since I tapered off of my normal DOC and dose, doing subs for a week max def is  more then enough? 
Specially if I tapped off the subs within that week ?

7fl6dg,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7fl6dg/suboxone_facts/,42,https://redd.it/7fl6dg,klove99,Suboxone Facts,"I'm posting this as it comes up a half dozen times every single day and I'm tired of typing up the same thing. So here's some facts about suboxone:

**1. Bioavailability** *ORAL (sublingual, aka ""dissolve under the tongue"") IS ONLY 30% BA*. That means when you are taking it under your tongue, you are ONLY getting 30% (or about 1/3) of the advertised dose. If you take 8mg by mouth, you are getting 2.4mg in your system. Sniffing is 50% BA. IV is 100%.

**2. The half-life** of suboxone is 36 hours. This means if you have 4mg active in your system right now, tomorrow the same time you will have 2/3 that, or 2.66667 (2 and 2/3). If you take the same amount every day, the dose active within your system is growing. Keep this in mind, you should every couple of days halve your dose to prevent getting to insane amounts it will be hard to ever get off. Here is a calculator you can use to know how much is in your system FROM A SINGLE DOSE. Remember to take into account BA: http://www.drugsdb.com/resources/drug-half-life-calculator/ It's more complicated to calculate multiple days of usage, you can do it one-offs like this:

.

**Math: How much is in my system after X time taking Y amount every day at same time**

.

If you dose every day same time (or if you dose twice a day, you can ""average it out"" to a single dose for less-complicated maths):

Take the amount you took day 1 and multiply it by the BA percentage (so for oral 8mg, this would be 8 * .3 = 2.66667) Let's call this A. Let's call B the amount calculated from the last day.

.

For day 1:



B = A * .6666667 + A

.

For the next day:

.

B(new) = B(previous) * .666667 + A

.

And repeat for each day. For an example of 4 days at 8mg oral,
 
.

A = 2.666667 ( this is 8 * .3 )

.

B(day 2) = 2.666667( pre-dose amount remaining)  * .6666667 + 2.666667

.

B(day2) = 4.44445 mg in your system after you dose on day 2.

.

B(day 3) = B(day2) * .666667 + A

B(day 3) = 4.44445 * .666667 + 2.666667

B(day 3) = 5.6296mg in your system after you dose.

.

B(day 4) = B(day 3) * .666667 + A

B(day 4) = 5.6296 * .666667 + 2.666667

B(day 4) = 6.41976

.

Make sense?

.

**Math: How long do I have to stop taking suboxone to get down to X amount left in my system?**

.


Then, to figure out ""how many days until I get it down to X level"", just repeat the equation without adding A, i.e. multiple the total by .6666667 for each day until you get below the number you are trying to reach.

So to see where we would be if we stopped taking after day 4 in the above example,

.

B(day 5) = B(day 4) * .666667

B(day 5) = 6.41976 * .666667

B(day 5) = 4.27984 mg at the time you would usually dose left in your system

.

B(day 6) = B(day 5) * .666667

B(day 6) = 4.27984 * .666667

B(day 6) = 2.85322mg left in your system on the usual dose time after  2 days of not dosing after 4 days of dosing 8mg orally.

.

**3. Receptors / Blocking Effects**: Here is a chart that shows how much saturation your receptors have (basically, at any point in time, this % of receptors are being blocked by suboxone) http://www.helpmegetoffdrugs.net/_images/receptor.png . 

Please remember that just because 50% is blocked does NOT mean ""do twice as much"" 


**4. What is ""precipitated withdrawal""** - That is when you force the drugs that are getting you high off the receptors because bupe is stronger than your DOC. This is true for everything except folks doing pure fentanyl or several fent analogs, as those are stronger than bupe and the situation gets more complicated here. I won't focus on that. See next number

**5. Inducing** - You should induce on subs SLOWLY. Take 1mg orally every half hour until you've built up a couple mg (don't try to do more than a few mg in a day, you'll regret it later). If you start to feel sick, hold off a couple hours for you to come down more. THere is a lot of science behind the slow induction, and you can even take a mg or 2 orally as you finish off the last of your bag in order to have an ""easier"" come-down.

.

**6. Naloxone** - 

**NOTE: There has been much contention in this section. This section is written with the assumption that you are coming from an agonist (such as heroin, morphine, or orxy), and NOT that you're already stabilized on bupe/subs. If you are already stabilized, then of course PWD doesn't even apply to you period.** 


""Suboxone"" contains generally 1/4 the amount of naloxone as bupe. So 8mg bupe / 2mg naloxone. It's put there to be a deterrent against anything but oral. Doing oral, you'll barely get any naloxone; not an appreciable amount. Sniffing you'll get slightly more than oral, enough to make a difference, but not a big amount stil. IVing you will get the full dose of naloxone. Why is this important? Naloxone will throw you into precipitated withdrawal with a vengance. If you plan on doing means other than oral, you will need to wait even longer than you would oral because the naloxone will throw you into precipitated withdrawal harder than the suboxone would. If you plan to IV, it is best to induce oral slowly on day 1, maybe into day 2 (of abstaining from other opiates) before starting to IV, in order to prevent the worst sickness of your life (precipitated withdrawal)

I think this covers it mostly. Maybe we can clean this up and get it stickied or side-barred or something, maybe I can just link folks here when they ask. Please voice your questions you'd like to get answered if I forgot to include anything here, thanks.

I always thought that if I put some clean time together, life would return to normal and everything would be alright. That day never came, apparently, if you suffer from trauma, even if it is seemingly benign, it will keep you coming back until you end up in prison or dead. 
Luckily for me, I just ended up in rehab. I was skeptical at first because I had done this song and dance once before, to no avail and I didn't feel that I was any more ready to quit this time than the last, although the circumstances I regularly found myself entrenched in, screamed otherwise. 
So I embraced those thirty days in a private residential treatment facility, nestled in the beautiful mountains of western Canada and accepted that this was the end. I dealt with the major skeleton I had been harboring in my closet and continued to learn coping strategies for the outside world. 
Aside from the 50lbs. I put on there, I now smile frequently, my skin is clear, but most of all, I am at peace with sobriety and myself. I no longer have to participate in that daily rat race to stay well. I sleep like never before and the change is apparent to everyone that has been around to witness it.

I never really post, even though I've been a long time lurker of a lot of subreddits, especially opiates. Something really fucked up happened to me and it has a lot to do with me being on heroin, so I can't talk to many people that I personally know would understand me. I feel like you all would. 

A fee weeks ago, I was hanging out in my staircase with this guy I've known for a few years. Initially, I didn't like him but we have a lot of mutual friends and he lives in my neighborhood so we got to know each other and developed something like a friendship. Anyways, we were in my staircase at around 2am, he was smoking s blunt and I was railing lines of some China white. (He was one of the few people that know I used.) 
To make a long story shorter,  about a bundle in I ended up nodded out, and when I came to he was violating me. He had his dick out and he was rubbing it in my body I had no idea what the fuck to do. I got up and he kept following me and wouldn't stop  touching me until I finally decided to just leave into my apartment.

 I only told two of my close friends about this, because I was not only humiliated this ever happened I felt I would be blamed because I wasn't more vocal with my displeasure and because I was on dope. We all know the stigma that comes with this drug. 

One of the friends I trusted ended up having a big ass mouth and now everyone I know, knows what happened. The man made a post on facebook admitting it all, but he also added all of the details I did not want to get out. People are still taking his side and defending him. Whenever my friend tries to stick up for me, people say ""you should be more worried about her addiction. Not this."" ""Why is no one speaking about the fact that she was on heroin tho?"" ""Why didn't she just go to court?"" ""No one would believe a junkie anyways."" These are people's literal replies. I'm not one to care about strangers opinions but I still feel fucking sick. He admitted to violating me and still no one gives a shit, or they're actually mad at me and want to fight me and the friend that's sticking up for me. And all of this was spread around because someone else couldn't keep their mouth shut. 

This is the exact reason I didn't tell anyone. I don't know what to do or how to feel.  I'm sorry this is my first post here but I needed it off my chest and I know this community wouldn't judge me.",1511667278.0

The good news is that there is an over the counter medication that protects your liver from the damaging effects of acetaminophen. Acetaminophen depletes your livers glutathione, and when it runs out the liver starts to decay. There is a medication called NAC or N-Acetyl-Cysteine that replenishes your livers glutathione reserves. This also helps avoid hang overs. The stuff has a lot of other benefits, it has been shown to be beneficial to people suffering from obstructive lung diseases as well, and there doesn’t seem to be an upper limit to the amount you can take. I wouldn’t take the whole bottle, but you can take many with no problem. 

Do not take NAC and then think you’re immune to acetaminophen. But if you’re doing it anyways you might as well be as safe as possible. I have personally taken it and taken a huge amount of acetaminophen and I used to be a bad alcoholic. When I had my liver checked for a drug study I was told that my liver function was perfect. 

It only has a 10% oral BA so take at least 2000 mg or so. Anyways, this is the same stuff they will give you if you go the hospital for acetaminophen overdose IV. ",1511661946.0

I had been doing sex work for awhile as well, and was making bank. Sucked a lot of cock, did a lot of fetish shit, had a lot of fun. I had showed up to Thanksgiving at my parents' house, looking like I did. And it was not a pretty sight. Nasty arms, was down to 120lbs (5'11"" and looked like a total disgusting mess, not model thin like I thought I was). I do not remember being there. I def was not showing up to my parents' house sober, so that would explain my blackout state. I heard stories how I told everyone I was seeing the ghost of my dead best friend everywhere- which was true.

So I bounced out of Thanksgiving pretty quick and went back to where I was staying. I had a mattress on the floor, but that was all there was. It was this dark little place filled with disgusting energy of shit and dope and horrible thoughts where I would imagine taking a nice big rig and slicing myself up and down my arms and waiting until I felt cold.

I hadn't been high in weeks. I was basically just chasing back being sick every day. I would wake up and have a shot laid out next to me for when I would inevitably wake up sick. 

Psychosis was coming and going regularly, I was getting texts and calls on my phone telling me there were people outside, told me I was plague riddled, spreading HIV and Hep C everywhere and someone had found out about it and sent men to kill me in order to cleanse humanity, ect. 

That was how I felt. Like a shit stain on humanity. Every time I would cop I would tell myself I would rather just be sick for a few days than do this shit again and I didn't.

So 5 years ago it was just me sitting in my shitty little place on my soiled ass mattress smoking cigarettes, shooting dope and smoking meth or crack, updating backpage ad and waiting for calls.

I have 5 years clean in a few days. I dunno if I want to tell that story here or not. I am just watching another junkie do his first detox as I am typing this right now. Plenty of valium for this dude right now. So he is sleeping and I am bored so hit me up.",1511659375.0

I tend to binge for a week or so and then quit for a few months. Ive always abused drugs in general though whether smoking weed or my long term benzo habit ive just tapered. Im mostly clean since tapering the benzos and not even smoking pot for the first time in 15 years. Opiates ive fucked about with but i knew that i was too susceptible to addiction(had a nasty k habit for a few years) to do with any frequency but opium, snorted h and even the subs i used for a quick taper(and the one left over i used for a buzz when bored) after a binge just work too well. Exactly as that video on how does h feel like, everything feels fine. This is an issue iv been struggling with for 10 years but since i quit benzos opis have been on my mind since im a downer type of guy.

Maybe its paws from years of benzo use, maybe years of poly drug abuse but im pretty sure my dopamine system is fucked. Even speed paste, which im not really a fan of, picks me up enough to get things done. Ive tried ssris and therapy which never really helped, pot is kind of hit and miss since im in the uk and not legal so the right strain isnt always easy to come by.

One of my friends relatives was prescribed 5x oxy 30s per day, 3x 10mg hydros, and a few other pain meds to be able to cope with his debilitating foot pain (basically part of his foot is rotting off) and the doctor recently cut him off all of his medications cold turkey. Now he's in severe pain, barely able to function, and extremely sick. Just because of this ""epidemic.""

I feel like this is hurting the people who need the meds more than those who abuse it.
In my eyes, all this is going to cause is a decrease in prescription medication abuse, but an increase in heroin/street drug abuse.
I already know 3 people who made the switch to heroin because they got cut off of their prescription medications. I think this is a horrible sign and a horrible solution to a non-existent problem.

We've had people who abuse opioids for a long time, and cutting people off their meds isn't gonna change that.

(rant),"Now... just a pre warning that im typing this on my phone just after thunder fucking scared the shit out of me. Fuck you melbourne... first you have a hot as fuck week and now its waking me up from a well needed sleep.

Okay so... ive been using opiates for 3 to 4 years now... mind you that i cannot tolerate more then 150mg of codeine before feeling sick... which is why i probably havent moved onto harder stuff... despite the fact that my sciatica aint getting better magically.

I hate it when people say stuff like ""opiates are a danger to everyone. Youre an abuser that only likes getting high"" etc... and i mean... yeah i hate taking opiates.. im sure deep down we all sort of do. Which is why im lucky that im not eating the heavy stuff. 

But this opioid crisis thats happenining basically everywhere.. i hate it. I sometimes wish it didnt exist because thanks to opioids ive lost 4 friends who were so close to me just because they thought they were functional users... they honestly werent since thwy didnt have a job and all they did all day was get high. Sleep. Get high again. Sleep. Sell their possessions to get high again. Sleep.... i didnt notice this until this year how bad they were... they were broke as shit and i offered them help. But then they turned on me and said ""youre just like us""...

Now... i dont know about anyone else but this hurt so much. This hurt more then any pain ive had in my short life (im not dead but i am only 23)

It took me 2 days of convincing to go to this sub... to understand what everyone goes through... and it hurts to come here sometimes because of the culture... people are looking forward to getting high... to play with death... 

I love this sub... not because i enjoy being here. But because it shows both sides of a long battle... youre all like a little family... but sometimes the images are too much and its heavy to see.

I hate opiates but its the only thing i can take for my back pain... i hate when people mention weed... because the last thing i need is to get hooked on another drug

And please dont tell me that weed isnt addictive because it is... it may not be as addictive as opiates but its still a habit forming thing and thats the last thing i need.

Please... i plead with all of you who are deep in this game... stay safe. I cant tell you to quit (and i know its hard to quit since meds like suboxone are expensive or something) and... well yeah just stay safe. I dont consider many of you my friend but were all family here. We dont want to lose anyone else. 

My friends that died due to opiates had a bright future. One was 2 weeks away from seeing his grandmother who was dying from cancer... now his grandmother has to... well... pass away without seeing her grand son.

Please... stay safe.

I beat myself up over this, I was so emotionally unstable it was scary. I kept thinking that if I'd been around him he'd be here still because I assumed it was an overdose like everyone else. Well, I recently was informed that he actually died from tumors and heart issues that he would have certainly never treated had he known. So, now that has been a huge weight off my shoulders that has allowed me to move on from beating myself up and wishing I could end it all as well. I'm aware he is in a better place so I'm content enough. I still miss him like crazy but that will never change. 

September 11th, my birthday my ever so loving mother attempted suicide. She has actually seen the steps I've been taking to get back on track and she has been trying as well. I think it finally hit her that she could genuinely lose her family if an overdose didn't take her so she finally found a reason to live. Which I am actually happy for her. She isn't clean by any means, and I've accepted she never will be due to chronic pain however she is trying and not the same person she was just mere months ago. 

I have finally stopped being ashamed and hiding from friends and family after my very public overdose and have started moving on. My brother that I actually like, not the one who robbed me while I laid there dying that night has started talking to me again and accepting me. Which alone makes getting up everyday easier. I start a new job next month, which is an extremely notoriously hard job to get in my city which I'm beyond excited for. So, I can finally start my new chapter in life. 

But the best part? I have money in my pocket and can keep money in my pocket. 

I'm planning on buying another house in the near future as well. So, goals goals goals. And maybe a pair of Yeezy's if everything goes well lol.

I'm on subs now and actually feel pretty positive how things are coming along. I haven't had any cravings. I go to AA almost every day for my alcoholism problem which helps curb all my addictions (I also quit benzos with the alcohol last year after I was taking 10 pills a day and mixing with vodka before bed). But things seem good. I'm starting to make decent money again, and it going into a saving account instead of right up my nose. I'm not scared about this upcoming year. I got this.

The day after I quit this time, my mother came into my room while I was sweating and sick on the bed. She told me I should 'write down what they should do just in case'. I asked what she meant. She meant I need to write my will, because she's not sure I'm going to outlive her.

I've managed to don't take opiates during an entire week and then   i took again my morphine codeine and promethazine combo and i was so surprised when it kicked it, i felt again that warm and relaxing feeling in my entire body, a slight euphoria, and i was nodding so bad too, it took me like 20 minutes to write on my keyboard a 10 words sentence, i think i also that i fell asleep in front of the computer during an entire hour, i don't remember much

I thought that in order to get my tolerance back to normal and have great effects again i would have to stop opiates during like 3 or 4 weeks, why only a one week break  helped so much ? is it because i was only taking tramadol and it's a very weak opiate ? Or is it maybe because i only took  everyday tramadol only  during 2 or 3 months max before i decided to stop ? ",1511630124.0

I get a drug test once a week at my iop and that might be tonight if not it'll be then be tomorrow or Thursday. So like 3 weeks ago when I just had the sub in my system I froze a bottle of piss in a water bottle then put it in a dark plastic bag inside another plastic ziplock. I read online you could store urine for drug tests like this for a couple months and it would still be good. Anyways I went to take it out of the freezer just now and put it in the fridge to start thawing. Well when I did I smelled the urine and it smelled pretty stale that real strong pungent smell of old piss. Would this still be useable for my drug test or has it gone bad to the point where they will be able to tell besides the smell? I know the smell is a concern as well but thinking I might be able to pull that off but just wanted to see what your thoughts were on if they'll be able to tell with the test. Like the nurse will probably smell that it's stale as fuck but I'm hoping if I can somehow get past that part it'll at least pass there tests. I'm almost positive they use like a 7 or 10 panel and then only send to lab if it's positive for something. Any help is appreciated especially if you have experience with what I'm describing.

Yes, I know it's late so I'm expecting little if any response, and let's just blame drugs and a great memory for anything that is of no immediate or future use or relevance to my life for the title of the post but the sentiment changeth not. Besides, with whom shall I share the penultimate quicksphere of this night? 


**Tinychat can be VERY shitty about the mobile app so if you can connect with a computer, that is the best option.**  
firstly, this chat is not affiliated with this subreddit or its moderators, and has its own moderators, rules, and etiquette. if you feel someone there has slighted you take it up with the moderators of tinychat, as it is completely unaffiliated with and not endorsed by this or any other subreddit.  
just a reminder and an announcement that a bunch of your fellow degenerate junkies, chippers, and tourists hang out in [our very own tinychat room](http://tinychat.com/ropiatesubchat) which has been an ongoing tradition for something like four years now. the location, for those who can't do links for whatever reason, is http://tinychat.com/ropiatesubchat.  

tinychat is an extremely buggy videochat client, but also the only one that fills its particular niche---that being, anyone who knows the room name may enter, and it has a youtube player. any technical difficulties may be addressed by the moderator, namely me. we like to hang out, listen to music, talk about random shit, and lately have even had our own resident sketch artist who draws random crap upon request. the primary purposes for the room's existence are companionship and harm reduction---it's nice to be able to shoot up with others around, even if you are technically alone in the non-digital sense, and have people keeping an eye on you. we're also glad to help with any problems you might be having, or questions you might need answered. we aim to be a welcoming, friendly space for the members of this subreddit to do what we do in good company without judgement. so stop by if you are bored, or just need to talk.  

if it appears like there is a moderator in the room but who is not speaking, just type a few sentences to summon them back. if you are on mobile it is not immediately apparent that there is anyone in the room. either click the button shaped like an outline of a person (i think) to see the list, or say hello to see if anyone responds.  


rules:  

1. pick a unique username. this is to protect other users so we know who is who, given the nature of the sort of activities we enjoy. 

2. no lurking. again, to protect the other users. if you come in the room be prepared to introduce yourself and participate for at least a few minutes so we know you're not up to any shenanigans. if you are lurking you will be warned and then given a generous ten minutes to announce yourself. if the time runs out, you will be kicked (not banned) until you are ready to come in and actually participate. if you are a known member whose identity can be confirmed, this rule is not applicable.  

3. no -isms or hate speech, even accidental. one warning will be issued, any continued insistence on such behavior will result in a ban. bans can be contested by pm'ing a moderator (me). this includes but is not limited to racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia. for example, if you are not black, use of the n-word, even with the -a ending, will not be tolerated. i don't care if your friend down the block lets you say it, it's not your lane. 

4. no auditory fuckery. due to peculiarities of the transmission of sound over a chat, certain echos and effects can be amplified to the point of being severely distressing. if it is determined that your end is causing an echo you will be asked to use headphones, or to mute your microphone when not speaking. deliberately making strange or unpleasant noises to annoy other chatters will not be tolerated, and your broadcast will be closed. (this only means that your video/audio feed will be terminated--you will still be allowed to type.)  

i know the rules seem like a lot but there's really only four of them, and only two that pertain to just behaving in a manner that isn't dickish.

I don't feel any or very minor pain anymore (I used to be able to feel pain as the shot moved up the arm, for a couple inches until it became mixed with enough blood to not be noticable), the wounds seem to be a lot less and heal a lot better, I notice I don't get the ""taste"" anymore of dope when I shoot like I used to, and overall I just feel better. It also makes sense as your blood naturally contains electrolytes that you should mix in solution which also contains such, I had just never thought it important enough before to warrant actually doing.

So what do you guys think? Anyone else salting the water before shooting? Think you should give it a shot? Share your thoughts.",1511756163.0

If I stretch it, I can usually make it last about 9 days. Tried to chip a few times with very little success. Unfortunately I had a pretty big heroin habit in the past, so within about 2-3 days my tolerance goes through the roof. The last half of the 10 days are pretty much dissapointingly trying to chase the initial high. After the 10 days of bliss I am jolted into withdrawals that seem to be just as bad as heroin (probably mostly mental, but major or minor withdrawls fucking suckl). 

My question is how to get the most bang for the buck. What's the best way to enhance the high?

Also have Xanax and gabapentin. Sometimes I'll add in a little xan to the mix, but that usually results in passing out and not enjoying the high as much.

I went up to 3.5mg again had intense feelings of euphoria but much like the last times ive went up or down these euphoric feeling only lasts for a few days than poops out. its not even a great euphoria its better to describe it as a great anti anxiety/mood enhanced feeling. I am by no means trying to stay on the drug....just trying to get the most out of it before i go into detox. Should i lower my dose tomorrow when i see the doctor? Should i switch to Subutex, would that help create more euphoria?

7frfsc,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7frfsc/looking_back_pt_2/,13,https://redd.it/7frfsc,MaybeIFuckedUpThrway,Looking back pt 2,"So I posted this last night while bored, felt like posting again as I am bored (https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7fjkph/looking_back).

So that was that. 5 years ago today I was stuck in a hole. Stuck so deep in a hole lacking any conversation where I was not being accused, bellittled, blamed, or conducting business for buying drugs or selling myself. Romanticizing killing myself nightly as a wonderful ascension away from all the zombies and insufferable reproducing masses of people desperately trying to make it seem as if any iota of what they did actually mattered on the grand scheme of things.

I had felt death many times before, felt this wonderful healing, terrifying place where I simply faded into the background. This beautiful form and void where nothing mattered and everything was entirely happy and inconsequential. 

So this is where things get odd and I start questioning the nature of my reality and still question it to this day, whether this was an incredibly vivid manifestation of my psychosis or whether I am now dead somewhere and this reality I am in now is far different from the one I originally was in. 

I had stolen a car and was staying in a motel quite literally called State Line motel, which was so shitty my door was not properly locked, so I decided while shooting dope I would prop my feel up against the door. 

So, of course, shooting dope, I have the needle in my arm and am juuuust pulling the plunger up to make sure I have a nice juicy vein. And then I hear banging on my door. 

""""Sherrif's department, open up!""

Unfortunately the banging on the door causes my unbraced legs to slip and fuck up my grip on the rig, and I see my skin tear open as the door is forced open by the officer. 

I don't really see anything much at this point. I remember a panic, I remember seeing blood pouring out of arm, and that it had this nice and warm sensation as covered my body. I tried to get the strength to cover up the wound and put pressure on it. I just felt warmth of my blood enveloping me as I slipped into this sunken place where moving became laborous, my eyes closed, and the last thing I remember is a cold settling into my body as a tiny ounce of my being tried to will me up and fight while my chest and head felt as if they were weighted with bricks. 

And then I woke up. 

I woke up in a place where I did not recognize, I was in bed, I was screaming at the top of my lungs. A person rushed at me with a flashlightas I grabbed for my arm, gripping it tightly and jumped up, only to fall on my side and smack my head into a nightstand. 

The person with the flashlight calmed me down and asked what had happened. I told her I must have had a nightmare, and not knowing where I was did not help much so I kept a lot to myself. 

I later find out I was in rehab. I do not remember how I got there. The story I was told was my brother had found me in the same motel I remember being in, I agreed to go to the hospital with him, screamed at the ER staff, was placed on a 72 hour hold, and then shanghaied away to rehab once my parents learned of my predicament. I had been there only one night. 

We were not allowed to use phones while detoxing (5 days), and everyone around me was a stranger so I kept to myself. I was convinced I had died and was in some sort of fucked up purgatory while Psychiatrists and docs put me on a regimen of lithium and asked me questions about my use and history.

I was having some pretty serious psychosis and demanded to the clinical director every five minutes that the cameras outside my window and in my bathroom be removed. I would constantly receive the same sorts of texts on my phone about people coming to kill me and all that- except I did not have a phone to receive texts on so that was another hallucination altogether. 

I was screaming about helicopters and Spec Ops teams trying to get in to the rehab in group, all while never hearing from anyone I had ever met before and being convinced I was dead. 

So we went to our first meeting. I hallucinated furry little creatures crawling up my legs and freaked out in the meeting and ran out to smoke and chill the fuck out. It was at this meeting where I first stood up and said I was an addict.

My pukey nasty greasy cold sweaty self twitching and shouting in a meeting stood up in front of a 150 ppl and said I was an addict. I don't know why the fuck I did it I just did. 

I swear to God every one of those people got up and hugged me. 

I used to sing to my tricks after we got done fucking. I would spoon them and humm gently in their ears, stroking their hair. They would almost always bawl their fucking eyes out. It kindof got me off. So as I stood there in my shitty self, getting hugged by 150 strangers, I started crying. 

I just wanted something. Anything. I had given up on the hope of connection with anyone after so long just me and dope that this disgusting outpouring of love and heart, it broke me. I just sat there in my chair shaking and crying and not knowing what the fuck that was.",1511745495.0

So I don't know if getting ripped off is par the course or if I just make people want to fuck me over. I've been using for ~5 years and when I was using pills I had no problems what so ever. I'd even get them in the original rx bottle usually. I eventually switch to H a year ago cause I ended up getting hooked (shocker) and it seemed a lot cheaper. I never bought more than a half gram and I thought I knew what a point looked like, so I assumed I was getting what I was paying for. I had several dealers too so it's not even like it was one person. Anyway, I bought a scale on someone's recommendation and have been weighing everything I've bought and without fail every half gram is .35-.45, usually on the lower end of the scale regardless of dealer. Like what the fuck? Is this just how it is? Why would every single fucking dealer consistently be short. Getting single points its only ever 80 mg or something. Yesterday I even tried cold copping at a known spot, got a point and scaled it... fucking .7... and the people going there are definitely seasoned junkies. I'm guessing they assume people aren't scaling up what they buy or maybe that's just how it is and everyone accepts it but goddamn does it suck. Maybe I just give off the impression I'm dumb and I won't ever notice, who knows. In either case, I don't know how to approach this. My town is definitely a sellers market and I'm sure if I called someone out on it, they'd just ignore me and carry on business as usual. I'm thinking I'm either going to go back to pills and just taper down until I can chip again or just use other avenues from here on out cause this is fucked. /rant",1511743719.0

1. Will my Oxy tolerance transition over to H?
2. How much would get me “good”?
(My Dboy says it comes in caps, and it’s powder inside and it’s a tan color, he said one cap should have me good for the first time)
3. What exactly should I expect if I choose to do this?

4. Since I said I’m getting it in a cap and it’s tan powder inside, I want to sniff or smoke it, is it possible to smoke the powder? I like smoking oxy so I feel like this is what I want to do if I can, if not I’ll just sniff it.

So my main ended up in the hostpital about 4 days ago for unrelated-to-drugs health issues (he doesn't use). He's in his 50s.

He lives with a 40-something crackhead (occasional user). When she's not cracked out, she takes care of the house, cleans, makes sure everyone is fed....basically does mom stuff and everyone generally tolerates her because of this.

When he goes into the hospital,  shes tasked with selling his pills, mainly opana. Well, she isn't right mentally at all. super nervous, can't handle stress, etc. My issue is that she literally has to do nothing but sit there and hand them out. There are only 3 of us that buy anyway.

Well, she got *so* fucking irritated that she took all the pills to her friends and locked them up so that if anyone needs something, she has to go to his house, get the pills (just the number needed and no more!) and then come home and sell them,. effectively making it harder on herself and everyone else in the process.

Today, she blatantly rubbed the fact that we were hurting and that she was going to take her time getting the pills, in our faces. It was 4pm when she finally graced us with her presence, all the while getting texts from her laughing at me for needing something she had so badly.

So she said she had 7 opanas left and the only people, as I Said, that buy them are 3 of us and I know them all.

When she came back around 4,  she also said that there weren't any more left, that she sold 5 to these people that don't even do them.

She's completely lying. Shes been threatening to just stop selling to us altogether and pretending to be ""out""...a joke that wasn't received well. When she showed up at 4, she was tweaking out, jerky motions, sniffing, rubbing her nose, the works. So either she sold them for crack or shes full of shit.

**I start a fucking JOB tomorrow!!** I was counting on those fucking things.

So i got this crackhead that won't sell me the drugs she's been tasked with selling, probably because she sold them for crack, or because she just wants to be a cunt.

I've fucking so goddamn pissed off right now. I haven't been this furious in a long time. I think it's because she's such a little piece of crap that doesn't give two fucks about anyone else. 

One time, she made off with his last 3 opanas and went on a crack binge - came back swearing she didn't take them, and he **let** her come back to live!

I remembered reading about people extracting the resin from their tooters. I had never done it and I had put several ounces through a single Tooter, so I'm out of tar and finally scraped it. I've removed 0.3g so far. I tried smoking a little and it is really harsh but trails really well and seems more potent as I would expect. So I can smoke the .3 and just be well or I can IV .3 and get a great nod. So I'm wondering has anyone IVd the resin from a Tooter? I've only seen posts with speculation saying that since it was burned it probably has a bunch carcinogenic toxins in it. To me that seems true but I'd expect it to have less residual parts like the crap left on the foil. Plus the cotton could filter out some of the soot or charred parts.

Last night I was at work driving the company car and I hit a deer. No big deal, I’m not responsible, no injuries so I thought I’d just take the night off and start again. My boss gets to the accident and sees that the airbag deployed and says “looks like you’re taking a trip to the hospital”.

I immediately started to panic, the accident wasn’t caused by me using opiates, but if they’re in my system I lose my job. I immediately start doing some googling while we wait for the tow and see mixed answers on whether or not I’ll be tested in the hospital. While I’m looking my phone dies so I only see a few websites before I have to go to the hospital. My wrist and shin started to REALLY hurt by the time I get to the Dr but I don’t say a word because I know if I have an injury I’ll definitely get a drug test.

They overheard me telling my GF my wrist hurt from where the airbag deployed and start asking questions:

“From 1-10 how bad does it hurt”

Answer: 3. Reality: 6

“Can you move it?”

Yes

“Does it hurt to move it?”

Answer: No. Reality: Fuck yes. 

The nurse tells me they still want to do an X-ray and because my boss is there I can’t just say no. The receptionist comes in for all the paperwork and she’s saying a bunch of shit I’m not really paying attention to and I hear “I called and you don’t need a drug test”. Thank fuck.

They informed me that my training class will begin on December 4th but they asked me to come in tomorrow (Monday the 27th) for the paperwork portion of starting a new job. They also informed me that at some point I will need to pass a drug screen.

However, I do not know if that will be given to me tomorrow with a 24 hour time period to get it completed or if they will wait until the later in the week or even when the training class starts. My guess would be tomorrow they will give me a form that will require me to complete the drug screen within 24 hours. I have already informed the recruiter that I have another job that I have given notice for and will be leaving before the training class begins so if worse comes to worst I can try putting it off by saying I am too busy with work and need a couple extra days to clear it out of my system.

Now, my question is, if the drug screen is just a 5-panel test, will oxymorphone and xanax show up as positive on test. I'm fairly sure xanax won't even show up on 10-panel, but I could be wrong about that, but lucky for me that's not what I'm dealing with right now. I snorted oxymorphone and took xanax orally this morning (Saturday the 26th), so if I was to test tomorow or Tuesday I'd most likely fail. But I've heard from a few different sources that neither of those substances will show up on a 5-panel, but what has me worried is that oxymorphone has small amounts of morphine and if I happen to test positive for morphine I will fail the test and lose the job before I even begin.

Any answers and advice would be greatly appreciated! That is, unless it is just someone saying my best option would be to quit altogether. Obviously that's the best course of action and I wouldn't be here if it was that easy. 

Also, as an aside, if I was to start taking suboxone today and over the course of the next few days, how would that affect a 5-panel (or 10-panel test) test for that matter?

Edit: What the fuck is up with this sub? I just wanted to post and get a better idea about what to expect with my upcoming drug screen and right away had ppl calling me dumbass and telling me to shut the fuck up.

Oh, and I forgot to mention my dad is dying of stage 4 lung cancer and doesn't want anything to do with me because of my drug use. And the rest of my family hates  me because of my addiction as well. I wasn't even invited to Thanksgiving this year. Fuck em I guess. This all happened about 2 and a half weeks ago, I just now am feeling better having detoxed off a gram of fire ecp (most likely fentanyl) and feel up to posting about it. 

  .            .So it all started about 2 and a half weeks ago when I was driving on the highway, high as the dude from the Red Bull jump, when all of a sudden BAM!!! Fucking slammed into the median and completely totaled the left side of my car. Somehow managed to pull over to the side of the road and called for a tow truck, all the while hoping and praying a cop doesn't show up to see this high as fuck junky sitting on the side of the road. Tow truck comes lickidy split and picks me pathetic ass up. Got seriously lucky I didn't get another DUI so I guess some good came out of this one. 

.          .Fast forward a few days later. My dealer Big Black picks me up from my place to give me a ride to work, and gives me literally the best dope I've ever had in my life on the way over there. I do a shot and am wrecked! I serve tables at a high in restaurant and need to be on my A game when I go in. Well, he pulls over and says, ""nigga you is fucked up. I think you should call off tonight you lookin real bad. You can't even keep your eyes open."" I reluctantly shrug off his suggestion saying I go in looking like this all the time and I'm cool, I can't call off anyway I need dope money son! So, I go in and work my shift thinking I'm cool, nobody knows about my drug use. So after doing a 4th shot in the bathroom stall at work I come out of the bathroom and my manager says he needs to have a word with me. He sits me down and proceeds to tell me he knows something is up.""Dude you come in here one day and your totally fine and then an hour later your running around the restaurant like a crackhead Energizer Bunny. Then an hour later your falling asleep while rolling silverware. What's up man is there something you want to tell me? If you need some time off to come off a medication I understand I'll help you out and grant you some unpaid leave, anything I can do to help?"" I break down crying like a little bitch and tell him I'm all fucked up on drugs (I never specify what I was on) and I need a week off from work to detox. He acts all cool with it and even gives me a bro hug ( you know like the handshake half hug) before he sends me home for the night. 

.          .So I call Big Black to come pick me up and tell him what happened. ""I told you nigga!"" Yea, I know Black, you are always right. Tell him I'm gonna be outta the game for a while and I won't be seeing him for some time. I get ahold of a couple subs and start my detox the next day. A day goes by, cool, I'm getting my life back everything will be ok. Then, a day later my manager calls me. Ooohhhhh shit this isn't going to be good. He tells me I'm too much of a liability to come back to work and they they have to let me go. That two fucked duck looking mother fucker!!! Take your bro hug back you piece of shit!!! So I just lost my job and I'm feeling sick as fuck even with the subs. I'm now broke and jobless with bills piling up.

 .           .I tell my girlfriend I have been using lately and just lost my job because of it. She dumps my ass right on the spot and tells me to get my shit together before i ever contact her again. Great, the love of my life doesn't want to be with a junky and I can't really blame her. We were together for almost 2 years and she has stuck by my side through many relapses but she told me last time if I fuck up again she is flat out done with me. So the love of my life is now gone!!! Im now carless, jobless, broke, and too sick to go out and look for another job. And without a car my options are extremely limited.

.          .My half sister has offered many a times to let me stay with her to help me get clean. I was just never ready to before this all happened. I  made a grand a week at this last job and wasn't ever really willing or wanting to quit using. She lives over an hour a way in bumfuck Egypt where I know I can't get any dope and there aren't any temptations. I guess it's really time  to quit for good. I call her up, tell her what happened, and before I know it shes at my apartment to pick me up to take me back to what is now ""home."" I call my landlord and tell him I lost my car and job and I will have to be moving out seeing how there was no way I could come up with rent money in time let alone keep my gas and electric on. Shit, I didn't even have money for food, fuck me! 

.           .So here I am about 2 weeks after all this has happened. I took Suboxone for a few days and then flushed the rest down the toilet just wanting to be done with all this shit. I took Kratom for a couple days after that and don't even know if it really helped because I still felt awful. I've only taken a little Kratom this past week and I feel fine as of today.

7fopyl,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7fopyl/mkultra_opioid_relation/,9,https://redd.it/7fopyl,neuroloop,MKULTRA: Opioid Relation,"So I have been wondering.. how far did MKULTRA (Mind Control) experiments get with forced morphine addiction? It is well known fact they used heroin addicts specifically to create mind control candidates and experimented with forced morphine addiction. It seems opioid addiction could be perfect for mind control. In fact as we know it as mind control, whether we want it or not.

For those who are not familiar, MKULTRA was a group of experiments done in the mid 1900's by CIA regarding finding a way to create an assassin and gain full control over a person. It also experimented with interrogations and forced morphine addiction to get results.

Even Bostin mobster Whitey Bulger was a victim of this treatment when they told him they were looking for volunteers for a cure to schizophrenia.

As mentioned they used a variety of drugs from barbituates (truth serum) to forced morphine addiction. 

So I ponder the long term implications of opioid addiction and my tin hat comes out.. what if CIA heroin was all an experiment on population control. It is well established during the secret war in Laos that they brought back heroin with dead bodies of GI's. This happened during the time period of MKULTRA and forced opioid addiction.

This article was written on the issue just 2 days ago which is what had me post this: http://www.robertscottbell.com/government/opioids-are-mind-control-drugs-mkultra-is-alive-and-well-by-jon-rappoport/

What do you all think? How far DID THEY GET with the forced morphine addiction studies for controlling people & creating secret assassins? We all know opioid addiction can cause people to do things they don't want to do. React in ways they choose NOT TO ACT. Nothing else known in the world has this capability.

Is the opioid epidemic related to MKULTRA. 

More importantly, is opioid addiction capable of creating a Manchurian candidate? ",1511721131.0

No new revelations here just random observations)"," Does anyone else feel like the first they snorted an opiate or took an opiate in general was the most blissful beautiful feeling in the world. (The dragon blah blah nothing new but I mean in reference to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/7fh3ta/what_it_feels_like_to_do_heroin/ ) I don't agree that it was ""meh"" I had 0 opiate tolerance.

 I snorted a half a roxy (maybe 10 mg) I was outside in the middle of winter surrounded by snow and I couldn't have felt warmer. It was just indescribable. I was also madly in love simultaneously. Talk about nirvana... these days if I take half a blue I'll feel how clogged my nose is and not much more. 

It must be said that the first time I did heroin was not as good as the first time I got high on an opiate. I remember it was just extremely itchy. I scratched my thighs until they bruised. It felt good. I noticed the fact that h was more intense, it felt different not better. So maybe this is what the OP means? Also once I did h I could never go back to oxy because I wouldn't feel it. (Unless it was one of those green oxy 80s but it still felt ruined from the h)

Also wtf is hillbilly heroin I came across this term on some Netflix show. Is that like oxy?

I live in a condo so there are parking spots for everyone so I don’t have my own driveway or anything. I decide to get well in my car before going inside. Start breaking it down to prep and out of no where two plain clothed cops walk right up to my window and knock. Scared the living shit out of me btw. I had probably about .25 or so broke down and soon as I heard the knock on my window I dropped it in the back floorboard of my car as slick as I could. Immediate feeling that he saw what I did. He motioned for me to open the door. So I just rolled down my widow and asked what was the problem. He said someone called about a suspicious person sitting in a car just chilling. I said that I live here and I’m just smoking a cigarette since I don’t smoke inside my home. He then asked for my id and I flexed my rights at that point. Told him I don’t have to give my id if I haven’t broke the law. He of course gets pissed and said for me to sit tight while he runs my plates. He came back and first thing he said was “where are the drugs” I at that point gave off the vibe that I was pissed off for him asking me that since I don’t have any drugs what so ever! (Clearly a lie lol) he said he could smell pot and I told him I’m a medical marijuana card holder and I’m legally aloud to burn trees for medical reasons. He again asked me for my id and I refused. I then asked if I was free to go and he said he wasn’t ready to let me go. So I then asked for his badge number and for him to call his supervisor since I felt like I was being profiled. At that point he said I was free to go and to try not to act suspicious while smoking a cig sitting in my car. I laughed and walked away. Soon as he left I came back out to my car and luckily the dose I was prepping was still sitting on the surface I was breaking it down on and didn’t spill. I’m currently sitting back in my car feeling great 👍 maybe JJ was looking out for me haha,1511717982.0

so after paying attention to the opiate scene i knew i would have a couple of options open to me to try and find a good pill hookup. although i do want to get into dnms im just not ready yet and getting a package right now is my biggest prob. 

after a few misses on cl finally got someone to work with me. sweet. turns out they happen to be very close by which is too ironic for this giant spread out city. i mean we are very close.



so i put in a small order to test out the product and of course the guy is on time to our mellow meet up and come through. has since come through one more time. very very happy with a solid new connect. was stressing that i was going to hit wd before i found a new source but that wasnt the case.


as much as he is a very good source i will continue to develop and nurture our relationship i will also be on the lookout for two to three backup sources. you never ever know when you might need the backup so its always good to have.

It feels good to be back here because I love this sub, it’s a little bittersweet because coming back here means that I relapsed after a year of clean time. I went to rehab and followed it up with 3 months of outpatient. I was doing great in sobriety, got a girlfriend that I really like and my job is going really well. I got jumped by 2 guys when I was drunk about a month ago (when I say sober I mean from opiates) and had to be rushed to the ER with brain bleeding, had to get stitches in my lip, and the inside of my ear was fractured. I was blind sided by the way, I had no idea who these fucks were and they just walked up and said hey can I ask you a question, and then started swinging. Anyways, I was fed copious amounts of opiates in the ER for about 16-18 hours, mainly dillies via IV and then some oral percs. 
I was prescribed 5 mg of percs without any APAP and have them to my roommate to dish out to me so I wouldn’t abuse them. He is well aware of my addiction and kept me on a very tight schedule. Unfortunately it was not enough and I was in really severe pain, mainly from my ear because they stuck a wick in it to help heal the fractures and it contributed to my headaches being much more severe. Anyways, when it came time to get my refill I didn’t inform anyone and took them myself because I was still in a lot of pain and wanted to be in control of my own dose as one 5 mg percs every 4-6 hours wasn’t cutting it. Well as I’m sure you can guess I went through 30 in 3 days. When that ran out I was still in pain and managed to find my old dealer’s number and have been doing black on and off since then. It’s caused a lot of problems in my relationship, with friends, family, etc. but I’m back in the cycle again. Withdrawals aren’t terrible but they still suck...I get sober for a couple days use for a couple days. I am thinking about trying Kratom, I have been reading up on it but I’m curious to hear any of your thoughts? Anything you guys would like to share on relapse, kratom, drug addiction, etc would be cool. Haha not gonna lie the first time using black was amazing, that warm feeling taking over my body and the instant relief. But every time after that was a mixture of bliss and guilt, I am no longer in really bad pain and I don’t really need opiates; at least not strong ones, which is why I am also interested in kratom. 
Well thanks for reading I love this sub and appreciate and responses. ",1511842104.0

I was also prescribed clonodine and hydroxyzine which I don't really get much from either. I was noticing a slight decrease in withdrawal symptoms if I took 1,200 + mg of gabapentin at a time. The dosage the doctor prescribed didn't do shit for me. So yesterday I ran out of gabapentin and only took 600mg at around 9:00 am. Today I wake up and feel like absolute shit!!!! I was sweating, hot/cold flashes, whole body aches, depression and restless legs you name it. I should also note that I took 10 g's of Kratom Saturday night, and 20g's of Kratom yesterday too so I could just be flushing that out of my system and experiencing withdrawals from that. I also have been taking loperamide every other day in 10mg doses. 

. I know I'm a fucking idiot for putting all this bullshit in my body and I'm flat out just tired of it all! I'm sick of all the meds. Take this to combat the withdrawal symptoms of that. In the past month its been nothing but IV heroin, Suboxone, Kratom, loperamide, gabapentin, clonodine, hydroxyzine and weed. I feel like my brain is totally fucked. Oh and I forget to mention I found a 1mg Xanax at the gas station today. Knew what it was the moment I saw it and grabbed that shit in a hurry. Of course I took it, passed out for about 4 hours.

. I guess I got way off topic. Anyways, the question I'm asking is if anyone has experience coming off gabapentin after a short use but at high doses ie less than a month at around 1,200 mg or more a day??? Thanks to anyone who has any insight.",1511840805.0

I'm in pain management and I usually run out of my scripts early, but I typically remember to put a few pills aside in case of a random urine test. Have never had any problems with this method before, but I forgot to set my usual few aside this month.

I used my last pills today (a lot earlier than usual, it was a bad pain month), but I have an appt on the 8th to discuss a med change with my doctor anyway. The current regime just isn't cutting it- obviously. I could be due for a UA at that appointment (I'm tested every 3 months and it's been 3 months), so I'm thinking of freezing my urine tomorrow while I would still show positive for my meds.

What are the ins and outs of this process? Storing? Reheating? I have a general idea, I just don't want to do it wrong.

And yes, I know it's terrible I don't stick to my script, etc etc etc. I do the best I can with the pain I'm in. For now, I'm not supplementing the script. I go my time without my meds. I'm just kicking myself for not covering my ass as usual.

I finished that shit and sat back down... and then, once again, attempted to smoke a cigarette.  I didn't gag this time but after about three puffs I felt ANOTHER wave of diarrhea.  ""Where is all this SHIT COMING FROM?!"" I asked myself.

I took one final huge liquid sludgy dump and felt a wave of nausea come over me.  I puked in the bathtub and nearly passed out because of how hard I was heaving.  Snot filled my nose and my tear ducts went into overdrive.  My stomach was real sour and whatever acidic shit I puked up made my throat close up and I had trouble breathing for a few seconds.

I cleaned off in the shower and got out of the bathroom feeling EXHAUSTED and DRAINED beyond belief.  I just crashed into my chair and sat there like a zombie.  Muddled, cloudy thoughts filled my head due to being dope-sick and my eyes found a point on the wall to just stare at lazily, feeling chills on my shoulders and arms causing my arm hair to raise on their ends with chill-bumps all over my forearms.

I finally broke down and pawned some computer equipment I own since I had access to a car this morning and RACED to my dope man.  After what felt like an eternity, due to being so ill, I arrived at my dope man's crib and scored a blue.

I crushed that bitch up in a Wendy's straw (shit straws, BTW, don't recommend them unless you want the straw to split and your dope to fly out like baby powder everywhere when you are crushing the pill within the straw.  It's like a conspiracy.  Alot of restaurants have started using straws with less plastic in them or something, like they know folks are using them to snort roxies!) and snorted that bitch as carefully as I could and then snorted a half-full bottle cap of water to get the drain going and to make sure there was not any powder going to fall out of my nose and shit.

I immediately went from being dope-sick to high but even though I was now ""well"" the sheer stress on my body from being sick was still somewhat apparent for a while.  Relief is not a big enough word when that oxycodone hit my brain that was crying out for the chemical imbalance to be corrected.

What an amazing feeling, getting that fix when I was hopelessly in withdrawal and shitting on myself and puking.

The sweats and chill-bumps went away immediately and my mood went from depressed to exuberant within a matter of seconds as the oxycodone binding to my opiate receptors caused my body to correct itself.

I was finally well.

Until tomorrow.",1511826886.0

Agents intercepted a shipment of Cyclopropyl fentanyl, a derivative of fentanyl, according to a criminal complaint.

Portland police said the package was linked to an overdose death that happened in Green Bay, Wisconsin.

According to police, 80 people have died in accidental overdoses from synthetic opioids such as fentanyl since 2014. The deaths are increasing, the Oregon State Medical Examiner's Office said.

Joseph Caruso, 33, was arrested outside his Lake Oswego apartment on Nov. 21 for the sale and distribution of illegal narcotics, according to court records. He is now in federal custody.

A U.S. postal inspector at the Portland International Airport air cargo facility got suspicious after picking up a yellow padded envelope marked “Knitting Needle.” The international package had been shipped from Shanghai.

The inspector said the contents felt like powder, not a knitting needle.

Investigators took the suspicious package to the Portland Police Bureau’s Drug and Vice Division for safe testing using a ventilated hood. Inside two heat-sealed Mylar bags, investigators said they found a plastic baggie filled with off-white powder weighing 27 grams.

The Oregon State Police lab identified the powder as Cyclopropyl fentanyl, according to the criminal complaint.

“Cyclopropyl fentanyl is a very powerful opioid that is ingested in microgram dosages and has been the cause of several recent overdose deaths in Portland, Oregon metropolitan area,” wrote Special Agent Guy Gino of U.S. Homeland Security in a criminal complaint filed in federal court.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Oregon authorized investigators to replace the potent opioid with a harmless powder, then send the package on to the intended recipient in Lake Oswego.

Investigators said they watched Caruso remove the package from his mailbox. Then, he was placed under arrest.

Caruso has a previous conviction for possession of heroin in August of 2014.

According to court documents, Caruso was identified in a Chinese Ministry Public Security investigation after Chinese officials busted a drug organization sending fentanyl to the United States.

“Caruso’s [phone] number was associated to a package containing 50g Fentanyl addressed to another individual in the Portland, Oregon on November 1, 2016,” wrote Special Agent Gino.

A search of Caruso’s Lake Oswego address found six imports mailed to Joe Caruso between October 2016 and November 2017, explained investigators. The international packages had descriptions listed on the manifest such as “SAMPLES OF COSMETICS,” “DOLL” and “PRESENT,” said Special Agent Gino.

Investigators said two similar packages sent to a recipient in Michigan tested positive for Furanylfentanyl, an analogue of fentanyl.

Fentanyl is a powerful synthetic opioid similar to morphine, but is at least 100 times more potent.

She mentioned that she only takes Tramadol, and that she has a shit ton of 10mg Perc's that she can't take because they upset her stomach. I immediately said ""well shit, if you don't want them, I'll buy them off you!"" Thinking she would wanna hop on that shit to make some extra cash.

Then of course...she bails on me last minute. UGH I was so excited to finally get my hands on some perc's. I was literally planning my week out and legit excited to be able to have some perc's to do before work. She said we can reschedule...but we'll see if that happens. She's always been unreliable, anyway.

If we do hang, I don't wanna seem like a fiend and mention the perc's again...but shit, I want them so bad!

“Sundays are always the same. All of the other days of the week are a little bit different but not Sunday. Sundays are always the same,” said Blake to Kenny. Kenny had just started running food at the worst Sunday brunch buffet in Jacksonville, Florida.

“That sounds like the beginning of a story,” said Kenny.

Blake doesn’t respond to that. He starts asking personal questions instead. Not really out of interest but more out of boredom. “Do you guys ever think about suicide?”

There is a collective murmur. Most people say they had thought about it. You can’t work at a restaurant without wanting to kill yourself at least once or twice a month.

“Why are you so quiet today, Greg?” Kenny was talking to me. My name is actually Grant, not Greg. I don’t correct him. I never do.

“I don’t feel good yet”

“What do you mean yet?”

“I mean I haven’t had my coffee yet.”

“You’re drinking coffee right now…”

 I don’t really know how to tell him that my “coffee” is a bit different than most people’s. I say nothing and walk away.

I walk around with a look of purpose for a bit until my relief was to show up. About 30 minutes or so. If you walk like you are going somewhere most people assume you are working when you work in a restaurant. The only problem here is that this is the worst Sunday brunch buffet in Jacksonville, Florida. Most employees only know how to do the same thing every week for their share of setting up.

I usually decorate the desserts. When I’ve had my coffee, it is done to where it doesn’t look too bad. It’s never anything to write home about, but nothing at this buffet ever is. If I haven’t had my coffee they look really bad and the whole process makes me want to throw up. Sometimes I do.

I go to the bathroom to hide for a little while and maybe throw up a few times. It’s really gross in there like it hasn’t been cleaned in a month or so and it smells really bad. I end up throwing up a few times. Sundays are always the same.
I check my call history. It had been 42 minutes since we talked. He had said 30 minutes. This is almost 50 percent more time than anticipated. Twelve more minutes than planned. Twelve lifetimes. Twelve 24-year-failed lifetimes. Twelve whole fucking minutes.

My phone rings. It’s a guy who goes by ‘Solo.’ He is a big fat black guy who I’ve never seen eat but I’d seen smoke a ton of crack. He also likes the same kind of coffee that I did.

I was never really sure how he stayed so big doing what he did. Normally what I would do when I saw Solo (which was at least once per day) is I would pretend to be a talk show host and pretended that he was my guest. I asked him all sorts of questions about his day to day life and enjoyed hearing his perspective on things like political issues and controversies that were going on at the moment. Sometimes he offered some incredibly insightful answers to my questions. Other times not so much. I enjoyed my imaginary talk show. I think Solo did too.

His life both fascinated and disgusted me. One time we were having our coffee in his kitchen, the set for our show during that session. There were maggots in his sink and an old pot with uneaten ramen noodles, or that is what Solo said it was. Flies were buzzing around the sink judging us as we indulged. Despite our stage for the day I enjoyed myself. I think Solo did too.

I don’t have time to ask Solo any questions today. I leave his car wondering what he might do throughout the day. He probably drinks coffee all day.

I walk back in through the beaten backdoor of the restaurant. I immediately go toward the bathroom. Locked. Holy fuck get out of there right now I will seriously fucking hurt you. Another whole minute goes by. Another lifetime. The door swings open. I go inside.

I close the door to my sanctuary. “It’s so nice in here,” I think to myself. There’s no real bad odor or anything. Just a good ol’ sanctuary.

I quickly start my ritual. No good day ever starts without a ritual. A flame. Some bubbles. A mouthwatering vinegar smell. A crimson cloud of liquid rushes out and flows back in. Bliss.

I walk out toward the dining room. Lee Logan is telling Alex and Blake something about “the circle of life.” This makes me smile. Alex and Blake look bored and disappointed. I enjoy the moment for them. Briefly, I pause and enjoy that very moment on behalf of every person in the restaurant. Bliss.

The restaurant is slow. Partly because it is rainy and partly because the food is terrible. There isn’t much to do for servers when it is slow especially when the mean manager isn’t there. Sunday is the mean manager’s only designated day off. Sometimes Mean Manager still shows up. She is usually sporting a mean face, albeit dressed a bit more casual on her days off. If she is not there she gets all reviews, food/beverage comps and other various restaurant reports sent to her phone. Mean Manager is a little bit nutty.
I’m standing by myself thinking about Mean Manager and a few other things about the restaurant. Alex, Blake, Kenny, and one of the high-school food runners are standing around talking about nothing in particular.

I don’t join the conversation but instead eavesdrop a bit. My thoughts were mostly about the restaurant and I fucking hate this place so eavesdropping seems better.

I get bored of this and decide it is time for more coffee. More relief. I head to the bathroom. Sundays are always the same.

I still have so much coffee. If I enjoy all of it at once it would surely kill me. I fantasize about that for a moment. Maybe after one last relief. One last ritual. It begins again. Vinegar on the stove. Red clouds in the brown sky. Bliss.

I look down at what I have left and smile.  A thought crosses the back of my mind. “I have it good now, but soon I won’t.”

Number one I never have done smack, don’t plan on it; I justify in my head that my habit is socially acceptable.  But say if you usually take three blues a day. Ween yourself down, drop to one. And try to wait a couple hours after you’ve gotten going already. Don’t just open your eyes and take it. Earn it so to speak. And then after that honestly I just cop a couple tabs just like some tens. Take you one a day till you run out. And by then, yes you’re gonna have some symptoms, but’s it’s not this world crashing and burning down or whatnot. Sometimes I like to cycle it. Go through that for like a three or four week period and then get clean for a while, make myself go through the WD. To mentally toughen myself up. I don’t mean to be rude, but man the hell up. I know it’s tough, but your mind is so much more capable of doing things than we give it credit for.

Again I understand shit happens, your guy runs out, you got no money. But that’s why I’m saying plan. Think ahead. All the old school functioning cats I know. They plan ahead. You think they need “upvotes” to make sure they’re squared away for the morning. No. They got a stash put away for that time. They got a handful of ambien. And they get up and handle their day to day business. That’s probably the biggest thing I can stress. If you can just make yourself get out. Get out of bed. Get going. Force a smile. It may be tough. Go to work. Get you a Red Bull. Anyways I have just been reading some pretty gnarly sob stories, and maybe I don’t understand it completely cause I don’t fuck with H, but that’s because I have a made up mind. I won’t let it get that far. I want to be in control.

I spent a year in a country with no opiates and I finally arrived back in Australia a few weeks ago. Today I was finally reunited with my best friend. 

I got 3 points of supposedly pure #3 Afghani heroin and nearly jizzed in my pants when the mail arrived. 

I opened the packet up to do some lines but was shocked to find this stuff was sticky as hell, resembling a gum of some sort, so it was impossible to snort  

I wished I had some needles even though I'd never really injected the stuff besides in hospital but I live far from a pharmacy so there was only one way

I wasted 2 points trying to smoke the shit off foil and failed a million times (also shoved a nug up my ass and took some sublingually to no avail)  but finally with my last few spots left, i mastered the art of chasing the dragon and was sent into that bliss I so dearly missed. 

Love, empathy, euphoria, complete contemptness for the entire universe. I have been united with a friend I have yearned for an entire year.

**Tinychat can be VERY shitty about the mobile app so if you can connect with a computer, that is the best option.**  
firstly, this chat is not affiliated with this subreddit or its moderators, and has its own moderators, rules, and etiquette. if you feel someone there has slighted you take it up with the moderators of tinychat, as it is completely unaffiliated with and not endorsed by this or any other subreddit.  
just a reminder and an announcement that a bunch of your fellow degenerate junkies, chippers, and tourists hang out in [our very own tinychat room](http://tinychat.com/ropiatesubchat) which has been an ongoing tradition for something like four years now. the location, for those who can't do links for whatever reason, is http://tinychat.com/ropiatesubchat.  

tinychat is an extremely buggy videochat client, but also the only one that fills its particular niche---that being, anyone who knows the room name may enter, and it has a youtube player. any technical difficulties may be addressed by the moderator, namely me. we like to hang out, listen to music, talk about random shit, and lately have even had our own resident sketch artist who draws random crap upon request. the primary purposes for the room's existence are companionship and harm reduction---it's nice to be able to shoot up with others around, even if you are technically alone in the non-digital sense, and have people keeping an eye on you. we're also glad to help with any problems you might be having, or questions you might need answered. we aim to be a welcoming, friendly space for the members of this subreddit to do what we do in good company without judgement. so stop by if you are bored, or just need to talk.  

if it appears like there is a moderator in the room but who is not speaking, just type a few sentences to summon them back. if you are on mobile it is not immediately apparent that there is anyone in the room. either click the button shaped like an outline of a person (i think) to see the list, or say hello to see if anyone responds.  


rules:  

1. pick a unique username. this is to protect other users so we know who is who, given the nature of the sort of activities we enjoy. 

2. no lurking. again, to protect the other users. if you come in the room be prepared to introduce yourself and participate for at least a few minutes so we know you're not up to any shenanigans. if you are lurking you will be warned and then given a generous ten minutes to announce yourself. if the time runs out, you will be kicked (not banned) until you are ready to come in and actually participate. if you are a known member whose identity can be confirmed, this rule is not applicable.  

3. no -isms or hate speech, even accidental. one warning will be issued, any continued insistence on such behavior will result in a ban. bans can be contested by pm'ing a moderator (me). this includes but is not limited to racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia. for example, if you are not black, use of the n-word, even with the -a ending, will not be tolerated. i don't care if your friend down the block lets you say it, it's not your lane. 

4. no auditory fuckery. due to peculiarities of the transmission of sound over a chat, certain echos and effects can be amplified to the point of being severely distressing. if it is determined that your end is causing an echo you will be asked to use headphones, or to mute your microphone when not speaking. deliberately making strange or unpleasant noises to annoy other chatters will not be tolerated, and your broadcast will be closed. (this only means that your video/audio feed will be terminated--you will still be allowed to type.)  

i know the rules seem like a lot but there's really only four of them, and only two that pertain to just behaving in a manner that isn't dickish.

My friend gave me an oz of Red Kratom three weeks ago (he quit dope a year ago using this method also), and tried it within the first 48 hours of withdrawals.

It’s really nothing special but definitely worthwhile, I start my day with 3-5 grams to give me the motivation to get me out of the door - it’s a subtle warm blanketing feeling reminiscent of my pills. When I’m mixing it with hot water, it has an earthy taste and has me feeling ‘healthier’ than putting anything up my nose.

I ordered some more online and usually take around 9 grams a day (probably 3 dollars worth?) and in the early stages I’d take it before sleep to help with my legs. 

It’s actually made me more sociable in general, I’m usually the opposite even when using, but it has me feeling alive. 

I’d highly recommend this method, I was wary at first due to mixed reviews but overall this seems to be the right fit for me. Cheers everybody ",1511922193.0

Tips?,"So this weekend I am trying Buprenorphine. This will be my first opiate use recreationally. I understand that Buprenorphine has different bonding affinities than other opiates, but for someone with no tolerance I should be pretty high. I also understand that this opiate is many more times stronger than morphine. I am going to take like 1-2mg intranasally. I might also add some Vistiril. I am buying an 8mg Suboxone, but after I take the 2mg I'm flushing the rest down the toilet in order to not pursue potential temptations. I am doing this because, I have tried tons of drugs like: LSD, Shrooms, Weed, DPH, Cocaine, DXM, Alcohol, Xanax, etc. I want to try everything in my lifetime, so naturally at least one opiate is on my list. 

I debated this decision for a while. I understand opiates are no game and their power must be treated with respect. As a result, I am surely playing with fire. But I have strong will and don't think I will let this drug take to much of a hold on me. Any tips for doing this safely? I am obviously nervous about this but my mind is made up. I have studied the consequences of opiate use and the neurology behind it for quite some time. I have also read this subreddit for awhile. I feel I am ready if taken responsibly. Any feedback is appreciated. Cheers

Edit: Thanks for the very rapid and supportive comments. I think I will pass on the opiate attempt (for now at least) in exchange for some Molly/MDMA (another I need to add to my resume.) You guys scared me the shit out of me as expected. Sorry if I disappointed people curious about a future update. Also might take people suggestions and wait for a more euphoric opiate such as Oxy's or Hydro's. Gotta make the experience special I guess. Thanks again and I wish you friends the best.

I don't want to progress to shooting. It's hard to plug when you're stopped up all the time, too. Does anybody have any tips to increase nasal absorption?

I can almost see you shaking your heads and saying ""But, what about the rush? What about the 100% bio-availability? You are really telling us we should stop IVing our dope?"". Well, yes, in fact I am. Allow me to explain:

Even though IV is the most efficient way to use heroin (it ALL goes directly into the bloodstream) your body simply compensates for this, raising your tolerance. So, within less than a week of shooting dope I was already needing to shoot as much or perhaps even more dope to get off as when I was sniffing. Not only that, but for some reason IV heroin lasts significantly less time than snorted. So you actually spend more money when you IV than when you sniff.

So what reason is there to IV? Well, there is a rush. A feeling of intense pleasure (or just plain intensity sometimes) that lasts about a minute after you slam down that plunger. Naturally, this minute of intense pleasure is highly prized and sought after. It is the best minute of a junkie's day. However, in my case at least, I feel like sometimes the rest of the high can be somewhat of a let down afterward because its never as good as the rush and IV is a LOT more fiendish, kinda like smoking Crack vs snorting Cocaine.

Mine was just being absolutely clumsy as fuck. I was in the midst of a couple months long binge and had been just chucking my discarded foil under a cabinet in my bedroom (still lived with them then). This was already clumsy enough, but it never actually got me caught. 

My girlfriend was over so I was sneaking off to the toilet for a smoke every now and then and finished a slice of foil that I was using. Rather than taking it back with me I just dropped it down the back of the bath. As usual my memory for the better of me and I totally forgot until I received a nice little text saying 'Your mother found some foil behind the bath. have you been smoking heroin?'

My answer was of course I did but not in a long time. That was foiled when I got home to find them sitting in the main room with a coffee table full of used foil, so many good time lain over that table. 

My dad knew exactly what it was used for but encouraged me to tell my mum it was a different painkiller (Oxycontin). 

Since then I've moved out and certainly don't leave any foil about when I'm back visiting!

Do most people on this sub Reddit get their Oxycodone from Pain Management or a PCP? I will post my story below that I posted before so you can get a gist of what I am going through.

---""Hey everyone! I recently tried going to a PCP since my relative said that she prescribed him opioids for pain. He has MS and I have a condition called Transverse Myelitis which is rarer and similar to his. She gives him a two month supply which is 150 Oxycodone 10 MG and 150 Hydrocodone 10 MG. I have very bad back and neck pain and I have tried everything except injections which I want to stay away from due to costs mainly ( which I hear is ridiculous ). I go to his doctor and she said she doesn't prescribe Percocet anymore because of the opiod epidemic and she could lose her job. She tried to refer me to Pain Management but I've tried going and it is really expensive. 300$ a visit with insurance. I'm 24 so I'm not sure what to do even if I did go to an appointment since I'm young and everyone is really strict. I have my MRI's and official diagnoses. I did havey neurologist prescribe me 170 10 Mg Percocet every month but it was two years ago ( he shut down his clinic or quit ). I did go a different PCP who was known for not giving narcotics but he still gave me 10 mg OxyContin because he seemed to understand my situation. I have also been to the ER and they don't give narcotics either but the ER doctor still gave it to me and told me to go to Pain Management as well. I have to mention as well I do smoke Marijuana and in Georgia, Marijuana is illegal whether or not you have a medicinal card. I have also been taking Kratom and it is helping a little but I've noticed months of taking it has steadied my tolerance and has even increased it. I don't know what to do next. Does anyone know with the right insurance how much pain management costs would go down? And if it is really my only hope? I've just heard bad stuff on how they're strict and if you fail their drug tests then you're pretty much red flagged by every doctor. I also don't even know if they will dose me based on my pain level since of my age and height (I'm short). Sorry for rambling, but at this point I'm not sure what to do. I can't even keep a job (lost three jobs) because of the pain I'm in and due to the transverse Myelitis I already have to deal with my nonexistent feeling in parts of my body along with my uncontrollable bladder ( which I have to wear a diaper for ) and I have this pain. Does anyone know what should I do? Sorry for rambling, even if no one replies at least I was able to take out my frustrations via text. Anyways thanks to anyone who can help!""",1511888822.0

I’ve searched some pain clinics in my city and I’ve decided I am going to try to get my own script as I have no valuable sources. I had a car accident a few yrs ago that left me in icu for a few weeks. As a result I have a metal plate in my head with about a 10 inch scar on the side of my head.

I was considering complaining about the pain, stating that the accident is more recent than it was. I have a pitch in my head to say to the doctors to get the pills. I’m not going to reveal what I have to say. Also note that I am going to target a shady clinic.

To my fellow opies, does this sound reasonable? Or does the fact that I’m 27 automatically destroy my chances of getting the honey?",1511888682.0

I've been having a much easier time than her (basically through my wds and hardly craving) but it isn't as easy for her. She feels like she can't live without it at least once or twice a week, which I told her was fine as long as she doesn't go overboard. What scares me is how fanatical she gets about the stuff when she's craving, as if it's the only thing that can make her happy. She cries over it fairly often when we're not using. How could I help her think more like me in terms of the importance (or lack thereof) of down and convince her to make time for some professional counselling? I couldn't bear to see her lose herself to the stuff, I've already had to resuscitate her five times in less than a year... Sorry for the bummer of a post but any help would mean the world to me.

The deal was to split them half and half. She did not have the money at the time so I just went around and paid for it in full and gave them to her as she had the money. 

Fast forward to Saturday evening and I count the pills and we have 22 left. I put the pills back in the bottle and leave them there through the weekend. Yesterday morning I go to count the pills again and there is only 14. Mind you, I haven't taken a single one of these pills because I've been going through my pink roxi 10's. 
I've looked everywhere to see if maybe the pills had fallen out. If my dogs ate them I imagine they would be dead by now. 

I've pretty much flat out accused her of taking the pills. Of course this went over poorly and she flipped out. Do you guys think she took my pills? ",1511886105.0
