Got quite a bit more effect yesterday after it knocked me out for a bit - but even today I've been feeling nicee. I only got a small supply from being released from the hospital but that's probably a good thing otherwise I'd probably use this shit quite a bit. 

To make this somewhat opiate related - it actually gives a decent low dose opiate like buzz + maybe a little speedy + maybe if I took a couple shots? And my balance was pretty off yesterday after I took it. I've got 1200mg left and would love to pair it with a nice shot of H but no $ :(. There's a whole PS4 with cords/controller/etc just sitting in the house too since it got replaced with a PS4 pro but it ain't mine..would love to take it and get \~$150 or whatever gamestop would pay for it but my family knows about my use history so it'd be obvious. Maybe if it gets stored somewhere and forgotten about..

Oh and I was about to start a new job right before I went to the hospital - did the drug testing and everything - and now I have to do the drug test AGAIN since it's been over a month and I used all of my fake piss for the first test...Been smoking weed everyday since I've been home from the hospital sooo hopefully I'll be able to scrounge up $20 somehow for more fake piss.

Fast forward ten years of sporadic use, sometimes months of nothing, then in the last year or two taking codeine once a week, I currently need 180mg to get that same feeling. I'm not feeling wds during the week, only feel a bit shit the day after, but if I take 30mg codeine now I wouldn't notice a thing. 

What's going on here? It's clearly out of my system 2 days after taking it and I've never done it more than once a week so why over time has my system slowly risen to a point where I need 6x more than I did ten years ago to get a similar buzz?

Am I just more used to it, and want a stronger high each time? Or has my constitution changed so it actually needs more codeine to feel the same thing? And if I totally stop codeine now will I feel any kind of withdrawals or just go on as normal?

I can't work out why codeine works differently from say, paracetamol, in that the same amount doesn't work on the same way each time, despite not taking it all that often.

Soooo many things I’m struggling with: the worry of how they will help me with the Detox off pills AND alcohol..missing my daughter immensely..missing Thanksgiving with the family..and missing my daughters 10th birthday if I decide to do more than the 30-60 day program. Will the meds they give for a severe detox like mine actually going to help? Will I still get incredibly ill and not sleep for weeks? I already told my intake lady that I want the visitor shot before I step foot outside of their door. I’ve heard that it helps tremendously for craving of alcohol and drugs. I know it’s not a cure all, and cravings will still be present, but does it help any of you a lot with your cravings? All I know is I’m ready..ready for the dreaded anxiety of running out of my meds early and what I’ll do about work..withdrawals holding me back on anything joyful in life..not enjoying life at all anymore because ALL my thoughts every single day are focused on my pain pills and booze. I mentally and physically cannot do it anymore and I’m ready, but I’m just terrified of not sleeping for weeks, all my pain coming back and feeling of emptiness and boredom. My biggest reason for wanting to get clean, although many of you won’t agree, is so I can become the woman of God Ive been yearning to be for years on end! My relationship with God, a better bill of health and my beautiful daughter who just wants her momma back are what drives me the most to get sober and clean! Any advice (as usual) is so much appreciated. Can someone ease my mind a little about the detox process? Do you at least have a private room until the detox portion is over? ",1540754123.0

This really has nothing to do with my point though.  


Lately i've been giving my Dboy snacks, for example chips, or i made him some lemonade the other day. Since i only use Friday Saturday and Sunday those are the only days i see him, so i always give him any beer i have left over from night drinking with my lady. He seems really grateful and since i've been doing this the bags have gotten a little fatter, but more important than that he's starting to be really honest with me, for example he tells me exactly where he's at or how long it's going to be, or he'll actually say he's waiting to reup instead of telling me he has it but his car is not starting or whatever stupid dboy lies they come up with to keep us on the hook. 

&#x200B;

Anyway i just wanted to see if anyone else does this, and also to try it if you havent, dealers are just like us and if you're out delivering all day to junkies it might be nice to get a snack or at least have someone show you they appreciate the service you provide.

When I started Suboxone, I was using at least a bundle of heroin per day. I was traveling hours on the subway, back and forth through NYC to cop dope. I sold pretty much everything of value I had. 

I was always behind on rent and on the verge of being evicted. I have a significant other who does not use drugs. Somehow we always found a way to not get evicted. Just typing the word evicted freaks me out. I have nightmares about it. 

I would get a job in retail, work there for a couple months and get fired or quit over something stupid. Wash, rinse, repeat. I was seeing a ‘therapist’ with whom I would cop drugs. I was contemplating using a needle for the first time. I’m glad I didn’t get to using a needle, but it was as bad as you can get without the needle. 

Now, I’m still on Suboxone. I’m also prescribed Klonopin. I started smoking crack while on Suboxone just so I could get High on *something*. I see my doctor every couple months. I’m rx’d 12mg of Suboxone. I fucking hate it and I run out early every month. I’m just as depressed as ever. I sort of put on a mask as being functional to my doctor but I don’t think he buys it. I’m not working and I haven’t had a full time job since March 2017. My partner has worked very hard and has a really good job that can support us both very comfortably. I am so grateful for my partner who has stuck by me since before I started using heroin. 

I don’t regret getting on Suboxone but it didn’t do much for me except allow me to not be sick between when I get money for dope. 

I use at least once every week, maybe every 2 weeks. I smoke crack every time I use heroin. I miss getting high off heroin but now I’m mostly just throwing my money away. I’ll use heroin and Suboxone together. As well as crack/powder cocaine and benzos. Maybe I’m just a crackhead now, I don’t know. 

Suboxone is definitely not the answer to anything. It’s like putting a bandaid on a gunshot wound. But I know if I wasn’t on some sort of Opioid replacement therapy I would still be using heroin daily.

Nothing changes if nothing changes, right? 

I don’t really know what the point of this post is. Can anyone relate? I feel stagnant. I can’t summon the will to be sober. I still want to get high. Something sick in my brain thinks I can just get high and have no consequences. I mean I have been very lucky that I haven’t had too many close calls. Knock wood, I haven’t been arrested. I haven’t overdosed. I haven’t been raped or robbed (aside from getting burnt for like $20 here and there). I don’t WANT consequences. 

I just want to want to be sober but I can’t find it inside me. Deep down I know I want to get high. I can’t give up control and go to rehab. I can’t lower my Suboxone dose. I don’t want to lower my klonopin dose although I’ve been forced to. I don’t want to go to therapy. I don’t want to take my psych meds. I want to do what I want to do when I want to do it even though my way has gotten me literally nowhere. Is that the disease talking? Is it a character flaw? I am just tired and sad and anxious and restless and lonely and depressed and apathetic and pathetic.

It almost seems like chewing in this manner makes eating far less efficient and far more work than you have to do.  ON TOP OF ALL THIS HE IS CONSTANTLY MOANING WHILE HE IS EATING!!! I dont understand how you grow up in life and not learn how to properly eat, at least for respect of the people around you.

It is so bad that I want to beat his fucking ass right now.

I guess I should be thankful that they lasted this long as I'm going on 12 years of varying degrees of IV drug abuse. It's a shame I didn't use simple harm reduction techniques more often, because I used to have veins that every junkie dreams about. I could always hit multiple sites the first try without fail, even hitting in the dark if necessary by only using my sense of touch. Those days are forever gone and as such I've been exploring alternative injection sites. 


Not gonna lie the other day I was admiring my white ass junkie thighs in the mirror and noticed that they have a bunch of thick veins that are clearly visible and appear to run near the surface of the skin on the top side of the thigh. Of course I immediately got curious and had to see if they would work for my special purpose. Sure enough I hit on the first try and registered a plume of red that only a virgin vein can produce. Everything went as it should without any surprises. I hesitate however because I've never heard of anybody using this area to inject their drugs. So, I thought I would ask my fellow professional junkies a few questions re: harm reduction before I get too excited... 


Is it even common to have visible veins on your thighs? Does anyone else hit in this area? Are there any additional risks of hitting here? Why haven't I heard of people using this area? 


I know people use the femoral vein - usually as a last resort - and know that there are many risks that go along with that. Of course this is not what I am asking. To me, the upper thigh seems like it wouldn't be much different than hitting in the arm. Am I wrong? Can I get excited that I just found a bunch of new virgen veins to play with?  ",1540704000.0

I had a plan to go but first I did some researche online and it did not look good, apparenly opioid analgesics were nearly impossible to get even for doctors. And after reading blog after blog I came to the conclusion that there was no Oxycontin or Diladid or anything that was not Tramadol or Tylex (codeine and acetomenophen).

So fast foward to today, I decided to look into the issue again and figure out exactly what the situation in Mexico was in regards to availability of opioid analgesics, prescribing, practises, and available products. 
Well as it turns out narcotic pain pills are available, but the level of red tape and regulatuons are draconian. Ill explain but first here is a list of available narcotic pain medications in Mexico.

Hydromorphone 2mg in 100 ct bottles
Methadone 5, 10, & 40mg 100ct bottles
Oxycodone IR 5, 10, 20, & 40mg 100ct bottles
Percocet 5/325 100ct bottles
Oxycontin 10, 20, & 40mg 30ct boxes
Codeine 30/500 

Thats it, thats all thats available there, but these are rarely prescribed even to terminally ill people due to the oppressive regulation. For a doctor to be able to prescribe these he has to,

1. have a special licence he has to seek himself that is only available in the state capitals of their residing state, and they need to fill out loads of beaurocractic forms (shit) to be able to get it. And the process can take months.

2. They have to get special prescription with barcodes that can only be obtained in the city capital. So the doctor has to drive in person to pick these up in the state capital and can only get so many, so if he runs out he has to drive all the way to the capitol.

3. Only licensed pharmacies can dispense these medications and they also have to go through alot of beaurocratic bullshit to get a license so alot of pharmacies do not even bother and dont carry them.

These are just a few of the hoops physicians in Mexico have to go through so many doctors dont even bother. The problem got so bad that Human Rights Watch did an investigation and found terminally ill patients were dying without proper pain management. Even in the ER morpine was on short supply. And in pharmacies, since very few doctors dont have licenses, scripts are minimal so pharmacies dont have a financial incentive to keep stock and there are routine shortages leaving people to suffer. The drug violence had supred this attitude, but I dont see how making these medications nearly impossible to get helps in any way.

Uncovering this really pissed me off, and I give these mexican politicians a stern 🖕FuckYou🖕 alot of these cunts are corrupt af and they have the nerve to place such restrictions pain medication. And to add insult to injury, politicians and their friends and family have no trouble getting these medications. Now I understand why my 2 of my uncles in Mexico died in pain from lung cancer and why my grandmother cannot get proper pain treatment despite having debilitating arthritis. 

Looking at this I am just thankful I live in the US.

If she bumps the sub up to 4 mg will she be able to cover the withdrawal?

Or will benzos help more than usual? Ie, she avoids them lately, but i think if she combined with subs, she would see a difference and appreciate them a lot if they have the kind of synergy i used to get. She didn't use them to get on subs time because they didn't help when she cold turkeyed at the last rehab. I know they used to have a great synergy for me but that was for getting high.

I started giving her a tiny piece every day because she was always sick daily, which was me not long ago so i felt bad, and at first it was like it gave her a free pass to use without getting sick, even if she skipped a dose of dope. Now I'm worried since she appears to be getting sick at the 24 hr mark since last dope usage, even though she is taking the sub.

Anyway i just got some h that was ordered from the darknet, according to my friendly neighborhood drug dealer its from the UK.  To my understanding, uk dope is usually in the freebase form, and ideally should be converted to hydrochloride or some other acidic form for best absorption when snorting or shooting, i thankfully stopped shooting but do need to snort it. My acquaintance smokes it out of a bola and said that this batch doesnt smoke as well as the last batch which pulled awesome clouds when i tried it, so he started doing bumps instead. I did a small line, about half the size i normally do and i can definitely feel it a bit but am wondering if i could get some input from people who have dealt with uk h before. Thanks and happy nodz.  

Edit: So i did a bit bigger line, still not as big as normal, but i swear that it tasted like baking soda at first, like it has that basic, non acidic taste. The stuff i usually get smells like straight    
Vinegar with a dash of something sweet or whatever is the cut. I can definitely feel it but its not as gsood of a body high, much more in the head..

i'm a veteran of Gabapentin use and know tolerance builds fast, however I can't seem to pinpoint when that tolerance has been abated.

THe number 3 melts to complete liquid and leaves NOthing behind its crazy ill take pics of trails later but ya whats your opinions what would you buy again more of ? Like should I cop more of the #3 or more of the GP? I know its like #3 is synthd differently so diff alkaloids and I am used to smoking fire gunpowder such as what you see here usually not as good as this current batch because I got a better connect recent hipefully that connect stays around but thats not my point or question my question is which would you want more of?

Be honest and also how yall doin I have not been on here in a long time 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

But yea seriously its like I cannot seem to figure out which is better, I mean I know I am the one with the drugs so I should know but ... idk. Its like the #3 burns completely diff from the gunpowder tar; the gunpowder tar melts to a beautifully clean golden trail and tastes so amazing vinegary and all that smells insane; and shatters to straight powder when needed and is sniffable without water. 

&#x200B;

The #3 though, it like slides super insane fast speeds and then its like it leaves a clearish trail behind like almost no trail and then last night I got so fuckin noddy that I woke up at like 9ish AM in th emiddle of my room on my floor all confused and my head hurt so bad I must've nodded out fell forward off my bed rolled and smacked my forehead off something cuz I got a black and blue huge lump! Shit.

&#x200B;

Oh, I pay like 300 for the 4 grams of that GP and then I paid like 90 bucks for 2 grams of that #3 and the #3 was an import its not from the united states but I sure am. Its the first time I ever got #3 bec in the united states we dont see #3.

1) if I rail my subutex tomorrow will I actually feel anything different/any high? (Normally I don’t feel any different when taking my 8mg just “normal”)

2) in terms of amount, I’ve read that some people get benefit/feel good after railing 2 or 4mg instead of their normal dose. Is this urban legend or reality (I think due to norbuprenorphine is what I’ve read)

As I’m normally on supervised consumption every day except Sunday I’ve got the opportunity tomorrow to try something different and see what happens but I’m not gonna put my nose through something if there’ll be no benefit. As I say; this isn’t a one off use of subutex I’ve been taking it normally for weeks.

They gave me a reason to live when I started using - I'm not a new user -, and that's how I got hooked. I'm aware addiction brings tolerance, which is an issue, but I can handle it in a few ways.  I know addiction requires money to maintain it, and that's not an issue really. I know the depression and anxiety comes back worse when you go thru wds, but I never go through withdrawals. I'm always mantaining.

You see, one guy on my Facebook killed himself. He just got tired and threw himself in front of a train. Almost everyday on my Facebook feed there are news about him, and what he did - and *why* he did - reminds me of myself. I know how it feels like to be so tired and unwilling to do anything other than lying in bed grieving and lamenting all day. I know how it feels like to feel lost and without any purpose in life. I know how it is to feel so miserable and distressed that you don't just want to kill yourself, you know you will and you'll plan carefully how to do it. I know how it feels like to be desperate 24/7.

I know how it feels like, and it feels hella awful. I don't want to feel like that ever again. I love not feeling that way anymore. It's been so long since the last time I felt that way, thanks to opioids. I don't want to come back to that state of mind ever again. I know that ""that state of mind"" is how I naturally am in my sober state, but I just kept using drugs everyday, every morning, every afternoon, every evening, so I'm under the effects of narcotics all the time - and thus, don't want to die.

And I don't need to get fucked up all day either. Sometimes I take 160mg of oxycodone, sometimes I take 10mg. Obviously 160mg is way better, but 10mg is enough to keep me from wanting to kill myself. So even with all the down sides of addiction, for me it's still way better than being sober. It keeps me alive and functional enough to work. It gives me a reason to live and make money - to do opioids. Whereas before using them I couldn't even get out of bed to do anything and just wished I was dead. Being an addict is better than being dead. At least in my case it was.

I can't recommend using opioids for depression, because that usually doesn't work. But in my case, if I am alive today and have any kind of peace, I own it to narcotics. It will be worse on the long term? I'm already on the long term in a sense! But will it be worse on the even more long term? I don't think it will, but if anything goes wrong, I can always kill myself with a gun or a strong shot of dope. At least in that case I lived years of narcotic peace and contentment before dying.",1540666474.0

Anyway, I was out running some errands, wondering exactly how I’m going to overcome my current situation, and happened to swing by a place I hadn’t been by for about a year. Just out of curiosity, I decided to check it out. You see, last December I abandoned a car in a business complex’s parking lot. It is a piece of crap. The insurance, inspection and registration were all about to expire, the brakes literally had stopped working (I was driving for a few days with nothing but an e-brake... in nor’easter storm conditions), and then the battery decided to also stop working. Since I had only purchased the car for $300 over a year beforehand, it was time to just let it die as spending even a penny on fixing it would be too much. It’s a really nice neighborhood full of yuppies, so I figured it would last a week at most without getting towed, and basically put it out of my mind. To my surprise, just about ELEVEN MONTHS later and it’s still there. Expired tags and all. Absolutely shocked, I pulled up beside it to see if anything useful was left in there. Oops, I had actually left the doors unlocked. Not much chance of there being a damn thing in there. Regardless, I rifled through the glove compartment, only to find an entire bottle (120 ct) of 8mg dilaudid pills.

&#x200B;

I've been feeling badly for 2+ days. 1 day ago I went to a place that does IV hydration/toradol/zofran that was a nurse practitioner. Spent $200 on it to avoid the ER/Hospital. It helped a little but less than 24hrs hours later I was vomiting at 4am-8am six times. All bile greenish/yellowish and foamy. It really upset my entire stomach. I got to the ER at 9am and wasn't seen till 11am. After that, I was in the ER from 11am - 6pm before being moved up to a room. 

No pain medications. There was a request to have pain management at the hospital see me for non-narcotic management which may or may not involve ketamine, but they didn't see patients past 5pm for that so I was SOL with that.

At this point I've been writhing in pain for days. I tried to go through the appropriate channels and have my nurse call my doctors to prescribe me something just to get through to the morning. None of them would because GI had a massive note in my chart not to give me pain medication.

Like I know pain medication isn't the answer but sitting at a solid 8 of pain for so many hours gets wearing and I finally lost it. I called up my internist and was like, ""what am I supposed to do here?!"" then, my GI called me back because I had left a very exasperated message on his voicemail and was all like ""we don't want to lead you back to drugs."" I was just like again, ""what choice do I have? Will a one time dose really get me back into or onto the drugs?"" He eventually conceded and was all ""fine one dose."" 

& I got it.

Plus, it worked - did it's job. Helped break the pain cycle and I don't think I need anymore of the narcotic. I'm just sick of walking around in a 6 pain score and then being treated badly when i'm in an 8+ because I made the decision to get off the narcotics on my own.

I have been taking 4 oxy 30's daily since I tore my acl in early August. Recently I've switched to about a qtr gram of fentanyl (snorting) which I've done for about 4 to 5 days now. Today I switched back to the percs. I've wasted so much money since the injury that I had to switch to fentanyl at times as its 5x cheaper than blues are.. anyway: I just wanted to get this off my chest and start recovering. My plan was to start taking subs whenever possible and then wean myself off. I only have an 8 mg tablet and an 8mg strip (16 mg total) to complete this task with which I think is more than enough. I also have about 800 mg of tramadol sitting around that I could use as well. My plan was to take tramadol for the first day or two that I dont take fent or perc with, maybe take 2 every 6 hours the first couple days, until I run out of tram, then take the suboxone. My reasoning is that I never can make it through the first 24 hours without getting more percs or fent.. I'm hoping the tram will hold me over through the 24 hours or more that I will need in order to take suboxone. I worry however that the suboxone could send me into precipitated WD when taken AFTER taking the tramadol. Any support or ideas from anyone or information about this would be greatly appreciated. I live with me GF but she isn't a user and she doesnt understand much when it comes to this so I don't feel like I have much backup TBH.. so any support would be very kind and taken affectionately.

so recently, every time i do a shot of tar and crystal i catch myself rotating/gyrating, subconsciously, from the hips on down. if I'm standing i keep catching myself just pivoting my torso left to right, rhythmically, especially while using the phone out doing something similar... but when I'm laying down on my back, i keep catching myself gyrating my hips, and when I'm really flying, i rotate the SHIT out of my ankles.. just little toe circles pivoting at the ankle, both simultaneously. 

i understand the concept of being geeked and fidgeting about (jawing, all that typical geekshit), but this is way more specific, odd, new to me and almost guaranteed by my subconscious if I'm not on my guard.

there's a strange satisfaction in it i can only really compare to pressing ur finger into ur gums in a sore area... the harder muscle contractions of the soleus/gastrocnemius for the ankles and the lower back fibers, guessing lower traps, have begun to yield some weird sensation that my body/mind seeks out pretty much automatically when i combine the two substances. this is after years of this not ever happening.....

i only have one question about it tho... DOES ANYONE ELSE CATCH THEMSELF DOING THIS WHILE HIGH OFF H AND SPEED? im not worried or anything, just can't deny some strange shit is going on w me and its so much more exact than just being methy and hyperactive and tweeky.. 

gonna do a shot of just crystal tomorrow for wake up and see if it still happens, or if it is indeed the combo.. ",1540632553.0

I mean what are the success rates of these places - 1%? 

The only useful thing I've found about rehab is that it prevents me from going out and scoring. But I could a random guy on craigslist $50 to lock me in his basement and get the same result. 

I hate the constant fucking 12 step/AA horseshit shoved down my throat. No offense if 12 steps/AA has helped anyone here - but they seem like a cult or at the very least a very unhealthy community to me. So much of it is pseudo-science, where are the scientific studies proving its efficacy? Oh wait, there aren't any. In fact, there's only studies to the contrary.

Half the retards in rehab think that they have suddenly found the love of their lives in the meth addict chick who they met 7 days before - they hook it up after rehab only to find that she stole your debit card and memorized your pin and down you're $2000 down the hole. 

The boredom - at the rehab I went to only about half of the day (12 hours) was actually structured into going to meetings, or having in house group counseling. The rest of it was spent - staring at walls. Real fucking helpful for an addict going through dopesickness to stare at a fucking white wall for half the day - I'm sure that that's not going to make them start thinking about drugs. 

The stupid ass random rules. One at my rehab was no sugar - soda and candies were banned. Because apparently sugar makes people hyper. Yeah - they actually believed that pseudo-scientific bullshit. That's not all to the pseudo-science - they believed that saunas would release ""toxins"" and help us detox. Meh, OK, lots of people believe in toxins and stuff. But they also asked us on induction if we thought that we had psychic powers - no joke. Also - no electronics - i.e. no laptops or phones or other computer devices, no video game consoles. The only entertainment we had was a TV and a selection of movies pre-screened to not be ""triggering."" I had already watched all of them before the first week was done. 

Smoking was banned, but people smuggled them in. I don't smoke and I hate tobacco but the horribleness of it made me join them in smoking a cigarette. Sometimes it was a quarter cig someone dropped on the sidewalk that we picked up and sneaked away when we were being driven to meetings. 

The holier-than-thou attitudes. People acting like clean time was like what level you were at on an RPG, and higher levels would constantly look down on lower levels as inferior. If you smoked a joint you were suddenly back at zero days - which in that case might as well say fuck it and score some heroin. IMO, weed shouldn't even count as not being sober - in fact weed helps tremendously in helping me stay sober. But to the AA/NA/rehab folks, nope, weed is just another drug and if you smoke it you're risking your ""sobriety.""

Most of the counselors did not even have even a BS in psychology or social work or anything relevant - most of them were former addicts with hardly a high school diploma, most likely working for minimum wage. But boy did they always know more than you!!!

The whole forced interactions. The whole connections to one another - you talk about how you'll keep in touch once you're out and be life-long sober friends - except deep down we all know it's bullshit but we act like it's not. You know that at least 75% of the people there don't even give a shit about their sobriety - they are there to appease their probation officer, or their parents or wife, or some are even doing it to delude themselves - but secretly they are counting down the days until they can get out and score before probably even the first 24 hours are up. And they're jonesing because they know their tolerance have lowered, so they'll be able to get **super fucked up.**

Every day you are supposed to act like this rehab is the best thing ever, that you're having an awesome time, that the people you're meeting are awesome - while in reality you're counting down each day and can't wait until you can leave these obnoxious twats and never thinking about them ever again. 

I'm sorry but before I spend fucking $7,000 to stay in some bullshit ""rehab"" for 30 days - fuck - just lock me up in some room and provide me with food, water, and a bed and I'll pay you $50. 

I don't mean to shit on people who have actually had positive outcomes from rehab - but 99% of people I've met who ""graduate"" rehab seem like they've gotten absolutely nothing out of it except a tolerance break. 

Sorry to be so negative, but there *has* to be a better, more scientific method toward treating addiction. Like imagine if any other disease had a ""treatment"" with only a 1% success rate. The person proposing the treatment would be laughed out of the building.

Currently trying to get clean on my own so sorry if I'm pissy, but getting clean from my own home with no stupid ass restrictions or forced interactions or other bullshit is 100 times better than going to a suck ass rehab. The only thing I wish I had is for someone to lock me up so that I literally couldn't leave. And if I wanted that, I could get it for far cheaper than rehab.

Just felt like ranting - I spent $7K on a 30-day stay at a rehab and honestly I just feel gyped in the end. And this was one of the better rehabs. I can't imagine what the Scientology or super Christian rehabs are like.",1540615282.0

These past two days I have taken Suboxone because of withdrawals from running out of methadone which I got from a family member. I am very interested to just go see a suboxone doctor and start my Suboxone treatment and finally get off everything. What I’m worried of is what do Suboxone doctors expect to see in your urine? Should I have Percocet or Suboxone in my urine when he tests it? I’m really eager to start seeing a doctor but I don’t know how to prepare! And last question when Suboxone doctors do dispense Suboxone do they give you the whole months supply at once or daily?
Thanks everyone!!",1540607043.0

At lunch time, I texted Church Girl and told her that I was home.  Coincidentally, she was home from work also and she asked me to come over because she was down in the dumps too. 

It was a beautiful Autumn day. You know the type - bright sunshine and a little nip in the air. We walked her dogs and came upon a farmers market. We bought fresh fruit and vegetables and cakes. We got back to her apartment and she offered to cook dinner. I said NO. because she was feeling down and I offered to take her out to eat. She picked the place, Roy Roger's, which was  thoughtful of my money. 

We watched TV and she sat next to me and after a while, she snuggled up to me and it felt good and right and so so nice and I knew that she had to be feeling the vibe.  She told me that she ""really, really"" (her words) liked me.  An hour or so later she said that she was sleepy and - here it comes - she asked me if I wanted to stay over and instantly - BOING - little jimmy was standing at attention.  Stay with me now. 

Church Girl went back into her bedroom and bathroom. I knew that girls like to ""freshen up"" beforehand. She came out and gave me a new tooth brush and a towel and wash clothe so I could ""freshen up"" too.  So this is IT, I am thinking, game on! 

And then, SHE STARTS TO MAKE-UP THE COUCH with a sheet and blanket and asked me if I like feather pillows.  NOOOOO NOOOO NOOOO. 

Then she fuc.. I mean tucked me in (her words) with a sweet and delicious FRENCH KISS. And that's it - a super sexy kiss and blue balls like I've never had before.  I left early in the morning and went to work.

Why me? Any other guy would have been balls deep, but not me. What a fucking loser and I am more depressed than ever. 

PS: This isn't an opiate story, but I thought you guys would like it anyway.

Sorry in advance for rambling, but I'm in a rare good mood and am looking for some of your thoughts on a situation. 

I've been working really hard at a regular, professional job for about six months now. In spite of the fact that I still go do what I have to so that I can get high every single night, the job has actually been going awesome, and I already earned a promotion. 

My boss's boss approached me today about getting me a company phone. He mentioned that a lot of people here get rid of their personal phones out of a lack of need for two (including himself) and that I'm welcome to use the one they give me for both purposes if I feel like it; there's no policy in place about what the phones are and aren't for. 

Obviously it would be great to drop my cell phone bill and my shitty old phone and have some extra cash for dope every month, and I am 100% certain that this is not the kind of company where anyone is making a concerted effort to ""catch"" employees behaving badly....they hired me before my felony arrests were expunged and no one even mentioned it, I've done heroin while driving their company car (so no cameras or anything like that), and they don't drug test at all, like...ever (thank GOD). Basically living the dream here folks.

Still, it gives me pause to consider exposing myself in such a blatant and ongoing way to that much hypothetical risk, especially since I sorta dabble on both ends of the dope game occasionally. Not in a serious way or anything, but like....texts are sent back and forth regularly that would not end well for me if somebody started snooping around. 

TL;DR: On a scale from 1 to 10, approximately howwwww stupid would it be to ditch my personal cell and use a company phone to handle my opiate-related business in addition to my business-related business? Thanks in advance for any thoughts on the matter!",1540597382.0

What else do you suggest I buy? I know I've done this a billion times but I'm just wondering what you guys suggest.

I'm going to get a big flat of water to try to stay a little bit hydrated some orange juice some popsicles some like Snapple and different drinks Capri Suns s*** that's nice and cold and easy to drink. Maybe some chicken noodle soup something f****** easy to make fresh pack of socks and basketball shorts and s*** maybe a couple extra sheets.

If you we're planning on stalking up what would you get? My brother is going to give me like 20 xanaxs. I'm going to avoid Suboxone I might take a milligram or two if it gets bad enough. Which I'm assuming it will because I'm coming off about 160 mg of Oxymorphone AKA Opana a day which are generally pretty nasty withdrawals.

In my whole life I've never puked during withdrawals no matter how bad they were but there's something in Opana that makes nausea and vomiting nearly guaranteed. I would love to get a hold of some phengren (sp?) but I don't see that happening. Can you suggest anything else to help with the nausea?

So at the time of this story my grandma worked at a casino. 
My uncle somehow got hired on the construction crew that was doing some work on the casino.

He managed to get a key or code to my grandmas register that had the chips you turn in for money.
Well he started scheming with another construction worker and they worked out a spot on the roof that was right above her register.

They came back in the middle of the night, cut a hole in the roof, and that guy lowered my uncle down with a pulley system they rigged up, like a fucking spy movie or some shit. He then cleaned her register out. 

Well of course grandma was heavily investigated since only her register was emptied and it was obvious that the thief had a key or code or whatever. 

They started looking into the construction workers and knew it was him right away since he was her son and has a shitload of prior robbery/burglary charges. 

Im not sure how much time he got for that but he only seems to do 2-3 years at a time then hes out for a few months before getting busted and doing another 2-3 years lol. 


Another time he had his friend walk into a bowling alley, buy a drink, ""trip"" and spill the drink and ice everywhere. About 10 minutes later he walks in to intentionally slip in the mess and land as hard as he can.

 He was tryng to sue the bowling alley and get a script for the pain but they somehow caught on and he was charged for that as well Lmfao.

Is this Flakka? What is going on? Am I losing my mind? I can get blues all day but they are so pricey that I need like $300s worth to even have fun and that shit goes in 4-5 hours.

Do dope dealers realize that if you are giving us this flakka shit or whatever fent bullshit that we are just going to stop doing? I feel like I am taking crazy pills over here!! Bring back real dope or I am just done with it. Done with it all!

9rjxdp,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9rjxdp/i_wanted_to_get_up_earlier/,7,https://redd.it/9rjxdp,sloan_fitch,I wanted to get up earlier...,"I got up at little before 6am and I wish I got up earlier, I wish it was possible but I didn't fall asleep until after midnight.

Along this phase of my recovery, while living the sub life I started experimenting with waking up early for practical reasons and to combat that bullshit sense of depression I think I have but isn't really that bad at all.

By getting up early I have all this extra time to think, to write, to read, to do whatever I want. On an off day this doesn't seem to matter... on work days it's nice because I have time to do shit before work. I work a lot of afternoons so if I get up in the morning I have like over five hours to myself. if I have work at 9am like today, it's another story. Before I started voluntarily waking up early, I would get up at 7am for a 9am shift. 7am - eat, shower.. wake up best as possible. Then shower and be ready to leave the house no later than 8:30am. This assumes no procrastination or jerking around/writing later than my ""cut-off"" time.

&nbsp;

I hate the cold of the winter, I hate waking up while it's still night out more than waking up early for work in general. Gettimg up early voluntarily on my days off helps to make it easier to wake up early on my normal work days. As I transition, as I potentially taper down my sub dose it'll be ever important I'm armed to cope with cold morning wake up routines. I've chosen that if I am to wake up early, I want to do it on my own terms.

&nbsp;

Although I sometimes have to work 3-10, or 5-11pm... when I have lots of days off in a row, or if I'm getting out of work before 9pm (preferably before 8pm) then I'm pretty much able to wake up early naturally. I started this experiment a little over two weeks ago because I had enough consecutive days off to acclimate and early work shifts scheduled to necessitate being able to wake up early.
Waking up early is kinda interesting. It's nice if you find yourself sitting aroudn at night wanting to sleep but unable to sleep... just wanting to end the day to start a new one already. Well, if you wake up real early such sleep comes naturally.

Logically to me, I wouldn't wake up at 6am if I went to bed at 2am but if I had to be at work every day at 9, I might consider getting my body in tune with sleeping at 10pm. 

&nbsp;

That's all I gotta say about sleep, I figure maybe this'll be of use or maybe not... but I haven't posted a grand post here recently and I wanted to drop in and say something to y'all.


Before I go, I ought to point out that I start my day with 2mg Suboxone and I haven't been re-dosing at all lately. Sometimes when I got up real early or had a long work day I would re-dose to ensure that I wouldn't get ""cold"" or ""the yawns"" towards the end of my shifts and unlikely as it has been proven to be in recent time.

This story has a happy ending after all,"I'm on a solo road trip through the south west, US. I brought some dope with me. When that ran out I cold copped in California with no problem. Got to try BTH for the first time.

I did the last of the Cali black last night so by the time I got to my stop tonight, dope sickness was creepin up fast. It's the final leg of my trip so I just needed a little something to stay good until I get home Saturday. I *thought* I could cold cop here pretty easily too. I've done it in much smaller cities.

I drove around all evening. Looking for an open air market spot or junkies roaming around that could hook me up. It was all off though. I couldnt find anything that looked promising, I felt fucking weird and sick, it just wasnt happening. I got to see the city which was nice but overall, disappointing. Finally at 10:30 pm I said fuck it and went back to my shithole hotel to try to sleep.

I'm wandering down the hall looking for my room when suddenly..dboy rolls up. He asks if I'm looking for something. I guess his dboy senses were tingling or something. I'm an undercover junkie. Anyway, I was fucking elated. I told him I've been looking for him all night. We get to talking and turns out...he only sells clear. He doesnt know anything about black. I'm crushed. It was just cruel. I had my fill of clear in Cali and it wasn't going to help me now. We shot the shit for a bit and then I sulked back to my room.


Of course, I couldnt sleep so a few hours later I go down for a smoke and his homie is outside and asks for a square. I finally find the chance to ask him if he knows where the black is in this God forsaken town. He says, ""Yeah I got you. Let's take a ride."" I didnt get my hopes up yet though. Not again. Apparently, his buddy traps 5 minutes from here. I was kind of expecting some sort of odyssey to make it happen considering how tonight had been going but 20 minutes later I've got my dope and I gave my middle a 20 for his trouble. I love efficiency. 

After all that searching and then a huge let down, it really was right under my nose the whole time! Shot half of it already and feeling fine :) Junkie jesus has been looking out for me through this trip. But tonight was a rollercoaster. Happy nods guys. Stay safe!

I recently travelled to Cambodia and loaded up on a few boxes of Dicodin LP (60mg Dihydrocodeine).

From Google I determined that these are extended release and not Instant. I am an absolute newbie and have only tried Codeine before (100mg makes me nod with weed).

I tried 60mg last night but felt almost nothing which I assumed is because it's extended release. Research tells me DHC is about 1.5-2.0x as strong as codeine so i was hoping it would work.

I honestly have no knowledge about these, can anyone offer any advice on what is a good dose or am I fucked since they're extended release?

I tend to get high only once or twice a week. ( I don’t experience WD) . However, the immediate day after i get high is the absolute worst. I think it has something to do with a combination of a lack of sleep and depleting the serotonin so much during your session. In my opinion it’s worse than an alcohol hangover but my brain is sharper than it would be with an alcohol hangover. It’s more in the body; laziness, lack of productivity, depression, I also feel more introverted and want to avoid people. Does anyone else have this issue and does anyone have any solutions? I notice it gets better if I allow myself to sleep it off for the most part 8-10 hours and drink a ton of water.

The autopsy results say there was methadone and Fentanyl present, but found nothing else. According to the coroner, there was no sign that my relative was a previous heroin user, but friends have given the parents very mixed stories, some saying that heroin was tried once, others say the relative would never, ever have used heroin. But from my research on methadone, it seems like nobody ever just takes methadone for the fun of it, but only to help with withdrawals.

The relative knew and had talked with parents about the dangers of Fentanyl, so it seems strange that they would have *knowingly* taken Fentanyl. But yet why would anyone just take Methadone?

The parents are just so devastated and have no answers and it doesn't appear that any will be coming. I'm hoping that someone(s) here can offer some insight into what MAY have happened, what sounds plausible, or why an informed and knowledgeable person, and from physical appearances and coroner results seems to have been a drug novice, might have somehow taken methadone and Fentanyl mixed.

The seller was a personal friend of the relative, but told police there was no involvement in this case, which is disputed by the significant other. There's nothing clear and there's no real 'evidence'.  There was a roommate present who wasn't told when the relative used the night of the overdose, and the significant other was out-of-town, also another relative lived in the same building, and there was insignificant texting between the two seemingly near the time of the overdose, so the overdose seems to have occurred within planned solitude. This relative appeared to be quite happy; their career of choice was taking off suddenly, and their significant other was about to move in. To everyone outside, their life seemed to be at a peak  (they were early 20s.). Nobody thinks that the overdose was intentional, but of course nobody else can ever know what anybody truly has going on in their internal world.

Nothing makes sense about it, and I don't know if it ever will, but if anyone has any ideas about possible explanations or even just a similar story, I'd be grateful for anything anyone has to share. I wish you all the very best!",1540494196.0

They are reportedly using **blue bags** and mainly coming out to sell at night. 

&#x200B;

Injecting salt is **very painful** and can be **dangerous**\-- at worst, it can cause cardiac arrest (especially in large doses). It can also cause bad muscle pain, bloody urine, etc. 

&#x200B;

PLEASE **taste test** first-- if it tastes salty, don't use it! If still uncertain, take a small test shot before proceeding. 

&#x200B;

The person selling this is not a dealer; however, he is telling folks that the bags are from a dealer in order to appear legitimate. I know at least 5 of our participants have already fallen for it, and while luckily they're okay, injecting salt is serious business so please be on alert if you're in the area. 

&#x200B;

If you/ someone you know has accidentally injected salt, advise **drinking lots of water** to rehydrate the muscles and flush the kidneys. 

&#x200B;

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions! If you are in the WaHi area (or general NYC area) and need sterile supplies/ naloxone or anything else health-related (e.g., wound care, HIV testing, PrEP linkage), please stop by our mobile site (Winnebago RV) at St Nicholas and W 181 St-- we will be there until \~4:30 for free supplies, testing, health services (onsite nurse and care/ treatment linkages), and more.",1540481947.0

From where I am at the moment, just getting stable on substitution meds rather than using both methadone and heroin would be step in the right direction.

The reason I ask this question is because I have suffered from depression my whole adult life. I have also, at one time or another over the same period, experienced the whole trifecta of addictions: drugs/alcohol, sex and gambling. I've smoked, popped, sniffed or shot pretty much everything except hallucinogens; I've had compulsive sex with girls after exchanging glances on the night bus home or wandered dreamlike through dimly lit orgies already knowing that whatever is about to happen will be remembered the next day in an absolute swamp of guilt and self-loathing, and while doing research for a magazine article managed to get myself temporarily hooked on slot machines in front of which I'd sit hour after dreary hour until it felt as if my eyeballs were melting and my ears would never stop hearing the dismal ""ding-ding-ding"" of the electronic wheels going round and round.

All of these addictions were a kind of self-medicating, of course. I come from a long line of addicts as well as depressives. My childhood is marked by traumas - physical as well as emotional - and when I've been clean, or even just cleaner, it's been like the whole pot of memories and heartaches has been stirred up so violently it sent things I thought I'd forgotten right back to the surface - hauntings that twist me up and leave me writhing around in a kind of psychoemotional horrorshow.

Recently, though, I signed up with a doctor and started methadone maintenance. I've been using on the side sometimes, but not always. When I don't however, I feel so completely crushed by depression that I seriously begin to question whether I will ever manage to be even remotely clean. I can barely get out of bed - my life is reduced to getting up, going to the doctor, then dragging my arse back home and killing time until I have to do it all over again. It's no kind of existence - I am suicidal, I am full of unshed tears, I am a complete fucking mess.

This isn't who I am - not all of me, and it certainly isn't where I want my life to come to a halt. So what can I do? I was prescribed two types of anti-depressants a few years ago, but neither worked. Does anyone here have experience of this, or anything else that might help me? I'm getting desperate...",1540476900.0

I was driving around my town today and just felt exactly how i used to feel. 

We live in a clown world. So many people feel empty, we have no sense of belonging to anything, there is no real future for anyone that means anything. Nothing means anything anymore. 

I dont want to work or participate in this society, because it is a broken one. Im tired of feeling insecure, inadequate and alone. If the NPC masses stand in my way of true freedom and goal of happiness i see no point in going on. I dont even want to go back to using anymore, i would rather just end this life (this is not a suicide post). Im just not interested in what being a NPC normie in society has to offer me. I dont want a girlfriend, i dont want a car, i dont want a house, i dont want a job. You know why? Because of the conditions that come with it.

I have thought about becoming a soldier but the military wants to give me vaccines (which i would refuse), and feed me trash multinational corporate food (i only eat a very specific natural diet). 

Now that im clean i can see what my use was for what it was. Just a way to ignore this oppressive feel and neuroticism instilled in myself by myself as a result of this indoctrinated views on sex, careers, money, relationships. 

Does anyone else get me when i say nothing means nothing? I think you could put a loaded rig in front of me now and i could just flush it down the toilet after thinking about it for a second. Im not even mad or sad. It feels like i could die right now and i couldnt be bothered to care.

So what im saying is that i would go back to using if i knew i was going to continue my old life. But im not going to. I feel like old me is about near dead. In a way, im thankful.",1540436292.0

I haven’t done any, or any drugs or alcohol whatsoever besides a few beers this past Saturday night, sinceJuly 24th. 3 months ago today. I overdosed a few days prior on a reckless combination of Xanax and Heroin. 

Cue a 21 day rehab stay, and then now a sober living home which I’ve been living out of since the day I got out of rehab. I’ve been doing pretty good, managed to stay sober...mostly as a result of the random drug tests and fear of getting caught.

I really been feeling some type of way the last few weeks, and said “fuck it” and went out and copped a bundle. It’s definitely mixed with fent, but holy fuck did I miss this feeling. I missed the warmth, the intensity, how everything in life seems to suddenly change with a bright, colorful tint on it. And music sounds phenomenal. 

I know the large majority of overdoses come from addicts relapsing and taking the same dose they were taking way before. So I’ve taking nowhere near the same amount I was stuffing up my nose before. In fact, I’m taking basically the same amount that I was taking when I first started using in the first place. I can not afford to overdose again.

I've seen a good bit of the opiate/opioid/heroin posts here on this forum (and a lot of them actually do look quite interesting/informative) and I do indeed intend to read through most if not all of them quite in depth. That said, I have a specific question that I've had for a while now, and I've even gotten it answered before but to varying degrees and and with some saying yes and some saying no (black/white, you know, everyone seems to be either up or down on this issue but none can ever agree uniformly).   
Now, I've been on buprenorphine now for quite some time and I used heroin for years heavily before that. mostly #4 powdered heroin (brown/tan and/or grey) as I'm from the northeast US. Now, I've always been told that buprenorphine makes using opiates impossible (it blocks them) but I've also been told that this isn't enitrely true, especially if you use a lot of and/or a strong opiate (like good heroin) and/or if your ROA is intense (like IV injection). Just to get it out there, for the most part I do like staying clean, but every once in a while I do ""treat"" myself and I get some dope and use it. whenever I do that I always IV inject it and I always feel it. It is always to varying degrees but I always feel it at least a little bit. this is with buprenorphine in my system (subutex so lots of buprenorphine due to frequent and high daily dosings but no naloxone) and I always feel it, just to differing degrees. Now, I am on the sublocade once a month 300 mg shot (I'm due for my third or fourth shot soon) and I seem to have the same issues with using H occassionally as I did when doing so while on high daily doses of subutex (oral buprenorphine with no naloxone, since sublocade is steady release BUPE injection but with no naloxone). Again, just for the record, if I use suboxone films (that have naloxone in them) I don't/can't feel shit for like a day or two, no matter how much I do or what/how I do it. So, the naloxone does work and work well as a full blocker but I always was told that just the BUPE itself was a blocker of opiates and the naloxone was just added protection as well as to ensure you didn't abuse the BUPE itself. IDFK!!. (hence, why I'm asking here, hopefully someone can finally clarify this shit to me).  


I know this may be kind of a stupid/annoying question for some of you and it may have been debated ad nauseum already in certain places. However, if you wouldn't mind (and you posses the proper knowledge and/or experience to do so), just to set my head straight and let me know once and for all what's really going on and what is and isn't just in my head or not (since I swear I DO INDEED get high whenever I use H, even while on lots of BUPE, be it oral subutex or this new sublocade injection, as long as there is no naloxone present at all).   
Is this the REAL truth of the matter (this is what I've come up with)? That Buprenorphine (with no naloxone) even at frequent and/or high doses (administered orally or XR injection, doesn't really matter) MAY block and/or at least reduce the effects of some opiates and/or when opiates are administered certain ways. But if you use certain other opiates/opiates that are strong enough to break through then you will still get high and feel their effects? Also, if you administer said opiates using an ROA that is intense enough to break through the BUPE (such as IV injecting)? And, especially so when combining both of these techniques/situations (such as IV injecting GOOD/STRONG Heroin)?  


Sorry for the long, boring and possibly confusing question, especially on something that like I said may have already been debated to death here, I just really wanna know what is going on here once and for all (I'm just that kind of a person, idk). Because, like I said, I swear I get high, to differing degrees, whenever I shoot H, even when on lots of BUPE (oral/subutex and this new sublocade shot) and I wanna know exactly why, if that's possible to know.   


Also, As a P.S., I'm sure the ""differing degrees"" I speak about are from differing amounts of H and in differences in the strength of the H I'm using (and also possibly differences in the amount of BUPE active in my system at the time, even with no naloxone) but I have also noticed differences in how high I feel when shooting H while on any type of BUPE preparation (no naloxone) depending on the type of H I use. Whenever I use Black Tar Heroin (which I have a few good connects for even though I'm in the northeast US) it always feels like it breaks through harder and gets me higher for longer than the powder dope I get (and I get GOOD powder). Is there a reason behind BTH breaking through BUPE better (and staying broken through)? Or is it just in my head? Or could it be something like since I mostly usually use powdered dope regularly anyway that when I use BTH while on BUPE since I'm using a new type of dope and using enough to make sure I break through the BUPE at that that I could just be feeling it more because of those reasons at the moment? (This one is extra weird to me since I've always read/been told that Black Tar Heroin, or BTH, is on average, generally weaker/less potent than #4 powdered dope). So, WTF is the real deal here??!!  


Again, one last time, I know this might be stupid to some people to the point of being annoying/irritating,and for those of you I DO APOLOGIZE. But I feel it could potentially be enlightening/educative and informative, especially to those on BUPE preparation medications/treatments (be it oral/sub-lingual or sublocade monthly XR shot, etc.) Because for people who do use H (and other opiates) while on BUPE I'm sure there is info. they should know to be/stay totally safe and to do it the right and safe way if they're gonna do it at all. also, when I KNOW I feel something and then I have people (even doctors, counselors, etc.) telling me that there is no way, that it's impossible, that I'm on a blocker and that there is just no possible way, then I just gotta know what's going on. Especially when different ROA's and also even different types of the same opiate (different types of Heroin) make me feel differing degrees of ""high"" effects than that makes it seem much less imagined, fake, and in my head and much more subjective and real. And, just like mixing H and other opiates with methadone (for those on methadone treatment) turned out to be, I'm sure there is a right and wrong way to mix opiates with BUPE (if and/or when you choose to do so) and that the wrong way could potentially lead to much easier times overdosing, so I think this is an important and viable topic, even if irritating for some (or many), again SORRY.

&#x200B;

So I have a drug test coming up in 12 days. I know that oxycodone typically leaves urine within 3-4 days. However, I consumed 500ml of red grapefruit juice prior to dosing in order to potentiate the effects. Doing so increases total plasma concentration and half life. 

&#x200B;

I also dosed 1500mg of tums antacids for the same reason. I should also mention I took oxyCONTIN. So no instant release. I dosed 50mg initially, repeated the same process with the grapefruit juice and Tums about 2-3 hours later and consumed another 30mg. I then did this a 3rd time (30 mg again) about 3 hours after the second dose. Essentially I consumed the same amount of juice and tums before each dose to maximize absorption/inhibition of receptors. 

&#x200B;

I consumed a total of 110mg extended release oxycodone over the course of the evening. 

&#x200B;

My question is, does anyone have a guess on how long the inhibitions of my receptors from the potentiation would add to the duration it will take to be clean? I was clean for 2 weeks before taking the oxycodone, so it was essentially a small binge over the course of a few hours. 

&#x200B;

I know, I’m dumb as hell, but google doesn't have any answers, nor does the search bar.

Here are some terrifying excerpts I've plucked:

Pharmcists can decline to fill based soley on ""suspicion"" that the medicine is for illigitimate use: "" (1) circumstances under which a pharmacist may, consistent with section 309 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 829) and regulations thereunder, including section 1306.04 of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, decline to fill a prescription for a controlled substance because the pharmacist suspects the prescription is fraudulent, forged, or of doubtful, questionable, or suspicious origin; and ""

...not like thats anything new, but it just gives them more encouragement to do so since there is a law that they can deny treatment now based on random thoughts in their head.

Now for the really scary shit:

“(2) The Attorney General may, if the Attorney General determines it will assist in avoiding the overproduction, shortages, or diversion of a controlled substance, establish an aggregate or individual production quota under this subsection, or a procurement quota established by the Attorney General by regulation, in terms of pharmaceutical dosage forms prepared from or containing the controlled substance.”;

“(i) (1) (A) In establishing any quota under this section, or any procurement quota established by the Attorney General by regulation, for fentanyl, oxycodone, hydrocodone, oxymorphone, or hydromorphone (in this subsection referred to as a ‘covered controlled substance’), the Attorney General shall estimate the amount of diversion of the covered controlled substance that occurs in the United States.

Basically this translates to: Jeff sessions can use the false CDC or other data to set any limits on manufacturing that he feels like

I wonder what Jeff sessions will do now that he has free reign to do whatever he wants. We all know exactly what he will do.

Once you've switched to heroin though, don't worry! the bill provides lots of things to make your life easier and make it so you don't get dopesick ever again like chronic pain patients do each month when they can't get their script filled.

That means strong effects at low doses, and withdrawal from things which shouldn't cause withdrawal according to most doctors. Kratom is a serious substance, but for my chronic pain the costs far outweigh the negatives. Even as I write this in withdrawals, I don't regret a thing. I regretted getting dependant on morphine when I was withdrawing, and for months before when the side effects were killing me (literally).* 
        
# To the FDA/DEA, you'll pry my kratom from my cold, dead hands.        
     
Making this post because normally I'd buy more leaf or tough the withdrawals out with weed and benadryl in mass quantities. I cannot afford a thing. So I've got
       
1 single 300mg Gabapentin.    
   
19 grams of quality leaf.      
       
13.5g of awful leaf.      
       
Hopefully I can space it out and I can be ""normal"" in class tomorrow and Friday, and but my usage is 6g (7g of awful leaf) every 4 hours when awake. 6x5 if I take the most doses in a day (which is rare) is 30g daily. This is down from 60g a few months back.         
 
I don't know what do. I can't go back on the pills, but I have insurance. Even if I got them, which two doctors told me they would back me up in getting, I didn't get relief and the side effects were hell. And then I'd have to get off then eventually, which was hell last time. I swore up and down I'd never swallow a prescription opioid ever again, yet I choke down kratom like it's my job.          
          
So kratom daily for two years now. Not just because it's better than opioids, but because when I take kratom i have a significant better quality of life. I've gone off for almost 9 months and it was just not worth it. Granted I had been on and off opioid like plants and opioids for about 1 and a half year solid, but I don't think that I didn't wait long enough. I know ""getting clean"" takes longer, especially the lasting psychological symptoms, but my pain is here to stay and I'm so fucking tired of hurting for no reason.          
          
I have been told by my friend he could easily set me up with product if I wanted to start selling weed/psychs, even saying he'd front it, but I've never sold drugs before and I don't feel like starting now.       
         
So yeah, hi /r/drugs. I'm sweaty, irritable, shaky, nauseous, and aching like a motherfucker. I'm not suicidal, which I find surprising.        
      
It really helps that I've got an amazing girl lately. It's not like it's not awful, but she makes me forget about how awful it is so easily just by being around me.       
     
She stayed with me last night through the first night when I skipped the first dose and instead took my last 75mg of benadryl and an old Seroquel to knock me out, was there when I woke up super early shaking and sweating and wanting to throw up, watched me take a small dose in the morning an hour and a half before my class and still leave feeling like death, come back to her still laying in my bed like an angel as I sniffled and sneezed when I came back after class to lay in bed with her all morning.      
        
She's coming back in a half hour to spend another night with me. I've never had someone be here for me through this, and I've done this many times. I don't feel as depressed or alone as when I usually withdraw.

6 year habit of long half lifed opium. Did 11 days taper of subs. Went 6 - 5 - 4 - 1.5 - 1.5 - 0.5 - 0.5 - 1.5 - 0.75 - 0.75 - 0.5 - 0

First 4 days were bad, but worse at night when the subs wore off. The mornings I always puked , couldnt put tootbrush in my mouth without gagging.

&#x200B;

Anyways, today is day 12.5 and 36 hours since last 0.5mg subs. I am only nasueas when I try to eat, and my only symptoms are feeling empty and blank. Theres no chills, just some cold sensitivity and sweating through the night while I sleep. Am going to work, but my eyes are always wet like I'm crying even though I'm just yawning. I can feel that the anxiety is no longer dooming and damning, but more like self-loathing now.

Then i got mad at her and left the house in only boxers and a little throw blanket. I have no idea what i did while i was out but I didn't make it home till 5am apparently. When i woke up i didn't remember any of what i had done. But when i went to get a drink in the kitchen her mom started talking shit about the night before. I told her that i couldn't remember anything she was talking about and she said 'i bet you dont!'  i appoligised and she told me that it was ok, that she understood why i did it but if i do it again that she was going to tase me lol. I woke up on day 8 after being blacked out for a solid 24 hours feeling GREAT i managed to gain 7 pounds while i was blacked out. I lost about 10 pounds from detoxing and gained almost all of it back in one benzo fuled night. And since that day ive been withdraw free!! Ive slipped up a few times im not gonna lie. I forgot how good herion actually feels. Ive been using for so long to just feel normal that I forgot what the drug actually feels like. I was amazed by how little i could do and still get so high. So the worst relapse ive had is using 3 days in a row and I still didn't get sick. But im scared that  im gonna fuck around and get myself sick again. Which is something i never want to feel again. So if there is anyone that still manages to use without getting physical dependency i would really appreciate your input on how much/how long i can get away with using without any bad side effects. 
On the real though, im so proud of myself a few weeks ago i would have told you that ill never quit, that i didn't WANT to quit that i was SCARED to quit. Now i realize that those are a weak mans words. I can't believe i let something so stupid tottaly ruin everything i had going for me. Before we quit we were useing minimum of 3 grams a day. And i quit cold turkey. Hardest thing ive ever done but i fucking did it man. If i can do it anyone can. I know that probably means nothing to the person reading this right now cause i use to read storys like this all the time and it never changed my mind about getting high. I couldn't find any reason to stop doing something that made me feel so good, that made everything ok no matter what, as long as i had a sack everything was ok even if my life was falling apart i wouldn't care cause all i needed was that next shot. I numbed everything out for so long that i dont know how to manage all the emotions i feel now. I have ruined lifelong relationships with family members and not felt bad about it one bit bacause i was high. Im not that kinda person, im loveing and loyal and will do anything for the people i love. But when i was high i couldn't care less about anyone but myself...thats the worst part to me about my addiction, i cant believe the things ive said and done to the ones i love just because i was so high that i pushed anyone away that wanted to.help or.took advantage of there kindness.. i only hope that i can find a way to get there forgivness and earn back there trust. I know this is anonymous and im a total stranger to you. But just incase this is someone i have wronged. Im sorry im so sorry that i couldn't admit to you that i was going through addiction. I still haven't told any of you about it.. im ashamed and feel like you will think im using it as an excuse and i dont want to disappoint you anymore. I love you mom and im so so sorry for taking advantage of your kindness. I wish i had the guts to tell her that myself. But im so ashamed of my actions that i cant even force the words out to her. Sorry for this long post guys i just needed to get some stuff out of my head and tell my lil story to someone. 
ALSO!! if anyone is trying to get clean and needs someone to support them through the process please contact me. What helped me most was when my friends would tell me that I could do it and that i was stronger than this addiction . And most of all the reminders that if i got high that i would just be restarting the withdraw process. Dont hesitate to contact me if you need someone to support you. No one should have to go through that alone. Something as simple as tellimg them you believe in them can make the difference. Atleast it did for me. I honestly would have gave in on day 3 if it wasn't for having that one friend who actually cares for you and will be there for you when your at your lowest. I will be that person for you if you dont have anybody. I literally only have one friend that supported me the whole way, and i will forever have his back and be there for him no matter what. I couldn't believe how many of my 'friends"" just stopped talking to me at all because i wanted to get clean. Its crazy how people can just cut others off like that. People ive been friends with for fucking years. It hurts my feelings even thinking about it as i write this. I really thought they cared for me. But they only cared when it benefited THEM. But when i need someone to help me through a tuff time, only one was there for me. Sorry i got off track, that just blows my mind how people can just erase you from there life. 
Thanks for reading!! Some of it might not make since but I needed to get it out of my head.

Let me explain, So i moved from my home town about 2 years ago went from a small town (population under 1500) to the biggest city near me, had no peoblem finding work i started installing floors for a 5 star company. Now i had already had a herion problem before i moved, but ill soon realize that what i thought of as 'dope sick'  wasn't shit. Within only a couple months the company i was working for recognized my ability to learn fast and my natural ability to be a leader. Within a couple months i was making twice what the other guy that started right befofe me was making and i had been promoted to his boss and was making roughly 750 a week. At the time i was only 19 and making more money than i ever had before and was running my own crew, only down side was the crazy amount of pressure my boss put on me to get the job done. Not just done right but fast, being the lead any mistakes would be considered my fault and my boss would send me and one helper the same age as me to multi million dollar homes to install there floors. The look on the home owners faces was priceless whenever i would walk in with my hair down to my shoulders and usually reaking of weed. But every time i would amaze the people with my speed and skill. My floors were beautiful,  they would show there gratitude with considerable tips, im talking i never got less than 80$ for a tip. during this time i was unable to get any h because i didn't know anyone to buy from down there. About 2 months into my new job i decided to try my luck with craigs list. Almost instantly my phone started blowing up, mostly people that were looking to score also or the messages from people saying they had what i wanted seemed to sketchy, one day i got a text from a guy saying he could help me out and wasn't that far from me. He aggreed to exchange facebooks and stuff like that to calm my worries of being set up by an undercover. After talking to him a couple days i felt comfortable enough to make a deal. I ask what he wanted to introduce me to his dealer. All he wanted was a half. Which where  im from would cost no less than 50$. I ask him about prices and this dude tells me 50$ a GRAM! I assumed that it couldn't be tar so i ask if it was cheese and he told me no, that it was tar. I couldn't believe what i was hearing, i went and met up with him after work we went to the plugs house and he took me inside and everything went great. When we left i ask the guy i met off Craigslist if he minded if i came inside to do a shot. He said that was fine but he didn't shoot, this was the first person i met that was a dailey user and snorted his shit. Not only did he snort it but he could mix a half gram with sleepanal on a plate with just a razor blade and a lil water quicker than i could pull up a shot. I had forgotten how amazing herion was, that first shot after months had me FADED it was so much stronger than anything i had gotten from my home town. It took no time until i was spending an easy 500 a week on tar. Because i could afford it i wasn't thinking about what i was doing to me and my wife. Not to mention the loss of drive to Excel at work. So i got in a pattern of working and being high the entire time i wasn't at work. Then one day i forgot to go re-up on tar and only had enough to do a shot when i first woke up, that just happen to also be the day that my boss made me work a 12 hour shift. By the time i made it home i could barely walk my legs were hurting so bad and i had extreme cold sweats and couldn't control my body temperature and was in the worst full body pain i had ever felt. I had no idea why i felt so aweful, before when i got sick in my home town i was just moody and mean and would get extreme diarrhea. But could still go to work and do my dailey chores around my house. Not this time, it hurt so bad that i couldn't even drive to the plugs house to pick up. So made my wife drive cause she wasn't as sick as i was yet, i guess because i was sweating all day and working while she was at the nice cool house all day. That was the longest 30 min drive of my life, by the time i got the tar i was convinced that nothing could help my pain. Let me tell you something, the feeling that i got when i did the first shot while i was sick, i could not believe the INSTANT relief i felt. The relief of feeling better was almost better than the high its self. This pattern of extreme drug abuse continued for almost two years. I was never sick again after that day. Then one day i showed uo for work and my boss told me that we had to leave right then to go work outta town for a week. I went into instant panic telling him that i needed to run home first and trying to make up amy excuse i could tp try to get him to let me go buy enough to last the whole time i was outta town. But he wouldn't let me go. He made me drive 6 hours away that morning to start the job. I had to beg my wife to bring me enough to stay well. Only one problem, she had just paid our billa for the month and only had enough cash left for a gram and enough gas to get to where i was. I told her fuck it, come on. She made it there by the time i got off that night. I would just sneak her into my hotel room at night and let her stay there while we we're at work ( if my boss knew she was there he would have fired me) we managed to stretch that gram 3 days and i had been working 16 hour days to try and smash the job so that i wouldn't  get sick. But that plan didn't work. And i could have finished the job the next day if i tryed hard enough, but when i woke up i couldn't even get out of bed i was so sick. My boss came to my hotel room and when i told him i was to sick to work he freaked out and told me if i didn't start feeling better that it would be my last day working for that company. 
I had only taken 1 sick day in almost two years and was late mabye 3 times. So it pissed me off really bad when he said that. So i told him i guezs im fired then cause im not doing shit today. Then he gave me a terrible look of anger and slamed my door. 
I figured if im fired anyway that i have no reason to lay there in pain. So i went and told my wife tbat we were headed home. Ive never drove so fast for so long until that day. I drove 120 for 4 hours until i made it to fimilar roads. By the time i had made it back my bosses wife was blowing up my phone. I finally awmserd and she say ""where did you go?"" I told her what had happened and told her i was coming to get my check. She sounded confused but said ok. Then came the problem of wanting to get well before i face the ladys at the office, then i remembered that we had some brand new parts for the car that i had bought the weel before but didn't have time to install. BINGO i went straight to the store i had bought them from and walked out with 89 dollars. Waited on the plug for like a fucking hour and finally got well. When i arrived at the shop the ladys started asking me why i left and how i got back. So i told them what happened and the bosses wife called me a liar and said that he never said i was fired and just told me to lay down till i felt better, which was NOT the truth, my helper was in the room when he said it. I had text talking to him about it. But they would not believe me and just kept calling me a liar. Then she says that because of my actions that they wanted me to take a hair follicle test before i could come back to work. It was 3 different test that covered every drug or sinthetic drug. I immidently told her that she could go get fucked And that i quit. She pleded with me that they would pay for the test and even pick me up to take me. I was having nun of it tho. Other people i work with have done way worst stuff and never got tested, like not showing up for work and not even calling or going to a job and getting nothing done. So i got my last check and went on my merry way. I had found another job within a week making 120 a day installing floor for a guy i worked with at my last jobs brother. He spoke no english and got upset that i couldn't understand him. But he liked my work. Only problem was that he didn't always have work for us because we would do jobs so fast that he was making enough money to not have to work everyday. This resulted in me being sick within the first week. I knew i couldn't afford my habit and pay my bills with the way work was going. But i said fuck it im not gonna be sick. Which made me get behind on bills fast. Within a month my landlord had had enough and kicked us out. We had no where to go but back to my wifes parents house back in our home town. I had brought some tar back home with us. But i didn't last long as planned and then it happened, my wifes parents found our box of rigs and spoons and stuff and freaked the fuck out. But they told me that if i was willing to get clean that they would support me through the whole process( she didn't know what kinda pain i was really about to go through) i was amazed that they were really willing to help me. So i got the box and all my rigs and stuff and broke it all right there infront of her mom. I told her mom that it was gonna get real bad real fast . She said ""it probably wont be as bad as you think"" . Let me tell you, it was worst than i even imagined it would be. The first 5 days i couldn't sleep or eat because my legs would shake to bad to walk even to the kitchen and anything my wife tryed to feed me i threw right back up. My wife decided that she wanted to get on methadone matinance. I refused to trade one addiction for another. So after 6 days of no sleep or eating just laying in bed curled up in a ball sweating and having explosive diarrhea (thank god our room has a bathroom)  my friend came over with some Xanax he had just gotten through the darkweb. He said that they were 5mg of alp in each pill. I didn't really care i just ate one. Shortly after he admits to me that the guy he orders from puts multiple different benzos and rc benzos in his bars. By the time he told me that i guess it was starting to kick in cause i dont remember shit after that. I woke up to a house full of people mad at me and i didn't know why. Apparently i took everything out of the fridge and ate whatever i could get in my mouth. And almost burned down the house by turning the toaster on its side and trying to stuff bread with shredded cheese on it inside the toaster. My wife's mom said she tryed to stop ",1540382690.0

I have been noticing this recently and wonder if it happens to anyone else. When I wake up, I usually take between 50-70mg IR Oxycodone. When it begins to hit about 15 mins after taking it, for a brief period of about 10mins I will get all hot and start to sweat a little. This only lasts for about 10mins or so and then goes away. It only happens with my first dose of the day. I'm trying to figure out what's going on at a pharmacological level. Does anyone have any ideas/have the same thing happen?

9qy4oq,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9qy4oq/sleep_on_suboxone/,24,https://redd.it/9qy4oq,msboobybuyer,Sleep on Suboxone,"Holy fuck I've been on it for 3 weeks and even with (for times the 15 mg dose I was given) temazepam (Restoril), I'm sleeping 4 hours a night in average. I bought some klonopin from a friend and the last two nights I've slept SIX HOURS, which I'm *so* happy about, but I need more sleep than that.

I should maybe also mention on that first night of klonopin, I took two ephedrine pills and two ginseng capsules so I would stop passing out at 5pm and at least be able to stay up until 9:30 so I could get *actual* sleep. It worked great. I mean, probably not the best idea because it increased my heart rate to 140 bpm).

[This](http://imgur.com/gallery/c4oCqZa) is my sleep schedule last week on Suboxone. The one where I got 11 hours of sleep was after 5 temazepam capsules.

I can't tell if this is the suboxone or just because I'm in so much pain from not having my pain meds.

I'm curious if anyone else had this experience with it. I'm on the 8/2 but started cutting it in half and spitting out the naloxone (as instructed by the shrink who is prescribing it because he said that has to be ingested to have effect and I'm not actually on it for addiction) hoping it would help both the insane constipation (no kidding, 14 days) *and* my sleep.

Fucking seriously. I legit *cried* yesterday morning with happiness because I slept through an entire night (check that link to see why That's a big deal for me).

Ps thanks to all of you pointing out I apparently know nothing about naloxone lol

Okay, here's a HUGE update:

I was in so much pain at work so I had to leave after two hours. I haven't cried in about five years, and was massively ugly crying after work because of the pain.

I happen to go past the prescriber's office on my way home from work so I went in hoping they would help me. They offered to ""work me in"" but I told them there was absolutely no way I could sit for that long. *They got me back immediately*. On my entire life, I have not had that happen but the fact that it took me so long to get to their window and was crying have them the hint I was telling the truth.

He had called in a medication that doesn't help me with sleep (trazodone) and had claimed he sent in a script for double the dose of my temazepam. He didn't.

But more importantly, the man who told me last time that I should be taking half the dose he gave me decided to change it to DOUBLE the dose.

So I went home and took two plus a 15mh temazepam, 2mg klonopin, and a zanaflex (muscle relaxer that makes me tired). I slept all day. And now, instead of walking like a cowboy who just got off their horse, I'm able to get off the couch without a problem and waking like a normal person.

I'm really hoping I get the same effect (minus the sleepy) tomorrow. Crossed your fingers for me.

I'm aware that a lot of this seems like it belongs in r/chronicpain but those people are 90% judgemental counts so I posted it here because you guys are great and actually know about Suboxone.

I love you all and thanks for the replies!",1540373874.0

I am currently homeless, I am also currently addicted to heroin. 

However, I also keep the area I camp at clean (as best as possible anyway...I have to make trips to dumpsters with my trash but I never let it build up to extreme levels) and I don't commit crime (aside from purchasing heroin and camping in city limits... both crimes that hurt no one but myself).

People commenting on that Facebook post were advocating for all homeless people to be rounded up and thrown into a barbed wire enclosure until they can ""conform"" to society, they were saying all homeless people don't want help and just want to rob and steal, people were commenting that addicts dont have a disease - they're just making an active descion to use drugs, among other nasty things.

From an outside perspective I can totally see how someone might look at an addict and think they're making the choice to use drugs and ruin their lives consciously and can stop anytime they want. Until I became addicted to heroin, I thought the same thing. Let me tell you though, addiction is a powerful thing as I'm sure most on this sub realize. It's an altering of your brain, your reward system gets completely hijacked and you're never going to be the same as before you became addicted.

I feel like a lot of people look at the homeless and those with addiction issues as second class citizens. They lump them all together. I know there are bad people out there who also happen to be homeless or an addict but there are also good people who do want help and don't commit crimes against other people and don't deserve to be treated like dirt. The constant stares, the comments about how maybe you look dirty or smell bad. It hurts to experience these things and if people want more addicts to recover and more homeless people to get homes and jobs and live lives beneficial to the rest of society, they need to start opening their hearts and treating these people like they would like to be treated.

I'm tired of people calling the cops when they see someone sleeping somewhere in public. How are they hurting you? Just stop it. Mind your own business and let the cops take care of violent criminals instead of having to shuffle people along to appease you for some dumbass reason.

I Feel Fucked And Raped. What do I do? [TL;DR in there]","So I went to my new primary care physician (3rd visit) & really cried out for help because my psychiatrist of 7 years won’t increase my Valium dosage (2mg x3 daily....). Told my psychiatrist that the 10mg Valium my dentist gave me for extreme dental phobia (single tablet written each visit) worked better than the Ativan he had me on for all these years, & it doesn’t impair me, & he freaked out saying “oh no that’s way too much, it’s all the same!! 2mg Valium twice a day is plenty!” Then next visit: “You are lucky to have me increase it to 2mg three times a day for you!”

Considering that, I explained to my physician how my psychiatrist is handling this issue I’m having & my physician tells me: “I can’t write you a benzo you’re going to have to discuss this with your psychiatrist” right after I just explained all of what my psychiatrist is doing...

*My this physician sees & is aware that I’m prescribed ZOLOFT-100MGx1, ADDERALL-20MGx2, VALIUM-2MGx3, SUBOXONE-1MGx2 on his chart as far as my psyche meds go & asks me “have you tried BUSPAR?”, “yes it gave me facial twitches & I also tried just about every SSRI,SNRI,TCAs,etc., over the 7 years with my psychiatrist to find which meds helped me the most, but he’s not adjusting the Valium to the dose I respond well to”

“Well, I’m going to give you some Lexapro, itlll work great for you! Start by breaking the pill into little pieces and take more and more each day! You’ll feel better”. I tell him, but I’ve been on it at 14 & felt extremely suicidal a few days in on it & which went away when I stopped, and also from my knowledge wouldn’t the Lexapro interact with the Zoloft because they’re both SSRI antidepressants??” 
He tells me “no Lexapro isn’t an antidepressant or any of that, it’s used for the exact symptoms of panic & anxiety you’re having. It’s an anxiety pill you’ll be ok, come back and 3 months you’ll feel better when I see you next, and make sure you get your blood work & follow up with the orthopedic surgeon for you neck pain issue”*

Unless I’m crazy and there’s something I’m missing, shouldn’t this doctor know what kind of medicine he’s writing in the first place? Second, he’s not aware that Zoloft and Lexapro are in the same class & there’s too many serious risks of mixing two SSRI’s on top of being on Adderall & Suboxone which impact serotonin as well... thirdly, as I sit there waiting in his office, I hear just about half of the waiting room talking about how long they’ve been waiting how they need to get their Percocet cause they have people waiting to buy it, another guy talking about trading his bars for Percocet everybody all loud and loose without a care in the world saying all of this shit loudly in front of the receptionist, I’m sitting there quietly panicking looking like I have a disability, and the doctor keeps his office door open & I could hear the patients from in there so this “physician” really sounds like he’s not taking his career in medicine seriously... xannie bars & percs to dealers; 
patient with panic disorder w/ Agoraphobia, general/social anxiety disorder, ADHD, OCD, PTSD, blood pressure reading of around 160/95 & 130 bears per minute sitting: cannot help me with an increase of Valium which is still a very small dose even if written at 10mg x3 daily... not even another benzo in mind... add on lexapro to Zoloft Adderall and Suboxone...

Sorry for sounding so Bitchy but everytime I reach out for help and explain what’s helped & what hasn’t, I feel so mistreated & disregarded yet I respect the doctor, I don’t respond until he’s done talking, I even walk out with a respectful goodbye, a compliment for him & thank him even though I felt like arguing back & getting loud with a doctor for the first time in my entire life.. 

What the hell does it truly take to get a benzo prescription when you need it & or rather the med works fine but the dosage doesn’t? I’m not even trying to get Xanax because Xanax doesn’t work for me. What the hell am I doing wrong? Am I not overacting enough; do I have to do the “overly-stressed-out-housewife-and-full-time-mommy-of-14-children-and-threatening-to-murder-my-husband-unless-I-take-something-stronger-than-pill-that-can-knock-out-an-elephant-because-my-nerves-are-so-shot-out-24/7-I-can’t-live-my-life-maybe-I-need-a-small-dose-of-Xanax-2MG-about-7-times-a-day-doctor!”approach?

PS: when my grandma was alive she gave me her Valium 10mg x90 every month (free, she no longer needed it & saw me suffering playing lab rat with psychiatrist trying too many meds) at 14 years old; gave me instructions on how to take it, and never once have I abused it until I lost my dad, my mom, and my grandma (84) when I was 18 and was offered my first Oxycodone. Now I’m 20, I’ll be 6 months clean & stable except I don’t have mom, dad, Grammy & her loving care + her dosage Valium that lasted me just over 30 days. Thats why I really need that dosage & amount again because I was living a normal life with it & idk what to do to get my doc or a doc to increase the little 2mg Valium I’m on to 10mg Valium 

*TL;DR: psyche-doc gives me 
Valium 2mg x3 and won’t increase dose at all b/c “10mg way too much!!”, so I talk to primary care doc about this issue & he says “me no write benzos to U! talk to psyche-doc about that” after explaining how I already discussed with psyche-doc.. primary care doc writes me Lexapro knowing I’m prescribed Zoloft by psyche-doc and I tell him I tried many SSRI, TCAs, etc. and how Lexapro made me suicidal; I also ask if it’s even safe to take Lexapro + Zoloft together in the 1st place because they’re both SSRI antidepressants. He tells me “nah Lexapro isn’t SSRI or antidepressant, it’s only used for specifically panic/social anxiety, and it’s & anxiety pill that will 100% work, when I see you next appointment in 3 months you’ll feel great/so much better!” I respectfully thank him for his amazing practice & for helping me with this! “That’s what I’m here for, to be your doctor!”..... crazy or what? How do I get my Valium increased to the dose that works perfectly for me? It seems I have no luck at all or I must be saying something wrong or being too nice???

I ordered a TON of seeds in the mail, before testing their new seeds out because they’re out of their usual kind. So, my first shipment comes in the day I ran out of my own meds. I use them that evening, cuz my morning meds were wore off and I wanted sleep. I was so exhausted I thought they worked well cuz I slept pretty well that night. Wellll..WRONG!

The next day I had nothing except for my seeds to use as meds and they were complete TRASH! Before I knew they were complete TRASH, I ordered 8 ducking POUNDS, so now I’m sitting on 8 lbs of complete garbage! 

Also realized Thursday night, I got so trashed and was so pisses of this garbage trash, that I ordered another 4 lbs from a completely different vendor I’ve never tried before, because I was desperate. The 2 day of not having my meds and taking only kratom (doesn’t work well for me) I decided to take the last of my Loperamide I had left and just finish the bottle of like 60 something. BIG MISTAKE!!!
I have tried lope in the past, but to no avail of relief. I’m now on day, like, 3 of nothing but lope (I’ve decreased every day) and each “dose” lasts me literally 24 hours!! Why the HECK didn’t I not know how well these had a potential to get a person not only out of withdrawals, but HIGH!?! Now I’m sitting on 10 lbs of seeds I don’t wanna use, about to head to rehab within the left 2 weeks, and found out I can get high on loperamide!?! Talk about HORRIBLE timing! 🤦🏻‍♀️😔

FYI, I have a HIGE tolerance to pain pills, so how is this even possible!?! Someone please explain!

(only prescribed b/c I was forced off prescribed opioids 4yrs back due 2new rules @ docs; used forHIV, accelerated arthritis, muscle inflammation, scoliosis, severe pain)","Title above basically explains it - I’m constantly in pain and I’m tired of suffering everyday unable to function like a normal young adult since rules started changing about HIV pain treatment and I was forced off my prescription opioids due to blatant mass hysteria. I’m looking at a prostate cancer diagnosis in a two weeks after my emergency biopsy to get the final oncological results. The PSA test results were very high for my age and the other tests ruled out all infection or kidney damage, the emergency MRI cleared the risk of it spreading to my bones, but the emergency CT scan and internal checks showed that the organ is massive, quite solid like a rock, and much larger on the right side - so large that it pulled both my groin muscles after I got the flu shot and it puffed up exponentially. It was almost like the flu shot made the cancer grow in size - God knows I’m never getting that health-destroying “vaccine” ever again. I’m truly hoping that this is one of the strangest cases of BPH ever known to man, but with my luck.. it’s not likely. This is why I’m so frightened and need to know if I’m going to be forced to suffer through cancer treatments on top of the miserable side effects and new ailments that plague me due to my HIV antiviral treatment drugs and the disease itself, all because I did the right thing and went on buprenorphine (3x 8mg 84 a month) when my primary care’s rules changed about oxycodone and made me see specialists that only denied me even though I was willing to take as many drug tests and pill checks needed! I’m tired of feeling like I’m 100 years old in a young persons body.. I just don’t want to feel anything when I’m dying and I just don’t want to suffer through the end and I don’t know what I’ll do if they tell me I can’t get pain blocking treatments.. the buprenorphine stopped working effectively for my pain at least 2 years ago now. Fucking fuck - I’m so tired of feeling like I’m dying slowly every single day and I constantly pray for relief and I feel like God just decided to kill me instead with every nasty and horrible disease in the book... I hope that once I’m dead, I feel nothing and sleep for eternity and the pain disappears - I can’t even explain how difficult the past 5 years have been for me healthwise, but I’ve learned so much in process too and for that,  I’m thankful. I’m no needle jammer either - no.. I got HIV from some fucking asshole lier who I also happened to fall in love with, who also happens to reside in my home state where the HIV spreader is criminally/legally protected for life... Fucking liberals man, destroying our world inch by inch. Anyways.. I just need to know if I’m going to be fucked when it comes to finally getting some pain relief because I don’t want to feel anything when I’m dying.

I started with about 15 g a day (2.5 g six times) a few days ago, but now am doing 30 g a day (10 grams three times)]. My pain is the lowest it has been in ages, my opioid withdrawal is completely mitigated - even better than it was when I lived in the US and was on methadone - and I feel great: not incredibly high, mind you, but very comfortable and relaxed.

I really struggle to take care of myself when on the opioid rollercoaster: for example, I usually - when my addiction / dependence is managed properly - try to eat very healthy and exercise regularly, as well as engage in a variety of academic research and pursuits that I love. When my addiction is not properly managed and I go even into mild withdrawal, feeding myself becomes too hard so I just lay there hating myself and life.

For any kratom users here: have you experienced any long term detrimental side effects?

I'm just so incredibly impressed with it and am loving it. I haven't been this productive and comfortable in ages. (I've felt mildly physically uncomfortable all my life, always too hot and too cold and sweaty and just off. Opioids cure that.)

I've read a few cases of liver failure, which kind of frightens me, so I'd like to know how common / realistic this is (my liver's a little rough to start with and needs some light care) before I continue on with this. I've been using it for only five days now and am trying to plan ahead and decide if this will be a long-term opioid dependency management tool (as I would do with methadone of subs if they were available here), or a tool to wean myself off of opioids.

Best of all, it isn't awful like the trammies I get here. I hate them... they do nothing for pain, they don't feel remotely fun, and their only use is managing my primary addiction, which is to buprenorphine patches.",1540338796.0

I just really need some advice or ideas. I'm sorry if this is against the rules i just really need some help.

So a few weeks ago I was told to I had to take a random drug test for my job. I wasn't worried because the only thing I take are perks and i have a script for them and i hadn't even taken them recently. So I get a call this morning with the people saying that I test positive for H. I told them that its not possible for that and the doctor on the phone even said that the amount in my system wasn't indicative of a user, it was way lower and barely even popped the test. Apparently the cut off is 10 parts per billion and I was at 18 and a user would be in the hundreds or something like that according to him. He even said that it seemed weird and asked me if there was a chance that i was exposed to it because it was such a low amount that I could have been accidentally exposed to it somehow. The thing is i don't know how that is possible. I was at the bar the night before and was also at my friends house who i know actually uses but he didn't even do any while i was there and that was 12 hours before my test even happened. I'm trying to figure out how this could even happen. Does anyone have any ideas? Could I have been exposed to smoke somewhere or somehow my friends house 'contaminated' me? The only other thing i can think of that the house that I live at is a place i found on craigslist and i share it with 7 other people(each person has their own room) and my room has the main ac output vent. Is it possible that someone else in the house using drugs could make it get into my system? My computer is right under the vent and that's where i spend all of my time. Has anyone ever heard of something like this happening?

They've already fired me and they said i can pay to have the sample retested but they wont let me retake it. I want to see if there is any way I could fight this legally and get my job back because i know that I didn't use H and I don't want to lose my job over this shit. I want to see if there is anyway i could make them let me retake so i could show that maybe it was accidentally exposure or something like that and that my levels would be 0(but i guess that wouldn't matter if its in there air where i live but i dont even think that is possible is it?).

* I once helped my friend scrap his air conditioner in May because he wasn't using it yet that year (we got $7 for it). 
* I had a route mapped out through the city I live in that would take me by all of the pawn shops in the city getting progressively closer to the neighborhood i could cop in.  
* Used to know a guy (he recently passed at 26) who was banned from almost every store in the area for either selling them stolen merch or stealing and returning items. Banned from -  2 Home Depots, 1 Lowes, a consignment shop, EVERY WALMART and more I don't remember.
* I knew a girl that worked at Home Depot in a rough neighborhood and she was typically stationed at the return counter. Home Depot does cash returns and usually takes anything back, even without a receipt, making them a perfect target for junkies. She said there was a group of regulars she recognized who would be in once a week or even every few days to return stuff. One was a girl who's dad was a contractor, she would constantly steal materials from his warehouse (copper pipe, saw blades etc) and return them the day after he bought the stuff. There was even one instance where someone was trying to return a stolen circular saw- THEY DIDN'T EVEN TAKE IT OUT OF THE STORE! They took it off the shelf and went right to the return counter with it. CAN YOU IMAGINE THE SIZE OF THE BALLS ON THIS PERSON! LOL

Never thought I would be so excited for something that should ultimately help me actually remain abstinent from opiates.

So I submitted my paperwork @ the Dr's office about 2 weeks ago and since I'm going back in tomorrow to go over my blood work results (they are also my GP) I decided to call InSupport to see if I could get a status on the CoPay assistance program.

Well, according to them I was approved! That means the monthly cost for my meds should be just $5 (I only pay $10 now), but I will be on the monthly sublocade injection.

Anyway, just got super giddy/excited hearing I was approved and wanted to share. I will ask tomorrow what the plan is, I doubt they already have the medication, but if they gave me the option I would like to start ASAP.

I'm guessing they'll make me wait 2 weeks until my normal monthly appointment to get me on the sublocade shot. Although, maybe I'll be lucky and they'll offer to start it now since I am completely stable on my suboxone as it is.

Will keep everyone updated and let you know my experience with it! May be able to start tomorrow, but I'm guessing I'll be starting around Nov 12th give or take.",1540311168.0

I wasn't worried because the only thing I take are perks and i have a script for them and i hadn't even taken them recently. So I get a call this morning with the people saying that I test positive for H. I told them that its not possible for that and the doctor on the phone even said that the amount in my system wasn't indicative of a user, it was way lower and barely even popped the test. Apparently the cut off is 10 parts per billion and I was at 18 and a user would be in the hundreds or something like that according to him. He even said that it seemed weird and asked me if there was a chance that i was exposed to it because it was such a low amount that I could have been accidentally exposed to it somehow. The thing is i don't know how that is possible. I was at the bar the night before and was also at my friends house who i know actually uses but he didn't even do any while i was there and that was 12 hours before my test even happened. I'm trying to figure out how this could even happen. Does anyone have any ideas? Could I have been exposed to smoke somewhere or somehow my friends house 'contaminated' me? The only other thing i can think of that the house that I live at is a place i found on craigslist and i share it with 7 other people(each person has their own room) and my room has the main ac output vent. Is it possible that someone else in the house using drugs could make it get into my system? My computer is right under the vent and that's where i spend all of my time. Has anyone ever heard of something like this happening?

They've already fired me and they said i can pay to have the sample retested but they wont let me retake it. I want to see if there is any way I could fight this legally and get my job back because i know that I didn't use H and I don't want to lose my job over this shit. I want to see if there is anyway i could make them let me retake so i could show that maybe it was accidentally exposure or something like that and that my levels would be 0(but i guess that wouldn't matter if its in there air where i live but i dont even think that is possible is it?).",1540271995.0

Today I was in my colleges health clinic trying to get my usual twice-a-year codeine-prometh script for my bad cough. I should also mention that I was getting scripted subs from June to last month. So, the dr. comes in, I give my spiel and explain that this is what always works for my coughs (constantly getting sick in this foggy fucking town lol) and etc. I guess the doctor did some type of database search and she was able to see the old sub script. She proceeded to tell me that the clinic itself was trying to not prescribe narcotics (they literally script a pint a month to my homies tho), and that I should “just deal with it” (verbatim lol). Anyway, my question is, for how long can a doctor see all of your narcotic/non narcotic scripts, and is this coming from a dea program or my insurance or what?

So: I am generally in very poor health, and I also often partake in heroin. There's a good chance that I might die relatively soon for reasons unrelated to my heroin use. My biggest fear is that one of my friends or dealers might get in trouble if I die because they'll mistake something for a heroin overdose and go through my phone and see my messages. Even if it was a heroin overdose I don't want my dealer to get in trouble. IMO drug dealers shouldn't suffer the consequences of users using their drugs, unless they're doing something really shitty like cutting it with fentanyl (in which case I still don't if it was \*him\* who cut it or if it was someone higher up in the chain.)

\*\*If I die, how do I make sure no one gets in trouble?\*\* Right now, as silly as it sounds, I leave a note on my fridge saying that don't feel right and I'm having heart palpitations - in case I drop before I can call 911.

I said I’ll go with him and take care of him. So we get in my car to drive no joke maybe 3 blocks. He texts someone and within like maybe a minute some guy named Micha comes out, gets in my car, and I drive him around the block, and he gave me at the very least .7 for my 50 bucks. He gets out, I drive back to where I met this guy to drop him off. I gave him probably 2 bags worth, and then that was it. Easy peasey.

He was injecting everyday for eight years and, at the height of his addiction, he says he shot up eight times a day. I was raped several times a year ago so we haven't actually had sex (I wasn't ready). I want to change this and so does he but every-time we have a serious conversation about it he keeps saying that heroin has fucked up his body and he doesn't want to disappoint me, and how he hasn't had sex in years etc. When I try to ask him what he's actually worried about he just says he's not the same and gets really upset. It devolves pretty quickly and he says that I am not very reassuring. 

I want to understand what the fuck he's worried about because I just don't have enough knowledge on the subject to understand. I tried googling it too but a lot of the sources I find are pretty vague and related to general drug use.

So, objectively - which is better - taking it every day in low doses or taking a high dose every so often?

In school my boys used to cop stamps, im assuming thats ECP? 

What does ""legs"" mean? Does it have something to do with how long it last?

Ive been gaining interest more to the point i wanna try this shit. (i know noone should try it and im aware of that. still want to try it though) i prefer to sniff my drugs so i was wondering which is the preferred flavor for that ROA?

I will 100% test what i get if/when i do cop, can you get reliable test strips from any stores? Or should i order from an online store? 

How do i go about getting Narcan? im getting a new job and my insurance ends next week, and wont kick back in for 6 months.

Last and least important question, whats your guys favorite slang term for dope and your favorite term for your ROA?

Thank you to anyone who reads this",1540229168.0

Recently I have also taken up another addiction being xanax. In about  1 weeks time everything went from being a functional addict to homeless and broke. Someone else totaled my car, got kicked out of my apartment and just ditched my job, shattered the fuck out ny phone and had to leave my cat (which probably  sounds so stupid but I loved that cat) and my mom just found out I relapsed recently after celebrating ""a year clean"" and I swore to her I wouldn't disappoint her like my dad did (who's dead now) which hurts me the most of anything bc I love my mom she's like my best friend. it's been about a week and my money is dwindling and fast. My car is sitting in my apartment parking lot just got notice that if it's not moved it will be towed and I will be fined. The day before my car got totaled I dropped 200$ on a new battery which is destroyed now. This is the lowest I've been since I started my habit. I've definitely felt like I've hit rock bottom before but I've now realized it most certainly gets worse. I had a good job binged through thousands of dollars worth so quick, I always thought heroin was bad but xanax is what is really destroying me and fast. I've never wanted to be clean more than I have right now but at the same time I've never wanted to use more, I've officially lost everything. Right now my urges to use are the highest and my tolerance is fucked and I have nothing. Absolutely fucking nothing. Idk if this even makes sense or if anyone will even read this book of a shit show but I just needed to get that out.  

Edit: as if things couldn't get worse literally less than a half hour of this post I get a message saying all my stuff needs to be removed from my old place by the end of the week when j have no where to put fucking anything. Fuck",1540228070.0

Suddenly realized it may be coming from the gunpowder heroin solution as it cools?!? It’s been all over my body and bloodstream for months,"Gross album with caption descriptions: https://imgur.com/a/JmlQ5N2

If you search my post history you can see more details on the actual severity of the sores/infections that have been popping up throughout my body. I blamed it almost all on the coke until today I noticed for the first time that gunpowder heroin seems to form these grains as it cools. So if I cook up a shot, I’ll generally see a few on the cotton after filtering. Even if I spray the filtered solution back out, optionally spray a little cool water, and then refilter with a fresh cotton, the same happens. I’m freaking out because my habit has been monstrous and recently I’ve been being freaked out more and more by these grainy specks that were appearing on missed shot sores and even in my bloodstream (to test my suspicion, after finishing a shot, I drew back out and found the blood to have a lot of tiny grains (smaller than in the imgur links though). I’m at least 90% sure they’re the same thing. The thing is, Ive been using the same consistent dope the whole time. I got another source recently, and when I realized this yesterday I found both batches had the same property. They’re both super high quality wholesale gunpowder (before it turns to tar) that my dealer and friends/other customers have used for ages, although my habit has been by far the worst. I dont think there’s anything particularly unusual about the dope since its been touched much less than most batches and everyone I know who’s tried it loves it. So wtf is up?? Anyone else who has gunpowder— does yours do this? I really fucking hope my body can filter this out if I take a break now but it’s been so long before I put 2 and 2 together. I hope I’m crazy and this is just something else.  It seems obvious but then why is this not a more common issue? Is it just the fact I can go thru a few grams a day, leading it to build up faster than my body can filter it? Omfg

He's always been good, sometimes I have to wait like a half hour but I don't consider that bad, and he always seems fairly straight up about it (and if it's gonna be a while he just tells me to wait to later.

one time while waiting for him I get a knock at my window ""yo what you want"" and I said nothing right now thanks, and the guy says take my number. So, some days later I can't get my regular guy and I figure fuck it. the stuff I got was -really good-, and a little cheaper. so next time I need I call this new guy again. Then I bounced back to the first guy. \*\*(I want to edit in that this has happened before and never ended badly, in case people who aren't located near any of the dope capitals find this ultra suspect)

So this weekend that just ended, I was going to -a vacation spot that's about 2 hours from here, intending to get high in a free room and rent some movies while my mom gambles with the money they comp her. So I poke around and this newer guys says buns for cheap (idk if I can drop exact prices here btu basically he was giving a better deal per bun than I'd get even buying bulk from the other dude). So, I bit.

Now, I know we've all heard the phrase to good to be true so you'd think I could stop there but it's not that simple. this wasn't weak shit, or light bags ... this was something I'd never encountered. Full disclosure, my habit lately is where if I buy 5 buns, that first bun is going up my nose all at once and usually before I get home. but since 1) these were actually very heavy bags 2) I was still new to this guy and 3) I hadn't used in a few days, I decide to dump out 4. But of HUUUGE note, after less than a quarter of that line I stopped. it hurt my nose a bit, I had to drive, and I just figured what's the rush.

This is when things get weird. That pick up happened at about 9:30. I start driving home. The literal next thing I know, I'm at my desk, I've made a mess of it with ice cream, there's an empty bag of sour patch kids that I vaguely remember buying and eating, but also an empty bag of welch's fruit snacks which I do love but I don't remember eating. what's more, I go downstairs and there are 2 7-11 burgers (again, something I like but don't remember buying or cooking) in the microwave and they've say so long they're inedible (and yes har har they aren't really edible to begin with).

My mom gets me for our 2 1/2 hour ride and I can barely talk. my words are slurring... I've been using for 5 years. my parents know in as much as there's been times where I'm nodding and I have been to rehab, so it's not some huge secret , but I've never been so blatantly fucked up that they searched my pockets and that's exactly what happened here.

I'm not going back to rehab, I didn't get kicked out, there's many many worse ways this could have gone... but what I AM is here to say, if you see a stamp that says gunsmoke written in red, please stay away. I know I can't say where I got it but even as mostly a lurker here I'd feel wrong to not share. I've been high as shit before, I really love heroin what can I say... but I don't think this was even close to heroin.

The closest I can describe the feeling is taking a bunch of xanax. I couldn't keep my eyes open, slurring words, and I lost memory of a day and a half. further, this was all friday right? I lost a bun somewhere, or I did it, I truly don't know. friday night ends with me hold 2 buns and 7 bags with the intention of maybe doing 1 bag the next day to see what happens, or trying to barter somewhere to get something out of it if my conscience would let me. Instead I woke up the next day thinking my parents flushed it, so I asked them. not even mad just did you flush it? and they said no, we woke up to a ton of empty bagsin the bathroom, although they didn't count them to see if it was all 27. I have zero recollection of this and zero reason to think they'd lie if they just flushed the stuff as I'd made clear this was some stuff that was worse than bunk, it scared the shit out of me.

Anyway I guess this is sort of a PSA but also asking for advice. when I finally called the guy I got it from he said it ""must have been too strong for me"" ???? I'm not trying to brag about tolerance, I don't shoot up and I am not wealthy enough for the heavy regular use I'd probably be doing if I had more money. but even still, overdoing it has only ever led to severe vomiting and headaches in my world, not extreme word slurring and absolutely not memory loss (besides if you consider nodding memory loss in some convoluted way, but I was forgetting entire conversation, journeys (not with me driving)

I flew home to the Midwest for winter break, and while staying at my folks place noticed my dad had installed a safe in the closet of the room I was staying in. Being a reckless hoodlum and oh so young at the time, I snuck up into his room got his keyring out of his pants and low and behold the safe key was attached..

Upon opening the safe, I was greeted by two large plastic Tupperware containers with all kinds of old Rx meds...Vicodin, Percocet, lorazepam to name a few....and inside as well was a CURIOUS small glass vial labeled for my then deceased grandpa. It was a Rx from the early 90s with a small piece of paper slipped inside identifying it as Meperidine 50mg. Some research discovered this was an old Rx for Demerol, which is rarely used anymore but used to be used in hospitals during and post surgery and sometimes prescribed for acute pain afterwards. There were 12 of them. Greatest opiate I have ever done, even through my 5+ years of heroin use both ECP and BTH...

I tried hanging myself last night, I’ve done this previously but in reality i don’t think they were very serious attempts. As normally I’d be under the influence of a decent amount of xanax. Last night though, last night was different. I knew exactly what I was doing and was very serious too. Ultimately though I was unsuccessful.

Here are my thoughts.,"Long story short. Used opiates from age 14 until I was 22 (currently 23). I graduated from University and decided to move half way across the US and start clean. The plan has worked very well so far. I am completely sober, even from alcohol and all other vices. I work a job in the insurance field on the West Coast and life is pretty laid back.  


With that being said, being sober has been a drag. Life is really boring nowadays. I can't seem to find the excitement in life anymore. I wake up, work, eat dinner, watch some basketball/football, go to bed. Even if I get invited out with friends or co-workers, it all seems so bleak. I associate night life with partying. Bars, clubs, house parties... hell, even tailgating lol.

I don't have the desire to go socialize in a non-work environment if I can't rip lines of roxi, drink a cup of codeine, and pop some vicodin. 

&#x200B;

My hobbies are also really boring too... I don't find any joy when playing video games and I have no desire to work out (on opiates I would work out all the time.. I know.. that is weird as hell)

&#x200B;

For those who are sober.... Does life ever return to a normal? Or will everything be anti-climatic for the rest of my life due to how awesome drugs are?",1540176918.0

I basically logged in to show him I was ice. We got along great. Crackin jokes and cutting up..

The puppy was an American bulldog about 8 weeks old and very cute.  I didn't know this,, but bulldogs have been so genetically engineered that they can't even mate w/o human help. The male's legs are so short that he can't mount the female on his own. That's kinda messed up, but onto my mounting.

I was playing with the puppy and Church Girl went into her bedroom.  From the bedroom, She said to me ""It feels so good to get out of work clothes after a long day"" and she comes out in just bra and panties.  Remember, that we haven't been intimate.

I'm trying to be Joe Cool, but damn any almost- naked woman at her peak of sexual attraction is just wonderful. So I am futilely trying to look without looking.

I was just about to make my move when she says ""I clean and cook and I know how to take care of a man. See what a good wife would be?""  and then she brings up my GF and how I have to leave my GF for her.

I played with the puppy a little more and said I was tired and went home,thinking ""I am such a loser.

&#x200B;

They're one hell of a drug. I can't say I love anything more. As horrible as that sounds, its the truth my body has established. But Ive realized, sometimes the things we love aren't the things that benefit us.

&#x200B;

I started using opiates probably about 8 years ago, when I was 15 years old. It started with trying different pills as an experimental teenager. This lead to me finding out that I love the way opiates make me feel by far more than anything else. I found that I was more social with them, less inhibited, more funny/outgoing, and quickly started using them as a social lubricant much like the ""normal"" person would use alcohol. I then realized my grandparents had a stash of 100's of 5mg vicodens and that was game over for me. I would take them periodically through the months and use them in strategic times. What started as a recreational high, quickly turned into something where I was using the opiates to compensate for insecurities/lack of feeling social in the way that I always wanted to.

&#x200B;

This never got too out of control, but then I tried heroin three years ago.

&#x200B;

I would never have imagined myself saying this, nor would wish this statement upon anyone's psyche, but; Heroin is amazing.

&#x200B;

I thought my use was under control, as I was maintaining my grades, kicking ass in the gym, and establishing healthy friendships, all while under the periodic use of heroin for 2 years. I didn't realize however, how much I was setting myself up for dependency, as even though I wasn't a full blow addict, I would purchase and utilize the substance when I felt like I wanted to, and use it. Having a hypothetical sense of self control was stimulated by witnessing friends who tried dope at the same time as me, go down extremely bad paths very fast. So i thought I was a ""born prodigy"" in the managing life while recreationally getting high department.

&#x200B;

This is untrue.

&#x200B;

My relaxed view of dope affecting me as a person with ambitions in life, and inability for loved ones to realize what I was doing, reinforced my stance on use, in some way or another for as long as I can remember experimenting with drugs. About a year ago, I really started diving into the drug game. I was snorting ketamine and going to space, then buying dope here and there still and going to therapeutic lala-land. I could study harder and longer on dope. I could go on runs and beat my record times and have longer stamina on dope. I could out-lift my record PR's in the gym on dope. I could talk to girls the way I wanted to on dope. I was a self proclaimed super hero on dope.

&#x200B;

I started using every day. Never injected, thank god, but smoking in the bathroom strategically at my house, under the noses of all my loved ones, never getting caught.

&#x200B;

I realized I had a problem probably about 6 months ago, when my best friend passed away from fentanyl. I wanted to stop, but realized quickly how hard that was. I stopped for 5 days after his death, then used again, feeling like an utter asshole for doing so, but nonetheless doing it. High at his funeral, I was numb, didn't shed one tear, yet torn apart to little pieces in my body about my best friend dying from substance of the like. I felt ashamed. Yet I felt okay. That double edged paradoxically present feeling is the fine line that I always find myself dancing on before establishing that Im going to use, and urgently finding it and using.

&#x200B;

The negative effects of opiate use has affected more than just my wallet. Ive utterly forgotten that theres other pleasures in life than getting high. I didn't realize I had forgotten about sex, masturbation, and appreciating subtle things in life. I want so much out of life, but feel like I can't achieve a lot of these things without feeling that rockstar feeling that allows me to feel like I can take on the world; that I get from dope. My internal hormones and male feelings of confidence and most likely testosterone levels have depreciated. I haven't had sex in a long time because it just wasn't a priority. I have forgotten how to properly flirt with woman and naturally hook up, etc., because through important developmental years where I otherwise would have encountered/learned how to maneuver those situations, I was always wielded with an opiate of one form or another in my system.

&#x200B;

I'm tired of feeling reliant on something other than myself, to be the person i want myself to be. I'm over feeling lost in life, and like I want to drop out of college, even though during moments of clarity, I know college and scientific motivation has always been of utmost importance to me. Im tired of sacrificing vital opportunity to create meaningful relations with girls and guy friends, because getting high or coming down was more important at the moment.

&#x200B;

I feel like I need a support group, or people to talk to who are in the same situation - but can't seem to find an NA meeting that fits my school schedule.

&#x200B;

I use to deny being an addict, and think that I can do any drug or anything without any repercussions - however, today, without drugs present, I find myself binge eating food, smoking nicotine constantly, or just urging to find dope in some way. All these things said - at the end of the day, I truly don't want to use. I want to get out of this vicious cycle, that has only benefitted me with superficial beliefs that it is actually benefitting me. It has never advanced me in life.

&#x200B;

I transferred schools, and am in a bachelor program now. Have been here for a month, used the first week, and was 3 weeks clean, then drove back home (2.5 hours away) last week to get more dope.. out of literal urgency to get high. I dropped everything, bailed home, and drove back the next morning. As soon as i get the thought in my head that It is feasible to go get dope, its like i can't shake that feeling and i get tunnel vision on getting that dope as my highest priority. its so psychological its unbelievable. I feel so drowsy, and unmotivated in the mornings, without dope, even during the later part of those 3 weeks i was clean.. i don't get it. I have suboxone, but am almost out.. they help with the energy, but they don't last forever.

&#x200B;

How have you guys dealt with this in the past? Can anyone relate to this? I feel trapped. I feel like i want a psychiatrist to prescribe me anxiety meds, and focus meds, so i can curb the feelings that make me want to use dope in the first place... but then I also don't want to get caught in a further circle of drug use... anyone have any insight? What has worked in the past? Do feelings of sexual deficiency come back to a natural state after stopping use? Can you feel happy, and not urged to use after gotten clean?",1540171308.0

I can see the light at the top, filtering down, its getting closer. I don't want to reach it. I don't know why but I'm terrified. And then I hit the surface, I gasp for breath, open my eyes... I'm lying in bed, covered in sweat. It soaks through my sheets. I left my window open last night, and the cold morning air stings my skin. Now I remember why I didn't want to reach the surface. To wake up. To face the day. I slept in, I realize, looking at the clock. I'm already sick. I rip the covers off, nausea rises in my stomach. The eyes water, that sick metallic taste lingers in the back of my mouth.... I should have saved something for the morning... I pick my cell up off the floor. 15 missed calls. All from S. I call him back. 

'Hey man, your still down to go right???'He's trying to hide the panic in his voice. 'Yeah, don't worry' I say, 'I'll be there soon as possible' I stumble to my feet, pull some dirty jeans on, the denim hurts the skin on contact. I pull a shirt on, and its immediately soaked with my sweat. I've been wearing these clothes for 6 days now, haven't showered in just as long. My hair and skin is greasy, my face scattered with zits. I eat half a banana, feel like puking, and throw it into the yard as I walk out the door. When withdrawing my walk takes on that of an old man. 

I hobble out to the car. Its at the end of my driveway. it seems like a mile. I'm glad to just sit and drive, although now the sickness is getting to the next stage. My bones feel bruised, my legs radiate with dull aching from the bone out. I drive like a madman. 20 minutes later i arrive at S's house. I can't get out of the car. I honk. 
He comes hobbling out just like me, quick as he can, and jumps in. He looks at me, eyes wide and frantic, pouring sweat, and screams. 'AAAHHH!!!! FUCK! Lets go, PLEASE, PLEASE!!!' 'Alright! Alright! I'm going!' I back out and tear down the road. S starts laughing. He still has a sense of humor. 'I'm sorry dude! BWWWAAAAH!!!' - his signature sound. 'I'm just so fucking sick... Don't have much cash either its looking pretty grim.' 

'well I'm broke dude, you know that. All I can do is drive' I say. S had been buying bags and kicking me shots for like 2 weeks now, 'cause he has no car and I drive, every so often I get extra cash and can actually get high, instead of just getting 'well'. 
I drive toward Portland. Soon we hit the freeway, and as if on cue S grabs my phone and dials. He uses his very slow, precise speech so the Mexicans can understand. 'Hey buddy, I be there soon where can I meetchu? --- street and --- street, 2 north 1 east?' I automatically start memorizing the location, saying it over and over in my head. 'ok 10-15 minute? ok buddy' S hangs up. 

For the next 10 minutes we don't speak until we get to the spot, we drive to the designated intersection, then go 2 blocks north and 1 block east, like they said, parking in a residential neighborhood. And the waiting game begins. the worst part. 15 minutes go by, they aren't here yet. We call, they say 5 more. 8 minutes later we call again, they say 5 more! We wait another 10 fucking minutes, getting pissed. I pick up the phone about to CRY I'm so fucking sick. As I'm dialing the numbers S yells. 'LOOK! THERE THEY ARE! LOOK! LOOK!' I drop the phone. 

The Mexicans are coming down the block towards us in their old blue car, they smile and wave as they pass us. I flip a U-turn, my tires screeching. Finally, I think, FUCKING FINALLY. We follow them a few blocks, until we get on a block with not many people outside. Theres only one guy outside, mowing his lawn. He doesn't take notice as the Mexicans pull up to the curb, and I do the same. S jumps out and runs up, jumping into their car. I follow them again, 2 blocks down. then they slow, S jumps out, and runs back to my car, jumping in, out of breath. 

'SHIT YEAH! THANK GOD!' He yells. 'Lets go! Lets go to somewhere with a bathroom dude, quick!' I hate doing this, but we can't wait to get all the way home, we're too sick now. But the sickness seems to subside just a little knowing that I'll be well soon. I grin uncontrollably, but I'm filled with sadness at the same time. If my girlfriend and my family could see me now... God. S has 5 different colored water balloons sitting in his lap. Its a chunk of tar, wrapped in plastic, then a water balloon, for $10-$15 each. He told me he didn't have much money, I think to myself. 

He opens 2 balloons and starts breathing onto the powder to make it turn to tar. Soon he has 2 pea sized chunks of gooey, black, vinegar smelling tar wrapped in plastic. He hands one to me. He's generous today. 'Thanks for driving, man' he says. 'No, thank you' I say, 'I don't know what I'd do without you.' I pull into the parking lot of a big store and park. S hands me a clean rig, we fill them up from a bottle of water off the floor of the car. Then we get out, I don't even lock the car I'm so anxious, and we both power speed walk towards the store. By now my entire body aches, my skin stings, my stomach is turning over, my bones feel like their on fire. I would be crying in agony if it weren't for the fact that I know I'll be high in 3 minutes. S and I get inside the store, acting like we don't even know each other, and head for the bathrooms. 

We each go into a separate stall. I pull an old spoon out of my pocket, and place 3/4 of my balloon inside. Then I squirt the water from the syringe into the spoon, and begin cooking it. my hands are shaking, I nearly spill some. Soon the tar, black as night, melts down into the water, turning to a brown puddle. The bitter, vinegar like smell fills the bathroom stall. I worry about people outside the stall smelling it, but theres just one old man at the urinal out there. I tear a small peice of cotton off of a cotton ball I had in my pocket, and toss it into the brown sludge. I watch the cotton soak up the liquid, until its consumed, sitting in a small puddle. I stick the end of the needle into the cotton, and draw back,sucking the entire contents into the syringe. A dark brown mixture, filling 1/3 of the 1 cc syringe. I cap it, and take off my belt, wrapping it tight around my left arm. 

This is the part I hate, I don't understand people who enjoy this. I slap my arm a few times, and a large vein reveals itself at the crook of my elbow. I pull the cap off the rig with my teeth, and slowly begin sliding it into the vein. I hear S grunt a few stalls down, and mumble 'mother fucker, fuckin thing'. My right hand, holding the spike is shaking, it takes me two tries, till I feel that 'pop' of the needle entering the vein. I draw back the plunger, it fills with a crimson mushroom cloud, the deep red overtaking the brown mixture. My stomach turns over, my heart pounds in my chest, this is gonna be a big one. I loosen the belt around my arm and push down the plunger, slowly, careful not to let the needle pop out, missing shots is horrible. Then, its done. I pull the needle out, cap it, place it in my pocket. 

I put my belt back on. But the whole time I'm counting, subconsciously, 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, and then WHOOOSH, I feel the warmth, emanating outward from my chest and deep in my head, I feel a tingle deep inside my being, like being on the verge of an orgasm. My eyes close, all on their own, my body seems to sink into the opiate. The warmth takes over, eradicating the sickness, and I'm glowing. I feel ten feet off the ground... my god, its almost too good. I wobble on my feet, my eyes closed, having trouble keeping balanced. Suddenly I hear my name. Where am I? I open my eyes, oh yeah its S calling my name, but I don't care, I'm in a blur, a beautiful merciful blur. I feel like I'm in a warm bath. For a second, I almost forget the hassle of the day, and that I'll have to do it all over again tomorrow. I step out of the stall and see S waiting for me, a slight smile on his face. 'Man,' I say, ' I don't wanna do this anymore, I wanna get clean.' S is nodding out, standing there. He shakes his head around trying to come out of it. 'Huh? Oh yeah.

I felt good after throwing up each time but I would swig some beer after and immediately throw up again and I was on my first beer of the day.

I know fent is way stronger but I still did 1/4 of the pill which should equate to about 20mg, but I’ve been prescribed 60mg oxy everyday for years with zero issues... if fent is still an opiate then why does it feel so different than Oxy? Do other users here feel that Pure H feels better than stuff cut with fent? I’ve tried pure H that I tested and had zero fent in it but I don’t wanna go deep down that road.

But on friday, i went to my therapy session at around 20 past 11 in the morning, after taking my sub at 11 sharp. I know this sounds late but i normally pick it up around that time, or even later (12-1) sometimes. I did cycle there really fast but as soon as i got there i felt really sick and had to go to the toilet, sat down to shit and started vomiting as well and sweating all over. I basically went into full withdrawals, right in the fucking toilets at the therapy place... fml. Anyway the sub started to work slowly after about half an hour and i got a lift home, and jumped into the shower. I felt fine for a bit, then vomited again but pulled around after smoking a little spliff. I actually didnt sniff any bupe that day til about 7pm.     
   
Yesterday, i woke up and felt a bit ill again, anyway went for a shit again and knew it was coming. So i shoved my sub under my tongue and waited in the shower for it to kick in but it didnt save me quickly. Still ended up vomiting for about 30 mins to an hour. Pretty much straight. There was a lot of yellow bile and a bit of blood (thought the blood was just down to all the retching though).    
   
Today, i woke up and went into withdrawals really quickly. Didnt have time to have a shit, just started the retching as soon as i got to the bathroom. It took me a fucking long time to stop vomiting for long enough to let my sub dissolve. I managed to kinda do it eventually, just stuck it under my tongue and went in the shower again. But the bit that concerns me is, it seemed like there was a lot of blood today. I dont know whether it is blood - but i was puking some really dark brown/red stuff, looked like blood mixed with bile maybe. But there was so much fucking red in it, i didnt get a really good look cos i was starting to get faint but im fucking sure that is not meant to come out your body.    
   
Tldr; Im really just asking whether anyone has any experience of sniffing bupe causing withdrawal to onset quicker, or whether people think this might be something different.   
Thanks for any help people. And I’m thinking of calling the local on call doctors this afternoon, wanted to post here too. Ive just smoked a spliff and im heading to the spa to fucking chill out for a bit now i finally feel human.    
   
Also worth mentioning that this seems to get randomly worse through the day, like I’ll get a bit sicker again midday and have to sit down. Ive partly remedied that today with a bump of sub and that spliff but i still dont feel right, which makes me think it might be something else. Sorry for the huge ranting post, I just wanna know wtf could be going on!

He tells me to come around to the backside of his apartment complex, and I will see him in his window.

This confuses me because his window is on the second floor and there is no access to it. (no stairs etc)

So I'm standing there, freezing my ass off, in this dimly lit parking lot in the bad side of town, with my car parked around the front, blankly staring at his window directly up from me.

I text him ""yo dude I dont really know what to do from here...""
Suddenly the window opens up and a little coin purse comes slowly but surely dangling down on a fishing line. Mind you this is in a really burnt side of town and to anyone wirnessing this, it must of been the greatest thing ever. I look up at the window where I see him, in all his glory, holding a fucking fishing pole out the window, waving at me with his free hand. 

Trying not to laugh I open the purse and place my money in. I give him a thumbs up, and he reels in my cash like he's pulling in a 20 pound Salmon. 
It reaches him, he pulls it in and then moments later it comes dangling back down, with ny dope inside. I grab it, give him the thumbs up again, and walk back to my car.

Got in the car and I laughed about what the fuck jist happened all the way down the block. This life brings absolutely everything. Never know what you might see. ",1540104614.0

She’s wanting birthday sex, a night night together & my sex drive and excitement is pretty low. Maybe I’m a psychopath feeling apathetic idk..

I planned on going to bed & getting us up at 7am tomorrow and I’m not a person for all nighters anymore. I wish I had opiates for this situation..

My only option to show that I actually care and make her feel good right now is by taking a 2nd dose of Suboxone along with a higher dose of Valium than I normally take & a higher dose of Adderall (which I don’t do at all when it comes to Adderall).

TL;DR: I need quick advice while my wife is grabbing weed on her birthday. It’s about 1am, she expects nice night, the only way I can make this night better for her is if I abuse my Adderall, Valium and Suboxone to stay up and playful with her..

I have thought of things that could land me in a mental institution. I feel shame, regret, and anxiety every hour of every day. Many of those on here who have interacted with me before are probably saying ""that fucking guy deserves every bit of guilt he is feeling and worse"". What can I say, I don't blame you for thinking that way. I apologize, I do. My brain makes it impossible for me to let things go, to think positively, and to block out the grotesque images that flash through my mind.

&#x200B;

I abused a variety of drugs for a long time to escape the prison that is my mind. Stimulants, depressants, psychedelics, dissociatives, you name it. I thought it helped with my depression, anxiety, and ADHD but now that I've been clean from just about everything (I've had a few drinks, use my e-cigarette, and I have taken my prescribed adderall) for 4 weeks, I realize that all they did was help me bottle everything up.

I realize that I fucking hate myself and how terrible of a person I have been, and I realize now how hard it must be for my friends and family to deal with a negative, lazy, weird, disgusting fuck up like me.

I am so sorry. I feel crazy and alone. I thought that life would be easier once I got clean and got past withdrawals. I feel more mentally fucked up and anxious than I've ever felt before, which is stupid because everything is going well for me. I now have a great job, I'm moving out of my shitty house, I'm clean from all illegal substances, but my fucking brain won't let me be happy and it won't let me block these terrible images from my head.

Please read this and offer up some advice if you can.","My life honestly depends on how I play my cards tonight. My fiance, child, and I live with my brother and his husband, and my mother. I have struggled with sobriety for years now. About 3.5/4 months ago my brother got a new job in California, and we all moved here. Up until the day I got on the plane to come here, I was kicked out of the house and separated from my daughter (who just turned 2 at the beginning of the month) and fiance, because I had relapsed. I was homeless and living on friend's couches for 4 months, after I had slipped up and had been using for about a year when my fiance finally told her therapist, who called CPS, and my fiance told my brother. 

Now, my brother is the most emotionally, mentally, morally, and personally abusive narcissist you will ever find. I'm a grown man, and I chose to do the dope. I fully acknowledge that. But you guys have now clue how hard it is to say sober when you have someone keeping you up until sunrise yelling at you about how big of a piece of shit you are, or telling you everything you do is wrong, from smoking weed in a recreational state, to the way you wear your hair, to going on a walk at night, to the way you raise your child, everything. And then goes to your fiance and make her choose between agreeing with him or having him unleash on her, too. Then makes gigantic deals over the smallest things. Literally, living with him almost makes sobriety impossible.

So recently, I fucked up and met a dealer. I've used for about two weeks now. Last night/today my fiance found a few QTips, each with one end missing its cotton, and found a piece of toilet paper with black soot from the bottom of my spoon, that was sitting in the toilet because somehow it hung onto the bowl and didn't flush. Now they are all losing their minds. I ended up getting the day off work today, but they all think I'm there now. I need to figure out a way to pass a home drug test, and I need to explain away the QTips. If I don't, I will be homeless and never see my daughter again. I even decided last night to switch back to my subs because it wasn't worth it a vowed to find a healthier way to deal with my stress. And then this happens.

I understand that I shouldn't have done it, and I totally get that I fucked up and no one else did it for me. Please, I don't need lectures right now. I have to have urine that will test positive for weed and not dope. I have a bottle of Quick Fix. And as far as explaining the QTips, I got nothing. Maybe I can say that's one of the muscle habits that stuck with me from being a junkie and that when I'm stressed I pull off the ends and roll them into little balls? Idk. Please, someone help me.

From my experience in rehab and NA, most people agree that you need to abstain from ALL drugs if you want to remain sober from the ones you wish. 
They say that relapse always starts with small usage like smoking weed and drinking alcohol. 

As a recovering opiate and benzo addict, I have so far found this to be true in my past few relapses. How many of you have been able to remain sober from the harder drugs that ruined your life but are still able to dabble in smaller shit like smoking weed and consuming alcohol? It may be a stupid question but I’m curious as to how many people actually are able to successfully do this. It may be silly but I still enjoy these activities and don’t want to have to give them up if it’s not absolutely necessary.

It's almost like i need my curiosity for opiates filled in everyday with new shit.

I've been fascinated with poppies, needles and foils since i was young. My country had the worst heroin epidemic in europe in the 90's so i've seen a lot. IRL i've befriended some randos just to see them smoke or inject and listen to their stories and provide some comfort if i can. I used to carry around new needles (stolen from my mum, a nurse) to pass around because some users had this camaraderie thing around here and they all shared the same shit and it was nasty, with most of them getting hepatites over time).

Overall i find the rituals (and individuals) extremely interesting, although i always said ""no"" to heroin even on my darkest hours, because some of them really tempted me. Others were extremely protective of me and said that, around them, i would never smoke/snort/inject or they would beat me sensless lol.

At some level, i think i need to see opiates around. I need to know that they're here helping people. I also need to constantly made aware of the dangers so i don't go through that path.

So if youve seen some my posts, I relapsed a few weeks ago and have been waiting on my dealer to get subs to finally detox. Well today was sub saturday so I hit my dealer up for a quarter gram(just for a last hurrah) and 4 8 mg subs. He gets in my car and first thing I notice is the bag looks bigger than a quarter g, so I hand him the money and he says, ""it should be 80"" and I told him I only ordered a quarter g and he says he swore I said a half g. So I pull up my phone and sure enough I was right. So I give him the bag for him to split it up, he splits the bag the drops half of the tar in no man's land in my car. He just says fuck it and dips. I get home, search my car for 10 minutes and sure enough find the quarter g piece. 

Wooooooo! feels nice, especially since this is my last pick up before I go on subs so it's definitely made my day. I mean, it's just an extra quarter gram  but free dope is free dope! So i got a half gram for the price of a quarter gram :)",1540076235.0

My boyfriend got it from one of his coworkers a couple weeks ago and took it out of its original package and folded it up in a business card. Since I have such a high metabolism I started having withdrawals (aches/pains, anxiety, yawning, excessive tearing up in my eyes, etc.) after only eight hours of not using h so I took the sub at 8:30 this morning.    I cut it up into three pieces and took it in thirty minute intervals. 

At first I felt a little better, but wasn't feeling the relief I expected. I tried to go to work but was sent home because I could barely stand up. I was craving h so bad. So since I didn't have to work I decided to help one of my dealers out and take her to do some drops in exchange for gas money and h. As the day was going on I was feeling only a little better and better, until my dealer let me smoke some h with her and I instantly felt relief from the physical withdrawals. Since being home I've felt pretty great, I've smoked a little tiny more h but I only felt physical relief and wasn't getting high. I'm not really craving h right now I just feel kinda normal. 

I feel like the sub I took had lost most of its potency from being out of its package for so long or maybe I took it wrong by cutting it up? Because I only felt serious relief after smoking a little h. My boyfriend expected me to take this sub and be able to get through heroin withdrawals for the next few days then stay clean for a couple weeks and save money. I just don't think that this one little sub is going to do the trick, especially if I needed some h to completely get rid of withdrawals. ",1540073086.0

anyway i was in jail for about a month and then my girl bonded me out. i met a new plug in jail but ill get to him in a bit. she had to go to work when she bonded me out and obviously i just wanted to get high so i called my old plug. he knows i went to jail and has him meet me at his buddys house in the hood and strip searches me. doesnt find anything and lets me get my bag and go. a day or so later i deleted his number bc im sick and tired of being a junkie and going to jail and doing nothing with my life. plus i never really liked him. a lot of my dealers over the years ive become friends with, but this dude is just a straight asshole. i even heard him say ""i dont care if all yall motherfuckers OD and die. which is dumb bc there goes his income. so ive been out of jail for about a month doing pretty well, ive slipped up a couple times but im not too worried about it. i just cant get to the point where i NEED it everyday ever again. i dont want to be a slave to any substance. 

so i get off work yesterday and come home to relax. my girl and my sister go to the grocery store and i stay home with my 8 year old niece. im sorta half asleep bc i work for a landscape management company and my job is tough. all of the sudden my niece comes in and says ""theres a black man at the door for you"" i thought it might be my new plug i met in jail bc i owed him some money. but it wasnt, it was my old plug. keep in mind ive only seen him once since i got out of jail and the whole strip search thing rubbed me the wrong way. so hes standing there in my door way with his 9 tucked in his waist like always. and he starts up with this story. ""so the feds kicked in my door , yeah they didnt find shit though just bags and scales. then he looks at me and asks me if i rolled on him in jail. its cold outside and i dont have a shirt on and im also terrified of getting shot so im shaking pretty badly. i explain to him that im not on probation or anything, and yes this is a felony but in my state they are going to offer me prob 3-5 years of probation. im not a huge fan of probation but im not gonna roll on someone to the feds to save my own ass. if i got jail time or whatever i would just take it like a man. and then he starts asking me about my buddy who was in the car with me and also got arrested. he got arrested for VOP and also they charged him and me with the bag they found in the car. his story is a lot different. hes on first offender probation for some bad charges, and considering he VOP'd with a new felony, he is more than likely going up the road for a few years (to prison). and then my old dealer tells me that he has boys in jail who told him that the other kid asked to talk to investigators. which means hes probably rolling on me, the plug, anyone he can to save his ass. he finally starts to believe me and then gives me his new number, which i dont even want but it would look suspect to say no. 

and then my new plug shows up this morning to collect the money i owe him and he notices something is wrong with me so he asks if im ok. and i told him what happened. he said fuck that i would have called the police if that nigga brought that street shit to my house where my family stays and threatened me like that. this new plug is such a good dude im so glad i met him. he just gives me about a half g today of ECP but its rocked up, for free just bc he felt bad for me and knew i didnt have any money after paying him back. and tells me not to worry about paying him for it. ive only known him a month but hes already made at least 2 grand off me. i middle man for a lot of people that only like picking up from me. i know its all about money and shit for him but i think ill end up being friends with this guy too.

the one time i asked my old plug for a point on the front he charged me $55 for it. (i usually pay $20 up front) hes just all around a piece of shit and i cant believe he showed up to my house threatening me. and im a convicted felon so i dont even have any guns in the house. anyway sorry for the rant i just had to tell someone.",1540065006.0

So I recently quit all drugs to improve our chances of having a child. Which worked, I got my girl pregnant and everything was going just fine. 10 weeks in everything was perfect, I was proud of myself for staying sober for as long as I have (about 4.5 months now) and extremely excited to start this chapter in our lives. Than everything went to shit. My girlfriend started bleeding, so we went to the doctor and had tests done and it turned out we lost the baby. Nothing we could have done to prevent it, it's just something that happens sometimes. I had to keep an eye on my girlfriend to make sure she didn't start getting flu like symptoms or anything like that because there could be an issue with the body expelling the fetus. Gross I know but that's what happens. She seemed okay, until I get 12 missed calls when I finish writing an exam at school. So I call back and her mom answers the phone and tells me she is having emergency surgery to possibly remove on of her tubes because she could have ectopic pregnancy which can be extremely dangerous. 

Of course I immediately leave school, sit in the waiting room in the hospital for over 12 hours until 4 in the morning. (meanwhile I have a major exam at 8am) turns out they didn't have to remove the tube, but she had to have a D&C procedure. I decided to not go my my exam that day so I could be there for her because this is obviously hard for both of us but mainly her.  I did email my teachers but unfortunately there is no re writes for exams. She had to stay in the hospital for 2 days, and I didn't leave her side until I was able to bring her home. 

We get home and I get her settled and she is on lots of pain pills and stuff for the pain for the surgery. Since I'm sober now I didn't even think about taking her pain pills because she obviously needs them for her pain because she can barely walk or do anything for herself.  Before I got sober the piece of shit I was I probably would have taken some of her Dilaudid and shot it for sure. Not this time. 

In the midst of all of this I missed 3 crucial exams, and am now failing my courses when I previously was above 90% in all of my classes. Everything is just falling apart and all I can think of now is getting some pills or heroin and getting high, high as fuck and forgetting all of this. Forgetting that I just wasted over 10g on my course at my school since I don't think I can recover from this since my exams are worth 20-25% of my final mark, forgetting we just lost the baby we tried for 2.5 years to have. Everything. 

I got some kratom, I'm going to use that and hopefully push the cravings away from getting high but any word of encouragement would be great in this dark time of my life right now. Has anyone gone through something similar to this and any advice anyone can give me? I just feel hopeless. ",1540064702.0

It seems to me that highly intelligent people have a natural preference to the best drug out there, aka opium. No idea why anyone would be into anything else, but oh well. Anyways. Are there any people with a high-skilled job? All shows always show addict characters as cool, sophisticated high-achieving people with money, doctors lawyers nurses etc. 
I’m a software engineer myself. 
Well truth is that I am not an active addict not have I ever been, but I have a super addictive obsessive personality, so if I had permanent access, oh boy. Luckily though it would have to be access to a script/Pharma drugs because the OCD part of my brain would only let me do drugs that are 100% clean. Even when I was able to buy a couple of pills I took 2 hours researching and looking at pics online making sure they look exactly how they should. Just paranoid of any chemical out there on the streets. Anyways. I don’t have any dealers that sell pharmaceuticals (or any dealers at all for that matter) so I never became actively addicted - which is great because even with a good job those pills sell for a crazy amount of money. I did a few calculations for fun, and I’m pretty sure even those fictitious well-paid characters would run out of money feeding their daily habit. A top corporate lawyer in NYC would make 500k annually, but I think you’d still need a few millions in the bank rolling and in investments to keep income super high regularly, but with just a salary of 500k coming via regular paychecks - you’d not make enough.

No tiny shot, no rinses, nothing. I had some suboxones but my last shot was only twelve hours ago and I'm not trying to deal with that right now.

I was getting money at 11:30am; it was 9:00am when I woke up. Two and a half awful hours between waking up and getting well. I had talked to my Main last night and explained the situation. He fronts me often and I currently owe him 140$(due on Monday) but he still sells me sacks until then. He told me last night to hit him up when I get up and if hes awake before I get the money he'll help me out before.

So 10:00am rolls around and I've sent him two texts, he responded with a simple ""Sure, Ross parking lot in 20mins"". And sure enough I was there in 19mins and he was waiting for me. I pull up next to his black Toyota and we exchange a pack of cigs; the sack enclosed inside.

He cracks a fat grin which I've legit never seen him smile in the two and a half months of our buisness relationship and says ""I threw in some extra for you"", and the sack was legit twice the size it should be. Instead of .3 for 40$ which is normal he hooked me up with .65-.7 for 40$ and I didnt even have the money on hand to pay him this morning and he still hooked it up fatter than hell.

This dude is awesome, I snatched him up by my middle man calling him on my phone one day. My phone low key saves all the data outside the call log so even though my middle cleared my call log the number was still saved. I sent him a text explaining who I was. What I wanted. And why i would be worth his time. (I spend roughly 400$ a week on dope, not anymore but used to). It's been awesome since then.

It wasn’t PWD because things didn’t get worse. And even if it was, I didn’t get relief the next 3 days. Last year I kicked for a little over a month with a rapid sub taper and it was relatively easy.

So had a little job to do today just tidying up a garden leaf litter etc and tidying up a green house by getting rid of the old tomato plants and the bags of soil. A quick £30 😀 
So picked ap a few bags and headed home on the way there I get a message from a friend asking me to come to his bit so since I had a few bags I thought why the hell not! He's done me solid in the past so I'll return the faviour. Get to his bit which is only a 5/10 minute walk away from mine and give him half a bag. Though he kinda struggles to get himself and the tool fills up with blood which I hate as I always think/feel as if you don't get the same rush if you had got yourself straight away. I didn't stay long and after about half an hour I went down the road to my house and prepped up my final bag of the night (pic) 
   After this I think I'm going too complete Spider-Man as I've done most of the side missions except the Task master ones I've battled him for the first time but that's as far as I've got with him. I'm just going to go to the final mission and get it done and battle Doc Ock I presume. 
   Hope everyone is good and no one is in WD that isn't trying to get of the opiate of there choice. Or worse you have money but can't score or your in limbo waiting for your guy to show up on the dreaded ""Dealer Time!!!""

I was eventually put on 20mg Oxymorphone 3x day and Hydromorphone 8mg 4x day. Great pain relief, great sleep and nods.
Then around the beginning of the last year, I start having major tolerance issues - 60mg Oxymorphone and 32-64 Hydromorphone wasn't even giving me as much as a feeling in my chest.
  
Then this year I asked my Dr to switch my ER from Oxymorphone to Fentanyl for insurance reasons. As per usual Dr starts Fent dose at 25mcg and over the course of 3 months, my dose is titrated until I reached 100mcg. I still have my 8mg Hydromorphone too but they I receive no relief for pain. 
  
I've done semi tolerance breaks for weeks at a time, keeping half a fent patch on and no hydromorphone. Sometimes after a week my tolerance feels fixed other times it does nothing.
  
Id also likes to point out that my ROA for Hydromorphone is intranasal 53% vs oral 35%. I have noticed pretty bad post nasal drip lately which I thought may be hindering the drug from absorbing via nerve and mucus instead.
  
I guess my main question is how have others on this board managed to bring down their high tolerance down, via other methods than just a break tolerance break, while still being able to relieve their pain?
Did you make any plans with your Dr in using Clonidine or using it in conjunction with a tolerance break?
  
  
Also, was me asking to switch to the fentanyl patch a mistake here? Have there been reports of others having a lackluster response to fentanyl patches via transdermal?
  
  
I'd really like to hear how chronic pain patients have managed to bring their tolerance down and stability to their pain level again.

So i go to the appointment and walked out with a sub RX. I told the doc i was reluctant to start subs and after about 20 min he had me turned around on the idea that i would be replacing one with another.  He told me that I shouldnt think of it as getting on another drug, but that im making a committed effort to stop using heroin. he told me that everything i know about subs and using them as a tool to kick is learned from the streets and most likely from people that were not truly committed to their recovery. 

&#x200B;

So when i got home i talked to my fam about my plan to start with the subs and i felt that they thought i was just trading up heroin to get high with subs. But thats not the case by any means. I felt like they had kinda passed judgment on me over it. like they had just walked in on me with a needle in my arm slumped out.  I didnt even know that he was a doc that could give out a sub RX. 

&#x200B;

CORRECT ME IF IM WRONG PLEASE, but subs dont get you high correct? Im looking for the help in taking cravings away as well as the blocker so i cant get high even if i tried. 

&#x200B;

it really upset me though that they took that type of attitude with me.  I checked myself in to rehab detox and i made the appointment w my doc not to get drugs but to address shit that needs to be addressed. they asked me why na wasnt enough and why i thought subs would help me and how it was actually going to be different. I dont feel that i am a bad person because i am an addict, i just dont know if my fam feels the same. despite all things i have done for them and helped economically and various other ways all i am in their eyes now is a drug addict and nothing more. i have a masters degree and own my home and the one my parents live in. like i said, im not a bad person because i like to get high. 

&#x200B;

i told them i didnt know if they would help but i was going to listen to the doctor who has experience prescribing and helping people like me. im at the point where i am tired of this shit and I need to change. the addict in me says dont take the subs cause i wont be able to get high and that i should keep on keeping on with dope.  I know that it is the disease that is telling me to say fuck the subs and not get that help.  cause i really do feel powerless in it and im hoping to get some of that power back through the treatment.  

&#x200B;

Anyone have a similar experience? any advise on how to deal with them would be appreciated.  Im not excited about starting subs, but i am willing to do what ever it takes at this point cause i am a fucking addict and i want to make shit better for myself. I plan on taking them as the RX instructs and also refrain from other drugs.  I start an iop program monday and im hoping that will help me as well. 

&#x200B;

I know this is kinda a shit post/rant but i have systematically eliminated anyone that will or could hold me accountable for my addictions by moving to a new place. so i dont really have many to talk to and my fam is supportive but doesnt really understand what is going on because they are not and never have been addicts.  kinda sad to think that i gotta reach out to blank faces through reddit to voice my shit..

&#x200B;

if anyone reading this can relate or has something to say to me about it i would very much so appreciate it. 

&#x200B;

im just trying to make moves forward to better myself. i understand that i cant make this shit work for me anymore and that i am not only better off with out it but that all my problems are based around dope. or at least about 99% of them.

&#x200B;

so im not gonna leave my house and go get high right now. im gonna sit here and do nothing cause i know im better off at home in my home where i am safe and most certainly not going to relapse if i stay in place. 

&#x200B;

hope everyone is having a good night.. take care all.

**If I shoot dope now, theres literally no point right? total waste of time/dope/w/e im guessing... then id need to wait like at least 12 hrs or so or until im in WD to get back on sub?** Damnit If I knew I was copping this tonight would skipped that last sub dose.

&#x200B;

Ima prob abstain.... for now, but like I need to sleep, 4mg klon isnt evn touching me.... other than that I have diphenhydramine.....

I was thinking maybe I could split them into quarters and try to finish weening myself off that way.

I ask because for the price it seems like it may be cheaper/possibly more fun? Also I was told in passing that it's best to switch off subs onto another form of opiod when completing one's taper, but I'd like your guys' advice. Thanks",1540015443.0

I’ve been struggling the last 4 months or so. Maybe longer. Getting clean for a couple weeks or a month or so but then relapsing. I know that some do not consider taking suboxone or Subutex as being clean but at this point in my life I need it. I’ve tried using Kratom to keep off the dope but it never really workEd. I never decided to get clean for myself it was always for someone else or some other reason... 

I relapsed a couple weeks ago and I’m beyond done with this shit. Luckily for me, my psychiatrist is licensed to prescribe Suboxone. I have my appointment on Monday at 2:30... 

Anyways, my question is ultimately this. I cannot stand the taste of suboxone, the smell alone makes me want to vomit. Not only that but I seem to get some wicked headaches from suboxone that I do not get from Subutex. If I tell my psychiatrist this, would it be possible to get prescribed Subutex instead of Suboxone? 

I plan on taking the suboxone or Subutex or 7 days before I hop into getting sublocade... my end goal is to ultimately get back onto Vivitrol. Now if I can endure 7-10 of complete abstinence from all opiates and kratom then I can hop right onto Vivitrol...

Things are better now, so I finally made the appointment to get an implant.  Replacing a tooth with an implant involves screwing a post into your jawbone, I would estimate about an inch or so deep if the pictures they showed me are to be believed, then attaching a crown to that when it heals.  

Turns out I have enough bone in my jaw to do this, yay!  Cost is $2300, I assume another $800 for the crown.  I doubt if insurance will pay for any of it, but I've been wanting it for a long time and I work hard for a reason.

So the doctor was evaluating me, explaining to me how it works, and asked me if I had any prescriptions.  I told him about the tramadol I get for my back.  He then tells me that since I take an opiate he won't write me a script for any more.

I'm actually cool with that.  I don't take all my tramadol every month so I have plenty, and they work great with me.  But... what if I weren't in this situation?  Tramadol work no better then aspirin for my husband.  What if that were the case for me?  I'm kinda a wimp and I doubt I would go through with having a chunk of metal screwed into my skeleton without any pain relief.

I'll be fine.  But only by luck.  It just blows my mind that a dentist would have this policy for a case where someone is spending close to 3 grand for an elective surgery.

Ever since I started I told myself and anyone who brought the topic up that same thing, very confidently. I was a smoker who occasionally snorted mostly around holidays when a lot of family would be over and I could not risk the smell. So if smoking wasn’t an option I would have to go the snorting route.. but I would never shoot up is what I would tell myself. All that changed earlier this week. I was extremely upset and without even really thinking about it I found myself in the locked bathroom mixing up a shot. And I’ve been shooting up every day, multiple times a day, since that day. Generally a bit more heroin in the shot every time if the amount of my stash permits me too atleast. Each time I push down on the plunger I’m hoping this is the one that finally does it.. this is the one that finally is too much for my body to handle and takes me life. I’m not happy here.. and I don’t want to be here any longer. I had so many dreams and aspirations for things I wanted to achieve in life.. I’ve given up on them all. I won’t get into it all because I’d be typing all night wasting your time making you read it. But basically I’m sick and tired of being sick and tired. I live at home with my parents and little brother. He’s only a year and a half younger than me, growing up we were literally inseparable. I loved him more than any other person in the world.. actually I still do even tho I’d never admit it to him or anyone else now. Why? Because he hates me. Has for some time now. He’s only spoken to me once in about 2 years until earlier this week. That one time was one sentence “I will kill you”. Now I know he never would because he’s going to med school and would go want to ruin his life but it gave me a glimpse into his current psyche, while he wouldn’t actually kill me himself he secretly wishes I was dead. Doesn’t matter how it happens, he just wants me to die already. Before he told me that I tried talking to him numerous times in an attempt to fix things between us, even offered to stop all drug usage if that was his problem with me(he’s never told me the exact reason why he doesn’t speak to me anymore despite me asking numerous times), but he has no interest in fixing things between us, has no interest in speaking to me ever again or having any kind of relationship with me ever again. Earlier this week he came out of his room while me and my mom were arguing over something more debating I guess neither one of us was yelling or anything like that we just disagreed on the subject and told he interjected to tell me to shut up. As soon as I went to respond my dad blew the fuck up on me, yelling cursing calling me all kinds of names and telling me all kinds of different fucked up things I’d rather not repeat. No one told him to stay out of it, no one told him not to speak to me that way, no one told him anything. Because he is going to become a doctor and I’m a disappointment. He is valued much more than me. In fact I’m not valued at all, I’m a burden something they’re stuck with and wish they weren’t. Almost every day I’m yelled at and told all kind of fucked up things. Well by my dad atleast.. my mom doesn’t even speak to me most of the time sometimes goes literally weeks without saying a word to me. The sad part is I’m even used to it by now. And when she does it’s usually complaining about how much of a burden I am. She doesn’t love me.. but then again none of them do. None of them value me at all. None of them even want me around. So why should I want to be around if none of them want me to be?? I’m no angel or perfect by any means but I try my best to be nice & respectful to everyone... literally the only flaw I have that someone could point out is my substance abuse issue.. and even with that I don’t hurt no one but myself. And it’s not like I do it for fun... I haven’t got high for fun in a long time now... at this point I’m only getting high to escape my misery for a bit. Every night I go to sleep hoping I don’t wake up. To my disappointment I always do... maybe through shooting up I will finally be put out of my misery. It’s hard waking up knowing nobody loves you. Idk why I’m telling you guys all this I guess since I have no one else too.. I’m sorry for wasting your time.. I just can’t take it anymore..",1540006312.0

Is there a significant risk for seratonin syndrome or anything else I should be concerned about?

Absolutely not again.

This is making me sick being a man, jobless, applying myself hard when I can’t even get out of bed practically every day but I don’t want to keep feeling like a quitter & letting myself down & my wife.

I don’t know where to turn, I have the military on delay now, it’s going to take at least 6 weeks of no Valium, 2 weeks of no Suboxone even though my dosage is low but I’m not going through total shutdown mode again from not having Valium in me or even Suboxone.

It's really hard to believe for a junkie like me.

No suboxone. No whiskey. No heroin. No weed. No kratom.

Nicotine? Caffeine? - Yes

Going from vicodin, to oxys, to opana, to heroin, to heroin/coke/whiskey. I just did a little work and got honest about some shit. Its amazing how much my life has changed. Going from homeless, to my own place, in a great city, in less than 18 months.

I hope this resonates with someone... I remember using oxys/opana/alcohol and making close to 100k a year. I remember sitting on my couch that I inherited from my parents, and wanting to buy a side table so bad. I couldnt do it. If I had an extra $50, you and I both know exactly where it was going. I was broke. The money went to one place. Fuck food. Fuck a table. It went One. Fucking. Place. Its amazing today that I actually have money in my bank account to buy the shit that I want. Something so simple, was an absolute impossible fucking task in addiction.

I love you guys. People have been there for me since the old days. I appreciate all of you, and hope you all the best on your journey.

It had occurred to me that I complained about work but shouldn't really be complaining too hard.

This time last year ish... oh my goodness it might've been this time last year. I tried going through my post history real quick to narrow it down but I think I remember this story possibly taking place this time last year because it was before I completely stopped getting subs through Cliff, it wasn't hard decision because he never had them even when he said he did or would anyway!


&nbsp;

What I do remember is that I had work on a Sunday and it was cold outside. I was beginning to ""turn"" as I had woken up for an early afternoon shift at work which ended around 8:30pm. 

I was beginning to turn and the shadow of being dope sick was rapidly moving across the lands of my mind's eye. Although I couldn't' get a couple of extra bags on credit or trade or something from Cliff the night before, I had woken up to one snorted bag or something to get me through work. I hardly got straight. After I was already no longer straight, my first symptom was the yawns followed by the overall sense of it being colder around me.


&nbsp;

For some reason, Cliff said he could give me a couple of bags... I forgot the exact convo but I probably had given him money for subs two days earlier which never showed and I would eventually be paid back in pills or dope. Anyway, that day Cliff offered two bags. So all I had to do was bike back home on my lunch break.


&nbsp;

It was a busy day, back to back customer action... didn't know how I was going to plot my escape, didn't really care about the plot. Just that it had to happen. No promises of ""40 minutes sharp!"" Must avoid being given that order. So I get my ass to my bike and drug closet and beeline out of the establishment. I get my ass on the main avenue, although it's only 6pm it is dark out. My bike ride should be no less than 17 minutes but could be as long as 30 minutes especially if I'm riding dope-sick. Still, on normal re-up days (unlike the one in this story) can do it in 17 minutes, especially if its' nice out and I'm unencumbered by a coat and stiff muscles. Even then I do well as I would often unload my backpack of everything except for a spare inner tire tube and a pump. On the good days he'd say ""the eagle as landed"" and I'd get 20 15mg oxys or buns of dope that I ordered earlier that day just when I needed it!


On this occasion, I get there and am gifted two little shit red bags. Whatever, should get me straight. I also went out of my way to find his sister and her male friend. Somewhere in the fray of rushing I did a line of dope inside and another outside on the deck in the cold wind. That was stupid, I don't remember losing much I didn't lose nothing. I then asked his sister's friend if he had anything and he did for $20. I didn't know it was crack. I used it in snorted form back at work.

&nbsp;

Yeah, I biked back to work in that cold with a $20 back of crack that I thought was heroin to really get me straight. I was gone for 45 instead of 90 minutes. My boy called me while I was at Cliff's house and I had to say I'd be back ... soon. He thought I abandoned my shift. Back then and to this day he still doesn't know why. Now that he will soon no longer be my boss, perhaps I could tell him but I'm weighing on the back burner.


&nbsp;


Anyway, I snorted the bag of crack before returning from a double-long lunch break that was misinterpreted as desertion.


Luckily, I did not get fired and I did not get pressed hard on the personal points of why I did what I did. I was a bit suspect overall at the the time, getting more flu than usual perhaps but mainly the visual.. occasions where I'd have red dry skin beneath my eyes from rubbing so much. This on my face, I could not cover up easily and was challenged to come up with some kind of explanation when it came up in small talk. Sometimes lotion would make it worse, so I would tell the truth in that regard.


&nbsp;

If I was engaging in this junkie behavior the prior year with the prior manager of my department, I would have be F-U-C-K-E-D, at the very least at some point not long after it would become evident that my days are numbered in some way or another. Probably would've gotten near maximum penalty below termination for this offense and then a spate of write-ups on anything and everything that could be used to build an strong HR case against me.

&nbsp;


I am thankful to them in ways they may never know. They being my manager and supervisor. Captain and first officer. My Picard and Riker as my supe is certainly no Spock. Come to think of it, more like Janeway and... Chakotay, I suppose this analogy will have to work. They both have tats. 


One time my supe and a higher manager asked about my eyes/irritated skin after writing me up for being late. Which the write-up itself was fair, I was late quite a bit to that point. But yeah, they were genuinely concerned and I had to just use my go-to reason and assure them all was well and make sure I avoid it in the future best as possible.


&nbsp;


Now they they are leaving, on one angle we may be happy not to have manager who tolerate frequent call-outs from certain employees. Granted, some people really play it up with doctor's notes and a few are genuine. With new management, I may lose the ten minute grace period we get for lateness. They may schedule me a shit ton of hours while bieng part-time. Good and bad.. good for money but bad if you're trying to develop other skills for a better job. The way I see that is, it'll get busy every holiday but there plenty of time during the slower months for busines.


On the other hand a new manager may give me 5 hours a week more than not. That would be worrisome but they probably wont do that because I rock. Still, shit.. change is probably coming. Sigh. I don't know what else to think until more details come to light such as who will replace my bosses.

I had a bunch of needles and syringes in that purse and I'm fucking terrified about the possible outcomes in case someone found it. Some of the needles are used.

I'm fucking terrified. I had my ID card in that purse and, in case someone is going to report it to the police, they will probably suspect me of shooting up dope. I don't shoot up dope and probably never will. I've actually never injected any drug myself. I'm a very casual drug user and by casual I mean DXM, weed, molly and some codeine here and there. I use the needles for self harm. I know it sounds stupid, but whenever I feel like shit I enjoy stabbing myself with needles because it makes the emotional pain more bearable. So I usually go outside,  try to find a dark and quiet spot where I can be alone and I start stabbing my flesh with needles. But if anyone found that purse (and someone surely did), they're going to believe I shoot up and I could be in great trouble. I hope that, whoever found it, is going to take the needles out before reporting it to the police. Or I hope he/she fucking keeps it, I don't need the money and I can go and get a new ID card. But I'm terrified about what could happen to me in this situation. Can I get sued for this? What could happen in this situation? Please someone make calm down.",1539973749.0

Throwaway for obvious reasons. Can someone shed some light on what kind of systems (if any) are in place to prevent filling prescriptions of narcoitics from multiple doctors in multiple states? I'm currently traveling between 3 states for work (Alabama, Arkansas, and Tennessee) on a regular basis. I have a PCP in each state in the event something happens with my condition that requires immediate action. 

I generally have the same doctor fill my rx in my home state, but I have had the others fill the rx on occasion over the last few years. Sometimes I will also end up having 2 of the doctors write the prescription, but in the past I have only actually picked up one to get filled.

Now my question is this - can I have all 3 (or 2 even) write the prescription for me each month and I pick each up and fill them in their respective state? I understand that my insurance will not cover it... and would probably rat on me somehow. The only 28-30 days things you know. But can I insurance one and then pay cash on the other 2? 

I know each doctor runs their individual check to make sure I don't have any other active prescriptions before filling it for me... but I believe (Could be wrong) isn't that within their state only? Or is there some national database? Or do the states communicate with each other? That's the first step of course. And given that I've had multiple doctors actually write the rx for me before, I'm thinking it may not be issue. 

The second step, and more of a concern, is with the pharmacies. Since I've never tried to fill a second or third rx within the 30 day period I'm not sure what to expect at all. If I try to use my insurance I have no doubt that it will get denied and bust me. But what if I pick up the written prescriptions and take them to a pharmacy to fill without using my insurance - or probably a pharmacy I've never used before so they don't have my insurance on file at all. Is there a national database that they look me up in via DL, SS#, etc? Or do they only check with the state database similar to PCP and then insurance (if I use).

Please advise. Thank you.

I started subs about a year ago, but only lasted 3 months before I fucked it up. I tried to see if the same doc would take me back, but she wouldn’t see me again. 

I finally found another doc with an opening. 

The federal rules limiting number of sub patients is counter-productive to the rhetoric we hear about fixing the problem. I think I read somewhere that it’s going to increase, but still... it shouldn’t be difficult to find treatment when you want it. It was difficult for me, and I have money and I have good health insurance. I would imagine it’s even more difficult for those who are on Medicaid, etc... 

But I’ve got to keep with it this time. I don’t care if I’m on subs the rest of my life. I’ve proven to myself that I’m incapable of quitting opiates on my own. And I’m a pretty strong willed individual. I was a crippling alcoholic for a decade, got a DWI and had my “moment of clarity” and just made the decision and quit. Cold turkey. I had some benzos for safety reasons, but other than that, it was just mind over matter. I told myself I was gonna quit, and I fucking quit. Haven’t had a drop in 7 years. I thought that same determination would help me quit the pills, and then the tar, but nope. Heroin continues to show me that it’s stronger than me. I hate it.

I just got discharged from a 5 day detox and am now in the car on the way to a 28 day program. I was kicking a lot of fent, so I got a nice short and sweet Methadone taper in there and it was a relatively comfortable place, especially with all the comfort meds and the very chill relaxed environment. All the nurses were absolutely wonderful, charming and witty which really helped. We messed with them and they messed w us back. Haha. 

Food wasn’t terrible, we had a few decent meals. 3 a day plus 2 snacks, dude. Funny how ‘Breakfast lunch and dinner’ is a simple concept that we tend to forget most normal people do/consume every single day while we’re the ones living with addiction.

There were also a few very good friends I made there. I am oh so grateful for them, bc their hugs kept me stay sane when I was bawling my eyes out after talking to my mother. Each of us had our own demons and we got through that shit together. even tho it wasn’t that long, we were like a little family.


I’m feeling super fucking anxious and hesitant bc the place I’m going to doesn’t do maintenance meds. Don’t get me wrong I like the 12 steps and NA does help me a lot, but after ten years of nonstop rippin and running I personally would feel a lot more stable in my recovery on Methadone.... I’m not happy w this place; my mom picked it and set it up without looking at the one main place I wanted to attend. Some bullshit.


BUT.. maybe just maybe I’ll get through the rest of my wd symptoms and feel ok off all the shit. Idek since honestly at this point in my addiction I really pictured myself getting clean by staying stable on Methadone, going to a clinic daily and working their program... maybe I will still have that plan when I get out of here. But who knows maybe I’ll feel like a million bucks clean off everything, and feel capable without maintenance. I feel that’s highly unlikely but ugh we will see.

I’m so nervous and scared and upset and ashamed of myself.",1539964840.0

I've been on a handful of meds that are supposed to help stop drinking but they haven't worked.

I've reached out to family for support and a cousin told me how he got on a Suboxone program and stopped drinking shortly after. I was like ""WTF?"". That just sounds odd to me, but he showed me his Suboxone films. I've read extensively about Suboxone since then.

I want to quit drinking, but Suboxone seems like a bad idea to quit alcohol. My cousin has been on Suboxone for 6 years since he quit drinking. That doesn't sound like a very fun time. Then again, I can't fucking function whatsoever without alcohol. This is worse than any opiate withdrawals I've ever had.

I know I’ve read plenty of times how ANYTHING that hits your opiate receptors will cause PWD if you take subs too soon even including Immodium but lately have read some conflicting posts on here stating the opposite. 
After experiencing true PWD I have a new fear of subs. At the same time once I reach like 8-10 hrs off gear and truly have nothing to better myself I go into fuck it panic mode to get better. I do have Kratom though. I personally just don’t get much out of it and more then anything it becomes near impossible for me to swallow when I’m in bad WD. But if I had something to help with the 24hrs before I can take subs I feel like I might have a chance. Can you take Kratom during the period of 24hrs off dope to when you can take subs without inducing PWD? If there’s even a chance I know it’s not worth it, anyone that’s been through real PWD will know the same.

The strange thing is I inserted the needle into a vein, doing all what I did before, pulling the plunger back waiting for the plume of dark blood and it never happened, realising I had probably missed the vein I would pull the needle out obviously and when doing so a huge plume of blood would go into the syringe but I still can't find where that point was.

If you have things that you are not supposed to have the moment you enter your room place the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign outside the door. 

Also I know you want to be messy and leave your contraband all over the place, or setup that table with all your vials, blow, clear, 52g of black, thousands of dollars worth of cash and take that I'm trapping in hotels picture and just leave everything there.

Maids will report 100% of what they see, and if you're lucky and I mean boy do you have to be lucky you'll get that maid who will steal your stuff and say nothing.

Even if you have the DND on the door, put your stuff away. There will be 24-48h well fare checks now because of the DND.

You could be like the guy who's friend opened the door while someone was hitting a meth pipe and hotel security walked by seeing everything.

They will not tell you anything is wrong, your keys will be deactivated. They will pretend it was an accident, have you come down keep you occupied getting new keys until Local PD comes and off you go.

Also if you do get that maid who steals your black, please don't come to security and sign a report stating the maid stole your ball of heroin.


Edit: One slipped my mind that's very important, some places still have balconies. Well cameras are watching these and any type of fucking around on these will have security at your door and your stay at the property is immediately ended.

Edit 2: Any type of burnt material that has been obviously smoked in the room. Like a lighter, foil with burnt opiates on it and your toot. If you are in a non-smoking you will receive a minimum of a 1000$ fine at a decent place. 

May or not be reported if no other contraband is in view. 

Edit 3: I know comments are kinda dark and off topic. My only goal is to provide all information I can to keep you safe in all possible situations I am aware of. ",1539947835.0

I am living at my grandparents home at the current moment until i fix my military health checkup, since life at home was hell i decided fuck it, time to leave. My parents thought that i am abusing codeine, since they found my filters that i left hiding instead of throwing them out because i was a lazy, depressed shit.

The one thing that left me curious is - i passed my military health inspections and urine tests, even though i took some codeine 2 days ago. They didn't even inquire me about any medicine use, they didn't find nothing. Yet the drug tests at the clinic did. Could it have been the huge, poppy bagel i ate before the drug test day? I asked the doctor, and she said it was ""impossible"". And now that i failed the test i will have to take another one on Thursday, since i'm meeting a girl who i believe is the perfect woman i'll ever meet in my life, and i don't wanna fuck it up by being an anxious, depressed shit that i was before i started using.

Are 4 days enough for codeine to completely leave the body? Could the huge, poppy bagel fucked up my test and my doctor is just a dumb shit? Thank you in advance, opi fam <3

When at the end 10-25 units, it starts to burn similar to a miss, but it's definitely going into the vein.
