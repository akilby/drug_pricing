sorry for repeating these nightly but we opiate enthusiasts have the memory of a goldfish so people need nightly reminders. here you are.  

we were stripped from having mod privileges for violating terms of service or something so i have to use my private room apparently? it's the same except it has the youtube player and actual moderation. repeat, new room link, same old chat.   

for those who are unaware tc is a video chat platform that while not perfect, seems to work well for phones and browsers alike. this room is for hanging out, listening to music, and specifically harm reduction so no one has to use alone. it is unaffiliated with r/opiates and its moderators and has its own rules and etiquette. here are the revised and updated rules:  

1) don't do any sort of -isms, it's just not cool and i run a leftist room. your opinions are welcome but no personal attacks or nasty stuff about groups of people. if you want to be rude, get personal, there's plenty of stuff to say about people without going for low-hanging fruit.  

2) don't make obnoxious noises over the mic, or play music over the chat. the bitrate for the sound channel is like 4, everything sounds like crap unless it's played through the built-in youtube player.  

3) don't dox anyone or take pictures or record the chat, this is a place people come to feel comfortable doing various things and anything that violates privacy results in an instant ban.  

4) guests must pick a unique username. no lurking allowed because people stalk people and shit. aside from these, just don't be rude or a douche.

I want to make this as short as possible, but please read I need feedback and help..

so over the past 2-3 years I have always felt the need to be high on something before I sleep. whether that was weed, alcohol, pills in my parents cabinet or something. then 10 months ago I discovered kratom. I was headed on the right path. I was smoking weed occasionally, and taking kratom every day and night to sleep. I didn't know much about kratom and its withdrawals so now here I am, trying to get off that. Then, about 3 months ago from now, right around a year long breakup, I snorted heroin which I thought was oxy from a trusted friend.. the heroin was white and didnt feel much different than oxy. I wasnt told what it was until a couple weeks later. anyways, now from that time to now, I have been using more and more. it started occasionally (1-2 times a week, 1-2 bags), now to 6-7 days a week. this past week, it has gone from maybe 1-3 bags everyday or every other day,, to several bags a day (3-5bags). I only ever snorted.

Well now, I am discovering that this is a problem. the cravings are fucking strong, the withdrawals I get are from the kratom I believe, because I dont get any physical ones or anything out of the norm. just depressed, runny nose, restless legs and other cold like symptoms. nothing out of the norm from my kratom withdrawals. so now I have another problem on my hands.

I need to stop this before its too late. I dont want to talk to my parents or really any friends, besides one person I can trust and understands from past benzo addiction.. but would much rather not. 

guys I'm scared and dont know what to do. when I'm on it, I always tell myself this is it (especially these past 3 days). I would always tell my friend like this is it, Im done. then when I'm off, the cravings, minor withdrawals kick in and after a long day at work, I end up buying a half usually. sometimes a bun.. I need the willpower. I need the focus on other things its just so hard, which is why I came here because I know most of you's can relate to me.

any feedback, criticism, questions to understand the situation more would be very appreciated. I know I am headed down the wrong path and just like any other user, we never think we'd be in this situation ever in our lives, until it happens... it happened so fast.

would anyone recommend treatment, me to stop taking everything cold turkey? stop h cold turkey, and continue kratom then taper? taper off all my substances? I love all of you and this community dearly and don't have anyone I can really talk to nor do I want to do that, yet.. thank you. take care everybody <3",1529892579.0
8tmuw4,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8tmuw4/discussion_thread_on_recovery_via_maintenance/,7,https://redd.it/8tmuw4,chasingd0pamine,Discussion thread on recovery via maintenance using self acquired tools,"I wanted to start a thread for people to share experiences with recovery using maintenance tools acquired without professional help. I see people mention self acquiring subs for dry times, but never have really seen anyone share long-term success using self acquired maintenance drugs. What I DO see constantly, is people desperate for help but lacking the resources for whatever reason. 

personal background: I am a chronic pain patient and massive, chronically relapsing heroin addict. I have been clean from dope for 45 days self medicating suboxone illicitly obtained. Been on opiates daily for nearly a decade, using heroin for two years, suboxone is the only thing that has ever kept me away from full agonists. I have never been prescribed, cant afford to currently, and want to share my recovery experience having to cut corners to self medicate with the medication that has saved my life. I will share, and am open to answer any comments (or PM discussion is welcome, too) regarding:

\- advice on a short term suboxone taper

\- advice on long term suboxone maintenance

\- advice on suboxone doses relative to your specific habit

\- advice on different routes of administration less often discussed

\- also have advice for days on using kratom 

  
I invite everyone to share experiences with maintenance methods outside of sub/methadone clinics and without professionals. I will add that you have to REALLY want to be clean in order to make this work on your own, because you will have to cut a lot of corners at times. But it IS possible even when it seems like its not and you are lacking traditional tools. I will touch on price range for suboxone both via prescription and via the streets; using atypical ROA to get the most out of buprenorphine; stabilizing on a dose as low as possible but yet reasonable; and I welcome any questions at all. *I cant speak on methadone as it is harder to obtain especially on a consistent basis illicitly. I personally reccommend people try kratom or suboxone before methadone, especially if youre lacking the funds to do so ""properly"". Anyone with experience on self medicating methadone feel free to share though*

 **I want this to be a thread we can refer people to in the future that want help and dont know where to start without professional/medical help. Note: I am not a doctor, just a recovering junkie/chronic pain patient who wants to help other people in a bind with recovery using maintenance tools.** 

**summary of my specifics and where im at:** When I ended my last run, my habit was using midwest beans of heroin/fent (beans are 100 mg capsules of dope), ranging from minimum 5 beans a day to 15+ sometimes. Mostly snorted, but injected 3-5 times a week or so. In the past I usually used the bernese method to induce, this time I waited til about 28 hours and then induced normally 1mg at a time. I get my subs on the street for $10/8mg. I use half a strip per day. I trade pills or even food stamps to my sub dealer when I have no cash. But speaking cash wise, I self acquire 15 8mg strips per month and it costs me a total of $150, or $5 per day. I never have 150$ at once, and I never buy more than a week or two worth at a time (though I urge you to if you can).

**Price range:** In the name of harm reduction to share info on resources in diff areas (broadly), as a mod **I will allow mention of states but** ***DONT COMMENT ANY MORE SPECIFIC***. First I am sharing street pricing. and AFAIK on dark net they go for like $20 or so for 8mg. I am in new york and they run $10 per 8mg here. I know that in tennessee they go for up to $25 per 8mg and Ive never heard of more than this. AFAIK, thats typical depending on region and how many you buy at a time. Ive never seen them for less than $10each, or more than $25 each. Ive heard of people selling fragments of a strip at a time, accepting trades as payment, etc if you cant afford to lay out lumps at a time. As far as clinics around me, they go as low as $100 a month cash for the visit. Uninsured, I had my pharamacy give me a run down on the prescription cost uninsured, using the biggest availabel discount plan or coupons. I inquired on 60x8mg, as this is the most commonly scripted amount per month. For the name brand Suboxone films, it would be $570. Zubsolv (5.7mg bupe sublingually equiv. 8mg) would be about the same. Subutex (buprenorphine sans naloxone) would be over $700. The cheapest option is generic buprenorphine tablets at $180. These numbers are all based on 16mg per day for 30 day cost, in my area in new york. This is on the cheaper end! Streets are flooded, dark net has them, and for legal/proper acquiring there are some sub doctors that are not horribly expensive out of pocket, and for pain people Pain Management doctors are starting to push bupe as well. 

**Dosing/ROA:** I cut the supply needed in half by opting out of sublingual dosing. Sublingual bioavailability is around 30&#37;, intranasal like 48&#37;, rectal 56&#37;, IV 100&#37;. DO NOT bang your fucking subs people! But you \*can\* stretch and get the most out of buprenorphine  by snorting or plugging. I personally plug my suboxone every day, 4mg per day. My dose is the sublingual equivalent of about 8mg a day, but by plugging I can spend half the money on half the amount of strips by doubling the BA I would get taking as prescribed. I encourage textbook def. ""abusing"" drugs when it is for good reason! I spend $5 a day, even at $25 a strip this would be $12.50 a day. This holds me and keepps me stable coming off  a decent heroin/fent habit. Feel free to tell me your current habit and Ill help you find roughly the dose you could realistically stabilize on. Suboxone is WILDLY overprescribed, but I am grateful for that because the streets are flooded and this  allows me a shot at recovery. 

I realize my specific regimen is not one size fits all, but having pretty extended knowledge (both through experience and through researching extensively) on ballpark dosing, on the most painless taper possible, on ROAs and dosing equivalents etc. There is a ton of misinformation on buprenorphine out there. You probably dont need 16mg/day. 90&#37; of horror stories coming off of suboxone youve heard are due to improperly tapering and jumping at stupid amounts. There are ways to dose it to make it better for pain. Its possible to induce even if you swear you just \*cant\* make it to 24 hours. You can do it on your own if you want it. Ask me anything on suboxone or kratom, message me if you want to discuss privately, share your experience with maintenance that you did on your own without professional/medical help. Lets shut down the incorrect info, discuss tips weve learned, share what hasnt worked, and give hope to people lacking tools and resources. 

**\*\*\* OFFICAL DISCLAIMER you can mention your state in this context for harm reductions sake but no more specific, anyone using this thread to try to source in any way is getting banned\*\*\*** 

TLDR - my experience self medicating with maintenance to treat addiction and chronic pain, ask me anything at all on my experience or input, and share your experiences in the comments. looking for a helpful thread for discussion and information on a topic not discussed often enough. disclaimer im a mod and not welcoming rule breaking of any kind in this post.

Pulled up to this BBQ joint in the hood (best soul food in the city) and grabbed some burnt tips, collard greens and grits. He opted for ribs and slaw. This is the guy who told me i need to quit doing heroin because its going to kill me. Call each other by our real names not our hustle names. He's struggling as a new father and asked for pointers cause im good with kids. Talked about the socioeconomic disparity in the black neighborhood he lives in and how it creates dependency on welfare. Discussed how disenfranchised the youth of today feels and how it probably ties directly into the opiate epidemic. Thats why he became a dboy, he wasn't making enough flipping burgers to support his mom, his sister and his girlfriend and child. Ive asked him before if he feels bad that people have overdosed from his drugs. Today he said to his knowledge nobody has died but when people disappear  he loses sleep over it. He himself has never done heroin and asked me how hard it was to stop and explained its impossible for some people.

The coolest part was when we got the check he said nah nigga i got you man cause lets be honest i've given him thousands of dollars and he also tipped really well. gave the waitress a 20 and a bunch of ones on a meal together that only costed 20.

After 10 years of usage, a single fuck up resulted in John’s parents finding out his secret and creating major hurdles in his recovery.","They found out. About him of course, but not me. I’m still in the clear...for now.

2 weeks ago John’s crazy ass went on a vacation with his father and brought ten 40 mg OPs instead of dope. (For reference, he usually uses ~20 blue bags a day.) Perhaps he might’ve been able to take the hit of a few sweaty days if he weren’t hiking-the-fucking-Grand-Canyon. But let’s be honest, this was a stupid move.

Anyway, I did what any good fiancé would do and I shipped him enough dope to hold him over. My biggest regret is roaming the hallmark isle of the drug store and refusing to settle for anything less than the most perfect, lovey-dovey, “my ❤️ is wherever you are,” card to ship it in. Sure, I changed my name and address on the return section of the envelope and didn’t leave a single finger print to trace it back to me, but this made for a lot of explaining when his father intercepted the package...The one thing we didn’t think of. 

John’s parents are your typical preppy, middle class, divorced white folks who drink a few too many glasses of wine at dinner and get a bit carried away with judging other people on Facebook. 

“HEROIN?! You’re going to DIE if you use even one more time!” 

“What a terrible father you are!”

“You don’t love us, or you would just stop.”

 ...Just some of the cringey things they’ve said that mirror every naive Heroin parent’s thoughts and fears. 

They don’t understand the concept of withdrawals. They don’t understand the difference between blowing/smoking/shooting...etc. They don’t understand the similarities in chemical makeup between H and prescribed opioids. All they know is what is portrayed by the media; which is that prescription pills are dangerous, but Heroin is a certain death sentence. They regurgitate this stigma like a bulimic teenage girl purging her 1st and last meal of the day.

Of course there is so much I wish I could tell them to ease their minds, even in the slightest....that John knows what he is doing, he knows what he is getting, that it goes through several other people before it reaches him, that he’s deathly afraid of needles and would never shoot up, that he is not out on the street copping from strangers with heavy Fentanyl or Carfentanyl cuts, that he is functional, that he is still a wonderful father, that he has been trying desperately to kick the habit and was planning on taking some time out of work in the coming months. 

Not that they would even believe me if I did tell them any of these things. These minor reassurances would only serve to incriminate me—if not as a fellow user, than as a (sic) “remarkable enabler.” 

Predictably, when John returned from his vacation, his parents sent him straight off to detox and then rehab. He did surprisingly well at first, completing his stay at detox and getting through his first full day at rehab (the rehab he was sent to was a separate holistic facility, about 45 mins away.) Problem was, he was not fully detoxed and now he was stuck at a place that did not have the means to help him. (They wouldn’t even give him a god damn Advil!) 

So like any other miserably sick addict would consider in his circumstances, he bailed. 

I had warned his parents about the shit-quality of the detox they sent him to. (Little did they know, I had been there just weeks before and failed miserably due to their inadequate treatment.) I begged them to choose another place, but they didn’t want any part of it.  Some former addict with a certificate in addiction counseling told them this facility was the best in the state and they believed him. John’s parents were all-knowing experts and I was just a foolish little girl, or so they thought. At this point they weren’t even really talking to me, actually. They believed I either sent the drugs myself or that he was cheating on me. Both theories made things incredibly awkward for me. 

When they finally came around and decided to include me in the conversation, the first thing they asked was who the woman was whose name was on the card John received. I told them I assumed it was a woman named “Jane” he used to work with who was head over heels in love with John. I suggested that perhaps he used her weakness for him to get what he needed. A stupid excuse, but it seemed to work for now. 

Much to my surprise, his father was on a witch hunt to track down our dealer. (What the fuck, man.) I’ll never understand his desire to want to destroy someone else’s life. As if it will somehow save his son.

Everyday for the last two weeks, I’ve received  a call from one of our friends informing me that John’s Dad called to interrogate them about tracking down “Jane” or whoever his dealer is.

Unironically, our state just passed Kristen’s law, (which for those who are unfamiliar with it, could sentence dealers to life in prison if caught). Mind you, our dealer is also a user like so many others and could use help and support far more than the kind of draconian punishment John’s father is seeking to charge him with. This guy is the kind of person who would hang himself if he were sentenced to more than a week in prison. He could never ever handle punishment this severe. 

I cannot put into words how angry this garbage legislation makes me. I called and lobbied for weeks trying to prevent this bill from becoming law, but sadly, too many politicians in our state are more concerned with appealing to the vulnerable and naive families of OD victims and getting re-elected, than listening to every god damn substance abuse professional and organization within a 50 mile radius of us who testified against it. It doesn’t help that this is a mid-term election year, (but I digress.) 

When John left rehab, his parents called me immediately and told me I wasn’t to let him come home. Um, what? Not going to happen. They were utterly PISSED when I refused to do so. His mom responded by calling me a “remarkable enabler,” making (technically semi-accurate) assumptions about my past knowledge of his use and going as far as saying “Fuck you!” to me, for refusing to adopt their “tough love” approach with John.

Whoa. Okay, so maybe I kind of get it. You’re both frustrated and need someone to blame and I am an easy target—much like the mystery dealer whose life you want to destroy. Somehow that still doesn’t make this any less hurtful and frustrating. 

I tried my best to explain to them that in my “experience” in dealing with addicts (my sister and mom are both addicts and I happen to treat addicts for a living), a more compassionate and shame-free approach is much more effective. I told them we should be fostering an environment that allows John to feel comfortable talking to us and that we shouldn’t be angry with him for leaving—instead we should hear him out and do our best to provide positive reinforcement and remind him why sobriety is worth pursuing. 

(But hey what do I know, anyway. It’s not as though I’m an actual addict. 😳) They argued that my approach has failed from the beginning—which actually isn’t true since I haven’t made a solid effort since MY tough love phase years ago and prior to picking up the habit, myself. The argument was going nowhere so I ignored the texts that followed, which involved nothing more than the two of them berating me for being so “foolish and naive.” 

When John came home that night, I watched as he blew 15 bags at once. (What the actual fuck, John. I’m trying to justify your irresponsibility in my head, but you’re not making it easy.) 

He looked up at me when he finished and saw me start to tear up. “You have to go back. Your parents are going to hate me forever if I don’t prove to them right now that I can—“ before I could even finish my sentence, his phone went off. It was his mother telling him “not to listen to me” and that I “don’t have his best interest in mind.”

That god damn text hurt us both more than it should have. “I know,” he said. “But let’s go get some food right now. I’m starving and I miss you so much.” 

He clung to me like a toddler, that night. We talked all night about our hopes and dreams for the future. We cuddled and cried and laughed until the sun came up...

He knew he needed to take advantage of this opportunity to get clean. After all, his parents were throwing down $15k for him to go to a top-notch rehab. And despite all of the weird holistic/anti-western medicine treatments they practiced there, he believed it was a pretty damn good facility, considering the typical standards of this industry. 

But first, he would need to go through detox again. Bleh! I think I hated the idea of him leaving me again more than he hated the idea of having to suffer through withdrawals again. But with 10 years under his belt and 5 under mine—we knew what we were in for. Suffering is simply unavoidable with this drug.

The next morning he re-packed his bags, we did some laundry together, grabbed a quick breakfast and I drove him off to another detox facility.

His parents were shocked to hear that he was going right back—so shocked actually that they apologized for their less-than-kind remarks towards me. It felt good to be the one to tell them.

Today is day 3 of John’s detox. I went to see him yesterday. He was visibly ill, but pushing through without med assistance. I think this time will be a bit easier for him since he did most of the work last week, prior to his single relapse. But we’re not out of the water yet and won’t be for some time.

As for me, I’m cutting back by 1 bag a day—which sucks worse than it sounds—but the plan is to taper down just enough to be able to pull off a 72 hr cold turkey detox in a few weeks when the tension with his family has died down. 

Keep us in your thoughts, y’all.

We can’t afford to keep dancing on the edge of this cliff...as beautiful as the view is, we have too much to live for.

Didn't even drink until my career exploded (in a good way). First drink I had was on my way to an event in Los Angeles, coming from a small town on a small island in Scotland this was just so wild for me. I had a vodka and coke and thought it was rancid and ruined the flavour of the coke.

Years later I get some chronic pains showing up. The doc gives me cocodamol. I joke to friends about it being a ""hardcore superdrug"". It's fun though... one night when a friend's dad died I went on a walk up a hill back in Scotland. Well okay a mountain that overlooked the rest of the world below. I was just stood up there taking photos thinking that even though my friends event is sad that at least he got to live a long life and got to produce good kids. I got back home and watched a bluray film called Nausica. Life felt good.

But of course that feeling is fleeting. I wanted more. Told the doc my pain was getting worse and was put on Tramadol. Now this sucked. It was providing so much reward and happiness in my brain that I stopped doing fun stuff. My fame was getting lost but I felt okay through it all. Ho hum! But then I ended up in a deep depression. I got out of it months later.

Nowadays I buy Codeine in large quantities from online pharmacies. I usually have 1-8 days worth in a single day. It's a bit crazy and even no matter the dose it doesn't get my high as it once did. I've been thinking about changing to a different medication but it's too hard to (semi legally) get oxycodone and its friends here. And the docs don't give it out either. Like... the route is Cocodamol, Codeine, Tramadol, DHC, morphine! I think end of life people can get Fentanyl. Always wondered what that's like.

These days I just live off my royalties from my previous life and spend too much on these weak drugs. I keep wanting to quit them. I quit Trams cold turkey once and oddly found it not too difficult... I just reminded myself that the only reason I felt bad was externally chemically induced and it would be okay soon. Weirdly easy like I say... But now I find I can not take codeine and everything is okay. Before I went all in I used to buy Loperamide as a replacement and found that worked absolute wonders. No kidding! It lasted longer than codeine, was more mentally happy. Just much better except for that super long peak waiting time. 5 hours for me! 

I keep wanting to come back to earth. I'd like to buy a ranch or something in America and be a liberal chap out there in the countryside/mountains running a bunch of studios where people can come in and create whatever they wanted. Or abandon everything fun and exciting and become a house renovator.

My partner supports me through all this. They're a great person. Totally straightedge (except in the bedroom) but also understands that my body is in a lot of physical pain and is more or less okay with as things are. But if I ever told them I wanted to quit they'd be there the whole way for me too.

I guess I'm rambling because I have no one else to talk to this stuff about. Everyone thinks I'm this wholesome person. I guess I am but theres also the fact that 1) everything hurts and 2) I get help with that. I feel like I'm retired now. I'm halfway to retirement age but have decided to take everything so slow and leisurely. I might even take a nap now. No, I will.",1529860695.0

I know when I was using I had to help explain to my mother (RN) when to use different medicines. 

Here’s what’s going on: the other day- I felt like I was having a heart attack. My chest got super tight and it felt like my heart was beating out of my chest, and I’m assuming my blood pressure was through the roof
I almost decided to go and check myself in at the ER, but decided not too. 

When I was younger (8 years ago) I used to get the numbing feeling (pins and needles) in my heart and it felt super serious but attributed it to opiates and my spice use. 

I don’t know - I’m 22 and don’t eat fast food or drink soda, (just black coffee and water). Wondering what y’all input is on this.

Day 9 today.,"Not gonna lie the last couple days I was really nervous about the fact that the day of the wedding (my cousins, I was a bridesmaid) was approaching... and the day before, on Friday, I had a mental moment of weakness. my junkie brain was telling me to cop and I knew I had to take the appropriate steps to stay clean. 

I was freaking out... I remembered what my new friends from NA said to do, and so I reached out to another addict, one who is a friend from this sub that I have grown to know pretty well actually. This person was there for me immediately when I stated that I needed help and someone to talk to for a while, just to help me stay clean. Even if just for one more day.

They picked up the phone and called me immediately. Cue a 4 hour phone call where they dealt with my stupid ass constantly doubting myself, saying I was waiting for a call or text....They assured me that I do have the strength to do this, and that I know it within my subconscious. They told me over & over that I am capable of living the clean life, one that after over 10 years of addiction just feels so fucking foreign to me.


I just wanted to make a post recognizing the important of being there for our fellow brothers (and sisters, too; I didn’t forget ya’ll... but we say brother here, u cockjaw) 😂 

and I guess I just wanted to extend the offer to anyone on this sub: don’t be afraid to message me if you ever find yourself in a moment of weakness. You guys are worth the effort required to live clean. 

And again I’m grateful for this angel bc If it weren’t for them, who knows what I may have done! I needed some sense knocked into me, and luckily a long phone call was just enough.

One, I was thinking about my previous birthday. I had money guaranteed to come to me in a card, enough to buy dope as well as components and supplies for my hobbies and bike.

The thing is, I arranged for the middle to expect my call the following afternoon right after work. Though, I was also hoping that I'd wake up for work at 6AM and have the card and cash waiting for me. That would've allowed me to get the ball rolling that much earlier. I was owed half a bun the night before, so I squaffed it all up because I couldn't wait even though I could physically wait. 

&nbsp;

So then my family member who was giving me money, was up really late and went to bed not long before I woke up. So was just hoping that when I get off work nine hours from the time I woke up, that the card would be waiting for me. 


Now of course, I knew it would suspicious to come home from work, receive the card and money and then dart out the door again. If there were a any lingering doubts about me not being on the straight and narrow -- this would affirm such doubts.


&nbsp;


Thus I came up with a cover story which wasn't completely untrue. Said that I needed to buy something wholesome from a store that closes an hour after I get off work. My family member says, ""I'll give you a ride you if you need one, there's a chance of rain."" Well, I can bike to the shop to get the part I need, and it's good to have the bike with me to take measurements of the part I'm replacing but I had to think.. to take the ride or not. It would possibly look less suspicious, but would also impose delays into the whole process of procuring dope. 

&nbsp;

In the end I just had to play it by ear when I got off work and not be obvious in my true actions. Took a few minutes extra to measure my old parts before departing to go to the store for the new parts. Also warned my middle during the work day about the liklihood of delays on my end but that my order was a certainty, just a matter of when. 

That's funny, so many times when I've been told, ""it's just a matter of when"", I was being lied to by the likes of Cliff. Oh well, my middle knows I'm a straighter shooter than that.

&nbsp;

**BTW the middle that gave me [""Jewish"" spices in place of dope](https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8sn777/requesting_help_in_identifying_kosher_seasoning/?ref=share&ref_source=link) gave me real dope two nights later.* That was two nights ago for that matter. He called me at 3am and said he had it. I was surprised but glad. The only thing that annoyed me was the fact that I ordered that shit on a Wednesday afternoon and was now receiving it on a Friday night into Saturday morning at 3am. Doing dope that late fucks up one's sleep. Furthermore he didn't give me a five bags like I paid for, he gave me four and said he'll give me the fifth one later or in a couple of days.

Naturally did some right away and saved two for the following day of work. Since I took a nap right after work, I was able to take a sub when but I should've gotten my shit on Wednesday when I ordered it.


Of course that last bag... he could only give it to me when he middles for someone else or buys some for himself. Not worth my time to keep asking.

It's about a biologist who encounters a physicist working as a bagger for Walmart, his name is Johann Ritter. Turns out he was born in 1776 and has attained immortality, though the exact means through which he did so remain unknown. It's narrated in three different styles: protagonist (contemporary German), physicist (pompous, purple 18th century German) and the narrator, who happens to be the Devil himself! It's a Faustian type deal through which immortality was awarded to Ritter. Great book,9/10.

Also reading Suttree, by Cormac McCarthy of Blood Meridian and The Road fame. It's hilarious, biblical, poetic, EVERYTHING. Read it! Amazing prose, I've heard it described as a Southern Ulysses or a ""doomed Huckleberry Finn"", which is spot-on.

8tetcz,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8tetcz/nearly_a_month_clean/,3,https://redd.it/8tetcz,DopeGuy1234,Nearly a month clean,Hi my second Family. I am at day 29 of my clean time. Nearly a month now. I never thought that I would make it so long. I never thought that I would be a week long clean in the last 1 and half year. I consumed 3-5g a day on the street level dope here in Germany. In my area dope got a purity of 30 percent. I got dope directly from the big man so my dope hada purity of 90 percent. Mostly I got it directly from the kg brick. They cut my 6g off of the brick I used every week. I got myself into a German detox facility with rehab times sometimes. I used to get 120mg diazepam plus doxepin 150mg a day.I still get the 150mg Doxepin a day now. I am 2 weeks out now and I nust used benzos and opis directly after I got out. I had tilidin and clonazepam with me when I got out. I drove with the bus home and took 3x2mg and 700mg of tilidin in the bus. I even didnt get high but I will get high in the next days when I get dope. So you guys know how I can use a Paysafecard without the registring shit? I just want to use the code but thats Impossible without login? I hate that shit! Happy nods fam and to everyone trying to get sober. You can do this dude and duderinos. love ya. ,1529807213.0

Don't shoot, either make gunpowder/cheese, or monkey water. I've tried smoking it a few times, but it's just not for me. 

Anyway, the stuff is in little corners of sandwich bags and tied off, you know how they do it. So last night I was having a lot of trouble getting it out. So much was stuck to the bag itself. I was literally ripping off peices of the plastic accidentally while trying to get it out. I got what I could out of it, but I felt like probably a third of it was just stuck on the plastic. I ended up just having to put the tar baggie in a little bit of water and mixing it around till it all came off and then using that as my monkey water. 

I'd much rather get most, if not all of it off, so I can make gunpowder with it. What kind of tips do you guys have for getting the tar out if the baggie? I know freezing it will help, I'm just hoping I can get some more suggestions. Thanks in advance for any help.",1529803207.0

For anyone who doesn't know, scramble is dope/fent mixed with...something...and put into gel caps for either 6 or 10 bucks. Two 6 caps or one 10 cap is a single serving. 

Well, the scramble is all I can reliably find in the area. And on the upper side of the binto an irritating issue trying to mix them in the syringe. No matter what I do, when I put the two together, they solidify somewhat! I've tried heat, no heat, mixing them in the same spoon, in separate spoons, pulling up the dope first, and pulling up the crack first. I don't know what else to try at this point.

So what I'm wondering, science people of r/o, is what ingredient in these two conglomerations is causing this (I assume) chemical reaction? I'm kinda guessing it's the baking soda in the crack reacting with whatever the inactive ingredient in the scramble is, which I don't know what it is. It apparently used to be quinine back in the day, but I doubt it's that any more. Also-I'm using grape kool-aid powder to break down the crack. 

It's still somewhat injectable even when it clumps up, I did and it went in fine and just left the solids at the bottom of the syringe after I shot the rest. Still, I can't imagine it's overly great to be shooting something with particulates like that in it. So, if anyone knows why it's doing that, I would also greatly appreciate if someone could help me fix that issue. 

Damn this got long, can y'all tell I'm speedballin'?? 

Tl:Dr- Love speedballs. Can only get scramble and crack. Mixing them makes it semi-solidify in the syringe or on the spoon. Why and how do I fix it?",1529798873.0

And holy shit, am i thankful i did.

So it was a unique day for me, since we were recording our debut EP, so i  decided i should do codeine a bit earlier than scheduled because i was  in the studio recording shit and i couldn't concentrate to save my life.  I was planning to leave the codeine for a party i was having later that  evening, but since we were way off schedule i decided to skip it and  just take the codeine to make the most left of my recording session. I  filtered out about 1600mg of codeine (had some old leftover residue i  refiltered + 1500mg of regular pharm grade codeine w/APAP) downed 20mg  of citerizine and drank the codeine.

And holy shit

The  trip was intense, not as intense as the one i had from H, but needless to say - i was swaying left, right and could barely keep my  balance for a few minutes. I felt a bit of itchiness from the histamine  release, but nothing else much noteworthy - just an intense, euphoric,  pleasurable high which left me zoned out into music for a good 3 hours.

Even  my band member asked if i didn't get bored recording the same riff over  for 3 hours to get the ""perfect take"". Hah, got close. Was one of the  most productive studio sessions in my life.

And  before you mention placebo - i didn't expect anything, i was kinda  expecting it to be less intense than it was. Words cannot describe how  that 300mg improved my high. Maybe it's because of the dexamethasone i  took 2 days ago? But it couldn't have been that, since i took codeine  the day before this trip (first day of recording and setting up amps) so  my tolerance was pretty high, although i only took about 900mg and it  left me cranky and unproductive afterwards.

TL;DR the trip was way more intense than the usual codeine 1200mg i was doing. So, yeah. I disspelled the myth for myself and i will now be upping my dose of codeine to 1500mg. The high was so intense - i want to break my schedule of once a week and do it again soon, and that fucking scares me.",1529793229.0

It just isn’t happening. Too many days gone by spent high, too many bridges burned. Lately I feel like tossing my own urn off the old railroad trusses behind my house where I spend my best days, in high or sober ways.]

---

I once had the best moment of pure euphoria on the aforementioned railroad bridge after a serene walk with my best friend. (so long dude. I drove you away for good). I’m sure the fentanyl had little do with both, right? Yeah. Fucking right. The devil was inside my bones, but I felt better than I have ever felt. I felt invincible. I was the prototypical me, I created things. I was a master. I wrote poetry which would blow you away, and I didn’t even know where the words came from. I was applying for manual labor jobs, something I had never even tried or considered as a skinny ass emo/skater dude all my life. 

I was driving trucks even though just being in a car used to make me a nervous wreck. My family was happy for me. It looked like I had turned over a new leaf. I had stopped smoking pot, which was something I had done for years straight. It’s a possibility it made me lazier somewhat, I’m not denying that. When I quit I didn’t even do it on purpose, it was just that this other drug was so good nothing else mattered. Fuck coffee. Fuck weed. Fuck even eating real food, give me a fentanyl lollipop and some ice cream. That is all I ever craved food-wise was ice cream. It’s in a class of its own. (I’ve seen my own father who is on the same drug eat gallons of the stuff. It’s really a spectacle.)

I woke up one morning and realized I felt too sick to even get out of bed and reach for my fent patches, I had hidden slyly hidden under my audio receiver. In retrospect, what kind of hiding place is that? (considering I have an audio nerd for a father). There was not much logic going through my head in this period. However, there were many songs in my head. I wrote ballads that seemingly were beamed down to me from the nether realm, because I don't know where the hell those words came from. The notes just slid off my fingers while playing guitar too. It felt like cheating. “Now I know...”, I thought, “how all those junky artists created such brilliant things.” I had discovered the cheat code to life, and it was incredible. 

At night though things took a turn, I became alone and trapped. When my company was gone, which was rare during this time, I would just nod out on the couch watching adult cartoons through the corner of my eye every 10 minutes when I could manage to open them. I was fucking strung out like hell. I had a nearly infinite supply of the strongest legal for human use, opiod on the market. I was chewing those damn patches like gum, and my friends must have thought I was insane when trying to explain. “Oh it’s just a little pain patch, hehehe”… What a joke. Somehow these friends stuck by me, for now. They didn’t realize the scope of what I had done to myself as I did. I had become a full-on opiod junky, and the worst part of it was I was completely aware of it. It isn’t like the naive old lady who goes to the doctor for Percocets and becomes dependent. She hasn’t studied the exact psychology/pharmacology that goes into addiction. I feel like it honestly made it worse that I understand why* I was hooked.”All this dopamine I’m lacking here without chemical influence”, and another, “if only I weren't a treatment resistant chronic depression and anxiety case already before the junk”, all these justifications like this we have to continue using, they don’t mean shit at the end of the day when we lay our heads down yet again, an addict. 

One day my best friend and also roommate called me as he usually would around 7:30A.M. “Hey bro, you ready?” It was time for one of our early morning classes at the community college we were now attending. God knows I already fucked up the whole university deal. I had just gotten out of sitting in a bathtub, trying to calm down my extreme lack of temperature regulation. Sometimes during withdrawal the few seconds of warm water are your only refrain from the pain and agony.

 I reluctantly agreed that I was in fact ready even though I felt like death on a stick. I was testing out how sick I would get without fentanyl today. My friend pulled up in a few minutes, and I got in the car. He asked me for a drink of my water. “Wait, are you sick?”, he asked. My friend was a severe hypochondriac. “No, it isn’t that kind of sick”, I assured him. “Oh, well as long as you’re just dope sick...” Feeling like somewhat of a diseased leper didn’t seem to help my already unwell and agitated state. We drove out the loop of my blacktop drive, and I already had a bad feeling for what was to come.

We crossed the mountain via the great big interstate which connects our little rural village to the outside world. We are just simply a piss stop for the rest of the world, a cut off, isolated mountain town where everyone’s nosey about each other’s business, and the only actual businesses are pharmacies, Dollar Stores, and funeral homes. Oh, and churches of course. At least we do have God on our side... Except that we are all on doctored-ordered drugs (heroin isn’t huge here), beer or moonshine. I stare out the side of the passenger window at the beautiful mountains below and think how I used to get stoned on top of the hill right above this interstate and just stare down at nature. Man, I wish I could appreciate things of beauty now. Everything looks fucking grey, it’s all the same. That’s the worst part about drugs, and it’s the same with all of them for me (even antidepressants). They zap the color from life.

Finally, we pull into the exit. Now if you think my description of my town sounds shitty, this is worse. It is considered one of the poorest areas in the state and also the meth hotspot for our county. There is only one main road, and we drive it slowly as to not fall into the speed trap. I can feel my stomach starting to turn now as I cringe at the McDonalds sign above. “hey bro, you want some mickey dees?”, my friend asks. “No.” I say with a firmness I have never used before. “I’ll just eat my trail mix”. I brought some because I can’t go without breakfast ever, even while a junky. I scarf down some M&Ms and peanuts and raisins, while trying to calm my anxiety with the soft guitar on the radio, courtesy of The Shins. (I was the source for all my friend’s musical tastes, an expert in his eyes).

Now we are pulling into the school, and the dread is coming to a head. It floats up my stomach and feels like love butterflies in my chest except they are black and rotten. As we are walking in, I see this really cute girl that sits across from me in class. I smile at her as we both turn our heads back towards the front of the school. At this exact moment, it hits me. I have to fucking throw up and I have to do it right now. I’ve heard this can happen in withdrawal though I have always had an iron stomach until today. I rush over to the curb, not more than 25 feet from the door (and my crush  at the time) and proceed to projectile vomit all over the crabgrass. Ah, that feels better. 

I wipe my mouth, and scoff it off as I walk inside and head to my class. My friend is simply shaking his head, and I still don’t know if that girl saw me. As I walk into the narrow corridors of the community college, I imagine just how mundane this really is. There must be hundreds of little schools that are built just like this, with as many mediocre classes and teachers too. Hey, it’s cheap.

I turn right into a door that appears the same as every other, and I’m in my class. I look at the teacher, and she immediately knows why we are late. These bloodshoot eyes tell stories. I ask her for a piece of gum in front of the entire class, heavily implying that I just threw up everywhere. She told us to just go home, and so we did. 

---

Some more months of this cycle go by, as I slowly fall out of going to my classes, and then literally start falling out of life. My habit has gotten worse, fast. I’m now wearing and chewing fent patches, and rarely leaving the house for any reason. My friend and roommate is sick of my shit, and gone back to his grandparents. 

It was around this time I considered trying to get clean “for good”. I flushed all the remaining patches I had in a fit of rage. After this event at school and last night, I’m over it. I should explain that I fell out for the tenth time probably on the couch one morning, around 6am, after being in my usual nod state for the entirety of the night. I woke up to Hank Hill saying “damnit Bobby” and suddenly having to puke, as I gazed at my red hot foot right next to the space heater where I wore a patch or two. I probably had a piece of another in my mouth as well.

Fuck, my stomach feels like daggers are poking into it again, as I run dizzy to the bathroom, marking the very first time in my entire using career, even with future IV use, that I ever threw up from any opiod dose. I have a natural tolerance to all drugs somehow. As I sit in my sweat-soaked boxers, hugging and staring down into the toilet, I saw my pink and green stomach bile (the result of eating nothing but fucking tootsie rolls in the last day). It was around then I knew it was time for a change. However, little did I know change is hard to come by...",1529784628.0

For example this is my story. After I got out of the sober living, I moved into a new apartment with  one condition: that I get drug tested once a week. Fine whatever that’s life. Plus now I can smoke weed (drug test for the parents; piece of mind for their time/ the least I can do.)

Well, after about a month of doing the drug testing, I noticed pattern of some really lazy drug testing. So me being me I push it to the limit but I’m also freaking out because I’m taking a huge gamble here. What do I do? Well, all the research online regards to drugs in your system really emphasize the idea of being healthy and exercise. So that’s what I did; started right then and there. Thankfully I pass the test and I felt like a cheated death again. I attributed it to the exercise and eating. Every time I used after that I was extremely afraid of what might happen drug test thus the exercise and the eating; I’m kind of nut health-wise. Stop smoking. Took up yoga. Shit like that. My parents even acknowledge how good I was looking and started taking health tips from me the junkie.

Here is the kicker;I just found out that the tests I take are the new five panels! My DOC is oxy so even if I rolled in high I could have passed that shit. I got into shape and found a new hobby for nothing!

Serious tho it’s one of the few times this addiction as actually helped me. Nothing like kicking will doing your flow!",1529774580.0

Tldr: chipping oxy and methadone for nerve damage and to function and get on with get into a high paying job. This is an oncoherant xan ramble but let me knoe whay ypu reckon. Methadone or weed and benzo script or go through hoops and get fuck all from pain management. but i just want to move on with life after abit of mental and physical trauma plus ptsd, gad, depression and mild bipolar(current diagnosis) n a few more things.

2. Go to a methadone clinic and get a decent dose for pain, find decent dose, get shit together then taper

Now for the bad part- I didn't realize it was fetsnyl so I was withdrawling bad around 4PM. I didn't know how I was going to get more becsuse I forgot to save that dealers number (even though I'm sort of glad I didn't becsuse even if the shits fire I prefer something with legs) 

Fast forward until night time

I was dope sick all mfing night,  shaking, sweating, can't sleep, puking. 

Dealer is out of town for FOUR DAYS I was like wtf am I gonna do? Other dealer wouldn't answer at all. ***fuck***

Then a random number texts me AT 4AM! saying ""Jay left me his stuff to sell""

I said can I come through now she said yes. 

I wake my girlfriend (who doesn't do dope at all so she wasnt happy). We lesve around 430AM and get their around 515.

The girl selling the shit was already waiting outside for me. Normally i pay $40 for a half but I got two half grams for $70 this time. 

Normally it takes me forever to find a vein so if I'm really sick ill muscle, but I found a little vein by my thumb and hi

Not the greatest stuff,  didn't have me nodding crsxy but it gave me that amazing eupboria, energy and my favorite part THE ITCHIES (not even sarcastic I loveee itching) 

I also love the taste of the dope you get in the back of your throat from the dope (you know what I mean) 

Only thing that could of made today better would of been some benzos

8t9ket,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8t9ket/my_little_dope_fueled_story/,3,https://redd.it/8t9ket,Curiosity_glides,My little dope fueled story..,"(Long) Robert and I are parked in a fast food parking lot, and it’s pretty busy. We came to get some water and a couple burgers, but me being the little idiot I was back then, decide I want to shoot up right there in my car, and Robert says he is also down to shoot right then and there. So I break off a piece of the beautiful tar, as black as a freshly paved road, shinny and almost clean looking, and I drop it onto the bottom of a Arizona Tea can. I mix it up using the plunger on the freshly opened syringe. Just stirring gently as the thick tar melted into the water. It didn’t take long, and when it was nice and mixed, I dropped my little piece of cotton into the dark liquid. I stuck the needle into the cotton, and sucked the liquid into the syringe. It was a beautiful golden brown liquid filling half of the 1 cc syringe. I was ready to rise up to heaven.. 

The veins in my arm are hard to raise, and I hated dealing with trying to tap into them. I also was lucky enough to not really scar, I was careful and never left easily visible track marks. For these reasons, I opted to use the veins in the back of my hand to tap into. They were close to the skin, and easily accessible. So, I have Robert wrap his hands right around my wrist, to act as a tie off. I grab the steering wheel of my Chrysler, and slowly slip the needle into the perfect little vein. I pulled back the plunger and saw the dark red blood flow into the syringe *yes!* I thought to myself, because I got it perfect on the first try. So I slowly push down the plunger, and have my friend release his grip as I do. Instantly I feel the warm rush, like a tidal wave, but instead of cold ocean water, it’s water that feels warm, and smooth, better than any thing you can imagine. I have had some crazy drug experiences, and some crazy orgasms, even both at the same time. But nothing I had ever experienced could match this rush. It was pure bliss, like being sucked into heaven and embraced by god himself, I had reached nirvana, the perfect shot, the perfect high, until it became too much. The rush didn’t stop, it didn’t peak, it became overwhelming..

Robert had to grab the syringe from me, and look at me asking if I was okay. All I could reply was “I don’t think I can handle this” I was not overdosing, I was still conscious and breathing, but the high was so intense I started to fade in and out of consciousness. Let’s not forget I was in my car, in a busy fast food parking lot, and now I was so intensely high I thought I was going to die. Suddenly I see two cops, male and female, walk right by the car. This female police officer was one of the toughest looking ladies I have ever seen. I was so relieved when they kept going and went inside of the building. Now from here is where my memory gets hazy..

I some how managed to drive (yes this was very stupid, I could have killed Robert and myself and I regret that I did this) to Roberts brothers apartment. We get there and he gets me inside and I immediately start to apologize and explain what is going on. They are actually very understanding, I think a little annoyed, but understanding. They told me I was just too high, and that I would be fine. This reassured me, but I was still feeling waves of extreme eyeball rolling euphoria, it was amazing, and scary as all hell. I ran to the bathroom and immediately throw up. I don’t make a mess thank god, but I throw up a lot. Once that stopped I went and sat down on a small couch they had in a side sitting area, at this point I start to nod off, and literally lose giant chunks of time. This is hard to explain so let me try..

I was sitting there, and my eyes would close, and i would suddenly wake up and it’s 15 minutes later. But it did not feel like I was just falling asleep or nodding off. It literally felt like I was dying and coming back to life. I know I wasn’t actually dying, but all that was going through my mind was that my heart is stopping, and this is going to be the thing that kills me. Well, after a couple of hours of this, I start to come down, and calm down. Once I am back to reality, and can grasp the fact that I had just done to much, and was too fucked up, I apologized to the brothers, and once sober promptly left and went back home. I swore to myself I would never do something like that again, that it wasn’t worth the risk and that was that..

..3 weeks later I had a needle in my hand, and once again felt the serene pleasure of the warm evening sea rolling over my body.

I don't want to overstep, I just want to make sure she's safe, so her being secretive doesn't make me feel much better about the situation. She's also mentionned wanting to try heroin so that's something else that makes me worry a little.

The elderly. Gary will be my neighbors alias. In the late 70 s til 98 any mandolin recorded for records as a studio musician or live as the outsider hired help was gary. 3 decades of desperate attempts to popularize the mandolin. Charlie Daniels, jethro tull, Bruce Hornsby, new riders of the purple sage. If you needed a mandolin player who didn't play bluegrass, he was your guy. Now i lift up his lawn mower and fix his deck. He still thinks 5 years ago was months ago, the last run in we had. He worked the music store for his musician friend. Gary was broke and lived in a camper when single.  Now all his money is in mandolins. Even when he retired, 35 thousand dollars he spent on  One mandolin. His wife paid the mortgage, Gary still had the same paint stained tennis shoes I remember in 2006. His wife chases me away after 5pm, Gary hides his vodka,here. 3 martinis before dinner, bed at 730 She says. She doesn't want him drinking. He was barely alive in the soul when I realized he was my neighbor. His wife was my least favorite of my mother's friends. Cunt is an understatement.  So we act like teenagers irking her uptightness. I bet she only danced at her wedding.  He always asks how my hands feel, that surgery must have had a long rehabilitation and physical therapy to play like  I was never injured.  If Gary could see better or remember daily, my tracks would be blatant too him. I'm learning jazz guitar. He's learning jazzy dead songs for me.  My work causes my other scratched skin I say. We play my originals and he noodles along. He talks about touring,  how he could arrange for bringing me along. That would be a dream come true, unfortunately, Gary's main musicians all have passed. He talks about doing open Mic nights, then always says the dog needs a bath that night. Last week he assumed his kid and I grew up together. I've never met him.  Always Remembering 15 minute long arrangements without sweat, forgetting the year the next moment. Gary prioritized his memory storage.  He's off his opiates now.   So I nod along to spare him explaining again. His wife knows my mom. She thinks I'm still young. She tells on me and tells my mother I smoke weed and drink.  Gary is letting me drink.  Gary doesn't smoke,  but his fingers do on those frets. Our little jam sessions are smoke shows, too bad no one is there too listen.  Some days I have to board the coke train to keep up.  We play any thing he can remember. His wife works up stairs doing cyber therapy sessions.  She's so rigid and uptight, we both always agree this here in the sun is bout as good as it gets. No therapy needed when u have this. That's the smirk Gary always has. That's why he doesn't need those opiates. I need his secret. Gary doesn't work or tour anymore, its been decades now. He was always the hired help. So many tour stories about wild parties and drugs mention He was left out. being married and only a drinker, not hip enough All his life he played rock and roll / country mandolin. Bluegrass is the main genre for that instrument. The masters like David grisman were so epic, He was stuck in his niche. No originals wrote, no hits.  He's damn content now that he has someone to jam with. So  my lyrics and chords are the songs.  78 and 2 months ago he had reserved to let go. could barely move. Now he's got color to him, not taking his opiates and out and about. Gary thinks I get scratched alot at work. His wife tells the truth, he doesn't buy it.  So when the sun is shining, my 80 year old best friend hangs with me on the porch. Drink martinis, we try and learn those bluegrass legends solos, play songs, and forget we both need opiates. He needs them for dieing, I need them to keep from wanting to die. Not suicidal, just not impressed. Open mics and occasional jams around the fire can't mask the taking. No giving, people take. Scum bag fiends who want something always, or girls who need attention. Jobs that are dead ends, jobs where promotions cause hostility and petty people threatened shit on you. Opiates. Keeping the monotony at bay. Here's to every one finding a 78 year old bff. He only wants me to play guitar, and pour another martini.  Its funny how a habit sets to pause on that porch, every where, and everyone else, dance for a few minutes then ask for what they need. Gary's my homie, and straight with me. ""What are ya waiting for? I'm dieng so lets get pickin"" .....I oblige him and realize I dont have a habit here on this porch.  I'm clean to him and this is all I need.

Things that help along the way.  Xanax is like gold. When you can’t sleep or when you’re just craving something it really helps. Also Constantly take 800 mg ibuprofen every 8 hours or whatever the bottle says. Drink plenty of water. If you’re into weed smoke plenty. Now this last one is going to sound a little strange but it really works for me Bc I’m the type of idiot who has to withdraw at work...(8-10 hours of lawn maintenance a day). For some strange reason or really helps me to have some dope with me. Not that I’m planning to use just to have in case I need it. It gives me peace of mind and also helps me get through the day Bc I’m not constantly thinking about the next time I’m gonna score. I know it sounds weird and it’s a lot of will power but before you know it the minutes are hours. And then you’re at lunch time. That’s where I’m at now, which I think is pretty good Bc I started trying to come off dope on Wednesday and I’ve managed to get to lunch Wednesday, lunch Thursday, and all at work today. Of course I went and scored right after work but I already bagged it all up for next week and only smoked a little to see how potent it is. Oh also for anyone wondering I snort it and occasionally smoke it to test potency when I get a new batch. I’m not sure if my method will work for shooters. Or anyone besides me really.  But... I already feel better and going through a day of manual labor in the sun while withdrawing and not using was an amazing feeling, knowing it was right there if I needed it. Every hour that went by made me feel like a stronger person. Even though I had it right there with me. I have no idea why but just the thought of having a bag with me just in case helped me tremendously. I didn’t get sick except towards 6 this evening I was yawning and eyes watering and some of the beginning signs of withdraw. But instead of using the bag I took with me to work I added it in with the new stuff for next week. And I already bagged it all up so I have to go through the next 2 days withdrawing. I hope it works. That I’ll slowly be able to withdraw with way. Let me know if you have any pointers or constructive criticisms or words of encouragement. Be safe out there y’all!

I strictly regulate my use, and have been able to for almost 10 years. If I'm using heroin, I can keep it to once every three days. If I'm using something which hangs around a bit longer (e.g. methadone), I keep it once every week. I've been able to avoid a physical addiction since I first began using in my early teens. Withdrawal was hard, but it ended after a few weeks.

I have treatment-resistant depression. I have tried almost every single psychiatric drug out there, with little help. I also suffer from periods of extreme panic attacks which can last from a few minutes to weeks or even months on end (seriously, it's hell). This has seriously derailed my life, and has cost me a significant amount in terms of relationships and my education/professional life.

When I'm high, that all goes away. I'm highly productive, I'm happy, and I'm generally a much more stable person. I have friends who are stabilised on methadone, who after many years still find it extremely effective in reducing their anxiety and depression.

I am seriously considering upping my usage in order to develop a habit from which I can then transition to a legit methadone script. Prescriptions are cheap where I live, funding this is not a problem. I figure, if it enables me to live the life I want, I can always come off it later. Withdrawals are bad, but even methadone has nothing on month long panic attacks. I know because I've experienced both.

for those who are unaware tc is a video chat platform that while not perfect, seems to work well for phones and browsers alike. this room is for hanging out, listening to music, and specifically harm reduction so no one has to use alone. it is unaffiliated with r/opiates and its moderators and has its own rules and etiquette. here are the revised and updated rules:  

1) don't do any sort of -isms, it's just not cool and i run a leftist room. your opinions are welcome but no personal attacks or nasty stuff about groups of people. if you want to be rude, get personal, there's plenty of stuff to say about people without going for low-hanging fruit.  

2) don't make obnoxious noises over the mic, or play music over the chat. the bitrate for the sound channel is like 4, everything sounds like crap unless it's played through the built-in youtube player.  

3) don't dox anyone or take pictures or record the chat, this is a place people come to feel comfortable doing various things and anything that violates privacy results in an instant ban.  

4) that's basically it, just don't be a douche.  

the room is at https://tinychat.com/room/everythingisstil  
anyone is welcome regardless of beef and personal history so long as you keep it off the table.

Unfortunately that's all he has but I'd like to be able to get something out of it, since shooting coke on its own is nowhere near as blissful. So I'll be shooting both and filtering with a micron filter. But with my suboxone use, would I get anything at all from the 40mgs oxy? What if I take a day, maybe even 2 off? Also, I've only ever used heroin in the past, and I had a monstrous tolerance, so does that change anything or is my suboxone dose really all you need to know to gauge the strength of 40 mg oxy?

Really wish I had 80 at least but how can I best make sure these don't go to waste?

I’ve been IVing MDMA crystals lately & coming down with xans. 

The rush is not as good as good coke or Dilaudid, but it’s pretty dope.

You feel it immediately, but the peak of the rush takes around 30 seconds & last’s about 10 minuets.

Much like coke, your heart stars pumping pretty hard, and you ponder if you should call 911 before you die. But around the 45 second mark, most of the anxiety goes away and you start rolling balls. Then you feel social.

The peak is short, around 45 min, but the comedown is a lot smoother than if you were to take it orally. And the high feels “cleaner”.

I’ve just been chilling watching anime with my lil bro & playing Dragon Ball FighterZ/fortnite.

I know I’m killing my veins guys, but it’s okay. I’m getting some more micron filters soon.

I had a dealer actually refuse to sell to me because I was too thin. I remember saying, ""WTF, bro. I can go over to the next block and get it."" And he said, ""Do that then, because you're not getting anything from me until you gain some weight."" I was really bad then, really skinny. Anyway, it was frustrating at the time, but in retrospect,  that was a good man. And he did not sell to me until I gained weight -- he wasn't kidding. 

A few years ago, I was talking with a friend who had been using at the same time and place as me and she told me the same story! I guess this dealer was trying to do the right thing as much as he could. 

I know of two dealers who got a third into freaking drug rehab -- she was working for them. And she got very strung out and they found her a place in a rehab.

I also had dealers who saved me from getting robbed, etc.

My spiral down hill leading to rehab...,"Yo what's good everyone ! Last year around the end of October I checked myself into rehab .... Yes willingly. I was just about fed up trying to maintain my job and at the same time trying to stay well and not go I to WD everyday, i was doing at least a ball a day of tar (IV) towards the end of my run probably the last 3 months . Had started off with the roxies (green 15's, blue 30's) 4 years ago snorted my first 30 and fell in love ... fast forward 2 years and once the oxy habit was at 300 mg a day I knew I had to go a cheaper route , my cousin told me about a dude who had fire tar and that would hook it up since he is a family friend. Took the offer and bought 2 g's of Black I knew nothing about , I knew you could smoke it or shoot it but I didn't know how. I asked my cousin to help me out and she said half nodding out "" just rip a fat chunk and throw it in a visine bottle"", "" add water half full, then drip drop it down your nose...slowly"" I was like wtf? So I tore off at least a .4 and stuffed it in the visine bottle shook it up till i had pitch black liquid , tilted the head back and HOLY FUCKING BALLSACK i just felt like I snorted a line off the devils dick! It burned so bad but after a few more drops in each nostril I was feeling warm, fuzzy , and euphoric. Nothing like the oxy but still good in its own way it got the job done and it lasted me a good while at first. Now two months go by and my nose is raw as fuck , and it's not hitting me the same anymore ( tried smoking it numerous times and almost threw up, hated the fucking burnt taste ) so I hit my cuz up and ask if she would be willing to shoot me up, she refused and said "" I promise you , you'll regret it"" and hung up. Called again this time offering her a half g and about a gram of hard i had got chunked plus cash for driving 100 miles to drop off dope. Needless to say she was at my place in 15min. The crack must have been superb because she said she heard the train lol (she shoots hard by the way how? Idk) anyway after she got right she loaded me up a .4 and had narcan on stand by she walked me through thoroughly step by step and told me she was only showing me once. She hit me right on the side of my wrist below the thumb and once she pulled back I could barely even see blood register it was so dark but when she pushed down .... it took my breath away , instant taste of vinegar followed by a pins and needles feeling that brought me to my knees ... I swear I creamed my pants a bit after lol that's how good it felt . Then shit just got out of hand from 2016 up until the end of October last year , over dosed 4 times , all times brought back by narcan. My veins in both my arms are completely shot and I have a gnarly scar where I had a bad abcess they had to slice open . My neck veins feel weird and kinda hard in some spots from shooting in my neck when I couldn't hit arms or legs...

It took me a long time to accept that I was dependant (strangely it seems my mind didn’t want to let me believe it). Once I came to know for sure I was and there was nothing I could immediately do about it I searched for a cheaper way to stay well out of economic necessity.  I really couldn’t keep buying pills and heroin (I was using both) for much longer without suffering financially.

Looking back I really wish I hadn’t been so smart and stupid at the same time because of course all I really did was kick the can down the road and make an even bigger problem -- It still has to be dealt with. I know that one gram of fentanyl lasts me about 2 months and I’m into my 6th gram now so has it been almost a whole year I’ve been stupidly kicking the can down the road? I seriously find that really hard to believe yet the math can’t be lying. I’ve come to the conclusion that however long it’s been it way too long and definitely time to do something about it. 

I never dose enough fentanyl to cause euphoria, just enough to keep me well. If one does dose enough to cause euphoria it is really very disappointing (compared to just about everything else) and you are also very close to an overdose (just a very few mcgs away) so I don’t ever go there anymore and haven’t in many months. My understanding (and experience) is that this isn’t the case with fentalogues (substances similar to fentanyl, many created to avoid the schedule of controlled substances which doesn’t help any more now there is the Fentanyl Analogues Act). I also do the same thing with other substances, like heroin and pharmaceuticals, not dosing enough to cause any euphoria but just a maintenance dose but I must admit that with heroin (and certain pharmaceuticals) it is just too tempting not to push just a little more (on some rare occasions) if one is having a particularly bad day and take a very short opioid induced vacation basking in the warm and wonderful euphoria that heroin and a few other select substances can obviously provide if you dose enough :)

My wife has no clue and with each passing day it gets less likely I’ll come through this without her finding out about it but I still hold out some small hope this will be the case and I’m really afraid it will destroy our otherwise really good marriage. I would like to try to go to NA meetings but can’t as my wife is smart and would likely line up the times I wasn’t home with the meeting dates and times :)  Also I never lie to her (obviously I don’t tell her everything) so if she ever were to ask me directly I’m pretty sure I would have to tell the truth.

I’ve done (literally) many days of research into buprenorphine maintenance therapy and I think it could be a really good fit for me. I’ve communicated with lots of people that use buprenorphine and found out a lot of information, some of it that many Doctors obviously aren’t aware of. Like for instance, I ""know"" after much research that buprenorphine won't do it for me and my stupid fentanyl addiction (many have warned me not to even try), so much so that I'm not even going to try “directly”. When the day comes (and it must come soon and really can't come soon enough) I will have to switch to something else a week (or preferably two) before trying to switch to buprenorphine. I've communicated with a good number of people who tried to switch from fentanyl to buprenorphine, even at the maximum dose many were **”very sick and confused”** as to why it wasn't working when the their Doctor told them it would but apparently it simply won't because it can't. There is something about the pharmacology of fentanyl (somehow related to the lipid solubility) that causes it to stick around for several days (even though the effect has long since worn off and the person is well into expected natural withdrawal symptoms (scoring 12 or greater on the COWS scale) and then cause **brutally more severe precipitated withdrawal** when buprenorphine is introduced. Now that the time is near and I am getting ready to turn the page on this I realize that there are still a few more very important questions I forgot to ask.

I haven't used any fentanyl in a week now as I have been doing a trial run replacing it with heroin (to ensure that my intended approach is still practical) and that has worked out. 

Even though I was using fentanyl, I have found that I can manage well on about 3.5g of ECP heroin per week. So I figure if I get about 7g of ECP heroin and use that for a full two weeks (3.5g/week max) before switching to buprenorphine I should be OK as after two weeks since I used fentanyl I won’t be switching from fentanyl to buprenorphine, rather I’ll be switching from heroin (or whatever else I can get) to buprenorphine.  At least that’s my current “plan”.

There really are no other heroin users in my area and I know this to be true because the lab that the authorities use to analyze seized drug samples has never been asked to analyse heroin samples from my area (I read their annual reports), there is just no heroin around me (except what I have from time to time and I buy it 1500 miles away in another city I travel to often) and of course there are obviously somewhere around me must be a few more secret addicts who wish to remain secret and are obviously doing a good job of it :)

So is 3.5g of ECP per week a lot?  Have you used this much and been able to switch to buprenorphine with manageable withdrawal symptoms (e.g. symptoms that could still be hidden and unnoticeable to those around you)? 

One other question also occurs to me: If I were to be unfortunate enough to end up in a severe precipitated withdrawal scenario (to spite my best efforts), can I dose one opioid or another to reverse it or would that only make it worse?

Thanks so very much!

Did I finally get a JJ moment?,"I posted a couple months or so ago asking y’alls thoughts on trying my guy’s IR morphine or sticking with his OCs because of the price differences ($3 for morphine 20, $8 for OC20).

Took the plunge and ordered both. I liked the morphine in a different way - it’s great for the pain at night, when the sedative effects are a non issue.

Last week he shipped my next order, a mix of OC20 and OC80 (price per mg much better for 80) plus 60 morphine. It was coming from overseas but was scheduled for delivery later that week. I was running low on meds, so when delivery didn’t happen as scheduled, and then tracking stopped  by end of week, I panicked. I ran out over the weekend so the last three days I’ve been battling withdrawals, trying to keep them at bay with some loperamide. 

In touch throughout, he sent me a reship using a less expensive service yesterday, Wednesday morning, and also added additional product to compensate for the reduced shipping service. I didn’t even expect that, but wow, I was already impressed. 

Then this morning I received an email that read: “Good morning HMT, it appears miracles do happen. Your original order is landing soon.”

I check tracking and it was out for delivery, and the doorbell rang about 30 minutes later. I couldn’t believe it. I’ve never had a JJ moment ever before, and thought they were elusive as hell. I was a little worried that it was all a set up, surely this was a controlled delivery. Alas, it was not.

So not only did I not have to wait any longer for my meds, but I’m also receiving a double order. I offered to pay him for the second order and he declined.

8syk7x,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8syk7x/i_need_help/,26,https://redd.it/8syk7x,phatn00gs,I need help,"to make this short and sweet, I am addicted to dope, and it's tearing me, my life, and everything I have apart. I'm only 23 years old, and can say i'm a pretty experienced user.

I've been in and out of the court system multiple times because of two DUI's and minor pot charges. Back when I was 18 or so I had got into xanax and kpins pretty bad, sniffed dope a couple times, and did all your common painkillers and shit like that. I OD's on heroin in my parents basement around this time, because I had ate a few kpins and snorted about a half gram. My friend was smart enough to get my father, and my father tried CPR on me and then called the rescue squad. This event was one of those things that just sits in the back of your mind always. My dad brings it up and reminds me of it when he's explaining how much he loves me and doesn't want to lose me, if anything ever happened to me.

I OD'd again at a friends house, and was lucky to have a friend go get narcan and hit me with that. I got pretty heavy into my dope use around 19-21 or so. I was somehow able to get off of it though. I didn't use suboxone or anything like that to help me. I was just able to stop. I really don't even know how I did it being completely honest. But here I am, a few years later. Been sniffing everyday for atleast 4-5 months... honestly, it's been alot more than that, I just hate to think about it. Probably been using daily 7-8 months now.

The worst part is, atleast to me that is, is that i've also started to bang it. It hasn't got to the point where I absolutely have to shoot it, and can't snort it, but I just never thought i'd be shooting it. I never had anything against needles or anything, I had just always snorted it and that was fine with me.

I'm tired of being like this and honestly really want to stop. I have lost probably 30 pounds, I don't hangout with alot of the people I use to because I'm embarrassed, I'm just not the same. I'm still a hardworker, and a good guy, it's not like I have turned into a scumbag or a degenerate, I'm just tired of having to get high to feel ""normal""

I've been through plenty of counseling programs and all of that type of stuff- from all the court mandated things. They were all drug treatment programs. So please don't tell me passages or something like that. I really do want to get clean, because I know for a fact that this is the worst I have ever been about using.

I have had the ability to have it everyday, but it's to the point, where I go throughout the day, making sure that I will have some when I wake up in the morning, and all that shit. I absolutely hate it. I have been thinking about the vivitrol shot, but to get the shot you have to be clean. I don't think I can go the amount of time to get clean to get the shot. The place offers a 5 day detox, but it's 7 grand. I'm going to see a subuxone doctor next thursday, and i'm sure I will get the prescription, but that's honestly not even what I wanted to do.

I honestly just want to be strong enough to go the 3-5 days of god awful withdrawls and uncomfortableness, to beat it myself- but it's so much easier said than done. This is my first post so I'm sorry for being a noob, but i've been a long time lurker, and needed somewhere to go for help...

I went to rehab almost 3 years ago and have been clean for the most part since then.  When I was using I did about 3 30mg pandas a day.  Had a huge tolerance.  I did sub strips a few times and would cut one into 8ths.  And they would. Always keep me from withdrawal.  

Recently a friend of mine went to rehab and got a bunch of strips.  He gave me one, and I proceeded to cut it into 8ths and took one sliver of it.  Needless to say I absolutely wasted from it for over a day.  I’ve managed to do it only every 4 days.  But it completely rocks me when I still have over half of the original strip from last week.  

I guess my question is, is this normal?  I know I have no tolerance anymore but aren’t these supposed be abuse proofed with naloxone?  I took 1/8th at 1pm today even now I can barely even type this post out.  It’s taken me well over 20 mins and I keep nodding out.  ",1529636371.0

Coming off a a large IV fentdope habit I can tell you that 24mg barely held me correctly for 24 hours, sometimes I needed to take the maximum dose recommended by the manufacturer; 32mg 

While 4mg of bupenorphine may squash your withdrawal from 150mg of oxycodone, it will do nothing for habits of harder opiates such as diacetylmorphine, oxymorphone, and hydromorphone.

I know exercise and a good diet help but I'm wondering about a medication. 

Like okay, I've never used steroids (testosterone) but I've done a lot of research on it and when you use steroids for a while your body stops making it naturally, so when you stop it takes a good while for your body to start again. To combat this, a lot of people take PCT (post cycle therapy) there are a few different brands, but their purpose is to make the body start making testosterone naturally again a lot faster than it would without taking any medication. 

Is there not anything like that but for dopamine? I'm not too educated on the science of drug addiction so this is probably a stupid question, but I figured I'd ask anyways. Is what I'm asking impossible to make? Are people working on making something that does this? Lol. Imagine if there was a medication that made your brain make the chemicals naturally again at normal levels within like a month or two rather than like 3-6 months (I know it varies) then you would just get through the shitty acutes and know that the PAWS wouldn't last nearly as long.

That set the scene for the first time I’d lift off. A buddy had talked me into it. Now to give you a little background I was no spring chicken to the market of chemical sedatives. I had no tried one I didn’t love. Hell, I have fond memories nodding off to Disney movies as a child when my mother had dosed me with diphenhydramine (an allergy medication). From this point on I knew it was meant to be, you and me.

  As the years went on I was mostly a reefer man. Loved the stuff. Deliciously sedating, yet creativivty-enhancing. I wrote some of my best (and first) poems thanks to the goodie-laced herb. Now as you know here in the land of the free, our laws are a little special, in the very worst way. First of all, if you smoke weed you are mostly likely in contact with some less than ironclad folks. Who to trust? Who is selling what else? Who fucking knows? Now… remember this is back in the good ole days before legalization, kids. Coming from the adult-child…

   So next comes college, where I meet my weed dealer at orientation immediately. Before school even began I was “in”. I just knew this contact would lead to many great things. Boy was I right… (and wrong). We used to smoke blunts all day while skipping class and playing video games. Ahh what a use of my parents money. “If they could see me right now”, I thought… Little did I know what I was doing then was nothing in comparison. One day I visited my dealer friend. He was a hippie of all hippies. We got tripped out on DMT and played hackey sack. We snorted pills and watched ‘Fear and Loathing’… Wait did I hear that right? 

   Yeah… that’s right. It was that quick of a transition. I had only known the sweet, seductive warm mistress as “roxy” or “rockets” at that point. They called them rockets because the lines left after smoking them, which I never tried. Seemed a waste to me of that beautiful blue powder. I would go on trying this Roxy of mine time and time again. Never abused her. I remember one day I was with her at a musical festival. Only I didn’t get into the festival with no money, and the “friends” I was with were all VIP but couldn’t do anything for me. I end up wondering around the city for hours, high off my balls, and wearing a cowboy hat for some reason (long fucking story… I still have that to this day). I only found my way home that night with a drunk man, his friend and his wife. I remember smoking literally blunt after blunt in that car on the way home to the mountains of Kentucky. It is a memory which sparkles in my mind and appears in my dreams sometimes. Was it at all real? 

   More months go by, and I’m seeing Roxy here and there. Me and here like to go out together and socialize. I had never met someone who gave me such great confidence! It felt pure and honest and surreal! I loved my trips with her, yet didn’t abuse her. I said I never would. What would be the point of dulling my intense feelings for her? Then life came. My 11 year-old best friend, my golden retriever died one day, and then my world flipped upside down.

His name was Copper, the shiny bronze medallion which he wore his fur like. He would follow me out on skate runs, and my friends and I would have to ditch him by hopping a fence somewhere. It sounds cruel in retrospect but we were just looking out for him. He had been hit before by a car on the main roads. Knocked clear from one side to the next, unhurt. Copper scurried straight home on the railroad tracks, the shortest way. I had always been a man of the tracks, once walking 14 miles on them to order pizza. Anywho, Copper was laid to rest by my own hands as well as my father’s. I remember he actually scooped him in the bucket on our new super-powered lawnmower/tractor type vehicle. He was so bloated and heavy now, maybe 15 hours after death. 

As Copper was lowered down into the sacred ground on which he was buried (the forest edge of my backyard where we played together so often as younger ones…), I felt my heart sink into my chest. This is anxiety I thought… No?! Fear..? That’s it? I was wrong. This was something much much worse: loss (something I would learn much about in the new game I was about to play). 

That game my friends was the dope one. It was a dope one alright! It was also a shitty fucking terrible game at times. I loved it. As I sat alone in my room in my rolling computer chair on the hardwood flooring, I span about in it, cursing at the air. Saying if I just had another pill right here I’d probably shoot the fucker into my veins using anything at my disposal (I didn’t IV then). Turns out I was quite broke at this time. I look around as I often do, racking up the cash value on my living space. My xbox controller I thought… Yes, this will do nicely. The pawn shop is closed but my dealer has an xbox, so who knows? He might trade. I text Benny up. 

[He’s a dense boy I’ve known since school kids. He apparently has a lot of money somehow. I think he works somewhere I’ve long since forgotten. Something with trucks? I dunno. At first I thought he was stealing the pills from his mom, but I later realized my other dealer right up the mountain from Benny was actual the supplier for him as well. Now Benny was dense and also liked me. I was a manipulative, attractive young pharmaceutical addict. I could get him to come down on prices all the time. (No, you dirty-minded creatures. No gay stuff happened there though I got that vibe) So I would go to Benny instead of Japan up the road (nickname of the good source dealer way up on the mountain) because Benny would take a loss sometimes just to make a sale to me. Weird huh? I still haven’t figured that one out. Oh did I mention Benny was dumb enough to think the cops where already onto him as a small time new dealer, so he buried his cash and pills in his yard with me watching where, mind you!

Now if Benny is Benny, then Japan is the Jets! He had some fire cocaine (well if I would even know the difference). It was my first time trying it not long before this whole dog incident. Another friend of mine, Garth, a seasoned pothead who introduced me to Japan and cocaine. Hell yeah! We often rode around in my light blue Toyota’s version of a Caddilac, slanging outdoor cheap weed in order to make enough profit for a sack of white girl and an oxy to come down with. Garth didn’t do pills but I showed him the power of an oxy on demolishing a stimulant comedown. Good influence I am. Well shit! He showed me coke!]

Okay, I ran off topic there. My apologies if I’m a shit narrator. There are just so many layers to this dope game and the stories she weaves. Where was I? Oh yes…

Benny replies to my text: “No bro I don’t take trades..”. Fuck. This means I am going to have to figure something else out. I think of all the other dealers… Japan won’t trade. He’s all business. Garth is just a user like me, always broke wanting to ride off the coattails of my money and vehicle. I can’t text either of them. Then it hits me… Something I wish never had even fucking dawned on me because it opened up a whole new rabbit hole which I couldn't climb my way out of. I became Alice on that day. 

I had been helping my family clean out a relative’s old house, who had died of cancer. I knew with cancer there is always pain meds involved, so the obsession struck me to search. It was my duty then and there, in my broken ass, twisted mindstate after the loss of my precious friend, to find those fucking pills. I ventured upstairs, and lo and below there is a Walmart bag out of place hanging out from his side of the bed. I drag it out, empty it and like the scene from pulp fiction, an orange glow brightens my face as my gaze fixes upon the words written on all these boxes in front of me… 

This next part of the story is completely a hazy, distant memory transposed in the backdrop of my mind. To go back there I have to reach a deep meditative state, akin to the buddhist monk who lit himself on fire in protest of government. That is the state I would be in for the following months. What I had, my friends was a goldmine. I just didn’t know it yet. Fentanyl? I’ve heard of that I think. I was just a virgin to the opiod’s soft fucking at this point. Now never in my life would I have justified what I was about to do. Stealing from a dead family member?  Well.. it wasn’t pretty and it didn’t end that way either. At the time I really didn’t care. My love, my pretty golden dog had died. I was getting fucking high! I justified it with “he won’t need these anymore”. However, there’s still a ton of fucking drug left on them. 

I open up one of the boxes and pull out a translucent little patch labeled “Fentanyl 100mcg transdermal” or something of that sort. Hm… better resort to the all knowing god that is google. I quickly slide back downstairs into my room, jump on my PC and hit up Bluelight, the classic drug reference forum. They say fent is dangerous stuff and that new users should not mess with it for recreation. I don’t listen. I remember that first night I had some friends over 20 minutes after I had taken a sliver of a fent patch on my gum. We watched cartoons as I melted into my bed. This is the life I thought, and I have an infinite supply. No one will notice these years-old meds are gone. Those are an example of typical addict’s habitual nature. Hoard up the wrappers and such in case there is a small amount of medicine left in them. Well my friends, there was plenty left in these!

Its actual Panda abuse","Ive had a scripy of 90 20mgs for 8 months and have experimented with everyway possible to take this drug. It has a horrible ba orally of only 10% snorting gets it up to 45% but there is a fine line and if you snort too hard it will hust bypass your nose go injnto your stomach and then you lose so much of it, some will stick but 5he rest will just go down your throat into your stomach. The best way to do it, i get the g series which actually breaks down very well. I take the coasting off put it in the corner of a bag and crush it and then i use a razor blade and get it as fine as possible. Its worth taking your time. Then i make 3 lines and sniff very lightly to try and keep it all in your nose on the mucous membranes. Don't swallow at all and you want to avoid the drip at all costs for at least 20 minutes. Try to get your nose as clean and clear as possible first and use qtips and try to get your nose as dry as possible before snorting. Also its a little counter intuitive but eating a high fat meal right before can increase the plasma level by up to 40% even the drug company says this and warns aggainst eating an hoyr before or 2 hours after taking oxymorphone. I know this goes for taking it orally but not sure if it also goes for insufflation as Im not sure of the exact action that causes this but it cant hurt. Enjoy my friends. I walk my panda at least 3 times a day and im always looking for a new path so any insights or advice would ve great as my tolerance is fetting rediculous and i cant just take a whole lot.

Ok story time my friends. Now that im off of dope every little thing is triggering memories and one of your posts about an early phone call from the d boy did just that. About a year ago my phone rings at 3 am and its my guy. I'm all what the fuck? Answer the phone and he's in a panic speaking so fast i can almost smell the meth smoke through the phone. 
   
(Him) Hey SnowboardMore88 could you drive your truck over to my place and help me out? 
(Me) Umm maybe man what's up? 
(Him) Just come over please. I'll throw you a couple grams"" 
(Me) Yup on my way man. Now I've known this guy for about a year at this point and he only lives 15 mins away. 10 mins at this time of night because all the lights are green. On my way over i start considering just the sure absurdity of this situation. I have no idea what he wants or what i'm headed into all because the d boy dangled a couple free grams in front of me. For all i know he could be in a sleep deprived hallucination but I'm on my none the less. Sigh yup this is my life now apparently. 
 
So i pull up to his house and i can immediately see his truck is just fucked up. Which is a shame cuz he used to drive a beautiful 1960 something Chevy. His day job is working as a mechanic and he was good at it. This truck is his baby or it used to be. When i get out of my truck i realize he has parts and snap on tools spread out everywhere in his driveway and he is moving a million miles a minute in that special way only a tweaker can.

 
(Me) What's going on man? 
(Him) So I was driving home a little drunk and i had some shit on me. Turned a corner and some drunk old lady fucking smashed into my car.
(M) Holy shit dude. Are you ok? Was she ok?
(H) Yeah no one was hurt. First thing i did was make sure she wasn't hurt. Then i used her phone to call the cops. Then i fucking bounced and now here i am. 
(M) So what am i doing here? 
(H) Well here's my plan. I know you used to work on cars. So i figure we can get my bumper, fender, and radiator, belt and pulleys all replaced tonight. Because I aleady had extras lying around. Then. We can load the old ones in your truck. And i need you to go scrap em first thing in the morning while i spray paint my truck primer. And i should be good. 
(M) You think we can get this all done tonight? 
(H) Absolutely. Also you wanna hit this? and holds up his meth pipe Its take me a second to sort of process it all. I know this cant be legal but all my junky brain is thinking at this point is ""I should ask for more"" So i blurt out. 
(M) I'm gonna need more than two grams man 
(H) Ok how about 5 grams and you can keep the money from scrapping my old truck parts 
(M) Done. Hand me that pipe bud let's do
This. 

And god damn if we didn't get that whole job done before the sun started coming up around 6 30. Driving home in my truck with my bed full of parts in the morning i was just overcome with a fit of laughter at how ridiculous the whole night had been. And as far as i know no one ever showed up looking for him or his truck. So we really did all that work for nothing. But that was fine with me and my 5 grams i made out like a bandit.",1529597036.0
8st2js,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8st2js/gratitude/,9,https://redd.it/8st2js,atalossforwords00,Gratitude,"Its been a long time since I shot heroin, nearly 2 years now. I have been on suboxone for 5. The last few years I have been on methamphetamine which is a whole other type of misery but is mostly a lot easier to manage and deal with overdoses, withdrawal, etc. The rush is just as good tho as long as you can hit properly.

The point of my post is to let you know this community did a lot for me back in those days, 2013-2016. I met people online that helped me go from sick to well with not only a new middle man but often times a friend who not only sympathized with me but empatized. I have met maybe 6 or 7 people from online communities and they were always really solid people. Never once was I robbed. Never once were bags opened in major cities and skimmed off the top. No one gave me a short bag of tar out west. All the while I am suffering the disease of addiction, I had all of you in r/opiates. There was a guy in Tucson that i never met up with, who checked on me for an entire year to make sure I was okay. His name was Joe, last i heard from him was maybe 6 months ago. Never even met the guy in person. I was a Suicidal wreck for basically all my life, but there has never been a shortage of people who inspire enough hope in me for me to be able to see tomorrow. And some of those people are here in r/opiates

Your stories of copping, the dope porn, the harm reduction, the people around here who were well known back then, all gave me hope when I thought i had none. You guys were junkies but Jesus the compassion was enormous. And it was too often that a memeber stopped posting, sometimes someone on r/opiates knew the member who'd stopped posting in person, and was able to confirm their tradgic end. Its too often that some of us fell out, nodded out and never woke again. 


Whatever happens, this community has been positive. We enable each other's addiction because its fun for an addict to finally be treated like a human when we are seen as the scum of the earth. That's true. But the harm reduction alone and the overdose saves from Tracey's narcan alone is amazing. 

Thank you guys. I appreciate all this subreddit has done for me. Today I'm sitting in a VA clinic in Florida in a long sleeve shirt because my addiction the last too months too me to a dark place where i couldn't hit veins and essentially have been skin popping meth. My body is altered forever and will be scarred. To think 2 months ago i could wear short sleeves blows my mind. What has happened now is a nightmare. Maybe ill post some photos. Idk. Some dude from my algebra class just sat down next too me at the VA. I thought he was a straight edge guy but he has major depression, just tried to kill himself but is always smiling. So I better see what wisdom this son of a bitch has because i bet he is a lot like us. And we are often a crafty bunch. 

In the meantime, I hope this subreddit flourishes and is still as strong in someone's life as it was to me in my opioid days.


Edit: apparently i am really infected with something. Shooting dope and being unclean about it is no joke. I had to sign a release to cover the clinics ass when i left. Pulse was 130 and they wanted me to go by ambulance to a nearby emergency department for IV antibiotics and then up to the VA hospital 2 hours away. Its not good. I instead am ubering home to better hide my stash. No drug use today. Gonna just rest up and hit an ER in the Morning. Its not good at all. I feel so sick from this addiction. And I'm not ready to get clean. I know when I am gonna relapse before it happens. My heart is not in recovery. It just isnt. If I try it'll be months of misery with a huge disappointment for my family a few months later. Fuck it tho.",1529596977.0

I was thinking of going on suboxone treatment/maintnence, but I don't know what the requirements are. There's only 1 doctor even remotely close to me that accepts my insurance. I don't want to show up to the doctors office, him think I'm not qualified or not trust me with it, and be denied cutting off any chance in the future.

So what are the requirements for suboxone therapy? I've been told somethings not from doctors but others.

I hear one is that that you must be actively withdrawing (mildly)

I was told that you also had to have been an IV user for a certain amount of years

I was also told that you must test positive for opiates at a high threshold.

Right now I've been clean for 2 weeks now, and am not experiencing physical withdrawals, and I shouldn't have anything in my system, but honestly I know there's a big chance I will relapse after enough time goes by.

Ive gone through clean periods for a certain amount of time even months, but I always relapse, so I think suboxone maintenance is a good idea. So what should I tell the doctor? Should I forget about it know and make an appointment if I relapse, while its still in my system,? But honestly that rule (if it is one) sounds stupid, because if I relapse I doubt I'll even be willing to go on suboxone unless I can't get dope. Could someone tell me what the requirements are.",1529590709.0
8ss9ba,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8ss9ba/im_freaking_out_please_advise_regarding_drug_test/,7,https://redd.it/8ss9ba,MostcheekyH,I'm freaking out. Please Advise Regarding Drug Test on Suboxone.,"So I got referred to an addiction specialist a few weeks ago after seeking help for my heroin addiction. I'm in Australia, he started me on suboxone and down here we go to a pharmacy of our selection to be dispensed daily. In his first appointment he did very briefly mention to avoid benzos while on suboxone.

Now I understand that there is *technically* a risk of combining benzos with suboxone; but this risk is frankly negligible as suboxone has a high degree of safety. I also have an anxiety disorder (acute, diagnosed and documented) of which I still have some Xanax that I was given in my acute anxiety episode early 2017. I do occasionally take some Xanax; entirely reasonably, in times of high anxiety. I've had a lot of stress lately and anxiety has been high, been on the same dose of sub for weeks and any risk in using xanax therapeutically as-needed is frankly negligible n this context.

Two days before my appointment with addiction specialist today I used some xan (around 3mg~) over the course of two difficult days (this rough period culminated with finals on those days).

I saw my addiction doctor; talked about how I was going, mentioned anxiety (but not that I had PRN'd xanax; just didn't occur to me). We decided to up my suboxone to 8mg and also send me on my way with a urine analysis that I conducted immediately. It was a U-D-S.

I realized just afterwards how I may have fucked up.

**So my screen is definitely going to pop for xanax.**

**Now I smoked a really moderate amount of marijuana a few days before that as well; so I'm probably going to pop for bud too, though I'm not really worried about that**.

But essentially I've realised that because of the *technical* risk of dangerous (even though realistically improbable) interactions between suboxone and xanax; **what if he cuts my suboxone. Fuck FUCK FUCKKK. I'm really afraid. He's a nice doc; he knows my psychiatrist who has followed me for years, I'm going to call him tomorrow and explain this (as well as my anxieties) to him.**

I've read anecdotal reports of people being fine after popping for benzos and just having a chat with the doc (and maybe more frequent urine examinations). I've also read horror stories of people being cut off straight up.

I'm really scared. I can't just cold turkey off this, what if he tapers me? I'm gonna end up fucking relapse, fuckfuckfuck. I'm telling myself its unlikely I'm going to get shafted but I'm just really worried. The suboxone has allowed me to start properly getting my life back and now I might have fucked it. Fuck me why am I such a god damn piece of shit who cant do anything right.

If any of you have any advise/experiences please let me know, anything will help at this point. I'm really worked up even though it might be totally fine, but eurghhh. I mean, parents are even aware of my PRN benzo use; which is very uncommon, I wasn't at any point even told I would be tested and it was never stated that a possibility of failing urines could affect my suboxone therapy. Not once. This test kinda came out of nowhere. I'm 100% willing to be tested twice a freakin day indefinitely, if I show my motivation for this possibility could it help my cause? The possibility of being cut off is frightening me greatly and I hate myself for having potentially caused this.

Curious if anyone has an experience similar to mine.

I’ve been on bupe maintenance since about November now, and with a few notable exceptions I have been clean.  

Nevertheless, my habit never got too out of control for too long, not to downplay it.  I found myself using dope daily for a short period of time and with my history of going back to it now and again over the years I saw myself looking down a dark road - and decided to seek treatment.  When this occurred my incredibly innocent girlfriend was out of the country and I confided with a few close friends with what had happened.

One of whom was particularly receptive and told me to reach out if I needed anyone to talk to.  One of my best friends.

Anyways months pass.  And due to life this friend and I didn’t get to see each other as often as we normally did.  Until a couple months back, when he invited me to dinner.  We went out for steaks, something I could not afford at the time (I have a good job that pays well, but recently bought a condo and gut renovated it).  I had a couple glasses of wine and an ENORMOUS tomahawk steak, as we chatted and caught up.  Afterwards we met his girlfriend to walk around the town after a cup of coffee.

Now before I tell the next part of the story there are two distinct and important facts I need to divulge.  The first is that I have always had severe anxiety, for which I am prescribed Xanax.  The second is I left my old rental when I bought my new apartment and the gents I shared that apartment with were my friends since freshman year of college (2006).  They screwed me out of about 2 grand (between utilities and deciding not to pay me my security deposit back.  After a while of back and forth upon my moving, I decided I had two choices - small claims court or to cut them out of my lives and take the 2k life lesson.  Either way I had to be all in on the decision, and be comfortable with it forever there after.  I chose the latter.

Now we rounded a corner and though I did not see those two old roommates happen to be outside a local bar smoking cigs.  My friend and his girlfriend calmly whisked me away around the corner, afraid of how I may react.  After they did I calmly told them about the decision I made and how I had come to peace with it.  The reality of the situation though was much different, my anxiety spiked.  I began to have mini panic attacks that plateaued into a stream of non-stop anxiety.  I’m sure many others have anxiety related disorders in this board, and can relate.. but unless I am exhibiting visible symptoms I tend to keep it to myself until I can treat it properly. 

When we got back to my friends apartment I dipped to the bathroom to snort a Xanax (2mg’s in total on two separate occasions, to deal with this.  (The nasal fixation has been something that’s always stuck around).

And I don’t know if it was the $120 tomahawk steak, the wine, the pending feeling of dread or the Xanax... but I eventually closed my eyes on my friends couch for a few minutes.

I left, and time passed.  Like any best friend I made sure to keep contact at least twice a week.  Until all of a sudden the responses stopped coming.  That is until last night:

“Listen man, I've been keeping my space for personal reasons. Don't appreciate you messaging (redacted) and having him check in on me. You fell asleep in my house last time you were here and weren't yourself, I don't think you really realize that. You got some stuff to sort out and I got a lot of shit on my plate. Nothing personal but just chill out with the messages and having other people check in on me, that shits not cool. I just need some space. “

To be fair I never asked anyone to check in on him.  Simply asked friends if he changed his number.  Now one of the people I was closest to in this world wanted nothing to do with me, because he was convinced I relapsed in his company.   I explained, to no avail... nor do I expect a response from my rebuttal and explanation.  But am absolutely crushed to lose someone, especially someone I used to be inseparable from.  

I thought you hurt people and lost friends and family when you used, not when you get clean.  Don’t mean to rant but I’ve never had my use or lack thereof have such a profound effect on my life to date.  I’m absolutely crushed.  And there is nothing I can do or say to remedy the situation. 

Thanks for listening. ",1529590913.0

I can't afford $70 a day.... but I have a lifetime supply of Subs at my disposal because I went to buy 3 sublingual 8mg films and the pharmacy accidentally gave me 3 BOXES of 30 sublingual 8mg films, so i have 90 films lol. That and unlimited xans and klons at my disposal, I hope to god I can make a relatively painless transition... I need to be able to function... once i actually induct subs, I'm able to taper off them relatively easily... check out my post about how I inducted on an airplane...

Bear in mind this has to be big enough for all my shit, but not so big it stands out TOO much. It should fit in my 20L feeding tube backpack. The zipper stitches ripped off mine today and my friend said if it keeps me alive past this summer he’ll get me a new one for my birthday so


Here are my choices so far: [**choice 1: Ramaka**](Toiletry Bag | Travel Toiletry Bag | Toiletry Bag for Men | Toiletries Bag | Dopp Kit Travel Case Bathroom Organizer by Ramaka Solutions | Stain Water Resistant Nylon (10.5 X 5 X 5.5 Inches) Black https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074YZYN3L/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_km3kBbCG2KQ1X) [**choice2: Coisum**](Coisum Hanging Toiletry Bag | Foldable dopp kit with 6.8L Large Capacity for men | 4 Layers Portable Waterproof Makeup Bag for Women | Travel Bathroom Organizer (Black) https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075ZPQH1G/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_dr3kBbX665E3R) [**choice3: SHIK**](Premium Hanging Toiletry Bag Travel Kit For Women And Men. SHIK Bag is Large Organizer, Waterproof, Cosmetic And Makeup Compartments, Black, Free Bonus Name Tag. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078QYGFY8/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_HC3kBbVXYY8DB) Choice 4 could be one of those Vaults boxes but I can’t find a good on to put in my backpack since the edges jut into my feeding pump edges. 


And here’s what needs to fit in it: obv my smack, crystal, ativan, kpins, and coke. A good handful of rigs for the h and meth (I reuse them so not too many), a travel size soap bottle to carry water, a little stack of alcohol wipes, my eyedrops, two tourniquets, a thick folded square of foil, a dollar and two halves of a BIC pen, a 4.5”x2.5” mirror, a little plastic box of razors, a couple bandaids, a vetwrap roll, and my liquid bleed-stop spray because I have VWD, a ziplock bag of cotton balls or q tips, two spoons, maybe my cigs, a couple lighters, m pipes (straight & bowl), my narcan, a sleeve of ondansetron, a few of my nitro and lopressor, and mints or smth to keep my tongue attached my mouth. TL:DR it’s a lot. 


Does anyone have any idea what to replace my old friend with? I’m def not married to these ideas; really I just want something that fits everything and preferably has compartments somewhere just so everything’s not jumbled together. I would think about throwing the zofran, lopressor, and eletriptan in with my backpack supplies if need be, so those aren’t really a MUST. Bonus points if it locks and it’s under $35. He’s doing me a huge favor since I’m literally selling blood fetish porn, selling my own heart medication, and stealing car parts for money so I don’t wanna ask that much of him.

8sqqxe,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8sqqxe/opioid_crisis_what_a_crock_to_destroy_lives_and/,13,https://redd.it/8sqqxe,Vintendo56,"Opioid Crisis? What a crock, to destroy lives and families just for a lie...","Of course, I am one of the victims of this horrendous lie, in fact I was in the vanguard of those whom some politician who knows me as well as I know any rich people, which is to say not at all. and then to cut off both opiate pain meds (15 years) and clonazepam (41 years) cold turkey, even when the dosage and length of the clonazepam very possibly could have been lethal and had I not gone to a psych it would have. The *clinic* felt it perfectly appropriate in abruptly discontinuing the equivalent of 120mg of Valium from a patient with a seizure history. I thank God for that at least.

The opiates presented a challenge. I quit those after cutting to 160mg Oxy and it darned near took me out! That does not even take into account how the daily grinding pain from post-chemo systemic disorders, along with the original multiple trauma's that cause pain so severe there are times I can't even shower myself, and as the months roll on (clean 8 months now) I am beginning to have cascading systems failure.

The impact on my life has turned into something you wouldn't force on a sick pet. I've deteriorated from an award winning humor columnist, author, musician, artist, potter, public speaker and seminar speaker as well as a high mountain river Steelhead fisherman, to a phobic recluse who can't sit, stand or walk well enough to do anything like that due to traumatic brain injury, anxiety and serious permanent neck, back, and leg pain. Every person I knew and know has aid my personality has changed rom a motivated, crazy lunatic who loved people and places to an agoraphobic who cant call, and has dropped out of sight. From everyone. I have never felt right, and it is slowly worsening.

What really bothers me is the blatantly hollow lie of averting the opioid crisis. There never has been a crisis. 2016 Sessions and Co., released a staggering 61,000 opiate-related deaths. The statistics never revealed that if a person was hit by a bus, had drunk a gallon of tequila and taken a 5 mg Percocet, it would be ruled an opiate-related death. In fact of the 61,000 deaths, only 2,000 were the result of prescription opiates alone, with near a third being suicides. The other 59K were from heroin and street opiates. During the same year there were up to 90,000 deaths A DAY from 'hospital error,' yet NO mention of a crises there. The stated reason for this opiate pogrom ""rather Stalinesque"" one might say in how it was started.

The intent according to the Governor who allowed this travesty of humanity to be the pilot state, said it was because so many of the poor people were selling their prescriptions. I know, with some non-chronic pain patients, or those getting them for recreation that DOES happen. With PAIN people, especially low income, the last thing on one's mind is to sell any of a 30 day supply. When every alternative is even more expensive, lowering your pill count is ludicrous.

Once again, thank God, I was lucky. During chemo due to medical ignorance and Big Pharma kickbacks I ended up in such pain, a relatively 'pill tight"" doctor had me on 270mg methadone, 16mg Dilaudid and 30 mg standard oxy for break through. But when the DEA and other agencies started raiding both compassionate and learned doctors who know ""pain kills"" as well as any lawyers who would defend them. All lost their licenses, and 2 in each state would go to prison. Immediately all but the most courageous or foolhardy would fall in line, make patients sign 'pain contracts"" that are the very definition of contracts of adhesion which are unconscionable. But no lawyer will take a case. And you will search far and wide for a doctor who will help you, because now you're a drug seeking junky.

This has had the unintended (really?) consequences of turning people's pain-wracked Grandmothers, Grandfathers, Dads, Moms, family and friends to turn to the streets, actually becoming junkies, just in an effort to alleviate pain I can guarantee you they did not ask to have...then through inexperience become robbery targets. violent rip off victims or dead in a number of ways. As the number of deaths nearly doubled every year in the first four years, NOBODY saw a correlation? 

I don't know if this goes to the right place or not, if not I'm sorry for the long read. This is the most I can write, hope it helps.",1529576639.0

:- | -:
I only (""overdosed"") fell out once | I've experienced the horrors of narcan
I had mild withdrawals after 24 hours | I feel sick before the end of the day
My parents didn't know | My whole family knows 
I was in college | I took an LOA for rehab and didn't go back
I had an apartment | I'm sleeping on my friends couch
My veins were easy to hit | bellringers feel good but digging around in your arms does not
I thought quitting some day was possible | I think my best chance is staying on maintenance forever

---

You get the idea. Congratulations folks! Next time tell me it's going to be fun forever and maybe it'll come true.

1) don't do any sort of -isms, it's just not cool and i run a leftist room. your opinions are welcome but no personal attacks or nasty stuff about groups of people. if you want to be rude, get personal, there's plenty of stuff to say about people without going for low-hanging fruit.  

2) don't make obnoxious noises over the mic, or play music over the chat. the bitrate for the sound channel is like 4, everything sounds like crap unless it's played through the  built-in youtube player.  

3) don't dox anyone or take pictures or record the chat, this is a place people come to feel comfortable doing various things and anything that violates privacy results in an instant ban.  

4) that's basically it, just don't be a douche.

Facts:

* I went to a Jewish junky who middled for me and got a half. 

* The half tasted like cut that was in his dope once before, but this time it was overwhelming.

* The bag was fat, because it was like mostly or all seasoning.

* The middle's house smells a bit like this seasoning. Smell is linked to memory.

It is a very racist question, I know I'm walking a fine line.

The individual who sold the stuff to me is jewish, their house smells like this seasoning (memory is linked to smell) so that's why I am so specific to implicate the cooking of the culture with the smell of this dope.

I'm going to investigate now by checking my turmeric and comparing. I am disgusted by the possibility that I may snort this whole fucking thing.

I never do talk trash about him and I am well within my goddam right to be speaking ill of him right the fuck now.

Correction: I never did. Now, this is the second time. It's way more seasoning than dope. I gave him the benefit of doubt last time. This time there are no doubts.

It is definitely a Kosher seasoning. In my angst, I did speak precisely what was on my mind when writing this post.

My drug of choice is meth which I would shoot up and eventually a friend told me to try heroin so I did and I started shooting up instantly. I never did very much and would nod off but would never ever get a rush that I was told so much about so one night (around 10 p.m.) after feeling good but no rush I decided to do another shot and see if I could feel any better which I know is stupid but I was pretty depressed at that point in my life so I didn't care. I remember waking up at around midnight drenched in sweat so I moved over to my couch where there's an ac window unit and then promptly passed out. I remember hearing the sound of somebody throwing up and realized it might be me so I thought I should probably go to the bathroom and the next thing I know it's 10 in the morning and my roommate is knocking on the bathroom door asking if he can get in to get ready for class. I think I told him I was sick or something and he just went somewhere else to get ready. I guess I fell asleep after that because then I suddenly woke up and it's 4 in the afternoon. I could taste in my mouth that I had thrown up at some point and I somehow had almost no vomit on my shirt and it's mostly in the toilet but I have no recollection of actually throwing up or anything other than hearing it in the middle of the night.  
So my question is, was this an od or did I do enough to just sleep through everything that was going on? I was always under the impression that an od means you'd stop breathing and would die without medical attention but when I talked to my friend she said I had od'ed and got mad at me for doing as much as I did.",1529535621.0

I wasn’t exactly clean before that, I was abusing codeine and tramadol for 6 years up until I went to the clinic a few months ago. They gave me subuxone as opposed to subutex which worked a treat last time. That stuff drives me nuts, my doc went on holiday for two months, I’ve only been in this country for a year and they’re super strict with prescription meds so I went out and scored some gear because subuxone can go die a miserable death in hell. Doc is back Friday. 

Anyway, I was reading the top posts from the last month and read the post about the airline pilot dude who nearly got busted by security for wrapping his drugs in foil. Made me realise I’m not the only pilot out there who uses. I’m not an airline pilot, and I’m in a very different field, a much more dangerous one and am quite well known in that field but I don’t carry passengers. I never flew while high. Was taking two large doses of codeine twice a day. Never flew while I was riding out the high (I would drive to the airport though). It didn’t impair me, just gave me an almost hour long buzz. 

Do we have any more of you on here? A lot of my pilot buddies do use drugs quite lot, mostly coke, a lot of coke and I have one other pilot buddy who I know uses opiates recreationally and he’s the only one who knows I do. Starting to wonder if it is my friend in fact now... aviation is small. 

What are your guys views on that? Would you feel safe knowing that one of your airline pilots, flight instructors, airshow pilots were using opiates.

Fent gives you a decent rush, but there’s none of that typical opiate energy involved where you feel like you’re on speed (a phenomenon I’ve noticed with heavy opiate users as what draws us to them, instead of working like a depressant the complete drop in inhibition, massive bump in motivation, and overall increase of energy makes it feel more like speed - whereas when I get really good ice (smoked) it’s a very euphoric, clear, but “slow” high...where time slows down but I’m not about the clean the kitchen like I am on opiates). I bet everyone is different here but, anecdotally, I know I am not alone.

High quality dope gives a very specific type of rush...that histamine response which leads to pins and needles (and honestly is where I reach my ceiling as anymore and the pins and needles become uncomfortable - for me that’s around 4 bags of high quality ECP (stuff around New York - don’t think saying an area that is hundreds of square miles and contains well over 10 million people qualifies as sources...though let me know if if does and I’ll remove immediately).

We all know that fent has little to no legs compared to dope, but the biggest thing I notice is that subsequent doses...for me about 4-6 hours later...another shot of dope equal to my first shot I actually get a nice rush.  Nothing like the rush from being sick to high, but it’s pronounced and there.  Whereas fent does not exhibit this...it’s almost like a waste when your redosd and I try wait until I’m not feeling perfect well I get any rush at all, but my addict brain generally doesn’t allow that.

In short, I can make an equal amount (2 buns) of good dope last twice as long as 2 buns of fent.

Is volumetric dosed fent more dangerous than snorting powder heroin? I don't try to get very high, so I'm not inclined to intentionally push the limit on safe dosing... I'm just taking enough to feel decent when I dose. I'm considering switching from h to furanyl fentanyl since it's much cheaper. 

Are there risks that I'm missing in my thinking?  I thought the two big risks of fentanyl are when doing powder (risky eyeballing instead of volumetric dosing) and also when doing intentionally high doses because the euphoria is weak so people take too much to try to get euphoria?

So, 5 years ago I met this girl that I really got along with. We were super similar, two peas in a pod. Inseparable, spent all our time together and had nothing but fun and easy living. 

I come from a middle class family, w strong family ties. She has a meth fueled biker army as a family and I never held it against her and was always on good terms with them. 

Jump forward 2 years and she started wanting to do tar with me. I obliged. We got on the ride to disasterville, and before I knew it we were deep into fentalogs. It didn't affect me negatively, but she was declining health wise and mind wise all the time more and more. 

After 3 years and constantly being attentive to her over doses trying to monitor her breathing 24:7, have narcane handy and keep a good grip mentally on cpr, I finally had to lock up the dope in my gunsafe because she'd be stealing from my stash when I finally got sleep. 

This worked for a while but not long. Finally the sleep deprivation took its toll on me, and I slept until 12:30pm on one faithful Easter. 

I woke up to find her blue on the floor, completely cold w my gunsafe pried open and foil in her death grip and a tooter in her hair. 

My father and I tried our best to revive her to no avail. Had to call the ambulance. Again. This time was the third time in 2 months I had to call for her. And this time they all knew us by name and what the issue was. 

To make a long story short, she's alive and ""well"" but has suffered serious nervous system damage in her brain. It's almost like a stroke ( I think) it affects her motor skills and speech severely. 

So we no longer live together at this point because I'm kicking tetrahydro fu-f cold turkey and it was a bitch. So I couldn't physically care for an invalid whether I wanted to or not. And I did, very much. 

So she moved in with the meth fueled biker army, and they do alright to take care of her in all honesty. As good as a tweaker can I suppose. 

So I see her about once a week, because I hate going to the mobile home she's at due to the violence against white people there I am not exactly welcome you could say. Nonetheless, I make sure to speak with her often and see her when I can.

Now we're all caught up till about last week. 

She invites me over to meet her gay friend of 10 years, and I agree. He's annoying as hell but I ignore him and am just happy to spend time with my lady. But when I arrived the pair was wasted drunk, and since I was there her gma (let's call her D) puts me in charge of the mobile home while she is gone. I accept. Then her and her friend decide to steal Ds meth, and I don't put up a fuss about it. It's hard to understand her as it is, then add the liquor to the stroke jargon it's truly impossible for me to grasp anything she says the first few times. 

So we all get high and have a nice night overall. 10pm comes along and I leave after making sure she was tucked into bed. 

The next morning I wake up to my phone being blown the fuck up by D, and she tells me my lady's gay friend said I broke her Windows in to steal her meth and eveything that happened to her granddaughter is my fault. Like I put a gun to her head and made her steal my drugs just to flip my life upside down. 

I'm not happy about this, and we get into a serious argument over the phone. It doesn't go well. I end up deciding that war with the biker army isn't worth the trouble considering my lady is not the same person at all since the od. She acts like a 12yo, always sarcastic and rude. Always bitchy. So I tell her I love her more than the moon and stars but she really put me between a rock and a hard place. 

Now, we're at today. Up until today for the past week I have kept in contact with her for fear of her doing something awful to herself (suicide in some manner). But today she hits me up and sends me a bunch of pictures of this dude she wants to fuck and how much he loves her and blahblahblah. 

I was very offended by this. I always treated her well, and that's something I haven't been keen on as far women go in my past. 

The disrespect is fucking me up rn. 

So I wish her the best and tell her I'll always love her but I cannot be her friend anymore it's just too hard. 

I feel like I dodged the biggest bullet in my life and yet it still hurts like a son of bitch. 

Sorry this is so God Damn long. 

I don't expect this to be well received I just dont know where else to go and I figured this was relatable to this sub. 

To those of you who made it this far down. Thank you. I appreciate it. 

EDIT: Thank you all for your kind words, support and advice. I really can't believe the amount of awesome brothers and sisters on here who care about someone they don't know from atom.

He would like, in theory, for me to cut time out of his daily shooting up routine by mixing up shots for him in advance. This concerns me because of a few things... will it be ""shelf stable""? Is there a huge chance for extreme bacterial growth? Anything else that should concern me? He wants me to mix it all up with water in some kind of container, out of which he would draw up a shot each time he would like one.

Story/Timeline inside.","**SPOILER**: it's *un*chill

**5:45AM** - Feeling groggy and nauseated, joint pain amplified, I get up to pee and see my pupils dilated as fuck. I realize I've got just over an hour and a half before work, I half-asleep decide that that's a safe enough window and fumble for the loose suboxone films in my 7-day pill organizer. I stick 2 under my tongue and drift back off for a few minutes

**5:50AM** - The chemical-orange taste of the suboxone dissolving wakes me up again, and as I realize they're about 70% dissolved, my eyes fucking JOLT open and my heart literally palpitates/skips a beat

*""wait. NO. oh my god.* **OH MY FUCKING GOD**. *my foot isn't even tapping. i'm not even into the cold sweats—i'm probably still 6-7 hours from clean receptors.. what did I just do?""*

**6:10AM** - Pacing around and trying to convince myself that I had been sicker than I really was prior to dosing the subs, and that PWD wouldn't hit me (and if it did, it wouldn't be too hard and it would be over in time for work).

**6:25AM** - Pins and needles in my arms and legs, thin film of sweat manifests over my upper body, I lay down and throw a blanket over myself

**6:45AM** - I'm well and truly fucked. I postpone texting my boss and think back to some of these shitty stupid reddit posts I've read in the past about how PWD is more intense but only lasts an hour or so. At this point I'm still ignorantly planning/expecting to make it into work—if only feeling shitty and having to hide it.

**7:45AM** - Should have left for work 20 minutes ago, but can't get off the couch. My heart is racing, my skin is burning, I redose suboxone since I have no dope left or other opiates to take the edge off. I know the only way out is through. I text my boss that I'm sick.

The next 3 hours are spent rolling around in a restless sweaty haze. Tossing sheets off of me, and pulling them back on—replacing my knee pillow maybe 30 times (fucking thing has a life of its own). I become lucid/present again at around 11:00AM and realize I'm through the worst of it, but I still feel like this:

Hey y’all, hope your tuesdays goin alright. So my friend had a bit of an overdose over Memorial Day weekend, and I kinda sorta did the same thing in the same spot a couple days later. Paramedics were involved both times, not my first rodeo, never fun of course. I’ve had a few similar situations in the past and I’ve never had to pay for the narcan or the ambulance or the hospital or anything. Neither of us even went to an ambulance either time, but we still received “care” I guess, briefly. 

My homie got a bill, though, at his folks place in another state, for this incident. Apparently they’re saying he needs to pay a “First Responder Fee”. We’ve been trying to learn what we can about it without much luck, so I’m wondering if anyone here has experience with/knowledge about this. I haven’t got a bill (yet), really hoping I don’t get one, but I’m not feelin too hopeful there. Apparently him not being a California resident might have something to do with it, not sure how they’d pull that up though. 

I’ve OD’d and been taken to the hospital in an ambulance and I even think I received a sort of bill for that at one point with like $0 owed somehow. I got surrounded by cops with guns and forced to go to the hospital in an ambulance last year, and I never had to pay for any of that either. Apparently these fees are a city thing though, so none of that necessarily means anything in this case. I can’t even find any info on this city actually charging these fees but homie got the bill from a collection agency already so, like, I guess they do.

Luckily it seems like it won’t be anything crazy, like $150 or something. That’ll be pretty hard for me to swing in my current position but it’s doable. Really not sure what I’m gonna do if it’s like $500, my mom would def bail my ass out luckily but I really don’t wanna have to tell her her son (who’s supposedly clean on subs too fml) fuckin overdosed. Managed to hide all the others from her 😑 she doesn’t deserve to have to worry about that shit, she worries enough as it is.

Supposedly it may be possible to get these fees waived somehow as well, so I’m holding onto some hope there if I do get hit with this bill.

So I started doing about 1-5 bags of city street dope (east coast, snorted) last year. went off and on for a while. recently I started getting my shit from a garlic patch instead, and ive found myself fiending less with the higher quality.

I dont wake up anymore with insatiable cravings. its more so just a “nice to have” thing now. weird eh? maybe it was because there was fent in my old shit idk.

Caffeine is by far THE most common cut in #3, this is because it makes it easier to chase the dragon on foil. So I was wondering if when you then smoke it off of the foil, does the caffeine enter your system as well?

I ask this as I'm high right now and this is one of those highs where I have a lot of energy and I feel really productive, I've smoked a lot and sometimes, depending on what I get, it's very sedating and sometimes it's much more energising.

I know for a fact that caffeine is added to #3 so my line of thinking is that those more energetic highs are from where there's a higher caffeine content and the more sedating ones are where there's a lower caffeine content.

I'm sure in America you guys get your stuff cut with something. Do you ever notice the cuts in your highs?

Is it possible that when I'm vaporising/smoking my H, I'm also doing the same to the caffeine it's been cut with, thus giving me a caffeine high(as much as you can call caffeine a high) as well?

I looked it up and normal bic lighters can reach up to 800  degrees Celsius, though normally they float around 300-400. The vaporisation temperature of caffeine is about 200 degrees, so surely it's possible?thoughts?

EDIT: Have any of you Americans felt a difference in high which you believe to be due to a cut?

EDIT 2: This is what made me think about it - the key thing that shows you have good H is when you run it on the foil there's no residue indicating little to no cuts that can't be  vaporised, and if there's no residue, then what happens to the cuts like caffeine?",1529439476.0

We all know that part of the biggest problem with opiate addiction is that the bad effects of withdrawals don't really appear until a while after your dose - 8-12 hours or so.  BUT, when you administer your favorite opiate while you are sick in the middle of withdrawal, you are immediately healed and your body builds a bond that see's the thing that got you sick initially as the cure, the antidote.  It doesn't have the ability to actually, at a subconscious level, associate the drugs with the sickness.  Great.  But did you ever wonder why when you are relapsing on your opiates, that the effects are not as desirable or as fun?  How many times have you relapsed when you were out of the woods with opiates only to go, ""that wasn't that great..."" and then you are back into your old habits. 

Well I think I figured out why.  When you are sick, the feeling of going from completely miserable to healed and then to high is a huge jump for us.  However, if we are already clean, that jump isn't as noticeable and doesn't seem that big.  That relief while being sick feels huge.

The moral ways. Which are pretty much out the window.). Though, perhaps in textbook fashion, once I got Lower the cravings came back and I’m not a very strong person so I relapsed.

My last shot of dope was Sunday at 10PM. It’s now 11:45 AM 36+ hours later. I dosed 8mgs at 7AM after having luck at as little as 18 hours when I tried to get off last time.

I have a feeling if I call her office and plead my case (that I really want to stop, but these withdrawals are making me want to blow my brains out) she may either squeeze me in and give me some stuff to get through the worst of it. but, it probably wouldn’t be any time soon. She books weeks ahead. 

2. Use the points I have coming my way sometime this afternoon and try again tomorrow. 

3. Stick it through and just be fucking sick, because we all need to be. I’m all for a little set punishment, but my kid needs me to be useful. I need to be useful for her. Will the subs eventually work? Is there light at the end of this cold fucking tunnel?

So let me say, Hello my friends. I hope you are all good and well. Sorry for the wall of text in advance. There's a tl;dr at the bottom.

I've recently decided to get my life together and quit my addictions. So about two months ago I quit taking benzos and have been on maintenance for my opiates. The road hasn't been easy but I feel like I've come a long way. As of right now, I really have no withdrawal symptoms but over the time I've been off everything, I've developed a noticable tremor. Mainly in my hands and its gotten to a point that it's starting to affect certain aspects of my life. Even just typing this out on my phone is a little difficult. Thank god for auto-correct, right? Another thing is that tremors actually run in my family. (There's a specific name for it but I don't want to be identified) My grandfather had them and passed it on to my father. The thing is though, in most cases they don't become evident until your 40's, which is still a ways a way for me. But it technically can develop at any age. My question is do you think this may be some kind of withdrawal? I mean, other than the tremors though, I'm fine. Or do you think I may have an early onset of the disorder. Maybe activated somehow through my drug use? The main thing that's strange is how it progressed after I quit. I mean, since my late teen years I would get a slight tremor from drinking even the smallest amount of coffee or when I was really tired but before this I can't say I ever really noticed much. I know 99% of you have no idea about genetic disorders so I'm mainly asking about your experience with benzodiazepines and/or opiate withdrawal and their link to tremors. Any personal experience would be greatly appreciated.

bendernod ""did i wake you up""

me (sizzle)- "" yeah your good just tell me whats  cracking""

bendernod ""i was up all night in *locatiom removed* @heroin el chapo basketball nodding court of drugs** with these hoes dopefiends and dealers had a good night on coke and spent about $250 on just coke and one of the hoes shoots heroin into her arm with a needle. shortly after i asked  if i could buy some! She (kayla)-""yeah baby um here!"" she breaks out some black tar. i asked kayla if she i need to crush it up good because im gonna snort it"" kayla replied calmly yes and she procedded to light up some crack. so sizzle i snorted some and i was feeling real good but it was just a tease. asked Kayla for another bump she said do u have money im out. i gave her $85 and she used my phone and 4am and the dealer came and only kayla met her plug and by 5am i had some heroin. i put it on my scale on top of a $20 bill it weighed .1 so i figured she ripped me of and this would hardly get me high so i went home and  it was 6 am by now. i showerd and ate and laid in bed and figured 8 am was good enough to call you. can i come over""

sizzle- ""yeah pull up gang""

bendernod got here about 2 hours ago and showed me the heroin. reddit gang i believe my friend bought fentanyl!!  after getting the solid like heroin chunk out of the bag. it was pure white!

i explained thats fentanyl and its a good thing he showed up here so i could show him how to use it.

the whole white chunk did weigh 100mg after weighing on my scale to. 

I break bendernod of 6mg bump of this fentanyl and he snorts it up.5 minutes later bendernod feels very good he told me and gets all happy and thanks me explaining how lucky he is to have a kind friend like me and he offers me a bump. i do 12mg because i been doing east coast heroin the past week. and he does 4mg more and he starts nodding.

im glad bendernod had a good time he is still here and it was his idea for me to use reddit. if u want to ask us anything fire away we are gonna watch tv and try and get high. he is on my phone all the time because i trust him. 

questions from me and bendernod. if the reddit gang has a minute to help us out that would me nodsome!! <nod+ awesome> lol

we like any type of music. anyone have a youtube playlist they wanna share?

we have no job so we want to save as much heroin as possible. any tips. bendernod said the dealer told him to take a 20mg bump and lay down flat on back with head up quickly right after snorting a tiny bit for 30 minutes! dealer claims this will save money and promises it will seriously get us very very high if we snort h and lay down on back for 30.

thats pretty much it. we just wanna know if snorting small bumps and laying on back for 30 minutes will get us really high like the dealer saiid!

me and bendernod thank u for reading happy nods and stay high stay positive. throw out the hate and become great. stay safee

I all the sudden have access to subutex. I know tons of pple think the difference is theres no blocker in subutex which isnt true at all, its the absense of naxalone that makes them different and thats all. Isnt nax what throws you into nasty PWD? Meaning I could potentially start subutex a little earlier while still have some opiates in my system without fear of that same WD? Would be nice to start on subs without having to be full blown sick first. 

Or those that have kicked CT, how long were you physically out of commission for? Would it be better to just CT kick? If I got subs it would only be a few to rapidly taper with. Appreciate any advice. ",1529429671.0

This is from about 5 years ago.

Now, I used to have a ""friend"" named Kevin. I know it's a meme to hate on people named Kevin, but I really didn't care for this dude, and his name really is Kevin. I still hung out with him though because his mom gave him her script of K-pins and he was an alcoholic so he would share all his shitty vodka with me. When we hung out I was basically also an alcoholic. I'd occasionally have some pills or dope or something and sometimes his neighbor would sell us random opiates. It was a friendship made solely for getting completely shit faced together.

One night we were getting wasted and popping some K-pins, as usual. There may or may not have been opiates, I can't really remember; the benzos made most of these nights pretty hazy. I'm not sure exactly why we went, but we ended up going to Wal-Mart at 4am. So, I drove there completely wrecked, but surprisingly i drove fairly well from what I can recall. Luckily the store was only a 10 minute drive from Kevin's house.

We were walking through the store and I had a razor blade in my pocket for cutting up dope/oxy. This was right around the time I started banging and I know I definitely didn't have needles that night. Well, when I'm on benzos I have zero inhibitions, so I impulsively started slashing all the bicycle tires in the toy section, obviously. After I had rendered a few flat I fucked up and accidentally sliced open the palm of my hand. I started bleeding everywhere.

I immediately walked to the pharmacy, leaving a trail of blood behind like Hansel and Gretel's breadcrumbs. When I got there I opened up a pack of bandages and some medical tape then bandaged myself up to stop the bleeding. I think I just threw the opened packages on the floor and walked away.

I knew we should probably leave after that so I swung by electronics and pocketed a spool of 100 blank DVDs, for some reason. I didn't even burn DVDs anymore, instead opting to use my laptop as a media server to stream all my movies to my PS3 (now PS4). But if I'm in a store and on benzos I'm going to steal something, no matter how pointless.

We got the hell out of there and I drove back home at 5am as school buses were taking all the kids to school. We made it back safe somehow and continued drinking. I still have no idea how I didn't get arrested and I have no fucking clue why I went to Wal-Mart in the first place.

I have to wonder though what they did when they saw the blood all over the store. Of course they cleaned it up, but surely someone would have checked the security tapes, right? Oh well, just another story on my list of why I no longer take benzos recreationally. Come to think of it, i don't really drink anymore either.

Also, yes it's shitty to use when on maintenance. In my defense though, I hardly ever do it and I'm not nearly as bad as most other folks at my doctor's. If you think nobody uses drugs when they're on maintenance, you're almost cute in your naiveté.

My girlfriend had never done opioids. Then, this past weekend, she got her hands on Percocet, and she's never really done drugs. It wasn't out of being stuck up or some weird backwards view on it, she was just never really interested, and was fine with her occasional drink. She's smoked weed twice I think, and didn't like it that much.

Little background on her, she's depressed, and is diagnosed with a few anxiety disorders, one of them is OCD. I was scared of her ever trying opes because I had a feeling she'd like em way too much. More than me. Anywho, she told me she wanted to take these percs, and I even had a strong gut urge to stay away from them. I didn't want her to do them either, I didn't want the withdrawal for her, I didn't want the fiending, and turns out, this would be the third day in a row of her doing them, she just wanted to do them with me. She promised not to do them ever again afterwards, and I figured that, what the hell, its 15mg of oxycodone, last time, she doesn't have access to more, whatever, and I've fought off the fiending before, I'll do it again to be on her level.

This was my fault and my mistake. I cut her lines. I taught her how to snort it. Turns out, she was planning to take her life after I left, and this was kind of on her bucket list. She didn't because I stayed longer than I had planned, and she couldn't do it.

I feel as though if she had never met me, she would've never even known what an opioid was, or how to do it, or what it did. I feel fucking awful. I don't know what to do. I've been lurking this sub for a while, and you guys have always seemed supportive of each other. I know I'm a dumbass, I know I fucked her up, I know I shouldn't have done it. But I did it all anyways. How do I stop? Does this fiending shit ever end? How do I help her?

I've suffered from treatment-resistant depression for over half of my life. (I'm 30 years old.) Since I was 24, I've taken many different anti-depressants including nearly all the SSRIs, SNRIs, Remeron (mirtazipine), Wellbutrin, pramipexole, and even an MAOI, Nardil (phenelzine). None of these worked. I stuck with 30mg of Remeron because it at least helped me sleep.

I had my wisdom teeth removed at 25. My dentist gave me a prescription for Percocet. This totally eliminated my depression and anxiety. I knew about the risks of addiction, but I quickly ran out of the Percs before any physical or mental addiction was able to take hold.

I started using a small amount of kratom to aid in the withdrawal from Percocets that I was on for 9 months. Then, sure enough, I found an excuse to use kratom all the time. After a year of it, I quit it cold turkey and the withdrawal was almost as difficult.

So now I'm clean and have been for months. I don't drink alcohol or any sugary drinks. I don't smoke. I exercise a lot. I get some sunlight every day. I eat well (lots of salads, nuts & seeds, chicken, and fish). I take all of the recommended supplements, including tyrosine in the morning, a good multivitamin, niacin, vitamin d, biotin, 5-HTP & GABA, LOTS of high EPA fish oil, zinc, magnesium, and melatonin at night, but I'm still depressed, anxious, and deeply anhedonic. The anhedonia in particular is killing me - nothing seems interesting to me. I know that it takes months to feel better after drug abuse, but it has already been several months and I'm not feeling any better.

So now I'm at a difficult crossroad. I started to read articles about ""Reward Deficiency Syndrome"" and think that I and many other people who don't respond to traditional antidepressants may have it. Here's a link to a good Psychology Today article explaining what this is: https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/addicted-brains/201308/when-the-thrill-is-gone-reward-deficiency-syndrome

Even though the theory still needs to be worked out, the basic idea is that, for whatever reason, my brain simply doesn't have enough dopamine D2 receptors, and, because of this, I have to supplement my brain with extra dopaminergic/endorphin-boosting drugs just in order to feel normal, otherwise nothing is enjoyable to me and is not worth pursuing. This might be why normal antidepressants just don't work on me. My issue isn't with serotonin or norepinephrine or even dopamine. My brain's reward system is just messed up.

I talked about this with my psychiatrist about this and, considering that I've been through every class of antidepressant medication, she is seriously considering putting me on an ultra low dose of Suboxone (buprenorphine/naloxone), even though this is controversial in psychiatry. When I say ultra low dose, I mean .5mg of Suboxone. The smallest dose of Suboxone they make is 2mg; I'd have to cut the already tiny sublingual Suboxone strip into even smaller quarters.

My psychiatrist knows about my past substance use and she is understandably very hesitant, as am I. I asked my psychiatrist if perhaps I should microdose with kratom instead and she said that while she might be supportive of the idea, kratom is likely different from batch to batch and that I might not know how to dose. With Suboxone, I'll be able to to titrate where, with kratom, I'll have a much more difficult time. So now I appeal to you guys to see what you think.

Should I take the ultra low dose Suboxone (.5mg) or should I microdose with kratom (from .25g to 1g)? Or should I do something else entirely?

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! :)",1529378837.0

Everybody hates not getting as high as desired... where he wanted to be. Especially, when the reason isn‘t the lack of the substances you want to get into your bloodstream, but more likely to the naloxone  Pharma companies added to your favourite snacks. 
 
Yes, i‘m talking about naloxone. Here is my thought on how to „kind of“ get to some kind of solution

I recently thought a lot about reducing, not quite eleminating the Nalaxon from combined medications like the well known Products containing Oxycodone and Naloxone and a relatively unknown one, since it’s more common in Germany and Belgium only - Tilidin/naloxone

As far as my research took me, oxycodone  and Tilidin are easily soluable in ethanol, while naloxone only slightly is. 
So using a quite similar way as people use to wash stuff with acetone out of their speed, it should at least be a way to significantly decrease the amount of Naloxone that was inside the perfectly crushed tablets before. 
It‘s similar to caffeine. It‘s poorly soluble in acetone, so most, but not all of it is gone after the cleaning of it 

Since naloxone becomes orally active when taken 25-35mg , that would be quite handy. 
Dosage Oxy (Targin 20/10) now is 50, to be on the safe site with the naloxone . 
Since I have a tolerance, it  does nothing for me. 
When it comes to the max. Dosage of 350-400mg  Tilidin (Extended but crushed and parachuted) due to the 28-32 mg naloxone  contained, I can’t just take more. 
First pass metabolism kills most of the naloxone orally since 97-99% won’t get into your bloodstream. 
But at 25-35 mg most people feel the rush to weaken and when reaching 35/40mg Naloxone or more, most people instantly feel plain sober. 
So here is what I found so far.., 

Solubility of oxy 

„Nearly insol in ether, water, potassium and sodium hydroxid. 

Insoluble in water; soluble in ethanol, chloroform
[Lide, D.R. CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics 86TH Edition 2005-2006. CRC Press, Taylor & Francis, Boca Raton, FL 2005, p. 3-410] **PEER REVIEWED**“

Solubility of tilidine: 

Physicochemistry
It usually comes in its hydrochloride hemihydrate salt form; in this form it is highly soluble in water, ethanol and dichloromethane and appears as a white/almost white crystalline powder.[3] Its storage is restricted by its insensitivity to light and sensitivity to degradation by oxygen, hence necessitating its storage in amber bottles and at temperatures below 30 degrees Celsius, respectively.[1][3]


And finally naloxone : 

Water Solubility Soluble in water (73 mg/ml), ethanol (3.3 mg/ml), methanol (50 mg/ml) and dimethyl sulfoxide (73 mg/ml). Insoluble in ether

My question is, how realistic my thought of just reducing the naloxone in the formula simply by using a small but not too tiny amount of ethanol  to solve the Tilidin or oxy in it while just some of the naloxone will be solved in it, run it through a coffee Filter and let it dry. 
Maybe repeat once or twice. 

Besides, I assume the ethanol should be as dry as it has to be when it comes to washing amphetamines with dry acetone, right? Same procedure to dry it? 

I won’t get rid of all the naloxone, but even half of it would allow me to double my dose, so I can actually get the nice active Rush from the Tilidin or make use of all the 20/10 oxy/naloxone that are widely available in my area,  means I‘m aware there won’t be snorting or anything else. Just the good ol‘ swallowing pils 

Thanks if you read until now.

So it all started a few years ago. It began with a prescription of clonazepam. I realized that I could have fun if I took a few more than prescribed.

Then I realized if i smoke some weed while high on clonazepam it was really fun. 

~Fast forward through the psychedelic experimentation phase~ 

It didn’t take long for me to get my hands on hydrocodone. I had heard and read about the high, and I decided I wanted to try it. So I downed a few 5/325 hydros and I was on top of the world. I had no real connect to get pills from, so hydros were a rare but welcomed commodity. But I loved the way they felt. It was the one drug that I didn’t need to also have weed to enjoy. 

I continued to mostly smoke weed, and occasionally try other substances, mdma, shrooms, Xanax, you name it. 

One day I make friend with these two guys. Well call them Fred, and Robert. Fred was a pretty straight edge guy. Had smoked weed, done acid once, nothing crazy. Robert on the other hand had two brothers who sold cocaine up in the city that we lived near. So he had a bit more experience. Well once I became good friends with these guys, I decided I wanted to try coke. So we drove up to his brothers place and had a badass coke fueled night. 

Well, these brothers sold cocaine, but they also enjoyed heroin. They didn’t do it often, and didn’t seem like junkies, but they had access to it, and like a dumbass I decided I wanted to try it.

Where I lived the highest purity shit on the streets was tar. The lower purity shit was gunpowder, basically a tiny bit of tar that was mixed with a shit load of inert powder. So I started with monkey water, snorted it, felt the heroin, but it wasn’t all that amazing. I tried it a couple times after this, also snorting, and I got really high, but didn’t see how it was so amazing and addictive..

It was all fun and games until the day I decided to buy a fresh pack of syringes from the Walmart pharmacy. Biggest mistake I ever made. That night me and Robert went up to his brothers. We got some decent quality H, not the best, but strong enough for naive dumbasses like me. So I get one of the brothers to help me shoot up, took a second for him to find my vein, but he did find it. 

I watched as the needle entered my arm, I watched as the dark red blood was registered within, and I watched as the semi-clear, dark brown liquid slowly entered my vein, and suddenly I was in heaven. It took maybe about 30 seconds before I was so fucked up I thought I was going to die. I threw my guts up, but at the same time it was the best fucking high of my entire life. I will never reach that level of ecstasy ever again in my life. It was amazing, and I was hooked... 

I will write about my story in more detail if you guys are interested, I just wanted to share some of it.

Started doing Tramadols and Tapentadols, but have fully reverted back to heroin after only one month. I started to see flashbacks of my life before getting clean last summer, and it scared me shitless. 

My girlfriend(19F) of 7 months knew about my addiction when we started dating, but I had been a couple months clean when we got together, and she has been so supportive of me and believes I am a strong person for admitting my struggles and not pitying myself. I just told her I have been hiding my relapse from her, and we had an emotional last night, but it was out of care for each other, not anger. She promised me she will always be there for me, as long as I trust her enough to tell her anything.

I decided to fix my addiction temporarily because I am swamped with full time work and online classes. Went to a methadone clinic for the first time ever and got a 40mg dose. I feel happy and motivated, but fuck me this methadone feels like a long acting heroin peak. I feel like I enoy this stuff a little too much, but this will only be a temporary fix until I can clear my schedule for outpatient support. 

My girlfriend and I will go to NA meetings every Wednesday, start going back to church, and she is going to stop doing drugs along with me(she does alcohol valium and hexen occasionally). It's always a big help when you can work with someone through an addiction phase. The MMP(Methadone Maintenance Program) has alleviated any cravings for pain, but I feel like this could become my new dope habit if I stay on it for too long, so I am going to keep doing this program for only 4 months, enough to get me to have more free time to go to a treatment program and taper the methadone. Maybe I don't even need to go if the program is successful in stability, then tapering.

This is my first time doing methadone programs. Does anyone have any warnings about this stuff? I know there is a lot of negative stigma and unwarranted suspicion about methadone, but it is still an opiate, so the stigma has some truth to it possibly. I don;t want to be a lifetime methadone addict if possible.",1529344582.0

All in all, I think it was a necessary experience. It made me feel like the best version of myself - confident, anarchistic, laid back, and in a constant state of relief. 

But it also brought me down to my knees - luckily I wasn’t doing it for long or else I think personally it’d be inevitable that I’d end up in jail or OD’d. It was just too sweet, there’s not much I wouldn’t have done for that fix.

I decided to quit after seeing how disgusting my track marks looked and how much money I wasted yet still being sick a few days out of the month. I’m glad I got out of it. It’s consuming in such a perplexing way - where you don’t realize your soul’s depleting and you aren’t that “perfect self” it gave you the illusion of being. Matter of fact, in my reflections I’m realizing that those traits have been mine with or without dope. 

Regardless, it was definitely all it’s hyped up to be - especially speedballing. And my thirsty curiosity for such a potent high has been quenched. At 22 years old, I’ve had the opportunity to try every notable drug (not many research chems) and feel like the experiences were interesting and powerful enough to allow me to stay sober until I’m old albeit some weed of course.",1529336812.0

It isnt working.,"Today is 27 days clean from opiates and that's huge for me. Yesterday I threw always my relaspe stash of 2 press Roxie's and half of yellow opana because I knew I didn't think I was going to this time and it felt like that little league home run I never hit. 
Everytime I have tried to stop I always kept some for when I knew I would ''need'' it. Stupid I know.

I have fallen into a phenibut, baclofen, gaba, Xanax and wine person ever since I have quit taking opiates. Being completely sober isn't what I want in life right now but that is a pretty good combo to still be functional as long as the Xanax dose isnt above 2mg. Of course none of this is healthy to take all at once but that isn't what I'm going for and that wasn't the main reason I quit taking opates. I'm just trying to get threw life a little less high. Life may be more hazy but I'm less high for sure. The plan is the slowly get off these substances and maybe lower the Xanax and wine usage some.
 
Everything is fent or really expensive if it's real in NW Florida and it's bullshit doing 3 pharma 30s and not getting well from them because of the fake roxy habbit. I've never really done dope consistently because I hate going threw people to get shit and alot of our shit looks like grey and is so inconsistent sometimes you need narcan, sometimes you can snort a half gram and be sick. I'm sure it's just the junkies I know the their dope is shit and presses blow it out of the water. 
But...

What is your favorite non-opiate related med?
What do you use daily?

Also do you find it hard to not take opiates while not being sober from other substances or easier because at least you are doing something?

And will the using dreams ever stop? Fuck.. almost every dream I find a huge bag of assorted pills but I can never do them or break them down or anything before I wake up. That shit is stressful. 

I also am interested in tianeptine because I have a fucked up arm and I can't really grip or lift anything over 15lbs and the amount of nsaids im taking with the wine is destroying my ulcer and chrons disease which I never noticed really before like I do now. Using wine as a pain killer isn't really working as well as I hoped.   I know tianeptine is technically an antidepressant but it also apparently kills pain slightly and that's all I'm looking for. I also don't know if taking this will make me crave opiates more than I already do. Part of me thinks I shouldn't add anything to the gaba mixture. 

I tired to talk to a sub Dr almost a month ago and since I wasn't using at the time and was 4 days clean I didn't qualify. I was told this program since it is on the cheaper side only takes people in withdrawals or using so that is out of the question as of right now. 

Part of me want to go back to my old Dr and get the 90 15mg oxys back but i know they will only last 4 or 5 days and I'll be right back where I was a month ago. 

Trying to not take opiates while physically fucked is tough and I know it will be extremely metally tough if I tried it sober. 

I never do uppers but apparently it has made me talkative today. ",1529334758.0

I feel for myself- whenever I use opiates my mind is clear and I can focus a lot better on the task at hand. Whenever I’m sober, of course I have the same capabilities, but I find myself struggling to focus on what is currently in front of me.

I’ve tried Adderall and other adhd medications but I’ve had no luck with them. Whenever I’m on opiates I can get shit done; tedious tasks where I’d otherwise lack motivation to complete. I understand I could most likely train myself to achieve this same level of productivity without the opiates but I’ve found they really aid me in doing so.

My job is extremely boring, without giving out tmi, the people I work with are on avg 30 years older than me and they tell me I’m literally the youngest man in the city doing what I do. I’ve stayed high throughout the entirety of my employment here and I’ve discovered that the few times I’ve sobered up my productivity has hit a steep decline.

I may no be using the right words to describe exactly what I mean but does anyone understand what I’m saying or feel the same way?


EDIT: despite popular opinion I feel the need to clarify to you all that I am not saying this to brag. I was looking to see if anyone here felt the same. When I’m sober I feel alone. I’m 27 years old and I’m reaching my mental prime. I feel so fucking aware of everything when I’m sober; sometimes paralyzed with the anxiety from everything that I see.

I reacted out of anger that everyone was attacking me. I’m not fucking saying this shit to be against y’all. I’m with y’all. I was just looking for someone who could understand what it’s like. The opiates give me clarity because they dull my mind. I don’t want to see everything that I see. Regardless of whether you’re “religious” or not, I know this is for a reason.

I don’t care who thinks I’m a genius I just used the word to get the attention of someone who can relate to this. I know there are other highly intelligent people out there who use drugs and I wanted to speak with them. This is nothing against someone of average or lesser intelligence.

EDIT 2: throughout my years of drug use (13 years) I’ve sobered up for long periods of time at a time; sometimes even years. When I was sober I never felt like myself. Often times I would go weeks (literally) without sleeping. This lead me to feel fucking insane and angry all the time because I couldn’t focus on my work. When I started using opiates I was finally able to get some fucking work done. This is what I really mean.

EDIT 3: By genius I don’t mean an astrophysicist or even someone proficient in calculus. An example of what I mean is- take a look at rapper 6ix9ine. Someone with a narrow mind may say “he’s an idiot, he’s bad for the youth”, etc., etc. but if you look at him from a different lenses you can see that the character itself (of 6ix9ine) is genius. Rap has been the same for as long as rap has been around but this new generation is changing it. The guy colors his hair rainbow- for attention, says crazy things- for attention and then people check out his music (which actually grows on you.)

During my addiction, I ruined relationships with not only my friends but with my community at large due to the ripple effects of heroin addiction stigma.  About half of my good friends, one by one, got into dope, and the other half stayed away and stopped speaking to the ones who started using.  The users very quickly stopped speaking to one another.

Fives years gone, two are clean, two are dead, one is still using and no one is talking to one another.  Our good buddy and one of my best friends passed of an overdose this past Spring.  I did not feel it was my place to go to the funeral... his family hates us.  None of the other users and none of the other clean folk went either.  And so I mourned in my apartment by myself, to my friend's life and to all the wasted years.

And it's two months after the fact and I still can't get over it.  Even though we all kind of hate one another, I just want to get together with my childhood friends and laugh and toast our dead buddy for one last time.

8rwey5,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8rwey5/story_time_pure_alprazolam_powder_from/,13,https://redd.it/8rwey5,Aspecpro,Story time!! (Pure alprazolam powder from Czechoslovakia + Heroin),"      So here's a crazy story that happened in my past. I'm flowing on suboxone, gabapentin and phenibut , and feel like writing out a true tale from my past. 

      I was around 20 years old. I was living for the moment, free of anxiety of consequence. It just happens when you're younger and on drugs. I had recently acquired a job working at a deli in a supermarket in my area. 

    The night before, I was at a friend's place that was about a 30 minute drive from my house. He had just bought pure alprazolam powder from the DN, and let me tell you this shit was real. I remember insufflating a very tiny line, maybe a couple of grains of salt, and feeling barred out the night before. I bought some of his powder and drove home and got home around 11PM to midnight.  (Warning: operating a vehicle under the influence of benzodiazepines is NOT recommended and I don't condone it!) I don't really know how much I bought in terms of weight, because I didn't and still don't own a miligram scale. 

        Fast forward to the next morning. The time is around 8AM. I don't remember going to sleep, but I do remember waking up and feeling VERY good and free. With work coming up in about an hour or so, I came up with the great idea to snort more alprazolam before work, ya know, just to insure I have a great day! I actually snorted the entire content of the bag, which was still a small line about the size of the cotton tip of a Q-tip. It might've been around 8mg to 10mg. 

           I get to work at around 9:30 and I'm a fucking mess lol. I remember I was dropping rotisserie chickens in their case on the ground, picking them back up, and putting them back on the rotisserie lol. So after fucking up for a bit, I decide to quit the job. Right on the spot, I walked up to the manager fearlessly as fuck, and told her I had another job on the line, and that I'm done working there, see ya, bye. She was pissed, but I walked out.

             I decided that now that I was free of that bitch ass job, it was time to get high and get some dope and spend the rest of the day blissed the fuck out. The time is around 11AM. But wait, I don't have any money. Hmmmm.....I KNOW! I'll go into the parking lot of the store that I just quit, and ask their customers for money. Great idea! But first I need a plan, what should I tell them to get their money? I decided it would be best to stay in my work outfit, and tell people I just got laid off from the job, and needed some money for gas to get home, because this store was so evil that they left me on the street with nowhere to go and no money. I kept this gig up until I made $55. Yes, i made $55 in about 30 minutes doing this. 

             Of course, this was making a scene though. Some customers went in and told the manager what I was doing in the parking lot, which got him kind of pissed. So, I WENT BACK IN THE FUCKING STORE AND WALKED TO THE CUSTOMER SERVICE STATION, ASKED FOR THE PHONE TO CALL MY DOPEMAN, AND STARTED COUNTING ALL THE $1S AND $5S I COLLECTED FROM THEIR CUSTOMERS. The dopeman said he'd meet me in the parking lot at the store (I left out the situation and ruckus I just caused in the parking lot...) 

             The manager found me, and started yelling to me from literally the other side of the store. This part is a blur, but all I remember is yelling ""I'M DEPRESSED, PLEASE DON'T CALL THE COPS, I'M LEAVING, I'M HAVING A HARD TIME) (lol imagine this happening) 

           Anyway, I meet my dopeman in his raggedy, beatup, diarrhea colored Buick in the parking lot, buy the dope, and drive home to my house (Yes, I had gas this whole time hehe)  The time is around 12PM. 

         I got 6 bags i think. They were good bags too. White, flakey, almost candy-smelling heroin, with a little whiff of Vitamin B12 and bacon as for the smell as well. Weird combination. Anyway, I think I shot up 2 or 3 bags, and must've made a PB&J sandwich and a bowl of cereal after shooting them. My mom told me she walked by my room, and saw me sitting in my computer chair with my head back, a half a sandwich sitting on my chest, a bite of sandwich in my mouth, and milk and cereal all over the floor. She claims she woke me up, and walked me over to the futon to lay down. I don't remember any of this part at all. 

         Some time after this, I must've woken up and decided to finish the rest of my dope, because the last thing I remember is waking up on the futon waaaaay later in the day. The time was 7PM. 

         I wake up laying on my stomach on my futon, groggy as FUCK, feeling like a truck hit me. I'm talking benz'd the fuck out, with no recollection of even getting out of bed this morning. I lift my head up, and see an uncapped syringe laying under my chest, and a dried trail of blood on my left forearm. I sit up with my head spinning. My mom comes in the room with a look that spelled out a mix of worry, shock, and confusion. 
          ""Do you know what you did today?"" She asked in a normal voice, not yelling or talking down to me or anything. 
        ""Uhhhhh, no?"" I answered. I was actually being honest, because I didn't know. 
        ""You went to work, quit your job, somehow got incredibly fucked up, and passed out with a sandwich laying on your stomach and a bowl of cereal spilled all over the floor!"" She exclaimed. 
             It all hit me like a ton of bricks. The entire recollection of that day burrowed into my brain at that moment like a Madagascar cockroach. 
           ""Whooaaa, I really did. Holy shit. What the fuck??? How???"" I said, completely perplexed with my actions. 

        From that moment forward, I learned to respect the ultimate authority and power that is pure alprazolam powder. I had officially roofied myself.

I always felt like I was recovering from a stomach bug. Ive been on ondasteron, phenergan, fucking even pepto bismol and tums to try and help with this. 

Then I was introduced to kefir.
Apparently it fixes your gut biome.
Seemed like a weird idea. But i gave it a try.

This shit tastes awful. It nearly made me throw up at first, as I drank it when i was feeling nauseous. Tastes like rotten liquid cheese. Thicker than melted ice cream. And it gave me the shits for 2 days.

Steve Harvey looked at me. ""Welcome to my trailer bitch"". He snarled. 

Confused I pulled out my meth pipe. 
""Y'all ever heard of the 4 stroke gang?"" 

Steve took the pipe from me. Took a long hit. 
Blew it out. His penis became so sensitive he started splooging everywhere.

He then beat the red headed step child. Spanked Cinderella and then stared deep into my soul. ""Your next white boy"".

Before I got onto subs my drug of choice were pills, mostly oxycodone. They were so freakin expensive so usually I could only afford to take 60-100mg a day. I started on 6mg sub, tapered to 4mg then broke my arm. When I broke my arm badly the doctor upped my dosage to 24mg a day hoping to help me avoid going onto full agonist pain killers. My arm healed but I did not taper and I began to take way more than prescribed. I'd always end up short at the end of the month and would buy some subs at super high prices from a few people I knew. 

In April I ran out two weeks early. No one I knew had enough to sell. I tried to cut my dose down but I would always take more than I rationed figuring I would ""start tomorrow, just 4mg tomorrow for a few days then 2mg and I'll make it to my refill date"".

I didn't have any way to get oxy. I was so out of the game. Finding a hook up was a miracle. I didn't cold cop. I cant say exactly how I found a new middle, but I did.

After a week or two of messaging back and forth we finally made the meet up. He told me $100/g and I told him I'd like a gram and that I would give him $100 for helping. I still had money to spare, so that wasn't a problem. The whole thing went down smoothly. I got home, weighed the bag and it was only .7g. I decided not to say anything because I thought maybe that is how it goes. Usually coke is sold in $50s around here and its .7g despite the dealer calling it a g. 

I had taken my last 6mg of sub 12 hours before and I started my journey into fent dope with the tiniest bump worried that I could possibly OD immediately from this super powerful substance. Nothing much happened. Naturally I still had plenty of buprenorphine holding tight onto my receptors. After a few hours I did reach a state of well being. The stress of mild sub withdrawal was lifted. It was nice. I saved the rest for work the next day and on the way home asked my middle if I could get a $150. No problem he said, it was like he was just waiting for me and was ready. Another smooth transaction. I get home and weigh it, this time it was 1.4g, close enough to 1.5g. It also had what appeared to be and tasted like crushed up Xanax. There were these soft bluish bits, one was quite large. This dope also appeared to be much stronger. It really hit me, wonderful euphoria. That was it, the hooks were in me, my relapse was complete.

As time went on the quality of the dope went up and down. Also the weight of the bags went wild. I am not sure exactly what my middle does in order to benefit from getting me dope. Sometimes the bags would be HUGE but the quality was shit. Like one time he gave me 6g for $200 and it was absolute garbage. 

Early in our relation while I was in the worst withdrawal I had ever experienced he gave me something totally bunk. I thought that was it, he decided to burn me and burn the bridge. I texted him just to say it isn't doing anything. I expected no response. To my surprise he was also in the same boat. I turned around and within an hour he got me a new bag of some real fire. It got me high as a kite and bolstered my faith in him as a trustworthy middle.

For a few weeks everytime I bought a ""gram""  or ""2 grams"" the bag(s) would actually be 2-2.5g and most of the time very high quality. I wasn't understanding how he was benefiting from me. Sometimes though the bag would be soooo much and the powder of a more granular consistency and a much lower potency. I wondered if he was scooping some out and putting regular sugar in it.

More recently though the bags have now returned to be just one gram. The quality is immensely better but it's very rare for it be much over. I guess I can't complain. I got used to taking higher doses because my gram bags were two grams. Now I am doing 2-4 grams a day if I can afford it. It's a very tough day if I have to make it through on just a gram. Fentanyl has no legs at all.

I am very nice and itchy and noddy right now though, and that's why I wanted to right the story. Just a few days ago he was giving me deals like 2g for $130 so I got all these deals and did 2-3 grams a day. Then yesterday I go and spend $200 and the bag is only 1.8g. It was the strongest I have had yet but fuck. I let him know and today gave him $160 and he gave me 2g. That bag weight is all over the map. He must be scooping some out and yesterday scooped too much. So I imagine he benefifs from either grabbing a few points or charging a little more than his guy charges. He also middles for a few other people so maybe his guy hooks him up due to him bringing so much business. Sometimes I give him some extra money, give him a bunch of cigarettes or let him use my credit card to get gas or food.

At the end of the day he's a great middle and performs me a good service. I really really need to stop though. I went back on my suboxone for 3 days last week, I thought I would make it. Now I'm high as hell on fentdope. I am such a world of shit financially, such huuuuge problems.

That same night this girl (who we'll call L) emailed us saying she could get us a hookup. Because we were broke we couldn't do it but we stayed in contact just in case. As a thank you for offering to help I told L if she needed a favor she could ask us and we'd see what we could do. 

Last night she asked if we could help her because she was out, broke, and sick. Unfortunately we were in the same boat, but I said I'd see what I could do. Later that night I found a MS Contin 30 but by the time I tried to call she was asleep (we were still sick but because we don't shoot it wouldnt even get us well). 

This morning our dealer called and said he needed a favor (because he doesn't have a car and he knows we've been struggling financially we have an arrangement where we'll give him a ride, deliver dope, drop off his dry cleaning, etc, and he'll throw us a .50 and some gas money). 

So we do the favor, get our bag, and I just started feeling really terrible that this girl, who I've never met, never even seen her face, was suffering through withdrawals. I put aside about .2 and told her I could help. She doesn't have a car so she said I'd have to meet her. I'm low on gas, have no cash, but the thought of this girl suffering, or going out and blowing some guy to get cash wouldn't leave my mind. 

I drove down there, waited for 25 minutes because her ride was late, and gave her the dope and the morphine. She was so happy she broke into tears. I'm not making this post to be all ""check me out I'm a generous saint"", just trying to remind you guys that we're all in this together. Sure, a lot of people are dicks who will take advantage of as many people as possible, but the vast majority of us are just struggling to get by. It doesn't take giving someone a gram for free to help them, even something small can help.

Edit: While everything in the post is written in the first person my SO was in this with me the whole way. She feels the exaxt same way I do about the situation. 

Edit 2: Whether you do or do not believe in Karma, something interesting happened today. I just lost my job so I've been looking for odd jobs anywhere I think I'll find one. I made posts on Facebook, Craigslist, Next Door, etc, explaining my story and offering to do jobs for people. I get a few replies with the usual stuff (landscaping, general labor, minor construction) which I'm more than happy to do and it seemed my luck was slightly turning around. Just slightly. 

About 20 minutes after I got home from meeting L I get a response that's just this gentleman's name and phone number. On the phone he tells me he's essentially a professional handyman and that the amount of business is growing faster then his current group can handle. He said he'd love to meet me, and if he likes the first impression I have a job. Basically we're going to meet and talk a little, then I start working almost immediately to see if I'm fit for the work.

I typically use heroin but my girl just recently picked up oxycodone and im not really getting anything out of it... she got 20mg lil blue(grey) ones i think they said k 57 on them, the first day i snorted 15mg and got a nice little itch and felt pretty good at first then fell asleep and woke up to try the same thing and literally felt nothing. I snorted another 10mg and still felt nothing.

I gave up and snorted some boy and barely even felt that too!

Im confused because I know my tolerance for boy is manageable and I don't really ever have to increase my dosages by much if any and I try my best to keep it low as possible but now my tolerance or something got all fucked up maybe my nose just wont absorb it anymore or something idk.

I guess my point to this is is there anything I can do to increase the bioavailiability? i know snorting isnt the best but i figure ill atleast get high from the drip and a little bit of rush cause i love the drip and act of crushing/snorting...
And does tolerance rapidly increase with oxies versus heroin?

I started opiates at 12 and ended at around 25, started up after 3 years. Those 3 years were basically pure misery, couldn't keep a job. Tried killing myself, went on all sorts of medications(anti depressants etc), therapy i did everything. Even got in very good shape( ripped, shredded with 6 pack abs) but the depression just never got better. took a shit ton of benzos and painkillers and did a half ass attempt at killing myself. i can't keep a job, the second i get money i spend it all on drugs. so those 3 years were me living at my dads.

I don't really chase an extreme high it's mostly i take enough to get a mood lift but that is never sustainable. doing it for so long the mood lifts only last ike two hours. So even though i'll only do like 30 mgs in one shot. if i have them i'll end up doing 200 mg's in one day.

i don't know what to do anymore, i cannot live sober, i did my best and tried very hard. i can't live life on pain killers because i go broke and lose my job to fast. I think about killing myself 24-7.

what the hell should i do? Get on methadone or subs for life? something to just barely tickle my opi receptors long half life where i don't feel like killing myself all day? Right now the only road seems to lead to my death.

Or even weirder, you’ll have your eyes closed nodding and you will still visualize what you think is in front of your closed eyes, clear as day but obviously a bit more hallucinogenic.
I have however noticed there is very little open eyes visuals, however. That’s so weird that there would be such intense CEVs, I highly suspect it’s due to the molecules structural similarity to phenethylamines (like MDMA and 2C-B) as well as it having a 4 hydroxy group attachment much like our friends DMT and Psilocybin.


This drug is seriously underrated! And not only does it give classic opiod euphoria (especially when plugged.. DONT snort! Will burn bad!), but it also has these crazy nodding hallucinations created out of your collective memories of recent. It’s like I’d close my eyes to nod then a minute later I could make out my wall and blanket and be like “wait I thought my eyes were closed” only to open them and find I was right, and most of the time my open eyed visuals (normally, non-hallucinations) were nowhere near where I was convinced they were based on what I saw with eyes closed. But I didn’t just hallucinate stuff that’d been within my sight shortly before nodding, I also witnessed serene landscapes and entities. Like some DMT or high level acid trip shit 😝 it was wild


And yet another unique property of this opiod- it almost even seems to produce GABA or GABA-like activity because it can make me stumble, feel very dreamy and forgetful as well..
And at 0.65¢ For 100 mg doses from india (i only took 125 mg and tripped/nodded sack, this may be the great new opiod.

I start looking around for it on the bathroom floor while he goes to grab some more boy to make up the difference and all of a sudden the door gets closed and I am now cornered by a 6’ 5” junkie with a massive kitchen knife and he’s trying to rob me/force me to buy his clearly fake drugs. I make it very clear I’m not interested and need to leave. I try to pass him and manage to get the door open. As soon as my foot crossed the threshold he slams me up against the wall and sticks the knife point in my side and forces me back into the bathroom. He says “I ain’t no gangster, but right now I don’t give a fuck. You aren’t leaving this bathroom till I have everything on you” so I pulled out a 20 and tell him that’s all I have left after copping my shit. He isn’t having it. He comes at me with the knife down and I basically spin move out of the way and broke the door off the hinge barreling through it. And I am booking it for the front door with Knife Boy hot on my tail. Everyone starts screaming to stop ME! Mr.Traphouse is on the porch and blocks me from getting outside. So I yelled “this dudes trying to rob me with a knife” Knife boy holds up the knife and denies such a thing happening. Mr.Traphouse pistol whips him out cold. Happened so fast I jumped.

I’m an awkward loser and I feel like an alien.

I was sexually abused by my older brother for 3 years almost everyday which started anywhere from 4-6 it’s hard to remember. 

I have horrible fucking mental illness from it. Crippling PTSD, depression, anxiety and insomnia. I also suffer HPPD from years of daily chronic cannabis abuse and psychedelic abuse and I can’t use those anymore cause they cause serious disassociation. 

Anyway,My girlfriend just dumped me out of nowhere after on and off for 5 years, 3 years on and I also found out she was cheating. I loved her man. She is the only girl I’ve ever come close to having sex with. 

All around me i see people my age living life to the fullest. They’re going places, they have goals and aspirations, they have no problem being social, they have no problems making friends, they have no problems getting girls.

I am so fucking alone. And I truly don’t care weather I live or die.

I have some experience with opiates. I use Vicodin and Oxy when I can get my hands on it, but in this area it is so fucking rare to get pills, they might as-well be non existent. There is no open air market.

However it is super easy to get Tar. 

Tomorrow I’m truly planning on buying my first gram. If I die I fucking die I guess.

Following the recommendations of the sub I started boofing it, and dayum. This is awesome. It’s already liquid, so I’m not going through any crushing and diluting and bullshit. Along with adderall it’s the best. I can’t cum at ALL when I use it though, that’s so god damn frustrating!!! I made the mistake of using it like, every three days, that was 2 weeks of no orgasms. I didn’t get that memo before taking it, the sex feels amazing but no release!! Now, I only do like 1ml of 30mg like once a week. Morphine can’t be cutting into my 15 years of masturbation habits. It also helps me sleep. My god. The sleep afterwards is great. 

Should I be using water with it to boof if it’s already liquid?

I actually thought it was long lost, but after searching around quite a bit, I found some old notebooks, and thankfully, this was one piece I had in there.  Much of the stuff I lost was due to typing up pieces, only to have a hard drive crash without having backed things up properly.  I ended up going back to pen and paper shortly after that happened, though I haven't had the inspiration to write anything in years, hence sharing older stuff.  I wrote it back in '03, I remember quite well.  I hadn't been using terribly long, was all about some 80s, and had just discovered a lot of the guys that would become personal favorites, like Whitman, Thoreau, and Emerson.  I'm sure I was probably trying to emulate them somewhat, which isn't to say I actually succeeded lol.  But, it was weird revisiting the piece years later, just because, while I hadn't been using long enough to be a full blown addict, I could see the road I was headed down in retrospect, just seeing where my mind was at the time.  Anyway, enough introduction...)


As I solemnly stroll through the barren field

Serene as it may seem

The field is filled with all I've killed

Crushed hopes and broken dreams

--

And where do I lie

In this hazily constructed area

It occurs to me

How strange all of this is

Others see me clearly

Perceived as quite askew

Though I can see nothing

As I peer from an obstructed view

Yet still I hope to find that line

The line that is straight

Which I'm obviously not used to

--

Most of my exploits

Involved a path quite jagged

Justifying how I ended up in this mess to begin with

--

It seems every turn to take in this field

Leads to the wrong place

Either that or I'm led back to the beginning

Which is equally as frustrating

--

Because then

I have to once again

Face all of these obstacles

Constantly growing exponentially

As many aspects of me continue to fade away

--

Not quietly, as the setting sun

But rather viciously

Like a child being scarred for the first time

--

They can only fade for so long

Until their existence ceases altogether

And if at that point

I have yet to make it through this field

I'll be forced to wander aimlessly

For an eternity, or perhaps longer

--

But at this point it is hard to tell

What I am searching for

Hopefully I could find some of the things I've lost

And possibly revive some that I've killed

--

Although I was seeking an end to this maze

I suppose in the end

To find the happiness I've misplaced

Could be better than any other imaginable outcome

--

So I begin again

Back to the front, tabula rasa

Unsure of where to start

Like a newborn attempting to learn to speak

With no one around to help teach

--

I catch a glimmer in the far distance

So I follow the bright light

I believe at one point in time

I was told that this was a viable option

--

But the longer I walk toward the light

The farther away it appears

--

Logic would tell one to rethink the plan at this point in time

But there is no time for that

So I continue walking, trusting my instincts

For that is all that I'm left with

Because I have lost everything else

Somewhere in this damn field

And with no clue where to look

This bright light must be an omen

--

So I muster up any vigor that remains

In this former shell of myself

And try to find my way amongst all this treachery

To the shining light

--

This time, however, as I begin approaching the light

It does not seem to distance itself from my onslaught

In fact, it is locked in place at this point

Statue-esque as if struck by Medusa herself

--

""A-Ha!""

I say to myself

""This time I've got the little bastard""

--

So I begin to run

Sprinting with all my might

Toward this shining light

And while its mobility may have been nullified

A feeling of terror still encompasses what remains of this mortal coil

--

As I approach this time

The light becomes increasingly dimmer

And the closer I get

The quicker it fades

--

I begin to wonder if this journey is even worth the time

Though my other options are quite limited

Or rather nonexistent, if you must

--

As I make it to the location of the light it has completely faded

And all is dark again

--

Just as I begin to ponder

Any possibility of escaping this predicament

All of my concerns soon become irrelevant

--

The darkness emitted this light to lure me in

As nonchalantly as a fisherman

--

And just like that fisherman

Now that it has grasped me

And has me for its own

Everything that I know matters no more",1529140270.0

He was like ""yeah man for sure go park over there I'll be over there in a second'

Came over and was like 'homegirls in the bathroom in the store right there, just give me the money and I'll run over and grab it""

(AKA middle man used phone to call plug and left number on there),"Hi all, if you were a dealer, would you be happy for a new customer? I mean i know there are people who would be happy to get a new customer to make $$$$, but then there are some who get sketched out easily.

The situation is kind of like this, found out a coworker also does dope. Powder dope is more rare and costs more. 'China White' is all my coworker buys and does. He only snorts, where i use rigs and tar since most of my area all I've had luck finding is tar. After finding out he used, we'd drive up sometimes to cop. My tar dude lives a few miles away from his guy so we'd just share a ride sometimes. I would get my tar, he would get his China. He kept telling me to try it so I did one day. It was definitely a different feeling. The Tar would keep me well longer, but the rush from the China was a different type of rush, kind of more euphoric in a way. 
Anyways, so since trying it, I've started to throw in money a few times to get something from his guy. But some reason I suspect he tries to pinch it no matter what, even when I get a dub. It's ironic because  whenever my coworker will get a dub for himself, it will look extra fat, but whenever i throw in money to get a dub, it'll be extra small. Like maybe twice when i couldn't go up, i've asked for a half G and he'd bring me back something I thought was a .5, but after seeing his sacks, it would look like a dub his dealer gives him. i don't have a scale so I never knew. 
ANd this is everytime, when only he gets something from his guy, it looks fat, but everytime i throw in for something, he'll say that's just what he gave him and i'tll be mad small. 
My coworker also doesn't have a phone so he uses mine when we go up together and always deletes the number after. But 2 days ago, he left the number in there while he went outside and i wrote the number down before he deleted it after he came back in.

So i have the guys number, but i don't know his name. My coworker did a good job of making his connect avoid coming to the car as well. Liek everytime, I've dropped him off like 20 feet away or he'd alway get out of the car to walk to his guy. Now I know why. So I don't think he's ever seen my face before, but possibly my car. I could keep getting tar, but i want to try something new, if you guys were in my situation, how would you guys try to reach out to the China plug? Or would you even try? I don't know if my coworker was trying to scare me or not, but he said never go down there alone. He said dudes down there will just take ur money if they don't know you and just say, 'what money'? , but i'm sure if i can make myself out to be a steady customer that will bring steady cash flow, he'd be happy for that, no?",1529116708.0

Addressing Running into Traffic from Post 2
====

**I realize running into traffic was a bad idea. I really could have endangered someone else and I own it that that was wrong. If I could apologize to those drivers I would. I was in a very fucked up state of mind. Anyway, I'm currently checking into an outpatient treatment center. They do not feel inpatient is right for me especially since I'm already detoxed. Right now I'm just going to put the pieces back together, own and accept my mistakes and move forward.**

I know I'm Disliked Here
===

Despite being disliked by some here, I feel sharing my story is not only cathartic or important for myself but, it if it at least helps one other person going through the same sort of shit, then good. I'm glad I shared. We've all done fucked up things with our addictions, and now it's about restoring the damage done and moving forward. I just hate how quick some of you are to judge when you're not going through it. Just like I can't judge you based on a few paragraphs or stories - you can't judge me because of what I have to on a opiates related forum. I don't sit and judge anyone here. I find mutual respect is the best medicine. **I kindly ask that any critiques given are constructive and not downright mean.** I'm really trying to improve here and am taking the first steps towards that.

5 Days Sober, Let's Restart
===

Just working on my life now. I have several job potentials in my email plus I'm meeting with a counselor Monday. They require 3 recovery meetings a week along with 9 hours worth of recovery group work weekly. We'll see if this program is a fit for me. It's covered by my insurance - their inpatient is not. Either way, I'm just picking up the pieces and starting over. The recovery AA/NA or SMART meetings are way outside of my comfort zone. They're just emotionally triggering so I have a friend that's willing to take me to my first meeting hopefully it goes well, we'll see. 

The Pain is Real
===

I have a real pain problem. Even the counselor today asked if I was still in withdrawal or pain. The pain is localized so I'm pretty sure it's actual pain vs. withdrawal. Especially because my UA came up negative for opioids. I do have a residual cold now though because of the exhaustion and lowered immune system from the withdrawal but that's not a biggie. What's going to be trick is finding something that works for the pain that isn't opiate based. I think right now it's all about keeping clear and developing better coping mechanisms for my situation. I'm not sure what that looks like right now but at least I'm taking steps towards it.",1529109093.0

I'm curious whether it would be possible for someone who was on 'done 
- and decided they want to stop using it for whatever reason - to stay well with dope after cessation of the juice. I know that methadone is strong so I imagine if it's feasible, it would only be for those whose dose of the methadone was in the lower range (say 30-80 mg per day).

I have been for like 4 months. 8mg a day is a big jump and really fast taper for methadone but still better then the other option. It's day 3 I'm at 56mg today.

I am going to do a shot right before arriving that should hold me over for a solid 5-6 hours, but I know that around that point is when I usually notice feeling kinda anxious. We are all volunteering for a cause that I care a lot about, and will be on the phone talking to folks the entire time so I need to be on my game/feeling comfortable. 

If I fix a shot and bring it with me, is there anything that I should be aware of? I know that dope in water begins to change molecularly into morphine so I realize it will be weaker. I just don’t want to get into the bathroom and the dope have turned into a solution that is too thick or weird to use. I don’t feel comfortable fixing a shot there due to time/all the different accessories that I would need. 

I am using tar, and it does occasionally take some work to get a large shot into the rig, so I’m thinking that I should make a few shots with more water than I normally use to be safe and not have it become too thick to shoot.

I am on suboxone maintenance but I have been clean from heroin a year on May 22nd. 

I would be proud of myself except when it came out that I was a heroin addict to my family, it motivated my cousin to go to our family and admit that she was struggling with her sexuality and with alcoholism too. She said she wouldn't have done it if I wouldn't have gotten help. She went to rehab and had gotten sober from alcohol. She was in the National Guard, had graduated certified in chemical weaponry iirc. I was so proud of her. She had always looked up to me and followed in my foot steps but this past year we had really bonded and looked to each other for support. We would text or snap each other telling each other that we were proud of each other and that we motivated each other. She was a HUGE support to me. Just having her look up to me and having her be motivated by me made me want to keep doing good.

Well, May 2nd of this year was my 29th birthday. My last birthday in my 20's and 20 days shy of one year clean of heroin. It started out as a normal day but ended up the worst day of my life. I'm not sure when it happened, but my cousin had fallen off the wagon at some point and had killed herself on my birthday. This really, really, really, fucked with me. I'm SLOWLY getting better but there was a solid month where I didn't know if I was coming or going. The only reason I didn't relapse was because I knew she would be disappointed in me. I blamed myself. I have a lot of regrets regarding my cousin that I can't get over. I know that I need to go to counseling to really work through this and that is my plan, I just have to get some things out of the way first, one mainly being my dog's surgery. Which I took care of yesterday. My dog is like my kid and I was really worried about her. Now that that is off my plate, I thought I could relax some but my ex seems to have impeccable timing and decided to text me after months of no contact. 

I'm trying to stay healthy, and on the right path. For the last year I've been talking to a guy that I did absolutely fall in love with but he didn't feel the same about me and I could hear it in his voice. I don't want to be with someone who doesn't want to be with me because it just makes me feel bad about myself, so I broke it off. It still fucking hurts really fucking bad, but I can't force him to love me. It's sad though because a lot of our issues are internet related (we were long distance) and i'm sure if we lived near each other those things wouldn't even be an issue.... Anyway, the ex from my heroin days is texting me again. Apparently he is doing good and I'm glad he is doing good but I feel like he is trying to squeeze his way back into my life again and I know for a fact that this cannot happen. We were toxic for each other. I know this. I hate that he is hurting over me, but if we ever ended up together again, which we won't, it would end VERY bad. I told him yesterday that I didn't want him to get any ideas of us getting back together and to start calling me and obsessing over me and he said that he wouldn't, he just needed a friend and I know the most about him (we lived together 10 years). That would be believable if there wasn't 20 texts from him on my phone this morning and for the fact that he has been texting me all fucking day. I am trying to stay on the right path but with everything negative that's happened recently - breaking up with the guy i'm really in love with, my dogs surgery, my cousins death, etc., I hope I'm strong enough to put a stop to this.. I really do. Any suggestions are welcome.. I need the help. ",1529099879.0

Doesn’t knock me on my ass, and if I’m out and about doing stuff I’m not really impaired, just cheery. 

I came across some XR morphine 30. If this sounds familiar I already made a post about this asking questions a week ago but now I have just a slightly different question for anyone who has the time to help a sister out.

Planning on plugging it because of BA. So using the charts on the sticky I see that orally 10mg of morphine is 6.67 mg of oxy, so my 30mg morphine equivalent to roughly 20mg oxycodone. So this is where I want to double check. If the bioavailability for the morphine goes up from 30% orally to 70% rectally, the 30mg morphine should go from being equivalent to 20mg of oxy to more like 45 mg. Does that sound about right? Because if so I’m looking at a dose that’s a little higher than what I’m use to and should maybe start with less than a full pill? 

And does the crushing and plugging bypass the time release? I’m thinking that would effect the potency one way or the other as well. 

What do you guys think? I used all the sidebars like I’m suppose to before asking, just want to make sure I’m getting it right. 

Interested in hearing from people familiar with the dose and roa as well.

What do they treat you with at the hospital?  Do they take into account your obviously an opiate addict but still treat you with opiates?  Hasn’t happened to me (thankfully) but curious how one would be treated in this circumstance.  ,1529089041.0

This was a while back.

I understand that taking an opiate THEN  taking suboxone will cause percipitated withdrawal. But will it do the same if you take it in reverse? Ex. I am currently on 2mg of suboxon daily (recently switched from methadone) and am wondering if I do some hydromorph tonight will it cause percipitated withdrawals?

I vaguely remember it not causing it back when I was using but just want some reassurance from the community. 

Thanks in advance.",1529082363.0
