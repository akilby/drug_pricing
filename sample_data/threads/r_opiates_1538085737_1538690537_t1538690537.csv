I was in the presence of oxymorphone, my old DOC, last night out of sheer coincidence after I went to pick up a bar (which I also keep relapsing on but they're pressed and unpredictable / dangerous). I wanted so bad to ask the dude for a bump of it, even though I've been on sub/kratom so I may not really feel it. 

The sub I had is gone now, and I dont even have support because I become so codependent on one person. Then when something happens with us, and I need space I'm just left alone with the black void that is my head in a constant state of sub/kratom/benzo/gabapentin withdrawal. 

I'm thinking of checking myself into rehab but I'm afraid of the one best friend I have abandoning me if I do go away for weeks or months and I am more terrified of that than the actual relapses or anything else that comes with being an addict. 

I'm so fucking scared and alone and betrayed so the best I can do is talk to some text on a screen typed by people going through similar shit. 

I have almost 4 years clean from my DOC and today can honestly say I wanna throw it all away. Maybe I'll just do meth since thats better than opioids, right..? /s

Edit: to be honest I dont even wanna do any of these drugs, I just want the pain to FUCKING STOP. Since it obviously isnt, ever, what I'd really like is to just be dead. Please god.

I am getting 80mg a day and been on the program two weeks.  Started at 30mg and ramped up 10 a day till 60, stayed for a week then  10 a day till I got to 80.     So my body isn't too attached to methadone because I haven't been on that long. 

My question is, should I risk not telling the dr or the anethisologist?  (Sp).     Reason I am considering risking it is because I'd prefer ""heroin addict"" stay out of my medical file.     I am going to be in a child custody battle soon and I am going to deny her claim that I am an addict.   To protect myself from the chance that my medical records were examined by the court I'd prefer that there was no mention of anything H related. 

If I do tell the dr. I am on MMT I wonder if he would give me more pain meds to break thru and actually relieve the pain or if he'd take the other route and assume the methadone would work for my post op pain and not want to risk prescribing an addict any more opiates than he had to

Not to mention I miss the warmth, even though the feelings aren't as amazing as they used to be.

Here's the backstory: introduced to percocet 15yrs ago, absolutely loved it. I felt energized, productive, happy, it was amazing. Ive been chasing this high for years, but haven't felt it in at least 5yrs. After 5 straight years of percocet, morphine and oxy I felt it took over my life and I decided I had to quit. Cold turkey quit, counting every hour and marking them down in a notebook (attempting to feel accomplished every hour I abstained) and felt like dying. I did use weed and lots of hot showers and music to get through. I did it, and stayed clean for probably a year.

After a year, my brain remebered the amazingness and I relapsed. Blah blah same shit until I couldn't get percs anymore and started with the oxys. I loved them. Used another year and quit again for 2 years. Started back up after an injury and haven't once had that energizing, productive, warm high ive been chasing. I've just been feeling so unmotivated, don't even want to get out of bed, just nod, wake up and medicate, only to nod more... All day.

So... My brain is stuck remembering how amazing it once was, I justify taking another because at this point I just want to sleep and feel happy/relaxed, but what's the point? I know I won't get that awesome high I used to, I know I won't feel motivated and generally ""better"" at all, I'll have to reset AGAIN, and I'm not even really happy when I take them anymore. So why the hell do I want to so bad? 

Also, I did a reset 2 weeks ago and went 11days before the depression and suicidal thoughts made me relapse. Scary shit. So I went a week taking 10mg a day and now I'm back to 2 days clean. Well, 40.5 hours clean.",1538688714.0

I dont think its even intentional or malicious but i wish people would consider this before saying that type of shit. It sucks and id trade a pill script to not have chronic pain anymore.  

Similarly but worse: just fuckin dont come here and ask us for tips to manipulate a script for the sole purpose to get high.

*Current use period: Back on it since February 18*

*Before that: On and Off Use of 10 to 15 Grams since November 17.*

*Clean before November till September 17./ Prior use 1 year.*

I am not experiencing the side effects like constipation, tiny pupils and not beeing able to pee. Of course I am also not experiencing any euphoria. Mainly im very lethargic but wouldnt consider myself as in withrawl, cause I am able to sleep.

To the question: Is this normal after prolonged period of opiate abuse? I abused before for long periods but always had at least tiny pupils as a side effect. Has someone else experienced this? Is this because of tolerance, or could there be something fucked organicaly?

I certainly did. In fact, when I went into substitution and they asked me for my family history followed by my personal history of drugs (first time trying weed, first time speed, coke, MDMA, etc) I realised for the first time properly just how much I fulfilled the classic pattern of an addict: exposed to drugs at an incredibly young age, tried each new one at a younger age than others around me, used other substances compulsively, genes inherited from a long line of addicts, abusive home life that included trauma I wasn't really able to handle on my own but for a long time didn't even truly understand or recognise...In fact, it's only recently that I realised that I was a poster child for addiction - a close family member was giving me amphetamines when I was fucking 10 years old, and I first had a line of coke aged 12. In that context, it's a miracle I only tried smack when I was 23 and after having graduated from university...

Anyway, apologies for the slightly drug-addled detour. The reason I'm posting is because having gone pretty much directly to heroin, the only withdrawals I know are from smack or substitution. I'm not sure which is worse; methadone is milder but it last forever compared to heroin and both turn me into a desperate insomniac for months. But I've never had to go cold turkey from fentanyl, dilaudid, oxycodone or any other pharmaceutical opiates.

Are they different from coming off heroin? Easier? Worse? I'd like to know. For what it's worth, I lived for a while in New York and took oxys there but not enough to get hooked on them specifically - I was taking ECP as well. When I binged on oxys (snorting them), I'd get a horrible headache that I never experienced from smack. The high, in general, felt artificial in a way that I'd never experienced before. I read a lot of posts here where people describe unpleasant symptoms that I associate with oxys but not heroin - headaches, neuralgia, migraines, troubled dreams...

So - right - what I'm wondering is: are withdrawals from synthetic opiates different from coming off heroin and, if so, in what way? If you had to (and I mean had to) choose one opiate to come off, which would it be? And, conversely, if you have one you never want to come off cold turkey, which is it?

(From what I've heard, coming off fentanyl addiction sounds especially hellish. It's just appearing where I live and I'm coming across fent addicts for the first time. From what they say, the high is intense but it doesn't hold as long as heroin so they're using 2-3 times as often and when they don't, they start clucking really fast, rather than the slow onset you get from smack...It sounds like a nightmare!)",1538680669.0

I have a very high tolerance, which sucks balls but it is what it is: 250-300 mg of oxy, more or less, usually taken with a kpin.

Well, as often is the case, I ran out of meds early. The kpin was first to go. I felt a bit nervous, but that was mainly my being nervous about the shit storm I thought I was heading into....but it never came!

When I got through my oxy I was prepared for the double whammy of benzo & opi withdrawal. It never came! I’m talking about 1-2 weeks. Usually on the first day after not having my klonopin I feel shitty. I take 2mg twice a day.

About eleven years ago I had a decent (about a year) run with different pills. Mostly methadone and morphine.. occasionally codeine, oc, Vicodin, that sort of stuff. At the high point was doing about 20-30mg of 'done daily with the occasional 100mgs or so of morphine mixed in.

Since then I still dabble from time to time, but this past year I have been a dipping in a bit more again. Once a month I'll grab a dozen 'dones and and a dozen norcs (both 10mg). I generally try to keep my dosing limited to the weekends, but I'm not always successful at that. I don't do more than one of each at a time (if I do take some during the week it is usually half of each one), and to be honest my tolerance doesn't seem to grow much; these small doses have worked for me and continue to. Although I'm also one of those rarities that can catch a buzz from 50mg of tramadol.

I read through posts here, and I understand everyone is different, but it makes me question the true nature of my relationship with these substances. I feel like if I even doubled the dose I'm accustomed to I would become unusable - is that what the average user is chasing here? What I'm seeking is that instilled sense of well-being that rarely comes out without the application of pharms (sometimes from kratom). I mean the body buzz is certainly nice but it is that sprinkle of euphoria that I am really after.

Am I trying to address something that could be better approached by something else? Something that I don't need to lie about to my fiance? She knows about my past, but it would break her heart to know I still feel like I need something like this.",1538659682.0

In total I snorted about 50mg of the powder. During a few hours I felt what I guess is a typical heroin high, nodding out a few times but always using my phone (I guess that means I didn’t OD). But instead of gently subsiding like I heard it should have, it seemed to have progressively intensified while the positive aspects disappeared. I was overwhelmed with intense nausea and vertigo every time I tried to move, until I had to throw up in a bucket at about midnight: this seems to have made things better but the symptoms didn’t subside. I managed to sleep for a few hours with some interruptions, but now, although I’m feeling better, I’m still feeling the nausea and vertigos. It’s 7:00 am now.

I know that ive completely ruined my life chasing this high, and nothing but negativity comes from it, but i'm still doing it. It's been almost 4 years since i got hooked. During one sober period i was so fucking determined to stop. I used to go by the thought that 'you have to want to quit more than you want to get high'... And i was so fucking sure that i reached that point. I was for sure that the life i was living was nothing but misery... & i turned it around and started putting the pieces back where they were supposed to be.

 Then life hit. 

One terrible mishap after another. I watched my cat slowly die, after the vets told me he would pull through. I was crushed, did everything i possibly could. I still kept clean. Had to pay extra money to keep my apartment, leaving me completely broke and hungry for weeks, still kept clean. Went through the worst heartbreak ive ever been through... Kept clean. Then one day the urge was just too much for me to handle. I broke. 

Started using again. Took me about 3 weeks to lose my apartment and move back to my moms, 500 miles away. Again i reached that point. That ""i want to get sober more than i want to get high"" thought. Went 3 weeks clean and then got hit with a court date back in the state i was living in. Worked things out with my dad and moved back in with him so i could get my court fines paid off & everything. I was so determined... Sooooo fucking determined that when i got back, i wouldnt go straight to my plug to get more dope. 

After the drive and sleeping it off, it took me about an hour to cave in and hit up the plug. Well.... Now 2 months later im still hooked. My dad kicked me out, i owe a good friend 350 dollars cause i tried to make a quick buck middlemanning and the buyer gave her fake hundreds. Once again, ive hit rock bottom.

Theres so much more to the story i can't fit in. I've done some things that make me want to kill myself just from the remorse it caused. I am such a fucking terrible person. I never was this total lowlife until i got hooked. I had everything going for me. I didnt know it at the time, but before i was hooked i was happy. Life was good. I would give everything to go back to the point where i was taking everything for granted. Yet i cant.

Im still stuck. Life has gotten far worse than i thought was even possible. Yet every... Fucking... Day... My first thought is how the fuck am i going to not be sick today? I don't feel like it's possible to get clean anymore because everytime i pick the pieces back up, i just go right back to the miserable lifestyle i was in.

I know it's all in my head. I know it's just urges that drive me. I know it's not near as glamorous as i lead myself to believe. So why? Why can't i escape? Why do i lead myself back to the path i was on? The answer to me is simple. My brain is wired to chase dopamine. No other thing in this world gives you dopamine like opiates do. Your sub-conscious doesnt care how bad it gets, it knows how much dopamine gets released when you get high.

Some people overcome this. How??? What the fuck? I dont get it? The only explanations i can come up with are that either they are only saying theyre clean to convince others to get clean or they arent nearly as predisposed to addiction as i am. Im sure both of those kinds of people exist in the world, but what about the people like me? 

I know i am strong. I have overcame things that normal people never could handle. Ive lived through things (before my addiction) that would have forced other people to opt the easy way out. Im a fucking survivor at heart. I know this to be a fact. Yet... I dont know if i can survive this hurdle. I don't know if i can get sober. I don't know if life is worth living. I thought i had it all figured out, time and time again... Yet i keep coming back. 

What the fuck am i supposed to do?

Ive been very vague about my life in this post just to save time, if you have any questions feel free to ask.

I came to possess 3 vials of 2mg/mL of Lorazepam for IM or IV use (Ativan)
all the stuff about how to administer it results in clinical settings or nurse how to tutorials. I don't have luerlock or any catheters or saline flush or dilutant. What I do have readily is access to standard BD insulin 1cc 1/2 in syringes.

Again to spell out my question..
1. Will I be able to appropriately IM using 1cc 1/2 in syringe or will that result in a subcutaneous injection?
2. Instructions on the vial say to prep for injection by diluting the drug 1:1 but since my syringes are only 1cc its a bit tricky to have that much fluid. Is it ok to inject IM or IV ativan undiluted? Is it caustic? The fluid is slighty viscid when cooled.

Any other information that can warn/reduce my harm to self regarding IM/IV administration of Ativan will be appreciated also.

Rant shitpost.,"Tl;dr Fat junkie deadbeat retard relapsed at a horrible time to relapse. That's about the depth of it.

So around 3 weeks ago I relapsed on heroin after a stay in a medical detox then roughly 2 months clean off heroin (although I was doing a lot of kratom daily) and going through absolute hell withdrawal with terrible insomnia for almost 10 days straight.

I felt like my life was still in the dump even after getting off heroin. The only thing that changed was I wasn't using. I lost both my jobs and thankfully have a supportive family member that helped me financially. Well I got a part time job and as soon as I got a paycheck it was off to the fucking races.

I have hundreds of dollars worth of debt on overdrafted debit cards and credit cards and my car insurance was just canceled. Im driving an old car with problems, no spare tire, and no insurance. I have to be out of my apartment at the end of the month and I literally just blew my whole last paycheck that was less than $300 on heroin in a week. I have no money but a pile of pennies on my desk.

A week ago I ran out of money 3 days before my next paycheck and quit cold Turkey for those 3 days. I had very mild withdrawal symptoms and no insomnia and was proud of myself for not needing subs or anything other than kratom. As soon as my paycheck cleared, I mean 7am that morning, I couldn't resist and drove straight to cop. I don't know what's wrong with me. I need to save my money and my girlfriend doesn't know I relapsed. She told me if she finds out i started using again she was gonna break up with me. 

I can't have her or my family find out. I need to save money but I can't stand being sober. I know nobody is going to change me but heroin is literally the only thing that brings me happiness anymore besides food or cigarettes. I have sex with my girlfriend maybe once a month and we live together. I have no sex drive. This shit isn't fair on her for that and many other reasons.

My buddy gets a prescription for subutex and gave me a free 8mg sublingual pill the other day. I took a sliver today and haven't used since around 11am. But my paycheck clears in a couple of hours and I work 9 hours tomorrow. I've associated working with heroin, every time I see the bathroom at work I'm triggered. The days are so long without it. 

This is kind of a shitpost and If you read it all, I appreciate it sorry for the rant. I'm just tired of getting stuck in this loop of despair.",1538627090.0

In fact, at one point when I was a boy, it got so bad that my mom forced me to go to the hospital. When I did I was diagnosed with a OSD and tumors were found in my bones. I vividly recall many nights spent with Bengay on my legs, writhing in pain on the couch or in my bed.

Truly, I can probably trace my opiate addiction back to the cough syrup Tussionex. Once, after a long day of basketball, I was in a fair amount of pain and I asked my mom if there was anything that would help. I'd tried all the regular remedies a hundred times before: tylenol, ibuprofen, etc., etc., and they had next to no effect. She suggested I have a few spoonfuls of the cough syrup, which didn't make any sense to me because I didn't have a cough. But I was desperate, so I gave it a shot. As you may know, Tussionex has hydrocodone in it, so not only it cure the pain in my legs, but it left me feeling warm and light, as if I were floating away on a perfect cloud (even if I was slightly nauseous).

I would go on to dabble with many drugs in high school, including opioids, which were undoubtedly my favorite. However, I did not become addicted and I could take them or leave them. At this point I also quit playing basketball, and for the longest time the pain in my legs subsided for the most part, flare ups becoming only occasional.

Many years later, after a surgery, I was prescribed oxycodone. For some reason, despite not falling to addiction all throughout my teenage years, in my early twenties I ended up addicted to opioids. Over the course of a couple years I went from these 5 mg oxycodones to injecting heroin, then ultimately robbing pharmacies for hydromorphone. I was caught and did roughly four years for this crime.

Now here I am, in my early 30's, and my legs are just total garbage. As in, when I walk downstairs after waking up, my knees feel like I've run a couple marathons and also like they're about to give out and send me tumbling down to break my neck. Regularly, when I stand up out of bed, I nearly fall down because I'm so unstable. I feel like my father, who's nearly 60, can walk better than me.

If I can talk myself past the pain and get walking a lot, I do okay, and the pain even seems to disappear on occasion. However, once I stop walking, it comes back with a vengeance, and I feel as though I'm being punished for trying to strengthen my legs. The backlash even leaves me inclined to simply stay in bed, which probably offsets what little good I did by walking.

I don't have a job and thus I don't have insurance, so I haven't even gone to a doctor. But at this point I'm desperate, because the pain seems to get worse every month. I live in constant fear of what my life will be like years from now if things continue progressing at this rate.

But honestly, what is a doctor even going to be able to do for me? I've tried all the OTC pain meds, as well as gabapentin and tramadol, and nothing is truly effective. Tramadol is probably the best, but I don't have a prescription for them and even if I did it would be a terrible tradeoff because while they cut through some of the pain, they also leave me feeling hollowed out and disconnected from life. It's very weird because while I know they're something of an opioid, most opioids leave me feeling energized and excited for life, while Tramadol leaves me feeling blunted and far away, even somewhat suicidal.

Currently I'm using Kratom, which certainly helps a lot, but even it is starting to not be effective and it's defnitely no longer cost effective for me because of how much I'm using to maintain my quality of life. Right now I've taken a 20 gram dose of good stuff and it still hasn't completely cut through the pain.

Since I am a felon, I don't have many prospects for work, but if I knew I wouldn't be in agony I wouldn't mind working a register or something. However, the thought of standing all day long with the way my legs feel sounds tortuous. Most of the time, even when I sit, the pain is the only thing I can really focus on.

So I guess my question is, what can I do? I know it's damn near impossible to be prescribed pain meds nowadays (and the state I am in is particularly difficult) for people without a history of addiction or a drug related criminal record, so I'm pretty well convinced it would be impossible for me. But like, there doesn't seem to be any other solution to my problem? I've tried to strengthen my legs through exercise and yoga, to no avail. My life is becoming progressively shittier and I see no way out, only the prospect of it deteriorating further.

I really have no desire to go to a doctor to only be told to try ibuprofen. At this point I'd probably murder the fucker. I know that sounds harsh, but to anyone who's ever been in pain you know how insulting it is to have someone suggest such bullshit. It's like if you accidentally swallowed lava and someone said ""drink some milk, I bet that will soothe your immolated insides"".

For the past few days I've been wondering if there is anywhere I can move to where I could get pain medication, through legal means or otherwise. It honestly doesn't matter to me the place. Hot, cold, rural, metropolitan -- hell, put me on the fucking moon. Just give me something to stop hurting, ya know? I'm even willing to move to a third world country if it means I can stop being in pain. Like, I'll sell what little I own, buy a plane ticket, and do my best to survive in whatever new place I end up in. I'm pretty much willing to work a job just to eat and have pain medication at this point. Forget a family and a house and a car and all that, just give me a tiny little hole in the wall, some books, a pen and paper, and some fucking heroin.

To anyone who read all this, thank you! I appreciate your focus and the energy you have donated to listen to me vent. If you have any ideas, please let me know. Truly, I'm willing to go anywhere. If there's a state where they still prescribe pain meds for people who are in fucking pain, I'll go there. If there's a country where I can reliably score heroin and maintain a decent existence I'm willing to go there.

I haven't been addicted to opiates since getting out of prison but every day is a battle. Not because of the mental aspect, but because of the physical. I'm already prone to depression, but I've learned to cope with that without resorting to drug use. As a friend told me, ""Mental pain is phantom pain; it's just not real. You can fight past it."" While I know that's a little simplistic, it has helped. However, once its coupled with physical pain, I feel like it essentially channels through that, finding a grounding inside you as if to say ""see, I told you everything was terrible!"". Once it finds that crack, you hurt from both angles.

So in conclusion, I'm just going to have to figure out some way to become an addict again, right? Like, I've talked myself out of going to buy heroin about a thousand times at this point, but I'm about ready to give in and just say ""this is no longer about getting high, it's about quality of life"". I feel like if I can knock out the pain I can lift my head above the water and maybe turn my life around. And if I have to become an addict again to do it, so be it. A dangerous tightrope to walk, but what other option do I have?

Anyway, again, thank you for reading this. I just woke up after only a few hours of sleep thanks to nightmares which I think are primarily caused by the pain, and once awake I couldn't fall back asleep because of the pain. I just needed to pour my frustration out.",1538626128.0

My question is, if done under very sterile conditions could I successfully take care of this one with only a couple days worth of antibiotics?

I'm a snorter, i've never smoked or shot H. But essentially what happens these days is my heart rate drops dramatically compared to what it used to whenever I'd do H, i'm talking 40-50bpm here And this comes along with all the typical effects except for euphoria. I can nod, my pupils get pinned as fuck, i get itchy, the whole deal. all without euphoria. the strange thing is that this only happens with heroin. if I use oxy or another opioid, i get euphoria. what the fuck is going on here? did I manage to subconciously condition my body into not liking heroin anymore since I overdosed? also, i can confirm i'm using legitimate H. I've tried several different sources too, and I've tested every single one. all legit, no fent, no nothing. Just H. and yet here we are, me struggling to enjoy fucking heroin. 

I was thinking of trying to smoke it to see if it'd have a different effect but I'm not entirely sure what i wanna do yet. Does anybody here have any insight as to what might be going on here?

For the majority of the time, I simply took 10mg of Oxycodone 1-3 times a day depending on my pain.

&#x200B;

 I am a 21-year old male that weighs \~130lbs. Through my hospital stay and now out of the hospital, I have definitely felt the Oxycodone have less ""effects"" (although it still easily controls my pain). Overall, I've been taking the Oxycodone for maybe 2-3 weeks, daily. Dosage goes from 10 to 30mg per day, depending on how bad my pain was. On release from the hospital, they left me with a prescription for Oxycodone, listed as ""Oxycodone HCL 10mg Tab KVK-Tech"". I am to take these once every 6 hours at my own discretion. Since being discharged last Thursday (9/27), I have already used 6 up to today (10/3) - once a day, basically. I have 4 left.

&#x200B;

Basically, I'm worried about becoming addicted or dependent on Oxy. The doctors have told me that 10mg is a low dose and I should not worry about addiction, but I just want to check with experienced users to make sure. I've been experiencing a runny nose a lot of the time, which I know is a withdrawal symptom - especially since I haven't had a runny nose for years prior. Is this dose a danger for me (I know 10mg is tiny compared to what many others do), or should I just continue taking it as needed? Is it possible I'm technically addicted already, or am I just being paranoid?",1538615311.0

I know a great deal about designing analogs, reaction pathways and analysis techniques. I think my knowledge could be of service to drug users at risk. This is probably the wrong community, but the one I feel most connected to as an opiate user myself. 

If given a sample and description of expected contents, I could in most cases reasonably discern the most likely pathway of synth and thus the most likely containments, as well as cuts if I had reference standards. 

I am employed at a company and these could not work together, but with small startup cost (relative, I suppose) I could set up a small analysis facility. It would probably cost a few hundred thousand dollars for space, equipment, reagents and compliance/licensing. 

Is this of interest to the community? My aim would be to reduce the cost of getting high performance analysis from hundreds of dollars per sample to $10-30. If set up correctly as a non profit and maybe even with some outside funding, this could be doable given the cheap cost of running (solvents are cheap, the big stuff is the machines and the reference samples).

I've been pretty good about taking my daily buprenorphine but I've been getting a hankering for some heroin. Issue is, I've been out of active addiction for such a long time that I actually don't mind being alive so much these days, so was hoping someone could fill me in on how likely it is that any heroin I buy will have fentanyl in it. 

I saw a poster about fentanyl at my local CGL (which is something like a methadone clinic but for all substances), warning about the dangers, so I'm guessing it's definitely a thing here, and if that's the case I'll probably just stay away from heroin entirely. But I don't know maybe it's not as big of a problem here?

Don't get me wrong I'm not saying I'm 100% gonna order some heroin off the darknet, I'm asking as much out of curiosity than any intent to use. My tolerance is so low that some codeine is enough for me these days, I just took just under 200mg and I'm feeling pretty good.

So with my new leftover cash that I have never had before in my life, I got something I've wanted since childhood, a tongue piercing.  Feels good.

There is no point to this post.  All my old friends were addicts so I don't talk to them anymore and most people my age drink or smoke or whatever and I try to stay away from that scene for my sobriety's sake.  I wanted to tell someone though because I'm happy so I'm posting this here.  Any of you trying to get sober, remember it is possible, and when you break yourself of complete junkie status you will be surprised at what little things can bring you happiness and all the random things you don't realize your missing will make their way back into your life.

I know there are tons of people here like me where its just more I LOVE opiates, I function better on them, but no I'm not going to stick my arm in a wood chipper to get some trammies at the ER are you stupid?

&#x200B;

To be fair I have met people like the former, but they always struck me as drugs not being their primary or only issue, like they had a serious personality disorder or were on some slow emotional breakdown or something similar. Oftentimes it didn't even seem like they cared for opiates that much, it was more like a taboo being broken or something like that.

Oftentimes the so called ""normies"" who would tell tales were just as ridiculous in another direction, who the hell is still assblasted twenty years later that their kid stole a bottle of RXed cough syrup?!

I have a question regarding kratom use as a mode for getting clean. Through my research i have found that there are quite a few strains if kratom that each come with different effects and are used for different things. My question is, which strain of kratom is best for getting off heroin dependence and why is that strain the best. Which strain contains the most opiate alkaloids? And finally, what is the best dosage for that strain in order to curb withdrawals entirely in an individual with a high tolerance (using a bun of decent- strong H per day for 3 years and previously 5-10 oxycodone 30s for 8 years, 1 year overlap using blues and h together then strictly H alone). Thank you so much to anyone who answers, i appreciate your help very much. I have subs but i can't begin to list all the reasons i hate using them and i really really want to use kratom instead so please refrain from telling me to use subs because I'll dismiss it from the start, I'm strictly here for kratom advice, nothing more nothing less. Thank you so much again, in advance. God bless you all and i wish health and happiness to you all, members of the best subreddit going.

Ok so I woke up with a horrible hangover and went to my purse to mix up my morning shot. I’ve had cotton fever before and normally it takes a second to kick in, before the needle was out of my arm I felt myself starting to vomit. (TLDR, not a cotton shot, used a fresh q-tip to mix up, clean rig, etc🙄)

I ran to the bathroom and started projectile vomiting all over everything. My whole body felt hot and I started sweating uncontrollably. I threw up until there was nothing left and bile started coming up. I tried to lay down but couldn’t sleep, my body kept alternating between horrible sweats and chills. 

I got up to throw up again and decided to mix up another shot. I was shaking and sweating so badly that every time I got a register I fell out of the vein. I kept trying over and over again, finally got my hands steady and dry enough to push in the shot. 

I went to lay down in my room, brought a bucket because I was still throwing up. It didn’t help right away, but eventually the shot got me to the point where I could just fall asleep. I felt better after sleeping for a few hours.

**first:**  some homeless guy sat down at the bus stop with me and just started talking about his heroin use out of nowhere, unprovoked.  nice guy, though.

**second:** some guy in the city park was actually advertising.  which like never happens here.  he hit me with a ""got clear and black"" as I was walking past.

**and third:** some guy I saw outside the needle exchange this morning ran into me at the train station, like 8 hours later on the other side of town, and chatted me up for a cigarette and offered to help me score.

like what the fuck?  nothing nothing and nothing for five months and then out of the blue it's like a triple whammy in one day.  like is this a sign that it's my time again?  why today?

I didn't ""start"" with anything else because my initial ambition was to end my life (I figured ODing was the best way to go). I bought 10 bags off the original Silk Road and got them in the mail (strangely, the guy I got them from was later part of the case built against the guy who ran the site). I snorted half a bag before I decided to ""pull the trigger"" and within 5 minutes knew that life wasn't \*nearly\* as bad as I thought and I wouldn't have to die (so I guess I have heroin to thank for saving my life).

But later I combined all the bags thinking I would make up some big solution that I could take bits from, I accidentally took too much MDMA (also from SR) and needed to ""calm down"". I was extremely spun out on MDMA so I took probably 6-7 bags worth of heroin and ""shot up"" (I had 0 experience shooting up at this time, so I probably didn't even hit a vein). Still, the only thing that happened was I puked a lot. I didn't pass out or anything.

Since then, I have never overdosed or come even close despite intentionally trying several times since, using dope that someone else ODed on, quitting and then coming back, etc. I live in California and soon after the silk road I started copping it off the streets of SF and SD, so with the exception of the stuff I got off the silk road, everything is tar if that makes a difference.

&#x200B;

I've read since then that almost everyone who ODs is actually taking Xanax or Alcohol along with their heroin but it seems like plenty of people OD ""normally"".  For those who have ODed - will I be able to feel it coming or will I just pass out immediately? Has anyone else been ""congenitally"" incapable of ODing?

No that isn't the lighting btw it is definitely bright purple. 

So neither of my plugs were responding today. Most likely because it's a blizzard up here in Canada currently. But I didn't feel like taking my usual daily dose of methadone and just wanted some opiate buzz whether it was heroin or fent. 

Proceeded to go downtown and walked by the homeless shelter because there is a bridge and under the overpass sometimes guys hang out to get picked up for construction job for cash jobs. But also corner boys hang out occasionally though in my city there isnt much of an open air market anywhere at all. Asked a few people and there was weed, benzo presses, crack and coke but no down ( I usually find down can be the hardest to find and acquire). 

Next I went by city hall because people sometimes deal around there but also only tek/meth. This is where I remembered I have been to the safe injection site once or twice before. So I headed over there and there was a group of people sitting down on the stairs at the church or like community center across from it that looked sort of rough. 

I asked the first girl I saw that looked probably the roughest out of the guys and girls in the group. Immediately ahead said she had some but I would have to trust her to go around the corner with a plug that was on the other side of the street. At this point I was obviously a little hesitant because I never let the money walk with anyone or trust anyone in this kind of circumstance on the street because I have been burnt for a few hundred a couple times for doing this. So I just said to her hey I will trust you but I'm only going to do 50 dollars not the 100 I originally stated which she was cool with and understood. I also gave her 60 throwing her 10$ because I could tell she had a rough life on the streets and probabaly needed it alot more then me and was helping me out. Also I could afford to get burned for 60$ if it happened. I also threw her a hoot to have on some foil as a measure of appreciation since she got it instantly and it was a fat couple bags. Was definitely the barney the dinosaur purple fent that is going around but thankfully for fent this stuff actually has reasonably long legs and doesnt only last an hour or two which is what makes fent so unappealing.",1538520037.0

The problem is because the bags are huge and I've grown a tolerance, 4-5 bags is equal to like 10 thirties in powder probably, and that's what I am at now (at first I was only doing 2 bags a day).  I try as hard as I can to do without nasal spray, so my nose is ALWAYS clogged and I can barely sniff it up my nose, its a mess and its annoying but its life as an addict I guess.   Up until a week ago my nose would be able to be blown out completely to the point where the mornings were the best sniff bc it went right up and by night it would be fully clogged but now its always clogged.  From the second week and on, there's been various nights with blowing out blood.  Since a few days ago it is now not clearing up enough to snort easily in the morning, and my nose is basically clogged the entire day.  I shined my phone light up there today for the first time and it is all scabbed and yellow and weird looking, I hope its not infected.  One side is worse than the other but both sides are fucked up.  Needless to say I am still trying to get it up there because I have bags left.  This shit DEF cant be smoked and I don't shoot so that out of the question, so are there any other ways to take it?

 I guess this is a shitpost but man it feels sooo fantastic got a G of some fire #3 for 30€. This dope got for sure about 60-80% purity. Great to have a new plug after I deleted all old numbers. I will just chip today and tomorrow cause tomorrow is my free day and I just wanted to be high. Man its so great to feel this feelings again. I feel like I could do anything that I want. In my country is winter now and its freezing cold but with dope its not as cold as without. I know that I will not use for more than 3 days in a row but I also got 3.5gs of some pure afghan incoming from the DNMs and I used that stuff before you just snort about .1 and then I nearly nod the fuck out for about 2 hours straight. I hope this time chipping will work better and that the 3.5gs will last for this month cause my car is broken and I need to pay a few grands for it to get fixed. I was clean for a month now but I only could barely sleep in thr night and today and tomorrow I know that I will sleep like in gods bed. Normally I would go and get on mdone or subs but here in germany you will lose your drivers license if you are on maintenance. So I cant cause I need my license to get to work to pay my bills. Amd also to have a opi adventure every few month or weeks. God knows how long I will live but I know that I will ever come back to heroin untill I get a kid. Cause if I ever will have kids amd I want to I will be sober. Just to be at least the half like my dad, he was such a good father. Sadly I never told him before he died. But we didnt had to talk about such things. We both knew it. I remember one of the best 3 years when he drove me 3 times a week to my training and we talked all the time. He watched me playing standing there proudly saying things like: "" Look this guy is my son!"" I sadly never had the chance to tell him my feelings cause I woke up to my mom screaming that my dad is dead in their sleeping room. I tried to revive him but it didnt work. I gave all I can and much more. I was willing to sell my sould to the devil just that he could live. But thats live and I learned to live my life with PTSD and mental problems like depression etc. and I know everytime he looks down to me he says:""Look thats my son! I am so proud of him. Even if he makes mistakes like doing dope for 2 years straight. But he has such abgreat soul and is so lovely amd trys to help everyone!"" And I am just the one I am because of him raising me like he did. He said that there will be assholes on this world and it may look like their life is better but never be one of them. Life will throw many rocks at you even ones that may kill you but you have to fight like he did amd then he said that if you will be a good person you will get a reward of it for me its my two wonderful sons and my wonderful life. I know I drifted a bit away and this post may have no real point but I learned today again if you keep fighting then you will get a reward of it. My depression got so much easier for me in the last 4 months since I am sober ( I just used for one week after 3 months and then decided on my own that I need help again and got clean again with the help of my doctor) I can laugh again and I am much more happier with me and my life. I just wanted to say while I am high and yes I know this is double moral but if you ever need help or just someone to talk to who knows what a loss of a family member or friend feels like then you can PM me everytime of the day. It may take a bit untill I answer since most of you guys are in another time zone but I will answer and try to help you. Stay safe fam.

I register quickly in a small vein down the side of my ring finger, and I know I'm supposed to take the tourney off NOW . But the vein was so small and shy, and I feared it would disappear upon loosing the tourney, plus I would have had to let go of the syringe; which is very hard because you have to hold the syringe in a certain angle


So I shot up. No pain or anything, the rush was diminished but came in full force when the tourney was off. My finger vein looks ok if slightly bloated, I think that if I keep rotating and give that finger a rest for a while, it'll be available sooner rather than later


Sorry for the blog post, my question is essentially: How  dangerous is it to shoot up before undoing the tourniquet? I got a slightly swollen vein and a histamine reaction (which is par for the course). Do you always take the tourniquet off first and if so, how do you undo it? I have a medical tourney which has a plastic lock. Biting doesn't really work tho...

Thanks for reading all that, and let me know your personal tourniquet rules and protocol.",1538483362.0

God bless the TGA. There is a push by certain “doctors groups” to ban a certain popular, OTC cough syrup that contains a certain opioid..

Before we all rush out and clear the shelves, it’s not Dihydrocodeine! 

Despite pushing for the ban on codeine, they’ve stubbornly refused to upschedule our beloved Rikodeine. 

Apparently there’s a push to ban pholcodine (an antitussive found in many OTC preparations) due to it causing a reaction with some of the muscle relaxants used during anaesthesia. 

There have apparently been some deaths on the table and serious adverse effects during surgery due to this interaction. 

I plan on having a chat with the father in law over the weekend to get his thoughts, (he’s an anaesthetist) & see if it’s overblown or a legit concern. 

But yeah, if you’re going in for surgery, don’t take pholcodine apparently is the takeaway. 

I don’t know why you would, it’s basically shit for a high, but ya know, harm reduction and all that. 

Not sure if anyone cares, but I thought I’d mention it. 

Let’s just keep the DHC abuse on the down low and not be obnoxious dicks about it, lest it come to the attention of the fun police we overgoverned peasants call the TGA or some activist politician (or worse) doctor.

I’ve been off and on opiates for about 5 years now. Used for 2 years nonstop. This last run was 6 months. First tried opiates when I was 15-16. 

Right now I can’t bring myself to do anything, even with kratom. Work is an absolute chore now and I used to enjoy it thoroughly, and I can’t even bring myself to play video games while at home. All I do is browse Reddit, watch YouTube and smoke cigarettes. I’m incredibly depressed, and everyday the urge to go back to dope is getting harder to fight off. Sure it won’t cure my depression, I know that. But at least I’ll be productive. At least I’ll be content for most of my day.

Anyway. I really feel like maintenance might be an option for me. I’ve used methadone and suboxone a few times in the past, never prescribed. I liked them. I’m only 25 and I just didn’t know if I’d want to be on them for the rest of my life. (I feel like I will, I feel like my brain is wired for opiates) 

What I’m worried about is never being able to get a painkiller prescription ever again if I do get on maintenance.  Also anyone that’s been on subs or methadone, what are the long term effects of maintenance? I’ve heard shitty things. Also SSRI’s are completely out of the question. Already been there.

This dude got arrested with serious weight last spring, among the many other charges they throw on you(intent to sell, weapons, prescription without prescrition blah blah) Was sure he was in prison but apparently hes out and still slanging. Dude literally lives a quarter mile away from me, had some dope within 10 mins of texting him. He charges a lot(small town far away from any major cities) but that's expected and the quality is on point. Now Im sitting here smoking some tar and I'm fucking hyped. And to make it even better, right after I scored, my mom messaged me telling me a government check(that i didnt think i would get) just arrived for me with just under 2k. 

Now here's hoping to me chipping for the next few months and not falling too hard down the rabbit hole. I actually think my dealer being expensive is actually pretty good because I'm a cheapskate so I hopefully won't be buying too much/building too big of a habit. Happy nods guys!

 I've saved 4 people's life who surely would have died. Two have 2 kids, one has 3 kids and 2 more adopted from Rwanda and the Crimea.  The last has 4 kids.

The incidents that were overdoses likely won't happen again as they've been clean 9 years thru 2 kids.

All have families. None of us do anything spectacular or special in terms of careers. I resent the business world and get backstabbed by the person I just busted my ass to help them not get stabbed.

The survivors I helped work middle class jobs kids don't shout about during career day.

I probably won't have kids, even though I'd love to. I'll die poor. Probably leaving more in my will than ever had in life.

I've been blessed. I've been lucky. I am a junkie. I cry every few days from the sickness and despair.  Only a dream job seems the answer, except everyone who is lucky enough to,get,theirs, realizes that wasn't the answer either.

So ill keep getting hi selfishly.  I don't see a reason not to. Society will still suck balls for all my years of trying to change it. So I'll keep remembering I've done something positive and worthy while here.  Ill ignore the mass of voices screaming it wasn't enough, you didn't make enough money.  You spent too much time enjoying life while money and power got away.


I'll keep ignoring them. I'll keep wondering if people know there's almost a dozen kids to build the future because I stumbled into that space and time. Even when others were there still asking if they should call 911, I already was in action.

My counselor at outpatient and my probation officer told me that's probably the only way I could legally do a taper.

Talked to the nurses who were all completely understanding and non condescending.

Talked to the doctor for like 5 minutes... He started with ""most people can detox safely cold turkey without the risk of seizure"" which made my heart start to sink... Before following it up with, ""but usually in situations like this we just write a script for a few days worth of Valium to help you through the worst of it... If I was in your shoes, that's how I would prefer to do it, so I'm more than happy to help.""

That was after I had been open and honest with honest about unsuccessfully (and illegally) trying to detox myself in the past, and my history of opiate/heroin addiction.

So 30 mg of Valium a day for 3 days...

I’ve been using Kratom everyday for over a year and never have I once almost died from it. It has a similar safety profile to marijuana in my opinion and Kratom is extremely beneficial in my everyday life in multiple ways. Drs are now afraid to prescribe opioids to people who need them and they turn to heroin that can be potentially laced with Fentanyl. Most opioid related deaths are from a combination of CNS depressants and ignorance. Why should the responsible drug users be punished? I’m pissed off at this whole situation. ,1538431353.0

I got my gp to give me a final script of 10 mg Percocet 3x/day to get me through figuring something else out.

I tried many times previously to get my pain management doc to either put me on methadone or suboxone but they refused (I have serious memory problems and taking something thrice a day is completely unmanageable for me).

So my shrink is a suboxone prescriber and I have an appointment there tomorrow.  I've been searching this sub and Google but I'm not finding any real ideas as to how long I'm going to have to be withdrawing before I can actually take a sub.  I've been on essentially the same dose for 15 years and have no idea how long it takes me to go into withdrawals (that memory thing again - sometimes I don't even realize I'm withdrawing because I honestly can't tell the difference between that and a regular shitty day).

Is there a rule of thumb for the number of hours between your last dose of oxy and first of suboxone? I'm sure they'll explain everything to me at my appointment but I'd also like to know from others experience rather than *just* the clinical side.

I also have heard subs are far worse to get off of than the Percocet itself.  Is this true?

As a side note, fuck the government for making chronic pain patients go through this shit.  If something other than opiates worked for me, I'd be on it.  It's fucking ridiculous.

Thanks!

Edit:

Had my appointment.  I'm already an established psychiatric patient of his so I knew he was great going in.  Got the subs no problem and he had some choice words about my pain management clinic. 

Unfortunately, unlike my pain management clinic, I can't make use of my ridiculously expensive medical marijuana card anymore.  I'm a bit disappointed about that but I guess it is what it is.  The dispensaries here are outrageously expensive so I haven't been in a month anyway so I guess It's whatever but I'll miss having the option.

He gave me a script for ten days to start.  I looked at the next appointment card the receptionist gave me is for 14.  Luckily I've got a bunch of Percocet left anyway so I'm not worried.

 I went and bought another steak bake for myself and passed him again and he called me over. 
""your not police are you"" 
I laugh and say no and followed with I'll make it worth your time. He said how much you needing. I say I'll probaly get..5 to a g. He says get me half a G?

We stop at a pharmacy and he picks up some pins and we head to the dealer. He leaves his bag in the car and heads in about 10 mins laters he's back with 3g 2 for me 1 for him and I let him keep the change.  We head to a place so he can shoot. He's not got much veins left so he shoots In his groin and I smoke some on foil. He comes back In the car and pretty much passes out thought he was gonna od but he came too 5 mins later. Getting conversation out of him was hard on the way back but we shake hands he let's me know where he usualy begs and we part ways.

He didn't short me. He didn't run away with money he was a real nice guy. His phone was broken so I said pop into my shop sometime I'll see if I can fix that for you and I said I'll see you around.

My situation - I'm lucky enough that I work from home, but my job is still very demanding (9am - 7pm every day).

My habit - Relapsed 2 months ago and quickly ran up to doing 210mg/day of oxy.

&#x200B;

Last time I quit cold turkey off 150mg/day, it was absolute hell for 6 days. Couldn't work at all. I'd like to avoid that.

Yesterday, I drastically dropped my does to 90mg (taken all at once in the morning).

This got me through work. I didn't start feeling WDs till around 8pm last night. I took 5g of kratom and went to bed.

I'm going to do the same today.

My plan:

&#x200B;

Days 1-3 - 90mg in the morning / Kratom at night

Days 4-6 - 75mg in the morning / Kratom at night

Days 7-9 - 60mg in the morning / Kratom at night

Days 10 - 12 - 45mg in the morning / Kratom at night

Days 13 - 15 - 30mg in the morning / Kratom at night

Anyways lots of pain.
Florida laws now say doctors can only prescribe 3 or 7 day supplies of any opiate pain killers I don't think the law applies to terminal ill I didn't think it applied to post op either..
But when I left the hospital they only gave me a 3 day supply of 10mg oxy..
They kept asking me in the hospital if the medicine was working I kept telling them no.. They said they would adjust my meds.. I thought they would up it to 15mg.. Instead they just gave me 10mg and told me to take 2 every six hours. Smh. And I guess hospitals are only allowed to give 3 day supplies
.i had my first rehab session yesterday and the therapist was like that's all the medicine they gave you what the hell that was a major surgery..
He actually left a message with the doctor today about it.. I left a message too and they havent called back... It's fucked I'm hurting bad.. And only have 4 left..

So this is just a warning to anyone in Florida that is thinking of going to a doctor and trying to score or whatever..
I have abused shit on the past...
Amd was on a very vee low dose of sub before I got hurt.. So thebu first day those morphine injections they gave me a lost did nothing..

But yea fair warning... If your going to a doctor in Florida..

I guess they wanna increase heroin od deaths or something

I have been spending a lot of time thinking about way that legalization would help society, unfortunately I have hit a roadblock in my thinking. a few months ago while my weed dealer was out of town I made the stupid decision to try a synthetic cannabinoid sold at a local corner store. Although it is not the same as heroin addiction it did grab a hold of me and cause some pretty big waves through my family, I have since stopped and have been off of it for 3 weeks now.  Anyway it really changed my perspective on legalising and controlling all substances.

I believe people have a right to do drugs

I believe people have a right to pure, and clean substances

I Imagine a world where access to drugs and drug rehab programs are equal 

I imagine strict penalties for sale to minors

&#x200B;

I have come up with many ideas on how this whole thing could work out in a very socially responsible way, but because of my recent dabbling in  ""addiction"" I feel this is not something I have any say in, just like seeing a bunch of men advocating against abortion, I really have no say.

&#x200B;

how do anny current or recovering addicts feel about this

If you have any questions about how I imagine regulation would work please ask, I love discussing my ideas but there are alot of them and im not going to wright out an entire bill if nobody wants to hear it.

The war on substances that are addictive is important, unfortunately it is not working.. and in an ideal world these drugs would not be accessible at all, but that will never happen. but does that mean we should stop fighting it???

I rolled over and smoked a cig layin in bed, then took a few hits of some fire buds out of my bowl, and then a few fat dabs from my portable vape while I took a shit.
Once I was fired up, stoned, and cleared of the drugs I ate for dinner last night, I blew half of a 30mg oxycontin.
The day went on, I smoked about an eighth of marijuana over the course of 2 hours (4-6pm), and I preceeded to meet up with a few friends.
By 8pm I was outta my house and met up with a couple buddies at another friends crib, where one of my friends had 4 more 30mg oxys with my name on them.
I immedietly split one in half and swallowed it, and the other half was ground up and insufflated.
The next oxy I attempted to break in half also... but it broke messily into multiple pieces!!
I took one of the larger pill chunks and freebased it off some tinfoil I reused through the night. The rest of that pill snorted.
Next oxy was broken in half perfectly, and so  one half was ground up while I swallowed the other, then I waited.
It was about 12am when my buddy grabbed a gram or so of some 'white girl' he had lyin around and so I had to mix some with my oxy and of course I freebased it..
Another 20 mins after that one of my other buddies pulls out some 10mg adderalls.. so we all blew one of those before finishing off the white.

So, where to start..! I (26F) have been on opiates (oxycodone/contin) for like 5-6 years. Started off really small, got really big, now at like medium use- compared to before. I spent the last year or so very slowly tapering from my high of 330mg/day to now about 80mg/day. At this point is just maintenance to be able to function properly in my everyday life w out being sick or too tired. SO, I’ve been in this great relationship for a while with this great person and just found out this weekend that I’m about 4 weeks pregnant. My first glaring thought is I need to get off opiates like yesterday. I’ve read so many different plans for tapering down that it gets overwhelming, and bc I’ve tapered very slowly over the last year I was hoping someone could give insight on the FASTEST way to taper off right this minute while still being able to function. There’s no way I’m continuing this habit while pregnant and turning into a fucked up statistic. My bf and I both have really good jobs, just bought a  big house, have great pets, he has a great family, and  yada yada so on and so forth, and I just want to eliminate this secret dark cloud that follows me around. I’ve been wanting to quit all together for quite some time now, and this just puts the fire under me more to get it totally gone and out of my system forever and ever.

Ran out of dope and the sickness was coming on... took 3 scoops of kratom and a Valium and could just muster the strength to leave the house...

I try signing up at a methadone clinic but am informed the process takes weeks. So I head out in search of homeless people...

I pass by a few people drinking beers in the AM outside a pharmacy-- and recognizing those pinned pupils, straight up asked them if they knew where to score 

The dude I first approached directed me to this LOVELY woman across the road who I offered to buy a bag in return for pointing me in the right direction. She says she isn't greedy, and calls up her connect and tells me I can get 3 for 20-- telling me in her junky days the third bag wouldn't have been mentioned on the sly, but she's on methadone and recovering. 

Within 10 mins of meeting this woman I had her number, 3 points for 20 and met the connect and got his number too

Couldn't have gone smoother or have occurred at a better time -- and I've never cold copped in my life. The product is QUALITY afghan

They even told me never to approach certain people or avoid certain areas because the middles there would rob me in a heartbeat

It's so sad that some of the nicest souls are the ones that go down this path-- this woman just wanted to help me out for nothing in return, because she felt sympathy seeing me rattling.

It was greed, not sympathy or love for addicts that broke down one element of prohibition. It was greed that got the beloved oxycodone RXed for every damn thing for a decade. Your hook up or Dboy ain't slanging because he loves spreading nods in the world, he is doing it for greed.

If we wanna fight drug prohibition we need to show what a lucrative field it is for profit, not wanting pity and sympathy.

9kcyfc,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9kcyfc/full_opium_extraction_method/,12,https://redd.it/9kcyfc,moxycodone,Full opium extraction method,"Materials you will need:
- pot
- 3 1 quart mason jars
- Coffee filters
- Blender
- Dehydrator 
- Spoons
- cheese cloth

Once the poppies have matured and spread their seed they are ready to be used. They should be drying out and turning brown by this point and I pull them and put them in my dehydrator at 30C(86F) for 1-2 days to ensure they are fully dry  I include the roots, stems, leaves and pods basically the whole plant.

This is why I don’t just score the pods and scrape the opium in this process you get all of it from the whole plant, giving a way higher yield. Once all the poppies are dry throw them in a blender ( I used a magic bullet small amounts at a time) shred it till it’s fine and mostly powder, but it kind of rips apart stringy so it won’t be fully powder. 

Throw all the poppy grounds in a big pot and cover enough water to have it all floating like a inch above the bottom and stir it till it’s a saturated.  Turn the stove up to medium and bring to a simmer ( now here’s where the cook starts be prepared to focus and work)

Keep the pot simmering and stirring constantly for 4 hours no less i would stir every 2-3 minutes and add water every now and then to keep the water level good or else the poppy will start to burn and ruin you’re opium. Once the 4 hours is up strain the mixture through a fine mesh into a mason jar and cap it make sure to squeeze out all the juice trying to get everything out. Cheese cloth will work for this coffeee filters get jammed to easy at this point. 

Put all the poppy ground back into the pot fill with water and do a second pull but this time only do for 2 hours, squeeze out as much juice as you can from ur poppy grounds then throw it out. You should now have a jar full of dark brown opaque water  
Filter it through a coffee filter again into another mason jar I recommend doing it in a funnel because it makes it way easier. It should be very slow filtering and stirring constantly and replacing the filter every now and again helps it not get clogged.

Filter it one final time into the last mason jar then pour all of the water into a clean pot and simmer the pot down until there’s not a lot of water in the pot be very careful not to evaporate to much or it burns, sticks to your pan and ruins it.  It should be very thick dark brown liquid now at this point  pour it all into a glass dish and scrape out as much opium as you can from the pot the more you leave the lower you’re yield will be.

Put the glass tray in you’re dehyator or have a fan blow on it for 1 day and it will be mostly dark brown opium at this point if it’s still to stick to touch then let it keep drying. Once it’s dryer form it into a ball and let air dry for another day, it should now be black and look like bth this is you’re opium.

Refining the opium further:

You can dissolve the opium in a small pot of water and boil it for 20 mins then filter again and evaporate it down again and re dry this and it will then be great for smoking.",1538365342.0

IV’ed myself, that is. I’ve always got my best friend to do it, was too scared to do it myself. I’m not a daily user, I was heavily addicted to OxyContin (the old CDN formula) and Fentanyl patches from 2007-2012. I got clean in 2012 and was clean for 5 years (!) before I had a month long relapse. I’ve been mostly clean since November of 2017 and have used maybe a handful of times while I’m on sub maintenance. 
I found Hydromorph-Contin last year and fell in total and complete love with it. Maybe bc it had been so long since I had used anything, but the first time I snorted it I couldn’t believe the feeling. I loved it, and continued snorting it until I got busted by my mother and got kicked out of my apartment by my best friend because she was “worried” about me. So now I live at home again and it fucking SUCKS trying to sneak around and use once in awhile.
My other friend, not the one I lived with, was into Hydromorph HEAVY and was shooting it multiple times daily, and I had never IV’ed before but I wanted to feel that amazing rush again-and I wanted to see what all the fuss is about in regards to IV’ing Hydromorphone was. He begged and begged me to not do it, he refused to use a needle on me until one day when I knew he was sick and desperate. I bought us the pills and told him he had to IV me, and he finally agreed. 
Oh. My. Fucking. God. We had Narcan on standby, and he was super diligent about sterility and made me use alcohol wipes and a hot compress and all that jazz. I was literally in heaven for 4 minutes, I never knew it could feel that way. I get it now. I understand why people say to never start using needles, it just feels too good. We did it maybe four more times, and I just couldn’t believe how amazing it was. But he left, moved 8 hours away to get clean and restart his life. I’m happy he’s getting better. In all my years in this life, I’ve never met a sicker addict. 
So the point of this? Last night, after two weeks of not using anything, I used a needle and shot myself up. I had obtained a 24mg Hydromorph-Contin and prepped it according to all the things I’ve read, seen, and heard. I was nervous, but not really. For some reason I felt a sense of calm and control. I didn’t tie off, I put the needle in my left hand and pulled back-omg I’m in! I continued, but was too scared to do the full dose so I stopped. Holy shit, I can’t believe after all these years of opiate addiction and recovery, I used a needle on myself and it worked! 
Now that I’ve done it, I have to step away for awhile. I instantly wanted more after that initial amazing rush wore off. And that’s not a good thing. I really didn’t think I’d be able to hit. I’m happy I experienced that feeling, it was like a sense of peace washing over me, and I don’t feel peaceful too often. 
Sorry about the long-winded babbling in this post, I’ve been lurking here for quite awhile and have commented but never posted. I have no one to confess my exploits to so I figured I’d get it out here, one of my favourite places on the Internet with people I identify with. You guys are all awesome. So thanks for reading if anyone did.

I wanted to started a dedicated thread about this topic.

I am an occasional opiate user and have been for about the past 20 years. My use has always been sparse and I've never developed a habit. I used to snort h a bit in the early 2000s before the fent came along. Later on I've had some medical procedures. Since I have a high pain threshold I'd usually just hold onto pills for later recreational use.

I want to get a opiate high again. What's stopping me is reading about fent. I've read stories of ODs from snorting a single bag, which was inconceivable 15 years ago. The same with pressies. I had a friend recently OD (he survived) from eating what he presumed was a pain pill.

So I wanted to get a small amount of h and smoke it from foil. If I did it, I might be able to get it from a safer source, though of course we never know.

Simply put, is it safe to inhale a hit of h? Thanks.

I have anger issues that only become more destructive. The one drug class I’ve never indulged recreationally are opioids. 

I don’t really have access to them beyond street heroin, which is off limits for me. Beta-endorphin doesn’t do nearly enough to produce a high. I guess I’m unsure how to acquire pills without theft as getting them prescribed is harder these days. 

What are pills like? A friend of mine described it as having an orgasm while dropping down on a roller coaster.  ",1538324742.0

I was abusing them bucally, two at the time. Bucally.

Then I decided to extract one and IV it. Well must have done the extraction very well and you do not absorb all the fentanyl bucally. Or it slowly absorbs bucally, compared to that IV all in in the second. Or the buccal bioavailability is lower than what wiki says. W/E

So, i extracted this fent patch for IV use. (DO NOT ASK ME HOW TO DO IT, I COULD VERY EASILY GET PROSECUTED IF YOU DIE SO I WILL NOT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION). 1 (yes, one) patch. IVed it all. Must have fell down. Later woke up not being able to move or see for half an hour. Also I did not know what happened and was terribly confused. After half an hour I could get up from the floor and walk to bed, but my vission was still completely fucked up (could at least navigate the flat, using a screen was impossible, could not recognise icons, start bar, nothing. Did not vomit. Did not have headache. But because of how I fell I had my whole body in pain (like somebody would beat me).

edit: 100 mcg/hr patches
tl;dr dont IV fent patch if you are used to them buccaly",1538323631.0

Beth’s car runs a few spots over from right in front of my door.

The wipers move lazily. Water droplets bead the window and slide down the exterior of the car. Exhaust blows out the tailpipe. Beth and Sal are screaming so loudly it can be heard through the rolled-up windows which makes me not want to get in, but it’s the only way to move up in the game. 

I go back into my room and get on my belly to reach under the bed and grab that dirty piece of steel under there. Again, it is cold against my stomach and heavy in my waistband. The gun makes me miserable, just having it, and as I turn to lock the door on the way out, the neighbor lady’s door is opened. She still wears the black garbage bag for a skirt but this time with no top. From the dark insides of her room, she asks me to tell Hank that she loves him and cries on her bed.

“Okay. Sure.” I shout and move towards the running vehicle. 

The screaming has stopped, but it’s obvious things aren’t going well. I get in the back seat. Beth wears gold hoop earrings. She bites her lip and puts it in reverse. Sal is looking straight ahead. He folds his arms and hasn’t said anything for several minutes while she sways her head every time she shifts in the old Civic. She’s being dramatic. No words are spoken until we get outside of some shops with apartment buildings up top in Chinatown. We’re just a few blocks from the Pinball museum. I know where it is, because it’s one of the first things I was ever invited to do after I got sober, but just like that Mariner’s game the kid invited me to the other night, I never went, but I did walk by it almost every day to and from work when I was a valet. 

Anyway, Sal has his hands in his hoodie belly pocket. He looks at me. His eyes are lucid. Beth wears a brown leather jacket with all kinds of buckles and tighter jeans than normal. She clutches her bag behind us and steps with an angry, chemically induced swish. Her heels clack on the pavement. She’s wearing sunglasses.  

“Guess, it ain’t all Chinese in Chinatown, huh?” I say.

“Guess not.” Sal says.

Beth is quiet as Sal presses the button up to whatever apartment his man is in and we wait. Rain drops fall. It’s chilly outside. The door buzzes, and we walk up two flights of stairs to a bare concrete hallway. Asian music plays through the wall. The singer sounds lovesick, and the strange smells of foreign foods waft through the building. Apartments are small up here, and it’s warmer than it is outside. Sal takes us to the last door by the window looking out over the street, and he knocks. Feet move across the floor. The chain unlatches from inside. 

A small woman looks out and beckons us in. Inside there is a small Vietnamese man with a white tank top on with windbreaker pants and a pair of black slippers. He wears a jade Buddah on a gold chain around his neck. There is another gold chain on his wrist. The 30 something year old man sits at the table with a several full-sized sandwich bags holding large pressed pieces of dope. He smiles excitedly and holds his hand out,

“Oh. So, you Sal’s boy, huh?” He tilts his head back, like he’s inspecting me.

“Yeah. This is the Junky Vonnegut.” Sal interrupts.

The man ignores Sal. “My name is Thahn, but you call me Tony. Okay?” His accent is thick.

“Okay, Tony.” I say.

He is beaming, ignoring Sal completely. Beth sits on the couch with her legs crossed. One foot kicks. Her arms are folded. Tony’s woman or whoever she is has gone back into the bedroom. She uses a mirror in her lap and folded cards to deposit small amounts of white powder from a pile into the small wax baggies I’ve been selling. Every so many, she wraps them up in a rubber band. I know the number is 14. 

Tony tries to address me as Vonnegut but says, “Runnyket, I sell for my father. We have much more. We want sell more, now. You sell for us?”

“Yes,” I smile, “I sell for you.”

“Okay. Very good. I have everything you want. No problem.”

“What will you do for 7,500?”

“7,500? You not messing around Runnyket.” 

“It’s what I got, today.” I act cool as if I know what the standard amounts are for that kind of money but am just waiting to see if the deal he’s cutting is any good. 

“7,500?” He pronounces each word with a long, skeptical whine. His voice is low. “7,500 Runnyket?”

“Yes. 7,500.”

“Okay. I give you deal, man.” He sits up and speaks louder. “Half pound. Good deal, man.”

I figure in my head that’s less than 1,000 bucks an ounce. For the quality and price I know one of those little baggies will fetch, this deal will make me rich. Beth stands up and announces that she’s going to the bathroom. Sal sits on a recliner in the dark corner focused on me and Tony talking. He looks at us sideways. He bites his nails. The mechanism on the doorknob clicks as Beth shuts the door behind her. I pull my money out of my pocket to count out five 100-dollar bills which I keep and toss the rest on the table. Tony picks it up and counts it.  

  A minute later, he says, “Okay, Runnyket. Take.” He hands me eight of the sandwich bags on the table, one by one. “Okay?”

“Sure. You have a bag?”

“Yeah. Rose. Get bag for Runnyket!”

The Asian lady who let us in gets up off the bed, sets the mirror down on the mattress and walks into the kitchen. She leans down and opens a door. She hands me one of those reusable fabric grocery bags you can buy at the store for a couple of bucks. I load the ounces into the bag. 

The sink is running in the bathroom. It’s been going for a while, and there’s a loud thud from inside of it that causes the glass in the apartment to vibrate. Something’s wrong. Sounds are funny like that. When they’re serious, you know it. Like when you hear someone’s skull split open on the pavement or the way a person screams in crisis or just the sound of a body falling to the floor in a way that’s serious. You can’t mistake it. You know something’s wrong. Maybe, it isn’t so much the sound itself, but the absence of any sound or movement on either side of the sound that makes it obvious. No sounds of getting up signal my subconscious that it’s not just no big deal. The water’s still running. That’s it.  

Sal jumps up and opens the door. Beth is laid out like a wet dishrag on the floor. She's sweating. Blood runs from her arm and neck. It looks like there’s a gash in her head from the fall. An uncapped needle rolls across the floor. Sal grabs her bag and digs in it.

“COME ON! COME ON! Where is it?” He says frantically. “HERE!” He holds a naloxone nasal sprayer in his hand and leans over her face to administer it. Sal slaps her and props her head up. “Come on! Come on, baby!”

Tony and his woman are staring at the scene with their hands on their waist. Sal finds another plastic nasal sprayer and holds it in case the first one doesn’t work. Tony leans over and asks him,

“She live?”

“I think so.”

“Good, Sal. No more.”

“No more what?” Sal asks. He sounds irritated. 

Rose has walked over with a wet towel in her hands and wrings it out on the overdosed girl’s face. Beth moans. It’s this very dramatic and ungraceful vocalization that is pitiful to watch and hear and makes me realize how much grace Beth has always had. She’s lost it since she stared using so hard, and that is hard to see. A web of spittle hangs between the lips of her open mouth on the floor, and she moans again. There is the unmistakable smell of someone who has defecated on themselves in the apartment.

“No more, Sal. No more business, man. We finish. You go to Runnyket, now. Runnyket sell you.”  ",1538293251.0

I've recently gotten a bottle of 20mg/ML Oral Morphine and want to shoot it.

Read \[here\]([https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=89777](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=89777)) that if it's NOT generic, then it's safe. I don't know what mine is

Quote:

\>  **two primary forms of an oral morphine solution, the brand-name “Roxanol“, which tends to have flavors and sugars, etc added, and the generic which is made by Roxaine Laboratories.**

\> **The defining difference between the two is what is in the solution. The generic explicitly states ' No sugars, NO Alcohol, No additives.**

\> **If your bottle does not say this, find a new route.**

\>**Injecting the sugars and additives can cause MAJOR problems, as in fatal. Not to say the other is safe, but that's the only one I chose to consume and can report usage with. Also the Roxanol tends to come in white plastic bottles while the Roxaine Labs generic comes in a dark brown glass bottle.**

&#x200B;

My bottle indicates:

\>Blue Solution Clear Raspberry

Other:

Bottle is PLASTIC, not Glass

Brown Colored bottle

Provided by an HMO known for preferring to give out generics.

This time they attempted the same, but needed to use an I.V. as well. (As told to me by my family.) From what coworkers are telling me, this is a severe state. Her mother keeps going away to events and parties while leaving her alone at home, while her father works and gets really angry when he is told to stay and watch her. (So he doesn’t) They both refuse to admit her anywhere because of cost. I want to know if there is anything I can do anonymously to help, because people are telling me that she will die. If not I’m fine with stepping in without the anonymity, but I prefer not to. No one, including myself knows anything about Heroin or drug abuse at all. I don’t want to lose my cousin.

Why it even took that long to come to that conclusion, or why it came to me in that peculiar moment, I don't know.  Regardless, I was out of dope and withdrawing, and I badly needed the dopamine burst. I wished I had never gone to New York at all. I wished I had not relapsed. I wished I could shoot up in peace and maybe do too much and never come back. My misery was back like it had never left.

Let’s go back in time a few months. The relapse was not a sudden thing, I had planned and expected it. Around the time I had reached one year of clean time I began using kratom every so often, then weekly, then whenever I felt like it--giving up on the hope of being disciplined about it. Then around 14 months, I had no qualms with helping myself to the my girlfriend’s roommate's pain pills in the bathroom cabinet. I had also began to frequent my online drug forums again to read the stories and relive that life second-hand. I was bored and was missing the exciting part of all of it. So, like a Catholic priest at an all boys prep-school, there was temptation all around me and simply a matter of time before I indulged my hedonistic tendencies.

The apartment I was living in was nothing more than a basement with a mattress. I told my family that I was having a hard time deciding on how to decorate the place. But the real reason for the barren home was that I didn’t care to spend money on furniture and posters that could have otherwise been spent on dope. Any superfluous purchase was dope out of my pocket. So, like any dutiful drug addict I had to take that into consideration every time I spent money. The result was an apartment with a dirty mattress and top ramen.

Closer to my relapse, I had been given the opportunity to visit New York City with my father for the first time. Up until my 20’s I had never been anywhere besides the west coast, except for a brief stint in Colorado. I was accustomed to black tar heroin--the gummy, vinegar smelling substance because it was all I could get where I lived. Ever since I saw Pulp Fiction, I always had this idealized view of East Coast heroin. Heroin in movies was never tar, it was always a light colored powder, I found it sexy. And knew that regardless of my clean time or lack of clean time, I would indulge myself  if given the opportunity.

I jumped at the chance to go to New York with my father. He told me I’d be on my own most of the time since he was going there for work, on a business trip. I would have to explore the city by myself for the most part. I was fine with all this.

I had progressed a great deal over the course of my year or so of clean time. I had a great job with a fantastic company, I was very fit and strong, most likely in the best shape of my life, and was on good terms with my friends and family--as evidenced by my Dad’s invitation to go on this business trip with him.

So, eastward we went. And due to a lucky circumstance, I got upgraded to first class on the way from California to New York. The trip was starting off great. I was super excited to experience the East Coast and was looking forward to all that lay ahead.

We arrived at our hotel in the financial district on Wednesday night. We were staying for four full days and would come back on Sunday. The first day I went out into the city after my Dad left for work and just walked around. I did a little sightseeing and took a few photos. Got some good food from the food carts and had an enjoyable day walking around. For dinner I went to Shake Shack downtown and after eating I got on my phone and got to business. 

There is nowhere in the country I’ve been that I haven’t been able to find heroin with either craigslist or other means. I scrolled through the posts on New York’s craigslist and soon discovered some of the slang used for dope there. Dog food was one that isn’t as common on the West Coast but seemed fairly popular in NY. Many of them were clear scams but there were a lot on there and I ended up messaging about 10 different posts. 

After that, I hopped on Tinder and was pleasantly surprised to see that I was seemingly in high demand with the women of New York. I got several matches right away and many more through the entire trip. Now it was the waiting game. I had cast my sex and drugs net out and now I would wait to see what would catch.

Fast forward through another relatively boring day of sight-seeing by myself and I was beginning to get responses on both the sex and drugs front. By then I was chatting with 6 or 7 women, and 3 or 4 alleged drug dealers. I won’t go into the process of how, but I’m pretty well versed in identifying veritable drug dealers and those who are either cops or scam artists. By the end of the second night there, I had my search narrowed down to two drug dealers and two women, all of whom were willing to meet.

My first choice in drug dealers was a guy who went by Rook and was located around Harlem. I wanted to go through him to get the dope but he ended up not being down to sell me such a “small” amount. I wanted $100 worth of it, at most. I obviously didn't have much of a tolerance due to being off heroin and was only in NY for a few days anyway. I was not willing to bring drugs back on the airplane with me. I have done it before and  I didn’t want to go through that headache again.

So I resorted to my second choice, Ted. I could tell the guy was black and it was clearly a fake name, but that’s reasonable. He was down to sell me the amount I wanted and he said to hit him up the next day anytime after 2pm. He was very clearly a little suspect of me and  he seemed worried that I was a cop myself; all of which, by the way, were very good signs that he was indeed legit. I was pretty certain this was some low level dealer or, more likely, some sort of middle-man. 

Ted gave me the general area of which we would meet. It was in Brooklyn. Cool, I have always wanted to check out Brooklyn. I looked up the cross streets on Google maps to get an idea of the neighborhood, and I was a little demoralized to see that the area was the straight-up motherfucking projects. Just like from all the drug dealer movies I’d seen. Ugh. Fuck. 

This is going to turn into a whole thing isn’t it? I thought to myself.

Im overwhelmed by the support i got from you guys so shout out to all you guys and gals your all awesome, this community really is great. So this is a bit of an update i guess.

Anyways so i had a long discussion with this girl ive been dating almost a month now who i ended up using with. I explained that i have an addiction to oxy and any opiate substance really. I told her i should have been way more upfront about my problem and that it wasn’t her fault. She felt extremely bad for putting me in that situation and as someone who doesn’t use regularly she feels awful. I explained there was a lack of communication on both are sides but ultimately the decision to use was mine. That i don’t want her to feel like shit over my screw up and that it really wasn’t her fault, and i honestly believe that i’m not just telling her this to make her feel better. So we basically broke up and i feel awful, she really is a great girl and even though we haven’t know each other too long there was a real connection happening. She made me feel something for the first time in awhile after my last relationship that was purely ruled and run by addiction, it was just like going through the motions. But ive convinced my brain that i cant be around others who use because ill never get clean because i know thats whats for the best. Unfortunately my heart feels otherwise.

So she ends up texting me explaining that she really likes me and cares about me. She wants me to get clean and still feels bad about everything that happens, in the 1 month ive know her she has a way of always making me feel better about things. She told me that everyone makes mistakes and that you gotta keep on moving on, but that she wants to stay with me. She promises me that she wont use any drugs anymore if thats what it takes to be with me. She has never lied to me of given me any reason not to trust her.

So my issues is i really like this girl, i know it’s probably for the best that we split up so i can stay clean but at the same time this girl is really great. Should i really be risking my chances at sobriety on a girl ive only known for a month but who makes me really happy and i do care about just because she says she wont use anymore? Do i give her a shot? Idk guys im really lost in the situation and i would appreciate some opinion, i think i know what the right thing to do is but its damn hard.

Big update: Thanks for all the advice and support my opi fam! Ive decided to continue the relationship. I know i still have a lot to work on but im hoping that i can atleast be happy. This girl obviously really cares about me and i dont wanna through away the first glimpse of real happiness ive had i months. I really like this girl and i wanna make it work, i only pray she keeps true to her word, but I realize that only i can control my own urges and actions. Thanks again to everyone who took the time to reply, wish me luck!",1538250992.0

We get him out the door with his food and 5 minutes later I go to take a piss and he's fallen out on the bathroom floor, head out the front of the stall.  I tell the manager and he comes to see, manager drags the body out of the stall and the needle falls out of his arm and that when I nope out of there (not a user) and get someone to call 911 and the paramedics and cops come. They bring him back in the back of the ambulance and he's screaming and fighting the cops in there. A lot of people would have left him there, a lot of my coworkers won't even use that washroom because creepy shit is going down in there all the time. I've seen people just regular sleeping in there all the time so it wasn't that out of the ordinary for me. For a second I thought about just leaving him there and acting like I never saw him. How long until he died? 10 minutes? He didn't seem too happy to have been brought back. I guess I'm just rambling. I wish people wouldn't do drugs in there. There's a fucking safe injection tent just down the street. I was a week dry from booze (my DOC) but now I'm drinking some beers to try and forget about that whole thing. ",1538246403.0

Anyways, 

Next week I go back to my psychiatrist who has me on .5 mg of Lorazepam twice a day, and while it helps, I feel like it doesn’t help enough. And you know what, to be 110% honest, it’s also because I just legitimately want a higher dose. I’m not looking to be prescribed 6 milligrams a day, I just really would appreciate 1mg twice a day. 

So with that being said, I was thinking of just being honest— telling her that it’s working but not enough and that I think 2mg/ day would be better. The reason why I am a little hesitant is because she knows I used to do dope and that I am an addict in general, and I really don’t want her to be like, “Is it really because you need it?” Type shit. So what do you guys think? Because at this point I’m going through those 60 pills for the month in 10 days, and I fucking hate doing that because when I NEED them I don’t have them.

This morning I’m supposed to meet Sal’s guy.

He said 10 last night, so I’m up early. Do a shot. Smoke a cigarette and run to the bank. This is me going all in. I’m taking the money my grandmother left me out of the bank. When there’s something I know I shouldn’t do and don’t actually want to do, when I’m about to be stupid, my mind does this thing where it just goes blank. Like, it knows how to walk me to the ATM outside of my bank. My brain remembers the pin number and how to operate the screen. It tells my feet how to get back to the motel, but it doesn’t think about what’s really going on. My mind somehow pushes out the painful reality, the sickening thought of going back on my grandmother’s will for me and the money she left me. It was sort of a joke when I told you that she didn’t want me to spend it. I mean. That was a slight exaggeration, but she’d throw a fit if she knew I was about to take that 8000 dollars and use it to buy a major amount of heroin. I am coming up today. Today changes everything.

As I get back to the room and walk through the parking lot, there’s no movement. No body outside. No cars running. It’s just silent and dismal under the sunless sky, like time’s inertia got frozen still somehow and stuck in the grey crystal of this moment, because outside of the trap motel, outside of every trap motel all across America, it’s always the same. Hard. Miserable, and everyone is looking to come up.

Well, I got mine, and I’m holding this huge wad of bills in my hand inside of my pocket as I get back to the room. There’s this sign on the door, though. It’s taped up and the words are scrawled onto it pretty poorly. I’m guessing some boys from middle school wrote and left it. It reads:

Hey Dill Hole,

We know what you been doing. Stop it. Or we’ll get you.

The reason I say that middle schoolers wrote it is because I can’t think of anyone who would ever address someone as dill hole that wasn’t in middle school. Shoot, that probably ends in fifth grade. Anyone still saying dill hole in sixth grade must be a special case, and so, I don’t really know what the letter’s about, but I’m doing all kinds of bad things. People are getting hurt. I think of Beth and her daughter. Lives are being ruined mine included, and I just came down from all that meth. There’s a dirty gun under my bed. Paranoia is still lingering, as I open the door and walk into the room. My intentions haven’t changed, though. I’m still going to buy a lot of heroin. Sal is taking me to meet his man in a bit, and just like that, a horn is honking outside.",1538208944.0

As I was giving it to him I asked him if he was able to score boy. He said yes and I offered to buy him some as well. We walked for a little while towards the spot and he asked to use my phone. I kept my guard up but he was an older man and I’m a fairly big guy. After he hung up he asked for the money to go grab it. I was hesitant about breaking that rule but I was only getting $20 worth so I was okay with loosing that honestly. I’m also not physically dependent as of now so it wasn’t like I was withdrawing. 

I give it to him and he runs around the corner of this building and a minute later returns with a cap. He gives it to me and we walk to an area that we can both use. While there I meet another guy who this homeless man knew. I’m introduced to him and after I do my stuff and get to know him I take down the new persons number. Both the homeless guy and the other person I met are pretty alright people, I may not know them well at all but I get good vibes from them. I mean shit the homeless guy could have tried to rob me if he really wanted too. 

So anyway some time goes by and tonight I call up this new guy since I couldn’t find the homeless man. We agree to meet up and he said he knows someone who can get what I need and I tell him I will give him $10 out of my $50 in total to get what he wants. Once I get to him we begin to walk to this dealers place. We make small talk and I offer him some cigarettes. I ask him if he’s seen the homeless man and I come to find out that he made it to rehab! Was not expecting to hear that but was honestly happy, good for him. So we finally get there and there’s these two black dudes outside, ones on the phone trying to arrange some shit and sounds kind of pissed off over money and the other dude has us go inside to wait. 

We walk in and there’s a guy playing madden on an Xbox one, a woman and some guy both also sitting there waiting to be served. It’s a little awkward honestly but we just sat and waited.. you know how that goes. Finally the dude who was on the phone before walks in, still on the phone but begins to serve people. It’s our turn and the guy who was middling for me gets it and then turns to show it to me to ask if it’s good. I tell him yeah I’m cool with it. It’s in a small little baggie and it seemed like a decent 40 for where I’m at. Wasn’t in a cap like last time and where I’m from it’s usually in plastic bags tied up or wax bags. 

I decided to introduce myself to his plug and the first thing he says is “you ain’t a cop or nothin’.” I think to myself it probably would of been better to ask before haha but whatever. I say no and show him an old track mark from when I used to shoot up. He’s like “ight, you want my number?” And of course I’m not going to miss this opportunity.. the guy middling was cool with it too he didn’t even care. I get the number and he tells me he’s got Molly too! I don’t really do Molly often but that’s good to know fuck it. 

Anyway I left and me and the dude went separate ways home. The stuff I got isn’t that great I can tell it’s pretty cut but I got like no tolerance so I’m still decently high. It’s better than getting beat. The cap I got the first time was better but I’m still happy.",1538208686.0

So a couple of days ago I wrote About trying to cold cop without much succes And was asking for tips.

Well afterwards I tried cold copping again. In the morning actually.
I was packed to get to work, being a technician I work in Many places. 

Arriving in The city at 7:30am just to be sure I was there first, I called my boss to ask for more detailed information About the job he gave me Intel About the previous sunday. 

So my boss being a fucker, didn’t respond at all, even though I could see him online on whatsapp.... I waited around for two hours until I said “fuck it Lets get some dope.” 

Walking around a few districts And talking to a few homeless people without succes, I found this dude looking at me, like he was trying to talk or offer something. 
So Yeah he was a dealer, offered me Some crack to buy but I Told him Im not into that speedy short-lived high. 
I asked him: “Do you maybe know Someone who has/sells Some brown?”

You have to understand that this dude was pretty drunk And fucked from other shit, he behaved pretty happy And proper Nice tho.

This dude tells me he knows Someone who sells Some brown. We called him And were going to meet up.
But fuck. His mobile was empty so there was no getting any dope.

He was actually a Nice dude, had Some unresolved things perhaps, but I look beyond those stereotypes And cloaks. 

In the end we just got a little drunk And later in the day ate Some food. We were chilling in bars, cafés, coffeeshops.. any fun place.

He didn’t want to help me get brown anymore, because he actually didn’t like seeing me on the street in the future. Because he had seen it happen before, with his friends.

He Also Told me his background, which was, compared to me, a whole lotta worse... Where i felt depressed About shit not working, he made motivation to just keep going And going And going.. his mindset was extraordinary. 
But with his background I understood why.

This all had me thinking a lot the last days, About whats important And how to do it.

Tl;dr:

Went to work, tried  coldcopping. Failed but made a valuable friend who made me realize important life lessons.

My girl got pregnant 8 weeks ago and there was never a discussion on if we were having the baby. She took the first test with her mom and she basically told me we were going to have this baby. I didn’t have any time to think- I was overwhelmed- but I love this girl and it’s my responsibility so I started manning up to prepare for it.

Over time we both grew excited, picking names, talking to the baby and planning our lives out. Her family even made baby clothes. We were all Happy with what was to come.

Last week we got into a small disagreement about something relatively trivial and she seemed very distant since then.

I could feel the distance so gave her some space while reassuring her that I love her.

Today she told me that she is going to have an abortion. I’m for a woman’s right and everything but I have to say I feel violated and I’m absolutely devastated. I’m praying with every fiber of my body that she changes her mind. Ive never felt so sick or hurt in my entire life and I’ve been through some hard shit in my life.

I imagined a life with her and this child and I feel like my heart is crushed. I don’t know how she’s going to feel about me after the abortion. I still love her even though I’m hurt really bad right now. I don’t want anyone but her, and I want my child. I love that baby. It has a heartbeat.

If god is looking out for me I just pray that she changes her mind because I want nothing more than to be a loving father to that child and a loving partner to her.

Bad sets include: nicks, cloud 9, 50 cal, and bananas

This dope has k2 in it that greatly overpowers the dope. If you do a normal amount, enough to feel the dope, you’ll basically overdose on k2 and be like out of your mind fucked up in the head lol. If you do like 1/30th of a bag you’ll just feel really stoned but obviously won’t feel any of the dope (which is actually all fent). This shit is making people sick and causing atypical overdoses that don’t completely resolve with narcan cause obv narcan doesn’t work for k2. [This article](http://www2.philly.com/philly/news/philadelphia-overdoses-heroin-fentanyl-k2-kensington-20180923.html) touches on the issue but doesn’t make it clear that this shit is still ongoing like the dope is still bad.

That’s all the main important info, but if you’re curious, the back story / details of what and how I know are as follows:
Starting last Friday I was seeing and hearing way more ambulances than normal around nicks, and by Saturday I assumed there was a bad batch going nearby, but I didn’t realize it was nicks because I was still seeing tons of people pick up from them which I thought wouldn’t happen if it was bad, and I hadn’t tried it myself cause I was detoxing for a few days in preparation to see my PO. But as I was leaving Sunday morning, a guy I had met down there told me not to grab nicks because it had k2 in it, that he shot it and felt like he smoked k2. I had already grabbed 6 so I was like eh whatever I’ll just be careful and test out a tiny bit first when I do it. Get home and google k2 in dope in philly and actually find an article saying 50 people overdosed over the weekend and they believe the shit was contaminated with k2. Next day my friend hits me up and asks if I have 2 she can buy off me. I hadn’t tried the ones I had yet cause I still had to see my PO so I said yes and gave her 2 but warned her what the guy told me about the k2 and showed her the article. And she was like yeah my friend actually told me not to get this or 50 cal cause they were making people sick. But she basically does the same thing I was planning on doing and says whatever I’ll just try a little first and see what happens, and she has me there to take care of her if anything happens, also had narcan on me just in case. So she tries a tiny bit and says she feels fine but then she’s about to do the rest of the bag and is like “actually things do look kinda trippy.. weird.. maybe I’m just hungry. You know how things get weird when you’re hungry?” And I’m like uh no not really I don’t think u should do the rest. But she does it anyway and then gets fucked up like as if she smoked way too much k2. She said it was like a bad acid trip and that she didn’t even want the second bag. I watched her for an hour trying to reassure her that it would wear off soon and brought her some water and shit cause I felt bad that I gave her bad shit. She had to call out of work. This was Monday.

I didn’t want the rest of the bags after knowing for sure what would happen so I went back down several days later (yesterday) to get new ones and hopefully find someone that might actually want the ones I had, like someone who likes k2. I picked up a random girl panhandling to see if she might know anyone who wanted them and she said no one would intentionally buy them, and I said I’d even do half price or less and she still didn’t think anyone would want them. She said everyone is avoiding that whole area cause all of the sets have k2 in them right now - she got 50 cal over the weekend and woke up in the hospital, left and grabbed bananas instead and woke up back in the hospital in the same day. So I just threw them out. Since it was almost a week since this all started by then, I figured they must be through the bad shit by now, but before I went back there I asked my friend if she had copped nicks since the whole k2 incident and she said no but that she knew people who did and said it’s good again. So I go back there and grab 2, and the stamp is changed to “cloud 9.” I’m like cool so hopefully that means they got totally new stuff all together and didn’t just change the stamp due to it getting a bad rep. The powder looked different than the stuff that I knew had k2 in it, which was reassuring. Regardless, my tolerance was down from just having detoxed for a week or so, and I still wanted to do a test amount just in case, so I mixed the bag with 30 units of water and pulled up only 1 unit to shoot. Thank god I did it that way cause I instantly felt stoned as fuck, like I felt high on WEED, like I felt like I just did a fucken dab lol. I haven’t smoked weed in years so I was pretty nervous esp after all the bad things I heard about these k2 bags but I ended up being fine, I think because I only did 1/30th of a bag. I felt so high from it that if I had done a whole bag or more like most people probably did who got sick, I would have been out of my mind like hallucinating the way you do when you smoke way too much k2. I got lucky in that it was actually kind of enjoyable but unexpected and unwanted. And I wasted more money on k2 dope.

This shit is weird, not sure why people would put k2 in their dope but hopefully it stops soon. Be careful out there!",1538172488.0

Before Sal gets to the room, Ed knocks.

He wants 100 dollars’ worth and is asking if there’s any kind of deal. I hand him seven bags for the 100 and let him know that if he comes back with money, we can work out something more consistent. Ed gives me a fist bump and runs out of the room excited by the information. Then, there’s an obnoxious banging. I know that’s Sal. He comes in, and Beth follows behind him with her arms crossed and head down. She’s different than I’ve ever known her to be. Quiet. Sullen. There’s makeup on her face, like I’ve never seen before, mostly eye stuff and lipstick. Her nose looks green and swollen under the powder.

“Whoah! Man! What the hell is that smell?” Sal’s eyes twist. He speaks words laced with ethanol vapor and takes a seat at the little table in the corner.

“You don’t want to know.”

“How can you stand it?”

Like everything else, the dope, the meth turning my mind into mush, the hallucinations, the gun under the bed, the paranoia, the smell was really hard to take at first, but now, I’m used to it. “I don’t even notice.”

“Don’t notice it? How’s that?” He extends his good hand and arm to Beth. She slides over to him and sits in his lap.

Sal has pulled a bag of what I’m guessing is cocaine out of his pocket. He pours some on the back of his hand at the base of his thumb and snorts it, does it again and snorts it with his other nostril this time. Then, Sal pours another one and pushes Beth’s head to it. She snorts. He pulls her back by the hair. She holds one nostril shut and inhales sharply.

“Well, it’s gross, yo. So, what you need?”

“400 bucks is what I got.”

“34 plust 34 is 68. So, I’ll give you………………"" It takes him a minute. Finally, Beth whispers into his ear, and Sal continues, ""Five bundles. That’s 70 bags.” This deal is not as good as the last one. He’s doing coke, though. What do I expect.

“Sure. Whatever.”

Sal counts them out and tosses them on the bed. I hand him the 400. Beth has still not spoken or looked at me, even. I feel bad for her.

“My boy wants to put you to work.” Sal shakes his head. “I wouldn’t give you up, but he says this is how it goes. You know what I’m saying? I told him how you were doing with it. So, he bought me out. Now you’re gonna have the hook up yourself.”

I nod and look at Beth, again. What happened to her daughter?  “Sounds good. What time?”

“We’ll be by at like ten. Right?” He raises his voice, so Beth understands that’s how it’s going down. “Yeah. Ten. Good?”

“Sure.”

Beth never says anything to me. She never looks at me. They leave, and once they’re gone, the whole thing hits me like a depression. I ask myself how much I contributed to putting her in that situation, and even though I was never particularly fond of her child, I feel grief for her, too. This is the life. All that crap you see in the movies or read in books about how cool drugs are is just that. Crap. Keith Richards is an anomaly. Mostly people don’t live as long as he has, and what’s more, we’re not rock stars doing junk. We’re junkies doing junk. We’re slaves. Even when we we’re on top of the game.

I'm sure I am fine, i just wanted to know you guys opinions on today's concoction., This has occurred mainly due to my chemists, and my plugs.

This morning I had 400mg of Codeine phosphate, yep a little buzz of it, nothing spectacular, this was around 10am'ish. 

This afternoon I had 15-20mg of Methadone not really much from that buzz wise, this is 2pm.
And just now I've finished of with a snort of 2-3mg of Subutex, now I know this isn't going to put me into withdrawals as I don't have a habbit. 
Will it just kick the other stuff of my receptors and then the buzz will be purely from the subutex?
Also I'm quite confident with my tolerances and aware of the boundrys etc. And mainly I ask does anyone think I'm taking to big a risk. I'm sure I'm fine as other than the codeine phosphate the doses are relatively small.

Where do you think kratom stacks up in comparison to other opioids? Not necessarily in terms of pure strength, but more so in your own personal preference. For me, I would say it is somewhere right under oxycodone and above codeine and hydrocodone. I know that will sound weird to some of you, but the kratom effects are significantly more euphoric for me than hydro (which mostly just makes me drowsy) and also 100x less itchy. And codeine literally does nothing for me.

If given the option of either popping a Norco/sipping some lean or taking some kratom, I'm going with the kratom every time... throw an oxy or a morphine on the table, and it's a whole different story.",1538146367.0

It would be impossible to overdose on a codeine if there ever was saturation.

1. Get back 450$ worth of my favorite stuff out from the pawn shop.
2. Pay the 4 traffic tickets I have received since I moved to this new city 1 and a half months ago. All being my first traffic tickets ever.
3. Return 300$ to my moms account before she notices I never actually did what I said I would do with it.

I hope I beat this thing. This is me going all out.. I'm nervous as hell to leave the country on my own and start over without the heroin and fentanyl and dilaudid... I've quit longest one month when I went to my first rehab. Day after I got out was shooting up again. 

Have cut my use down from 200$ a day to 40$ a day but yesterday and today I spent 120 a day on it.... Putting me back on the money I need drastically. No job BTW. Other means of making money.

My dad used to take me to flea markets before the divorce.

Once I moved back in at 15, he didn’t go to them anymore. Well, he never took me after that, anyway, but when I was little we went to one where they had this table all devoted to smaller home appliances. There were microwaves and toasters and mini ovens and that kind of thing and then there were three waffle irons. Well, when I opened one of the waffle irons, it had pieces of batter stuck in the square grid crevices, like whoever owned it before was giving you a little piece of themselves with their waffle iron. It was gross. I showed my dad, and we laughed so hard that other customers laughed, too.

I have similar imaginations about the gun I just bought. They’re not funny though. Seriously, I hate it. I’ve washed my hands several times since I’ve been back in the room, trying to get the invisible grime of whatever heinous things it has done off my hands. What kind of implications does it carry for me just having it in my possession? What terrible things has it done? Has it killed? It’s become this massive worry in my mind that my whole life revolves around, and when I think about it, it’s like the waffle iron at that flea market. The same way there were bits of waffle batter left in the griddle is the same way I imagine pieces of someone else’s brain and blood or hair are left in the gun. Maybe, a tooth is lodged in the barrel somewhere, but I’m too scared of the gun to look. I don’t even know if it’s loaded or how to load it or how to shoot it. It’s stupid for me to have it, but it’s under my bed, now. It’s part of the ride I’m riding, the life I’m living, the death I’m dying, whatever you want to call it.

I do a shot. Shots of heroin make my problems go away. Shots of heroin also make more problems for me. That’s why I’m where I’m at now. Heroin addiction is funny like that. While I’m rushing, Sal calls.

“Where you at?” He asks.

“In the city.”

“Oh yeah?”

“Yeah. Where else?”

“In a hotie or what?”

“Yeah. Got a room for the week.”

“Aight. Aight. Cool, man. My boy said he wants to meet you. Said he wanted to know who’s selling so much for me.”

“Cool. I was going to call you anyway. I need to re-up.”

“Alright. I’ll stop by. Give me the address.”

“Sure,” I say, “Room 127 at the L\*\*\*\*\* Motel and Motor Lodge. Knock when you’re here.”

“Oh. Yeah. Beth’s coming, too.”",1538110678.0

I ended up trying H tonight.,"Today i fucked up, i had almost 2 months sober off of a pretty bad oxy addiction and a smaller xannax habit. I went to a party with this girl ive been dating for about 3 weeks now. It was our first time doing something super social together like this big party. I knew that she smoked weed and occasionally popped bars but i had no idea she was messing with opiates. As an addict you can normally tell with in the first few times of meeting someone if they mess around with opiates. Stupid me thought since cutting out all known users from my life, like my plug, my ex-girlfriend, and a few using friends that i was untouchable now. Well about an hour into this party i see her talking to someone i dont know. I casually walk over and introduce myself. She asks me if i fuck with dope. Immediately i start sweating, my hearts racing, i feel gity and excited thinking back to that warm blanket that is the opioid bliss. So the guys breaks out some ECP, they cut up a few lines of some decent looking grayish white powder it had a strong familiar vinegar smell.(my ex of almost 3 years was a regular H user so i was familiar with the smell). In that moment of weakness i ended up snorting a line or two and i was back in as easy as that. That warm fuzzy coziness, like the suns warmth wrapped around me, feels like liquid gold is flowing through my blood. I felt absolutely amazing but at the same time i felt awful. I had let everyone down but worst of all i had let myself down. It happens to the best of us i suppose but as of tonight im cutting this girl off and im starting back at square one. Im gonna get out of this game if its the last thing i ever do. Took me awhile to write this since im nodding pretty hard. I had physically kicked my addiction but mentally i proved to myself that im still very much addicted and i still have a lot to work on. Wish me luck because tomorrow is the start of a new day and a new chance at getting clean forreal this time

9jiwx9,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9jiwx9/put_myself_into_precipitated_withdrawal/,57,https://redd.it/9jiwx9,Mroto,Put myself into precipitated withdrawal ):,"I've been shooting dope for like 2 months now. I was clean for about a year and got strung out again (goddammit) but I recently decided to see a doctor to get on suboxone. I dont want to stop using at all, in fact being off dope right now for a few days feels like I'm going through a breakup with a girl I really loved. I'm depressed as fuck, everything makes me think about it and want it, I feel like I will never be happy again without it, I'm in denial that it's happening, etc. 

But anyways, I'm getting on subs because some higher part of my brain functioning knows that I need to fucking stop with the heroin if I ever want to have any kind of life in the future.

I started suboxone induction yesterday. My last shot of dope was the night before, so it had been about 15 hours and I took my first dose of sub at the doctors office. I didn't feel that bad, just kind of shitty and had no energy and slight sweating.

So after a few more hours I decide to shoot the last of the dope i had saved for ""a rainy day"" in a vain attempt to feel better. To my surprise, it worked. I had only taken 2mg of subs so far so I guess it cut through and I felt alright for like 20 minutes.

Later that night I'm scheduled to take more suboxone for my induction. I am wary about precipitated withdrawal but I figure that because I did the dope AFTER the sub that the dope couldn't still be on my receptors by now, right?

WRONG

Stupid ass me decided to shoot the suboxone. I dont know why. I have a needle fetish. I had shot subs before with no problem.

Holy fucking shit.

What happened next was nothing short of traumatizing. Thinking about it today sends a shiver down my spine.

As soon as I took the needle out and felt the orange taste in my lungs I knew I had fucked up.

It felt like ice had shot through my veins and dropped down into my stomach where I got the most intense feeling of dread I have ever experienced. I dropped to the floor in agony. 

Sweat was pouring down my face and soaked through my clothes. I puked almost instantly and thought I was going to shit myself but luckily didn't. I was instantly overwhelmed by so many different emotions, shame, anxiety, soul crushing fear. All I could do was writhe in pain on the floor crying/murming ""oh my God, what have I done"" over and over. 

It was like all the symptoms of withdrawal had condensed at that moment in their most intense forms all at once. I had never felt anything like it, it was a needle full of the flames of hell. It literally felt like the polar opposite of a fat shot of dope.

I had put myself into PWD with naltrexone pills before, but this was something else entirely. I never knew pain like this existed.

I thought it was going to last for days, but thank fucking god it subsided after an hour or two. If it had lasted through the night, I would have without a doubt committed suicide.

Let this be a lesson to you. WAIT 48 HOURS MINIMUM BEFORE YOU TOUCH SUBOXONE.

It's the next night as I'm writing this, and I still feel like shit. Hopefully it goes away as i get used to the suboxone. I'm supposed to be getting the sublocade shot at day 7 of being on the strips.

I'm at 60mgs and I like it very much. Feeling good most of the day, and cravings are manageable.. iv heroin is my doc and I haven't used for over a week now.

I usually just kick back on the couch and let the sleepies envelope me while the family watches tv/goes about their business - I dont go all the way out, I'm mostly aware of what's going on around me (finances have been stressed so I'm living with semi retired mum and dad) but today I was off work and decided to nap upstairs in my bedroom around 4:30. I lied on my back same as I would on the couch, pulled the comforter up and before long I was in that familiar trance like sleep state. Then there was an itch in my brain that I could be weightless and I just began floating around the room. At first it was scary because it felt so real but soon my mind figured out it was dreaming and I went with it / surrendered and I was out the window flying around the neighborhood.

So, when I got up, ya know I was in a panic because it was close to time for being late at the school. But that wasn't the reason for my crazy-ass feeling. I was super dizzy up until around 1:00 today, like dizzy enough to walk into a wall 🤣🤣. My eyes have been blurry all day. But on a positive note, I haven't really even been going through withdrawal.

Has anyone else felt like this while taking that? Is it normal? ",1538085325.0

I agreed, and while we were on our way to pick up a pizza, he asked me if I wanted to smoke some weed at his house before we headed back. It had been a pretty slow day, so I decided to go to his house and take a slightly extended lunch. After we had smoked a couple of bowls, he pulled out some tinfoil and showed me tiny brown dots on it that he said was fentanyl.

Now I don't use opiates, I just knew this guy did them because I had a hunch he did when I met him, and it had turned out I was right. So he asked me if I wanted to see how to smoke it, and I said yes thinking that he would only show me the steps, but instead he burnt the tape off, melted it on the foil, then rolled up a 20 and smoked the line 15 minutes before we had to be back at work. He actually took it like a champ, and I just thought it was hilarious and was genuinely surprised that this guy was able to take 3 poppers and a hit of fent right before heading back to work.

I'm going to tell you a story of how nice they can be.

So my dealer put too much cut on his stuff two days ago and decreased the quality tremendously, to the point where I can either do a gram in a shot and get a somewhat recreational high or do a half gram  and just get off sick and a Lil high.

Well today I did just a half gram, but I had saved 17 cottons from the previous really good dope.

***With all my cottons I purposely leave one or two mgs of liquid and save them in an air tight container***

Rinsed the cottons pretty thoroughly giving me, yes, I know it's unfortunate but two whole syringes of liquid.

I injected one and felt pretty good, by the time I was half was done with the second injection I knew I was going to be high as a kite, and I was, and this was just after doing a bunch of actual dope.

So anyone that says saving rinses or cottons doesn't do anything is full of shit or hasn't tried it, because one day those will really help you off sick",1538081066.0

I used to IV heroin, a relationship that lasted 5 years. So weird to actually say that. The withdrawals and the actions I deemed necessary to defeat them eventually ruined my life. I went on suboxone. Twice. 

First time early on it was from fellow users, I wasnt too far into my addiction that I was actually able to stop, inside a 2 week period with relative ease. That of course gave me such a false sense of security in my abilities to simply stop. Eventually i began using again and more often. You know to the point youre scheming and plotting on how to get your next fix. To the point you are a bonified junkie  whose bankrupted all accounts with a moral deficit. Enough was enough. Again. 

The second suboxone induction (after two months with methadone) was through an overpriced doctor who overprescribed, and only discussed future tapering options possible after atleast one year in maintenence. After I lost my insurance I had to cold turkey from subs. This was hell on earth and lasted for over a month. But i did it.

however this was not enough and i went back to the needle and back to being broke. After google searching home remedies for withdrawal, I found imodium for. And fuck me, it fucking worked. How magical. I learned that high doses of generic aniti-diaherreal would alleviate withdrawal symptoms. I cant begin to describe the fucked up cycle of using till im broke then using lope till i can use. back and forth. 

&#x200B;

Fast forward two years I now take it everyday. Ive been off heroin for most of the time, live with my gf of 2 years, whose never done drugs and I take Copiuous amounts of loperamide everyday, dosing  upwards of  200 pills(400mg). This will eventually kill me. Now all that background is to let it be known that I know what withdrawal is, i felt it for years. The withdrawal from lope not only real but it is insanely agonizing and along with its long half life withdrawal can last a long time. Im done but im not in a position to cold turkey,  Got a great girl, great apartment, and shitty bills. But im done and im not trying to kill myself. 

So, Ive been ordering kratom, Red bali, been taking 10gs of it twice a day, trying to skip days i take lope and have drastically cut the amount i need to not feel sick. It seems to be working all though i have not fully committed to it. The most ive gone is two days with out lope and but have managed to drop my dose by almost 75% inside of two weeks. I just need some advice on how to properly regiment myself. ",1538075139.0

Sigh, this drug seems to have replaced any natural good feelings that were possible. I don’t care what it is I’m doing, it would always be better with opiates. I can barely enjoy being sober anymore, if at all. Which scares me. And when I am enjoying myself while not on opiates its because I’m on another drug. 

I was trying to kick my opiates habit this past month so I stocked up on benzos even though my habit isnt bad enough to where the withdrawals are anything super crazy. But then my drug addicted ass blacked out and relapsed, woke up in the hospital, all that. 

I don’t understand how people kick opiates using benzos. All benzos do for me is obliterate any inhibitions. Leaving me with 0 reasoning as to why relapsing and using opiates would be a bad idea. So it never works. I know in the end it isn’t the benzos, or my upbringing, or any other outside factor, it’s my absolute horrific self control and lack of interest in life. Even before opiates. 

I currently have 5 bars and 5 oxy 10’s. I feel like I’m rocking back and forth between saying fuck it but knowing I’ll be to disappointed in myself to even enjoy the high.  And leaving my house, getting on the bus and going far away where I won’t have access to them and keep living my life day by day hating every second of it. 

I knew going into this drug that it was gonna be horrible for me, but I didn’t give a shit about becoming a junkie. I’ve always seemed to hate life either way. I have, (or had) potential but it didn’t matter to me. I wasn’t interested In what most people consider success.
looking back on it, even living day to day at a simple 9/5, my biggest fear, would probably still be much better then whatever I got going on right now.

Last night I take two of the 15s, now this is after a whole night of not sleeping, and a whole day of running around.. so when i take em im tired as shit but still up enough to chill...I also have to mention that Im coming down from alcohol, been detoxing for about 4-5 days... SO i take the two pills and at first everything felt good, I was just tired but I was feeling decent.. Then EVERYTHING took a turn for the worst... basically had a panic attack, started throwing up, could barely keep my eyes open, started hearing voices and eventually I said fuck it and tried to go to sleep because  Iwas  trying to fight through that shit for as long as possible because I just paid money for these shits so I just thought it might be a bad trip, let me fight through it... finally fall asleep, weirdest nightmares, jumping out of my sleep, waking up not knowing where i was for a sec... now im up and I go to take a shower because im still shaky and feeling spacey, Started throwing up in the shower and now Im shaking and still feeling like paranoid. I dont know if it was just my body, or if this dude sold me a bad batch or some shit but what does it sound like to yall and have yall ever been through this? feel free to ask as many questions as youd like

I was at the trap I scored from one time and this junkie girl I was mixing up next to asked me to shoot her in the neck. At first I was like wtf?? Sounds dangerous as fuck. She said it was one of the best rushes you can get. No filter just dope straight to the dome. After I shot her, she did the same for me and god damn was she right. So I started only shooting in the neck becuase no matter how high I was I always got a rush.

Looking back im so fucking lucky I didnt do any long term damage. The amount of bad cuts (legit dr pepper is used as a cut down here) its amazing I didnt drop dead from one of those hundreds of times I hit my neck vein.

One time I was shooting in a 7/11 bathroom when the employee walked in on my with the needle on my neck. I just looked at him and said ""diabetes fuckin' sucks""

Morning is going on outside.

Another day. I dread it. I mean. Even though I’ve got all this dope and a place to stay and cash in my pocket, even though the last 3 days have literally been the best it has have ever gone for me as an addict, even so, I hate it. Every breath, every moment, every calorie, every movement, everyone of my thoughts is devoted to an enterprise that is guaranteed to kill me and destroy everything around me. Eventually, it will catch up to me. It will kill me, but here I go again, wondering who’ll buy what I’ve got. If I come up and make a profit off them, there’s a chance they’ll die. It makes me sick in a way. Even worse, my phone has a missed call from Jerry, so I pull my rig out from last night and sit at the kitchenette counter and use a few drops of water to mix the dope up right in the baggie.

It works. The stuff doesn’t need to be heated. I nod out for a while. Sometime around noon, there’s some shouting outside of my door, and so I get up to open it and see what’s going on. There’s a lady. She’s screaming across the parking lot at some random dude, saying,

“I’m not getting naked for you! Never. You can keep dreaming.” She pronounces it ‘nekkit.’

He seems as confused by it as I am and shrugs as he walks faster. The woman wears a black trash bag like a skirt which reveals one hairy leg and fat foot with jagged toenails. She is squat and very wide. Her hair is long. Long breasts hang over her belly through her shirt. The woman turns to me and asks me if I’ve seen Hank.

“Hank?” I have no idea who that is.

“Ya haven’t seen him?”

Maybe she thinks I am whoever had the room last. She should know that I have no idea who Hank is. Even if I had seen him, I couldn’t tell her, but I haven’t seen anyone. I tell her so.

“Not me. I haven’t seen anyone.”

“Hmmm….” She looks side to side with squinty eyes. “Well, do you know what he did?”

I don’t know what Hank did.

“Run off on me. Gone. I went up to see my daughter day before yesterday and spent the night. Come back yesterday afternoon, and you know what I found? You know what he left me?”

She’s looking at me. Her hands are up in the air and moving around dramatically. Those bushy eyebrows turn up in excited expectation. I shrug.

“Left me a note written on the wall. Said. Priscilla I’m done. And you know what he wrote it in?”

“No.”

“Wrote the Dear Jane letter in feces! Can you believe that?” Except, she pronounces it ‘fee shees.’ Just like that, which makes my mind wander to this old hotel handyman I knew once. He had been in Vietnam and told me about how he used to have to crawl through the enemy’s tunnels, up to his neck in human species. He meant feces. He just said species, and I guess no one ever corrected him. Neither did I, but now that I’m thinking about that, I wonder. Why are they called feces? Like, what’s plural about it? Is each particle or nugget and individual fece, but when they all get together, they become plural? “Left me the letter in his own feces?” She says ‘fee shees,’ again. The woman breaks down into a mess of tears and sobbing and walks away.

Not long after that, I see another kid hanging on the steps by his room. He’s smoking a cigarette. I walk over and ask him for a light.

“You staying in that room?”

“The room I just came out of?”

“Yeah.”

“Obviously.” I laugh.

“True. They didn’t tell you, did they?”

“Tell me what?”

“Oh man.” He shakes his head.

“What?”

“They found a dead guy in there last month. The firetrucks and police and all that was here. It was a mad house.”

I swallow hard. “What?”

“Yeah, man! Found him a week or something after he’d been sitting in there in the heat. Blew his head off and no one ever reported the gun shot. I heard it, you know? But you know how it is. None of us want the cops around. Anyway, sat there, man, in the heat just decaying, until someone smelled it and called it in. Sad, bro. Real sad.”

“That is.” My thoughts are not about the tragedy but about the sign saying no refunds or room switches in the lobby and the smell. That’s what I’m feeling sad about. “You know where it happened in there?”

“Yeah. They said it was over by the bathroom door.”

“Man.”

“Yeah. So, you know, it’s pretty crappy that they didn’t tell you.”

“Yeah.” I say and take a pull of my cigarette. “What’s your name?”

“They call me Ed.”

“Word. What you mess around with?”

“Mess with?”

“Yeah.”

“I sling crystal. I like to do me some dope though every once in a while. Why?”

“I got some.”

“Dope?” He has thick glasses that magnify his eyes so that they’re too big and a backwards Raiders cap.

“Yeah.”

“Well, I ain’t got any money on me this second. My chick’s down the street with our dude on the re-up. All I can give you is some meth.”

I move my head slowly from side to side, like it has a marble in it or something and I’m listening to it roll across the floor of my brain and then back again. Meth is not my choice chemical to consume. In fact, it makes me very anxious and has a long list of other negative side effects that I really can’t stand, but the addict in me speaks up and says,

“Aight. Sure.” The whole deal is to show him that I have something good, anyway. So, after he gives me one of his, I give him one of mine and ask, “What’s up with that lady? You know?”

“Oh her?” He motions with his head toward my room and the one next to it.

“Yeah. Her.”

“I don’t know man. Crazy. I guess. Me and my girl been here a few months. She was here before us. Always running around screaming at people about how they can’t have her, that she’s saving herself for her Hank.”

“Yeah. She said something about that.”

“Yeah. Well. I ain’t ever met no Hank. Ain’t ever seen any dudes in or out of her room. She’s just crazy.” He flicks his cigarette into the grass.

I nod in agreement and walk back to my room. He walks back into his. The day is sunnier than it has been the last two or three, but it’s got that nip in the air that makes sure you know it’s fall no matter how bright the day is and that it’s not getting warmer. It’s getting colder, now. Last year, I got really depressed about it. This year, I’m too depressed about my life and the fresh track marks on my arm to know how I feel about the weather.",1538025238.0

Really though, my #1 favorite is to listen to a few songs to get some inspiration, then hop on FL Studio and try to make some new songs. Something about the anxiolytic effect helps my workflow so much when it comes to music production, and while paired with weed, can lead to some massive creativity.

First of all, I have a tourniquet. It's got a plastic lock which you can undo pretty easily, as long as you use your thumb, which means I have to let go of the syringe and risk the needle slipping out. So far I've used the tourniquet to let the veins come out, and as soon as I can feel one, I loosen the tourniquet and go in right where I've made out the vein's location, register, and push off. Will this work with all veins though? Or do some veins just disappear once the blood flow goes back to normal?

My other question was about the angle you're supposed to enter the vein at. Should you go in as shallowly as possible? Because I've read somewhere you should aim for 45 degrees. I mean it both makes sense...

If I could kill the man who got me into heroin, I would. He's a disgusting piece of shit from New York who actually got me to spend my money to go meet his dumb ass. He promised me  life full of love and happiness and left me with an even worse addiction than I showed up there with.   


Heroin is not what I expected. I still get excited when I pick my drugs up. Still. Even though I know. I FUCKING know nothing will happen aside from I won't get sick. Even though I KNOW the chance of myself catching a nod is a distant far away dream that I can no longer reach. I still get fucking excited to pick up, despite the fact I haven't had the desired experience from heroin in probably over a fucking year now? Maybe it only feels like a year but I do know it's been months at the least and that's long fucking enough.   


How do I pretend shit's worth it when I can't even get high.   


I know most people here are like me.... good hearted people who find themselves doing things they thought they never would to fund a habit. That's so many of us. The majority, I'd be willing to bet. People say the worst about us... ""They'll steal your wallet and help you look."" Do you know how fucked up it is to realize you ARE now that person? Do you? It's so fucking disheartening. I fucking hate myself. Every day ""Amanada you're a piece of shit"", it's the first thought when I see my face staring back in the mirror. ""Amanada you should have died so many times but you're here."" I dated a man who was a few years my junior, 22 to my 24. This was a couple years ago. He was the best man I ever met. Kind, sweet, loving. He was on opiates for stomach cancer and he warned me so many times not to let the pull of opiates rip me away fully. But upon his death, I let the pull rip me apart. Everything else was ripping me apart so I figured why the FUCK not, right?? What have I to lose when the best man in my life is dead?? WHAT HAVE I FUCKING GOT???   


Well, I had a fucking future to lose. I did not see it, but I did have it.... it's right fucking here now, NOW I am here and I am LIVING IT. I am living my shit future all because I let my life go to shit. All because I wanted to self medicate. Well, fuck. This is my fault. Not his or her or yours, MINE.

“Oh you want crack?”
“No like rocked up dope”
I aint got that
“I’m good bro” i turn to leave, PISSED i just wasted 2hrs of my night and my guy calls again

“Bro nah, i wanted boy” 
“Oh aight i’ll be right back”
“Dude i cant let you hold my money”
“Shit come with me i’ll weigh it out in front of ya”
.. aight.
So we go not 200 ft round the corner to his apt, he has me wait in the staircase and proceeds to weigh up a .7 in front of me...  i was like yo thanks man... in a last-minute effort to make this dude comfortable enough with me to fuck w me, I ask him “hey man you know anyone that raps/does music?” 
“Yeah mane”
“Wel shit check me out”
I proceed to show him my music and instagram videos of me singing/rapping/producing... this way I know he’ll be thinking “okay this kid def aint no cop or a buster”

He cracks a smile at my content and we laugh about some music shit, and then I casually say, bro if you want take my number we can link on some strictly music shit”
He thinks for about a half-second and says “shit aight” 
Takes my number and as hes locking it in I say “yeah man, feel free to hit me up for beats or whatever”

Now at this point, he’s full-blown comfy with me and we’ve been chilling long enough for him to read my energy and know i’m a straight-up, bout my business mofo and he replies “man, Fuck the Migos- I sell dope, you hit me up dr0ppa, I got everything you need”

I laugh my ass off for a second cuz him saying that made my day, and I thank him and say “you’ll be hearing from me my guy, i appreciate it bro, be safe”

This happened a few months ago. At the time, I was going to my local methadone clinic, although I wasn’t on methadone, since there was a month’s long waiting list. So instead, I was put on suboxone and told I would make the switch to methadone whenever my name was next on the list. I eventually stopped going and went back to the dope game (and I’ve been using ever since, unfortunately).

Anyhow, while at the clinic for my suboxone, I would have to show up once a week to talk to my counselor, take a drug test, and pick up my weekly script of 7-8mg suboxone strips. I guess you would eventually get bumped up to monthly scripts if your drug screens were turning up good, but yeah, I think I legit passed one test throughout my few months there (Mainly just weed and heroin, as I was still dabbling with it, considering the subs did fuck-all for any mental cravings).

So each week, if you failed your drug test, as I did like clockwork every week, my counselor would show me the drug test results from the lab and I could see exactly what substances I was failing for. I mean, I already knew each time what I was going to pop for every week, but the one week, I was definitely thrown for a loop...

Now, as I mentioned, while my habit had considerably decreased once I got on subs, I was still using like 2-3x per week...it was kinda dumb to be honest, because even though I would intentionally wait 48+ hours since my last sub dose, I could still tell the little dope I was using was getting blocked and way more for my liking.

On those 2-3 days per week that I did use, I was going to the same connect each and every time. And her bags were ALWAYS consistent, always the same shit (a dope-fent mix, of course). We would know when she went to re-up and even then, it was always the same.

So this one particular week, I get my drug test back after being told I once again popped for heroin...not surprising one bit. But what was surprising were the additional substances that I was also pissing hot for...now, as mentioned, I was getting my dope from the same one spot every time so I knew it had to be from those bags. I also was 159% positive that I was not putting anything else into my body that would explain the other shit I tested positive for...

As expected, I had shown positive results for morphine (which is what heroin breaks down to in your body after use), as well as two different analogies of fentanyl (not exactly sure which two, but it’s irrelevant). Here was the huge head scratcher...I also tested hot for codeine and tramadol.

This made, and still doesn’t, zero sense to me. When heroin breaks down in your body, it doesn’t end up breaking down/producing codeine as any type of byproduct, correct? And tramadol?! I haven’t fucked with that shit opiate since like 2013. They’re whack and even if I was dopesick, I think I’d still turn my head to those if ever offered any. 

I know this post was way too long and detailed for most of you, especially since I don’t really have any point in making such a post, as it’s all in the past now.

But it still does make me scratch my head. As stated, I know with 109% certainty that I never took any codeine or tramadol pills. It seems as though the only logical explanation would then be that my connect used these two pills as her cutting agents? This doesn’t really make too much sense either, though!  While I suppose it would logically make sense to cut dope with another opiate, who actually does that? No one. There are so many powders out there that people use to cut their shit much more easily. I just don’t get who would go through the time in crushing codeine and/or tramadol pills to use for a cut. It’s just not feasible, especially when you’re selling like 15-20 buns per day, as our lady was.

Getting any type of answer or response to this isn’t really of much importance to me, if I’m being honest haha. It happened awhile ago. Like I said, a comment on another post had reminded me of this happening and I guess I just was looking for any type of insight from any of you beautiful people.

In conclusion, sorry for the absolute unnecessary wall of text I just spewed. Blame the meth, guys, not me!",1537952116.0

Mac was/is/will always be my favorite artist, and his passing hurt me more than either of my 2 year Gf breakups. Ive been onto him since before his first studio album (Song title ""Don't mind if i do(better than ""Donald Trump"" I'd say)"", 6 months before his first album). My biggest regret was that I never got to see him live, I always figured that hes young, I'll see him soon. Apparently it was an OD, but the fact that his house was scrubbed clean is leaving authorities with many questions. It'll take another couple weeks before news breaks on his autopsy about what really happened. I needed to vent because hearing this enraged me.

The lobby at the hotel is cold.

My clothes are wet again. There are 600 bucks in my pocket. That’ll get me a week and then some at this sleaze bucket motel. Besides that, though, there’s another 75 bags in my other, and the shot I did in Cowboy’s car on the way here is hitting me hard. I fade out. I wake up and fade out again. My eyes open once more. There’s a fat man at the window, renting his room for the night, and I grab one of the brochures on the rack showing the local tourist attractions. This one is about a haunted tour of some buildings in the city, and I put it up to my face like I’m reading, an inch away from my eyeballs, to hide the fact that I’m very obviously high and nodding out in the lobby.

The fat man gets his receipt and walks out the door. I stand up and come to the window.

“How much for a week?”

“439 dollar.” The English is not easy to understand.

“Okay.” I pull five of the bills in my pocket out and slide them under the window. I notice a sign that says customers need to check their rooms before paying because refunds and room changes are not possible. It’s a testament to how terrible the motel really is. I point to the sign and tell the man, “Hey, what about the sign that says you should probably get your typhoid and tetanus shots before you stay here?” And laugh.

He doesn’t understand but makes a face I know well. It’s the face people make when I’m high and they are disgusted by the things I’m saying or just the way I’m saying them and how I look. I’ve seen it lots. The thing is, though, that when you’re so high that people are angry about it, it’s basically impossible to not act that way.

“Here. Change.” He slides back a 50 and a ten-dollar bill with a few coins. “Key. Control.” He slides me the control and key under the window, too.

I nod to him and walk out. The rain is still falling. One of the lights off the side of the office illuminates the drops which look like angry insects divebombing the parking lot pavement. The key they gave me has one of those old school plastic pieces with the room number on it, 127. It is poorly cut and requires a bit of struggle to finally turn, but once I get inside, the room is warm and filthy. The maid probably cleaned it or whatever, but there are holes in the drywall and crayon marks everywhere and the mattress is so lumpy that you can actually see how misshapen it is right through the comforter all covered in fuzz and lint balls. Along the wall a strip of red carpet sits poorly contrasted with and even more poorly seamed together with the blue that covers the rest of the room, except by the bathroom. There's another square patch against the wall there, too. But worse than the way anything looks is the smell. There’s a mini fridge. It’s old and dented and the paint has chipped off in places, maybe a replacement for the last one that got left unplugged for a long time with meat in it. The smell of rotten flesh of pigs or chickens has soaked into the carpet and fabric, permanently. Nothing will ever completely get rid of the smell.

I throw my bag against the nightstand, plug my phone in and strip off my jacket and shirt. The last shot I did was so good that I nod out for a minute standing up by the bed. It’s like the feeling is warm gold running through my veins. I think that’s cliché or something someone said about it before me, but the image in my mind is of some early 90s video game character when they get like 100 gold coins or rings or whatever they’re picking up all over the place knocked out of them, but it’s the opposite. Instead of losing the gold, it’s me and I’m absorbing this swarm of gold doubloons from out of the air. That’s what I see, when I’m nodded out. It feels so good. Then, I wake up and want to watch something.

I get on the bed and grab the remote, but it doesn’t turn the TV on easily enough for me to keep messing with it, so I throw it on the floor. The other nightstand looks to have globs of dried, hot glue on it but cloudier. I touch it for a moment, before it occurs to me that it might be dried semen. It wasn’t my first thought. I don’t even wash my hands. I just nod out for the night.",1537948187.0

so me and this girl were waiting on the dope boy down the street from a trap house and the dboy is making us wait forever, constantly telling us hes 10 minutes away (red flag 1) standard dealer bullshit. while we were waiting this dude from the trap house waves us down so we walk up to him and he asks us what we want, i tell him were waiting on someone and he asks who so i told him idk the name (the dboy had given me a fake name so i didnt really bother throwing his name around) but i can show him the number and maybe hell know who that is, he said nah to that and the girl asks him if he has dope, he asks some of his associates if there is any dope and informs us that its not available but coke is, he also mentioned that he knew who we meant and that the dboy didnt have any dope(red flag 2). so we go back down the street and wait on the bench for the dboy. after a little waiting a guy comes up and asks if im waiting for his brother so i just kind of stare blankly at him when he mentions my dealers alias (red flag 3) , so i say yeah. he asks me what i want and i tell him a bundle for 45 and he says ok and to follow him into the park so we follow him and he says he wants to see the money(red flag 4) so i hand him the money. and he says something weird about his brother dying that i didnt really catch and then he says we got 5 seconds to leave. i fought him and got money back and if anyone is interested in the details let me know. i learned a couple of valuable lessons from this experience, i should listen to my gut because i thought it was sketchy to begin with that the dboy was making us wait so long, that just because someone says they know your dboy doesnt meant you should trust them,and never give the money upfront without at least seeing the product. the thing is i already know most of these rules but ive grown complacent because i havent dealt with any bullshit in a while. honestly the whole thing has made not want to dope anytime soon really,fighting could have gone so wrong and dope just isnt worth it.

I’ve been steadily increasing my dosage and realized that things are getting a bit hairy. Anyways I might as well just stop, right? Nope — headaches, nausea, chills, shakes. In short, I’ve fucked myself big time and am scared. I don’t want to die but I also need to eat, and I can’t do that if I can’t work, and I can’t do that if I’m not on dope.

So I go over to the counter and ask to purchase Naloxone. Mind you this is in a state where it is legal to obtain without a prescription. Well the assistant says she’ll be right back. But she comes back with the pharmacist. The pharmacist asks me if I’m purchasing for myself or another person. 

So maybe this is where I messed up and made them think I’m a fucking shitbag instead of someone looking out for someone else because I say me its for me. She then tells me she can only give it to me if I need it right now.

Like for real? There’s no way I would be walking into the goddamn pharmacy in the middle of the day if I were ODing. What kind of fucking policy is this? What the fuck is wrong with people? Do they want me to fucking die? A pharmacist won’t let me purchase a medicine that could keep me from dying? Why?

&#x200B;

The only connect I had was a friend of mine, and his connect was a middle. That guy only wanted to deal with my friend, so getting this dude's number for myself was not an option. So I was basically going through (at least) two levels of middle-men, and not only did I have to rely on my friend's work schedule but HE also had to work around his connect's work schedule. All of us work in restaurants so we all work crazy hours. So the working out the timing to score was a huge bitch, and would frequently have to wait a couple days. This made it very hard to prevent going completely dry a couple times.  


This inconvenience was not the only problem. This stuff was expensive, and he would often short us (most likely taking some off the top for himself, my friend tells me he was a pretty big user himself). So not only would I over-pay, I would get less than I was supposed to. Once or twice it was a LOT less.   


THEN ON TOP OF THAT, the quality was incredibly inconsistent. Many times it was great, but there were a lot of times it definitely wasn't. It was definitely cut to hell sometimes, and though I'm very stupid and didn't use a test kit there were times that the high was a good bit shorter than usual which was a red flag. The color also varied pretty much every time I would score, ranging from beige to an unsettling white. Basically it was a different experience every time and very much a roll of the dice.  


NOW things are different. I got myself a good plug, not a middle. CONSISTENCY is this guy's game. The longest I've had to wait for a text back has probably been ten minutes, and I believe that every time I have called him he has answered. I have to drive to him, but it's never more than a 15 minute drive... and he pretty much always is ready for me to come by when I call. Seriously, the longest wait has been once or twice when he told me to wait about 15 minutes before I headed over.

It's not just consistency in terms of when we can meet up. The quality is always the same. It's always the same color (I love my brown sugar baby), and the high is never short and shitty. It is definitely more pure, and it is always among the better and more potent stuff I've had. The price is much better, as well. Like almost 40% less.   


The downside is my intake has definitely gone up. Hard to help that when it's cheaper, better, and always there. For now I'm just thankful that the process itself is no longer sketchy or a huge pain in the ass. 

One love. Stay safe. Happy nods.

Got some sour patch kids for old time sake, and will try to enjoy this high as much as I can. 

Anyway thanks for all the love, laughter and support these last few years. I think the thing I’ll miss most about using is you beautiful people, truly one of the best communities I’ve had the pleasure getting to know the last few years. 

Withdrawals are going to be brutal but I’m off the next 5 days and have a hefty supply of Xanax, I’ll try and sleep as much as possible and just veggie out to some Always Sunny.

I’m posting this on my throwaway for some reason but I’m fairly well known on my main. 

Stay safe all of you. Hopefully you won’t see me around here again.

I already told my Doc that what I AM getting isn't even cutting it.  I could see remorse in my Dr.'s eyes, but was told that bc of the government & DEA breathing down their necks, they want me to at least ""try"" it for a month or so & see what happens.  I have been dealing with pain & Doctors since I was 2 years old.  I got better pain management at the age of 8 than I do now. 
      
 I feel hopeless.  I feel that no matter what I'm  doing or saying, I am just another head being treated the same as the other warm bodies coming & going from the Dr.'s office.  How is someone that's been getting pain meds their whole entire life going to be treated the same as someone who's been on them for a year or two?? 

  I cannot BELIEVE what the CDC has done, putting a blanket over everyone & their symptoms as if we all are on the same pain level.  I feel hope that at least after trying this, if it doesn't work then my Dr. will listen to me.. otherwise I don't know what I'm going to do.  I already have to find more given that I'm not prescribed NEARLY what I need.  This is disgusting America.  I would go in for pill counts & urine tests WEEKLY if it meant I could get the medication that I need.  I have nothing to hide, only yet ANOTHER pain patient not getting the care they deserve/NEED to be a high-functioning member of society.  Maybe ice packs work for some.  Maybe opioids works for another patient.. whoa re they to push agendas or judgement on a fellow human for what works or doesn't work for them.  I'm just in a state of depression & hopelessness right now.  Thx for reading& sorry if this was too much of a rant & has been repeated over & over, I just needed to tell what happened to a group that can understand.  Much love x

Or something else?,"A couple days ago I got two Roxy's and because I only have half ml syringes they ended up being 4 shots. I couldn't hit myself the first day and ended up plugging the first two shots. 
Last night I noticed my veins were starting to come back (ice binge 2 weeks ago wrecked them temporarily) so I grabbed the other two shots and did them. 
One on the bottom of my foot, and one in my arm, just above my wrist. 
Half an hour later I was lying in bed screaming and writhing in pain. I kept getting shooting pains in my pelvic area, my whole entire body was stiff and I just wanted to die. I was so cold that i managed to make it to my thermostat to turn the heat on, then I curled back up in a ball and screamed and cried all night. I was actually scared that my neighbors were going to call the police.
I did this shot at 9:30pm. I fell asleep sometime in the middle of the night or early morning and woke up noon feeling worn out but it was over.
Cotton fever? Or something else? I triple-filtered because I didn't want extra fillers in there, but I was just using those tiny cotton balls that Chicago needle exchanges give you. which is another thing. They've been in a brown paper bag since I moved from Chicago, 6 months ago. Definitely not sterile but in 15 or 20 years of shooting dope I never had cotton fever and I usually use those, so I didn't think about it.

She says she can feel it slowly coming on and increases in severity until the pain is so bad she is in tears bent over on her knees. Within a few minutes she is shaking and dizzy from the pain. It's extremely hard to watch when you cannot do anything to help. She has had them last for up to 10 hours before. Rising and falling in severity. She started getting them about 6 months ago and when she went to the Doctors last time. They did an Ultra sound on her appendix and gall bladder and found nothing. They told her it could be constipation or gas and to come back if it got worse. Well 3 months later she has another attack. It is happening right now, it came on as she was getting ready for work. And then went away. She left for work and it came back even stronger, she just got home and is sitting down rocking back and forth in tears. The pain is in her upper stomach below her breast. She describes it as someone twisting her organs up tight and then letting them go. It will slowly subside, and slowly increase. Like in waves almost. She says she is having regular bowel movements. And dosent think it is constipation. Also. The last time this happened she was taking Norco 10/325 on a daily basis. Around 30-40mg . Idk if they contributed to the issue but she claims they help the pain subside immensely. She recently started taking them again about  two weeks ago  after not taking them for some time.

He gives me a number of his favorite plugs and I give that a try, and the dude seems legit and we work out a place to meet..I drive there and call and he says that he is pulling up..2 hours go by and finally he comes through.  I jump in his car and he's driving, with girlfriend in passenger seat and one of his friends in the back with me.  Everything goes alright and I give him my money and he gives me some dope, well it's about half as much as it should be and I start saying this is going to work.  Well we go back and forth for a minute, and I never raise my voice or say anything disrespectful at all, just that what I got was no where near $100 worth.

Then out of nowhere, the guy sitting in the passenger seat just hauls off and sucker punches me right in the face about 4 times and fucking cracks my damn nose.  So I'm gushing blood and trying to get out of the car.  The driver though is yelling at the guy who punched me, freaking out on him for doing that to me.  I get out of the car and start walking away, but the dboy is apologizing and saying he didn't want dude to do that and that I should get back in the car.  His girlfriend hands me some paper towels for my nose, while the dboy is yelling at his friend for punching me..Then the dboy tells me to take this extra and actually hooks it up pretty good.

So I get back home and have to clean up all the blood, which I'm covered in and my car.  Pissed off about the situation I call the dude and bitch him out.  So I guess I did get a little more dope then I paid for but that came with a possible broken nose and swollen face, which I happily would have not received.

I just hate how these young dboys can treat people that are just trying to give them money for what they are selling.  He totally shorted me and I wasn't out of line in the least asking for him to make it right.  The guys friend was just a little punk and totally hauled off on me when I wasn't paying him any attention.  I wasn't being loud or disrespectful but they feel like we customers are all pieces of shit they can treat like trash.  Funnier still the whole time the dboy was bragging about how much money he makes and how all he dope he has means so little to him, well if that's the case why short me so bad if your such a baller?  I know I'm just venting but in like 8 years of being in the dope game as a buyer and seller, I never had something like this happen to me or done to someone I was serving.  Idk why they can't just treat it like the business it is and be professional?

Especially when the people probably haven't even done both...


Hey, guess what?

 Fent doesn't mean shit heroin newbs. If you really got fent, more than likely, actually most definitely, even more clarification, if your product is fent, it'll make you drool, face plant, throw up, and that's only after you wake up after hours of nodding without interruption or intent of ending up this way. Fent isn't shit, it isn't lacking euphoria to the point the high is not enjoyable. 



Fent is hated because it kills users unaware or reckless of its strength.


Stop saying you keep getting "" shitty fent/h mix"" and you wish your plug had just heroin.  Because-


 REALITY TIME BUD: regular, solo heroin. That which you want. That wonderful, great heroin. The antithesis of fecal fent. That heroin....is a PROBLEM!

 That heroin you want will leave you ALWAYS SAYING IT WAS A WEAK, BULL SHIT, RIP OFF BATCH.
WHY? because. It doesn't contain that ""SHITTY FENT"" you don't want. It's just heroin, and won't be anywhere near as strong. It might have longer legs, but it wont satisfy you.


You see, fent is exponentially stronger than heroin. That's why calling it "" SHIT FENT"" is ridiculous.  Any one with a fent habit struggles to just get well using top quality heroin.  


So all you newbs who keep whining you can't ever find fire clean heroin,  you never will. I guarantee you already had great heroin, but you dismissed it because you're use to fent.

I can shoot one bag of fent and miss, and it's compared to shooting 4 bags of this top quality heroin, and actually hitting a vein.

So fent isn't shitty. Heroin isn't some utopian, wonder substance. They're simply both opiates with different potency, effects, and highs.  ",1537830082.0

A week later, the test comes back, and he said he found no (listed a bunch of chemical numbers) meaning there were no opiates in the urine. Now how can that be? I know 100% it wasn't a plecibo because i was legit nodding and couldnt stop, the same way I felt from H... the same rush and everything when doing real H (I knew the shit I use to get was legit because I failed a drug test for opiates) and my pupils were pin drops. It looked like a very white tan. Like the lightest tan u can get without going into off-white territory. Also, it is pretty powdery. Like if i pour the bag too fast or the wrong way, you can see a poof of what almost looks like smoke. Very powdery but still has those classic “flat chunks” h always has, just very tiny. Could it have just been fentanyl or some other synthetic research chemical?  Will the subs even help me if thats the case? Could it have been a false negative, or maybe my body processed it super quick, or maybe my pee wasnt warm enough/there wasnt enough?? I do legit feel sick when not taking this shit but I stay “unsick” for unusually long lenths of time, like 1-2 days after my last dose then it hits me like a rock and I get crazy heat flashes, sleep is impossible, restlessness, yadda yadda yadda the whole 9 yards.
