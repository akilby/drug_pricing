He said he ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt see the appeal‚Äù when i tried to explain it to him. Granted he‚Äôs very straight edge, has never even touched a cigarette. 

Anyway, i‚Äôm clean now and my poison was heroin, but something about perc will always have a special place in my heart. I think it‚Äôs because that was the first drug i ever ‚Äúhad‚Äù. 

I was like 14? And i had just gotten 2 wisdom teeth removed and because i had shitty insurance at the time it would not pay for anesthesia so i had to be very painfully awake while they pulled my teeth and i remember feeling the nerves being pulled from my jaw and wondering why it felt like sandpaper. Anyway, the doctor felt real bad about that so he prescribed me a BUNCH of percocet i‚Äôm honestly surprised the pharmacy let the order go through. (Then again, this was 9 years ago) 

I remember coming home and my jaw hurt so bad, the doctor said i could take 2 at a time. The strongest thing i had ever fucked with was extra strength Excedrin so this really was a shock. 

After they hit me, i remember thinking ‚Äúwow, so **this** is drugs? Cool, i want to be doing that *always*.‚Äù That was the greatest 2 weeks of my life, then they all ran out üòî. I only got to do them once or twice a year when i, or a family member got hurt, or a friend would spot me.

Throwaway for obvious reasons.  I'm a finance major in one of the top 10 undergraduate business programs in the country (not trying to brag, just trying to set the stage for how out-of-place this was) and I had an absolutely BRILLIANT idea today.  Since I had an exam, I decided that I would mix the last of my dope into a large shot and bring it with me to the business school building where my class was, and boot up in the bathroom beforehand.  I've never shot up in a school building (and never will again) and I had just finished lifting, so I was wearing a pair of old sweatpants.  I walk into the building, and about halfway to my class I put my hand in my pocket and realize the rig I loaded is not there.  I check the other pocket in bewilderment, but it's not there either, and I'm SURE I put it in my pocket.

I presently break out in a cold sweat as I feel a small hole in the pocket of my pants, and realize that somewhere on the 5 minute walk from the parking garage, past the campus police station, and into the business school, I have shedded a syringe loaded with what is unmistakably heroin.  Of course I turn around and begin to retrace my steps.

At this point, I feel it is necessary to point out that the building which houses our business school is one of the newest buildings on our campus, and is basically where my school pours most of its money.  To set the scene, we're talking marble floors in a huge atrium with a giant statue of one of the famous politicians who attended the school standing in the middle.  In short, this is not the type of place where you find drug paraphernalia.  Yet as I'm retracing my steps, I spot the orange cap to my loaded syringe sitting just inside the doors of the main entrance to the building.  I'm immediately struck by extremely conflicting emotions: on the one hand I am happy/relieved to have found it so fast, and I know it must have only been sitting there for a minute or so.  On the other hand, I realize that if I can see this loaded syringe sitting DIRECTLY IN THE MIDDLE of this nice marble floor from 50 feet away, just about anyone else can too.

It is here I know that Junkie Jesus was looking out for me, because despite this rig falling somewhere it could not possibly have been more visible, which also happens to be the area of the business school which sees the most foot traffic, not a single soul walked through those doors between the time when I dropped it and when I saw it.  I mean, it could not have been any more obvious.  There is a desk where a receptionist sits just inside the doors to direct visitors and help people, and had she been sitting at her desk, this rig would have been in the middle of her field of vision.  But mercifully, nobody saw it.

As I walked over towards it, I actually debated (for all of 3 seconds) whether I needed to just leave it, because I was worried someone HAD seen it, and was simply waiting to see who would come back to pick it up.  But then I realized 1. This is the last of my dope and I am not leaving this super-dank shot sitting on the floor, and 2. There will be a fucking shitstorm if someone comes and finds this thing sitting there.  Thinking fast, I went and picked it up, and then went outside, reached into my bag, and threw out a used rig I had in my backpack as discretely as possible, so that if someone actually was looking, I would look like someone who found a loaded syringe on the ground and decided to do the good thing and throw it out.

From there, i quickly went into the bathroom, did my shot (was slightly ruined by the fear the cops were going to swoop in at any moment), and then threw out every stitch of paraphernalia I had with me or on me.  I am never bringing anything with me on campus again.

Job is going terrific. 3 places want me to work for them right now because of what I can do. My arm is infected right now from being in the ocean w a cut and I guess I got some bacteria in it, so I took the day off work. I got SO MUCH accomplished. I was just writing in my diary how good everything is going and how good it feels to get so much accomplished in one day. So many little errands that I‚Äôve been meaning to take care of. Back when I was junkin‚Äô, even if I made a fucking phone call that I had been meaning to make, I felt accomplished. Was thinking to myself how nice tomorrow will be now that I got all of this shit done and I can just chill all day and watch movies and whatever. 

So job going good. No drugs for 6 months (yay). Getting stuff done in life. Been working out like a motherfucker and feel fit as fuck. Looking really good. My best friend today also just asked me to be his best man at his wedding, something I never thought anyone would want me to do...

Also- been banging this HOT AS FUCKING FUCK girl lately... I showed one of my buddies a pic of her and he didn‚Äôt even believe I could get a girl like that. He thought I was lying. Kinda felt good man. Anyway, girl wanted me to get an std check. Now, I honestly don‚Äôt have that much sex with different people and I was just checked (clean) last year, so STD check wasn‚Äôt super high on my priorities... I‚Äôm not showing any symptoms or anything. The girl just wanted us both to get checked so we could bang without condoms. So, getting checked was not even on my fucking radar until she brought it up the other day...I was just gonna do it more as a courtesy to her than anything else. 

So I‚Äôm out doing my errands. Finish the last thing I wanted to do that day. It‚Äôs late in the afternoon and I happen to be like directly across the parking lot from the clinic and I think ‚Äúfuck it, one last thing for today then I‚Äôm going home‚Äù.  

I walk in. It‚Äôs a free clinic. I just checked the boxes of the shit I wanted to get checked for and waited a couple minutes until they called me back. Pissed if a cup. Pricked my finger for blood. As we were waiting for the ‚Äúinstant‚Äù blood test thing to show a result I did more paperwork. As we were doing paperwork I saw the nurse guy glance at one of the strips that had blood on it and I noticed his demeanor change a little bit. He was kind of stern when I first walked in. Very terse and short. I was probably his last person for the day as it was almost 5 and he probably just wanted to get the fuck out of there. After he glanced at the strip his voice softened. His eyes became kinder. He said nothing and continued with questioning for his paper work. I dismissed it as me being paranoid. In a couple seconds he was gonna tell me that I was all good and send me on my way....

After the paperwork was done he looked at me and said ‚Äúok...let‚Äôs talk about your results‚Äù

Me ‚Äú...k‚Äù

Him ‚Äúso this strip is for HIV....you are negative‚Äù

Me ‚Äúpraise Jesus‚Äù

Him ‚Äúthis other test is for hep C....‚Äù

Me ‚Äú....‚Äù

Him ‚Äúi have some news for you...you are positive for hep C‚Äù

I was waiting for him to smile and tell me he was fucking with me and that I‚Äôm good and free to go. He didn‚Äôt. 

Fuck. 

God fucking damnit. Are you fucking kidding me?

He says there‚Äôs a 20% chance it was a false positive and they would have to draw actual blood instead of doing finger prick to know for sure but since my veins are totally fucked they were unable to do it. I‚Äôm gonna have to pound water and go for a run then go in tomorrow to have blood drawn to know for sure. 

You guys are the first to know. I haven‚Äôt even told my mom yet. I‚Äôm extremely upset about all of this.

So there I was, fantasizing about how great it‚Äôs gonna feel to get ALL my errands done and actually be able to chill on my days off instead of running around doing shit... and now I gotta go give them blood and probably get treated for hep fucking C. Not to mention break the news to this girl. 

I just can‚Äôt believe it. I mean, I even went and got a fucking flu shot today just because that‚Äôs the type of shit normal adults do! I mean, FUCK!

Fuck me, fam. 

Ain‚Äôt that some shit? 

As always, thanks for reading. 

Also- let this be a fucking lesson for everyone out there. Even after you get clean as fuck and you have your life back together... the life still has a way of catching up to you. One way or another, the piper gets paid. ",1510805375.0

I have transverse Myelitis ( similar to MS ) and I am in pain throughout the day. I've tried everything and the only thing that seems to help is weed, fenatyl patches, and oxycodone. I was using the patches but the price for them got out of hand, 400-500$ for a months worth of patches (tf?). Oxycodone is cheaper and I am able to go throughout my day unlike weed which I only use when I am going to sleep. I was told to go to Pain Management to get my script back but I'm unsure on if I'll get the amount I was getting. I'm a female, 4'11"", and weigh around 81 pounds. I haven't had insurance in a while and I've just got it back again so I've mainly been relying on Kratom for a whole year. I've tried to use mainly Kratom but I've gotten fired from three different jobs solely because they would no let me sit and I would be in tears crying because the pain would get bad. Not to mention I have to wear a diaper my whole life because this disease messed up my bladder and I'm only 22. I went to a general practice doctor a week before and he's known not to give any pain pills but he was understanding of my pain and didn't give much but gave me ten 10mg oxycontin. I'm worried about pain management mainly because of my age, height, and weight so they wouldn't give me any or even close to my script. I also went to the ER a month before and they even gave me a script for 12 10 MG Oxycodone ( which again they never give pain pills but still was understanding of my situation ). I thought my tolerance would go down but because of the Kratom, one or two did nothing for my pain. I could take 3-4 10 MG Oxycodone and it would manage to bring my pain down to where I can function a bit normally. I honestly don't know what to do, I still live with my grandparents and they want me to get another job but it's too hard so I'm unsure on if going to Pain Management will even be beneficial. Not to mention, because I smoke weed, they would probably turn me down because I live in Georgia and weed is illegal here unless you have a medicinal marijuana card but even if you do have it, you can only carry CBD oil with 5% THC. Does anyone have any suggestions or can anyone tell me how a first appointment with PM will go? Worrying about all of this especially when I'm only 22 is just too stressful and I honestly wish I could just have my disease cured and never go to a doctor again. Sorry for the rambling, but anyways thanks for any help!

Tl;dr I'm short, young, weigh little, and I have transverse myelitis also my tolerance and pain is very high (can take 30-40 mg oxys) is going to PM worth it? If not what can I do?",1510802760.0

But then I always stop myself. Because I remember what it was like to listen to that kind of bullshit.

More specifically, I remember how I felt when I was still using, and would stumble upon some insufferable blow-hard touting his new sober life, urging me into the light with his own personal brand of aggressive positivity. Somewhere up there, I‚Äôd imagine, high upon his towering soapbox, there were an abundance of good intentions. And I guess to be drunk on sobriety is better than the alternative. But, personally, I‚Äôll pass on that lecture. Good for you, high-five, two thumbs up.

Fuck, man. I knew my life was shit. I knew there was a better way to do it. You didn‚Äôt exactly need to be an enlightened yogi to tell me that.

Regardless, whether I was reluctantly squatted in a metal chair at a 12-step meeting or browsing r/opiates (or, god forbid‚Ä¶ r/opiatesrecovery) this kind of method in egging people toward recovery did not sit right with me, and still to this day, does not. 

So, rather than go from the familiar bad life / good life dichotomy I‚Äôd rather attack this a different way, and merely bring to light a certain concept I learned through my struggles. One that I would never have had the luck of learning without suffering through my addiction to opiates. And my hope is that it can help someone regardless of whether they are trying to quit or not.

Long before my addiction, and even before I had even used any drugs at all, I was a sophomore in high school sitting in spanish class. I was lucky enough to have one of the coolest teachers around, Mr. Durazo. From students to staff, everybody loved Mr. D. 

He had a very sly talent of bestowing some solid life advice on his students. And in retrospect, his main goal may not have been to teach us Spanish but to prepare us for real life. Anyway, one day the topic of drugs came up in class. There was a recent weed bust at the school, and a several kids got expelled. It was such a hot topic at the time that no teachers were even attempting to graze the subject with a 10 ft. pole. But not Mr. D, he took it head on and had an encouraged open discussion about it. 

Sooner or later the topic delved into harder drugs, and before long, heroin came up. I am going to paraphrase here because it was a long time ago, but he said something to the extent of: 

‚ÄúYes, of course, there‚Äôs all the standard reasons to not use a drug like heroin, like overdose, needles, health reasons, etc. But, in addition to all of that, I‚Äôd imagine it would also leave somewhat of a... ‚Äòlonging,‚Äô if you will. Like a hole that could never be filled again. That is to say, I‚Äôd be worried that the experience would be so good and so pleasurable that no other future life experience could even compare. Just think about it! It‚Äôs not like your brain would just forget how heroin felt! Every single fun, happy, or pleasurable experience thereafter might only be judged in comparison to that one amazing time I did heroin, and thereby making that experience relatively less enjoyable.‚Äù

Pretty god damn insightful for a person who has presumably never used heroin before.

At the time, I remember not thinking too much into it. I had hardly started getting into pot at that point in my life so my opinions about drugs weren‚Äôt a priority. I don‚Äôt know why it even stuck with me after all these years. So, I didn‚Äôt really give it much thought, but I understood what he meant.

Basically, this kind of suff:

‚ÄúWow, that sex was great‚Ä¶ well...I mean, it wasn‚Äôt like heroin great, but it was still good.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhat an amazing hike that was, look at the view! What an experience! Ya, not a heroin experience, but still great!‚Äù

‚ÄúThis movie is pretty enjoyable, it would be better with a side of opiates though.‚Äù

‚ÄúMan! What a relaxing shower after a hard day‚Äôs work, ahhh nothing could make this any better, well‚Ä¶ aside from heroin.‚Äù

I think you get the picture. Mr. D was looking at repercussions a different way. In essence, he expected there to be an asterisk next to everything good that happened afterwards, denoting, ‚ÄúWell, not as good as heroin.‚Äù

At the time, I did think he had a good point, but I didn‚Äôt think he was entirely correct. I thought someone who tried heroin could probably compartmentalize each life experience afterwards and judge each experience on it‚Äôs own merit rather that how it fared compared to heroin.

Only problem there was that I was wrong.

It absolutely can diminish some of my more relaxing or pleasurable activities I do today. For example, maybe after a tough day laying in bed the idea creeps in ‚Äúthis would be way better opiated.‚Äù Or the glow after sex, ‚Äúthis is kind of like a heroin rush, but heroin would last way longer.‚Äù 

Before I proceed, I just want to be clear that these are very minute, fleeting, subconscious feelings of ‚Äúit could be better.‚Äù They aren't actually thoughts that I‚Äôm saying to myself in my head. That would make it more like a craving. I can‚Äôt express enough how different this is from a craving. There‚Äôs no emotion or urges tied to it.

A long time ago, I watched a CNN documentary about a guy was about to die from a heart complication. He had only a matter of hours or days left. Then one doctor came out of nowhere and was willing to do an experimental surgery on him, and it ended up saving his life. The guy said he went into that surgery expecting he was never going to wake up. And then when he did wake up and realized he was going to survive, it was the happiest and most exhilarating moment of his entire life--which means a lot coming from a 70 year old.

When I saw this I was like, ‚ÄúDamn, I get that feeling several times per week. Sitting in my car, hardcore withdrawing, desperate, panicking. Literally feeling like I‚Äôm going to die. Then I get the ‚Äúcome thru‚Äù text and I am on top of the fucking world.‚Äù

Whether it‚Äôs that or simply shooting up, that kind of euphoric exhilaration is absolutely unparalleled. I have yet to find a thing, person, place or thing that can instantaneously have me believing that all my problems were gone and I was on top of the world like these kind of instances did. That kind of instant gratification just doesn't exist outside of chemical manipulation of your neurotransmitters, in my personal experience at least. 

I sometimes do miss those times. But I am glad they‚Äôre gone, because with the highs come the lows. But, funny enough, the lows in my addiction are what help me the most now.

Which brings me to the flipside of this concept--in the same way that my addiction has been able to make certain things comparatively less enjoyable, it has, to an ever greater extent, made almost everything in my life comparatively less worrisome, troublesome, and unpleasant. This has helped improve my life drastically. I‚Äôm more comfortable in my skin, more confident, less fearful and anxious.

It‚Äôs hard for anything to really phase me like it would have before my addiction. Anything, and I mean anything, I might have to struggle though today is exponentially easier in comparison than the shit I had to endure in the worst of my addiction. 

Have to change a car tire on the freeway in the rain? Meh, I'll suck it up and get it done, no biggie. 
Have to change a car tire on the freeway in the rain‚Ä¶ in withdrawal?! Fuck. That. Noise. 

Have to walk down the street to get the mail? Minor inconvenience, possibly even enjoyable.
Have to walk down the street to get the mail, while you know there‚Äôs people out there looking to fuck you up because you haven‚Äôt paid them back yet? Ah, yeah, i‚Äôll wait ‚Äòtill it‚Äôs dark. 

Get pulled over by a cop for busted tail light? Whatever, take the fixit ticket. 
Get pulled over by a cop for a busted taillight, with a quarter ounce of freshly copped dope under your seat.? Time to start panicking.

These are just a few easier examples. This idea even extends to things that don‚Äôt have a direct situational comparison.

Boss yelling at me for something I had no part in? The world will not end. It won‚Äôt even ruin my day now.

Loosing my job? That would freak me out before, that shit wouldn‚Äôt even affect my sleep now. I lost more jobs in my addiction than I can count. And if I got through it then, I can definitely get through it now.

Can't pay rent because my shity minimum wage job is cutting hours? Eh, not ideal, but I can handle it. I‚Äôll crash at my sister‚Äôs or just sleep comfortably in my car for a bit. Nothing too bad. What‚Äôs bad is living on the streets in the winter with no money, dealing with cops, having to steal to get drugs, having to look over my shoulder.

The ups and downs I went through in my addiction have had the unintended effect of centering me, insofar as the relatively minor ups and downs of my life today seem so god damn insignificant. And if you've never felt that way before, let me tell you, that feeling is empowering as fuck! I feel more like a rock now and less like a feather. I feel more solid, my emotions are not subject to whichever way the wind blows.

So all in all, there are some negative consequences from my drug use that have persisted, but they are far outweighed by the positives I‚Äôve taken away. There was a point in my life, when I was living in a small walk-in closet of a trap house, in withdrawal, out of money, no health insurance, freezing cold, fleas everywhere, trying to sleep and failing, anxious, desperate, and demoralized. I had lost everyone who ever cared about me, no one would talk to me anymore. When I felt beyond lost, at an impasse, with only one more option available. For the first time in my life, I thought to myself, ‚ÄúBeing dead wouldn‚Äôt be so bad.‚Äù 

When it comes down to it, fear is useful for us as humans because it helps keeps us alive. But what if we no longer want to be alive, what then? Well, then fear loses its main purpose, and it feels a bit lighter. I felt comfort in that. Looking back, it was in this moment that I learned fear was more a condition of perception rather than something intrinsic. It was optional. And nothing but going to the deepest, darkest place would have been able to show me that. 

No longer in my addiction, there is no outside circumstance in the universe that could make me feel the way I felt that night. All of life's problems seem so insignificant in comparison to the time that was so bad that death was a better alternative to living. There is no person, no situation, no circumstance today that could rival the utter hopelessness of what I felt that night. And the fact that I survived that makes me feel like I can survive anything.

You are the only one that can decide if your life will be better without opiates. I‚Äôm not here to tell you my life was bad, now it is good, and you're stupid if you don't live the way I do. I just wanted to share with you something I learned along the way, something that has had a positive impact on my life. And the cool part is that it‚Äôs just a perspective--not a program, or a step, or a self-help booklet. Just a different way of looking at the struggles you may be going through. It doesn't have to be that you are broken because of what you've been through, it can be that you  are stronger because of it.

Strong swords are forged in fire. Keep that in mind.

I'd vowed to never do one without the other, but I fail that every time I try to quit opiates but that combination is a total match made in heaven. 

What confuses me though is the sheer contrast of it all. For example, I distinctly remember trying, buying and then smoking a new brand of cigarettes (idk if you guys have Winston Blues there)  that seemed really good while I was all fucked up on Oxy, but the next day all out of drugs I had a puff on one of my final Winstons and it was fucking gross. I ended up giving the rest of them away for a single Marlboro, I couldn't bear the taste of them. 

This has been something that's happened to me many times. Don't get me wrong either, I am not at all a picky smoker - I'm not one of these ""I only exclusively smoke Lucky Strike and will go through nicotine withdrawals before taking a puff of anything else"" assholes. On heroin, good cigarettes & tobacco tastes like the pussy of the holy spirit, and even awful tobacco & cigs will taste fine. 

So it's not just the fact that they feel better or that the nicotine buzz is enhanced and has a lovely synergy with opiates - although by god that is all correct - but its honestly as if the actual physical taste of the things change. It's weird because IME for everything else my sense of taste is slightly dulled on opiates, but the taste of cigarettes changes radically for the better.

Pain Management has always interested me. Do you just walk in for an appointment about pain and get prescribed opiates, do you have to have proof of something like a car accident, are you referred by a doctor only after complaining for a year? 
I‚Äôm sick of being a junkie copping a gram of H at a time but one big reason I always go back after getting clean is having a bad day where my back is killing me.

It has been gruelling, exhilarating, rewarding, punishing and not as big a deal as people would have you believe. I just need to get some shit off my chest and whose collective shoulder to cry on could be better than my fellow rejects' ? I'm hoping to demystify the billion-dollar industry that is recovery with this post, and who knows some of you might get inspired to turn your lives around or at least try (because Lord do I know that my shit is far from fixed).


First thing I noticed is that the key to sober life is basically dividing your day into little segments, carefully balancing responsibilities and leisure time. It doesn't have to be rocket surgery, you're in recovery so treat yourself to whatever hobbies you'd like to indulge in. Don't overburden yourself with a million goals, like losing weight, getting swole, fixing your legal and financial shit all at the same time. It's paramount to happiness that you set attainable goals (fucking Anthony Robbins over here, I know). I just read a bunch, listen to lots of music and watch lots of TV. I socialize at work, do some online dating and that's that. It's hilariously uncomplicated in comparison to shooting dope and coke daily, but this leads us to the next lesson.


Life is gonna get boring. How could it not be? There simply are no better feelings than shooting hard drugs. So you really need to come to terms with the fact that you'll never get the same peaks of unadulterated euphoria again. This pissed me off to no end at first, but after a while, I settled in. The highs may not be as intense, but they're more sustainable. I love reading, and no it will never get me as happy as a shot of good coke, but it won't break me as a person as much either, not by a long shot. So you need to visualize how a mediocre, content life (by junkie standards of course) can be made appealing to you.


And finally. FUCK COCAINE. If you have a coke habit as well as a heroin habit, I got good and bad news for you. First, you won't crave dope as much as you're afraid you might. However, the coke cravings are *real*. Every now and then, I'm overwhelmed by the immense need for a bellringer. Some trivial things which triggered this feeling:

- the vague smell of fuel
- bouts of nausea
- glass tubes
- any white powder period
- ringing/pressure in my ears

All this shit takes me back to last year: sitting on my bed, geeking so hard I'm unable to move, breathing hard, my heart about to give out, vomiting and loading a new shot of girl every ten minutes. Oh I'm still suffering the consequences: my veins are fucked. I never had a problem finding places to hit until I started fucking with coke.


So yeah, fuck cocaine. It's the real devil to beat, at least for me.",1510782692.0

I'm currently almost 6 months sober living in a recovery house. I was using heroin everyday for a few months (sniffed) and got up to about 1-1.5 g's daily because I didn't do anything but use. I didn't work (stole to fund habit) didn't go out just simply sat and used. I have a job right now, 50 hrs week as a cook and about to get a raise so I'd be getting close to 500/week. I'm really bored all the time, I have found some comfort in AA but i feel like it's not enough. Now maybe that's just my brain saying it would like endorphins and that I shouldn't be living a regular life, but i just don't see myself staying clean long term. Not because I can't do it, but because I just don't enjoy it especially once I move out of my recovery house and have a lot more responsibilities and bills.

 I have been talking to my old plug because I really want to use, but I've been torn due to my newfound stability and my family talking to me and stuff is nice. That's really it though. My plan would be to use every once in a while(I don't get drug tested so I'd just have to get high at night when no one would notice in my room) so like once a week or so. I have two back up plans in case I do get caught which would be to go to a detox for 2 days and come back to recovery house (house rules, not an Oxford house) or to move in with my plug who said I can if I have to.

It started as a recreational fling with 30's, then these awesome fentanyl laced 30's came into town, only had to snort a quarter to be lit. Kept doing those until my buddy said ""hey you should try this one time."" I said fuck it, so we loaded up a rig with about a 3rd of a dirty 30, let him hit me with it, then BAM! Holy shit I felt like I was in heaven. Then 30 seconds later ran to the toilet to puke. Fast forward a couple weeks of only doing that a couple more times but still snorting daily, those start to disappear, and dope comes into the picture. Started banging that daily. Fast forward to a few weeks ago, no money, working every day, skinniest I've ever been in my life, selling whatever I can to get money. I finally break down, call my grandparents, tell them I've been on drugs, (my mother is in a nursing home and they can see her bank account which I had been using to get dope funded by the state, fuck). A week or so goes by, and I break down again. A change has to be made. I call my dad, who was been a marine officer his whole life, and tell him what's up. Tell him I need help and ask him to come get me. Sunday comes and he's here, helping me pack and throw away all my stuff. We head back to his house Monday morning. The past few days haven't been completely horrible. No sleep Monday night with restless legs and pools of sweat. But last night, I actually got some sleep. Last night I didn't wake up drenched in sweat. I got up at 7:30 as I could fall back asleep. Came downstairs and talked with my step mom. Told her how I slept, and that I am feeling better physically and already a little mentally. Yesterday I was depressed and didn't see a possibility of my life being successful. Today, as I was sitting outside smoking a cig, breathing the chilly air, the sun in full brightness, I felt good. I felt positive. I felt like I'm overcoming this disease and that there is hope for my life to be something again. I still have a lot of work to do, and a whole lot of debt to pay off, but I have a new outlook and positivity that I haven't felt in a very long time. Today, I feel good. Today, I feel positive.

So I tend to get dope in larger quantities (7-14g max or something like 50 Oxies) and WD in between with hopes of never getting back and crying in loneliness - aka ""the usual"". It's important to get it in large quantities much less frequently.

Now, when the shit comes, what I do, is I create few emergency portions and hide them well. From the perspective of me getting new shit, I don't care. I have more than enough for now, and I won't be running out anytime soon so it doesn't phase me at all. By the time I run out I don't even remember where and if I put aside anything at all.

Many of the negative effects, especially those we experience as dependent individuals occurs due to tolerance, dose escalation and downregulation of the endogenous opioid system (fewer, less sensitive MOPs) and an increase in the level of signalling from other excitatory neurochemical pathways. 
Acute withdrawal is often the result of an upregulated overactive noradrenergic system combined with increased glutamatergic neurotransmission. These develop rapidly and are lost rapidly (although when withdrawing a week of the brain downregulating these upregulated systems in response to acute opioid withdrawal seems anything but rapid). 

It has been shown that many of the downstream compensatory pathways that are activated in response to chronic opioid use are triggered by opioid receptor internalisation.  Morphine, Heroin, Fentanyl all bind to the MOP causing its phosphorylation and eventual internalisation (as well as releasing a G-Protein from the complex leading to the positive subjective opioid effects. 

TRV130 is an opioid optimised for maximum G-Protein signalling (pain relief, sedation, euphoria) and minimal beta-arrestin2 signalling (internalisation, tolerance and physical dependence). 

It doesn‚Äôt feel like morphine to take, nor does it sedate as much as Fentanyl. I have used it to replace my entire Fentanyl and morphine usage for the last 2 days and have not suffered any WD or ill effects. Nor have I had to escalate the dose. 
I plan to continue the experiment for the rest of the week. 

Please take some time to read the [link](http://www.trevena.com/pdf/ChenetalJMedChem2013_TRV130leadop.pdf) to see how this opioid with unique and possibly very positive features for those dependent, in pain requiring excessive opioid doses due to tolerance and for those new opioid users in acute leading to chronic pain that may avoid rapid dose escalation and tachyphylaxis with this interesting almost licenced chemically unique opioid drug. 
There is also a Wikipedia article for TRV130 which contains less information but may be more accessible to everyone. 

(When licensed, if not before, this drug is bound for schedule 2, so any others interested in synthesis out there, the enclosed paper will also sure give you some ideas on how to modify TRV130, once scheduled, to produce legal analogs (until those get scheduled also), as it did for myself)

I lost the crooks of my arms, and I have a really hard time hitting other veins for no particular reason (I have really good veins too). I live in NJ so my dope is ECP (powder) and the veins in my forearm have a lot of scar tissue so they're pretty hardened and sore.

I couldn't hit any other vein so I went to my left forearm which I've left alone for a few days (really didn't want to use it but I'm desperate). I drew a tiny bit of blood, tried to dig around for some more blood and got some more to the point where I felt comfortable. I injected just a little bit - it didn't burn at all (it usually would, and I've missed a tiny drop with this same dope and it'll burn if I missed), so I kept going little by little until it was all gone. In the back of my mind I don't feel like I registered well enough, but it didn't burn at all, everything was fine after, and all was well. I didn't really feel the rush I usually feel, but I had also done a lot an hour prior to this one, and was just doing these 2 bags to get  as much of a nod as I could.

If I press to where the vein is, right before the scar tissue that I'm trying to avoid is, there is the tiniest of tiny bumps (where I IV'd). You have to press to feel it and it's barely noticeable. Doesn't hurt, isn't warm, isnt swollen, isn't red at all: nothing. But for some reason I still have some gut feeling that I missed.

So, the reason for this post is - can I still have missed even though I didn't experience any of the burning/symptoms of a miss? Does it always go the same way? Or did I just get lucky and I was registered enough to get it all in there without a problem?


TLDR ---- feel like I missed a shot but there wasn't any pain/burning, no symptoms, no redness, no swelling, no lumps/bumps, no nothing - I did register SOMEWHAT but I just kind of pulled the trigger on a whim because I was frustrated. Can you still miss without experiencing any symptoms? Would be the first shot I ever fully missed.",1510726917.0

It's crazy to think of how far I've come. Moved over 1000 miles away from my home state to a warmer land, winter has never been better. I weighed 130 pounds in May at my worst as a daily IV heroin/meth addict (6 foot 2 inch tall male) and I have gained 60 pounds !  I also have maintained the same job for 6 months and recently purchased a car registered and insured in my name. I'm registered for college in January and of course getting high still has it's appeal. But after going to an NA meeting tonight it just doesn't feel like an option.

Know that you can quit, it takes some courage and pain getting through the withdrawals, but in the end if you are REALLY sick and tired of being sick and tired, there are so many good rehabs in US, Canada, Europe, etc if that is an option. It worked wonders for me.

Not sure if I can do this but if anyone is in the American South West, there's a drug/alcohol treatment program I live at that is phenomenal. It's a ranch outside of town with animals and around 30-35 dudes at any given time that CARE a lot about their sobriety. The awesome thing is that it's a mere $700 a month which includes food and rent and treatment. Thats a steal compared to other programs charging thousands.

Or at least I thought.. If you dont Im about to really help you out!! Enjoy,"So I just recently saw a post somewhere with a picture of a pill and someone asking if it were fake or not, and I'm not gonna lie this kind of blew my mind.  First that people are still trying to detect if pills are fake or not by looking at it (which I guess can help sometimes but others its impossible and the fakes look better than the real ones) and the fact that by not knowing how to test for this and the current situation of the market these days that its ridiculous and I can only imagine how many times you've been ripped off and will continue to get ripped off, so I thought I'd share this method I learned, and hopefully it will help you guys out in detecting fakes just as much as its helped me.  Enjoy!

When purchasing prescription medication off the street's these days you at constant risk of purchasing fake or imitation shit, claiming to be one medication but in return getting a pill filled with a bunch of fillers and food coloring leaving you on the verge of withdraw and begging for anything just to get well.  So that's why I am going to let you in on a little secret I know, that someone taught me wayyyy back in the day and has been saving my ass ever since.  Because it might not be your dealers intentions to sell you fake shit but you never know when your going to come up on the shit and whether they knew or not you don't want to be the one getting stuck with the shit at the end of the day.  So use these quick couple of steps to test your medications before buying them and hopefully you wont be fucked and posting pictures like the kid mentioned above hoping that you have real shit when you and I both know if hes posting on here asking.. Its most likely fake shit.. 

So lets begin..

How to test if the medication is bunk or not.. 

When purchasing the medication what you want to do is take the pill itself and tap it lightly on your tongue.  I'm not talking slobber all over it, just one simple light tap on the tongue should do and you should be able to tell in a matter of seconds.  Also if done correctly the person your buying them from will have no idea what you even just did nor care because it wont affect the medication what so ever and if you end up not wanting it just hand the shit back and say no its fake and there's nothing they can really do in the first place.  

So don't ask if you can tap it on your tongue just ask to see it and take a few out at random and tap them on your tongue.  If the medication is real when tapping it on your tongue you'll immediately be able to tell.  The pill will have a sour, lemony, prescriptiony pill taste, that can be immediately' noticed and hard to explain but if you a prescription pill of some kind next to you (which I'm sure most of you have ;) ) grab that thing and tap it on your tongue and you will soon see what I am talking about.  Its almost exactly like what a fresh bottle of oxy smells like the second you get them from the pharmacy and open it up for the first time and inhale that beautiful chemical smell into your lungs.  Its that but in taste..


Now if the medication is fake or bunk and the guy is trying to rip you off.  The will will almost have the complete opposite affect once tasting it.  Instead of being pungent and sour and lemony, electric.  It will instead be so bland, chalky, tasteless, and seriously feel like its almost repelling the moisture off of your mouth and will taste like absolutely nothing, except chalk.  



You'd be surprised about how many real looking fakes are out there.  So much so that one time I got sold 1,000 fake pills back in the day and they looked so real that I used to take 2 out of 5 pills and replace them with the fakes and bet people that if they could pick the two fakes out of the group that I would give them the 3 real ones that were in there and let them look at it and examine them in any way possible, yet unfortunately no one knew this technique and no one was ever able to detect the 2 fake ones out of the group, but if they'd of known this method it would of been as easy as 123 and I would of been out of three of my shit.l haha

However, this method hasn't stopped me from buying fake pills since I learned it because honestly most of the time we are getting ripped of the con artist whose doing the deal knows whats going on and will distract you enough to the point where your going to hand the money over before ever being able to get the chance to look at shit.  So you've got to be smart when doing these things, and just remember when its to good to be true, or when you have the feeling you about to get ripped off.. Most of the time you are and you should just get the fuck out no matter how hard that is at times, but just try your best to get out of the situation and definitely don't hand over any money.

Because think, you and I both know that if someone if going to have a problem with you looking at the shit before purchasing it, most of the time its not a good situation.  You don't need to see them all.. Just one will do the trick.  So give it your best shot and just remember this the next time you buying your medication!



Be safe and ENJOY!",1510720956.0

I've had a habit for about four years, but this past year it has gotten out of control. I have spent $450-$600 on opiates every week, all year long. 7 months  ago my four year relationship ended. He kicked me out, abandoned me, and went to rehab. My parent's are extremely religious, and have made my life a living hell since they found out I didn't hold the same views as them. I have been emotionally abused by them to an extreme extent. If I smoked weed at their house they would kick me out. I have no support from anyone. So, with  no one to turn to, I started shooting five months ago. I have been hustling and doing all kinds of crazy things to support my habit. I do have a job, but I am beyond behind on all of my bills. I'm about to lose everything. Since I live with my parents, they are starting to catch on to my habits. I think they are going to connect the dots sooner rather than later. I've been taking fent pressed pills, so my tolerance is ridiculous. I have tried to go through withdrawal, but I always cave in the first 24-48 hours. I don't know what to do. I am horrified of the repercussions of telling my parents. I am afraid to quit. I don't know where to go for help. Methadone/subs? NA? Any advice would be welcome. Thanks ",1510716426.0

Someday Kratom may not be available for you to try, so if you ever wanted to try it for opiate addiction, the sooner the better.

And for those of you that tried it and did not feel anything you have to do it kind of like subs, you have to wait till you are in withdrawals to start, it is very light compared to the other stuff we take: ie-subs, methadone, heroin

Saved my life and want your life saved too. Whatever it takes..

Like the AA BigBook says:
""There is a principle which is a bar against all information, which is proof against all arguments and which can not fail to keep a man in everlasting ignorance-that principle is contempt prior to investigation."" --HERBERT SPENCER

After a few minutes I felt a subtle buzz, no euphoria but my body was really relaxed.

I am an addict. I accept that fact. I am in extreme pain from a broken metatarsal fracture on the pinkie side. 

I asked for pain medication, as I am on suboxone trying to fix my life. The buprenorphine does not provide pain relief.   

I care about my life and I talked to my pain management/suboxone prescriber and he said it was alright to stop the suboxone to get pain medication to be effective for my broken foot. 

They refused any pain medication of narcotic nature. I was not looking for a high. I'm in extreme pain and needed help, and was refused. 

I am not angry. Just upset that I'm labeled as a drug seeking addict and refused help for my pain. 

Thank you for inquiring

7cytvq,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7cytvq/deal_with_the_devil/,21,https://redd.it/7cytvq,sloan_fitch,Deal with the devil..,"Last Sunday I was summoned while in light WD to fix a wifi problem for my friend's sister. They wanted to use a streaming web app and they had some trouble. So I installed a range extender (which I will be taking back after I run a long Ethernet cable to their bed room with a shittier AP) and configured official premium channel apps to work on her fire stick.

The cable TV web app that lets you get the channel line-up without a cable box was not working so well because the laptop was shitty. It was given to her out of my trash heap as a birthday present from her mom and siblings that I configured for her.

So I decided it would be easier to give her a more powerful laptop from the trash heap. Nonetheless, I spent time and I did some good work so she got me a sub. Later that week she's bugging me on a friday evening after a long day and I'm just like ""I need to wind down, I had a long day and I just found out that I need to wake up at 6AM tomorrow.""

That evening she bought it up a couple of times how she helped me out last week but she didn't bring up much detail. Two nights later after a twelve hour work day I bought her an HDMI cable. Although it was free, I indicated that it cost me money. She asked me to bring it for use with a blu-ray player. So when I handed it to her she asked me if I could come up to help her with it.

&nbsp;

Upon explaining to her how simple it would be to plug the HDMI cable into her blu-ray player she explains she wanted help with the cable TV web app which I had already told her I'd address the following day. 

I explain to her that I'm currently setting up a new laptop to give to her and she brings up the fact that she already helped me and I'm like ""I got you, and you already have the HBO apps on your fire stick, use that for now..""

She then bugs me more. Brings up how she helped me the week prior with Suboxone and I'm just trying to shut her up because I didn't tell her brother that I got a sub that day. 


&nbsp;

Why would I withhold this info from my friend? When I need him to get subs, he'll give me dope or pills and assure me that he'll get subs then often fail to get them. Last time I needed him to get subs he lied about being in contact with someone who had subs and never got subs when I needed. In times of the past, I've had WD from fent laced dope and had to suffer through work so it's important that I get subs when I ask for them and am willing to pay for them.

I've shared subs with my friend before but this time around I wanted to have something that he wasn't aware of so that I'd have it on deck when I would otherwise be in a bind. As a result, I now have a half a sub left when I otherwise would've been dope sick at work on a cold day.

&nbsp;

So now, when I deliver her laptop I still gotta be nice because she may be my only easy sub connect. I'll pay cash so she can't hold it over me. I'll also carefully explain to her how she's an asshole for saying that she helped me get a sub when I needed it in front of her brother when she knows damn well that I didn't share it with him while he was under the weather.

&nbsp;

For the work I've done I should get multiple free subs from her for fuck sake. She likely bought it up in front of her brother get me to hustle since she was putting me in a bad and awkward spot. I was forced to explain it away in some busllshit way which I managed to do effectively.

&nbsp;

Once I give her this workign replacment laptop tonight she better shut the fuck up. I'm also installing the same OS to a spare hard drive in case the hard drive currently in that laptop stops working. Why would it stop working? The other day when she pissed me off I dropped the laptop and side-kicked it in my frustration right after she left the room. So I expect the HDD to be unreliable and possibly to stop working. The plan is to be prepared to swap in a working replacement immediately after she calls me when it stops working. This'll allow me to expend the most minimal effort when that time comes.",1510693861.0

I think that this question is born of the type of thinking that keeps people away from treatment...i will explain:

If addiction is a medical issue (I don't believe it is a disease, but I do believe that the only real way to deal with opiate addiction is medically), then why is it so scandalous to bring ones children to the clinic?  We would never say it was inappropriate to bring a child to the urgent care with us if we have a sore throat.  The fact that we feel this way doesn't bode well for the future of treatment in this country.

Take it a step further:  how many people avoid the methadone clinic (which, along with suboxone/subutex, is the gold standard in opiate dependence treatment these days, much more effective than fancy rehab or 12 step programs) because it makes them look like ""a junkie""?  I suspect that is why so many people avoid treatment for so long...as long as your addiction is a secret, you never have to face it yourself.  This attitude will kill several people in the US today, and will kill hundreds this year.  

We need to drop all the stigmas.  Sure, there are people who are former or current criminals at the clinic, but would they be criminals if the drug war was ended?  If their drug was available to them in a clean, supervised place, and at a non-prohibition inflated price?  The vast majority would breathe a sigh of relief that they could now get this drug without fear of violence and poisoning at the hands of black marketeers, and then, most importantly, find legitimate work.  This is not theory.  It's what has happened in Portugal.  It's happened in Switzerland and the UK.  It's about to happen in Canada.  

It can happen here.  We just need to be vocal, and not waste any time or energy fighting each other, claiming that I ""may be in the methadone program, but I'm one of the GOOD ONES"".  Fuck that.  We deserve to have health and happiness like any other American.  ",1510683344.0

Since I've been here only one person has paid anything towards rent and it was only $30. He makes $700 on social security though he's not disabled, he's just a heavy amphet user and he's only 29 years old. Last month the disabled home owner called him on his shit and told him that he knew he was doing meth and that rent came before his drugs or he would be out on the 1st. The first came & went and he paid $30 in rent and the rest of his money went to pay a methamphetamine debt that he accrued during the month. These two individuals don't work, they constantly rob, lie, & steal. They scream and fight 24/7 and it's over the smallest most petty shit. I caught them in the shower getting busy and they were screaming & fighting while fucking each other, I don't understand it. I can't bring my son here out of fear that these people are going to bring down legal hell on this house. Another family member lives here and her young daughter sleeps in the same room that these people crash in and they're up all day & night screaming at each other in front of her and they're exposing her to things she should never be exposed to. We have all told them to get out by xXxX date and when that day comes they always have some shirty excuse about how they're waiting on their ride to get here or ""we're getting our apartment next week and we'll be out."" But next week never comes. I have helped pack their items and taken them to the porch, but they always play this mentally disabled individual and make him feel so bad that he stays up crying at night. I've confronted them about their use and actions but they refuse to listen. They both actively and regularly lie about their use (DAILY) and tell us that they're not using while they can't sit still, they're talking so goddamn fast that they choke themselves up, and it's beyond obvious that they're using. I put my foot down and told them this shit doesn't happen here anymore, if they're going to use they can do it elsewhere as they're endangering everyone in this house and opening them up to legal repercussions. The police are very aware of who they are as one is being investigated for robbing a restaurant on Halloween. I work 2 jobs and I have a son that I can't bring here because of their use & behavior. Every night we are all awoken by them screaming at each other in front of our rooms (or walking in our rooms) and turning the lights on and off like a goddamn light show. It's like experiencing night time & day time 100 times an hour. These people weasel their ways back in by playing the disabled home owner and he's so sick of them, along with everyone else, that it's affecting his physical health and has put him in the hospital for chest pains & anxiety. Calling the police to evict them is less than ideal as we have no idea what they've hidden or what they've done, they would no doubt try to pin their drugs/contraband on someone else. 

How do we go about getting them out when they're horribly manipulative and refuse to go willingly or with help.

TL;DR I need an Amphetamine users perspective on how to deal with 2 users who refuse to work, lie, steal, and bum off of everyone they meet. They scream & fight every minute that they're awake and it's affecting the household & the children. They're extremely toxic & refuse to leave or even try to help out. Calling the police is less than ideal in this situation.",1510680287.0

For me it was those old Oxycontin pills that you could just straight up smash up and snort. I think it was a 15 if that's a thing? Only ever done oxy a couple times but I'm nearly certain it was 15mg pills. 

Sat in my front room, crushed up two and split them into lines with a mate of mine (who funnily enough was trying DMT for the first time). I remember being particularly careful as I was worried about overdosing and had been told it was common to spew the first time on opis. 

I still remember that first ever buzz coming on, it was nice and mellow and I just felt fucking fantastic, not a care in the world, watching this dude have his mind blown to pieces by the DMT. 

After that I walk him into town to get his bus and he looks like he's been skullfucked by a freight train. 

All in all a decent time and thankfully wasn't sick! 

Funny to think that it was simultaneously the first time he had a full blown spiritual experience that he still speaks of and the first step on my road to addiction. Now I'm sat smoking a gram of H a day... Good times! 

Not the most exciting story but thought I'd start us off, let's hear your first experiences! 

I'm also curious how you see the memory. Is it a fond memory or a sad one?",1510675690.0
