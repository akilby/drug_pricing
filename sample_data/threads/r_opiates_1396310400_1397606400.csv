So until I can afford to pay the ridiculous shipping fees for rigs online (plus wait for them to get here) it's all I've got. 

The problem is I can't register anymore. Other than that the syringe isn't too bad, not dirty or bent or anything, but it's too hard to pull back on the plunger once I'm in without shaking the needle around in my vein like a kid playing with a toy sword having a seizure. The result of this is I can only shoot in a single, trusty spot that I know exactly how deep it is, and now even that option is starting to go.

So are there any (sterile) options to make the plunger start gliding a bit better? I doubt there's any lubrication that's honestly safe for this situation but maybe I'm wrong. If not do you have any techniques for registering easier? Any input is appreciated. 

**tl;dr:** fuckin needle sucks. resistance on the plunger makes it difficult to register. tips maybe?",1396366583.0

The closest experience I've had to an opioid high was when I had shingles about 2 years ago and my doctor gave me ibuprofen (don't think this counts) and Tramadol pills I had 2 of each and though ""man this is pretty cool"" and just had a relaxed feeling sort of like a weed buzz but different. I'm not entirely sure what it's supposed to feel like but I doubt I'd had enough to get a decent high, I think the ibuprofen was 200mg and I'm not sure about the Tramadol. Exact same dose 3x a day (I don't think he said to take them all at once though) for about a fortnight and I never really got the same buzz as initially.

My question is how do I easily obtain some? I looked through a few pharmacies and it seems like everything is prescription only. Do I go to my doctor and say I have acute back pain or would I have to try get it off somebody who's already on pain meds, but I'd rather not deal with them thinking I'm a druggie or something.

Been through dope phases, at least once a year, a bout month binges at a time but for the most part i keep it in line, when i realize im getting  out of hand. Anyway on to the story...
 I'm coming home from school, stop by work to grab my check. Im prescribed klonopin so ive taken 2-3mg throughout the day total. Stop into work, my manager asks if I'll stick around have a beer on him. Sure, one beer down, asks if I want another. Well why wouldn't I? At this point he's telling me about his mom giving him some hydros for a real bad toothache. I'm thinking they're probably the 5's or 7.5 at best, but my interest is peaked. Side note- I've been lurking more and more lately but because of debts I haven't ridden the horse in a while but the craving has been real bad. 
Another beer down and we step out back to smoke and he asks if I want some. I ask to see the bottle
""Sure, how much ya wanting a piece?""
""Nah dude, you can have some""
""Well, it takes quite a few to get me to feeling anything I'd need like 8 or so, bro""
He's good and drunk, so he ends up giving me 9 10mg hydro.
Needless to say, down the hatch they go and I'm feeling them come on now as I finish the last of my beer. I'm gonna surprise him with some fungi in the net few days. 
Man, I cant remember the last time I've had hydrocodone, let alone gotten high off it. Hopefully with the clonazepam ive taken throughout the day I'll be feeling real good and itchy in the next hour.

Hope you enjoyed my tale.

I tried shooting molly for the first time last night. My friend came over and mentioned that he had some. I really don't enjoy rolling all that much. It definitely depends on the setting. I hate doing it at shows and festivals and stuff like that because I like to be nice and cozy. I prefer doing it in a small setting with a few friends in a house where I can chill and lie down if I need to.

So anyway I was like ""nahh I really don't like rolling so I'll pass"" but then he mentioned shooting it and my ears perked up immediately. I had never tried it and I like to try anything more than once so we made a nice shot for each of us. He mixed it up but visually I'd say it was maybe a point or a little more. And HOLY SHIT! As soon as I pushed off and got that sweet rush I felt like I was peaked on the best molly experience of my life. 

I spun poi for a bit and we cuddled and got lost in the milkdrop visualizer for a bit and when we started to come down I mixed up a nice shot with a little more than a point of ketamine and 5 stamps of ECP. Mixed him a shot with one stamp and a little less than a point of K since he has no tolerance and we blasted off on that. Just k-holed out and melted right there on my floor for about 10-15 min before we came back and it was just perfect. 

Then we had some sexy times which was amazing as me and this guy have some great energy between us and for some reason ketamine makes me really horny on top of how horny I already get from dope. After that we smoked some weed and I ate .5mg xanax and we chilled out until we nodded off into sleep.

Definitely one of the best drug combo nights I've ever had. If you like molly and you shoot, I totally recommend trying it. It's unforgettable and fucking amazing.

Well, this one was kind of a big deal. I'll try to elaborate as much as possible. Forgive me if I end up not making some sense in parts or repeating myself, I'm nodding out a decent amount. 

Recently, my love life with my fiance has gotten to the point where we only make love like, once or twice a month, and personally I can't stand this. We used to make love a lot more. It's just been over the past 6 months that it's really started to boil down to this. Now, I have needs that I really need met, I'd personally like to get back to making love at least once or twice a week or at the very least one or twice every 2 weeks. It's not like i'm wanting to have sex every single day (dope plays a big factor in that sometimes lol). Most of the issue is that my girlfriend is afraid to orgasm. (this is what I was wanting to get some advice from from any of you women here).

My fiance is seriously scared to have a vaginal orgasm because she believes that she is going to pee. Our love life has been put under a lot of stress because of this, because we will be making love and then she will make me stop because she thinks she's going to pee. Even if she's gone to the bathroom beforehand. 

I've researched a lot into it and found out that apparently that's a fairly common physical experience women perceive when they have an orgasm is that it feels like a peeing sensation as it builds up. I've tried to explain to her that it's natural and she needs to just go with it, because it will be such an amazing release for her, but she is just too scared, every time we try she just says that she can't do it, and she's too afraid, because it's such an uncomfortable feeling for her. 

This like 3/4 of the times we make love together, we end up stopping because she's about to orgasm and then she freaks out and stops me. Sometimes she starts crying, because she's so worked up over it. She thinks she's ruined the whole thing and that I hate her or that I'm mad at her. I've been nothing but absolutely respectful to her, I love my woman very much and would do anything to make her happy. So I never blame her for anything. I know she can't help the way she feels.

Do any of you have any advice that you could give me on things I could tell her on how to open up to this experience, and understand it better? 
Or any personal stories if you're willing to share (i know it may be a personal subject but we're all grown here, it's a mature discussion).",1396426809.0

I'd gone through maybe like 3 bags or so throughout the day. I finally did a big line later at around the time I decided to lay down for bed, (not go to bed, just lay down and put on some tv or play a video game or something).

I noticed I was nodding really hard, to the point where I would drool on myself, It was getting to the point where I was kind of worried but not really able to do much about it. I just figured i'd keep enjoying my high, well, all of a sudden, I wake up, to a blackness. I'm unable to move my arms or my legs, my eyes wont open. I'm consciously aware of what's going on around me, I can hear sounds and everything like that but It's almost impossible for me to move at all. I'm sitting here trying to raise my arms up and open my eyes, or try and sit up and it feels like I have 1000 lbs of weight binding me down to the bed. (I sit here, fighting this feeling and eventually after about 2 minutes or so I'm able to sit up and start to come out of it.) Obviously, I was really scared, I didn't know what was going on. I think that i'd experienced this before, but I don't think I was awake, or consciously aware at the time that it happened before because the feeling was really vivid, I knew I had experienced it before.

Anyways, I looked into it and everything i'd found said that it was sleep paralysis, and that dope definitely enhances the odds of experiencing that. Anyone have any input or familiar stories that may give me some insight on to what exactly it was that I felt?

Happy nodding! (I barely could finish this right now haha)",1396425017.0

While I'm not privy to the whole situation, what I do know is that he has *got some Jewy as fuck guys taking care of his business,* and that he is still able to provide stellar service.

I was a bit hesitant to resume my exchanges with him, given I don't know if the DA or police cloned his phone, has him under surveillance, or any number of things that would make meeting up with him a terrible idea. But as he came through for me in my time of need, i couldn't help but feel as though this was his time of need. As I'm sure the members of The Tribe settling his legal woes are not free, and the steady stream of money from myself and friends is pertinent to keeping said legal team employed. Well, tonight added a bit of a wrinkle to the situation.

Myself and /u/ChiCityNoob went on a run this evening to Two Joints, and things felt odd from the moment we got to our regular ""spot"". When we pulled into the parking spot, we noticed that the car in front of us was occupied by two people (to get a better idea, this is a side street that is two way, with parallel parking on only one side of the street, with houses on the parking side, and a rather infamous Chicago interstate down an embankment on the other). Which isn't very odd: this is a residential street that regularly has people parking, dropping off girlfriends or kids, the regular bullshit; however, it isn't a heavily trafficed street,so an ideal ""hidden in plain sight"" place to pick-up.

After the couple sat there for a bit, I decided to double check with Two Joints: he will regularly service a few folks at a time, so rolling up to another couple of fidgeting sweat-bags isn't out of the ordinary. After checking in with Two Joints, we found out we were the only ones he was coming to see. After telling him it was a '12 or so Chrysler whateverthefuck hatchback, not your expected UC or Jump Out Boys ride, a simple *we cool* assuaged our fears.

Two Joints rolls through as he promptly does, exchange, and then we pull out after him, heading towards the aforementioned Interstate. We get 1/4 of the way down the block and our Chrysler pulls out. Immediately a brick of *fuck* sinks into my stomach and before I can alert /u/ChiCityNoob, the driver, he lets me know he knows.

Now this is where it gets tricky and hard to visualize, as the ramp we need for the Interstate is on the other side. Between us and the open lanes of elude-ability are 3 lights, 2 stop signs, 2 lefts, and as it developed, a right into a very illegal U turn. Essentially, we were one big U shape away from the ramp.

Now, I know /u/ChiCityNoob relatively well, but during our six months of friendship, he never mentioned that while he worked for diamond/rare gem importer, he took a week-long, FBI trained class on how to elude possible hi-jackings/diamond-bag-grabbing type situations. Basically how to get the fuck out of dodge and lose a tail. 

Holy shit is the only way to express the near ineffable thoughts and words that stammered out of my mouth as we jumped left-hand turns on green lights, weaved through residential two-laners, and in the matter of 30 seconds put a handful of cars, turns, and lights between us and the now definitely following Chrysler. Once we rolled through the last stop sign, just 300 yards and one stoplight was between us and Interstate freedom from the now speeding Chrysler. 

But it wasn't like the previous stoplights, this one was not only a large/busy intersection, but the timing was completely skewed for those heading in the perpendicular direction. And as we came to about 100 yards out, the light had just turned red, meaning the following Chrysler could have popped into neutral and still have caught up to us. The only option became the Pièce de résistance of this sad excuse of a tale, bust a right on red and immediately pull a U-turn, putting us just 50 yards and a soft right onto the Interstate. 

As I gave him the instruction, I was sure we were fucked, no way we'd be able to squeeze into the traffic, and then cut across the other side of the busy boulevard. We lucked out on the first part, the right was easy, but the U-turn, good God, that old '88 Olds, she made the swing, groaning at the joints, coughing out the pedal-to-the-floor exhaust, and making tires into piglets squealing the whole fucking way.

Three miles and about 23 lane changes later, I finally relaxed my asshole, as with the moderate traffic, as far as the Chrysler was concerned, we might as well've been in Ottawa.

We weren't sure who, or what the Chrysler was, but were positive it was after us for some reason. Could have been the state trying to build a better case against Two Joints (but a quick call revealed Two Joints had no issues on his side), Undercover Jump Out Boys, or even a rival D-Boy trying to steal a customer. Regardless, after a half dozen Pall Malls and two quickly toot'd bags, we finally looked at each other and could not stop laughing.",1396413714.0

I saw a couple posts but nothing really was like this that I saw, sorry if I'm wrong.

But I have one kind of about each, the close call one was crazy so I'll start with that. 

A few years ago when GPS systems came out for cars, they were a hot item that pawn shops would buy and people on craigslist were searching for, for a low price of anywhere from 40-100. I know now, no one is going to pay anywhere near that because damn near every phone has Google maps on it.  So anyway, I used to walk around my neighborhood and friends' neighborhoods and walk home from them, following the railroad tracks home, taking every available path to a street or little neighborhood and hitting up every open car I could. After I exhausted all of my resources within a 10 minute drive of my house, I decided to take a drive out to where my girlfriends mom was living. This little, wealthy, out of the way town that had a lot of houses and a lot of cars. It's summer time and a lot of people for whatever reason feel extremely comfortable in the suburbs that people wont rummage through their unlocked vehicles. So I tell her, lets take the ride and she also gets high at the time, so she's all over the idea. After about an hour of getting what I can from cars I end up with about 3 GPS, a couple garmins and a TomTom. Not very successful if you ask me. I only went into cars that were already unlocked, and usually if I saw a GPS or Radar Detector hanging from the windshield. I rarely searched the trunk, backseat, or under the seats. Why? I don't know. I wanted to get in and out as quickly as possible I guess. So she picks me up and I put the items on a certain someone's list online and give a bogus location of where I'm located. in the complete opposite direction of where I was that night. That next day, I'm getting emails about this TomTom that I had found. This lady seems interested but shes working til later, this dude seems interested also, so obviously I'm with the first come first serve policy.

After a couple hours of talking to this guy, my girlfriend wakes up and it's almost time to go meet this guy, he says he is coming from really far out of the way and I say I'm coming from really far out of the way from the opposite direction, he gives a meeting spot of WalMart literally 5 minutes from where I actually am. My girlfriend and I start arguing and she gets in her car, puts this TomTom and a radar detector under the tire and put her car in reverse. I'm at this point yelling at her to stop being a fucking retard, she's about to run over the only money we have, she wants me to stop calling her names... many dudes can probably relate to this... shes doing something dumb, and wants me to stop telling her that she's doing something dumb. Anyway, she takes her foot off the gas and I hear the slightest crunch. So again, she gets the barrage of ""You fucking retard, bitch, dumbass, etc."" She gets out of the car and the TomTom I was about to sell has a spider webbed screen. You've got to be fuuuuucking kidding me. I'm looking in her car and her friend had left her Tomtom in her glove compartment, the exact same one. So I say, hey, you know we're going to sell her Tomtom now right? She gives in, I ended up getting her a much nicer one anyway. But We get to the meeting place. He says to me ""I'm over by the fence."" So we mosey over to the fence and I'm sick as fuck but I'm trying to act as cool as possible. I park a couple spots away from him, hop out with it in hand everything is gravy. So he says ""It's not hot is it?"" I'm like ""What?"" he says ""It's not stolen is it?"" And I obviously respond ""No absolutely not, I just got a garmin with a bigger screen and have no use for this TomTom"" He says ""Ohh, ok. Because mine just got stolen last night."" I'm leaning on his big ass redneck as fuck red pickup truck looking into his truck to see what the fuck he's doing. He's pulling out the box for his tomtom that had gotten stolen the previous night. So I played it off cool and asked where he lived. And he responded with the town I had stolen it from. I was in shock, stuck between shitting my pants and cracking up laughing. He then pulled out the serial number for his Tomtom and started searching through the settings looking for the serial number. Luckily, when my girlfriend and I got into the fight, she ran over this guys tomtom. So after they didn't match up, he very reluctantly handed me the $40, I seriously think knowing the whole time that I had stolen his tomtom. 

I'm still not sure what would have happened had my gf not ran over his tomtom. If he would have called the cops or just beat my junkie ass at the time. Closest call I ever had probably.

As far as big scores go...

Got lucky one night after I had ran through a neighborhood looking for GPS. Had about 3 but a disappointing night because at this point they were kind of not worth more than $20 if you could find somone to buy it. Pawn shops were onto the scam and stopped buying them.

So I decide to hit one more street. I turn down the street, first house, nice house. SUV in the driveway with no light, perfect. I open the door, and the keys are in the ignition dinging like a motherfucker, so I take them out and put them in my pocket. I look in the side panel, center console, glove box, other side panel... nothing. Check the center console again and im moving shit around. on top there's a bank envelope. Perrrrfect. I pull out one bill, $100. Great. I got 100$ at least. Let me get my ass outta here. I continue down the street, waiting to see if there's anything I can into. I stop under a street light, look at a middle bill. $50. I got $150 at least. Let me get the fuck home, so I run back home jumping in the ditch any time a car comes. It's about 3am I'm in all black. I'm going to get the cops called on me. I get home, and to my surprise it wasn't a $50. It was another $100. $6,000 in an unopened car. You can imagine my excitement... I was really into fentanyl at this time so most of my money went to that. 

I have a few more stories, like when I went upstate because I dressed like a girl and robbed a gas station. Almost getting caught boosting from walmart. But I got knocked at the gas station so that's not a close call.

Should I just be using my Oxy/Percs as I normally take them or should I mix them with my Fentanyl 50mcg Patches?  And when I mean ""mix them"", I mean that by should I put a patch on and then chew some Oxy?  Is it worth it?  Does it help with the high at all or would it just up my tolerance considerably without a noticeable high increase?

Or should I just use up the Oxy/Percs and then use the Fentanyl for the rest of the month?  What is the best way to use the Fentanyl?  I don't seem to be getting anything from just wearing the patches.  I had even thrown one of the 25mcg Fentanyl Patches that I had left over so I was wearing a total of 75mcg and I still hadn't noticed anything at all.  I wasn't even getting tired.  

I know some people are going to suggest ""gumming"" the Fentanyl.  When I originally got these patches, I was 100% against doing this.  However, I need to at least not be dope-sick when my Oxy runs out.  My pain is so severe that dealing with both the pain and dope-sickness would be fucking catastrophic.  So now I'm considering gumming the patches.

So here is the info on the Fentanyl Patches that I have:
1. They are not ""gel"" patches.
2. I have 25mcg and 50mcg patches (because my Dr. upped the dosage and I have some of the original ones left).
3. They are thin patches that are tape-like on the back.
4. Says ""Manufactured by AVEVA"" and then says ""Manufactured For: Apotex Corp., Weston, FL""
5. 50 mcg/h ""In vivo delivery of 50 mcg/h fentanyl for 72 RX only""
6. ""Each transdermal system contains: 5.52 mg fentanyl""

How much should I try gumming?  How long?  At what point should I take it out?  Any and all advice/information is appreciated.

Part one has a shit ton of typos and was really rushed to those of you who haven't read it. Also, the more interesting part of the story unfortunately wasn't included in part one. My SO's experience after he left me at the hourly ""hotel"". But that's a story for a different time. For now, I give you part two. 

The morning...we still had to get through the night. We walked disheartenedly back to the car. The prior adrenaline was waning quickly and there was no longer any determination in our movement, only bitter disappointment.

I had called my father several times during the ordeal, keeping him updated as best I could, making sure he didn't worry. He was probably too worn out too care. I told him we would have to wait until the morning to get something, but that we could get it as soon as 5am. He said that was fine, but there was no emotion in his voice. I was too sick to dwell on it. I told him that the guy we were with had a house and gave him a fake address. Truth be told, I didn't know where we were going to sleep. Not that this was anything new.

""Where can we sleep tonight, man?"" I didn't want to sleep in my car. I'd been driving around for far too long and I needed to stretch my legs.

""We can go to this abandoned building I know of. There are people there, but it will be cool.""

We were more than quick to agree. We'd done worse, and we just needed an actual place to rest. We had enough Klonopin left for that night, so at least we would sleep. We *needed* to sleep. We drive and it's dark. I couldn't tell where I was, but the surroundings weren't exactly pretty. But this was supposed to be my last hurrah to plunge into the adventurous abyss, so at this point I just sat back and enjoyed where it took me. I followed along, with nostalgia as my guide. I almost didn't even care that I was sick. This was my last mission before I kicked and I was going out with a bang. I thought I was somehow special. I thought that I was somehow brave, that I could handle my shit at nearly 20 years old. Even if most of it was probably just luck or some form of divine intervention. Ah, to be young and stupid.

We got the blankets we had together and parked in a gravel lot behind a building that looked like only the hand of Satan could be holding it together. As the gravel crunched under my feet all I could think about was rest and that sweet normalcy I would feel only 6 to 7 hrs from now. We crawled under the fence and entered through a tarp door. It was pitch black and although I couldn't see, I could feel building swallowing me whole. I groped with my hands in front of me and felt no fear, only sickness and benzos. The hall was suddenly illuminated by the hiss of a Bic lighter. We climbed stair after stair. My legs felt like 100lb barbells. All of the copper was ripped from the walls and we stumbled our way through the debris. We were now are on what I thought was the third floor. I made out a fluorescent light at the end of the hall. It was bright and haunting.

He had to introduce us to the squatters that stayed there and said that they'd be cool. I didn't care. Was it odd to feel like I could act more natural and free to be myself around addicts more so than other people? I have always had an acute sense to judgment I guess.

The smell of smoke hit my hypersensitive nose. Meth was being smoked. We followed the source of light like moths in the dark. We finally got to the doorway and entered the room. The vapor caressed my face uncomfortably.

""These people are going to spend the night. They're cool. They brought some weed from Cali and they'll smoke us out.""

They looked up, but didn't seemed moved. It was almost as if we were ghosts that they had been expecting. There were 3 of them. They were all young, but weathered. None of them could have been very far past 30. The guy with the light had a pipe in his hand. It was a contraption that I had never seen before. It curved like a lamp that I once clipped to my night stand, or maybe like a large bendy-straw, if it was all bend and no straw. He bent it appropriately and torched the bowl. His head lamp moved accordingly. It hurt my eyes. There was a couch and a coffee table. The rest was bare beside the rubble and trash. There was a bottom of a can that was full of a sticky black residue that I had never encountered before. We didn't have a pipe for the weed, so we had to make one out of aluminum foil. We loaded a bowl and tried our best to make conversation. Then the bowl was cashed and so were we. They barely looked up at us as we left the room and they loaded their contraption.

The lighter hissed again and guided our way down the hall, as we kept our balance on the banister. I entered to doorway robotically swept the drywall from the floor and laid down the comforter. The kid was happy to have company. He said he hadn't smoked weed in a long time. He seemed intelligent and he wasn't bad company. We had a few benzos left and gave him one and ingested the rest, along with a couple colonodine. We made conversation and my voice caressed the barren walls and fell off into the darkness. We talked about all the shit we had been through. The normal trials and tribulations of any junky on the street. My heart rate slows and I can hear it beat through the silence around me. I fall asleep.

I woke up suddenly to my phone ringing beside me, and grudgingly answer it. It was my dad. He said it was 5:00am, my phone says 4:00. I didn't believe him. I was too exhausted to realize it never switched over from Juarez. I passed back out and woke up with a start, realizing we should have been up a long time ago. We had to throw something at the kid to wake him up. I vaguely remembered him saying something about it the night before. We get in the car and race over to the border. The line to get in is nearly an hour long. All I could hear was the high pitched whir of fast spoken Spanish all around me. I was running out of time and starting to worry. I craned my neck as if it would magically make the line go faster. It didn't. There seemed to be no end. By body was working against me and I tried to pull myself together. I just wanted to be well.

After exchanging our currency twice and the hourly room from the night before, we had less money and couldn't get as much dope, but we still needed to somehow get that room. It was where the kid stashed his new rigs and it was an ideal spot to fix. We walked to the motel and saw that there is a different guy working the front. He had a malicious look in his eye as soon as we approached the counter. We handed him the 50 or so pesos and he proceeded to tell us that the room is now 100 pesos an hour. We told him that was a lie and 50 is the regular rate. We told him we didn't have enough money and that he was a liar. He said that we either payed or we didn't get the room. We pleaded and begged. He didn't care. Why would he? We were just junkies. No sympathy. 

Now we have no works and no where to fix. The kid says he knows where we can go, but that it's not the ideal spot. I didn't care. I just wanted to get well.Before we got to the meeting spot, the kid told us to be careful. He explained how most of these guys are only buying a hit each and that even though we weren't buying a lot, it was a lot to them and they wouldn't have any qualms about robbing us. We walked to the bazaar and I realized that I was almost out of cigarettes. There were about 20 junkies all lined up and waiting out in the open, as if we were just waiting for the mall to open on Black Friday. They were more animal than human. Their eyes were hard and looked like flint. Nobody talked. We were all just tigers in a cage. 

There is one other guy waiting who is white and clean cut. We asked him how long it had been. He said he had been waiting for an hour. It wouldn't have mattered when we showed up. He and the kid reminisced about Juarez as we stood by idly. 

I didn't even notice the Man show up. All of a sudden everyone is running and shouting, and I'm pushed along with an the angry mob. At some point it was our turn and we got our bags The kid told us to follow him. There was a desolate shell of a building right behind the meeting spot. It was all concrete and had no ceiling. It served solely as a shooting gallery. We squeezed through the entrance with the other sick junkies all scrabbling to find our spot. They suddenly noticed our presence and started to yell at us in Spanish, surrounding us like rabid dogs ready to bite. We handed them the rest of our pesos and explained that we were ""muy malos"". That calmed most of them down, but some of them didn't notice and continued to try and push us out. I'm shouting in broken Spanish that I already paid and finally make it to one of the ""rooms"". There are 10 other junkies already there and someone brings in a large zip-lock bag full of used outfits. We waited patiently until one of the smiled at us and dug out the worst one he could find, giving it to me and my SO to share. There was a slight nagging in the back of my mind that felt like worry, but I brushed away like an irritating fly. I didn't care, I just needed it in the vein. My stomach quivered with anticipation as it went into the bottom of the can and SO slowly drew it up. It was a little cold and he had a hard time hitting as dull as the point was. 

I was excited and speaking broken Spanish to everyone around me, they were mostly friendly now, and sympathized as they got well. It was strange how easy the communication was between us, even with the language barrier. We were all in the same boat, trying not to sink. There were other people helping each other hit and most of them couldn't have been very old. My SO finally drew up my shot. The barrel of the rig was clear with no hint of the numbers that used to be on it. I used a shoelace to tie off and my SO felt around for a vein. A junky with an abscess on his neck started talking to us. He was trying to ask my SO if he could help him hit. My SO was happy and high, and making false promises. He told the guy he would, after he hit me. I don't even remember registering, but I do remember that release. A sweep of warm, gentle caresses entered my body and I smiled and nodded my head.

Everyone was breathing sighs of relief by this point and shouting things like, ""Curación!"" and ""La Cura!"" as if thanking some opioid deity up above. At some point during this ordeal my dad must of called. My phone answered in my pocket and he must have heard the shouting. 

We got up to leave and the kid was nodding. He had a two bag shot to himself. I was jealous. As we exited the junky with the abscess chases after us. He was angry. He wildly gestured, seemingly upset left without hitting him. There was no time now. My SO was on the phone with my dad and we had to get back to the other side. I kept repeating, ""No mas tiempo,"" but he was not be persuaded. He continued to shout and wave his arms angrily as he followed us to the border. He tried to grab the phone, but he was weak and sickly. He then went for my SO's wallet, and it was easily retrieved. We showed him that we had no money. I kept apologizing profusely. We walked into a more populated area near the border. He gave up at last, bitterly muttering threats under his breath, with a look of pure hatred in his eye as he walked away, discouraged and disappointed. We had wasted his time and kept him from his shot. I wondered why he couldn't have someone else help him. Maybe it was the principle. 

The line for the border was just as long on this side. We shared our last Camel as we waited, enjoying this last moment of relief. My SO still had a bag in his mouth, but they hopefully wouldn't notice at the border. The guard that was checking I.D.'s gave us a hard time about not having a passport, and I was slightly worried, but he finally let us go, warning us that it might be different next time. But there wouldn't be a next time.

On our way back to the car, we chatted about getting high and acted as if we would see each other again soon. He didn't want to see us go. I could see his eyes harden as we said our good-byes, and he turned back to real time. Junk-time. The world was a lonely place for a street junky and though he was older than me, he was still just a kid. I hope he made it out okay. Maybe we'll always be chasing ""La Curación"".",1396381271.0

Still a little high from the Hydrocodone, but what I'm really concerned about is Acetametophine OD. I can urinate but it was a bit difficult. Like I had to work really hard to get it out. Is throwing up a bad sign or does it help? I drank about 160ml bottle and as stated it was 5-1.5. My shitty math with the 1.5 * how many doses (teaspoon) calculates that to be 35-40mg. But that seems pretty low. 
Can someone tell me how much I actually ingested? Will eating something help? 

I'm not nodding off. Just really unfocused, in and out, kinda in a half state of panic. I gotta drive in 3 hours. 

So over the course of 2 or 3 hours I gradually finished the amount stated above. I only had a few sips for the first hour and a half but wasn't feelin much. So I just casually finished the bottle between hour 2-3. I had a small glass of wine at around the 3rd or 4th hour. It is approaching hour 6 and I'm feelin real chill but not sure I should fall asleep. Can I take caffeine to counter the effects?

My really close friend, who I live with, he thinks that he is dying right now. I'm not talking about anxiety or anything. I'll start this story from the beginning of the symptoms.

About a week or so ago I woke up one morning and had some bad symptoms. Every breath that I took hurt, my entire chest had a sharp pain, my shoulders did too, especially the fronts of my shoulders/collar bones. The pain worsened as I breathed deeper. On top of this breathing pain, I had some really bad phlegm in my throat, I was trying to cough it up all day but coughing it up hurt a lot. Before you cough you have to inhale deeply, and that's when I experienced the most pain. Well, that day was hell, the next day the pain subsided a little, and wasn't as bad. The third day the pain subsided more and was nothing more than a dull ache once I inhaled all the way in. On the fourth day it was completely subsided. After it went away, I stopped worrying about it, nothing has been wrong since the. 

2 days ago my friend experienced the same thing that I did. He told me that he woke up that morning and he said that he was having the same pain I did the other day. The first day of his it was pretty bad, but yesterday he woke up again and it was worse, and all day it as been so bad to the point that he is groaned and was in so much pain he had to go to the hospital. He left first going to the walk in clinic they told him they literally can't do anything and recommended he go to the ER. He went to the ER and got an EKG and a a chest Xray. It turns out that the doctor just told him he had pleurisy and wasn't entirely sure what is going on with him. 

Regardless, he had to get a shot, it helped him for maybe 8 hours, but it started going away and his pain started coming back. I'm really concerned for him because I can tell how much pain he's in and it hurts me to see him that way because I care about him a lot and don't want anything to happen. 

He is a heroin user, like I am, but he uses IV, and I don't. I'm wondering since we both experienced the same thing from using this dope. Just, his was much worse. Does anyone know what else this might be, or have any similar stories of a condition like this brought on while you were using dope?

Thank you, and please, everyone think positive things for my bestfriend. He's really suffering a lot. I heard him waking moaning and kind of yelling in pain back in his room. I opened the door, and could tell just by looking into his eyes how much pain he is in and how awful this is.

I'm rooooooooooocked on a combo and am not going to sleep for a while. Combo info/ story time inside,"So today I woke up and the plan was to pick up first thing in the AM. My girl was coming down to pick me up but I had an hour to kill so i ended up scraping all my bags and got a little less than a point which I shot and got me well but nowhere near high. We get down to T-town and meet and my dude. Stamp was ""sour diesel."" We go to our usual parking lot right outside the city to fix up. I do a 5 bag shot into a vein in my top wrist/hand area. Even though I didn't miss it immediately started to swell and hurt really bad. Every time I shoot in my hand this happens. It's such a pain in the ass. I just found out today that it's probably because of all the nerves in that area. So anyway, I feel nothing...nada..zilch. My girl did her normal amount, didn't miss, and feels nothing either. What the fuck...this dude never has bad shit and I'm loyal to him so I sent him a text letting him know it was garbage and not to pick it up again.

Fast forward a few hours. I'm alone and bored so I see if maybe I can get some sort of nod going out of the 5 bags I had left. But this time I added a little heat and...bam! I got that rush. It worked! So I text my dealer again and tell him to let his customers know to add a little heat.

Since I was now out of dope I decided I needed to pick up again and my options were a) good quality local stuff for $10/bag or b) take an hour drive up to P-town for $4 bags/$40 buns. I think about it for a minute and I'm thinking...my birthday is coming up so I'm gonna have a lot of money coming my way soon. I have $200 left in my bank account and I hit my homie who I cop with up to ask what he can get me a brick for. $180. So I say why the fuck not, I'll end up spending that and more over the next two weeks driving all around and picking up a bun a day in T-town like I usually do. 

So I drive up to homie, scoop him up, scoop up another homie and we all roll to P-town to get that shit. All goes well and for the first time I get to see what a beautiful nicely packaged brick of fine NJ ECP looks and feels like. And it's all MINE!! Feelsgoodman. Purple stamp ""King Heroin"" Has good reviews all around and I have had it before and was pleased so I was excited to get a nice amount while it's still around. 

Get back to my hood and meet up with this kid I recently made friends with and he wants to buy some bags from me so I jack up the price a bit but it's still lower than the only other dealer he knows in the area with the $10 bags. We hang out in a safe parking lot and wait for my other friend to come meet up with us. I do 2 shots of molly maybe 15 min apart with about a point in each. Got a really nice rush and roll going. When I started to come down I did a nice 5 bag shot of dope and just chain smoked and bullshitted with my boy. Other friend shows up and we are just hanging out. I decided to sniff a bag because I haven't done that in a while. I also decided that since my high was starting to wear off I'd pop a klonopin under my tongue to try to stretch the nod a bit. It works. I now only have one eye to function with and it was half shut so more like .5 of an eye. We eat some candy and snacks and eventually it's like 2am so its time to part ways. 

I head home and decide I'm not tired and not done getting fucked up for the night so I load up another 5 bag shot and scrape the last of my ketamine in there too.. maybe like a .05. Call my boy to stay on the phone with me while I do my shot cause I'm alone..I always do this and I highly recommend everyone else too as well, it can save your life. I do my shot and WOO!! nice rush from the K. Stuff starts moving and grooving like I'm tripping out and I'm nodding so hard in the weirdest position propped between my couch and a coffee table almost upside down at this point but I don't give a fuck cause I'm so rocked. Try to get up, fall over. Try to get up agan, succeed. Get my laptop and pack of smokes and head out to the porch to chain smoke making sure I bump into every corner and door frame along the way. Plop my ass on my screened in porch and fuck around on this sub before the sleep demons take me. 

Well that was a long ass story and took me like an hour to write out because windows 8 + .5 eye + drugs and my cursor disappearing because I can barely see. Thank junkie jesus my laptop is touch-screen. My wrist is still fucking killing me do I'm about to put a hot towel on it.  Thanks for reading if you got this far. Good riddance and happy nods.

Want to hear what you guys feel like is the best thing to do.,"To start off, we are both young. It started with us smoking weed together like good little high schoolers. Then dabbling in a little codeine. Some time passed and my friend developed some pretty severe depression. Then a friend of ours started selling him oxys. I recognized that if I wanted to help him I had to keep him as close of a friend as possible, which meant I couldn't create a rift by outright telling him how his use bothered me. But fuck was I pissed that a friend would sell him oxys when he was in such a dark place. The summer came and it was hydro and opium. I was on 2cb when my friend offered me and our other best friend opium. I declined but made no move to stop him. I hope you never have to think about your friends freebasing opium for the first time at age 15 while tripping. Time passed, and my friend grew closer to people who were willing to do more drugs (I'm your typical weed + psychs fag) and who were willing to be put into sketchier and sketchier situations. I have recently started to spend more time with my friend again, and it has me worried. He now walks around with a bag of dilaudid and kpins. He still does opium occasionally. He is still depressed. He is still very young. He no longer has a job and has been selling various drugs here and there to pay for his own use. This feeling hangs over me, a feeling that this is a pivotal time in my friends life, two paths are clearly laid out in front of him. What, if anything, do you think I should do? I know I'm over protective but he is the closest thing to a brother I have. If he were to start down this path and end up in the ground or a cell because of it, I wouldn't be able to live with myself for not doing anything. At the same time I don't want to alienate him. If you were my friend, what could I do that would help you the most? Sorry as I'm sure this is extremely out of place as most people in this sub wouldn't bat an eye at this kind of thing. Perhaps because I don't trust myself with opiates I am unable to trust him with them. ",1396481433.0

We decided to take a 2 week break after getting high for 2 weeks in a row, the last day being sunday when we got high as tits. Monday night I took a xanax before bed and slept great. Last night I was awake all fucking night rolling back and forth and couldn't sleep for a minute, which I'm assuming is from some kind of minor withdrawal. At about 6pm I took about a third of an 8mg suboxone strip (somewhere between 2-3mgs) and this is my first time taking it. I wasn't really expecting to get high from it but right now I am seriously really high and it feels kind of like 20mg of oxycodone felt when I took it a long time ago with no tolerance and little experience with opiates. I'm feeling really good right now and I happen to have some xanax. I was thinking about taking some before I go to bed at about 10 (yeah i know its early but I need to get up a 6 everyday for work). I know mixing these two drugs can be very dangerous and fatal but would a really small dose be safe. Say I took half of a football (.25mg of alprazolam) 4 hours after I dosed the sub. Would I be okay? Am I safe to take the whole .5mg? I really don't know but I wanna sleep really well since I didn't last night. Note that I went almost 3 days without H before I took the sub, and I've taken .25mg of xanax 3-4 times over the last week so I don't think I really have a tolerance for that either.

My best homie is sometimes the biggest piece of shit, dude. I ALWAYS get him on EVERYTHING. Like he never has any fucking money and I'm the one with an extremely well paying job so he mooches like a motherfucker. When he's sick I'm not going to leave him in pain you know, he's my best buddy, I can't do that to him.

BUT. I don't have a car, so he's always the one driving everywhere, and I feel like he thinks he has power over me because of that.

So this one time my regular plug who delivers couldn't serve me so in the morning we had to drive maybe a MILE or TWO down to get a sack. I pick up a 40 and I get a 20 for the homegirl with us because it was her connect. She's extremely thankful, etc. We pull over to smoke and I get him on a few trays and I'm like already late for work so I tell him to take me to work. I take off a little piece like a few trays worth and give it to him, and he goes ""Dude what the fuck are you giving me? Thats IT?"" I go dude what the fuck I always do shit for you I just smoked you out and gave you a fatass piece what the fuck? He goes ""Bullshit dude I DO SO MUCH FOR YOU"" I go ""WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU DO FOR ME?"" And dude just got stupid fucking retarded heated, literally the only thing I ever ask of him is to drive and ONE time I got kicked out of my house and I asked him to pick me up, BUT AS A FRIEND HE SHOULD ALREADY DO SHIT LIKE THAT NO QUESTIONS ASKED. At least, in my fucking view. I would do it no questions asked. Anyway this piece of shit told me to get out of his car and I had to walk to work just because he was being a sketchy little faggot.

/END RANT


Honestly I don't know why I put up with his shit sometimes. He hangs stuff over me like nothing. Like the fact that he picked me up when I got kicked out is this big thing. He brings it up anytime I ask him why I have to keep getting him on food, drugs, ANYTHING. 

I just don't have the heart to leave him to be sick and unwell. I really don't. Besides that we get along well. It's just these few times where he turns into the greediest scum I've ever met. As if he's BETTER than me somehow because he drives or because he did ONE thing for me.

im sure someone else has thought of this since fent, and moreso its analogs, have a small enough dosage that they could be put on blotters and i cant think of a way that people down the chain could cut it to make more money and then end up fucking it up and killing people, aside from dissolving and ... whatever process you use to apply it to more paper.

because it would be unmistakably fent, and people could just cut a strip off if they wanted to gum it or put the paper n a spoon if they wanted to shoot it, i think this could seriously reduce the umber of OD's as well as moving drug money away from shitty parts of the world. heroin money is all ending up in the hands of some very shitty people because of the source countries of illicit poppy production.

the only real problem i can see is if the sheet were to get partially wet and the fent gets wicked deeper into the sheet causing a band of higher potency.

Looking for help.,"Some of you may have seen my thread about opana detox, now, I was under the impression I'd have one opana at least(one IR in the morning would be a fuckin' blessing) but I actually had less than I thought, today is going to be my first day opana free. Now, turns out I'm not without help, I do have a centrally acting narcotic to help me, but I'm not sure how hard or easy this is going to be, and the sense of dread is killing me.

What I'm going to do is list what I have(meds, things to ease it off best I can)

1 liter approx. of scotch/whiskey(750ml of Jameson, some left over Johnnie walker, I'm not much of a drinker, kind of worried to really get shitfaced because the possibility of a hang over but at the same time I feel like I have to get a buzz on SOMETHING, this is problematic)

Klonopin, not sure how many tablets but plenty to get me to Wednesday(when I get more Opana)(legit script as well)
Halcion(again, not sure on the numbers but plenty, this one is fantastic for sleep)
Seroquel 200mg instant release(in case shit gets real bad, otherwise i'm not touching it)
Lyrica+Gabapentin, plenty of
immodium(everyone has this for days/weeks like this)

And to top it off, up to 5 7.5mg/325 mg Norco's, per day, maybe more on the first few days(my mom is helping me here, I legitimately have a potentially terminal genetic disease so absolute full on w/d could prove fatal, this is how I get opana anyway, and the benzos, normally I'd also have xanax but thats on a different fill cycle and so I'm out of xanax bars for the time being) 


Annnd here's what I'm coming off of, a 60mg(on a real, real slow day) habit of opana(more often 100 or even 160mg, but 60 is what I'm actually prescribed, and that 100-160mg--which is what I take most of the time--can be shot or just snorted, usually the latter since my veins are shit and shooting just leads to a shorter lasting high for me, and a golden rush that I need to stay away from)


How well am I set? I could use a guru to guide me, exercise is problematic since I am seriously prone to joint dislocations(happens almost every day, usually a toe or finger, but sometimes a shoulder and even my femur before).



Obviously the long night lies ahead, or well, it's creeping up on me and has been.

I currently use the following method to prepare PST:

1. Empty 2 liter
2. Fill up 2/3 with poppy seeds
3. Add approx 1 cup grapefruit juice (for taste)
4. Add approx 1 cup lemon juice
5. Fill the rest almost to the top with water
6. Put cap on and shake for about 5 - 10 minutes
7. Slightly unscrew cap and pour into container
8. Repeat steps 3-7 one or two more times (second and third pass)

Now, this method has served me well enough, but I am lazy and find this to be a very time-consuming method. I am wondering:

1.) Is there a similar method that can produce a larger volume of tea in a similar amount of time?

2.) Approx how long would my tea last before it either spoils or degrades to a point of being useless?

3.) How can I preserve the tea?

4.) Is it possible to extract the tea into a smaller volume, ie by boiling the product? My thinking is that this would ruin the tea because the heat would cause the happy molecules to break down into unhappy molecules.

But as a junkie ( as I'm sure you all understand ), I am forced to choose between succumbing to mg cravings, and take another bowl, or stick through it and have some lovely morning/afternoon stuff... 

Now, I know the obvious answer is to save.. I guess I just want reassurance.. 


SO to make this a bit more interesting... I would like to ask & hear your responses regarding this question: 



Would you rather have bedtime nods or morning shot(s)? 


Adding onto that, do you feel you live ""more in the 'now'"", or "" in the 'later'""? (Does your future self love your 'yesterday' or 'past' self? Or do you always hate yesterday self?) 


Thanks for listening & answering!  I'm genuinely curious! And restless... And lonely..  ( At least I get a big ol' double bed for my kitty & I! :3 )",1396594087.0

I tried all drugs at least once and found psychedelics were my favorite.  I abused psychedelics for months until I started getting anxiety attacks.  So I figure I should slow down my drug use and only use responsibly.



I moved to speeding  (responsibly) to help focus on studies.   Eventually the comedowns started getting to me.  So I would use heroin when the depression got really bad.  Heroin always makes me want to sleep for days.  So, I still didn't like heroin. 



And fast forward now... speed is losing its lustre, I'd rather not deal with any depression.



Lately, heroin no longer makes me sleep for days.  Instead I'll nod maybe an hour or two then I'll be energized.  I already know I'm hooked.




Brain keeps telling me to try the needle.  I still remember the first time; snorting small ass bumps.  Gave me a mad rush to the head, nodding and not remembering the next 4 hours, and the hangover the following days.  I know the only way to get that again is by a needle.



And another thing.  I used to be so scared of benzos, because I read they are the deadliest to withdraw from.  Told myself, I'll never touch benzos.  I mixed them with heroin for the second time today.



I used to be a careful fella.  Said that it's okay to use drugs as long as I do it privately, at home.  Today, I snorted H at the school bathroom, popped a benzo, and chased it down with speed.





Well played heroin.. Well played.",1396593616.0

She has been on and off since I was 16 years old. It has caused me severe anxiety, attachment issues, and mistrust in people that I care about. She really is a kind-hearted woman, and I think that most people who use opiates probably are. They want to internalize the pain they feel rather than unleash it on others, and so they use. Because when they use, they don't feel anything. In a sense, it is a weird type of compassion. I love my mother. I will always love my mother. But her addiction is destroying her. She can't hold on to money (which really hurts me since I am in college), she can't hold a job, she sells belongings and furniture that don't belong to her so she can pay for her addiction (one time, when I was 16, she sold my dog for a fix), etc. I still love her though. I should point out that her addiction started innocently enough. She had an operation that required her to take percs, and then it just progressed from there. A few weeks ago, my mother OD'd. It wasn't her first, but it was definitely the closest call we've had. /r/opiates, please...Don't glorify this. This is not who you are. Most of you I'm sure are struggling.

The last 5 years or so of my life have been an ongoing battle against opiates, a losing battle for the most part. I started swallowing a Vicodin here and there, then started chewing on Percocet, on to snorting Roxies, OCs and Opanas, and finally culminating to where I am now, shooting heroin.

I've done all the ""normal"" terrible things, and have learned to sleep at night, however today I crossed an invisible line and I know it.

Here is the story:
In the process of doing the ""normal"" terrible things I was arrested a few times. The first time I was in the wrong place at the wrong time doing a friend a favor. I went to his house to drop off one Roxy, and his neighbors house was being watched for selling heroin. This was long before I knew about heroin and I was certainly naive to the type of neighborhood I was in. Unfortunate for me though I pulled up directly in front on the undercover mini-van that was posted up watching the house down the block. My friend ran outside, I dropped a pill in his hand, and we were both promptly arrested. It was my friends first time in trouble, he was charged with possession and got a quick ACOD. I was charged with two B felonies for sale and possession. From here on out everything just slowly got worse and worse in my life, this was 2010.

After the first arrest, I was outed to my parents who had to come get me out of jail and be subjected to the system. I was put into an outpatient clinic and started to take Suboxone. The first month or two went pretty well, I was taking the medication as directed and attending the groups. Then I decided to start using sometimes, and trying not to fail the urine tests. My best option legally at this point was to enter something called Felony Drug Treatment Court, a program that exists where I live that if you complete their 18 month long program they will drop all the charges. The only problem is that they take the program VERY seriously, and to enter you must plead guilty and accept the maximum penalty for the crimes you are charged with. This was about 10 years for me, and I could not be taking Suboxone while in this program. The legal plan was for me to finish the Suboxone treatment and enter the Felony Drug Treatment Court. Since I was not taking the Suboxone correctly and I was using about 50% of the time this was a difficult maneuver for me. After about a year of dodging the courts and faking piss tests everything finally caught up with me, I failed a few drug tests and was referred to a higher level of care.

I went to a 28 day inpatient program in a hospital and came out a better person for a while. I started a new outpatient program and was doing well. The judge at the Felony Drug Treatment Court however saw me as a problem, and decided for me that his particular program wouldn't work for me. At the time this seemed like bad news, I wasn't going to be able to have my charges dismissed, but in hindsight, it was a very good decision for I would 100% be in prison right now.

I put together a decent stretch of sobriety at this point. I left the 28 day program, attended meetings regularly on top of the court mandated outpatient program. At just about 4 months clean and sober I decided to start using again. I started dodging urine tests and counting hours, and was doing pretty well with that. Until about 2 weeks away from completing the program everything caught up once again and I was kicked out. The judge was getting a little fed up at this point, as well as my lawyer, parents, DA, girlfriend, friends, etc. I was told I had to enter another program as soon as possible and get back on track. So I did the logical thing and kept using everyday and rescheduling the intake for outpatients.

At this point I was very much out of control, shooting about $200 worth of Roxies a day. One particular night I was sick as a dog and broke as a joke, a lethal combo. I scrounged up $30 to get one Roxy, and as I'm pulling away from the guys house I see the red lights behind me. I chewed on the pill and was charged for the needles I had on me. I got a DAT for possession in the 7th, and the cops gave me $10 to take a cab back to the car. I knew this was bad, and would complicate my other case badly. So I did the responsible thing and went off the deep end. ( I am taking a quick break right now to shoot a bag. )

At this point I spoke to my lawyer and she assured me I was in a terrible situation. Having already plead guilty both felonies my next court date was for sure going to end with me leaving in handcuffs out the back. I was 24 years old when I got this news, and I cried and begged my lawyer to figure something out. I called my case manager for the treatment programs and cried to him about how I needed help not prison. Although I was told I had little to no chance, both my lawyer and case manager suggested a long term inpatient program in the city. Due to a stroke of magnificent luck, the ADA was on vacation and the judge decided that because she wasn't there to fight it and since I had never tried a treatment program of this magnitude that we would give it a shot.

I was sentenced to 6 - 9 months of intensive inpatient care. I personally decided at this point to take my recovery seriously. About 3 weeks in to the new program I was doing great, I was sent to detox and then entered a program for young adults, aged 18 - 24. The house I was living in held about 65 people. I am a skinny white suburban heroin addict. The program was about 75% marijuana addicted ethnic teens trying to beat indictments for selling crack or heroin to undercover cops. Almost all of whom were gang affiliated as well. So while I didn't mind the diversity, I was most definitely out of my element. I didn't let this get my down though, and after 3 weeks or so I was heading back home for the morning to go to court. On my way to court I powered on my cell phone for the first time a while and called my lawyer to find out what to expect. Unfortunately, the ADA who was on vacation when I was granted entry to inpatient program was back from her vacation.

I spent my entire 7 month inpatient stay battling this women, who had developed a personal vendetta against me. My first court date in the program she tried relentlessly to have me removed from the program because ""it was a mistake that I was not incarcerated"". I did however for the length of my stay in the program take it 100% seriously. I finished early not because I was trying to get out but because I was serious, and spent every minute working on myself and trying to learn new things. The program offered a lot for the underprivileged younger kids, GED programs, Vocational Training, etc, that I did not need to take advantage of. Since I had a leg up I used my time productively. I read at least a book a week, found productive sober hobbies, I was put in charge of the house and delegating all of its required functions, and took many, many, groups. My lawyer was proud of me, my parents, my friends, my case manager, everyone except for the ADA. The ADA had a personal grudge against me and decided that based on my previous history I would eventually fuck up again. So she refused to return phone calls regarding my case, even came to the court room to go on the record and say ""I would like it put on the record that frenemieswithheroin is a failure to this program and it is a mistake that he is not incarcerated"".

My last court date before I completed my long term inpatient program my lawyer was able to get this ADA to finally show up court so they could have a conference with the judge and decide what to do with my charges. This is a normal procedure that usually runs about 5 minutes for a complicated case, my case went on for 40 minutes. People in the court room were whispering ""What the fuck is going on up there?"" and ""Who are they talking about?"". All said and done I had completed the program without getting in trouble once, I had stellar recommendations for the programs director, and the department heads of the subsidiaries I volunteered with. I was told that if I kept doing the right thing, that things would change and I would be rewarded. My lawyer came back and said that best she could do is to maybe get me a conditional discharge and I wouldn't be on probation, but either way I was definitely about to be convicted of both.

Today was my last court date. I was finally after 4 long years sentenced. My lawyer after 10 months of trying to no avail finally managed to work some sort of magic and talked the ADA into budging. My B Felony charge for Sale of A Controlled Substance was dismissed, and my B Felony charge for Possession of A Controlled Substance was dropped to a Misdemeanor Possession and sealed. I received 3 years misdemeanor probation. My lawyer cried when judge sentenced me, The judge came down from the bench to address me on the same level and tell me how happy she was with my success, and even the ADA stopped scowling at me for a moment. I cried too, because while this whole thing was going on I was high. I like the predictable asshole I am went out and fucked everything up when I got bad news, and now I'm in my usual shitty situation with a habit ready for everything to catch up to me.

Anyways, I just wanted to get all this shit off my chest, I'm sorry if you actually read the whole the thing.

TL;DR I was an asshole, Turns out, Still Am.",1396688093.0

I live in a city of like 40k people so knew there was dope to be had. I just had no idea where to look/cold cop. I moved into a new place and was talking to a new roommate when he informed me that he had some connects to different things. So tonight i decided it was time to give him a shot. We sat and waited in my car for what was supposed to be 10-15 (which we all know that really means 30-45 mins dealer time, lol). So finally dude shows up and things happen real quick so i didn't have much of a chance to check them out (them being 2 dubs). All I did know is that they felt hard and rocky. So I finally make it home after about another 20 mins. I get a glass plate and proceed to cut open my bags. To my suspicion/suprise the dope was rocky and a stright up gray. Like a medium to dark gray color. I've never seen dope that color before so I was a little worried. But i trusted the guy that hooked me up so crushed it up and did a small bump to gauge the strength of it. I hadn't had a shot since like 9 that morning (and it was around 9pm) so I said fuck it and mixed up a shot. It mixed to a very light brown color.

Normally one 8 mg sub will get me good, but not necessarily where I want to be. If you will just wash your mouth out with mouth wash and then dry the area with a towel or your shirt. It's important to put it directly between your lip and gums with a dry mouth. You won't initially feel it melt at all. That's what you're going for. It will take thirty minutes or more to start really breaking down. It will be sitting along that large vein in your lip. Don't swallow anything though until you start feeling the effects. Afterwards swish it around and let it sit for a while. Gumming it though is the key. I feel like it's  upwards as twice as strong so try it with a smaller dose.

I do have some knowledge that I would like to share just because if there is even a slight chance this will help someone struggling, it is worth it. 

My experience with quitting has been a rough one, much like most everybody. To me, recovery starts when you start getting ideas about quitting. Whether you act on them immediately or not, the first conscious realization they you are out of control and need to slow down or stop completely is where the recovery process starts. When you finally decide it's time to give it a shot you have a few options:

*1)you can choose to detox by yourself with whatever method you are comfortable with. Lope, suboxone, clonodine, benzos, or cold turkey. It would be wise to try to taper down whatever substance you use as quickly as possible if you want to get clean quickly, otherwise if you have some time do a slow taper over maybe 2 weeks. 

*2)attempt an inpatient or outpatient rehab. Inpatient is really good with helping you manage withdraws and just getting you away from all the things that can trigger you.  IOP (intensive outpatient programs) are the other option as a rehab program. They will help you manage withdraws and council you and help you talk about what you're going through. They will help you deal with the shit you're going through at the time. 

*3) NA/AA/SMART or whatever other recovery groups. These are greatly overlooked by a lot of people. Some are turned away by the god aspect, and some just don't believe it can work. It really is one of the best options. You can combine this with the next option I detailed if you want. To get this to work, you really gotta take it seriously. You have to get a sponsor, work the steps if it's a 12 step program. And just be honest. 

*4) the last option is getting on a opiate replacement program. With these you can get suboxone of methadone to maintain while you work out your life. It basically is just something to put off dealing with withdraw and make you feel normal for as long as you want to stay on it.

The only thing you really need to make any of this work is the desire to be clean. If you don't want it and are forced into any of these, you will most likely fail. Even if you only kind of want it, that is enough to start with. You will most likely fail, relapse, and start over many many times. The key is to never give up. Even if you get right back into it where you left off, using every day and feeling like you cant do it, just try again. Each time you attempt to get clean again it will remind you how miserable you would be if you kept using. It will most likely take you numerous attempts to finally get it, but you cant give up. It can and has been done by many people, so you can do it too.",1396673938.0

I have been waiting for someones dilaudid script to filled. Its been a strange day for me. Look, I know a shit-ton of people don't like reading whiny/self centered posts and I usually don't either but I just need for someone to listen because I don't feel comfortable talking about this to anyone I know.

I drive about half an hour to another city to pick up very overpriced pills a few times a month. I pay 2-3 times what most of you pay for dilaudid. I see many people say they would rather quit than pay these prices, and back when I payed 10 $ for 8 mgsi would have said that too. But it is all I can get and there is very little else I look forward to anymore. 

Now, I was court ordered to a long term rehab and the only one with a bed open at the time was a very very Christian place. This was a couple years ago. I have never really given much of a fuck about spirituality before this. But I must have a weak will because after hearing the same rhetoric and lessons and prayers over and over for 10 months allday everyday, I began to believe it. I eventually snapped out of it but honestly, I have this superstitious part of me that takes control when I am stressed or upset or feeling a strong emotion. Now, when I am playing the waiting game, I pray and pray to Jesus to help me get my shit. Weird huh? When I'm on my way to pick up, I pray and pray that I don't get pulled over, wreck my car, or break down.... and it always see.s to work. Today when I thought for sure it wasn't gonna happen after all,I prayed. Ans my dude called immediately and said he had em. 

On my way, I'm praying. Then I look down and see my cars running hot. I have to pull over. No coolant/water.huh... guess prayer is bullshit... pray anyway... immediately notice a creek I hadn't noticed at all. Fill car up with creek water then pray I make it to the dudes. Make it no issue. Then open hood again and all the coolant pours out immediately.fuck. at least I can get high. Shoot 24 mgs over the next hour or so. Call triple a and get home. Shoot another 8 mgs.not even feelingnthe slightest twinge of euphoria. Just mediocre Rush's. Why is this the only thing I look forward to... I cant get properly high. What the fuck is wrong with me? I don't even use much at all. Like 4-6 days broken up over a month. Broken up throughout the month...

Jesus please, I don't want to think like this but all pray and reach for more.dilaudid. ive accepted my love for dilaudid but I cant accept spending hundreds for being kinda high for two days. I don't even get sick anymore! Why am I so fixated? Why am I so convinced Jesus will help me get high? Everyday I work all day then go home and get drunk as shit. I don't mastutbate. I don't shower. I don't think I can even care about anything anymore.

Now I'm car-less I'm pretty sure.... my family thinks I'm clean. I think Jesus helps me get high. Cause laying in a scalding shower for an hour just trying to take a piss is what Nirvana is for me. God it all sounds so stupid and it is. What in the fuck am I trying to tell you? Thank God this is a throwaway.

Just made a throwaway to start posting to this thread as my other username would really giveaway who I am if anyone I know were to cleverly use google or recognize it on here. 

I live in Raleigh, NC. Ummm not really sure what to even say now that I'm here.

Insufulated 20 mg roxicodone about an hour ago and only have 5 mg to do later after that. Been on a roxi bend for about a week and a half. At least 50 mg a day. My tolerance is typically really, really, really low when I start a bender. I have never really had a solid habit in my life. I used to do a lot of methadone and vicodin but have always been in love with oxy. Never banged heroin but snorted some of it for the first time around last year. It gave me a headache so I'm not too sure if I liked it. I didn't even really get too much of a high. I go to the hospital at least once a month because of a condition and usually, almost always, get IV Dilaudid. Boy, is that the best feeling ever. I called and asked my doctor for it in pill form recently but since he has been giving me at least 20 oxy a week he is hesitant to start giving me a bunch of hydomorphone. I really want to try snorting it though. 

I'm afraid to be sick tomorrow but it is what it is. I've been trying to find at least an oxy connect in the Raleigh area for a while now. The dealer I used to have was just a friend who sold weed but started his own heroin habit after he met a stripper then found out they lived close to each other. I would go over and sometimes he'd sell me cheap bags (that's when I did my little snorting heroin experiment) but didn't like it. He sometimes, rarely, could get me roxi. He sold me 2 ER opana once and they were impossible to snort so I cut them into quarters and took them. I think they were 40 mg pills. 

I really want to get some dillies and opana soon. I've been trying a lot of different ways to see who sells or knows someone but have been coming up dry. I at least need an oxy connect.

Normally I am disappointed the day after I finish my 'extras' but then I am fine dosing the 60s and 15s for the rest of the (long) month.. Except for this month... I finished the 30s off four days ago and now my normal dose won't even get me completely well. It doesn't feel like I took anything at all (normally I get a small buzz going). 

Besides upping my dose and screwing myself at the end of the month, I'm not sure what to do. I plan on buying some dope later today to help. Thought about trying Tagamet, but I've  heard mixed things about it. 

You guys have any potentiation tips you can give me? I just want to feel normal :(

I really just hope my tolerance drops back to normal soon so I can get on with life. 

Just wanted to bitch and get some advice, thanks guys and gals!",1396794970.0

Time for a GGDD story.,"Sooo I have accumulated most of the ingredients to withdrawal fairly painlessly, with some help and some hard work. So those who doubted me can suck a fatty.



Anyways, I was fooling around cleaning up shit in my room last night when I found $20 in a pants pocket. I was hella stoked as I had helped some bropes cop off ma dude earlier and they had bought everything he had left, leaving me without stuff for today. I was hoping my regular guy would have the half g he owed me and could throw it in with a dub, but my calls and texts went unanswered today. The only time that happens is when he's out.

So I resigned to the fact that id just have to wait it out. I tore off a 2/3mg piece of sub and let it do its thing. I sent a text to my second string Dboy about an hour ago and what do you know.... He's on deck and tells me to come thru!




Only one problem... No car, and no friends that drive! I tell him my dilemma and get the too bad so sad text. Damn. BUT THEN! He texts asking my address, and after giving it to him, he sees we're only like 8 miles apart. He obviously took pity because he's on his way now to drop off a sack! And he said **he's bringing me donuts too!** MY. NIGGA.

Recently I've been ingesting other opiates and began to feel withdrawals when I stopped maybe 2-3 weeks ago. After about 4-7 days I've used once or twice which started up withdrawals again. The symptoms are manageable and nothing like when I quit H cold turkey. This cycle has happened probably about 3 times already. My question is if I keep doing this will my withdrawal symptoms lessen as time goes on. Say I do this for 2 months just using once every week or so will it wean down or am I just throwing gas into the fire? I couldn't find much info on this and am curious.",1396777293.0

He then looks over at me and pulls a gun and says give me all your money i open my wallet and hand him all my money $65. He then tells me to get out of his yard or he will kill me. So now im at my house thanking god he didnt hurt me but mad that i just lost $65 and still dope sick with no money. its 3am and im pissed. 

So my question is whats the most you've ever been robbed for? Im just trying to make myself feel better knowing im not the first person this has happened to and probably not the most money anybody has ever got stolen from.

He even offered to break me off right up front. Wow, that's very generous thank you bro. He gets here and I call my boy, we meet and I get in the car and it turns out, he's with HIS dealer so the money is going to a dealer I'm not familiar with. It's all the same shit, though so no worries. I watch it weigh on the scale to 3.7. He was supposed to get a ball (3.5) so I was amped for him to be able to get such a nice deal, so quickly. I give him the shit, he breaks me off yada yada yada.


Here's my problem. Fellow redditor texts me a bit later and says he just weighed it out, and low and fucking behold it weighs 2.1. OH HELL FUCKING NO. That dealer has made me look bad, and it has cost a friend money. That is NOT okay. I go back a while with the guy who's dealer we used. I hit him up and after much loosening up, he says yeah whenever your boy comes down we can make it right with 1.6. Problem is I don't want to tell him to come through and then dealer bails on me. Then I look like the bad guy. I'm contemplating just buying the lost amount myself, and giving it to him. Thoughts?


This is really eating up at me. He trusted me, someone he's never met to do right by him. I DID. But because someone needed to maximize their fucking profits or some bullshit, he got shorted.

22faiy,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/22faiy/what_should_i_do_part_two/,13,https://redd.it/22faiy,DeceptiveBeast,What should I do? (Part two),"Well... against everyone's advice and helpful responses, last night I scored .5 of some ECP and had 2mg worth of benzos. Maybe some you saw the post or not, sorry I can link but I'm on mobile. 

Some back story first to make sense of my situation. Sorry in advanve if its a dense wall of text. This is a little deeper.

I have been with this girl on/off for the past five years with us being ""on"" for almost 3 years now. Within the first 3 months of us being back together we found out we were expecting a child. I know it was just plain horrible of me but I was in the process of leaving the church and still had lingering abortion issues (to which have completely changed). So come to find out slightly later, she cheated on me with one of my now ex-friends but swears they used protection. Besides that, I stick by her through the whole pregnancy, moving into our own place together with me getting a plumbing apprenticeship to support ourselves during this time. The due date comes and I kind of secretly wish I could've seen a black head pop out (I'm white) to absolve myself. But alas a beautiful Caucasian baby girl emerges and I instantly fall in love with my gorgeous daughter.

Things go as good as they can be for awhile until I get laid off in December of '12. I try to find employment while my SO gets a min wage job while I collect unemployment to get by. Things start to get rocky but no more than two young parents (19/18) on their own can be. 

Fast forward to Nov. '13, my unemployment runs out and SO quit her job months ago because ""working only on Sat. And Sundays was too demanding""... so we move to my SO parents house (which is disgusting) and we give my father temp. Guardianship of our daughter to give her some stability until we get on our feet.

Note: we started dabbling in dope (just railing, only railing) to keep our sanity at first a few months after our daughter was born. (Also formula fed, never breast)

So for the most part its been kept to chipping a couple days a week while we had custody and never at the same time as the other so she was never neglected.

Fast forward again to today. Our arguments have escalated dramatically along with our dope usage(still just insufflated) over the past few months. I am a very passive person so it is mostly one sided arguments and could even say violent mental abuse towards me. Literally any little thing will set her off(eg. Calling me stupid, dumb, idiot, loser, horrible parent, cussed at ect...) for little things like forgetting to take my shoes off, trash out, cup in the sink ect...(I have diagnosed ADD without any meds). It used to be when she was PMSing or on dope, but now its 24/7 mood swings. 

I also have very low self esteem and clinically depressed diagnosed before any drug use. Here lately, it has been really testing my mental state and I know I wouldn't be with her if it wasn't for the child we share. My family has been warning me from the start that she isn't good for me but I keep seeing the good in her and been blind to what they try and tell me. But I have finally seen the truth for once, and realize that she isn't just abusive, but that she is a habitual liar. Up until recently I have believed everything she said because I haven't had any reason not to believe what she says. Everything makes sense and is perfectly logical as far as everything goes. But recently I have been catching her in lies that DO NOT EVEN BENEFIT HER IN ANY WAY. So of course its making wonder what else she is lying about. I mean everyday little things she will lie about with no intention with no regret or remorse. And the worst part about it is that my dman was the one who opened my eyes completely because he's my man and immediately notifies me anytime something shady comes out of her mouth to his girl. 

So recently I have almost no trust in anything she says which is making it harder to find anything good in this relationship. She constantly threatens to throw me out or have her parents do it over those petty faus pas' I listed earlier. And recently I will admit to arguing back and get out ta hand sometimes but honestly only after she lays it on me for something completely dumb and stupid. Every time I go to pack my shit, the tears come out and ask when I'm going to unpack my stuff and I fall for it every time. Even when this happens she still makes it seem like I'm the most privileged person in the world to live in this dump and then continues to threaten to kick me out like I have nowhere to go while both me parents (separated) plead for me to just come back home (which I would prefer).

And on a different note, yes, we are both unemployed, and both addicted to dope and cigarettes. So we share 50/50 all our substances. For the most part I don't complain, but I come up with all of these things myself, either hustling or through my family with no help whatsoever from her at all. She has some complex that she's entitled to 50% of what I get going as far as to split the pack of cigarettes in half and refusing to bum me ONE OF MY OWN JACKS if I run out before her. But if she somehow comes across her own pack cigarettes, they're all hers, and I have to beg for at least one if I have none.

In conclusion if I haven't lost you yet (I'm so sorry) we stayed up all night last night, and last night (if you read my previous post) I went ahead and popped my 2mg of benzos because she was already driving me crazy. And I continued to split my .5 of ecp with her. This morning I wanted to smoke a cigarette ~6am which for some reason really set her off for some reason and it literally was like the straw breaking the camels back. I did the last .1 I was supposed to share and sent her on a wild goose chase for the non existent .05.

This is sort of a rant but I do want some opinions on what I should do now. I haven't wanted to move back home so bad in my life but I don't know how to go about it especially in this situation. I'm only 21 and I feel completely stuck.

I don't want to be on opiates for the rest of my life. I'm not saying I want to rush through it, I'm just stating that this is my long-term goal. I think it's important to know this as this will affect what route i want to take.

With that said, I've been on 100mL of methadone for a year now. I still use. I fluctuate between a half point to a point a day (of H). I have a hard time stopping the H.

I was on suboxone a few years earlier and it really helped me to stop using. I would relapse once a month; I was going down steadily. I felt like that treatment actually helped me, which is what I don't feel from methadone.

So the question I have is: Would the following be a good plan of action, and what would you recommend I do to get to my goal?

I want to go down on my methadone until I get to 30-40ml (or whatever it takes) to make the switch to suboxone while maintaining my H use if I can't lower it. I really can't say that methadone has done much to help me quit. I'm going to bring up this plan with my doctor at my next appointment.

Another idea I had a while back that my doctor didn't agree with (mostly because no one had tried this before, and he was worried it would fuck up my progress) was that I detox off methadone for two weeks (enough time to get it out of my system) while substituting it with H during that time (to keep from getting too sick). then i would make the switch to suboxone. I'm wondering if anyone has ever tried this and how did it go?

TL; DR I'm basically just looking for advice because I don't think MMT is working for me towards my long-term goal. I just don't know what to do about it i the safest way possible. If you have other suggestions, I'm open to hearing them.",1396850001.0

Might be a dumb question but just wanted to check my experience here wasn't unusual!

Does anyone else find that the blood in the barrel when registering can differ depending where they are?

For example, there's a vein in my elbow crook - not the biggest fat one, but one just next to it, nearer the outside of my arm. (So if my left palm is facing up, this vein I'm on about is to the left of the big crook vein.) it points straight up my arm (on my right it angles to the right a bit) and I can only really hit it with a fully straightened arm and a tourniquet.

Anyway, the register from that vein on both sides is a full on plume, a thin jet that eagerly shoots up, turning into a palm tree shape at the top. It's almost black.

Elsewhere, however, the blood trickles in a little less eagerly, and is made of a stream of red droplets. I know I'm not hitting arteries or anything cause I'm still alive! Sometimes, if I'm trying again with a mixture I already messed up with, so it's dark with blood, I can see this red bright against the dark mixture (god knows how you see anything with tar over there in the US!).

That's one question. Another one is this. There are times when I definitely register, but it hurts like I'm missing when I shoot. If I am sick and think 'fuck it', I will miss even though I repeatedly register throughout the shot- meaning I haven't slipped out.

HOWEVER- this only happens if I'm shooting in an area where I've recently missed, or used the vein a lot, or it's a bit swollen/worse for wear. So I kind of imagine that it might be registering, but the vein is leaking through other holes, hence the miss. Has anyone else experienced this? It's infuriating when you register, feel that joy, then start pressing and it stings like a motherfucker! It also means you've filled your shot with blood and have to dilute.

Clearly the answer is 'if you've messed up an area of vein, move on, little one' but I'd still be interested to see if anyone else still feels wary, even if they see blood, until they've actually started pushing down. It's also a bit confused by the fact that certain veins can hurt a bit- sometimes ones that are fresh. For example, I once thought I'd ripped a foot vein in two, it hurt so bad- and all was good a couple minutes ago.

I just find this interesting because the textbook advice on shooting is 'if you see blood in the syringe when you pull back, inject slowly'. This doesn't help with the experience above- it also caused my first ever shot to miss, because one little droplet of blood - possibly the 'flash' as I punctured the vein, convinced me all was good. Bang, OW- I remember thinking 'if that's what it feels like I don't think I will do that again!'

Now look where I am...;)

i've been visiting to this subreddit for quite some time now, but i've never posted anything or interacted with any of you lovely suscribers. this whole community seems like a great support group and a great reference for any questions I might have. so just a little bit about myself, 

i've been an opiate user for a few years now. only recently have I switched from taking pills / smoking dope to actually slamming, i'm still getting the hang of it as far as finding a vein (it's hard!!) i've found that my cravings are much more manageable in this fashion, as well as just an overall feeling much cleaner and calmer than when I'm smoking everyday. but oh man, hitting a vein is still such a challenge... routinely I get frustrated and just end up IMing it - this is much easier but I've found the high just isn't quite the same.  would anyone have any advice surrounding the transition from IM to IV? I don't want to IM too much as I've heard that it isn't good to keep doing it - is this true?

Anyways, that's all I have for now. Thanks for any advice / stories pertaining to my little rant, and I'm looking forward to chatting more with everyone in the future. good vibes from applesauceem..",1396951395.0

So here it goes..

I have been using pills over the course of about 7 or 8 years - managed to keep it under control until a year ago when I met a steady connect (chick I worked withs BF) Me and her became good friends, was buying from him nearly daily and all was well. Besides the typical DD time, waiting hours for a no, etc all was good. 

So fast forward to today - I've been using everyday now for the past month - mainly just a handful of Vic 10s to help keep the withdraws away but yesterday of course I ran out.. Come upon some cash today (WOO HOO!) So hit me homegirl up who I used to work with as she said she knew a few people. So I proceed to travel a good 20miles to meet her - we chill while were waiting for her BF to decide if it's worth it or not (smh) then finally after 2 and a half hours of waiting - he comes through. I give her the cash (since she has never ever fucked me over and we're as close as two addicts can be) and tell her I have to run into a store to get a car charger as my shitty iphone is now dead. Cool, no problem.

Well, I walk outside after sitting in line for a good 20min and her car is now gone. I immediately think, fuck.. She fucking ran off withy last bit of cash or took my pills and jetted. I run to my car to charge my phone to see a note on my drivers seat ""guy had to run, they're wet but they are 224s - text me later! &amp;lt;3"" with a little napkin with the joints in them - praise hallelujah!!! I didn't get fucked.

So wrong I was.. I open up the tissue with the pills and at first glance, they look like 224s, taste like 224s but the impressions on the pill have been rubbed out so no way to identify. I try to give them the benefit on the doubt, but I still text her saying ""Heyy man, these are pretty sketch looking - sure they're legit?"" To which she replies, of course! I did one! They're good! 

So awesome.. I eat one and go on my merry way. Now my tolerance has been relatively low lately, I normally feel a 30, at least a little - normally about 15 minutes after eating one I can feel a swoop in my belly and BAM LOVELY AURAAA but nah - zilch - FUCKING NOTHING! 

At that point I assume that maybe my tolerance has gone up so I pop another and by the time that kicks in - I'm home. So I hop out of my car and it feels like I just drank 10 shots and just stood up - I'm dizzy as a tick..and something isn't right. I know what oxy feels like, I know how it hits me.

So I walk in the house and try to look at the pills closer and aesthetically they look similar to 224s but I can't make out the markings - meanwhile, my equilibrium is fucking SHOT. Suddenly I can't walk, can't stand up, nothing and my pupils are GINORMOUS! (Like horror movie, down the stairs ginormous) 

Then someone in the house asks if I'm okay - I respond yes I'm fine, just need to lay down. I make it to my bed and fucking crash - I don't remember falling asleep or too much but I woke up with the phone in my hand and half writing a text to homegirl.

After waking up, I fucking flip my lid - I know that Heyy, I'm buying fucking drugs and this shit happens but me and this couple have a history - I have helped them out on many occasions when sick or if they need to run errands, baby formula, joints I have bought for both of them when they're W/Ding hardcore because I'm just that type of person who hates seeing someone suffer if I can help. 

I text the dude telling him how fucked up this is - idk what the pills were but they can NOT be oxy and that we need to get this figured out - that was my last bit of cash for fucks sake! He doesn't respond.

She sends me sort of sympathetic texts back - she's sorry, they worked fine for her, she doesn't understand, etc.

So here I sit, no money, no connects and on day two of a horrifying withdraw. I was bawling my eyes out earlier because I'm a pussy - all bullshit aside I'm a good person who tries to help people when I can and I don't expect shit back but a little respect when shit goes wrong. 

So I guess I have to chunk it up as a loss and get on with my fucking life. I'm thinking this is the straw that broke the camels back as I plan on calling a suboxone treatment center tomorrow and throwing in the towel for awhile. I can't deal with this shit anymore. It's killing my goddamn soul.

Sorry for the fucking WALL of text but I had to get it out. If you made it this far, thank you.

Side note - does anyone know what these pills might be from my vague description? They're very similar to 224s but slightly thinner and the effects were as if I was shit faced drunk and passed out. Idk if there's anything I can really do to test them (still have two and am scared to fuck with them now) but any advice will help. Can post a pic if necessary.

Need some Answers/Advice.,"Ive decided that I need to get off the junk. I shoot dope because I'm terribly depressed with no direction in life. I have ZERO friends, no girlfriend, dropped out of college because I don't know what the fuck I'm doing with my life. My days consist of sleeping, playing COD, watching movies and doing dope. The only way I get my shit is through the darknet, on Silk Road. I deliver pizza part time to support my habit.

Two days ago my parents found one of my needles. I couldn't face them. Yet instead of deciding to check myself into rehab I packed my shit and walked to a nearby Motel, where Ive been staying for the past few days. Ive got half a gram left and I Plan to finish it before going home and checking into rehab. 

Ive been doing heroin for about 4 months now. Snorting for three months, and I started shooting about 3 weeks ago. My question is how bad is this going to be? Ive never really withdrawn before, but Ive been deep enough into them to know what its like, and I'm terrified. Also I have a relativley small tolerance, a gram of BTH will last me a week. 

My other question is, when I get to rehab, will they give me any comfort drugs like benzo's or even some subs to help me sleep? Or will they tell me no, its Cold turkey. 

I know im coming off as a pussy right now, but that who I am. a big pussy. I know theres junkies who get clean after ten years of shooting. How the fuck do they do it? I go for 16 hours without some dope and I start loosing my mind.

But anyways he was hooking us up and we didn't really know anyone else so we were sort of stuck. Fast forward a couple weeks, we've been getting off him almost every day and a lot every day. He keeps saying he can get oxy's but his connect always falls through. Then finally it seems we have a deal after being given the run around all day. Show up to the spot things get a little fishy...he goes in to get the stuff comes out and hands us a bag of tylenol or some shit pulls a gun out and robs us of the 400 we were about to throw down. So now not only are we out 400 dollars but also our one and only connect here. We're out of everything and feeling super sick physically and I'm sick to my stomach over what happened.

And I have only been using hydros and couple percs for last 2 weeks so my tolerance has dropped a bit and I should have had a huge rush. But within a couple of minutes I was really high. And it was also a really clean high. So 15 mins later at next stop I drove him to I did another shot of about a point and again very little rush. I then went to my car to smoke a Marlboro black, my new favorite cigs, & wow I was so high I had blurry vision bad. And was nodding hard. Tgis stuff has hella legs as well. Im still pretty high and intitial launch time was 7 hours ago. Just kind of unusual because I have done a lot of tar but never had such a strong high off of tar with no intitial rush. And I know this stuff wasn't cut with fent. So anyone else have similar experience lately?  My D boy said the exact same thing as me and he can't go more than 4 to 5 hours without a dose before he starts to ill. Anyway happy nods bropiates.",1397033003.0

It's a gentle but slightly uncomfortable sensation. This feeling moves down from my head to my toes. First, I feel my head get heavy, then my shoulders, back, and then the rest of my body.

I got clean for about a year and I dealt with a lot of really horrible depression during that time. I've been back using for another year or so and the hallucinations have been happening a lot lately (I'm 25).  I'll shoot up and I'll start to think someone is in my house, it's like I can feel someone else in my house and hear them.  I'll sit on my couch and hear voices.  I'll sit and have full blown conversations with myself and these voices for hours.  Lately, what's really bothering me is that I've been seeing things.  Nothing menacing, but weird stuff like I'll think a car drives by, or someone is standing outside my car, or that things aren't what they really are (last night I though a baggie was a turtle on my dashboard and asked my passenger where it came from).  It's weird, I'll have a moment of clarity and ""catch myself"" but it still feels like a reality.  I' feel like when I'm not high I'm really sick, so that kind of distracts me from anything that I might hear or see.

Now don't get me wrong here, he is a great dude, one of the nicest people i've ever met, and he's had a real tough life. But now his addiction is causing him to do all this shit.

22p972,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/22p972/new_absolute_bottom/,13,https://redd.it/22p972,thrwyJunkie941,New Absolute Bottom," I guess I'll just start chronologically backwards from last night (technically this morning) at 2 AM when I was released from the local county jail. My buddy posted bond for me to the tune of $200. The charges were possession of a controlled substance (4x 4mg dilaudid) and possession or use of narcotics equipment.  

Needless to say, having been arrested around six PM the previous day, I was going through the initial stages of pretty intense withdrawal. Runny nose. Teary eyes. All-over pain. Coughing. Nausea. I walked to the nearby 7-Eleven, got the cash off my money card they turn your cash into and called a cab home. I was able to get a pretty decent hit of morphine from the collected washes of thirty or so pills (30 mg instant release, in case you were wondering) so I got 8 ml of filtered wash and I boiled that down to fit in an insulin syringe. I instantly felt better and even got the morphine tinglys I really only feel if I bang over 45 mg.  

Anyway, I crash out around five only to wake up at seven thirty in order to call my mom on the other coast before she has to go to work and emotionally blackmail her into sending me the $250 it's going to take to get my car out of impound. It ends up the reason I got pulled over was that my license was suspended from not paying a ticket. The money for the ticket went in my vein instead.   

As did most of my last (as in final, not latest) paycheck from my evening dishwashing career. I was making ten bucks an hour there and apparently the greedy new owner decided that it was a bit much to be paying so she fired me to hire someone new at 8/hr. I can't fault her from a business point of view but it does fuck me over pretty hard cause I was making 500 every two weeks there. My morning job paid 300 every two weeks until I got fired Sunday because my phone (which I use as an alarm) shut down and didn't turn itself back on that previous Friday. When I called in, I was told to stay home because someone else was on their way.  

On top of all this, I'm maintaing a very expensive pill habit because I'm physically dependent. My girl left me to ""get clean"" avoiding me because I'm a ""trigger"" resulting in my becoming more depressed than usual. Especially after finding out through mutual friends that she is still using. She probably just doesn't want to pay me the two hundred bucks she owes me and throwing away the two years (off and on) that we've had together is what she has to do. I don't know, though. It's hard to be sure about anything when someone (Jane, not me) has Borderline Personality Disorder along with PTSD, ADHD, sociopathic tendencies, an eating disorder,and self-harm issues. I hate that I love her and that I feel so connected to her -like we're both different shards of the same shattered soul. The night before she ceased contact was one of the most emotionally-intense nights of bonding we had ever shared.  

And we've had years together of finishing each other's sentences, laughing at the same fucked-up shit, helping each other get high or just get well that it hurts me so much when it doesn't phase her in the least to just sever our bond. I guess it says a lot about me that I can bond with a girl so fucking damaged she's like an emotional holocaust.  

The worst thing about all this is that I'm already on probation for possession of pot. So this is going to be another violation and the last one was 500 bucks to bond out of. So it looks like I'm going to get to detox in jail until my court date. I'm so sick of this shit and the only thing that's a temporary reprieve is the reason I'm in all this shit in the first place.  

I don't know why I wrote this, just that it feels a tiny bit better now that I have. The dilaudid I'm about to shoot up isn't going to hurt my lifted mood either.

4. When you inhale through a foil pipe always exhale out of the pipe also.

5. Once you have smoked all your gear open up the foil pipe and see that you have product that is better than the first time you smoked it!

I'd never experienced that feeling of normalcy before, I vividly remember thinking 'Is this what it's like for normal people?'",1397110121.0

Told his mother that his friends pressured him into using to make it seem not so bad. His mom his now going around and telling our moms that we are bad influences that caused her sons problems.,"Alright fellow opiates, I was wondering if any of you guys have gone through this. My friend got arrested about a month ago for possession of heroin. After this he moved back home and went to rehab and told his mom everything of his past use. He basically mentioned everyone that he used with and said that we basically turned him onto it or peer pressured him into using to make it seems like it was not 100% his fault for his fuck up. So his mom basically went bat shit and his now calling all our parents saying how we are bad influences and drug users and that we basically are responsible for her sons fuck up. 

Now I can understand if we were all teenagers but we are all in our mid 20's. Some of us are out on our own and some of us still live and home. They way I see it is that we are all grown adults in this situation and that we should take responsibility of our actions. Now we have some bat shit mom going around calling all our parents saying we are responsible for her sons habit. 

How would one deal with this. ",1397109001.0

So today was a unique sort of day.  Karma sure was looking out!!  Let me start from the beginning.  I have one main dboy I've been going to for almost a year.  Never wronged me, nice guy, yada yada yada.  So yesterday, he burned a friend of mine for a hundred bucks.  Didn't sound like him, but it happened.  This morning I came to him, (with a fellow redditor) for a small order of $40 for 5 or 6 bags.  5 minutes away I called and all was good, he said he would meet me in front of his house as per usual.  I arrive with fellow redditor, (we will call him R), and his girl.  Dboy don't show.  10 minutes go by... 20 minutes... 30 minutes... nothing.  I walk up to his apartment and knock on the door.  No reply.  Fuck it.  I decided to cold cop on the main strip.  

I talked to a nice Spanish man with a friendly smile and asked if he could help a couple of sick kids here.  He introduced himself as ""Rome"" and said, ""sure baby, I only got four on me though."" which was perfect because we had $40 between the two of us.  Stamps were pretty good, good enough to come back for sure.  I gave him my number, and he assured me that he would call when he refilled his minutes on his phone.  

Later on in the day, I went back to the city.  Walking around, looking for another connect to go to until I heard from Rome.  As I walked down the street, I got a call from Rome.  ""Where can I meet you?"" I walked to the place he told me to meet.  

He spent most of the day with me, driving around to cop, and just hang out.  He seems generally trustworthy.  I informed the friend of mine who got burned by the old dboy, that I have this new connect, a little cheaper than the old one, better quality, and bigger bags.  He was ecstatic at the news because he sells the bags that he gets for cheap.  I took him up and he copped a bun and change.  Gave me 2 bags for the favor.  

General consensus is that these stamps are good, and the price is right.  Rome just called me telling me how he can't believe how perfectly this worked out today.  Truthfully, I can't either.

(And some questions),"I've lurked this sub for awhile, but never posted from my main account because I know people there who don't need to know I use. I wanted to be able to post though, because this sub has helped me a lot in different ways.

I guess what little I can say about myself: I'm a upper-middle class female. Went to good schools, was raised by a former-military man turned cop. Never so much as smoked weed until my last year of college. I work in education. I was introduced first to dilaudid by a friend and the original intent was that we'd stick just to pills. Fast forward a week or two and our dealer doesn't have pills but she does have h. My friend has struggled a few years ago with opiate addiction, bigtime, but he promised he knew enough about it to keep me safe if it was something I wanted to try. I said ""eh, fuck it, let's do it."" My only rule was no needles. He agreed, and for months we've been smoking. Last week he shot up for the first time, but I haven't given in. 

As far as use, I use probably once every week or every other week. Sometimes I do dilaudid and we've sought out roxy from our dealer, but generally we do h. He's often made the comment that when we're driving home with it ""You can afford to be less careful, no cop would ever suspect you of drugs"".

Anyway, I guess that's as much as I can think of about myself and why I finally gave in and made an account. I guess I also had some questions:

1) Honestly, no bullshit: is it true that once you start shooting it you're done for? I've not been tempted to try it, I just know my friend might be playing with fire by switching back to that.

2) What's your favorite opiate? How do the ones you've done stack up against each other? When we did dilaudid I hated it because I didn't feel like I was getting a good enough high off it. When I smoke heroin we split it (with even a pinch off for his roommate) and I still get a good high off it.

This include oxycodone, morphine, opana, etc. but less commonly fentanyl, nucynta, and kadian.  brand pain medications are rare to find except in wealthy areas where patients demand brand everything or if something is not available in generic form. 

When you call to ask about what a pharmacy has in stock of a controlled substances, 9/10 you will be told they don't carry it or don't have it in stock at the moment (unless they know you).  If they don't have it in stock, they can order whatever it is (unless it's unavailable from the wholesaler or manufacturer) in 2 days (though some places only put in cII orders periodically--once a week to once a month) or 4 days if it's a weekend.  

Therefore, when you have someone tell you ""I'm sorry I can't/won't fill that for you"", they are trying to be honest with you and treat you with respect as a person.  The law, at least in my state, says very specifically, if a pharmacist knows or SHOULD HAVE KNOWN that a prescription is not legitimate, may be abused, is not for a legitimate purpose, is written without a proper doctor-patient relationship, is likely to be misused or diverted, etc., they are held legally liable for dispensing that medication and can be prosecuted as a drug dealer.  

Pharmacists are very fearful of being prosecuted or losing their licenses as most graduate with 100-200k in loans.  This does often result in untreated pain and pharmacists and doctors turning away legitimate pain patients.  

In addition, if a pharmacist or pharmacy orders too much of a specific controlled substance ingredient (amphetamine, oxycodone, etc.), they will be cut off from ordering any more of that substance for a period of time.  This is extremely bad to a pharmacy if they have a legitimate patient that gets that prescription regularly and they can no longer supply that patient.  Therefore, some pharmacists may only accept prescriptions from someone they already have a patient-provider relationship with so they don't run over-order a medication they know someone needs and get cut off.  

tl;dr:  Someone telling you they won't fill a prescription for you respects you more than someone telling you they don't have it.  ",1397075577.0

Cocaine vs withdrawals.","So this is **not** /u/sleepylittlemouse. I posted a thing for her before, which is why I still have this throwaway left (my main account would, unfortunately, be too discredited if it was found posting here. Yeah, I know, I'm a pussy).

Anyhow - I've been doing IV dope for about year and a half now. It's gotten to the half-a-gram per day point, which was obviously unsustainable at IL prices. Since late February, circumstances have forced me to take a deep cut, and move to 0.1-2 per day, every other day or so (obviously with huge withdrawals during that ""off"" day). I didn't want to keep living like that, it was hardly a life, when more than half of it was spent suffering, and a quarter more - sleeping.

So recently I've come into a little bit of money, and have, uncharacteristically, not immediately blown it on dope, but rather decided to pick one of my dealers up on an offer of selling coke, and... **OH MY GOD**. All the withdrawal symptoms are gone. The ""hydrophobia"" (I don't know what else to call it - inability to drink sufficient amounts of liquids) - is history. I actually feel euphoria again, all from an amount of coke that would barely pause the withdrawal had it been dope... Hell, doing that first shot, I thought I was just testing waters (I've obviously done coke before - but only snorted), yet I felt like I was near an overdose. Tolerance (or lack thereof) is no joke.

So, after telling you my story - please poke holes in my brilliant plan of just getting through the withdrawal on this gram. Amount-wise - it's more than enough. I know about tolerance, but it doesn't develop this quickly. The maint thing I'm worried about is sleep - if I ""sober up"" from coke, I will feel too shitty to sleep, If I am on coke - sleep is obviously not an option. That's a difficult one, but, judging by my past withdrawals - I can't sleep anyway... Any other problems? Will the withdrawals hit pause or some shit?

EDIT: Well, it was mostly working, masking the symptoms and all, but IV coke cravings return after 30-45 minutes after a shot... That's not very sustainable. After running out of the gram, I got a bag of dope and did a shot to avoid crashing down to stim/dope withdrawal. I'm not sure what to do next...",1397208027.0

I've got a good technique going at the moment with 8mg codeine and 500mg acetaminophen tablets; paper towels; and tumblers. But i was looking at the price of chemistry glassware and was surprised. For £15 i could get all the stuff i need.

I want to do a vacuum filtration with a buchner flask. I ~~think~~ hope it would offer a better filter time and a better extraction than just letting gravity do the trick. The whole mixture could be filtered instead of decanting and leaving the sludge because it clogs the filter.

My plan is

* crush 32 pills and add to beaker

* add ~100ml of cold water

* mix well

* put it in the freezer to precipitate out any APAP

* stir it back up

* pour into the filter and start the vacuum

* collect the liquid in the flask and serve

I've been around for a while on here, wouldn't say I'm new to the sub, but new to contributing.  Anyways, read a post here on the car eating a pill, and laughed my ass off.  About 2 months ago, I grabbed emptied out my pockets before I got into my car and had 10 or so perks in my pocket, threw them in the change ""drawer"" beside the steering wheel and closed the flap, hour or so later I open it up, grab a few out, and hit the flap with my knee on the way out, essentially catapulting the perks up inside the dashboard.  I was able to get all but 3 out.  3 perks never to be seen again.  The absolute worst part about it was that when I'd be on scripts for a few hours/days, and be driving to work or out and about, I could hear those little fuckers rattling around in the dash!  Such complete bullshit it was to be hurting, know they're in there, but not be able to get at them.  Fast forward to today,  completed the sale of the car, lengthy process, guy test drove it, his mechanic drove it, no problems.  I was praying that he wouldn't notice the rattling, which seemed to come and go, certainly noticable when hitting a bump or an abrupt turn.  Nothing was said about it and I was relieved.  3 hours after the sale's completed, I get a call from the guy ""Hey bud, everythings great but there's this fucking rattling noise coming from the front that's driving me nuts""  Couldn't help but smile.

I guess my question is—what do I really have? My doctor is really paranoid about the klonopin due to the possibility of abuse. I'm assuming .5 mg is a low dose, what do people take to get high? I have a lot of vic, 10mg is starting to affect me less. What's a safe increase?

Well I got some very discouraging news yesterday so I'm just going to tell me story involving opiates.

Like a lot of people the story about my heroin usage does not actually begin with heroin, but with pills. Now I had done pills before off and on for a couple years after a car wreck and I first got prescribed a decent amount. I had 10mg vicodines, about 30 of them, and I ate a few at a time to test the waters. After that I consider myself hooked. I blew through that script in about a week and once it was gone I was out hunting for more. I never had a steady supply or hookup, so I never got sick or anything when I ran out. I had a friend who I will refer to as Jeremy.

Jeremy introduced me to all sort of different drugs and our favorite thing was psycahdelics. This was all fine and dandy for about a year until one day I let him borrow my motorcycle. He had just left work on my bike, and me in his car. We were really close so doing something like this did not seem like a bad idea. Obviously I was completely wrong about that. As I am driving home I get a call from his wife about 10 minutes after I saw him and she is screaming at me and freaking out. ""I told you not to let him borrow your bike, how fucking stupid can you be!"". Screaming shit like that over and over,""C, you need to shut the fuck up and tell me what happened instead of yelling."" After a minute or so of calming her down she tells me Jeremy has wrecked my bike and is really hurt and they are on their way to the hospital. This was my best friend so I immediately do a u-turn and head to the hospital. I get there about a minute after they did and their is blood all over their car, not a little blood but a huge amount, more than I have ever seen in my life. This feels me with what I can only describe as despair, the sinking feeling in my gut that I inadvertently killed my friend by letting him use my bike. I rush into the emergency room and they are wheeling him into the back. He is screaming in pain and as I get closer I can see why. Right about his knee cap is a massive hole, you can see him bone clear as day, his pants are red from the blood. This scared me more than anything. My friend, covered in tattoos, massively muscular and intimidating, is sitting there screaming and crying from pain. Later on we figured out it was the foot peg on the bike that dug into his leg and ripped more of his knee out. 

I came back the next day after his initial surgery and he has 72 staples on his knee area, and it looked like something out of a horror movie. I sat over there almost everyday after work, being there for the screaming and crying during physical therapy, helping him get whatever he needs. He was in the hospital for about a month or so, and he had surgeries a couple times after the initial trip to the hospital.
As you can imagine they loaded him down with painkillers, vast amounts of them. This is where is really start to go down hill. I'm there every day buying as many pills as I can get my hands on. Vicodines, percs, oxys and roxys and whatever you can think of. If they made it, he got a script for it at least once. This cycle drug on for months, getting paid, going to Jeremy's, loaded on pills, out of pills, sick, pay check, pills, on and on. At this I had a lot going on in my personal life between my and my family, and the people I had chosen to surround myself with.

I left town and lived at the beach for about a year, just grabbed everything I could, threw it in my car and left the same day. In short I had almost gotten my life together completely during this time period. Once I felt I had accomplished what I needed to at the beach I head back to my hometown. Guess who the first person that call me when I get back is? Jeremy. Now at this point Jeremy has all his pills and has also begun experimenting with heroin. He looks fragile compared to how he used to. This man I considered my best friend had changed into a different person, a man driven by his need to ingest these narcotics all day every day.

I get my old job back and he has somehow maintained his employment there as well, and that was all it took to get me to try heroin. The price point compared to pills I could not turn down. I sniffed heroin and pills like I sniffed the air around me. Him and his wife begun shooting up at some point during this period, I cannot recall exactly when, but I would never put a need in my arm. I never did until tragedy struck me and my family.

3 months of being back in town and starting this cycle all over again I am at home in my apartment and get a call from the police department. The cops want to come to my place and talk to me about my brother. As I'm sitting there drinking with some girl the cops arrive and I stand in the hallway and speak with him. They found my brother in a hotel room about a mile down the road. He was dead in the recliner with the hotel door wide open. I was the only member of my family in town, so I had to call my parents and tell them to come back to town, tell them their son was dead, and my brother was gone. I sat in the hospital by myself for about an hour by myself until some of my family arrives. It was over 4 hours before my parents arrived from out of town. Once they got there I left and walked down the street to the bar, and took about 10 shots of bacardi 151. I got back to the hotel and the next morning I wake up on the floor of my apartment. 

That was the most difficult night of my life. The phone call to my parents might have been the worse part of it all aside from the actual death of my brother. All I could manage to choke out was ""you need to come home, Matthew is dead"". After I said those words I don't know what I said, I just broke down even harder over the phone, hearing my mother lose it and my father try to reserve himself in front of her. 
The funeral was about a week later, and I was to upset to drive. Well Jeremy and his wife were friends with my brother as well and said they would pick me up on the way. When they arrive they bust out a baggie and a needle. I put up resistance for all of 1 or 2 minutes before I gave in. I just didn't give a fuck anymore, about myself, or any of those around me. The rush I felt, the immediate lack of pain, the euphoria. I had to sit down. I thought to myself, this is the greatest thing I have ever come across. After the initial rush we hopped into the car and went to the funeral. Once I saw the casket the feeling was gone and all I felt was emptiness. Endless emptiness. In retrospect that was the shittiest thing I had ever done, shoot dope before his funeral. This feeling just drove my empty feeling further.

After the funeral I bought a small amount and a clean needle off of them. The next months are a blur for the most part, an endless cycle of driving a town over, buying dope, coming home and shooting it. Eventually I didn't even wait to get home and just shot up in the car or at gas station bathrooms and the like.

One day I was feeling particularly shitty. Sick, missing my brother, depression. I had drank and beer and popped a klonopin or two(?) a hour or two before I drove to Jeremy's where I loaded up. I sat on the couch and let that feeling sink in. I am dreaming, floating through space, calm and peaceful. In reality I was as close to dead as you can be. I was in this head space and I just got ripped out of it. I am lying on the floor, puking like I had never puked before. I could make out paramedics around me, and my ""friends"" off to the side looking at me. I am wheeled to the ambulance, black in and out. I later learned they use two shots of naxolone, and one shot of adrenaline to bring me out of it. The only clear picture I have of that night was my father sitting in the chair next to me at the hospital. ""I'm not going to lose another child to this fucking shit."" His face, what he said and the way he said it, I will never forget it.
 
I stayed in the hospital for a few days to make sure detox was completely done, and never put dope in my veins again.
Jeremy on the other hand just got worse and worse, but he lost his job so he moved to Texas where he had some family. This only worsened his problem due to the availability of BTH down there. The first time I talked to him after he moved that all he could talk about was how good the dope was down there. We eventually had a falling out and stopped speaking, then started talking again and then fell out again. The dope had strangled his life, and his mind was breaking under it.

Now on to the terrible news I spoke of at first. Jeremy was headed my to my home state. He wanted help from me but there was nothing I could do. I had talked to a mutual friend a few days earlier. Jeremy robbed him after he tried to hang himself in our friends backyard. He had to go out there and cut him down. When he arrived in NC they arrested him soon as he stepped off the greyhound and sent him back to Texas to face other various charges. I spoke with his mother yesterday to see what he was sent back for exactly. The drug charges and theft didn't surprise me, what did, and what shook me to my core was his other charges involving their oldest child. She is currently 11. He and his wife were taking pornagraphic pictures of her and making money off the pictures to support their dope habit. This eventually led them to molesting her themselves, if not worse, I couldn't bear to know any more than that. I took care of their children for years, even before the drugs ever became involved. In my eyes they are my own children, and I thought about them every day. Now they are in jail, and the kids are lost to me some where in the system. If I could find them I wouldn't hesitate to adopt them in a heartbeat. Me and my fiance are looking into options to do this but I don't think it can become a reality. I miss those kids and I love them dearly but I have no idea where they are now.

""When the dope runs dry""


Your stomach's all in knots and you're freezing with the chills, 

So you throw on some blankets, now you're sweating to the gills... 

Now you're throwin up your dinner, both your burger and your fries, 

When the dope runs dry



Kicking and screaming you know you'll never get to sleep, 

So you search through your carpet, on your knees like a creep... 

Now you're smoking bowls of resin, you'll do anything to get high, 

When the dope runs dry



You're so bored you're going crazy, but you can't get out of bed, 

Except to shit out diarrhea 'til your asshole's nice and red... 

Now you're holding a revolver asking, ""what's the point of life!?""

Two things that don't often mix well, with the former typically yanking you out of the latter by the veins in your arms. Sure, you can live in both worlds at once, for a little while at least. Until you need more to get well, and you already ran out of money from the last paycheck, so what the fuck are you gonna do? Go to work sick? No, you call in and wait for Friday to get that money. And soon enough, you have more sick days than you should, because the heroin never lasts as long as you need it too. So you get fired, and at the worst fucking time too, because you're getting evicted in 4 days. Rent money seemed like such a distant problem when you were flying high on the 747 of heroin( they were fire stamps!), but after your crash landing it hit you. Every problem you put off, every ignored phone call from your parents, every day of work you missed. Those were big fucking problems, and they still are. They're in your face, screaming at you to get the fuck over yourself and get back to your normal life. But the devil on your shoulder is here to stay, now that you've tasted his poison. The sweet, sweet poison your buddies all call heroin. Ya, they're all living on the streets now too. You never thought that you would be worse off than you were before you used, because that depression was terrible. You were so successful, but it's hard to balance on the pedestal your parents set you on, and you were getting tired of it after 20 years. You stayed up a little longer once you started h, but it's hard to balance while you're nodding off. And it all caught up to you. The track marks, the stolen money, the dirty needles littering the floor of the trap house you're staying in, it all fucking caught up to you. At this point, there's no turning back, and you need 40$ to get through the day. Recovery is, not surprisingly, the last thing on your mind. At least when you need to get high.",1397147931.0

Anywho - me and my boyfriend have been together 4 years and I've been using that whole time, it's always just gotten more and worse as time went on but hasn't put a strain on our relationship until about a month ago when me being out getting drugs more than I was home with him finally took it's toll on him. He couldn't deal with it anymore. I can't blame him. I was putting everything, including pills before him. So he tells me he's done, he wishes me the best but he can't do it anymore. I don't grovel but I insist that this can be worked out so after about an hour he says we just need a break to clear our heads.


Fast forward and he asks me to come back over (hasn't given me my key back but were moving in the right direction) I'm staying the night, he misses me, loves me, etc. All is well.


So today he wanted to go to a movie and I agreed until of course, dboy rings and dboy is good.. Fuck. I tell him that I have to run out really fast and I'll be right back. He says okay cool, he'll roll with me.. I refuse.. Tell him I'll be right back and I'm not a child - his face drops and he knows what's up. He simply says, with a face that broke my heart ""you're putting it first again"" and told me to leave.


So I walk out the door.. Then 5 steps out of the walkway I remember how hurt I was when he told me everything about how I put everything before him and how much I do love him and dammit, I can't lose this asshole.. And march my ass right back in the house. 


I am by no means the greatest person in the world, I have hurt the ones I love so much, I make myself sick sometimes but I refuse to lose anyone else in my life at this point because it just isn't worth it to me. Yes, I will still use but I won't tarnish and jade anyone else in the process. Sometimes ya just gotta know when to say when.

I see the veins hugging my skinny knuckles and remember reading that with a little practice, a sloooow injection, and a slow pull back to register (so the vein doesn't collapse from the lack of pressure, I believe), these could be quite viable.

These veins kind of run round my knuckles; or rather, there are two, one of either side if a knuckle, the curve of which the vein follows, meeting its brother below my knuckle on the back of my hand.

So, fresh pin in hand, I had a go...

And it worked surprisingly well. You need your most study hands- something in a YouTube video happened to be full of fart jokes which nearly derailed the whole process but ever the stoic I continued.

I did this three times and pierced my skin four times, so there was only a problem registering once. The veins roll a bit but if you can handle rollers elsewhere that shouldn't be a problem for you. The hits left little lumps that obscured the little veins so you can't do the same thing again in the same veins straight away - not that you should be doing this anyway!

I read somewhere that you shouldn't be deceived - though these veins can look rather juicy, like those on the tops of some people's fingers (remember, take your rings OFF folks!), they are very small, and it wouldn't take much to blow them out.

BONUS COMMENT:

Sometimes when I have to IV in places that aren't my 'usuals', I practise registering with a needle filled with saline solution, salt water. Every damn time I've done this I've registered beautifully- today for example I popped the needle into a vein I couldn't see, but was placing by memory, and on pulling back the barrel filled with red hot clouds of glory, straight away. So my drug-filled needle goes in, almost exactly the same place, same angle...no luck. This happens a ridiculous amount. I know that registering in a syringe of saline might -look- more impressive than in one filled with thicker, darker drug water, because the blood is more miscible in the solution, but the very fact that I'm registering in places that I then can't hit at all strikes me as a very cruel example of Sod's law...

I left my house around 820, walked to his crib making it there by around 9.  Normally I either do just like 1 bag before going back to wherever I am staying and only if I'm pretty sick.  Well today I decided the walk bak was gonna suck and I wanted to get really high so I did 2.5. before leaving.  Did it and walked out.

Here is where things get interesting.  I didn't realize how fucked up I had just gotten until I realized that I was essentially having dreams while walking and was acting certain things out in my head which translated to  some REALLY weird body movements.   Like I didn't even realize where I was walking at all,was randomly stopping and crouching with my eyes closed, having conversations with people who weren't there all while nodding out hardcore and kind of walking.  Literally had like 3 people in there car stop and ask me if I was ok and another few who were on the sidewalk did.  

So I realized I'm walking in the complete wrong direction and barely even knew where I was.  I only did 2.5 which is a bit more than normal but this batch must have been fire because I've seriously never been that high while trying to walk.  So I finally point myself in the right direction and head towards home.  It had been probably an hour at this point when it should have been 15-20 max.  

So now I'm walking along and soon realize I've been like half crouching half falling over so I pick myself up and keep walking.  As I stand up I see a cop car pulling over.  I had 3 rigs and a couple of bags left over right in my pocket and started mentally freaking out.  I seriously thought about running but even as stoned as I was I realized it was a horrible idea and he probably couldnt do anyhting if I acted ok.

So he gets out of his car and starts asking me all these questions, why I was falling over if I was on drugs, where I was coming from and going etc.  I was like noo I'm not on drugs just had a really long night got dumped by the girlfriend which is why I'm walking back to my parents house now.  I think what helped me was that I jokingly asked him for a ride home, I was like I really don't feel like walking the rest of the way if you want to give me a ride.  He was like no you aren't very far and chuckled a bit. 

Then he let me go.  I acted like that a few more times on the way home, seriously couldn't help it.  It was so fucking lucky though, I've never been close to that fucked up in public before.",1397241498.0

----

I found 2 reasonably clean / sharp pins in my room, so the plan to snort it was out. All the pharmacies were shut for the weekend so I had to buy a bottle of lemon juice (I've had to do it a few times and haven't had any problems yet - touch wood).  
So I go and grab 3 bags, 1 for tonight, 1 for the morning after and 1 for the night after. Now I just needed a place to shoot. The only problem was it was like 8:30 at night, most of the shops were shut, all the public bathrooms were shut, the only place I could find was McDonalds. But even there, as it was so late they'd shut the bathrooms and just had the baby changing room open for people to use.  
The place was packed, as soon as someone would leave the bathroom someone else would go straight up (clearly having been waiting). There was a security guard walking about the floor as well (which I'll come back to later) but by this point I was majorly sweating, getting into proper sickness so I convinced myself I could be quick enough.  
I figure if I can just get in there, quickly cook up a shot then leave to do it somewhere else, I shouldn't take *too* long. So I go for it. The bags down here come tightly wrapped in cling film (saran wrap in America I think?) so it takes a few minutes to open them. I've got everything laid out on the sink, I finally managed to dump the powder into the spoon when the door opens. ""Oh, the lock doesn't work..."" is about all I can think. Luckily the person didn't see what was going on, I tell her I'll be 2 minutes and she leaves. I tried to re-lock the door but there's  no point.  
So now I'm rushing, desperately trying to get it done. I can hear people outside complaining about how long I'm taking. I'm trying to cook the shot but the fucking lighter is barely working. Just as I'm cursing it and wishing I bought a new 1, a black kid just throws open the door and starts saying wtf am I doing. Then he realizes *exactly* what I'm doing (I've got a spoon and lighter in my hand and needles on the sink, it's pretty obvious) and kind of stutters, asking me can't I do this somewhere else. At this point there's nothing I can do, I just need to get out of there as quickly as I can. I apologize and say I'll be quick while continuing to prep the shot. He shuts the door, but now I'm *really* rushing, I can hear him outside shouting about how there's someone in the bathroom injecting drugs, I know it's not going to be long before the security guard comes over and most likely tries to get me arrested.  
Luckily the prep was done, I threw in a filter and quickly draw up the shot, chucked everything back in my pockets and book it out of there. I didn't even cap the needle, just jammed it in my pocket (I had another 1 so I figured I'd just switch to that to actually do the shot).  
Once I got 2 streets over I checked on the shot, I had it plunger down in my pocket, something which in the past has led to me accidentally squirting it into my coat. So I flipped it round, putting the spike down first into my coat pocket and hoping no one saw anything.

I get another street over and realize it's pretty likely the the security guard called the police (its a Saturday night so they're all over the town center) and gave a description of me. So now I need to find a place to hit, but I also need to keep off the main roads - great. As I'm wandering around I start to plan for getting caught; if I need to run I don't want this bottle of lemon juice slowing me down, so I throw it in a bin. I'll just swallow the bags, but they'll find the used filter in my pocket, better throw that.

Anyway so I managed to find a spot (crouched in some bushes in a park - classy as ever), reach into my pocket for the shot, and it's gone.  
I checked all my pockets thinking maybe I moved it, nope, it's gone.  
Fuck. Ok it must have fell out my pocket, I'll just retrace my steps and it's bound to be on the floor somewhere.  
I went all the way back to the McDonalds, scanning the floor on the exact route that I had taken earlier... Nothing. It was gone.

By now I was done, I'd been sweating so much / looked such a state I couldn't have met my friends anyway, my legs were hurting so much that I desperately wanted to just sit, etc etc.  
I'd had enough, I was just going to go home, shoot a bag in peace and bury my head in the sand until Monday.

But wait, it's not that easy. I'd thrown out the lemon juice, there wouldn't be any shops open around my area at this time of night to buy more, and without it I couldn't cook a shot. So I had to walk all the way back to the bin, stick my hand in and grab out the lemon juice, something which got some great looks from the people that saw me.  Great, now let's just get to the bus and go.  
But wait! I can't just walk down the main street, like I said I'm pretty sure the guard will have called the police and it's now been just long enough that they'd have got to the area / be cruising round looking for me.  
So I take the back roads where I can, but the last ~1/2 of the journey is right out in the open along the main roads. As I'm walking along them I see police car on the other side of the road (it had a divider in the middle so the only way for a car to get across would be to go down to a junction and turn round), he's going pretty slow so it's easy for me to lock eyes with 1 of the officers. He stares at me, craning his head to look at me as they go past, then turns to his partner before the car speeds up, clearly trying to get to the junction. Fucking brilliant.  
Luckily there's this little underpass nearby which has 4 exits. I run down into there hoping to lose them and come up on the other side. One of the exits goes to the bad part of town where all the drugs are, another goes into the town center, the third goes to a bus station and the 4th is where I came from. So I head out the exit to the town center, aiming for the bus stops. I come out onto the street just in time to see a police car screech round the round about and head to the bad part of town. I'm presuming it was the same car and they figured that as I was shooting up I was probably heading to the rough area, but I don't know.  
So I quickly head to the bus stop and finally catch a break, the bus is there and leaving in literally 2 minutes, thank god.

I'm sick as hell by now but also physically exhausted. I somehow managed to fall asleep on the bus and woke up nearly home.  
So I hopped off the bus, got home and shot a bag. Now I hadn't used on top of my script for a little over 3 weeks by this point, so I figured this bag should rock me. Nope, it's clearly shit gear. Of course it is.

But it gets me well at least. Which immediately brings on the realization that I've bailed on friends that I hadn't seen in years, friends that were just starting to trust me again, to score a few bags. My, what a prick I am.  
So as I'm wallowing in self pity I figured fuck it, I'll do the other bag now and just ride out the sickness tomorrow like I should have done in the first place (gotta love that junkie logic, eh?).  
I prepped it, registered, shot... and missed. I couldn't believe it, my last bag and I fucking missed!  
That was it, *that* was the final kick that pushed me over. I burst into tears, I couldn't stop myself. All the memories of every shitty thing I'd done over the years for my habit were now fresh in my mind, and I'd missed my last fucking shot. After a night from hell I just wanted to pass out, and now instead I had to sit there and nurse the painful lump on my wrist.

I'm sure there are people here that will tell me to man up, that just last night they had to walk 15 miles in the snow, barefoot, uphill both ways just to watch someone else shoot some gear, but oh well, it is what it is.

----

Edit - God damn, I just shot the wash of the 2 cottons to get me through today and Christ was it hard to do!  
One of the reasons I stopped is my veins are fucked. After 3 weeks off I was hoping they'd be better but nope, still fucked. The last shot I did (before this weekend) I was drunk so I missed, it's still numb / a bit swollen so I can't hit there. My other go to spot I missed in last night so that was out, and my 3rd one I just couldn't get for some reason.  
So I sat there poking myself for 30 minutes. I poked myself so many times I blunted both the needle from last night and another old 1 that I cleaned. I was well on my way to blunting a 3rd when I remembered about a year ago, I'd been binging *hard* so my veins were fucked when out of desperation I'd hit a tiiiny vein around mid knuckle on 1 of my fingers.  
I tried that and oshit, I'm in! I started slowly pushing down and it hurt a bit, but I did remember it stinging slightly on the way in  anyway so I didn't think anything of it. I must have put maybe 15-20 units in when I noticed a lump forming... greeaat. I pulled the pin out and a load of blood / the shot came out, even more when I pushed down on the lump.  
As an absolute last option I let out a little prayer to Junkie Jesus, promising that this was it, if I could just hit I'd stop. There's another teeny little vein that runs down my thumb, I jammed the now quite blunt pin into it at the knuckle closest to my palm and pulled back a stream of red. Oh fuck I'm in a proper vein! I was shaking so bad it's a miracle I didn't miss it, but somehow I got it all in there.  
Junkie Jesus came through for me so now I've got to clean up, I can't break my word to the big J-J now can I haha.

I hadn't been to visit lately. It hurt a lot to see him/her in the hospital suffering. I ran from the pain, like I always do. I want to numb the pain and embarrassment of not having been in my cousins lives. The last time I saw them before the funeral they were toddlers and babies. They all know each other and I'm a stranger. Heroin took that time away from me when I was deep into my addiction. I didn't give a fuck about anything except getting well. The kids are too young for me to explain to them why I haven't seen them in 7 years. I know that some of them must hold this against me, I can see it in the way that they automatically answer my questions quickly with pre-formulated answers. They live far so if I see them, I'd probably end up spending the night. I can't have methadone and H and rigs on me, not with little kids running around. God forbid they went through my stuff and found all that. I can't not go because that would be even worse and they would hate me even more.

What the fuck is wrong with me I've been trying to quit for two years now and it's been a total failure. The closest I got to quitting dope was doing a half point every two days and now I'm back up to using a point a day again. I've been able to quit everything else, it's been two years that I'm clean from crack. But not heroin. and it's taken the most away from me. In my head I'm always making up excuses not to go to down on my methadone, like oh you can't be dope sick you have a midterm this week. All the while I keep going up and up on my juice because my doctor thinks ill stop using because everything else in my life is stable.

Here I am sitting in bed and I keep debating doing that point. I'm so exhausted from not sleeping this past week.

i met this great guy off a dating website. he's my age (24), we have tons in common and generally just vibe really well. before (and after) meeting, we text all day long pretty much and talk on the phone at night. he's nothing short of perfect to and for me. it's so hard to find a guy who is caring, engaging, truly into my personality, looks, etc, caring about my life, educated, great to talk to--all that shit.

i figure i'd get hurt either way so i dropped the bomb on him about my addiction problems and painful past because i'd rather he leave before we even met than get more hurt later. he's surprisingly been supportive beyond belief, even helping me look into treatment options, apprehensive but totally there for me. even offered to help go to clinics with me as i'm having trouble finding a sub doc who will take me and work with my insurance. methadone is looking like the more viable option. he even offered to help pay for my treatment he cares so much. 

we met and find each other irresistable physically and personality wise. i've been motivated to clean up but i'm truly inspired. he basically told me he would get serious with me but he just wants me to be clean. i never thought it was possible for me to find someone so wonderful and i don't want to fuck it up.

i will say finally that i want to clean up for myself but he is a huge inspiration, yet another incentive on top of happiness, employability, being able to support myself financially, to use my bachelor's degree finally, to make myself and my grandma proud. i know people can be full of shit but i think he is very serious, as am i. seeing him again tomorrow. 

what are your thoughts on this situation? any input would be great. my grandma pays for my insurance but is stingy about paying for any mental health treatment like this. if i had a job i would pay myself but i can't work til i'm stable. 

i know it's crazy in a way to enter into a relationship when you're working on yourself but i feel it would be just as foolish to pass up such a wonderful person in my life. i'm scared and hopeful.

So most of you may have saw my post yesterday and the one before that about how me and my boyfriend split up because of me always being gone copping, he didn't want to be with me anymore, changed his mind, I came back a week ago, all has been well and I'm on subs and was hopeful. If you have no idea what I'm talking about, it's all good, I just need to get all this shit out of my head before I combust. Sorry for the wall of text beforehand.


So me and my boyfriend have been great ever since he let me come back, getting along great, I got some subs so I could hopefully take a brief break and get my mind together. Now, my bf is one of those very meticulous, OCD, picky people. He likes things done a certain way, very detached from feelings at times, thinks with his head, not his heart and come sometimes come off as cruel and cold. Well, we've been together nearing 4 years and I'm used to it at this point but there are still times when he really does break my heart with the things he says and the bad part is, he just doesn't see why it hurts me! So that gets frustrating.

So last night, we start arguing again and it just gets progressively worse and worse - he has a habit of knowing certain things that make me more upset so he uses it against me.. He's one of those people that aims to hurt you when you argue with him while I'm not like that at all. Anywho, I tell him how I've been trying so hard and watching my every move just to make sure he's happy and won't kick me out again at the drop of a hat - in short, it hurts that he has all the power over whether the relationship ends and he uses it against me.


He proceeds to flip it around and make it as if I'm attacking him.. This is all my fault. If I would have just done what he wanted me to do how he wanted me to do it, then we wouldn't be so bad off. He blames all our problems on the fact that I just won't do what he says, how he says it, when he says it. Wow.


I break down completely in tears because this is text book emotional abuse.. I mean fuck, were one step away from ""I punched you because you made me do it"". So I'm bawling crying like I haven't in awhile.. That painful cry that sucks. I'm so angry with myself and with him because he doesn't care that he's hurting me, he doesn't care that I'm doing everything in my power to not make him mad and make sure he's happy.. It's still not enough. 


He puts his headphones back in and starts listening to music and I lose it. I start screaming so he stands up and screams back ""WHAT! WHAT!? I DONT FUCKING CARE! GO CRY SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!!"" At that point, I'm shocked that someone can be this cruel to the person they have been with this long and I feel partially responsible for creating this monster and really stupid for dealing with it. I never wanted to be the victim or the battered woman but here I am. So I walk outside and fall apart, punched the siding of the building and I see white meat.. Fuck. 


So today I'm sporting a hand that's busted open with a band aid and I took half of my suboxone strip (normal dose) this morning so the pain isn't too bad. But idk know what to do anymore. My whole reasoning behind cutting back my use was because of him. All I want is to be with him but it all seems pointless now.


I'm really sorry for the rambling guys, I just have no one to talk to about this and I feel more comfortable on this subreddit then anywhere else. Is this even worth fixing anymore? Am I really that bad of a person? Do I really deserve this because I'm a shitty junkie? Again, sorry for the wall of text guys.

Happy nods - <3 you guys.",1397490516.0

I am also working on sourcing materials to make organic withdrawal supplements which will be available the same way.

* What kind/size of needles / syringes do you use? Do you have a favorite brand?
* Would you be more inclined to buy the products or send in artwork?

2) I've got a good amount of 2mg bars, and I was wondering how long you'd have to take them before you start going through WDs when cold turkeying.  The last thing I wanna do is WD from both, after knowing people getting seizures and shit from benzo withdrawal.

I've been using pieces of bars throughout this week.  I'm pretty sure I could take a full bar with no blackout issues, 3mg or more may be too much lol just to give you all an idea.

so now I'm sorta seeing this guy and we've had sex a few times and the problem is that i have zero libido. it honestly takes a lot to get me in the mood and it takes a lot to KEEP me in the mood. i don't orgasm easily, actually, i dont really orgasm at all, or not as intensely compared to pre-opiate sex. and ill also get tired after like 20 minutes and its embarrassing. this guy has CRAZY stamina too and i just honestly can't last that long and i feel like a weirdo. he's never done opiates so he doesn't truly understand that my situation isn't an ""i don't want to have sex with you"" and that its an ""id be a crazy fuck bunny if i wasn't on opiates"" kinda deal. I've talked to him about it but i just don't want him to feel like its some sort of excuse.

How do you girls deal with this? Is there anyone else that feels this way? How long after quitting all opiates does it take for you to get your horny back?

I bought 4 stamps of #3 heroin. I've tried most every drug, and just about last on my list was heroin. No tolerance, never used. 

So I took 20mg the first time and started sweating buckets and was vomiting for 12 hours. Didn't enjoy it at all. I tried again today. I took 20mg and divided it into 6 doses. I took some dramamine before hand and ate some and it helped a lot. I took 2 lines, waited, 2 more, waited, last two. For about an hour I felt really good. Not ""better than sex"" as some people describe. Just good

So I have 3 stamp bags left that I don't want. I know that if I get addicted to any drug, it will be amphetamines. They are my personal favorite. I don't want to throw it away. I want to sell them. But I have no one to sell it to

Anyway, did I not do enough? Or is this how heroin is? It seems to be wildly overrated. I have no desire to do it again. It's nice for an experience. But it's not something I want to repeat. I want to be Fucking wired. 

I know I'm not making much sense. Sorry. I wish I could just give one of you guys the rest of my great though. It's pretty good shit if I understand correctly.",1397437787.0

A little background - I was somewhat desperate yesterday and having since cut off 2 of my close friends that were dealing to me since they fucked me over (some of you may have read about it) I only have 2 dboys I go through now. So all he has is subs, I still looked for an hour after that and couldn't find anything so I said fuck it, he sold me 3 strips for 30 - idk if that's normal pricing as I've never actually bought them before but I said fuck it - worst that can happen is I lose out on 30 bucks.

I make sure that I wait until at least a full 24 hours has passed until I take my first dose (quarter of a strip) wait an hour, I still feel shitty and W/Ds are still there so I take more and an hour later I feel a slight buzz (NOT what I was aiming for - I didn't want to get high off of them, just wanted to not feel WDs) so I think ""hmm.. I'll take that"" 



Fast forward to this morning, I wake up and I still feel great. No WDs, no anxiety right when I get up because I can't get high.. I feel good. For the first time in a long time, I feel damn good and I'm not worried about my DOC. I honestly can't even believe it. I'm waiting on this to explode back in my face somehow.



This might be something good for me. I have been using since I was 17 and I haven't felt like this in awhile. It's nice to not sit and obsess and let the almighty dope gods consume me first thing when I wake up. It was nice to clean my house without having to have dosed beforehand.



Not I may be jumping the gun, but this seems like it might be promising and if anyone had read the thread about me and my bf splitting up briefly (not because of my blatant drug abuse but because I was gone all the time COPPING and he no longer felt like he was important) this is so promising to me. I might actually be able to put my family, my relationship and everything first again. And it's a really good feeling. Even if it's just for a little while. I'm not sure if I want to quit forever.. I'm not sure if I'm ready to end this 8 year relationship with opiates BUT I may just be able to finally put the ones I love before my use. And dammit that makes me happy. 



Sorry for the wall of text but I just had to express this to you guys. Even though I'm still a fairly new user of this subreddit I have never felt more cared about and welcomed in my life. I honestly feel like you guys are my distant junkie family and I love you all. Wish me luck. Even if it's just for a little while, I'm happy.

Instructions say don't crush, break, dissolve etc.. as it can lead to instant release, but according to a huge number of discussions on the web about this, the XR remains in place due to some kind of binding which is prevalent throughout the pill - which doesn't correlate with the instructions.

This is a neighborhood where we for sure stuck out, especially sittin. idle on the block in our car this late at night. We left the meeting spot, but couldn't contain ourselves- we wanted to get HIGH! So, we pulled a few streets down and parked down the block, at an adequate distance from where we had grabbed. Now keep in mind, this truck is a Ford F350, so not only Is It a fuckin beast, but It has massive built-In toolboxes as well making it near impossible to keep a look out.
My man was the driver, so he goes first.... he decides to turn on the light, which I repeated tell him Is a bad Idea (as It Is late at night and just about anyone who rolls by can see exactly what Is taking place), but he does It despite my warnings. 
Cut, crush, (lift the surface), sniffff... as he performs the lift, sniff step in the process a cop slowly crawls past. 
My heart literally sinks into my chest - FUCK. Fuck, fuck, he saw! The piggy continues to crawl until he hits the street not even 5 feet away and puts his lights on. ""Fuck- move baby- NOW! GO, GO!"" We proceed to pull away and dip the fuck out faster than anything. At this point it is obvious that the lights were not for us and the proximity was simply a coincidence. 
Thank you junky jesus! This beautiful day was not going to end with us withdrawing behind bars. 
For a second there I thought it was all over (not only would we for sure be arrested, but he most definately would have been fired for driving the company vehicle. Not only was he using the truck for personal use, but coping in the city- holy fuckin shit balls).

I hope everyone is having a wonderful Monday! Anyways I've been maintaining a pretty substantial roxy habit over the past few months and was planning to start taking subs this week. 

However next week I'm supposed to get two teeth pulled and a while ago I read something about how it was super dangerous being put under on subs? My dentist is a very good family friend so him knowing anything about my use is not an option...So I guess I'm wondering if I will be ok or if I should stop the subs a day or two before and stay well on a few 30's?

I tried shooting up for the first time today. I fucked up. I registered fine at first, but then I guess I slipped out of the vein somehow. I got high, but I didn't feel a rush or anything and it wasn't that instant (although it was still pretty quick, a bit quicker than snorting).

There was a lump on the top of my arm, which I assume was the liquid I injected. I put a cold compress on it, and that lump is mostly gone. Also at the time, the vein I shot into basically got like raised up on my skin (I assume it was a histamine reaction). Dunno how to explain it, but I'm pretty sure it was an allergic reaction. It was only on the vein itself, basically around where I shot and a bit lower (closer to my hand) too. Either way, it went away now.

My only question is now (and also right after I shot), the vein in that area looks kinda purple, almost like a bruised colour. Is this normal? I have very visible veins and you can normally see a faint blue through my skin, but now it's like purple-ish. Did I blow the vein? What happened? I just need a little bit of reassurance.

Here's a photo of what I mean. It's a shitty pic, but you can see some of the nearby (normal) blue veins, the injection site (red dot near the freckle), and the purple-ish vein complex as well. As you can see, it's pretty faint, but I have no idea what it is: http://i.imgur.com/YKENkUG.jpg

Also, the spot I shot in is a bit tender/sore, but I'm pretty sure that's normal and will probably go away soon.

Thanks for the help.

P.S. How does one normally adjust a snorting dose to an IV dose? Is IV twice as bioavailable, or less than that?",1397509864.0
