Like almost a year. Since then ive taken kratom and sometimes little bits of methadone, but off of the spending hundreds of dollars a week on heroin fentanyl mix off the street though, and since dnms got all fucky i havent bothered loggin back in. 

So my life is slowly, slightly getting better, i tell myself, it really isnt by normal standards as im stuck spinning my wheels it feels like, for reasons, but about once a month like clockwork, down to the fuckin day, i get really different feeling, i feel like i used to feel all the time, somewhat more creative, calm, in touch, but i also really really really really really really really very much badly so want to get a bag of smack and get high. Its never good anymore, the dope is cutup fentanyl death garbage heroin and i get so sick to my stomach off it and spend all night in the bathroom throwing up skittles and various sour candies. 

But i still want it. I discarded all my numbers, so i have to cold cop , but its all the same shitty dope anywyas. 

But  my dgirl was like the only person i liked and now that i cut her out of my life i miss her badly, i really liked her, i didnt just want to fuck her either, i seriously would have been fine just hanging out wih her for a few here and there. Im really worried about her, i am thinking of sending her a present, what should i buy for a stylish girl teenage drug dealer? I hate to admit this, but if i find out she died i will be super jealous of her. I know how fucked up that sounds but just thinking of losing another friend to the eternal mist makes me feel so lonely, its almost depressing getting high off dope i didnt buy from her, i domt know how to explain it better than that. Its just this fucked up feeling. I smoke so much pot to distract myself but lately it just gives me mad introspection and i hate that shit all the time. 


I remember being strung out, i remmeber withdrawals, i dont want that, i just want to snort a tiny bag and feel that touch of bliss again, its brutal sometimes. Oh well. Hopefully some u lil niggas can relate. Anyone just want to die sometimes but not really at the same time? I feel like i know what i want but also i dont and even if i did i wouldnt be able to get it 

Does anyone want to start a gang with me? We will wear leather jackets and talk like the fonz

He looked like a regular dude but in work clothes more or less. 

What I *did* notice is his arms were goose bumped and he looked cold as fuck but it wasn't particularly cold outside. He seemed like he had a bad cold so I figured he was in WD and needed a fix.

There's no H where I live - just pills btw. Anyway, he asks me if i can spare a couple bucks and I give him a $20. Something I've wished would happen to me for years when I was asking people for cash a long time ago.

I don't think he expected me to give it to him. I think he thought I was going to pass the $20 for the dollars I had alongside it and give him just a couple of those lol.

His eyes got huge and you could see the fucking relief wash over his face - I was his answered prayer and it felt **amazing** to be the good guy for once.

I told him it was none of my business but, I said, ""now that you got cash, do you have a solid place to score at?"" He looked at me like he hadn't decided if he was going to lie or just say fuck it and cop to the truth - he went with the truth and laughed and said ""Yeah, man I do.""

He thanked me over and over and we parted ways. I'm sure I'll see him again. I'm pretty sure I've seen him around.

With that said, due to various fuck ups (insurance, pharmacy, defective product), I’ve gone through withdrawal several times over the past ten years. Every time, obviously it sucks. The pain is excruciating (since that’s why they are prescribed... in excessive doses). The “sick” sucks. All of it. However, I don’t actually ever get any kind of “craving”. If I have to be off meds, I deal with the physical symptoms and yes, I know in my head what would “cure” the withdrawal but I’ve never been to where I’m fantasizing about it, thinking of doing something crazy for it. Is this weird? I feel like people on here are constantly talking about their triggers. I take meds for pain, and I take them conveniently doses so it’s more fun than it potentially could be. And again, I am a huuuuuuge fan of being high. Kind of pointless post, just curious if anyone is similar. It could, of course, have to do with the fact that I know I have pretty much unlimited access (save for the handful of fuck ups that have happened over the years) so it’s never really a panic like I think I need to go on forever without... random Saturday thoughts...",1517718556.0

Bud has been freaking out the past 2 days about getting gel pens, as many as possible with as many colors as possible. He has...

Even though not a proper miracle, it helped and it's a godsend.","I've combed through hundreds of research papers looking for something that was different from commonly prescribed SSRIs/NDRIs and other common medications.

I picked up in one research paper that depression can cause your endogenous opioid levels to drop (strange thing is that the data in that paper was trash, but the premise was sound) and also found Tianeptine in other overview research paper that was comparing various atypical antidepressants (that do not act directly on serotonine or dopamine).

At first, I was a bit concerned about taking another opoid that is mju receptor agonist for prolonged time (because it basically means addiction).

But when I tried it...it worked almost instantly. It's not all happiness and peaches, but at least I can fairly confidently say I am no longer depressed (or at least not as much depressed as before).

The question I am pondering is whether I should have a stop after let's say two weeks for a day or two, just to test the addiction potential. Tianeptine is short-acting (few hours), so getting clean of its effects, including withdrawal, shouldn't take longer than two days.

Anyone here took Tianeptine for longer periods of time (months, years)? Could you also comment on tolerance build up?",1517709873.0

It never became a problem until about 3 months ago. I went on a bender, getting high almost every day for a couple weeks at a time then using sub to avoid withdrawals. I shared a needle with my ex boyfriend (whose been known to hang with some seedy people) like an impulsive fucking idiot because we copped out of town and I couldn't wait to get my fix until I got my own clean needle. Fast forward a month and I start feeling like shit, nausea, fatigued, and I chalked it up to the wear and tear of iving drugs into my body. Well after about 2 weeks of throwing up almost every day I notice that my eyes have a yellow tint so I go to the ER. There, I was diagnosed with acute hepatitis c - viral load being almost at 3 million. I am so disgusted and ashamed. I feel like a leper. I feel utterly alone. I know there are great treatments out there now a days and it's ""curable"", but I am scared of the side effects (fatigue, nausea, hair loss). I hate that I got myself into this situation. I hate heroin. I hate that I still crave it. I hate that I feel so stuck in limbo  from this diagnosis that a warm shot of some h right into my vein sounds like the only thing that could make me feel ok. I hate this. I'm scared and so sad.

So this may a be a bit long, but if you're high and have a minute, give it a read.

Quick run down of how I got to where I'm at. Joined the US Army after Highschool. Found myself in some shitty situations, tried heroin (smoked it) for the first time and got my leg blown off 3 days before coming home (amputation below the knee). Got all rehabbed up, nice little medical retirement, plus disability and some other allowances for having a fake leg. All and all comes out to about $3700 a month. Got pretty bored at home not doing shit so I moved to the country my Mom came from, Ukraine. 

Now 3700 USD in Ukraine is a fucking fortune, and boy have I lived it up and I've been here since 2012....

Ok, now you're caught up. Every day I drink about 6 liters of beer, 1 liter of vodka, pop 2.5g of Alprazolama and smoke 1 gram of that sweet sweet brown Afghan H. Thats just to not get sick. If I wanna get fucked up, It's usually much more than that, plus some coke. Obviously I didn't start off this way, but this is where I'm at now, and I've been at this level for about 6 months, it will only get worse from here. 

I recently had a situation where I took too much H (I think it was cut with fent or something else) and experienced an overdose. But who knows, with all I drink and the benzos I take. Either way, its time for me to get clean. So I went to a doctor here in Ukraine and they literally just said ""Just stop doing all that stuff""....yeah okay dude. 

I have pretty good insurance, its called Tricare and they cover some inpatient treatment and medical detox. Detoxing here in Ukraine isn't an option. The hospitals here look like the fucking movie Hostel. My current plan is to get to the American Hospital in Landstuhl, Germany, check myself and have them do their thing.
 (this is the same place I was MEDEVACed in 2010). I'm just wondering what you guys think. Am I too deep in this bullshit and should I just keep living this life until I die in the next couple years (or months), or should I get my my car, drive to Landstuhl and try to survive an alcohol, benzo and opiate withdrawal? Would love to hear your opinions guys and gals. 

Also AMA, I know I've lived quite an ""Alternative"" lifestyle as my very disipointed mother tells me lol. 

Love you guys

UPDATE: Ok guys, I've decided I'm gonna try to get some methadone (or the Ukrainian equivalent) to travel with, as crossing international borders with 10g of H just seems like a bad idea. I'll have enough benzos to get me to Germany and can pick up alcohol along the way if I need it. Going to see the Doc. Tomorrow and see what he says about the methadone script then head west. My car is big enough to sleep in and I've got plenty of money saved up for hotels. I'll keep you guys updated.",1517686122.0
7v1dal,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7v1dal/withdrawal_travel_advice/,2,https://redd.it/7v1dal,PontiffTheGreat,Withdrawal + Travel Advice,"Heya,

So im returning home from overseas, where I had access to a fair bit of Codeine and Tramadol, ongoing mild intermittent habit for a couple months prior. Talking 500~mg of codeine 3-5 times a week. I dabbled with H and oxy sparingly but codeine is the DOC and average tolerance as aforementioned. I detoxed and withdrew about 3 weeks ago (10 days CT) which yielded a moderate  (relatively) but nevertheless quite uncomfortable withdrawal (mainly potent anxiety, lots of diarrhea, massive physical weekness and above average dissociation (have an anxiety disorder). But it was done. Then lapsed for a week and stopped briefly before departing (currently day 3 CT). Withdrawal this go around is minor; no diarhea/nausea, minor aches, lethargy, runnt nose, chills. No insomnia either time (I also take quetiapine [a potent anti histamine sedative] and tapering off 0.25-0.5 mg xanax nightly however, I can up the quetiapine as needed. Lovely drug.)

Overall feeling pretty decent, nothing major and my country has recently discontinued OTC Codeine so im getting clean. **The question is; Im about to embark on a 2x 11 hour flight and 6 hour layover Journey, I have a small amount of Codeine, 3x 37mg IR tramadol and 2x 100mg ER tramadol. Im thinking should I use some prior to-and on my second flight (ideal sleeping flight) to alleviate symptoms, then get home and finish up the detox, i dont believe this will be a real issue as far as prolonging WDs as im going to be totalled for 10 days with jetlag malaise anyway. And its warm as shit at home. Or would you just stick it out?** Not take anything and take what I get. Also finishing my benzo taper (only 1~month moderate use) upon returning.

Advice appreciated.",1517685253.0

Any ideas?,"TLDR: i just shot a speedball with a little less coke than usual and unexpectedly started nodding out whilst writing this post on how much I love speedballs. Now it's a lost about unexpected nods, too. Still nodding hard, going with the pirate eye lol. Asking for ideas and experiences from you guys regarding the nod. I'm a bit afraid that fent might become a thing around here. How long would the fent high last tho? 






Today I had to take the TOEFL (Test Of English as a Foreign Language, for my masters application) which means that when uni starts on Monday, I didn't really have any free time between work and uni except the rest of today and tomorrow since... Christmas. Tho Christmas doesn't really count. Had to study for the oral exam I took in Jan. But at least I had some time off work then. (My last 'vacation' was my ibogaine treatment in Spain last spring. It worked as advertised but I didn't and relapsed anyways lol.) 





So naturally I feel like I have to use this free time wisely and treat myself. I kinda rushed through the TOEFL and finished first. Then the notorious auto pilot in my head turned on and I scored some dope (got a good deal on it too! He threw in one extra bubble bc I waited in the cold until I couldn't feel my hands anymore only to find that he doesn't have coke). So I had to get the girl elsewhere. Thought for a sec about ordering the coke taxi but then I'd have to buy at least a gram. And that's a dangerous amount to have for me. I gotta be up and running by Monday! And so I waited some more in the cold. The coke man came by car which he usually doesn't. I waited where we usually meet, headphones in, eyes locked to the screen, when a (very small) stone hit me. And I was like - is someone throwing rocks (pun not intended) at me? Well it was him lol. 




Anyways, what is super weird is the following. I prepped a shot and put in a little less coke than usual, but just as much dope as before, not more, maybe even a little less. I wanted to continue to tidy my room, but when I took my phone to turn on some music and share my joy on reddit I noticed I was nodding off bc I had only one eye open... Instead of doing sth about it (that was at least an hour ago) I'm still sitting here enjoying the nod and browsing the internet. Haven't even removed the tourniquet yet lol.
 I was so focused on speedballs during the last months that I kinda forgot how nice it is to catch a simple nod off of dope and not only to get me to sleep.  




But what worries me is *why* this happened. Has the time already come that our dope is being cut w fent? My tolerance is super high, usually it takes a lot to get me nodding like this. Especially since I had been using about 1.8g dope on top of my 1000mg maintenance morphin during my binge, just to provide some context. Especially when there's coke in the shot. Like, ftw How did this happen? Any ideas? Experiences? 




 And dude, I'm still nodding out. Typing this took forever and I apologize for any lack of coherence, grammar or spelling. I'd really like to have another shot but this nodding is crazy... Just was out again!





PS: I'll follow up with dopepr0n when I do the next shot.

Dose to only 8 mg per day.

After starting Suboxone I noticed that I was getting A LOT MORE emotional and I would start crying while I was by myself thinking of past events (things I've never done before).. 

So like I said to make a long story short I've been trying not to use Suboxone because I do not want to be on it anymore but I have two pieces of my spine that are fused together which causes me tremendous amount of pain.  For a while Suboxone did help but lately it has not been doing the job and it's been excruciating. 

Not sure what to do considering there is no pain management (as far as I know) while on Suboxone. 

Yesterday I didn't use the box in which didn't seem to be a problem because I started using Xanax to help with the with withdrawl symptoms, but today is a completely different day and I can feel the sweaty palms, heart palpitations, Extreme anxiety , etc..it's the cold sweats that's really killing me right now (not to mention it's fucking freezing where I am)

TL;DR Can someone tell me how they did it themselves after tapering off from a very low dose of Suboxone to know Suboxone at all with minimal with drawl symptoms? ",1517672548.0
