For reference right now I am on percocet as I just had surgery, and I am going through it pretty quickly, plan on buying some bupe illegally and then making the choice of either trying to get back on kratom or going to a sub doctor.

It burned for a few seconds, but I was extremely lucky that the coffee wasn't scalding hot. 

I have a very strong Type - B personality. I drove back around and explained to the woman what happened without yelling or anything. She apologizes and then proceeds to hand me another fucking coffee in a bag. She also tells me that is their policy when you get cream and sugar on the side. In my head I was thinking she might be the dumbest woman alive.

First of all, when I was on methadone I found that I was getting a little buzz from it pretty much everyday (took it for 5-6 months), and I really wasn't even upping my dose all that much. Where as with subs, after the first week or so, I really don't feel too much in terms of a buzz. IMO methadones buzz is more ""heavy"" I guess... Also, when I get on methadone, my sickness instantly stops when it kicks in. But on subs, it took me a few days for the sickness to fade out. Like I was high on the subs but I still felt sick, a weird as hell feeling I didn't even know was possible.

Probably the most important point I'd like to address though is shooting dope/using your opioid of choice on top of these meds. It seems using on top of methadone is much easier for a variety of reasons. One it's just easier to ""shoot through"" it, and two you don't have to worry about those god damn triggered (or whatever they call them) withdrawals like you do with subs. Despite this though, I've managed to stay on subs now for a few months, and because of the effort it takes to use dope on top of it, I really haven't used as much as the months when I was on methadone a while back. 

I feel like when I was on methadone, I was still an addict, I just had a reliable source for an opioid. Now that I'm on subs, I feel like less of an addict, I'm still using benzos now but I find they synergize a lot less with the subs, and I've pretty much quit using stimulants because the subs aren't ""heavy"" enough to counteract the parts of stims I don't like. But anyway, I wanna hear what you guys think. This is an interesting subject that I don't think I've seen discussed all too often.

btw, I'm only talking long term here, like months to years, not short term tapers, but if you wanna discuss tapers too that's fine. I think that subs are probably best for a rapid taper, especially seeing as how they don't even get you fully well or anything the first few days. but I've never had experience with tapering off with either so I can't say for certain.",1456774652.0

(Long shitpost)","Hey guys. I've been snorting h for roughly 10-11 months now, with a few shorter (mostly involuntary) breaks. Right now I am 6 days since last using, I went to my uncle who lives in a town 4 hours w/ train from home, to get away for a while. The situation at home is really strained right now due to me being a dirty junkie and stealing basically anything worthy to pawn or sell, which of course was discovered by my parents. (I moved back home to them after having lived with my then gf for 3 years. 

Mid-november I could no longer keep up the lies and the lack of money so I told her about my use (said it was oxy though, b/c of stigma) and our 4+ year relationship ended basically immediately, although she was very supportive in the beginning. I don't think I'll be able to forgive myself for fucking that up. I miss her every single moment. Fuck.

Anyhow, I moved back home and made an honest effort to stay clean. For 10 days. Went to NA, which was pretty good, supportive and stuff but I don't really buy into the whole philosophy and I'm not religious in any way. But it was nice to just sit there and listen and talk. I was also trying to get help from the social services, which are usually pretty good where I'm from (northern Europe), but very slow.

On the tenth clean day I had gotten my paycheck and I woke up alone and completely miserable at my parents apartment. So I picked up. I kept going all through my birthday, christmas, and didn't have a clean day until jan 1st, at which point I woke up hungover, broke and in wd with no possibility to cop. Cue three days of misery before I could get a front, and then I kept it going until 6 days ago.

Roughly 8 days ago, my parents found (or well, didn't find) all the shit I had pawned or sold and said it was time for something drastic. I was sent here to my uncle (whom I love, we're very alike in many ways. I'm just bored out of my fucking mind). Brought the last of my dope which I managed to sneak up my nose until it ran out 6 days ago. I'm going home sunday for a meeting on monday, where I will be informed whether or not I've been approved for a treatment home of some sort. It's, according to my parents, the only way right now.

I suffered pretty mild withdrawals because the past month or so I've only had money for 1-4 bags a day (so roughly .1-.4 g of pretty fire stuff) because of lack of money. When I quit for 10 days my habit was between 3-8 bags a day depending on funds, so those withdrawals were horrible. No sleep aid or benzos or anything. At least this time I've had lope for the first 2 days and ambien for sleep, which has helped somewhat.

However, a question; I am still feeling really cold all the time and get shivers constantly. I also still yawn all the time. Is it common for these effects to linger? I also sneeze all the time but I guess that's not wierd to linger because of snorting. The constant freezing, shivering and yawning is annoying, though I'm relieved to be almost entirely rid of the skin tightness, aches, RLS and horrible lethargy.

Whatever, I understand if you won't read this, I'm just bored as shit in my uncles van. I'm gonna suffer through these last days, go back home and buy a single, last bag. That leads me to my last question.
Now, I know, a ""last"" bag in that sense is probably just wishful thinking. But hopefully I'll get into treatment right after so I'll be able to quit for real. But I'm wondering, using 1 bag on day 10 of being clean shouldn't bring back withdrawals right? Because in that case I won't do it. But it shouldn't right?

Sorry for rambling, just felt like sharing. Haven't shared my addiction with anyone, used completely by myself and lied to everyone I know. So I guess I'm just looking for some sense of community. ",1456923407.0

Just got my lope in the mail","I've been on a whirlwind opiate bender for a few years now. It started off just experimenting a few years ago with codeine extractions. I quickly hit the ceiling effect after more frequent use, so my dabbling was controlled. 400mg every third day for the longest time. Then I crossed paths with an oxy dealer...wow, the difference. Needsless to say, I loved oxy waaaay too much.

Luckily that supply ran dry before terrible addiction set it in, but  codeine just didn't cut it anymore. I eventually got onto store bought poppy seeds and quickly learned I could get waaay more morphine from a batch of brewed tea than I could from codeine conversions. For a while I maintained a moderate to low habit of dosing a mix of the PST and CWE, with the odd oxy I could stumble across. 

The past 8 months though have been bad. I have refined my PST process and using several bottles and grapefruit juice, I was able to convert 2lb into 500ml of liquid morphine and this began to take hold. I would use every other day and I can noticeably feel withdrawal rearing it's ugly head when I go 48 hours without a dose. This past 3 months have been worst. I'm dosing more days than not, I've quite exercising (which was my only lifestyle choice that kept me from turning into a full blown addict). I'm living with my girlfriend now so I realised I needed to stop. She went away on Sunday night so I planned to quit by the time she returns. I've used half of her time away to enjoy myself with a couple of strong teas, waiting fro my lope to arrive in the mail that I ordered two weeks ago from the US (way cheaper over there). It came today, so I made an extra large batch and have literally just finished it. I'm praying loperamide works even half as well as some of the addicts on here claim as the plan is to use it as a withdrawal aid - no PST for taper as I literally can't reduce doses on that stuff.

Girlfriend is back in 4 days, so hoping I've peaked in withdrawal before she returns and have some life in me by Sunday night. On an ironic note, I filtered my PST really well, reduced it on the stove and I got the cleanest tea I've ever made - none of the rank, dark oily shit I've consumed every other day in the past. I wish I used the filter a while ago, because I'm pretty sure the filter has collected most of the dirt and oils the seeds are also covered in and left me a pleasantly clean opioid concoction.

Day 1 tomorrow. Hope the lope saves me and I don't cave in. I'm expecting a rough few days but his is my last hope. I've never dosed more than once a day and never binged more than 4 days straight, so hoping withdrawal isn't the nightmare some fulltime tea drinkers describe.

Cliffs: After years of opiate abuse and a solid 8 months of regular PST, I ordered 200 lope tabs and am looking to quite from tomorrow. Funnily enough I figured out that filtering the tea before reducing on a stove yeilds a much cleaner, oil free tea on my last dose. Hope the lope works out.",1456902766.0

But, the status hasn't yet changed to ""Refund Sent"", which is obviously what I'm looking for. If this is accurate, then I'm worried that even though my direct deposit date is March 2nd, if they haven't even sent it yet, that it won't actually be available in my account till a day or two later. If they don't send it until today, doesn't the whole direct deposit/ACH process take a day or two for it to actually show up in my checking account? I just want my moneys!!!

I started spending a lot of time with people who used them a lot and starting using them more frequently than I ever have, and come to find out I like them a lot more than I thought I did. I didn't realize how often I was doing them until one night I didn't do any and hadn't had any since the night before, and I started feeling really shitty. I did some and miraculously felt better, at that point I realized I had become physically dependent on them.
I have no desire to be completely sober at this point in my life, but I don't want to do any drug every single day, especially not because I need to to avoid physical withdrawals. Since I've never liked opiates much up until recently, I've never had a problem with this.
Today is my first day clean (well- I took a little bit of a sub to avoid withdrawals). My plan is to kick the physical dependence and then go back to occasional use.
Any tips on how to do this without ending up back where I started? I'm pretty good at using responsibly but the physical addiction aspect of opiates is something I've never really dealt with with other drugs or understood until now... Definitely a game changer. Thanks in advance",1456886634.0

I did more than 5 joints a day, with tobacco inside.

Since I started the addict route, after not so many months, the MJ high was literally destroyed for me. The body high dissapeared, and the -universally known but also hated- Paranoia kicked in. I tried my best to smoke less or even change strains, but nothing; niente. 

I think that being an opiate addict for some people, rewires the brain, and makes the 'mind-opening' qualities of mj (even indica), to be highly unpleasant and paranoid-ish. Some times, it even 'erased' my high and almost brought me into pre-wd phase. I always had to unnecessarily re-dose.

I literally quit after those months, and now my -then beloved plant- is something that makes me want to vomit even when I smell it.

Weird thing is, other co-junkies friends of mine swear by the combo of it all. However, they  don't use benzos.

He would move mountains for me, and I can't even suffer through a few days of withdrawal for him. I don't deserve him. Ugh. But all is ok tonight. I have been high all day, I still have dope left. He's satisfied. Smoked a bowl just now, feel great. Now eating leftovers of Panda Express (Honey walnut shrimp of course) while I watch the bachelor.

I didn't belive it, it was so good to be true that it has to be an error,  so a few hours ago I went into the pharmacy and ask for Hydrocodone, I was expecting that they will ask me for the prescription but guess what? They gave me 20 pills (7.5mg/325mg) for just $18.

I left the pharmacy astonished, best $18 I have ever spend on my entire life. 

So tell me, how hard is for you guys to get some Hydrocodone?

I got so much writing done, so I'm going to try again tonight, but I feel like I'm in a position to get ripped off because I don't know what I'm talking about.

This will be the first time I'm buying on my own and not splitting with someone who knows more about it. 

how much should a folded over little package of D cost? about what should one of those things weigh? is there anyway to compare the ""strength"" of one of those (relatively speaking depending on quality, I know) to a perk 10?

how much is a ""bund"" supposed to cost? 

the guy i've done it with before always buys it himself and shows up. we shoot the shit, he says he ""hooks"" me up, and then he's on his way. but i can totally imagine that i'm subsidizing his highs by throwing in more than my fair share for what we split.

To be clear I am not interested in getting high, I legit just want to be able to manage the pain with what I have been given, unfortunately it takes 6-7 of these 2mg pills to have much effect orally. I have read about the bioavalibility of hydromorphone orally being essentially worthless. I am not interested in attempting to iv these pills, however I routinely take b12 injections IM and am comfortable with that, does anyone have any experience and can anyone offer a bioavalibility for IM injection and any experiences? ie dosage and time to feel some relief?

My reasoning is I would rather use as much of the active ingredient as possible rather than eating 7 pills, I'd rather inject one or two.

first in regards to the legal advice of don't talk to the police and have an attorney present i will point out i do not live in the USA or a country with laws similar the the USA. refusing to talk to interrogators can be held against you and used against you as evidence of guilt. 

second an attorney is not allowed to be present during the interrogation. 

now i passed the interrogation and my lawyer says they have no evidence on me so this is pretty much over except for getting all the shit they took from my house thinking they were drugs and drug related items when they weren't. 

no drugs were found in my house although my eyes were red once i got home from the interrogation and every night since and i plan on them being red tonight as well. so HAHA to this pigs for not actually finding what they were looking for.

I'm sure I'm not the only one to experience this. Just wondering what others had experienced and especially if you have any tricks to relieve these odd side effects.

I noticed if I'm taking high doses for a long time (any opiate, tho oxy is my doc), I will start getting these really weird thoughts. It's not exactly hallucinations...more like dreaming while awake. Like yesterday I started to think oh no, I forgot to take my dog to the vet and the will charge me for missing the appointment. But I don't have a dog lol. And then I would sort of wake-up and realize it wasn't true. Like I said, high doses for a long time and these thoughts begin and don't really stop until whatever I'm on wears off. It's kind of disturbing b/c this is what I imagine it's like to have schizophrenia or some other severe mental illness. As I said, I don't hear or see things that aren't there, just have all these strange scenarios that seem intensely real (oh god, why did I flush my stash...no wait I didn't do that at all). 

The other thing is difficulty swallowing. I often have this when I'm on oxy and it can be very scary. I've almost choked to death several times. 

Just wondering what your experience is. Especially on the first one. I remember when I worked in a hospital, we had an elderly woman who had a broken hip but said she was 'allergic' to morphine. When they asked her what kind of allergy she said it made her go out of her mind. So they gave her something else, I dont remember what, and she went effing crazy...yelling, screaming, saying ""you fucked me in the ass!!!"" and she was like a sweet 86 year old lady.

Today's events (and some of the comments on this thread) have pretty well convinced me not to fuck with dope, at least at this point in time. My boyfriend OD'd today. I got the call at work. Found unresponsive in his car in the parking lot of his work. He was taken to the ER where they were able to revive him seemingly with no lasting effects. On his health, anyway. He had 3 bags and a couple rigs on him when they found him. He already had a warrant for bail jumping on possession and paraphernalia charges, so he's going away. His life is basically over. Another person I love taken by heroin.** 



Throwaway account because discretion.

Let me preface this by saying that this is not a decision I have made lightly or on a whim. You can tell me not to do it if you want, but it won't change my mind. I know very well what heroin addiction can do to people, I've seen it first hand. I'm mostly new to opiates, my only experience being with tramadol and percocet taken orally in low (but enough to get a high) doses. I am not new to drugs, however, and have plenty experience with things like DXM, LSD, ketamine, MDMA and weed.

I know that dosage is largely based on quality, but can anyone provide a rough guide to figuring out the best dose for a first-timer? I plan to IV. I have IVed K before, so not totally new to me, however I normally have help because my veins are shit. I will not have help this time around, so am thinking I will need to use the veins in my feet or hands. Will this be problematic? Like I said, I'll be alone (I don't have anyone who would be on board with this to be my sitter). Are there any extra precautions I should take? Any other tips or advice are appreciated.

Few questions","I have been off oxy since January after tapering down over a few months and quitting almost cold turkey, taking about 4 mg of sub spread out after living hell for almost a week.

First I want to say this sub has helped me in more ways than one.  Reading and interacting with other people who understand has helped me more than I can put to words.  The past few months logging in here during work or at night while I've had cravings and talking with you guys and reading or sharing a story has actually helped me to stay away from getting high. 

My problem at the moment is I have had so much stress that I really have been craving opiates.  Now I'm not clean from anything besides opiates, I drink a couple nights a week, smoke weed here and there and I've done coke a handful of times the past two months, but I have been clean off opiates.  I'm afraid if I pick up once I'll be right back to railing 300 mg a day so I know I'm not trying to go down that route anytime soon.  My real question is about taking a piece of a sub. 

If I take a small piece of a sub will it help me like it has in the past while addicted? 

 Will I crave opiates more after? 

 If it's not a horrible idea to take some how much would I take after being clean since the beginning of January? 

If it's a bad idea and more likely to lead me to using blues I don't want to do it but if it may help me get though this rough patch than I really think I'm going to.  I'm sorry if this is a shit post but I don't have many opiate friendly people in my life to talk anymore as most are either clean and super judgmental now, in jail or way to deep in the game for me to even track down.  

Any advise would be greatly appreciated.

Personally, using 15-20mg doses up to 3 times per day (once every two weeks or every month) give me no withdrawals nor harsh comedown, only a subtle melancholy for the high which goes away watching tv and having a drink.


But I am sure doing it in higher doses for several days can have dire consequences?

I was gonna surprise him with a visit over spring break. When I was looking at airfare this weekend I had to ruin the surprise for arrival/departure and turns out that the day or two before his close family came for a surprise visit

The last three days I've had one goal- to get him on the phone and ask him whether or not postponing the trip til later when it's better for him was a good idea. Well, it took from Saturday until midnight tonight (Tuesday/Wednesday) to get him to call me

When he did he used all three years of our life together against me, making sure to confirm very strongly that every insecurity I've ever expressed is true. He said ""I don't love you"" like a fucking robot 

I'm fucking devastated. He's the love of my life but it appears that in the end, our views and opinions of what a relationship ""should"" be apparently don't match up for him even tho I've made sacrifices that are almost indescribable to make sure he was comfortable 

So I cried on the couch while talking to my best friend on the phone for about an hour while continuously railing lines of H. Nodded out/passed out while sitting up with the lights on. I also tilted my head a bit to the right and woke up when my whole shoulder and pec were soaking wet with drool lmao 

I had another bag of slightly lower quality stuff that id gotten this morning and used for the election but put it away when I got the better batch. Spent 45 minutes lookin for that thing snd finally found it in my wallet during my 67th search of it.... So now imma get blasted again and hopefully catch some ZZZ's instead of sobbing like a damn baby

He was everything to me. I trusted him. I believed him! Fuck it all, I am so far beyond upset I dunno what emotion it is


Also, this had nothing to do with my habit if you're wondering. He's cool with substances, but it seems that for a partner/husband he only accepts alcohol as a legit way to get fucked up. ...

My heart has never been broken before, and this is basically like a dementor kissed me and taken my soul before I could cast the patronus. It hurts. It scares me. He was so mean that im still in fuckin shock that he could even have that ""side"" of him!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**TL;DR Version** : Get phonecall from dopesick friend at 6am, says hes been super sick since like 2am. Hit up main dboy with the fire tar(and we get some xans) says to meet him at his work before he clocks in at like 10:30. We get there 10am, he gets there 10:15,  badabing badaboom. Take a xanax bar in the car for the drive home, chill with homeboy while he smokes a point to feel better, then I grab my shit and head inside to shoot up.

 Find a brand new needle along with an unopened 8mg suboxone ( have a script but i'm running low and not getting another) so i'm like fuck yeah. Spend all afternoon high (i've had lots of diff kinds of tar from lots of diff people and places, this stuff gets a solid 7.5 maybe 8/10), make bomb lunch for father and I. Finally hear back from a psych i've been tryna get ahold of, get an appointment for tomorrow(well today now, Friday). 

Radnomly (well, not randomly, he goes to stuff like this all the time, i'ts mostly for older people and it's Dad says ""Wanna go to wine tasting and get drunk and see 30-50 year old total babes?"" (Parents are divorced, dad is 64 but parties like hes 28 sometimes) I say ""fuck yeah!"", so about 530 I get high again, we out the door at 6pm, drink all sorts of wine, dad knows a bunch of people there so we just kick it. I'm pretty fucked up since I took a half a bar along with my shot prior to leaving the house and the maybe bottle of wine i've had so far. Nobody my age there really but the older women(some not so hot, some meh, but fair share of ones I for sure would bang esp drunk). Get home, make a bomb dinner for one (dad ended up leaving with one of the ladies so one of our family friends gave me a ride home), then like KO'd at like 9'oclock. And here I am, well now it's 3am but awoken at 2am.


Yeah so that wasn't really a **TL;DR** sorry guys. I'm still kinda out of it. And I suck at condensing things. I left out a ton of small/minor details that added a ton to making this a ""good day"". It just kinda helped me out of a funk.

 (IE: Talking to mom for an hour OTP, facetiming one of my best friends back home for 20-30mins, talking to this girl where were kinda in limbo of like liking each other but shes waiting for me to come back home to really start ""talking"" despite us banging a few times over winter break, etc.).

Sorry for the shit writing and formatting or whatever. It's 3:08am, I am a mediocre at best writer anyway, and it's hard to express my ""good day"" without telling/explaining a bunch of shit y'all prolly don't care about and/or making the story far too fucking long. So yes, I know its written shitty

So yeah. Tell me about your (true, recent as of a week or so, and preferably opi or drug related) day!

""How long can a good thing last""


Here I find myself on the chase again,the never ending journey of chasing the next great high...hoping this time will be better than the last...but it never is. They say the anticipation of pleasure or pain always greater than the reality of it...but who the fuck are ""they"" anyways. I fuckin earned this after the day I had today.  

&nbsp;

Merely a fucked up day at work now become the excuse to get high again. Knowing I would be coppin is what got me through the day, I would have probably left work early with some half ass excuse just so I could cop sooner. Right now my wife and child are sitting on the couch at home waiting for Daddy to arrive, but Daddy is scoring heroin tonight..... I sit in my car and listen to the raindrops hit the windshield, I  know that my own inner peace is o. Its way....it's 8pm....do you know where your dopeman is?  

&nbsp;

I know where mine is, hes upstairs weighing out my dope sack and I'm sitting here like some wannabe writer trying to make my ramblings worth reading. Waiting to taste that first bump of heroin... as it make its way into my system...like a dog waiting to be fed. Makes sense why they call dope ""dogfood""   

&nbsp;

How long can I continue on wasting money like this...? Working 110 hours every 2 weeks but always coming up short when the bills are due...should be a deas giveaway right?....What's ridiculous is the price of my dope..I've managed to secure cartel level prices but still can cop small bags. It all about knowing the right people. What I pay per gram is far less than some pay when copping  weight direct from the across the border. I sit here and wonder how people could afford this shit at 5x the cost I pay.  

&nbsp;


While my addiction pales in comparison to some habits, I am without a doubt addicted to getting high to stay sane. Mentally I am chained to the need to escape my own mind, to get away from myself and detach from reality.

&nbsp;



I find myself constantly on a mission for mental freedom, to quiet the voices in my head that never stop filling my head with madness.  

&nbsp;

It's a vice that helps me cope with my own inner demons...when I'm high, all self doubt is erased like magic, all my worries and anxiety seem to melt away like an ice cube in Death Valley. Tbe feeling of achieving that high makes me feel as though I'm able to just enjoy life for what it is...one hell of a fucked up adventure. When the tar is running through my bloodstream I feel like I can simply just live normally (but what the fuck is ""normal"" anyways?)  

&nbsp;

Yes, my mind and emotions have been permanently altered completely, if I recall correctly its something to do with serotonin and dopamine level being all out of wack. I'm well aware that this isn't normal, but in the life I have lead it's as close to normal as I can get.  

&nbsp;

Time and time again this rat bastard addict jumps back into that same wheel in the corner of my cage, hoping it will somehow lead to somewhere different  

&nbsp;

The wheels keep spinning but I get nowhere. Time and energy wasted, and zero progress made in moving forward...I take 2 steps forward and then ?my fall back down 10.  Somebody's gotta fix those fuckin 12 steps...seriously  

&nbsp;



""I spent my time searching and seeking  
&nbsp;

 Looking for my purpose and meaning.

&nbsp;

..I know I need Jesus so please tell him to call me when you see him""  &nbsp;

This pile of pale brown powder stares back at me, and I swear it has a voice of its own.  Raspy and raw,   

&nbsp;

 ""I see you're back again 
...just can't leave me alone can you? Even if you wanted to...you know damn well you need you piece of shit. I mean cmon..let's just keep it real, you fuckin love me. Go ahead and try to leave me, 
There ain't no moutain high enough to keep you from getting to me, and don't ever forget that""  

&nbsp;

I stare at the business card I'm using to scoop bump after bump of dope to my nose, a quick snort escorts this sweet brown sugar in my system. Even with a habit I've managed to remain a functional user. While I have gone off the deep end many time in my life, I have somehow managed to maintain an image that is almost a polar opposite of my true self. I've held every position and have had a successful career in my field and I do contribute some of my success to drugs.  Crystal Meth help me work through insane hours and push through workloads that would make some throw in the towel and say fuck it

&nbsp;



 Overtime? Count me in.!..who needs a lunchbreak when your tweaking right? As my focus was on a level that was simply unfuckwithable...I'd bullshit my way through ever case that touched my desk and my results were bulletproof. I was unstoppable on meth. Awards and recognition for my dedication were easy accomplishments when on dope, everything just magically comes together and the bullshit would flow off my tongue like Niagara Falls. But after the second or third night of no sleep, everything gets weird...you start seeing and hearing things. The ""shadow people"" begin to appear...appeared if you've ever done crystal meth for awhile you know about them. You think you see someone or something out of the corner of your eye, but as you turn to look....nothings there. This is why you see tweakers eyes darting all over the place. The paranoia was the biggest mindful of them all though. I've gone through far too many meth psychoses episodes with extreme paranoia. 
It always feels like someone's watching you, or like everyone knows what your doing
 ""The know I'm on dope...fuck ! fuck ! fuuuuuck!""

&nbsp;



This would lead to some clearly odd behavior and I'm surprised I was never called out on it. At its peak I'd be convinced the cops where going to kick in the door at any second. Staring out of the peephole for like 10-15 minutes watching the hallway..the madness would just get worse and worse. That's the part Im really glad to be free from...always thinking people are watching or following you is a mental marathon that will drain you.

&nbsp;

As the pile of dope slowly gets smaller and smaller, I feel my tension begin to melt away as my eyelids become heavier. All those years of smoking meth##r= left me with a case of insomnia that will likely never go away. Ambien,xanax,serouel, otherwise sleepin pills, drinking, sex/masturbation and meditating have done little to help with this. The idea of finding a way to obtain and covert liquid propofol into a snortable form has crossed my mind more than once. When Michael Jackson said he ""just wanted to sleep"" I truly understood his pain.

&nbsp;

 I've prescribed myself the one thing that manages to put me to sleep I'm  help me....black tar...see it all started with me hooking up with that famous white bitch Vicky (vicodin)

&nbsp;
My life has been a vast myriad of predictable bad luck, unexpected good blessings, and tragic miracles...

My story is an ongoing testament of my existence and hopefully these writings with help people understand why I am the way I am (and perhaps shed some light down this dark rabbit hole of my life.

My life is an unwritten open book and I'm happy to share it all with you, YOUR COMMENTS AND VOTES LET ME KNOW YOU WANT MORE...and I will gladly keep this going.

(its kinda my only option as of now as i been trying to stay clean off dope! Almost got two months of no dope use hell yeah longest time in years)
(IV sub is horrible on your body, i think tex is a little gentler than oxone, but i so is shooting heroin/coke cut with god knows what)

but i think i found a way to live a life free of the d-boy and somewhat normal. 
I get my subutex not subox from a doc and when i was transitioning it helped iving especially when living in a shooting gallery and i started experimenting with doses.
I was iving 2mg at time and first week it did give me some euphoria.

But after researching doses of bupe used for pain management doses of 300-500 MICROgrams seems to be the dose being used.

So lately I have been iving just tiny pieces of my 8mg sub roughly 400-800 micrograms based on getting 12-16 shots from the one sub. This should approx out to about 500-666.66 micrograms in each shot. I still do not get that awesome DAAM rush, but damn it has been giving me finally a satisfying dose of Sub.

I recently ran into a good amount of xanax and adding a bar or two before my shot omg. It has been giving me a pretty close feeling to DAAM.

For ex. i had eaten a bar did my shot was smoking a cig started nodding incredibly hard and having not hallucinations, but i would come to after having what i thought i was having conversations with people I hadn't seen in year. Like talking to an ex, a brother, other etc. about gibber and i come to and no one is there at all, still all by myself. i know part is the combo but jeez i was nodding so hard i was talking to people and coming to and no one was there.


So maybe is this bupes golden spot a iv dose of 300-700 micrograms? even without the xanax i can somtimes still nod, albeit no imaginary conversations. It definitely keeps me my opioid needing much more manageable than a taking a whole 8mg SL.

I think at this dose im keeping the bupe at its more agonist effect and am getting more nor-bupe the good shit.
 
i dunno i just never have nodded this hard since some high quality ecp DAAM, let alone be rambling to people i truly think are present to find out its just me.
Bupe is super strong as we all know but i think depending on your ROA a lil experimentation on a effective dose can get you some strong agonitic opioid like effects.",1457071281.0

I have recently slipped down the slope and my heroin/oxycodone plus benzo usage has increased to 200-300mg heroin (smoked) and sometimes 20-40mg oxycodone (insufflated) if I manage to get hold of some. Benzos anywhere between 5-30mg Nitrazepam, 10-30mg Diazepam, 1-4mg  Alprazolam a day (not more than 2 different benzos in larger amounts a day).
**Worth mentioning I have been fucking around with opiates for about a year (starting with codeine + tramadol -> dihydrocodeine -> oxycodone -> heroin) and ignored all warning signs of course...fool. Still no regrets ya live and learn!**

The thing is I have gotten into the habit of mixing smallish amounts of various strength benzos and tramadol whenever I'm smoking my heroin and I am interested to know how dangerous this really is.

I have a fair benzo tolerance (been fucking with them for a bit longer than I have opiates, only taken diazepam -> etizolam -> alprazolam -> clonazepam -> nitrazepam and I have been taking diazepam, etizolam, nitrazepam and alprazolam *not mixing high doses of course* semi-regularly, but I digress) and wonder if mixing these with opiates day to day is very dangerous, it feels great! Take tonight as a regular evening as has been the norm daily for the last couple of weeks or so; this evening for example I have taken 300mg Tramadol spread out in 2 doses 3 hours apart along with 10mg Nitrazepam around 6pm, another 5mg Nitrazepam at midnight and another 5mg about 2am (now 2:25am) so 20mg overall.
Sometimes I'll mix 10mg Diazepam with 1mg Alprazolam and 200-300mg Tramadol while smoking Heroin and bongs. Or 5-15mg Nitrazepam with 1-2mg Alprazolam with 100-200mg Heroin etc. I'm keeping it relatively low all low to minimise risk. Worth mentioning I'm 22yr old 5ft 6in male 10 Stone (63kg or 140lbs).

Is this dangerous? What do you guys think? What does anybody else like to experiment with?

I haven't been here in a while, so I came to check in on my cake day to see how everyone is holding up :)

The reason I haven't been around much is because I got back on methadone maintenance and off the streets again finally. I have been making more of an effort than ever before this time, and I knew this sub would be a lot of temptation during the first bit of my sobriety, so I decided to avoid it for a bit. I haven't done any opioid since the 10th of December 2015, although I do indulge in cocaine when I have some extra cash, and am slowly doing it more and more.. An old friend came by out of nowhere with $1000 that he wanted to spend recklessly. We did so much fucking cocaine, and it was damn good white too. It ended up being too much for him, and he broke down and left for detox. I kept going at a 2-3g/day habit plus ridiculous amounts of klonopin and valium, and was doing 0.4g shots and shit.. There was like zero dopamine or serotonin left, so I just got the negative effects and none of the good ones. Decided I needed a break, took a week off, and today I copped about a g for $60+a pack of smokes, 0.92g. I managed to split that into 5 hits instead of fucking two, and am getting way more euphoria than I was.. by far. When I do cocaine, each shot is bigger than the last, and the last hit is always the largest by a fair bit. I call it the Grand Finale haha. After that I usually pop some benzos, take some tylenol (get bad aches+headache crashing) and lay down with some herb, cigs, something to drink/nibble at and watch some movies or TV series. 

Anyway, I'm getting ready for the Grand Finale now. I'd say it's between about a quarter gram (0.25g), and I'll have a spliff lit and in my mouth to puff on right when the plunger bottoms out.. holding a hit of herb and getting that rush at the same time is awesome..

I was popping a few Percocet every few days for a real good time during this period. 


First, I read about a guy who took in 300mg of oxy a day on the old 420chan opiate board. Not only was I flabbergasted, I straight up didnt believe you could take that much in a day. A few days ago I swallowed about 350mg of oxy through out the day and only felt not sick. Check. 


Secondly, when I first tried heroin the girl I bought it from mentioned banging a brick a day. Unfathomable. Seriously. No fucking way. If I dont pay attention these days my morning brick will be reduced to a petty 2 bag ""morning shot"" for ""tomorrow"", where tomorrow means 4am because I dont sleep anymore. 


And finally, the old ""I dont even get high anymore"". I thought, no. Opiates to me were always about the subtle warmth, not about the knock you on your ass rush, though thats nice too. Well, I am starting to consider bundle shots at this point. 


So yeah, consider my opiate bucket list complete. Fuck. I have to stop. I do not want to be 25 (birthday at the end of this month ya'll send gifts) and still using the needle. And this is just the personal bucket list. Ive long since completed the general package of catching charges and ODing. So... shit, what now? I guess I stop, right? But how do I stop when waking up sick is no longer just a bummer but a demom spawn in the pit of my stomach that wakes me up in the morning telling me to jump off a bridge or go to Trenton, controlling my brain like that fucked up ant fungi. Shout out to /u/yepnewjersey for doing the right thing, keep it up. 


I guess that's that. Time to stop. My girlfriend/friend OD'd and flipped her car the other night after picking up fent bags, suspected, and being kicked out of her parents house for relapsing. She was supposed to spend the night at my house. Shes not dead, miraculously she is completely unscathed. Long term rehab for her though. I am jealous of her lack of choice. However, I am losing my license on the 15th and start probation (probably) sometime towards the end of this month. So it looks like I have no choice either. I am scared to death that this disease will have me copping dope without a license a few days before a drug test, hoping I'll slide under that closing door.

490qvh,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/490qvh/dui_from_opiates/,61,https://redd.it/490qvh,Vernichtungsschmerz,DUI from Opiates,"So I suffer from a variety of chronic pain conditions (with no cure) and have been put on a Fentanyl patch and regularly take opiates for the pain......that belong to my parents (though I occasionally get my own rx). I was having a rough day and struggling to get out of my own mind and so I just kept taking opiate cocktail until a friend asked me to come over (3am?). I only had access to Norco 5s at the time so I obviously took a LOT and then they take ages to kick in (I am not a fan of snorting, the bit where it runs down the back of your throat makes me vomit)...I stopped counting after 20. I then took 10 (after 10 I stopped counting) oxy, 5 or 6 nucynta (tapentadol), a handful of metaxalone and 20mg diazepam and 3 cyclobenzaprine to top it all off.

As I said a friend asked me over around 3am and I felt fine (which was why I took 5 norco for the road (so from 15 to 20)) but after a couple hours it really kicked in. I had no one to call and nowhere to really go (and I was trying to travel ~2mi) so I thought I could drive to my mum's house (where I have been staying temporarily). I was about halfway home when I fell asleep and clipped a lightpost and broke off the side mirror. Next thing I know I had driven off the road and crashed into some dead bushes. I damaged the whole front R quadrant of the car, it is now totalled. I don't remember the paramedics arriving but I remember being strapped in and they made a comment about my pupils and how I had to be on something. At the hospital they drew blood (which I don't remember) and I remember dropping the urine cup and turning around to fetch it and it flushed instead...so they cath-ed me (OUCH) and then I was taken to jail. Apparently I was questioned and admitted to using heroin (which isn't really true, I have rolling and collapsing veins so I'm not big into injections and if you discount oxy I've never used anything stronger than pot (minus that one time I took LSD)) but yeah. I don't even remember going to jail, I woke up 16-18hr later in my cell and didn't even know I'd been fingerprinted or questioned until I was released.

 I've got a court date on Thursday and suspended licence and currently lost all autonomy. It blows. My mum went through the house and hid all the opiates (and my marijuana) but I found the opiate stash but only taking 1 every 6-8hr for an unrelated surgical wound.

Of course post-DUI I have been put on Naltrexone (though i've not taken it yet as it would block the opiates (and I also am using them for pain since I recently had surgery on my arm to debride an infected dog bite)). I mostly am ambivalent about everything that happened. I'm bummed about crashing the car and losing my licence (until I do the classes and stuff) but coulda been worse.

The one shot of narcan really wasn't enough, the cops should have done it again but, they didn't know if they could. I felt really high for the next 6 or 7 hrs.

Anyway, a short ride to the hospital and an extremely short stay, as I was fine and all they wanted to do was labs to find out what I took, I signed myself out and my lovely and extremely shook up gf took me home. Now instead of being extremely sick I'm extremely sick, have a headache, my chest was stomped on and I have rug burn where she dragged my lifelss body off of the shitter.

I'll give you guys a bit of my history, I have been an opiate user for about 7 years, I remember and started by getting pods off of eBay, then that got banned and it went down hill over the years. I was doing heroin off and on but fairly regularly for two years, I quit for about a year then got some over this passed holiday season, and after going tru 2g (the real two grams not two bundles) in about a week and a half I quit and I promised myself I would quit for good, this was two months ago to the day that I od'd. I have always considered myself a safe user and although I used heavy at times I was always careful and never pushed the limit.

All it takes is once tho, my fatal mistake was misreading my scale.. Instead of measuring out 8mg I measured out 80, I sniffed 40 mg and banged 40, even with narcan, my girlfriend, and paramedics I'm extremely lucky. I did see my life flash before my eyes, I heard voices of loved ones, no light tho just my life spinning maddly around and around. I wasnt scared at all, I'm still not. I'm more worried about my girl than anything, I guess the cops gave her a good shake down.

Thanks for reading, hope I can touch someone so they don't touch dope and put their loved ones tru what I almost did. There are only a couple ways out you guys, you will get out someday that's guaranteed, living tru it isn't unless you make the choice for yourself.

Good luck with it, I'm done.",1457134350.0

I was just introduced to 7-hydroxymitragynine and WTF! Its got it all, super good analgesia (20x morphine) euphoria, mood lift, stimulant at low doses, and sedative at high doses. No body load, no nausea. All for about 5 hours and 8mg of product. The best part is the street price for this marvelous alkaloid is less than 1$ a dose. 

I am told it is less addictive than all other opiates, with mild withdraw, and can be used to taper off any other opiate as it is a MU agonist. 

If opiates are your thing you gotta try this stuff out. It is Bomb.
The best part is that the Chinese have found a way to make it synthetically instead of extracting it. Which means it should soon be flooding US drug markets.

FINAL EDIT: GIVEN UP AFTER APPROX 22HRS SHITS TO FUCKED - GONNA TRY AND RUN AN AGGRESSIVE TAPER _WISH ME LUCK!



So I'm going cold turkey w/ds on U47 again - for the whatever time lost count.  Each time they get worse... but maybe its cause each time my habit gets bigger.

-
-
-


So I've never IV'd but I got up to 1.5-2gs of insufflated u4 per day, I'd put a gram into 10ml of a propylene glycol/water solution. But I'm sure those of you who've done U4 know its terribly caustic and will do a number on your nose.

-
-
-


I've moved onto oral with little powder bumps up the nose here and there (sometimes go a day or two with no nose action).  Those that say that U4 orally is useless just haven't done enough of it.  Yes it takes  a rather large amount to get where IV/Insuff/Assplay will take you with a much smaller amount.  And yes you won't have a rush that the other methods will have (even Insuff to a lesser degree than ass, would not know IV).

-
-
-


Could not tell you how much U4 I injest per day, but it is well within the grams range. I use a metal spoon to weigh out (flat) my parachute doses (ya like a pill capsule is gonna be large enough LOL) I've scaled out the amount of my one flat scoop and it is 200-225mg.  My good morning dose is 2 scoops down the hatch... so do the math.  And yes - you are woken up by WDs at night if you don't redose - hence me setting alarms for every 3 hrs.  However for whatever reason I just can't avoid sweating at night no matter how often I redose (but can greatly reduce it).  It seems U4 just makes you sweat whilst sleeping.


-
-
-

Withdrawal wise U4 is very short (shorter than fentanyls?) but as a result very brutal. For example my last kick which was a mere 5 days ago (long, personal story not getting into it) was so brutal, particularly the RLS, that I uhh punched myself in the face repeatedly aswell as in the thigh to help me ""forget"" about the RLS. It was hard enough for my face to swell and bruise up and have questions from various people of what happened.

-
-
-


But basically timeline of  U4 withdrawal:

Say you last dose like 5PM friday - friday night/saturday morning will be fucking hell on earth

Saturday - shitty but nothing compared to yesterday, if youre like me your RLS will be gone but youll still sweating buckets 

sunday - youll feel shitty but itll be laughably minute compared to fri/sat. you might start noticing the mental shit more because up until then the physical parts were all that mattered.

-
-
-



Anyways I'm going to be starting w/ding today some time late friday - 5pm+

If you guys are interested I can catalog my w/ds to have it put into our data repository lol

However, you must remain with the person needing help (if that person is not you), identify yourself to law enforcement if they respond to the call, and cooperate with any investigation which ensues.

Not sure why, but mid-evening Saturday, my chest / back started to hurt at the same time. I took a quarter of an aspirin (~80mg), hoped for the best, and ignored the problem for a while.

Fast forward several hours later, breathing is hard, and hurts in the same area of chest / back. One of my dearest friends had clots hanging out in her lungs, many years ago - my symptoms sounded similar, so I went into freak out mode. I immediately called my mom at 5am, ET, and woke her up - told her I was heading to ER. Was at my friend's house, so I dragged her along.

I've been here ever since. Previous injection drug use has made it 100% fucking impossible for nurses to draw blood or put in an IV. The first nurse seemed so determined to find a spot, so I humored her, and after like 30 mins (and 10 pokes), she managed to pull like 30 units. They are now calling in an IV Team. Actually, the IV team nurse just spent easily 20 minutes tying me off, flicking my skin, and not finding a single thing. Now, it's time for a sonogram line placement.

I still have no idea what's going on. I used Adderall, and the doc is almost insisting it's the cause of my issue. Seeing as I'm very well versed in Adderall use, I'm calling bullshit - there have been nights / weekends I've done INSANE amounts, and never once have I seen anything more than a mild side effect.

So now, I have to play the IV bag song and dance, like it's going to be a magic cure. At least this way, they'll have access to more of my blood. Chest x-ray was given right when I got here, but I haven't heard a single thing about it.

I'll keep updating as I have more info.

**[edit 1] @ 8:57am, ET**:  Here's a pic of this sonogram IV line they put in. Still, I have no clue what's going on around here. Would be really fucking cool if I could get them to leave in the line. heh. [Sonogram Placed Line](https://imgur.com/QPYqzCX)

**[edit 2] @ 9:53am, ET**: A nurse just came in to take my vitals again. I asked her what was going on - What's holding me up. She went n asked, and found out it was lab work. Ugh. ps- That Ativan is making it so I can't stand up easily.


**[edit 3] @ 12pm, ET**: I was just given a fat shot of Ativan, and 3 caplets of Tylenol to take orally. Then, I was spun off to have a CT scan done - the weird contrast dye that gives you a fucking warm rush.. such a strange sensation. I'm seriously fucking hoping it won't be serious, and that I can leave soon.

**[edit 4 / final edit] @ nearly 2pm, ET**: It was now fucking hours after the CT scan, and we were sitting around, doing nothing. Anytime I wanted info, I'd have to seek out a nurse, and have him try to locate the doc. I was irritated, as we'd been there for about 8 hours. I ended up leaving AMA - silly, I know. I told nursey boy that I'd taken my line out on my own, and he fucking insisted he see my arm before leaving, or he was going to get security. I hadn't taken out out, so I dodged into the bathroom too remove it. He managed to find the doc, and she said there was no evidence of a clot or dissection, again insisting it was the Adderall. Pffffffft!

----  ""Uncut Pleasure""-----



Bright red blood, so vivid it almost appears to possess a neon glow, fills the barrel of the needle. It is loaded with speed, almost syrupy in its consistency. Sitting across from him, she parts her legs slightly, giving him an eyeful of her. They are both naked, and as she pushes off, her blue eyes lock onto his. Pure, unadulterated sexual electricity travels between the two. Her eyes roll back in her head, her pupils dilate, heat spreading from her chest and seeming to pool in her lap. She shudders and coughs as the amphetamines shoot from her pounding heart to her tingling extremities. She gives a coy, half smile as her fingers slide between her slightly askew legs, checking to make sure she hadn't cum from the shot. Her fingers came back slippery, but it's more from the anticipation of wrapping her legs around the man across from her than the dope. It's such a welcome change, she thinks, to not be boffing some geriatric trick. Lying about how good his half-limp dick felt, trying not to inhale the scent of his rank mothball and coffee tinged breath as he  wheezed and snuffled wetly into her ear. Thank. Fucking. God. The man sitting across from her was someone she'd had genuine feelings for since they'd met on these wretched streets a couple years before. They'd both been in relationships when they'd met, but her abusive ex had flown the coop for good, and his girlfriend was in jail, yet again, and she  had invited him to come to her hotel room for a while. She loved getting him high off his ass, then leading him off to fuck somewhere. She'd had him up against the side of a building once, and another time she'd handed him a needle loaded with a heroin and meth cocktail, then dragged him into the parking garage of one of the countless anonymous apartment complexes which dotted the neighborhood. She'd laid down a light blanket she'd pulled from her backpack, lightly bringing him to the ground and straddling him. He'd been nervous at first, but she was even more turned on by the possibility of someone walking up on them. And once he felt the soft warmth between her legs gripping him, he wouldn't have cared if God himself walked in. He loved the way she'd suck him off, teasing and caressing, until he couldn't stand it anymore, begging her to let him in, until, wolfishly grinning, she climbed on. They'd fuck til they were both raw, never resting between orgasms, coming again and again til they collapsed, totally spent and dripping sweat. Two years spent I mm the industry of pleasure sure  gave her an advantage. She knew just how she wanted it, needed it to come, and getting her partner off came naturally,  like bringing an extension of her own body to ecstasy.  She'd taken care of herself, too, and was clean, smooth, and tighter than a lot of non-working gals he'd fucked. Plus, they'd always had this unspoken connection, and it was almost too intense when they came together. He experienced her body as an extension of his own as he pleased her, her moans and gasps triggering little shivers of delight. She was the same way. When she really cared for the guy she was fucking, just watching him watch her making him squirm as she worked him over with her mouth could make her cum.


Yes, such a nice change of pace from her daily routine. She was way past due for a ""me"" day, and she was delighting in this feeling she had all but forgotten. For the first time in so very long, she was absolutely floored by her own pleasure. She forgot about human greed.  And she was loving it.




As wave after wave of meth induced pleasure hits, her mind flickers between random thoughts and carnal hunger for her slightly chubby Adonis. She decides  she'd shoot some heroin after they were done, to stop the jitters and help balance out the speed high. 



She crawls toward him on her hands and knees, hungrily gazing at him from under a fringe of dyed lavender and natural blond bangs, sliding her tits along his thighs, grazing his hard cock as she kisses her way up his body. He moans, oh so lightly, his eyes closed and head tipped back in ecstasy. A soft, moist pair of lips, and a curious, testing, tasting pink tongue delights in the feel of his silken skin, the stubbles along his jawline,  nibbling his earlobe gingerly. She can taste a salty tinge, sweaty beneath the musky scent of cologne. His hand glides up her spine, to the nape of her neck, where he grabs up a small hank of hair, ensnaring his fingers in its short but thick luxury, pulling her head back to expose the delicate skin of her throat. Growling softly, he nuzzles her, then lightly nips all along her throat and collarbones, thumbs rolling her hardened nipples round and square.

His dick tenses as he gets a sensory overload. He can smell her perfume, and he can faintly detect her femininity, a tantalizing combination, so light he could miss it if he weren't in the moment. She is grinding herself against him, her pussy hot and wet and slick, his shaft sliding between her vulva, not penetrating, just teasing. Their bodies are enmeshed with hers, their breathing growing shallow, their touches growing more eager, more hungry for the other. And, as she slowly gyrates in his lap, she reaches to the headboard ledge and pulls her hand back, a rig full of a viscous, clear euphoria. Still with his cock cradled in the cleft between her legs, she has him lean back against the headboard and extend a tattooed forearm, the milky white, soft skin marred only by the barely visible series of pinpricks, and she ties him off. She is an ace, registering in seconds, sending a liquefied home run that makes his toes curl. She watches it envelop him, and as pure bliss gradually washes over his face, she takes his now steel-forged erection and guides him inside her, lingering on the head, then slowly, maddeningly sliding herself all the way to his balls, flexing her pelvic muscles in the fashion one uses for Kiegels exercises, and the two become one, gradually, erotically. This, she thinks, is the pinnacle of earthly pleasures.

I was away for the month of January at an inpatient rehab. Initially I wanted nothing to do with it, as my family was making me go, but eventually I gave myself reasons to do it. My use had gotten pretty bad for a few months because I'd been pretty depressed (not to mention the death of a close friend), and I had an outstanding court case for some BS misdemeanors that I figured I should probably take care of. So I decided I'd take some time off from dope and get some things I need accomplished taken care of. So since leaving rehab, I've been making good on that by taking my subs as prescribed, working on finding some meaningful employment, getting a car (still needs about $900 in repairs, but its a start), and trying to save up to live on my own.

I still partake in occasional use of other drugs, but I'm doing alright so far avoiding heroin (thanks very much in part to buperenorphine). Even on days when I really want it, I don't act on that feeling. Because for the first time since I've ever gone to a rehab, it was actually a decision I made. All the other detox and rehab trips were futile from the start, because I did it for someone else. I had no plans to continue sobriety afterwords, I just planned to ride out withdrawal comfortably in a hospital setting and make my family happy.

I don't plan to stay clean forever. I rarely make ""forever"" type promises about anything. But I do want to get my life in order. Having a bullshit job that I hate, living with my parents, and being without a car isn't working for me anymore. I'd also like to finish up this court case with as little punitive action as possible, and give my tolerence some time to drop. So I'm aiming for 6 months to a year off dope to hopefully get things moving for myself before potentially indulging in any heroin-related festivities.

So yeah, besides rehab being one of the most depressing experiences ever, life's pretty okay right now. I missed this place :) Thanks for continuing to be an awesome community",1457225729.0

Anyways, I'm not a regular opiate user but I felt like sharing this story here because I don't know anyone else who might be able to relate to it.

I've experimented with various drugs over the past two years, mostly weed and pills with the notable exception of coke. About 5 months ago, my weed dealer at the time texted me saying he had some codeine pills. I knew codeine was a weak-ass opiate but I had been wanting to try vics or percs for a while so I said fuck it, I'll take some. I bought 3 30 mg pills and took them all at once. I felt great for about an hour and experienced mild euphoria. Of course, the codeine quickly wore off and I realized why so many people look down on the little fucker. After that little fling, I set out on a quest to find oxycodone or hydrocodone in order to get a better, longer lasting euphoria. I ended up trying and loving them both. I loved them so much that I wanted to do them again. Unfortunately, my dealer got a new phone and didn't give me his new number, so I hit the streets in search of more opioid pills. I finally managed buy some endos off a random guy. However, it took fucking forever to find someone who was selling pills, not to mention they were expensive as hell. (I'm pretty sure I got ripped off but whatever, not important.) Meanwhile, in the course of my journey to find pills, I probably walked past half a dozen dope dealers, any of whom could've sold me a bag of heroin that probably would've lasted 4 times as long as my 2 measly 5 mg endos while costing half as much. I took the endos, remembered how much I loved that blissful feeling of euphoria, and began scheming ways to feel it again. Before long, I was considering switching from pills to dope. I mean, it just made sense. Pills are expensive and hard to come by, while heroin is cheap, plentiful, and pretty damn strong. Even though I've only taken pills 5 or 6 times, I was craving that feeling of euphoria again, and I had almost decided on trying heroin in order to get it. I came to this sub looking for advice on using safely and not getting addicted. After lurking for a couple days and seeing numerous stories about people who started out exactly like me and now have crippling addictions, I've decided that I never want to try heroin. In fact, I never want to touch opiates ever again. [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3mutg9/you_guys_warned_me_yet_i_still_shat_on_your/) post in particular was a wake up call for me. I'm not judging or looking down on anyone, having struggled with addiction myself. But I've decided that I don't trust myself enough to keep fucking around with opiates and not get addicted. So, thank you, guys. Your drug-induced ramblings may have saved me from a world of hurt.

tl;dr- I’m an occasional opiate user who decided to stop after lurking this sub for a couple days.

I have never used painkillers in my life and never intend to do so unless I'm in hospice care dying of cancer or something. However, I mostly use moderate amounts of alcohol and smoke weed on occasion. 

Last night, I watched the new PBS documentary [""Chasing Heroin""](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/chasing-heroin/) and then I learned what a big problem opiates are in our country.

I personally only know one junkie, she is an ex of a friend who prostitutes herself to get money for her drugs. We still go out for coffee on occasion, but I never bring up her drug habits because she forbade me from talking about them.

Plus, I was very depressed before I'd ever tried opiates, and I've always been *very* bad at dealing with my mood. That will come back with a vengeance when I stop drinking my tea. Plus I'm concerned about what it might be doing to my insides. I'm thinking about evaporating the tea so I can just put the pod putty into gel caps, but that feels like a +1 to my addiction level... god forbid I start using dope...

All this said, I don't *want* to stop using. I just know that I can't keep it up forever, and can't really deal with my issues while using.

Things have been shit for me recently. The best hook i ever had, my best friend, and one of the coolest mother fucking people i have ever met went to prison. I still can't believe i was able to get grams for 90$ in town. Just nuts. Not only that, but because he was on the run and i was driving him around all the time i got at least a half gram everyday for free. I miss him a lot and idk if i will ever see him again, but i have faith i will. I guess i made a good enough impression on him to have one of his good friends who just got done with his bid and treatment to just show up at my door fronting me drugs. I had never even met the guy. This town is fucking weird. 

Been going hard as fucking booting tar and meth pretty much everyday. Getting more fucked up then i ever have haha.

Considering the drastic measure of switching to methadone (something I said I would never do),"About 3.5 years ago, after a 9-10 month h relapse after a year totally clean, I started on a Suboxone program that seemed to really change my life. I was motivated, I got back in shape (I'm a scrawny son of a bitch with a physically demanding job), got my girl back and for once, I don't feel like I was a drug addict nor did I feel like I was ""in recovery"". I really do find that the hardest part about being a drug addict is the amount of time and energy are required to either keep your habit or keep clean. Either all in with a full time addiction or all in with recovery... Meetings, gym, reading the bullshit recovery books, talking recovery with other scab pickers after meetings etc. Suboxone took all that away, and for once, I could just forget about my addiction. I became just a regular guy that took a pill a day and that was that.

Fast forward 2 years and I am depressed, lethargic, uninterested in everything and basically just a piece of shit sitting on the couch waiting to go to work, or whatever. My partner was quietly encouraging me to quit subs and give sobriety another try. Never forceful, but she just wanted me happy and engaged in something... Anything. At this point, we were living in a small northern bc city where my partner was going to uni, and using was not an option. I wasn't even going to entertain the idea of trying to find dope in that miserable shithole. 

March of last year, we move back to the big city of Vancouver and quickly, with in a few months, start skipping days with my subs to get high. Then I'd skip 2, then 3, then.... I got back on dope. My plan was to use daily for about a month, then switch back to subs and do a quick taper. No problem right? Wrong! Like I said earlier, I work a very demanding job, and as our busy season approached, taking a few days off or working at anything less than 100% was not an option. I had to keep using. 

As work slowed down, I started making attempts at getting back on the subs but would  never make it more than a few days before I'd get back on dope. The depression was crippling, I have back pain and absolutely obsessive thoughts about using, even when on subs. After a dozen or so failures, I finally decided to get in touch with my old clinic and they are going to bring me back in tomorrow. 

I'm scared that I'm going to relapse again and I just don't want to. I won't bore you with anymore irrelevant details aside from I really cannot afford to be on dope 1 more day. I'm smoking at least a gram a day right now and hardly working... It's totally unsustainable. My question is, given my failure to get back on subs and have them be effective like they used to be, should I see if they will let me give methadone a try? At this point in my addiction, I need to do something different. Maybe a full agonist is what I need right now to get my life back in order. I don't think subs are going to do it this time. 

Sorry for the novel. If you read all of this, way to go!

I wonder whether tapperings is needed or beneficial after a weekend binge. 


This is the  scenario:


FRIDAY AFTERNOON:

Nasal Spray @ 2mg per spray. 

4 sprays @ 6pm

6 sprays @ 7pm

6 sprays @ 9pm 

6 sprays @ 10pm

Total = 45mg approximately. 

Results were quite satisfactory. One week since previous use. Dosed DXM an hour before the first U4 dose. Nodded deliciously from 9pm till midnight, when I passed out. 


SATURDAY NOON:

Nasal Spray @ 2mg per spray. 

5 sprays @ 1pm

6 sprays @ 4pm

6 sprays @ 6pm 

6 sprays @ 8pm

4 sprays @ 10pm

5 sprays @ 12pm

4 sprays @ 1am

6 sprays @ 2am

Total = 92mg approximately. 

Results were a bit less satisfactory, still very active but not as rushy as the day before, still quite pleasurable. These doses were under DXM as well (normal therapeutic dose). 


I must mention the nasal route is quite rushy, with a fast onset and a kick, but its ""easy come easy go"" nature makes this route quite bingy.  I experienced ZERO cravings during the binge, it is just too easy to indulge, but the restrain is a matter of focusing on something else. I truly felt like a boy discovering masturbation this weekend, just wanting to do it over and over, out of not having anything else to do. 

Orally the doses are easier to keep track of, the onset is gradual and the high longer lasting. It lacks the kick but it has longer legs and still is around 80% as euphoric. Also the secondary non-euphoric effects (comfortable numbness) last longer orally, making restraining oneself from redosing easier. 



Anyway,  **THE QUESTION IS:**

Today (Sunday) I woke up feeling buzzed and comfy, no withdrawals, pain, nor hungover, only slowed down. 
I wonder if I should dose a small dose today (15mg oral) in order to tapper off from the weekend. 


Does it make sense? Or are tappers only for long term dependency?  


I found it to feel so good this morning after my binge, so I thought the  withdrawals may come with a delay tomorrow at work, thus the idea to slow down the ""crash"" with a small dose today.

.

Now, all of us, whether you're a new addict, or you've been using for decades, know that withdrawal is a horrible horrible painful thing. Probably the worst part of any addiction. Yet as much as we hate it, it's important to be prepared.

.

I've seen people post their WD kits before. So what's in yours?
I'll go first:



.


My WD kit is an old Jurassic Park lunch box. Contained within are some thing to either get rid of, or help ease WD symptoms.


First of all I've got some downers. 6 xanax, 10 k-pins, 2 old ass Valium. The worst part of WD to me is not being able to sleep, and the dreaded RLS. Benzos/barbs seem to be the only thing that can help me sleep while in WD (besides actual opiates, obviously).


.

Next, I've got 80 Kratom extract capsules. This stuff works great, takes away 90% of WD symptoms for me, but I have to take like 12 or more to have these effects. Good stuff.

.

I've always got a bottle of lope. Apparently it works great for some people. It's never worked for me, even in massive doses of 200mg or more. But I keep it just in case, I guess. 

.

After that I've got 5 8mg suboxone strips. Maybe this one is cheating because it's an opioid. But I really love subs. They completely take away my opiate WD 100%, and if I take more than 10mg I even get high and start to nod. I would actually take these recreationally, but I never see them anymore, so they are too pricey. An essential part of a WD kit though IMO!


.

Next I've got a little pull bottle with about 12 5mg hydrocodones, and like 10 codeine of several different MG. shits too weak to get high off of, but definitely will help my WD's. These pills are like 3 years old lol.


.

I've got like 3 pre rolled joints with some really great medical pot, but I'm sure they're pretty dry since they've been in this box for over a year. Honestly pot tends to make my WD worse...but it's nice to have if I need it.


.

I've got a few bath bombs, I love soaking in the tub to try to relax my nerves when in WD. I also keep like $60 in here so I can treat myself with candy, a movie, whatever.


.


Well, that's pretty much it! This box is a lifesaver, seriously. I don't WD often because I keep like 80 pounds of poppy seeds under my bed. But when I do WD, I WD badly because of my tolerance. If I didn't have this box, I probably would have been close to losing my job a few times....




.


So again, what's in your WD kit/box? Am I missing something that you'd recommend? Thoughts? 



.

Tolerance breaks are fucking awesome! (Also an update on my situation if anyone cares),"I made my first post in this sub a few days ago about my situation just to vent and get some support. 13 days ago I went to my uncles place some ~4 hours from my hometown to get away from it all after having some rough shit go down with my parents. Long story short they found out that I hade stolen stuff from them to maintain my habit, when they thought I had gotten clean. I mentioned my super dumb idea to get a ""last"" bag before possibly going to rehab.

What went down since that is I got back home yesterday and got picked up at the train station by my dad making copping impossible. But at that point I had pretty much decided that I was going to honestly try to stay clean, so I didn't really think about it. What occupied my mind however was the upcoming meeting with social services that we were going to straight from the train station. We went to the meeting and explained the current situation (I had already been there when my habit first got out so this was sort of a follow-up). Both me and my dad basically demanded getting me to some kind of treatment home/rehab/whatever (this is not the us but northern europe so things are a bit different here). We were informed that they needed to have a few more meetings with me and investigate the matter further before being able to grant me that kind of treatment. The social welfare in my country is really good but the social workers are working waaay over their capacity so in conjuction with bureaucracy things tend to run really slow. So I'm going to another meeting tomorrow and one on thursday.

The deal I have with my parents now is that I'm allowed to eat and sleep at their apartment but when no one's home I'm not allowed to be there, reasonably considering the shit I've done. So now that they're at work I'm at the university trying to find out what I can do to finish the courses I fucked up last term.

I was honestly going to try to just go here, keep busy and stay sober, but I completely unexpectedly got ahold of some money. Naturally, my first instict was to call my dboy whose number I have memorized and go cop.

I'm almost not even upset about because DAMN! After 12 days clean, my tolerance is really low and fucking jesus hitler christ on a stick this shit was good! I sniffed a line the size of which wouldn't have even gotten me well two weeks ago, I was debating whether I should add some more but I rememberd harm reduction and thought I'd just do a test line.

Fuck me in the ass it feels good to get high after a tolerance break! When the rush hit me, I felt my manparts starting to tingle, something which has NEVER happened. My sex drive has been stupid low this past year due to H and being on sertraline, but now I got fucking rock hard when the first wave hit, and I stayes hard for like a solid half hour before it subsided. I've read that it happens to people occasionally but that mainly seems to happen to IV users, and I always thought that those people had a naturally high sex drive.

Anyway, I'm high and just felt like sharing and update on my situation if anyone is interested. As expected I didn't stay clean and I don't know how long this run will be but hopefully I'll be able to get to some kind of rehab and be able to work with my issues (major depression since before my addiction, which naturally has only been exacerbated by my usage and all the shame and guilt and self-hatred from fucking up my relationship with my ex and all the pain I've caused my parents).

Anyway, thanks to anyone who cares to read this. And a big thank you to everyone who commented on my last post, I never got around to answering everyone and I probably won't, but it is all greatly appreciated!

Hope everyone's feeling good tonight and staying safe. I'm feeling quite well myself: I've had a very pleasantly eventful night sitting here, vegging out on the interwebs - I am currently stable on my Suboxone dose, a nice shot of shards, some good weed, and a dose of phenibut.  

I just wanted to share an anecdote and a little tip with you guys that I've yet to see mentioned on here that could save somebody's life. I did some quick Googling to confirm that my case wasn't the only one in the world before I posted here [to avoid looking like a dumbass] and, I saw that on other forums, like BL and DF, a fair amount of people came and reported success with cases similar to mine. My idea wasn't so far-fetched after all!

*..speed rambles, full speed ahead..*

**The Story**

So, me and my girlfriend know this girl that we are pretty good friends with. She pretty much ODs EVERY single time she does dope because she doesn't really do it (she prefers tweak), plus she's like manic depressive/bipolar, so maybe she has a fuckin' death wish or something, I don't know forreal, but, every time we've gotten high with this chick, she ends up falling out. It's sad, stressful, and frustrating. 

Around July last year, when her boyfriend wound up in jail, my girl and I decided to let her stay with us for awhile. Me and my chick had a pretty decent sized dope habit and we were getting some pretty fire shit at the time. In fact, when I first started getting dope off my dude at the time, even I ended up dying a few times too. Still got like 2k in hospital bills to pay for getting 'canned the one time because the people I was with panicked. 

So yeeh, you get the idea, shit is stupid dumb flame, we warn her (maybe she doesn't listen or legit just doesn't know how much she can handle), etc., she shoots up, she gets high, and whatta ya know, she dies.

**OK**.  *Boom*. 

My shot is interrupted as alarms began going off in my head as I gear up into overdrive. I stop what I'm doing, put my gear down and start focusing on the now very real issue at hand.

Unfortunately I'm no stranger when it comes to dealing with overdoses. I'm not sure how many times I've found myself in an overdose situation, but I've legit lost count: I'd say upwards of 12-15 though. If you're using with me, you're likely in good hands. My girlfriend is also epileptic too and has seizures regularly, so I guess you can say I'm just used to being in emergency situations. 

I start by giving our friend rescue breaths like I always do. This was like, her 3rd day at my house and she was super depressed and unmotivated because of the whole thing with her dude in jail: her hygiene was lacking and her breath was so foul I can only describe it as the scent of a vagina I would have rather not smelled. After the first few series of breaths, she goes into an brief episode with her eyes open, staring blankly ahead while making a snoring sound as I was doing the breathing for her. Lightweight scary phenomenon to witness. 

Well, I had managed to keep our friend alive for over an hour with rescue breaths and shit like that, but she really wasn't making any significant improvements on coming to and was seemingly losing more and more color. In a large majority of the situations I've been in, most people would have likely come back by now or at least started breathing somewhat manually.

I was starting to panic: my girl had a warrant, my house is a known drug house, I'm a felon, and I already lost one homie here in 2013. 

(I know I told you were in good hands if you were using with me, but he passed while we were both asleep, may God rest his soul. At least 21mg Klonopin, alcohol, heroin, AND having gave blood earlier that day to get beer money.. he was a pretty big fucking dude -confident he could handle his drugs, everything was fine when we went to bed.. but I woke up to a lifeless body on my couch.. that's a story for another day though)  

So with that said, I try not to fuck with 911/cops unless I absolutely HAVE to, to minimize the heat on myself. (perhaps I'm a little selfish?)

In a moment of desperation and junkie ingenuity, I remember that I had about 2mg of Subutex already drawn up and ready to go in a spare rig that I had ducked away for an emergency sick day. I'm no stranger to precipitating withdrawal in myself, so I was praying for my theory to work. I thought back to the first time I experienced PWDs, I felt something I could only describe as an ""anti-rush."" Even now, I still vividly remember/imagine the feeling I felt of any lingering opiate being torn from my receptors, going from acute withdrawal to highly-severe withdrawal within mere seconds flat and liquid coming out of both ends within 10 minutes.

With this idea and buprenorphine's mechanism of action in mind, I was feeling pretty good that this would work.  

Now, ole girl is lightweight paranoid about sharing rigs and everything, but neither of us are infected with any sort of inner body karate (HIV/AIDS/Hep [both my girl & I tested clean in Oct. 2015]), so I didn't feel much remorse about sticking her with my needle and making her my blood sibling. Prior to meeting my current girlfriend, we had fooled around with each other, so it's not like we were strangers of any sort.

And.. bingo.

Within minutes of the injection she began to stir, slowly began breathing, and eventually regained consciousness: all within 10 mins *tops*, or even less. It was fairly quick and that's even taking into account the major time dilation I was experiencing. We told her what had happened and what was done, and that it was my last ditch effort before I finally fuckin' bit the bullet and called 911. There was no sign of her getting better whatsoever until I pulled this fuckin' Hail Mary play out of my ass. Thank God for being a somewhat resourceful junkie.

Ole girl wasn't even mad about it. She understood I did what had to be done. She didn't get noticeably bad PWDs or anything (I assume because she was not opiate dependent), however she never liked the way bupe made her feel, so one could assume she was feeling a little shitty for the night, but hey.. in the end, I guess it's better to live to see another morning than to punch out early, ?

Nowadays, this girl has been clean off of opiates since this experience in July and she is like 4 months pregnant with my other dude's kid. So, saving her life has resulted in her bringing new life into the world. \*sniff\* \*sniff\* It's beautiful, man. 

So, tonight, being tweaked on the internet browsing Reddit, I decided to use Google to see if I could find any sort of truth to this. I found several threads detailing cases similar to mine in which administration of bupe reversed a case of an opioid overdose, through IV, IM, even sublingually, and feel like what happened to me was in fact not just a fluke: but possibly a legitimate way to reverse an overdose without making too much of a commotion, getting any authorities involved and without access to any real Narcan!

So, if you're gettin' high with a pal and you find yourself in an overdose situation and the victim is seemingly making no improvements on coming to: if you happen to have ANY kind of bupe on hand, administer that fuckin shit and you just might fuck around and save a life. 

For harm reduction purposes, I would like to add this: after administering the buprenorphine, you may want to prepare to take the victim to the hospital, if for some reason your attempt is futile: move them to a vehicle and get them ready to be transported, just in case, ya know? 

But from my experience - and what I've read from others - a person should be come to within 15-20 minutes tops. (this is w/ sublingual ROA: I recommend IV administration for seemingly almost instantaneous effects)

I figured this would be worth sharing with ya'll, because I did a ""site:reddit.com suboxone reverse overdose"" and found 2 or 3 threads that briefly mentioned something about it, but this doesn't seem to be very common knowledge. Some people may only have a slight theory that this might work, but just so you know, anecdotal evidence is out there and available for you to find.

I hope that by making this information available on here, that somebody will read this, understand me, think I'm a genius and, by turn of unfortunate events, find themselves in a situation where it's looking kinda grave for the overdosee and they are able to save someone else's life one day with a muhfuggin' Suboxone, *skrait* up. Who'da thunk it?

God bless, nothin less,

Unk

200mg oral 2.75 hrs later, another 200mg, 2.75 hrs later another 200mg

2.75 hrs later drop down to 175mg, repeat for two more doses.

Thursday started with my parents driving me to my PHP program because they wanted to speak to my doctor about my suicidality. The doctor called the cops to take me to the local crisis center to be evaluated for inpatient psych. 

The crisis center decided that I did not meet criteria and booted me out the door. I called my parents to come get me. They told me I could eat dinner with them but could not stay. They kicked me out. 

I went directly to my dboy to get whatever I could to try to OD. Turns out he gave me straight fent powder, white and snowy. My mom called me, saying to come home and we would find somewhere for me to stay together. I told her I would be home in fifteen minutes.

I pulled over and shot two bags. My usual dose of actual dope is four to five bags, and I knew immediately that this was abnormal. But it did the job. I started to drive away once the rush wore off, and that's when I passed out. I hit a car from behind, swerved, hit a telephone pole, went up on two wheels, then did a 180 and finally stopped. 

Apparently someone driving by was an emt and called the cops while pulling me, dead, out of my car and giving me cpr. I woke up after the cops shot me with narcan on the side of the road. I was arrested for possession, a dwi, reckless and careless driving on the way to the ER. 

I lost my home, my car, my family, almost my life, my clean record, everything all in the course of eight hours. I have now been in the ER for five days waiting for a psych hospital to admit me involuntarily. 

I don't think it's going to help any, being in a hospital. I've been in three treatment centers before and just got out of the last one last Friday. I don't want to live anymore. They say it gets better. It doesn't get better for me, it just gets worse. 

Don't be me. Call me a cautionary tale. Hopefully I can get out of the hospital soon and actually finish this forever.",1457397330.0

With alcohol, benzos and Zdrugs, you can black out and do real stupid, even violent things. With opiates your more chill and dont feel like getting aggressive. 

Also with GABAergics you can die from the withdrawals. At least with opiates you may be sick as a dog and it can feel unbearable, but you will make it through and wont have seizures and die. 
I seen an alcoholic die in a detox center and it was so disturbing and sad. I also had seizures from alcohol withdrawal and the risk of me relapsing on alcohol or GABAergics is 0 because just the memorys scare the shit out of me

Always wanted to try it, and it was on the short list of drugs I hadn't tried. Bought a point of white af powder, (ecp?,fent?) 

After snorting a small alergy dot, i sniffed a quarter of what I had purchased.  The rest of the evening basically consisted of me rolling around in my sheets listening to chill tunes and loving life, aside from the occasion  trips to the toilet to throw up, which was nothing but a mild inconvenience at the time.

 Last week I took more Xanax then I usually do and woke up to a few emails containing tracking numbers for 100 syringes and U-47700.

 I cut out of work at lunch today because I knew the syringes were waiting in my mailbox. On my way home (20 minutes in the opposite direction) I stopped off at my dudes trap and grabbed a half gram of girll..

 I got in from out of town last night knowing the u47 was waiting, I did some preliminary research last night, enjoying it up the nose and on foil (mostly smoked, as it seemed to hit me quicker) fun rc so far, I typically avoid drugs you can easily OD on due to my inability to not overdo whatever substance is in front of me. 

Anyways.. I am currently about it 30 minutes from my last shot of u47, small shots of coke every so often, I'm like a kid in a candy factory fuck, I always knew I would be good at and enjoy shooting.. I have gigantic veins, and have always sorta romanticized the process of getting high, whether it be packing a bowl, loading a stem, racking lines etc.. and have understood the metrics of how to shoot for a long time, mostly from lurking around you fine folks.. Have even had a using dream where I shot up, which I had never done. 

No real point to this but to share my experience I suppose, would love to hear about other who never feared the needle and didn't avoid it at all like most seem to..

I'm, going to have a bunch of these 29 gauge half inch insulin pokers left once I run out of the u47, would it be weird to walk downtown and offer clean rigs to the beggers/ homeless?

  Pre response to replies warning me, Either about ODin' from shooting with 0 tolly, or getting hooked on needle forever. Don't bother. I know myself well enough to to know it's not likely going to be the thing that ruins my life, and if it is I'm more than ok accepting the choices I make.

Edit/update: Speedballs are cool, but i think I'm going to keep my needle fetish away from opiates, I never use opiates to the point of dependence for obvious reasons (i have dabbled with various opi pills for a decade or so, there are a few drugs I'll try to buy before accepting I'll just get high on opiates) and without a suitable tolerance I'm more than a little nervous about dosing IV, making it less enjoyable as opposed to coke or shards.

Anyone ever been legitimately hacked before? Shiiit, after using computers like errreday since 1998 I finally got my shit fucked up! My record was so clean too! If you've played any MMORPG or have a Facebook account then you definitely know someone whose been a victim of a keylogger / had their password brute forced / ""hacking"" (actual or the ol forgot to log out ""hack"" trick, lol). Never downloaded ANY type of sketchy ANYTHING, logged into personal accounts outside of my own personal secure electronics, don't have the same password for anything as well as them being mawfuckin impossible to guess, etc, so legitimately got hacked.


Facebook notified me a few days ago that there was some recent sketchy activity. 1) My account being logged into from a I.P. address in China + 2) Attempts to use my Facebook and my connected phone number (lol never in a million years would I connect a cell number to my public Facebook) to purchase a shit ton of game gift cards and other shit. So yeah, really surprising as no one but myself knows any of my account informations, I know how to securely use consumer electronics + the internet machine and I only travel to China to have unprotected bareback sex with ladyboys and to masturbate elephants, (another story for another time), certainly not to log into Facebook and buy shit tons of gift cards with fake/stolen CC info lol.


So yeah, low and behold any account of mine that I logged into on my personal PC (which is the only place I log into these things, op security yo!)- which has never left my house or logged into any other internet than the one we pay for- seems to be unsafe. Besides AIDSBook, Amazon, Netflix, some other faggy nerdy selling websites and pony three email account I look to be okay. OH YEAH, BESIDES MY 10+ ACCOUNTS FOR THE MMORPGS: Star Wars The Old Republic and Path Of Exiles. The accounts that exist for the sole purpose of making me money. The accounts I've spent thousands of hours on in the past two years. The accounts that were responsible for about $400 a week for said years. THE ACCOUNTS THAT HAD AT LEAST $5000 IN UNSOLD E-GOODS ON THEM. THE ACCOUNTS WHICH WERE DEFINITELY THE REASON SOME CHINKY CHINA CHINK HACKED MY ELEPHANT JERKING OFF ASS! ARRRGGGHH!!!--


So yeah! Never thought I'd see this day. Spent my whole life being careful as shit with my internet security. Never believing when reading sob stories of people who magically got ""hacked"" who DEFINITELY weren't downloading cheating software, visiting Voldermort-esque tainted websites or sharing their accounts. Well shit! I'm now a believer, haha. Before this I never believed that people spontaneously got their shit hacked just because the wrong nerd knew that you had some amazing shit in your stash. 



I've been selling video game items/currencies for the last 10+ years so I've dealt with a good amount of other people in the industry, whether they were buying for personal use, buying to resell to some schmucks, American middlemen for big-time Chinese wholesalers, members of the games team trying to set people like me up just so they could delete our amassed stash of MMORPG gold so they could whack off their shining whiteknight woodies later on, etc, I've seen the whole side of this business. Shit I've been friends with a few ""hackers"" myself, but no matter what they said they did, I knew they got their personally stolen accounts with keyloggers, because that's just how it works. 



But yeah, I'm finally a fucking believer, you CAN get your shit hacked no matter what you do or do not or do. But it is rare as fuck, that's for damn sure. If I can offer any advice for potential assholes like me who have a chance to capitalize on vidya e-currency, be careful who you chum with! I'd bet anything- my elephant photo collection, my dozen Michael Jordan shaped buttplugs, my ever dwindling stash of black lol- that it was one of the Chinese resellers that I dealt with for PoE orbs who is behind all this. There have been rumors and accusations all over the community for years that he's behind shit like what happened to me all the time, that he's nothing more than a thug. A literal internet gangster, lol. Gold Farm slum dog-eating millionaire. An asshole who supposedly makes his own fucking family farm/middle currencies for him to support their habits, video or vice alike, regardless of he fact he could just pay for them due to his huge network of slaves, sellers, buyers and whatever the fuck else sketchiness he's involved in. I'm ranting and raving lol, but this guy is definitely behind it. I got about $200 a week from him alone and in the past we've done a couple deals over $500, $600+. That's a fuckton of money to get off a shark like him, his rates are shitty as fuck since he makes the bulk of his moolah off lazy Americans like me lol, his profit margins are as great as you'd imagine, so he knew that at any given time I'd have a lot of shit he'd love to get his little yellow hands on.



Holy fuck this is some shit guys and gals. This gravy train is coming to a complete fucking halt.... wayyyy too much starch, that's for sure lol. To top it all off? I'm almost out of black! Sad story, huh?? Poooor little fucking baby girl Jeff Spicoli!! Hahaha sorry for the novel, just had to share this with someone. My friends I'm pretty sure hate whenever I bring up this nerdy shit of mine, always getting those glazed over looks in their eyes lol. Take care boys and girls and get high as fuck today for old Jeffy!

Stamps are thicker, dope is good--a little better than what I was getting before, and he gets his ""commission"" from his dboy, so I get a full ten stamp bundle for the same price I was paying previously for 8 stamps with a smaller amount of shittier dope. And he seemed like a decent guy, chatted up a little while we were waiting in my car, and was very patient with me when I got lost on the way there, etc

&nbsp;

Awesome, right? 

&nbsp;

Except he only bothers with bundles. So while I only needed a couple of stamps, it wasn't worth it to him (or to me, economically with the 1.75 hour round trip) so I did a bun. And I wasn't very good at stretching that shit out like I told myself I would. 

&nbsp;

So now I'm wanting to dabble...but with him (my only viable connect right now and no open air markets anywhere near me) it's a bun or none. If I pick up with him, I'll be a fucking addict by the end of the week, and that's a road I can't go down again. 

&nbsp;

I wish he'd turned out to be a dick...that his dope was garbage, full of fillers and the stamps were stingy. Actually, I kinda wished he'd taken my money and just bounced, in a way. Because this is fucking tempting, and I'm really trying to be a good girl.

Yeah, this is a shit post...not really sure what I'm looking for here...advice, commiseration, support...

I work so much these days, that I have no energy when I'm off work, so I like to relax. Once I've got my opiate of choice in my system, I either watch Netflix, or play video games!


.

I've got some old school systems, n64, ps1, ps2, Snes, etc for when I need a dose of nostalgia (Hotwheels racing anyone...?) I also have an original 1982 Miss PACMAN arcade cabinet that my father gave me once I graduated college. None of you fuckers will EVER beat me at miss PACMAN, I'll tell you that right now! :)

.

Ive got some newer systems, WiiU for Mario Kart and smash brothers. 3DS XL for animal crossing, and such.

.

But I JUST ordered a ps4 on Amazon today. I'm super pumped because it's a limited edition Destiny ps4. I've never even played that game, but I loved the look of the console. Here's a link:

Isn't that great?? I'm so excited for it to get here! I got an order from Darknet too so I'll be waiting for the FedEx dude like crazy.

.

Any recommendations for the ps4 or WiiU? I've already got GTA5 coming from eBay, but I need more ideas.

Oh! Also, how could I forget? MOTHER FUCKING RUNESCAPE! I've been playing on the same account on Runescape for over 12 years now. Everyone else stopped playing in 5th grade, but I never really did. I swear, that game is my first real experience with addiction.

I have struggled with a DA for a while and this dream was a massive epiphany. I remember this dream very vividly. I was at the top floor of a skyscraper in NYC with my family and my two best friends. I had a pill bottle in my pocket as well. There was a giant tidal wave coming towards the city (see Day After Tomorrow). I remember specifically holding the pill bottle tightly and not worrying about my family or friends at all. As the wave hit, we all started moving down the floors while the water pushed us. I kept holding on strong. I ended up on a floor where there was little water and the first thing I did was open the bottle, to make sure there was no damage to any of the medication. After doing so, I looked around, and I was alone. My family and friends were gone.",1457537405.0

I call up my boss and tell her what happened and let her know I won't be able to make it in for a few days and what happens? Does she ask if I'm alright? Nah. Tell me no worries, keep her in touch? Naaaaaah. She fires me. STRAIGHT UP fires my ass. 

Was I the greatest employee? Probably not but daaaamn fire a dude? Way to kick me when I'm done, girl. Thanks!

Every other time they cut me loose at the jail because I was a heroin addict and they didn't have room in medical for misdemeanors.

Anyway, not so lucky this time. I figured Id get PRd in the morning because my charge was baby stuff. Nope. Judge decided that he might not see me again since I had been avoiding the warrant for so long already.

So all day Im trying to bail out because my bail is like $100 but I didnt have any numbers to call or anything, so Im basically fucked and the sick is coming on strong.

I eventually just accepted my fate and began the process. I didnt eat anything the whole time I was there because the food was shit.

So finally, I get my court date and the judge gives me a day of jail and some fines. They say Ill be out in about 2-6 hours. Sweet, I think, I can catch the bus back to my car. Fast forward about 12 hours. Finally I get released... No hope of catching the bus or getting a ride, so I start the walk.

At about the ten mile mark I finally get someone to stop and give me a ride. I really didnt think it would happen that late at night.

I'm not just being a dick here (but I kinda am), I started eating amphetamines on a regular basis so I wouldn't nod at work, and for job security, and cuz shooting them is way too much fun but tolerance goes up like crazy (law of diminishing returns).

When I'm on uppers my giant veins hide inside my body, but only until I hit, then they pop right out again. Shit is totally backwards! So lately I've been hitting, then taking a hot shower or bath, and then I outline my veins in marker with tiny dots so I can hit them without having to find them!

I've discovered veins I didn't even know I had (it helps if you tie off), now I've got like 8 spots on rotation and they're all looking pretty good (I usually do 2 or 3 shots a day on weekdays).

I grew up with an addict father. Now at a four year college, and I'm doing a class project on addiction, specifically the idea of death in the minds of addicts.  I'd like to collect personal narratives of addicts, so you could include anything you'd like in telling me your story. I'd also have some specific questions that I'd ask, but you could choose whether or not you'd like to answer. Still working on a list, but I might ask you about if you know anyone who has died because of drug use, if you ever see yourself getting clean, if you think your drug use will play a role in your death, and if you do think about death in the context of your drug use, how so?

I understand this is an incredibly sensitive topic, so if you do agree, you could back out at any time. I want you to know I'm doing this because I believe it humanizes addicts, something that I believe desperately needs to happen.

I will cross-post this thread in relevant subs, please feel free to participate in all of them as you see fit (you never know how a person in need of information will find them). 

First I want to thank /u/Exin for the summary I will share below, and at the same time I want to share my heartfelt condolences for his loss to -most likely- [the lethal combination of Opioids and Benzodiazepines](https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/49pi2h/girlfriend_overdosed_on_u47700_earlier_this_week/)


**TL:DR WHEREAS ALCOHOL AND BENZOS ARE EXTREMELY POPULAR DRUGS TO MIX WITH ALL THE OTHER DRUGS, TO POTENTIATE OR MELLOW THEM, BOTH ALCOHOL AND BENZOS ARE LETHAL IF MIXED WITH OPIATES**

*THERE ARE WAYS OF MIXING BENZOS AND OPIOIDS, BUT IT IS A VERY DELICATE TASK TO BE SUPERVISED BY A PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL PRACTITIONER, AND HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE USUAL INDULGENCE POLYDRUG USERS TEND TO HAVE WHEN DOSING**

If you have access to both Opioids and Benzos, I beg you to pledge to restrict your use of them in the presence of the other. Benzos can be very tricky and allow you to forget you have already taken a dose -or two-, making it very easy to overdose during their hypnotic effects. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Having worded a warning that must already be the Shibboleth of every Opioid user, lets delve into **POTENTIATORS THAT WON'T KILL YOU** -as easily- (keep in mind you will have to adjust your usual Opioid dosages on the lower side, because well... these substances POTENTIATE). 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

When I asked /r/Exin about how he -reportedly- successfully potentiated U4, this is what he told me:

**From what I know, 30mg of DXM is perfectly fine for tolerance reduction.**

**The regiment my gf and I figured out is pretty extensive but it was basically:**

**~30mg of Dextromethorphan for tolerance reduction and potentiation [30 minutes before]**

**25-50mg of Diphenhydramine (benadryl) for potentiation + nausea reduction [30 minutes before]**

**600mg of cimetidine (tagamet) for potentiation (SUPER POWERFUL) [45 minutes before]**

**~8oz of grapefruit juice for potentiation (my gf hated grapefruit juice and wouldn't take it, but I love it and I did) [45 minutes before]**

**500mg of magnesium for potentiation, makes opiates last longer [30 minutes before]**

**~8oz of Tonic water for the quinine if you really want to try to milk every last bit of potentiation, but I just hated tonic water [30 minutes before]**

**I think that was it. We did a TON of research on everything, she had a bachelors degree in a healthcare field, we knew our shit. Honestly cimetidine and grapefruit juice are the most powerful for potentiation purposes. Just taking cimetidine makes a huge improvement in euphoria and length of the high.**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example of a warning about potentiators:

  ""Cimetidine is also known to potentiate the effects of several opiods which are partially metabolized via the cytochrome P450 pathway via inhibiting their metabolism and a temporary decrease of liver function due to reduced hepatic blood flow. This can lead to extreme plasma levels of these drugs and can easily lead to a fatal overdose.[18]

It is also important to recognize that cimetidine can interact with a number of different psychoactive medications, including those in the classes of Tricyclic Antidepressants and Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors, causing increased blood levels of these drugs and subsequent toxicity.""

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cimetidine

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Consider that reducing the intake of Opioids when potentiating them will still be safer than ""potentiating"" Opioids with reckless ammounts of Benzodiazepines.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------


The potentiators above work in different ways, DXM for example prevents tolerance from forming as fast at the time of reducing previous tolerance when dosed concomitantly with all Opioids; other potentiators such as Grapefruit and Cimetidine work -reportedly- with U4 and *some* other Opioids by disabling enzymes in the liver responsible for degrading the Opioids into inactive metabolites, but at the same time these very enzymes will be responsible for metabolizing **other Opioids** from inactive substances into active metabolites. 

So yeah, the recipe above should work with U4, assuming the enzymes de-activated by Grapefruit and Cimetidine are responsible for deactivating U4, if that is the case then the potency and length of effects would be potentiated. 

Other Opioids like Codeine do need the enzymes to be activated or even **induced** in order to be metabolized  into Morphine -in the case of Codeine- or other active metabolite. In these cases using Cimetidine or Grapefruit would inhibit the desired effects of Codeine instead of potentiating them.

Other Opioids that **need** to be metabolized in order to achieve desired effects include, but are not limited to:

Hydrocodone - metabolized into -Hydromorphone (a maximum yield of 25%)

Oxycodone - metabolized into - Oxymorphone (average yield of 15%)

Codeine - metabolized into - Morphine (average yield of 10%)


So, basically, some Opioids need the enzymes to metabolize them into active substances, other Opioids are already active but also metabolized into other active Opioids through these enzymes, other Opioids are inactive until they are metabolized, and other Opioids will be completely active before metabolization. 

In all of them, though, the enzymes are responsible for degrading them as time passes, so inhibiting said enzymes would make the effects last longer, and the concentrations in plasma to be higher. **hence the importance of titrating the Opioids with lower doses than usual when potentiating them**. 

Morphine would be an example of an Opioid that would benefit from the inhibition of the enzymes in question, because it is already active by itself, and metabolization de-activates it. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am barely mentioning Opioids that are not U-47700, only to exemplify the factors that are involved in potentiation and the importance of doing your own research depending on your substance, yet the bottom line is: **there are much better -less dangerous- ways to potentiate your Opioid than mixing it with benzos**. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

I would really appreciate if users with real experience could come and help this effort of education and harm reduction by telling us their **horror stories with Opioid+Benzo** and their successful stories with **Opioid Potentiation**. 

I am particularly interested on whether U-47700 potency is truly benefited from Cimetidine or Grapefruitjuice consumption, but a general discussion on Opioids is actually encouraged. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lets try to leave a collection of facts, anecdotes, suggestions, links, quotes, and whatever could help users enjoy the most of their drugs without putting themselves in terrible danger.

All in all it was good for me but it's backfired more then I expected by meeting people and addicts with similar mind sets. 

So long story short a good friend I met in sober living got kicked out and lost his job we were working together for a long time. Went into kleptomaniac phase of stealing tools from storage units and construction sites. 

Well when we needed money quick we restored to pawn stores for shit we had sitting around for a long time. After this went on for a few months my friend got caught up in storage complex with cops got away and was wanted for a few days. 

He really needs some money to get out of state takes some TVs to the pawn store and they say they can't do business with him anymore and call the cops when he leaves. He gets taken down by the swat team shortly after and gets interrogated by detectives for 5 hours. 

They show him this massive list of items he pawned and my name comes up and shows all this shit I had pawned. And that they have been investigating us for a few months. He gets on bail with 3 burglary charges of storage units and possession. This happened a month ago now. 

I still havnt been contacted by any law enforcement or by my storage unit complex where I have a unit stuffed with items from different places and after this happened to my friend my code doesn't work anymore but still havnt been contacted or even asked for rent in a month. 

My friend said I need to get an attorney ASAP but just don't have the money and terrified to see what's going to happened because nothing has yet and it's been a decent amount of time. 

I'm just venting to you guys and terrified what's going to happen and see if anyone's got any ideas which way to go. 

My last question is the common pawn store we go to which gives good deals a few days after my friend was busted I take my personal laptop in for a loan and get 120$ for it and was 100% planning on getting it out on my next check. But a few days after I took another item and they said they can't do business with me at any locations and wouldn't tell me why.   I honestly don't know what to do about my laptop because my Mom will freak if she figures out its gone and I don't know if the pawn store will let me buy it back if I go in or will just call the cops for all the shit that's gone down in my story above.

This is a throwaway but I assure you, I've been here for well over a year and you guys are my little peter in a sea of pubes*

This habit is killing me, mentally and financially. Everytime I get high, I start searching for outpatient sub clinics to kick the habit. Problem is, I've already tried it 2 times over the past 5 years. I always get down to 2mg's a day, and don't go any farther. 

The reason being is my back. 10 years ago i started having this horrible pain in my lower back which kept me from enjoying everything I loved. I couldnt fish, golf, fuck, and so on. Then I started buying percs from my cousin and I got my life back. 

Once I developed a habit, I decided it was time to go to the doctor and get my back fixed. The doctor put me on tramadol and gave me xrays and MRI's, but couldn't find anything serious and sent me to therapy. 3 days a week, for a year, i did every exercise and stretch imaginable, but to no avail, my pain never went away. I kept getting referred to other specialist, which never found anything, thus getting the idea I was just doc shopping. After being referred to pain management, and getting a monthly script of Lyrica because they wouldn't give me anything else, I did what everyone else here would do, go back to getting them off the street. 

Why, because it was easier. At that point, I just learned it was easier to self medicate. I would just fix my own damn issues, fuck doctors. All it did was push me farther away from real health professionals. They are the ones who put me in the place i am today. 

Once I got married, and had a kid, it got tough. I was hiding my habit from my wife. She knew I had issues with my back, but didn't know they were bad enough that was addicted to opiates to treat it. She would flip the fuck out and leave me if she knew. I tried to quit several times during out marriage but after 2 weeks to a month of being off the pills, the pain was unbearable. I couldn't work, play with my kid, do house chores, etc. 
It also caused my cold hearted bitch of an ex wife to leave me because I couldn't be a productive husband and pull my weight with the relationship. Shit like this made me get back on pills again. 

Years later and present day, I'm sitting here blogging on Reddit telling you guys how fucked up my life is, I have no social life, I have no money, I have crippling depression from being bipolar, and so on. I'm checking my insurance for another bupe doc so I can kick this shit because I'm up to 3 bags of boy a day. I'm gonna find out they don't take insurance for drug treatment (fucking bluecross blueshield). I'll end up going back to the ghetto bupe doc that just feeds people subs for cash and could give no shit about you quitting. 

I have come to realize, untill I can get a handle on my back problems, I'll never get off opiates. No matter how old I get, I will always love them. It's ruining my life because I have to have them to kill the pain so I can work and father my child. I couldn't tell you the last time I got high because I can only afford enough to keep from getting sick. 

Therefore, I'm hoping this new doc I'm making an appointment with tommorow will ween me back down to 2mgs of bupe a day and that will let me get a handle on things and start to rebuild my life again. 

Does anyone else have this issue. Wanting to get off, but they can't, physically i guess. You have to have it to be a productive member of society but taking it is ruining your life (money, social stigma, etc). I wrote a suicide note the other day and seriously thought about ending it but the picture of my son on the coffee table talked me out of it. I really hate my life. I want to blame everyone, but that wont get me anywhere. 

What is going to suck is when the doc's finally find out whats wrong with my back, they're just going to put me back on opiates, but at least my insurance will pay for them and I can start putting money in the bank again.

I doubt anyone read this shit, if you did, let me know if you have the same problem I do so I know I'm not the only pathetic person out there. What I mean, is that you have come to the conclusion that you will never be able to fully quit because of something or another (like back issues)",1457598320.0

Fire stuff, light tan to dark brown and it is fire. It is coming in wax bags. The problem is when I wake up in the morning the product in the bag changes from light tan/brown to almost pure white. And even worse the product goes from fire to absolute SHIT. I only sniff but instead of having a great drip/taste and getting high from it, there is absolute no taste no drip and it barely gets me well. in fact not even well just not super sick. What the fuck is going on though?!? Like why and how is this even happening.

And before anyone says it, no there isn't someone going through every one of my stamps while I sleep and cut/switch the stuff out, I live alone. I have tried different methods to store it, I'll keep it room temp, I will keep it in garage where it's colder, I'll keep it in air tight jar, I'll leave it out in the open etc it is still doing it. I told my guy he said no one else has ever said it to him and he recommended I try keeping it in rice. When I keep it in a bag tied right with rice I would say it is maybe a 1/3 chance that some of the bags don't degrade and stay raw while some turn into that white garbage. But even the rice method doesn't really work.

I need help about this bad fellow bropiates. I can't afford to buy stuff the night before for work and have it turn to shit/straight garbage and be sick for work not to mention the $. But yet I can't meet him before work as there is no way I can wake up two hours earlier then normal and anyway my plug wouldn't be up at 6-7 am anyway. 

So has this happened to anyone else ?? I just cannot believe this has happened. It really is upsetting spending so much to stock up on fire and having the fire turn into literal garbage. Any suggestions??",1457591627.0

First off;

I hope everyone is safe, not facing any court bullshit(and if you are... i hope it ends well and in your favor) and I hope no one is dope sick... and if you are, i hope you got it taken care of on your end and the man is in route.
On to the brain breaker: 

I am in a situation to where i am having to take drug tests.
It is always the over the counter/4 to 7 panel drug test.
Mainly, the person is looking for opiates in my system... and i have figured out how to beat the test for that.
.
The last test came up completely negative...
And now, that is the problem..

This persons knows I smoke weed and has been smoking with me too the past few days as well.

She sees the test and goes, ""what the fuck.  How come it is not positive weed... i smoked with you yesterday.... what did you take to pass this ect so forth, no trust. No trust. Blame. Hatefulness.  Hurt.  ""

So.... i need a drug test to pass for everything but weed?
I can get it to pass for eveeyrhing.... 

But how can i make a drug test just not pass for weed?!?!?
(I cannot use my urine because it will have opiates in my system for a few.more days)

So yeah.... SOLVE THIS RIDDLE, BROS AND SIS'S OF REDDIT OPIATES

Long story short, because my plug owed me, tonight I ended up with my usual tar and coke (I do speedballs quite a bit), but I also ended up with a bit of meth. And I do mean a little bit like maybe 0.05. I'm very experienced with speedballs but have only done meth (IV) one time and it was several months ago. 

So my question is, could I/should I load all three up and shoot it? I'm just wondering how (un)safe it is and also if the combo will have good synergy or if the meth would somehow take away from the usual awesomeness of the speedball. What should I do?

EDIT 1: I said GOD DAMN! That was a bad ass shot. I ended up shooting everything all at once in the same shot. It felt amazing. Pretty crazy combo. 

Edit 2: I don't understand why this post got downvoted, man. I was just trying to get some help. Ya know, information and suggestions about how to best enjoy your drugs and not die in the process. Which, I thought was the point of this sub. I've noticed on here lately that while this community can be super helpful and supportive, every post can go either way very easily. If the first couple comments aren't helpful, and they instead concentrate on the way you worded something  or some dumb ass joke or are just people generally being asses and fucking with people looking for help, the whole thread can turn into complete shit pretty quickly. I mean I get that it's the Internet and all. I've been doing this shit for a while now, and know enough that most likely I won't kill myself doing something stupid with these drugs. But some people really don't know anything and when they come here for help and instead just get fucked with, they're way more likely just to do some dumb ass shit because everyone on here was too busy making fun of their wording or forcing in a dumb ass joke about nipping or just saying ""BANG THAT SHIT"" or any other number of stupid shit people do and say on here. So while I understand it's the Internet and you have to take everything with a grain of salt, I think it's worth noting that this shit is dangerous and if people are seeking help and get fucked with instead it can have real world consequences because this isn't just a regular Internet situation.

But not quit. Maybe.","Hello my friends. I don't post a lot but I spend a lot of time here every day. So, it is getting to the point where I can't really get high any more. Started opiates in January 2014, Vics and Percs, then morphine and 8mg dillies. Dilaudid was physical addiction number one. Did a fast taper and then a slow taper with morphine. Basically painless except for the first time I let myself feel w/d. That was in August after a 6 month run. About a month of no opiates. Then I found blues. Used a mix of blues an Dilaudid, morphine to hold me over. I got sick a lot during this time, at the end was paying 40 for a blue. In august of 2015, I've switched to dope, still using dilaudids here and there. Have only ever snorted. Here, dope runs for 140-200 a g. I basically never get sick. I'm tired of this beast on my back. I love my new job and I keep being late because I'm picking up in the morning or on my lunch break. So I got a half today and did it all in like a 2 hour period and I'm still pretty high from it. Usually I'll get a half, do .2, and then do the other .2 slowly over the evening, and a .1 for the morning. I'm about to go out and get .25. Will be taking .05 when I wake up, when I go to bed, for the next two days starting tomorrow, then the last .05 3 mornings from now. I have a small stash of ER morphine beads, which I take 20-30 mg of orally every 12 hours after that, smaller and smaller each day. I probably have about 200 mg morphine. Lope for any breakthrough uncomfy. Weed. 1 adderall, 1 klonopin, 1 clonidine. I'm not really looking for advice, but I'm putting all this down for you all to read so I have another reason to actually follow through. I have a family vacation coming up in 2 weeks and I want this beast off my back. I was hoping to bring a small amount as a reward, not sure about that yet. I don't think I am quitting forever, at least not yet. I kind of hope I can do a kind of ""using"" taper, like I used to used multiple times a day every day, now you get high once a day every 4 days, once a week, every 10 days, once a month; etc. that is all. Sorry for the wall of text. :( side note: before any one says that they don't believe that people can go back to using something they once abused as hard as I have with opiates, I used to have a severe stimulant and benzo addiction prior in my life, and I am able to use those rarely and responsibly now.

The last few days I've been doing adderall and PST at the same time, increasing the PST since I can't feel it as much while on the adderall. I think I ended up taking too much because I was working on a project and then all the sudden I started feeling like I was losing control of my body, no nod or anything. I freaked out and dialed a friend ASAP and talked to them for a minute.. My heart started pounding so fast that I had a mini anxiety attack. My question is... since I don't know really how much of the opiates in PST that I've done, and it lasts so long, should I take another adderall to make sure I stay ""awake""? Should I go to the ER and chill in the parking lot? I know they have naloxone there. I've never even come close to ODing... I don't even like to nod. Is it possible to fall straight out without nodding first? I could understand that with IV use but this is tea.. no instant high.

I have limited experiences with opiates, went through a stint of using and abusing tramadol 2 years ago. In hindsight turns out it was always quite conservative dosages day to day but could get pleasurable effects from 150mg+  (I do feelthough that at the time I was probably getting the most relief out of the SNRI action). 
In the last six months I've had 3 experiencses with Oxycodone, each time 10mg solutions mixed with a drink. These felt like what I imagine is a very nice low dose, tingling itchiness, no nausea, carefree feeling and that opiate warmth. I feel like i could quite comfortably take 20mg no tolerance.


I'm wondering what would be a safe amount to try, which ROA would you suggest, or if 10mg would even be enough?

   It's strange. If you've been on Reddit long enough you can actually go through your post history and view how your addiction has progressed. Sort of like a journal. Look at yours, it's crazy to look at. 

   I started out like many of you, I'm sure my story is pretty similar to yours. Currently 21 years old, started at 18. I've always been an anxious/depressed person and of course had other painful life problems and discovered how well pills took away that emotional pain. I don't think I was ever physically addicted to pills, but after a year of pills I was introduced to heroin. Heroin made everything okay and a year later I had a gram a day tolerance. It wasn't fun anymore. It was never fun, but now I didn't care if I was alive. I wanted to die everyday. Heroin was the reason, but heroin kept me going. My life went to the lowest of lows and I was eventually found of an accidental OD in my room. Klonopin, alcohol, and dope. 

   One month from now will be the one year anniversary of that OD and when I went to rehab. I didn't want to go, I have no idea how I did it, but I did. I thought I was gonna be a junkie forever, but I'm not. I am currently on Suboxone, and I do use other drugs occasionally. Of course I'm still an ""addict"", but I'm doing a hell of a lot better than I was a year ago.  Everyday is a struggle, but somehow I keep going. These are my experiences and the things that have helped me. I'm just sharing this in hopes that I can help at least one person.

1. Rehab

   Rehab will help anyone if they truly want to be clean. I went to an intensive outpatient program 3 times a week for 3 months. I didn't want to go at first, thought it was all bullshit and ridiculous, but the more I went I realized those people are there to help and support you, and eventually I looked forward to actually doing something three times a week instead of being bored and doing nothing. (I strongly suggest people look at iop programs, specifically because you can work around those times, and they are usually a bit cheaper than inpatient. So you're not missing work, and you're not broke.) I learned a lot about myself in there.

2. Suboxone 

   I personally consider being on subs as being ""clean"". You may not. That's okay. Just like anyone with an illness, or a disease they take a medicine that helps the symptoms. That's what I imagine Suboxone is for. I hope one day I will be able to be completely off, but right now I'm doing okay being on them. It's my choice, and my quality of life has gone up tremendously. I'm not sick, broke, missing work. I have better relationships, I'm not stealing or pawning, I'm not lying, and I mean... I'm about to buy a car so I feel like I'm doing pretty well. I'd say subs help tremendously with helping me stay ""clean"". I still have cravings, and I have relapsed a few times, and I still occasionally use other drugs... However, sub quality of life is much better than the dope fiend quality of life. (I suggest getting on Suboxone, go online and look up sub clinics, call one set up an appointment. I currently pay without insurance per month $80 for the visit and $120 for the prescription. $200 is very cheap considering, that would've lasted me 2 days for dope. But it's lasting the whole month now. Subs have saved my life, I suggest getting on them if you're truly struggling.) 

3. Test Replacement Therapy

   Some of you may not agree with this, but again this is just my experience. I was into working out before I ever did dope, and even heavily into my addiction I occasionally worked out. We all know opiates decrease testosterone production, I got mine checked and was at 347. Normal range is: 300-1000. So I was very low T as a 20 year old male. I started looking up test, I really researched all about it, and eventually I found a supplier and I ordered a couple of vials of it. Pinning a little more than trt dose, I feel pretty awesome. It was really a day and night difference how I've felt going from low t to high t. I'm not as depressed, I don't get anxious often, I don't really get stressed even though I work a high stress job. I work out and eat fairly healthy. I look 10x better than what I did. I just feel a lot better. I get my bloods taken every couple of months to make sure I'm good, and buying a couple of test e vials that will last you a year is very cheap. I don't think I'll ever come off. Blasting and cruising for life. (Once you stop doing dope, I suggest you get your t levels checked and ask about trt. Go through a professional, but if you're like me you can easily do it with the right research and subreddits... I feel amazing now, being low t really does have bad effects on your mental health. Because of this I also have to give a lot of credit to testosterone for the quality of life I now live and helping me stay clean. Do some research, I highly suggest this one.) 

4. Working out

   I feel like this one is in everybody's list of things to do when you get clean. That's because it works. It releases endorphins, you see results, you feel better, look better, etc... I've always worked out, I've had breaks here and there, but for the most part its always been a part of my life. Working out has really helped me stay clean and increase my confidence. It's something to do, and it's productive. You feel good afterward, and if you make it a habit you'll feel pretty good a lot of the time. It's no high, but it seems when I'm on a workout binge I don't really feel low. Working out and getting interested in bodybuilding has also helped me gain interest in it as a hobby, it's not just working out for me anymore. Its definitely a big hobby of mine, my day can revolve around lifting and eating. It's pretty awesome. (I suggest working out cause maybe you'll like it? You've got nothing to lose by going for a run, or lifting some weights. Do it for a couple of weeks and evaluate how you felt those weeks. I'm sure you'll say it felt pretty good. Plus, gym memberships are cheap and you can make friends there. Its therapy to put on your headphones and get a pump. Getting into that zone is a high itself.) 

5. Music

   I remember relapsing for the first time and feeling so awful about it. The next day (still feeling really badly about what I had done) I put an album on and listened. It spoke to me, and I related with a lot of it. I jammed the fuck out and didn't feel so alone anymore. I started listening to more and more and discovering new artists, and just listening. Music always helps. I sometimes forget how much help music really is, and then I throw on an album and my problems seem to go away for the duration of that album. (Music is so good, listen to your favorite artists, and discover new ones. Try to make your own music, learn an instrument, learn how to use a digital audio workshop and go that route. But most importantly just listen to music. I promise it will help.) 

6. YouTube 

   I swear I get lost in YouTube for hours and hours, once you find a few channels you really enjoy it's so easy to binge watch their videos. YouTube has helped me tremendously by taking my mind off of things, I guess it's a form of escaping, but it's a healthier one. (Find channels/personalities  you really like, channels that involve your hobby, or have the same humor as you do and once you're subscribed to a few channels it's so easy to just watch YouTube all day and not think of dope or whatever problem you may be facing.) 

7. Having a job 

   I've been an unemployed junkie and I've also been clean and unemployed. Being clean and unemployed sucks more obviously because you're not doing dope. I didn't do anything, I was so bored and relapsing was always in the back of my mind just because I was so bored. I got a job as a waiter at a decent restaurant and I make decent money there. I work about full time, and I'm busy. I don't have time to think about using. I'm too busy, and on my days off I relax and get to do the things that need to be done. Im really never bored, or I try not to get bored because boredom is asking for a relapse so having this job is an awesome cure for boredom. (Get a job, it benefits everyone. But I only suggest this if you're ready for a job. I've been in the shoes where I wasn't ready and it was a disaster. If you're ready for one I promise it'll help so much with the boredom aspect of being clean... Plus you'll have money!) 

8. Get addicted to other things

    This kind of goes with the last four points. Working out, music, YouTube, and my job are my new addictions. Besides YouTube, they're all very productive and will make my quality of life go up. With working out, i make sure I get my macros in for the day, I cook, watch fitness personalities on YouTube and follow them on social media, I'm subscribed to the bb subreddits, get crazy awesome workouts in, I'm always striving for better results, pushing myself, and just love it. I may take a few days off or a week or two off every now and then but I always get back in it and go hard. It takes up time, and it's a good use of my time. 
With music, I follow artists and watch out for new releases, I watch interviews, watch their live performances, I go to concerts now, listening to certain bands make me pick up my guitar and learn new songs, I try to find new music constantly, I make playlists to work out to, music is just a good addiction to have. 
YouTube will be the death of me, I swear. Like I said before once you find a couple of channels you really enjoy you'll get lost for hours at a time. It's a form of escaping, but like I said it's healthier. I urge you to find channels that you like, it's nice when you're bored or feeling down to see three hours go by in a blink of an eye. YouTube is awesome.
And last, my job is an addiction now. I want to get better, I strive to make more money every time I work, I want to show my managers how good of a worker I am, and how capable I am of doing a great job and helping others. It's a good feeling knowing I'm doing my best. 
(Basically what I mean by finding new addictions is to find things to invest your time into. I don't think about dope when I do these. I found a couple, and I'm sure I'll gain more. These right now though are what I choose to do and they help me. Find the ones that will help you!)

9. Other drugs

    So this one isn't necessarily a tip, it's just what I've done and what works for me. You may not agree, but that's okay. It's what works for me. Since last April I've relapsed with dope maybe 5 times. 3 of those times using longer than 3 days, but not lasting over a week. So in a whole year I've been off of dope probably ~ 350/355 days... Which is pretty fucking awesome. The last time I used was December 31st, so it's been about 70 days. I do smoke weed and this past week it's been about everyday, but before this week I kept it at like 3 or 4 times a week only at night when I get off of work, or my days off. I use Xanax and other benzos occasionally, I wish I didn't, but I do. That's something I need to work on. I'll binge for a couple of days, at the most a week and then I'll stop for two weeks or more. I also use cocaine occasionally.  In the past year I've used it probably 15-20 times. I had one 4 day binge in there which sucked, and because of that binge I don't really want to do coke again for a while, and lastly I pop an adderall every now and then. Usually at work, and only when I'm tired af or were very busy. So not very often. And I've drank only a couple times in the past year. Basically what I'm saying is that, the whole ""Total abstinence of drugs preaching"" they do at na or rehab freaks me out. When I have that mindset I feel like a walking relapse. The only drug I want total abstinence from is heroin. The others I can work on later. I'm doing just fine where my use is at right now. Eventually I'll get to that point, but not right now. (This one is a bit different and you may not agree, but hey it works for me. Dope destroyed my life, and these drugs don't. I don't use them everyday, I don't use them every week. I personally feel like I use them at a semi responsible level. At least a level where I'm not fucking my shit up. So hey, whatever. If you wanna smoke that weed... Smoke it. You wanna pop that addy... Pop it. Just don't become dependent on any of those things, because we know how it feels to become dependent. It sucks. That's where ""your new addictions"" come into play. Do something else with your time besides drugs, they're not everything. But you want a release? Do it. Just not heroin or other opiates.) 

10. Mindset

    While using, I didn't care about anyone or anything. I didn't have anything to lose. I didn't care. Once I got a little clean time under my belt and started doing other things I stepped back and analyzed my situation. I'm not alone, many people go through this, and this isn't a way to live. Heroin doesn't solve anything. It just masks it. In debt, have no job, and your gf left you? Heroin is not going to help you. Get that through your head. HEROIN WILL NOT HELP YOU. You have to man up and just do the shit that needs to be done. Simpler said than done, but you just have to do it. Fix your problems, don't mask them with dope. It does get better, and there's a lot you can do in life, but heroin won't let you achieve those goals. Try to be positive, and know it will get better. Yeah, being ""okay"" all the time is kind of boring, but it's better than being dope sick, and well. Just bouncing back and forth between the two hating yourself. ""Okay"" is actually pretty nice. (You've gotta change your mindset into a more positive one. It's hard to believe this stuff when you're using, but you have to know heroin will not fix anything, and that it gets better. Once you're clean for a while you see small positive changes. It's a snowball effect. If you truly believe in that and hope good things will come from being clean and working on fixing your problems, I promise you will live a good life. It just takes time. Don't get lost while waiting. Just do it.)

   I'm sure there's more things that I've done that have helped me get to the point I am now, but those are the ones that have come to my mind.  Again, this is all just my experience that you may or may not agree with, but I'm not using heroin anymore and my life is slowly but surely getting better and better. I must say I'm pretty happy where I'm at right now, I know my life is improving, and yes I do feel down a a lot of times, but I just think to myself it will get better and dope won't fix it. I've gotta fix it. So this is what's worked for me so far, and I hope someone can get even a tiny bit of help out of this post. Thanks guys! If anyone needs to talk just message me, I know how it is. I've been there, and I'm slowly getting out.

Lost all chances/ruined potential. Don't know what to do.,"Longtime lurker/poster. Throwaway account. 


I know this sounds over dramatic but I promise it's not. I'm rational and know when things are just bullshit. But this is different. I can't make it.


Last night my near 3 year girlfriend broke up with me. If I hadn't acted so fucked this week, it wouldn't have happened. I know this. 


I'm dependent on 3.6-5.4g of Phenibut on top of my 1-4mg suboxone daily. Sub: over a year, Phenibut: just under a year (only recently (last five months) got above .75-1.25g daily.


I don't know if I have liver or nerve damage from the Phenibut / sleeping with a belt on in strange positions, but more and more frequently my body's not breathing on its own, my hands/leg(s) are numb, and I get a horrible headache. Horribly constipated/inflamed bowels from the causticity of the Phenibut. Can't swallow well sometimes. Felt food or maybe, fucking hope not, feces in my throat this morning.



Can't even get my mind together enough to focus my thoughts into words. This is ramblings of a madman at this point.

Among other issues. But the main issue is this:

She's gone. She's made it clear there's no chance of anything happening. I know I've held her back. I've ruined everything. She's been with me through a dope addiction and fuckloads of other ordeals. We were supposed to get married. Things were fucking fine until I ruined it with my obsessive and clingy behavior. Literally Monday we were good. She was happy like we're supposed to be. I'm dying. I'm dying.



 I haven't stopped crying since then. I can't do it. 


I want to die. I have to. I've ruined my body and mind. Can't think properly or be half as much of a wordsmith as before. I have an IQ of above 140 (or had, before age 10, that's all I know) and have been/am destroying myself. I don't know what to do.



I love her. I didn't know what love is until I met her. She's the polar opposite of me. Just beautiful and responsible for ALL of her shit. She's too perfect. I don't know what to do. I managed to convince her to see me tonight. But I don't even know what that will accomplish. What to say, how to say it, how not to turn into a begging, blubbering mess. I NEED her in my life. I know we work. I know she needs me. We're seriously meant to be. 


And she's got her own mental shit to deal with. I hate myself.


I missed school (two midterm exams) today. And work. Probably lost that job. 



I can't do it anymore. She's the only one I felt anything for. That made sense to me, that made me feel real. Brought me back to being a person. I LOVE this beautiful human being. She's everything that's right in the world. She doesn't want me. 



I'm just fucking lost. I know I'll hurt so many family members/her by dying, but I have to. I just can't make it. It hurts too much. On top of everything else. I have to. I can't lose her and exist. I'm sorry for the bitching. I have no one.

I have been smoking Heroin regularly (200-300mg max daily) for the last 3 weeks and am going to force myself to detox from it and lower my tolerance again. Might be worth noting I have reasonable experience with various opioids.
I know I am going to experience some withdrawals so I have a couple of questions for y'all. Obviously there are too many variables to be able to predict what I am going to experience accurately so any input would be awesome!

1. How bad are my withdrawals likely to be based on the amount used over the amount of time I've been using?

2. Is there any way I can ease the withdrawals without using Heroin? (I have access to Tramadol, Dihydrocodeine and various Benzodiazepines)

Thanks in advance, I might need some walking through this from what I've read already. I lack any sort of ""rock"" in my life so you guys are the only ones!

All the best.

The troubling part is that opiate deaths seem to be on the increase I am not sure if that is per capita in the US or just overall. Is opiate use in the US more dangerous now than in the past or are more people just using?

Then is another assumption but I think active cuts and RC cuts to be more prevalent now as compared to the past and have been an important factor in the overall dangers of opiate use. What do you think is the prevalence of these types of cuts and how do you think it will effect the overall health of opiate users both long term and short term?

Heroin gave me perspective. It's the only thing I can think of, it's what I strive towards...and guess what, it actually makes me happy. Unlike the lofty goals that people think you should have.

While that's true, if not done in a rather specific way they gel up so badly in my nose that I can't even snort the entire thing even if I use both nostrils... After playing around with them a bit I think I found a pretty good way to make the gelling manageable and get myself nicely loaded, even with the cheap shitty $10 harbor freight dremel set. Of course if anyone has any additional advice or improvements I'd be glad to hear it.



What I used:

* [This dremel set from Harbor Freight, I used the pink grinding stone that looks like a toilet plunger](http://m.harborfreight.com/80-piece-rotary-tool-kit-97626.html)

* Trader Joe's 1000 mcg B12 sublingual tablets (you get a hundred of these tiny pink pills for like $7 and they seem to help mitigate the gelling a lot)

* Glassine bags (In'n'out burger has them piled up in the condiments section next to the yellow chili peppers)

* A fairly shallow and gradually curved plastic bowl

* Needle nose pliers

* Opana (mine are unfortunately 15 mg)



What I did:

* I folded one of the glassine bags in half and used it to crush the B12 tablet and used a credit card to break up the powder, and put it in a line along the crease. One tablet per half of an Opana seems to be the ideal amount.

* Using the MIDDLE (not the end) of the pliers, I very firmly grasped the face of the Opana so that about 3/4 of the pill sticks out to the left towards the dremel bit

* I placed the bowl under the pill and the dremel and used one of my hands to tilt it slightly in my direction in order to maximize the amount of ground pill collected

* With the dremel bit facing directly away from me, I turned on the dremel. This dremel spins clockwise from this point of view. I held it slightly above the tilted bowl and pushed the pill INTO THE 3 O'CLOCK POSITION OF THE BIT (or as close to it as possible)... This is very important because it ensures the pill shavings fly downward into the bowl instead of up into the air. Since this dremel set is $10 it is understandably quite underpowered so you'll need to be patient... I typically do about half a pill before I stop and collect the shavings.

* The bowl should have a fair amount of very fine fluffy white powder. It will probably also have a number of larger flattened pieces. TAKE THESE OUT ( I save them in another glassine for future manipulation) because trying to snort them will make your nose gel up so badly that you can't even snort the whole pill.

* Tap the remaining powder into a corner of the bowl and then tap it into the line of crushed B12 (which should still be on the glassine bag)

* Using a credit card,  gently mix up the powder until you get a fairly uniform mixture of the two pills. Try to push the powder around with as little pressure as possible because you don't want to smoosh the Opana powder into itself because it may form flat flakes that will interrupt the consistency of the mixture and cause severe gelling.

* Get your tooter, stick it a good bit into your nose (try and keep it out of the front because it will gel up and stay there and not get into your sinuses) and sniff away! I usually sniff pretty hard because the mixture still gels up enough that it is unlikely to drip down your throat (and thus get wasted).

* It takes a little bit longer to kick in than the G7x generics, I would say give it 20 or 30 minutes. If it's still gelling up excessively, I find that dropping a few drops of contact lens rewetting drops into my nose clears it up nicely.



Long story short, these can still be snorted like the old pills/generics without too much additional investment, but it is easy to grind them down wrong so I figured this guide should help some people having trouble abusing these pills using a dremel. It does seem to take a little bit more mg of these than the generics but since these are much cheaper to buy on the street I think it's at least worth considering.

My problem staying clean is the fact that I've always been able to get whatever drug I wanted and now I can't.

So I'm wondering if I should go and get a script of Xanax from my doctor. I know I could get it easily since she's suggested it before for my extreme insomnia. I really don't want to start using benzos. But I don't see another way around this. I have to get clean for myself. All I have to do is wait one week and I'll be able to get all the g74s I want again. But I can't go through this all the time.

Methadone was only for a year or two, the rest I was on Suboxone. Ever since I've ever been on bupe therapy I've taken vacations. I've gotten them down to a science to minimize withdrawals hopping back and forth, or so I thought. I am now finding myself with a young son, an opportunity to finish school, and a desire to stop chipping. I've noticed now however suboxone literally makes me feel like shit, basically. Quality of life seems terrible. I feel extremely groggy, tired, with ZERO energy, depressed, and zero motivation. I'm taking between 1 half Zubsolv 5.7mg or 3/4 of a Zubsolv 5.7mg daily. I've been taking the 2mg (or whatever is a .25 is of 5.7) at a time thing for a while now.

I think I have some idea why this is and I am at a loss for how to proceed. I can use between .1 and .2 grams of heroin in a shot and feel it 6 hours post quarter of zubsolv dosing. CAN ANYONE EXPLAIN THIS? It's a decent high, I go from having no energy not in WD but just BLEH to wow this is great i have motivation, energy, i am happy! 2-4 hours later (usually around 8pm) i can take another shot of the same amt of heroin and nod hard at my computer until 2 am or so when I then go to bed. In the morning i take the Zub and push myself with no energy through the workday looking forward to 5 oclock when I can go cop and feel normal/high at least the rest of the night. I can't get bupe to make me feel normal WITH energy and motivation. I cannot afford the high cost of dope here anymore it is ruining me financially and I want to find out why my bupe isn't working or how to make it work. I don't recall ever chipping while I was on methadone, but FUCK the clinic here and the high cost of daily methadone in for profit clinics, plus my sub doc has me on 4mg a day xanax so they would never let me come anyways, and I don't intend on stopping that I've taken it daily for 9 years and coming off of it seems worse than having to kick dope.

2) This damage caused by this use makes it difficult to remember and process past traumas/important life experiences fully
3) Cessation of opiate use does NOT always rapidly result in a complete recovery of all mental faculties and the ability to process trauma/important life experiences for some people.
4) For those who need a little help on the road to mental recovery, smart drugs, especially the Piracetam and Centrophenoxine are amazing at bringing out the cognitive function necessary for processing trauma/significant life experiences. In fact, that was by far the strongest effect I noticed from the Piracetam and Centrophenoxine. I could remember the past, and not just FACTS, but also the EMOTIONAL GRAVITY which, in my experience, is necessary to perceive in order to process the trauma/memory/life experience. I can say it genuinely feels like I'm living a different life and I am seeing through all of the ways in which the people around me were going to allow me to die/kill myself while I slaved away working, simply because they didn't realize/didn't care/""needed"" me to keep working.

OK, I made a) over in r/opiatesrecovery, and I am not going to crosspost the whole thing, so please follow that link to read more if this peeks your interest. (I describe my backstory a bit. Basically, I was traumatized at every turn in my life up until my late teens when I started using opiates and basically just stayed away from the opposite sex and life and tried to tune out my family's consistently traumatic horrible messages to me about myself.)

Anyways...I had been out of rehab for 4 months when I started using smart drugs. I started with mainly choline bitartrate, eggs, and piracetam. The results were quite noticeable -- I was able to think about my past and the things that happened to me in a much clearer way. I cried about my past, something I never did when using, yet the emotion felt relatively ""orderly"" and appropriate. However, my living situation was uncertain and so I was just sort of ""cracked out"" as they say, not sleeping well, etc., so the effect of the smart drugs was limited by that, I think.

Then, I got a more stable situation. 5 months out of rehab I began taking Centrophenoxine aka Lucidril aka a form of DMAE which is actually a prescription drug in some countries (but not, I think, in the United States), and this smart drug serves as a choline source (so I could drop the choline bitartrate which is a very crude choline source, people usually recommend centrophenoxine or most commonly Alpha-GPC or CDP Choline as superior choices). 

Centrophenoxine actually ""scrubs"" a type of pigmentation known as lipofuscin off of the brain at relatively high doses. (I think something like 2g per day has been shown to do this whereas 500 mg per day is thought to at least prevent the buildup. It is speculated on the relevant examine.com page that a 1 month course of centrophenoxine at the high 2g dose could reduce lipofuscin and this benefit would persist even after centrophenoxine usage ceased.)

Piracetam also has an effect on reducing lipofuscin or at least preventing further buildup. For me, it resulted in a quite dramatic ""clearheadedness"" and ""mental health"", it made me feel like I was thinking in a more orderly fashion. It helped me recall memories BIG TIME. I think this effect is so powerful that people should be warned of it and not be scared when they have some relatively vivid memories compared to what they're used to. (No, I didn't have flashbacks, and I am using the term vivid in less of a visual sense and more of a sense of the memory just coming through clearer, however that clarity might be experienced.)

Resveratrol (with bioperine) at 500mg or 250mg per day seems to have a very real revitalizing effect on me. It must be taken with Bioperine for absorption, and I usually take it with 500mg of 90 or 95% Turmeric extract. The bioperine is in the turmeric pill I take. Nicotinamide riboside is an anti-aging supplement, an ""oral form"" (if you will) of NAD+. NAD+ has been used intravenously at clinics to treat drug addicts coming off of opiates and alcohol with, apparently, a great deal of success. (You can see a link to an article about these clinics in my original post that I linked at the top.)

And I also took fish oil, a LEF 2-per day multivitamin (though I can't recommend it), zinc and magnesium (for my testosterone and relaxation -- make sure you get magnesium glycinate or at least magnesium citrate, because magnesium oxide is used as a laxative since it doesn't actually absorb, and thus anything being sold as a vitamin rather than a laxative that contains magnesium oxide is simply a shameless rip-off and a shameless trick by the company marketing it and the retailer selling it), vitamin C (for everything), and a million other things of dubious value.

If you just took the things I've mentioned here, in the right forms and the right dosage, I bet you would see a striking difference. However, I was a VERY, VERY ""hurting pup"" as they say; I was physically wrecked, and thus my brain was also very, very hurt.

TL;DR trying to get a recovering addict to set me up with his connects. 

I'll try to make this short. The guy started working with me about a month ago, he drives extremely nice vehicles. Has a house paid for. So to me that mean drug dealer. Well it turns out that he's an ex dealer that has become completely sober for about 9 months. Because of his legal issues. 

We've been sharing old dope stories. Well recently all my connects have fallen through or a selling straight cut. So while I'm bitching about not having any good heroin in my city. He pipes up and says. No, it's there right now. All day everyday. He begins to tell me about an H connect that has bricks all day. 

My dilemma is this. I don't want him to fall back into addiction. I can see in his eyes that he wants to use so badly. But I do want him to middle for me once so that I can gain a connect. 

Should I be a shitball and just ask for the connect or should I just leave the guy alone and not risk losing his sobriety.  Because I'd feel like death if he began using again because of me.",1457848875.0

I've been scoring some real fire the last week or so #3 but that's it finished so back to regular dope . The stuff was £20 for 0.25g where £20 will normally get you a half gram . When I first got it I was a bit sceptical but divided it into three and cooked up the hit . The stuff was quite dirty and left a scum on top of the liquid . Thought I was bumped at first but sucked up the rest and squirted a little onto my finger and tasted it and had a very bitter heroin taste . Shot it up and boom about 10 seconds later I can feel pins and needles crawl up my neck over my lips and onto the top of my scalp . For me pins and needles are always a sign of top quality dope and you're  close to ODing as well if you feel this  :/ be careful ! . Got a really nice nod going with it :)

 Only problem is its bumped up my tolerance a bit as I've done a gram and a tenner bag today 1.2g and barely felt it... Meh! I've got some done and I'll get some on Tuesday as well so I'm going to take abit of a tolerance break .

Usually this is absolutely fucking miserable and leaves me feeling like dogshit for days after, even on a dose as low as 10.

Recently though I started selling on morphine tabs for my uncle who beat cancer by smoking weed and so doesn't take any of the pharms he is supplied to deal with the pain and post-care stuff (he gets 60 30mg Extended Release pills every month).

It's been going so well that a couple months ago he gave me some of this ""Lyrica"" stuff that comes in white capsules to see if I could shift them as easily.
I couldn't, no-one seems to know what they are so there's no market, so I looked into it and found that they contain Pregabalin, a drug sometimes used off label for alcohol and opiate withdrawal so I kept them aside for when I needed them.

A few weeks later my done dose dropped to about 8mg/day (I was decreasing 1mg/week) and I just couldn't cope so I called my worker to book an appointment to put it back up to 10mg til I go to Detox but I had to wait a few weeks.

By the time it dropped to 6mg I couldn't take the pain and the sweating so I took 2 of the 150mg Pregabalin capsules and it all just stopped.

From then on until I saw the Doc at my recovery place to sort out my script I took 300mg when I woke and 300mg a few hours before bed every day and it was amazing, for the first time in maybe 2 years I felt how it used to feel to be sober, and I had forgotten how good not being in withdrawal was.

Since then I always have some on hand and the difference they make is fucking bananas.

About 2 weeks ago I was taking them every day for a week as an experiment, during which time I forgot to take my 'done for 3 days and felt totally fine; before I would have been a desperate mess.

TL;DR
Pregabalin is AMAZING for opiate withdrawals and if I had known about and had access to it when I quit H I would NOT have gone on Methadone, Bupe etc, I would have taken Pregabalin for a week or 2 and been totally fucking killing it.

I'm not sure if it's ever been proposed or if people are going to think it's a really stupid idea, but I was thinking maybe we could get a discussion going about how to handle this growing and evolving problem. My thoughts were maybe every 3 or 6 or even 12 months having a sub-wide vote (with acounts a month old or more to avoid multiple votes per person) on a ""panel"" of members so to speak, that then in turn can vote on proposed bans of users (trolls). So for example, there'd be a sticky thread  - someone can propose to ban or suspend a user, and after a set number of people agree for it, then the ""panel"" gets to vote whether they deserve a ban or not.

It would obviously have to be a mature group of users on it to keep the sub honest, but maybe like 11-21 people on it. I just really think something needs to be done about these trolls coming in here just bringing every thread to shit. Makes me just want to walk away from the sub, and I've lurked here for years before making an account. I love this group and its like a home to me where we can all talk about the things that we can't get out in our home lives.

Let me know that everyone thinks, whether I'm an idiot that's out of line and it'd never work, or if you like the idea. Hope everyone is well and nice and high or staying clean if that's your thing!

4acef0,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/4acef0/fentanyl_my_first_experience/,4,https://redd.it/4acef0,Iwasatgoogies,"Fentanyl, my first experience","So I came across a couple Sandoz 75mcg/hr patches and had had no prior experience with the drug. Right now tolerance is fairly low because of a well needed hiatus, so I hit the web to figure out if this was something worth touching at all. 

What I found was 95% of people stated that Fentanyl was scary, dangerous and not worth touching, especially if you don't have a crazy high tolerance to opiates. Many also stated that despite being so potent, and similar to heroin in some ways, recreationally it really lacked depth/euphoria. It's ""cold"" and ""clinical"". 

Well, a dude was curious, and it was all he had! I figured if I started very small it would cut the risk greatly. I decided to slice a small portion of the patch off and gum it (buccal I think it's called?), maybe 1/20-1/10 of the whole thing. At first I didn't feel shit (I didn't leave it in for very long). I continued messing around with it, keeping it in longer and longer and the stuff slowly but surely came around within 30 minutes. 

I understand where people are coming from when they say it ""lacks"" something euphoria-wise. It feels like potent dope, i.e sedation, sense of well being, some warmth etc. but it really did feel like the best parts of an opiate high weren't quite there. That was evident as i continued to do more, which I did over the next 3 days to finish the 1st patch. I also noticed it's pretty short duration, I would have to suck and chew on more patch every hour or 2 it seems, using 1/8-1/10 strips.

All and all though, it's a unique high and I would have to disagree with all the hating out there, it has me feeling really nice and I appreciate this 2nd patch more then the first. Although it oddly doesn't lift me up the same way other opiates do :/ Does anyone know chemically why this is??
 Another thing I noticed was that nodding/resparitory depression did not occur in the amount that many said it would in arguments for never touching this stuff (which was a major concern of mine going into it). Maybe by taking it in the gums in small increments I avoided this, and if anything it sometimes kept me up late into the night enjoying the buzz. I am not saying that fentanyl is not extremely potent and dangerous, and I think people should tread VERY cautiously with it, but from my recent naive experiences I believe a well informed and careful user can enjoy it safely enough. 

I'm curious what other people's experiences are. Do people get so heated about Fentanyl and discourage it's use because of the number of deaths that occur when marketed as dope/and taken the wrong way/in extreme amounts by uninformed people? Chances are I won't be returning to fent because the downsides seem to outway the benefits big time, but I can't say I'd take back my choice to experiment with it. It's not on the top of the list of opiates, but it's a unique and mysterious one to me. I guess it was good to go into the experiment so cautious and spooked, but it left me feeling like: why the hell are they saying ""stay far away"" instead of informing people the safest and best way to use fent. recreationally. and do the majority of people not share my enjoyment of it?

Ironically that makes me a coward.

Therefore, i would expect there to be a big difference in stopping between a person who uses for a week or two, vs months - years. 



I am looking for stories of people who have taken suboxone for less than a month, or even less than 2 weeks, and their experience getting off it. How long can suboxone be taken before the withdrawal from bupe is worse than the withdrawal from the heroin you are trying to get off? If you do a 5 day detox for example, where you induce yourself on subs at an 8mg dose (i know thats high, but assuming you've bounced back and forth a few times, the effectiveness goes down,) and over 5 days gradually cut it, taking a dose of 1/2 mg on the 5th day, when would the sub withdrawal peak?

I feel amazing. just wanted to write about it and share my experiences over the years. i hope you'll take a second to read and share yours. i'm so desperate to connect with others who share these desires and interests. i'm alone here.,"I remember the first time I was introduced to oxycodone. I had a major sinus surgery where they removed adnoids, bone fragment, cartilage, and a variety of other overgrown tissue and bone that kept me from breathing while sleeping.

the first day I took it, i puked. but i persisted because i was in so much pain. after that, it was magical. 

the script ran out, the pain subsided with advil, and i moved on, happy for the fun experience and to feel better. 

years later, i had a foot surgery. got a full script, paced it out so that i wasn't goign to hard on them (2-3 every 4 hours), and it was an amazing month and a half. but that wrapped, and i moved on.

one thing i noticed on them, was that my writing was absolutely incredible. the foot surgery i had fell during a college semester, and the class project my girlfriend and I wrote (it was for an innovative entrepreneurship elective track) won first prise and a $30,000 grant with a bunch of business incubator resources (which we totally blew and didn't take advantage of - not because we were high, we were just lazy and childish.)

my question is this. everyone knows using these drugs is bad. im siting here, in the perfect body high cocoon. I'll leave tomorrow, and I'll give it a rest for a few days. i'm lucky in that regard. 

but i know deep down, my love for these opiates is something serious and real. its a sign of depression. or at least professional apathy. i often find myself withdrawn for a half hour a day, filled with dread and the desires to cancel my plans. Of course i go in the end, and its fine, but the anxiety and fear i fell during the meal/drinks/party is something no one should ever fear.

is there a way to approach a doctor with that information and have them listen to you and respect your opinion, because yes, i self medicated, and oxy worked magnificanly well for me to overcome many things.

is this an indication that i may have a sort of depression or an anxiety disorder? Has anyone in the scientific community ever done a study to see which variety of drugs people with certain disorders are drawn to? isn't the persons choice of a drug saying something profound about the circumstances of the person who is taking it?

i don't consider myself addicted to oxy. i take long breaks, and i don't feel strong urgers during those breaks. but, i'm also aware that many peple who were addicts have said similar things right up into their deaths. i do, however, consider myself addicted to food. 

If you all would be so kind, I would love it for you to take a moment and share your thoughts on this. 

Maybe we can keep it civil - just talk about the topic, and try to be respectful and mindful of other points of view. I think its important that this not turn into a trump style rally.

I'm really hoping this works. Thank you in advance.

Tomorrow that changes. We've spent the last month getting high basically everyday. I already  feel guilty enough for dragging people through my shit. 

Most of you will understand that drugs are the single reason I have for not killing myself. It's true. But as of tomorrow,  I won't have drugs to rely on. So,  I don't know how I'll handle it. The thirst for no longer being here is stronger than urge to get high. It's something that eats at you until the second you fall asleep. 

But tomorrow,  I'm going to try to ignore those urges. Try to create some semblance of a normal life. Not for me,  for everyone around me. 

You guys have brought me so much joy and companionship through some really awful times,  and while I might be a lurker every so often,  you'll see my name less and less,  and you may have even noticed my absence lately.

I cleaned myself off of meth 18 years ago so I know a little about addiction but I don't know about opiate addiction like I should. My sister is 27. Today I drove 80 miles to pick my sister up after she got out of rehab then promptly got kicked out of the home her and her abusive boyfriend shared with his parents. They have a 3 year old boy together. The boyfriends family is taking care of the child but keeping him from my sister.

At this point I do not think my sister is in a position to care for her child. I took her out of the equation and she is now staying with me.

I am currently emptying my house of valuables but I have no idea how to tell if she is using. We are trying to get her to realize she will never have her child if she is on the shit. I'm looking for any advice. Thank you.

I am not a ""redditor"", so I apologize in advance for any rules that I may break and I thank you for your understanding. I am a 21-year-old woman who lives with her boyfriend  (26,m), and we're both addicted to heroin. I want to know if it's possible to wean myself off. I had a 9-month period of cleanliness from 2014 to 2015, but I relapsed last May and have been using daily from then on. Since then, I have had 3 overdoses which led to hospitalization (all within 2 months), one of which landed me in the ICU. I got an abscess, went to treatment for a month, and when I got out I eventually started using again. I'm so sick of this shit, I don't know why I do this to myself... Anyway, I began recording my usage yesterday, and found that I used 12 dabs (no IV use, my boyfriend and I dab it). When I do the math I only use about a quarter gram a day, which is nowhere near the amount I used when I was dosing intravenously, but it's enough to make me hate life every morning if I sleep for more than 8 hours. I've kicked before and I honestly think that this time is worse than even my gram a day habit that I'd kicked awhile back. I haven't had a period since last July, I've lost probably about 25-30 pounds, and I just look like complete shit. I really want to stay off this time, and if anyone has any suggestions or advice on how to go about lowering my doses I would appreciate it immensely. My boyfriend is a drug dealer and I'm not sure if he wants to quit, but I'm hoping that he will when he sees me doing it. I'm not working right now and I'm sick of my boyfriend threatening me with remarks like ""I think it's time for you to kick"", or ""you might be starving today"", so please, PLEASE help me figure this out as soon as possible. I love my boyfriend and we're actually engaged, but I feel like my addiction just makes him hate me and I don't want to live like this anymore. Thank you so very much for taking the time to read my post, and I hope that you all have a beautiful day.

*what do you do best when you're high?*

for me, I find it easier for myself to do the following things after sniffing pills:

* Making music: when I nod I find it a lot easier to produce music. the anxiety and second thinking goes away and I find myself a lot more creative and at peace

* writing: same as music^

* social interaction: all of my social anxiety is gone and I can easily discuss various topics with people at ease and I also show more genuine interest

* caring about things: when I'm high (not so much nodding), I seem to actually give a shit about more things and people in my life. I have more interest in things and actually putting forth effort 

* having a more positive self image: for those of you who have depression, you may relate. I tend to think more highly of myself when I'm on pills or h. I see past the flaws and give myself credit for what I really am and what I'm good at. I seem to focus more on my creativity and realize I actually am a fairly good artist.
