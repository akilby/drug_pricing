Also side question if you crush up one 80 with 4 20mg IR and snort it does it effect the high. I ask because if you snort an 80 by itself the high takes longer to quick in but last longer compared to an 80 mixed with 20mg.",1513073421.0

I personally have tried quite a few differing medicines to help and I’ll list the ones that were actually effective. 

Loperamide: helps quite a bit with the gastrointestinal tract symptoms of withdrawal. Very minor decrease in cravings. Major decrease of restless leg syndrome but not perfect. Zero help with insomnia. Use as last chance help since it’s not very effective overall and has a chance of doing severe heart damage. 

Butalbital, caffeine, cpap: no help with physical side effects of withdrawal, but minor decrease in cravings. 

Mirtazapine: very very effective with physical symptoms of withdrawal. Decreases restless leg syndrome to nearly zero, decreases itchy skin feeling, can also defeat insomnia if you normally don’t take it. Does not help with gastrointestinal symptoms. 

Agmatine: doesn’t help much with the symptoms of withdrawal, but continues to help lower tolerance. So it slowly lowers the symptoms as well as making your next opiate dose stronger. 

Kratom: helps with all physical symptoms of withdrawal including gastrointestinal. Also helps with cravings to a small extent and can help with chronic pain if you are self medicating.

Ondensatron: helps with vomiting and slightly reduces craving. 

My “silver bullet” that helped me through an unexpected and unwanted withdrawal of five days was red kali kratom and mirtazapine. Take that for what you will, I was mostly able to do my normal stuff. Still had a ton of cravings, but I was able to survive. And able to sleep, so that was amazing. Slept through a lot of the withdrawal. ",1513059042.0

I live in Europe, and all the heroin i can get here is heroin base, 
I like to smoke it on foil.
I recently accuired some supposedly aprox 90% pure heroin#3 from dnm. 
His last batch was lab testes to 92% and this batch was supposedly just as good. 
It Even had the link to the lab test, and his reviews were really really positive. 
I an not a Heavy user-, I use maybe once or twice a months, 
Usually I Can easily smoke 0.5g of the stuff i get at home in an evening. 
But 50mg og this smoked over 3 hours had me nodding like a mofo.And the euphoria was absolutly amazing. And each hit gave men incredible rush!
 It was some Next level shit.
But i noticed that my teeth got really sticky when i smoked it.
Is this normal for high purity heroin? Or is It becuse of something else? Thanks in advance",1513040206.0
7j6u5w,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7j6u5w/i_messed_up/,7,https://redd.it/7j6u5w,solidsnake911,I messed up,"Well, I will be brief: I was addicted almost 4 years to strong opiates to manage chronic pain, under prescription, but I ended addicted anyway. I detoxicated a few years ago, and after 7 months with Suboxone I found kratom, and that change my life to incredibly better than before. 

But I'm passing a hard time in my life now, specially for the fact that I think that my girlfriend and me broke yesterday, after a long period of crisis and break up 3 times. And the last week I lost the control:  somedays I smoked fentanyl, another day I snorted hydromorphone and another days oxy. I think if wasn't the entire week (wich would probably), at least 6 days.

Now sometimes I'm in withdrawal, the Saturday night I took 15mg of oxy divided in the night. Nothing since then except kratom, that really helps a lot, but sometimes the withdrawal kick in hard.

Now I'm studying a course and I cannot allow have withdrawal in class, because they would send me to my home. I have a few blisters of Suboxone 2mg (buprenorphine/naloxone), the question is: this could me help to manage the withdrawal if became worse? I can combine it with kratom and have effects? There are differents opinions about this case for here and bluelight. I take low doses, 5-6g per day is good for me and for my pain.

What would do you recommend me guys? Thanks in advance. ",1513039494.0

While the nurses struggled to sedate me, two lesbian tweakers were driving my car around in a city I hate and I ended up eit h a bunch of free meth.","If anyone remembers my job post, I get my first check on the 20th, so until then I have been continuing the ridiculous and unstable activity of street running to get money. An adventure every day and/or night. 

So last night I was with these two girls who I call my Favorite Lesbian Tweaker Duo. We've all helped each other beyond what's necessary, put a lot on the line for each other, etc. I fucking love these girls. It seems like the world is always trying to pry them apart, and no matter how hopeless they always hold on. It's one of the most beautiful relationships I've ever seen and I do everything in my power to help keep them together and keep them both alive. Late last night we had some deals set up in the big city in the county over, we had to make a stop in a town on the way there and overall come out with good profit and a decent amount of shard. I was going to keep my cash and sell my shard, I try not to fuck it with it often these days because I need money more than I need more problems. We end up at this kids house in the town on the way to the city, we had a bunch of stupid shit that he wanted and was going to trade us heroin for it (still digusted by and clean off heroin, we needed it to set up for a bigger deal in the city). After awhile of negotiation we get a good deal, he almost burns his house down and we leave. On the way to my car I slipped on icy pavement and tried to catch myself on the back of the kids car with my right arm. Going down and suddenly trying to rapidly propel my body weight back up using only my right arm... I guess has potential to really fuck you up. Who knew? 

It's horrible pain, but I move past it. We get in the car and head to the gas station, and I find I can't use the arm at all. It's whatever, yeah it hurts like a cruel cunt but this shouldn't take long and I'll deal with it when I get where I'm staying. Minute by minute the pain in my shoulder and arm is rapidly progressing in intensity, one of the girls sees I'm clearly struggling and offers to drive. I let her. We go get gas and I just can't take it. It's excruciating. I can't think, I'm about to pass out from the pain, and it's so bad it's making my body tremble. We all agree I should go to the ER. On the way there I told them the hustle must go on, you girls take my car to the city, perform the tasks we must meet and come back and visit me. It takes about 10 minutes to get me out of the backseat into a wheelchair. You guys I'm no bitch but my Jesus fucked up Christ it was terrible pain. 

Gonna try to make the rest short. Haven't touched opiates since I got clean and don't want to. As soon as they get me in a room I tell them I'm a former heroin addict and do not want opiates until all other options are exhausted. They congratulate me and do what they can do. With all other pain killers being equally effective for pain as a soggy bagel would be, they say if I want the pain to stop we'll need to use narcotics. I agree. 2 doses of IV dilaudid later and... It didn't do dick. Pain is just as it was and still getting worse. I'm cussing like a sailor all the way through x rays. After that I get a suprise visitor, so I call my Favorite Lesbian Tweaker Duo and tell them to take my car to their place so they can get home and rest, I'll keep them updated and grab the car in the morning. 

Shoulder was dislocated, they said it hurt some muscles and there's probably nerve damage from tearing, one of the worst they've seen. Great, now pop that bitch in place so I can go make ends meet. 

One dose of anesthesia

> How do you feel? 

> Ya know, rockin and rollin, the usual. You?

1.5 doses of anesthesia

> Feelin Okay?

2 doses of anesthesia 

> You feeling sleepy yet?

> No things are kinda weird though. I have a good headchange. Look if it's faster to just amputate I'm down. 

3 doses of anesthesia

> You're seriously still up? Do you know what's happening? 

> Yeah you guys aren't compensating enough for my body's norm being intoxication. Definitely getting real loopy but this is breakfast to me. 

3.5 doses of anesthesia 

> *mumble mumble mumble, something about toxic dose and then something about fentanyl

> wait the fentanyl isn't for me right? 

> Nope. 

It was definitely for me. 1 dose of fentanyl topped off with 2 doses of ketamine and I'm out like a junkies happiness on a family holiday. I always thought anesthesia was just you taking a nap and then you wake up not remembering details and the work done. Nope. You guys that shit is so fucking trippy. Like holy fuck I can't even describe it, it was so lit though I would definitely do it again. I've done a lot of acid but that was the trippiest thing I have ever experienced hands down. 

So yeah my favorite girls completed the mission and I had someone take me to where I'm staying at like 3:30 in the morning. Went to the girls house this morning to get my car back. They gave me my cut of the cash and meth. When I got my car to my place, I assessed damage and they spilled shards of meth FUCKING EVERYWHERE. EVERYWHERE. Like seriously it doesn't even seem fair. I don't know how much they got in total but it must have been enough for them to not give a fuck. 

Good times. Can't wait to get paid so I can get away from street bullshit. I'm not sure how to feel about the opiates in a medical setting. Ideally I don't want to take them under any circumstances, but I had to relieve that pain. I don't feel triggered, I don't feel like using, but I'm still worried as to what that might do in regards to stimulating my opioid receptors causing subconscious opiate driven thought processes. But Saturday will be 8 weeks and you bet your ass I'll make it there. Then deal with the struggles of week 9. Brush myself off and start on double digits. 

Dunno, was an interesting experience for me and I love the fuck outta you guys so I wanted to share. Stay smart, stay safe.",1513037945.0

Fast forward to last night. I was unpacking some of my shit that has been put away since my incarceration and I found between .5-1g of U-47700 and close to 100mg of etizolam. Now mind you, neither of these compounds will show on the drug test I am on and I thought strongly about going waaay the fuck in, but my rational self made a better choice. I flushed them after holding them in my hands for like 15 minutes. I was shaking when I did it. The crazy thing is I almost felt euphoria for like an hour after doing this.

(And a story of a year wasted on oxy),"Went on a couple month oxy binge (after chipping on and off for probably 9/12 of the last months. This recent go around i was starting around 90-120mg/day and peaking around 300mg/day when i could afford that much :0

Got clean for a week with the use of dones for the first 3 days, 30mg/day just to get me
Through the worst of the oc detox, it wasn’t hard at all w/the dones...and only mentally hard after.

Went back to oxy for a couple weeks, stopped w/4mg sub a day for 4 days and then stopped and was totally clean for another week until I had a nerve being pinched again which was the last excuse I needed to go back for another week

Now I’ve been on 30-50mg of methadone for the last week and I’m ready to stop, they almost feel too good? I wasn’t getting as high as i wanted to even w high dosages of oxy toward the end (120mg at a time of IR at times, 160 mg OP at times), but 30-40mg of methadone makes me extremely content and motivated...way cheaper than spending 90-300/day on oxy, more like $20/day for 40mg methadone. I know it’s horrendous to get off of if you take it long term so my time has come to face sober reality again 


Will I experience w/d from methadone or just some return of PAWS?


The only reason I’m quitting is due to the absolutely ignorant waste of hard earned money that it entails...I still love that feeling and don’t feel “over it” yet...I feel like most people would’ve switched to heroin a while ago in my shoes (not much regular  income , most all of which goes toward the pills when I’m on them. H is so much cheaper and I’ve smoked it twice and honestly thought it was lacking compared to a strong oxy high. (I know it was good BTH, also-but there’s starting to be fent in BTH too...). Oxy is like a euphoric stimulant for me, H just never fully fills that feeling i seek, last time I kept hitting the foil until next thing I know I’m coming-to knelt down by my bed. Apparently I passed out before I could reach where I wanted to go mentally... I just felt fucked up and lethargically numb (but not in a crazy awesome way...). 

At least I’m not doing or care to do heroin anymore ...right...? The mental haunting that follows you around feels like it’s never gonna go away again. I’ve gone months clean and still have dreams of doing oxy and it’s so realistic that I feel that long lost feeling and wake up wondering where more of that feeling (my drugs) are. Then I remember it was a dream and want nothing more than to actually feel that warm blanket come over me again...it’s ruined the last year of my life...it may as well have just Not happened...it feels like maybe 2 blurry months. I moved 6 times. I’m in debt to friends in family and have lost most of my close relationships due to lack of contact . I’m dull and pretty much void of interest/energy/motivation..

The depression is just too much to handle eventually when a Shit storm in life starts brewing :/ just took an op80 and 120mg
Roxy and won’t b getting more, I barely feel it 😳😞

Will I ever feel fucking normal again? Because it’s starting to feel hopeless. I wasn’t happy before I did  any type of drugs, either... I’ve also done therapy for 3 years (6 years ago...and I was on benzos for most of time so I didn’t recall or register half of that .

Funny thing is fentanyl been in Aus for years - particularly on the DNMs. Albeit only ever sold as fent. The newspaper article made out that it just went BANG - fent laced heroin now awash on the streets. 10 overdose deaths in the span of a week in the suburb of Richmond (ground zero for cold copping in Melbourne) alone. 
And all the experts say this is only the beginning... 
i’m aware 10 ods is just NOTHING compared to what you poor souls in the states are dealing with on a daily basis. 
The article said that your in the grip of the worst opioid epidemic in history. It’s just that we went from 0 deaths EVER! To 10 in a week. From something that was previously unheard of...

It seems the days of paradise here were we bought heroin - and every time, it was in fact just heroin, are now over :( Test shots and test kits will now need to be embraced by users. Narcan is not widely distributed over here yet either. I wonder how many people will have to die before they wise up with its regulation and freer distribution

In my last previous post I was discussing the fact that today I had obtained 2xoc 80s - since determined to be fake and prolly fent.. seriously, I know this is nothing new for you guys. But, even as little as a few months ago that was completely unheard of here! 
I’m truly saddened by what is sure to be just the start of a serious shitstorm over here that is going to needlessly take many lives. Most of which could have surely been prevented. Australia has always been a late bloomer compared to other western counties. But, as a follower nation particularly of the UK and the US, I just we could have somehow payed more attention to what’s happening elsewhere and realised that it’s coming our way - and prepared for it somehow. Instead we will just follow in America’s footsteps as always and watch the death toll rise. ",1513159513.0

I want to start out by saying that the shit my plug gets is very consistent, with respect to potency. He buys straight from the runners that are associates of the cartel, so the quality is always the same. My plug contacts me this week saying that he can now get BTH that is twice as potent for only a 25% price increase. 

I'm like ""how did you pull this off."" He said that he got in the Mexican runner's car and the runner, who speaks very little English, said ""clean or dirty."" And he was like ""what the hell, you never said I had options before. I want the clean shit."" 

Well sure enough, the stuff was twice as potent. I did 0.2 instead of my normal 0.4 and I was feeling great. The stuff might have even been better than twice as good. Anyway the shit is so good, I immediately get more the next day.

Well I loaded up 0.22 or so, and I felt well but not high. I was like ""shit, he got the dirty batch."" I start to look at my arm and notice it is a bit raised near the injection site. I think to myself: ""maybe I missed and skin popped it by accident."" But I remembered registering, so I shrugged it off.

A few hours later I load up another shot, but this time I put in like 0.32. I'm not 100% convinced that I didn't miss the previous shot, but I'm pretty confident, so I don't do my normal 0.4 to be safer.

Well within seconds of pushing the plunger down, I feel the hit, but it is an order of magnitude or more than usual. And this time it is combined with a feeling of nausea. I'm saying to myself ""oh shit, I wish I still had some glass to hit right now to counteract this, because I am in for the ride and there is no way off."" And that is all I remember.

Next thing I recall, I'm sitting up in my car, in the parking lot I was in. I'm sweating bullets, super nauseated, and I have a horrific headache. I look at the clock and forty minutes had passed. 

The nausea finally gets me and I open my car door and vomit out the side. I spend the next 15 minutes piecing together what had happened. I figure my seat belt might have saved my life, by keeping me sitting upright and breathing. I think the horrific headache was from a lack of oxygen getting to my brain possibly.

FIRST AND FOREMOST: THE GOLPIATE RULE, OR GOLDEN OPIATE RULE. IT SAYS 
""IF YOU ARE AN ACTIVE OPIATE USER OR HARM REDUCTION ENTHUSIAST, DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO ACQUIRE SOME FORM OF NARCAN/NALOXONE, AND BECOME EDUCATED ON OVERDOSE AND HOW TO HELP REVERSE IT WITH THE USE OF NARCAN/NALOXONE OR LEARN HOW TO PROLONG LIFE AS EFFICIENTLY AS POSSIBLE UNTIL PROPER MEDICAL HELP ARRIVES."" 

Seriously guys, even at the most basic level of hands on research or even at least reading about and watching videos of how to administer CPR/prolong life for as long as possible. If you are a user or around users, it can, and WILL make a difference, potentially of life or death. 


Talk about a scary surreal eye opening experience. She was a new user but insisted that she wanted to IV. Hey, adults can make their own decisions, but I advise strongly against the idea explaining my reasoning, such as drug interactions and the very real chance for an OD. While talking about OD I figured a good time to teach a new user about narcan or naloxone injectable version, so I brought out my small .4mg/1ml vial of naloxone and a 25g needle. I explain the signs and what to look for, how to determine if it's a nod or an OD, how to determine the severity, and what steps to taking in the case of the incident. Call 911, provide location, administer first dose of narcan and begin CPR rescue breathing no compressions. Administer consecutive doses at 5 and 10 minutes if no response or not enough improvement. Figure make sure she understood in the off chance she ever has to potentially save one and has access to it which probably is pretty slim, but hey, look where I am. 

Quick note: few months ago my friend and partner gave me a single dose .4mg/1ml vial of liquid naloxone with a IM syringe in a kit that looked to have been administered at a harm reduction convention, it too had brief instructions on how to handle the event. 

Now the story. We are in my room getting high and I tell her how I shoot and she wants to watch and think about trying it again. I do my shot and proceed to answer her questions and inform her of any knowledge I have that I thought important, with consistent reminders that it's a bad idea and I advise against it, but I'm not one to lie so yes it does feel great but, in exchange for later feeling bad

She ponders and still decides she wants to try. She tells me about her tolerance and I from what she says I figure we try a .05 shot of some okay tar. My tolerance isn't even insane and I've shot up to .25 of it. Her veins are EXTREMELY hard to hit but I finally register on her forearm, and she moved after about 40-60% went in so a small amount missed but I couldn't stop in time because it wasn't even like 30 units of water in the whole shot. Clean it up and tell her to wait it out and reassure her the miss is okay it will just hurt a little like a bruise. About an hour and a half to two hours later she wants to try again. My high had finished by now, she never visually looked with with no nod or slur or anything, so I figured sure. I stated she would go first in case I needed to provide any assistance which was pretty unlikely. I thought. She wants to do a bigger shot. I say absolutely not and prepare another .04-.05 shot. Register much easier and hit perfectly. Now she says she starts to feel it. Sits back a little and I'm talking while prepping my shot and soon after she stopped responding I look over to her. *says name* no response *louder* no response, stop for one second, check pulse and breathing, and determined this an overdose.   Call 911 and provide address and details, advise to hold off on dispatching an ambulance just yet(wanted to avoid the law if possible but would not risk her life)Knowing how strong inj naloxone is and how small the dose was I figured I would not need the whole dose. I draw a third of naloxone out and give a IM shoulder injection. Wait the longest two minutes ever while checking for breathing. Near non existent and far apart, slowing down. Administer dose 2 shoulder INJ. Breathing has now stopped, began CPR rescue breathing (breath for them every 5 seconds). After a few breaths two gasps and some self breathing, but slowed back to a stop. Administered final and full dose of narcan after a few more breaths a few more gasps came and she began self breathing again. Shortly came to be able to respond to sentences and say words but couldn't remember what had happened. Clearly couldn't fully comprehend ehat had happened and didnt believe she was actually dead until I showered her the narcan vial and lectured her. 

What I want you to take from this is simple. Be PREPARED AND KNOWLEDGEABLE. should I not had that naloxone and educate myself, she absolutely would have died if paramedics weren't fast enough. If i didn't have naloxone to administer I would immediately request the ambulance no matter what and follow up with CPR rescue breathing until they arrive. After her confession I explained that why you dont bang heroin if it's only your third time when you've been drinking on xanax just because you like the guy youre hanging out with. That's a good message to take too. 

Wow. Still hard to wrap my head around it 

Edit:spelling, words, tldr, new golpiate rule. 

TL;DR: Hanging out w new girl, shoots, ODs and is dead at one point, brought her back to life with three separate doses of injectable naloxone and CPR rescue breathing for... I'm not sure how long. It felt like 5-7 min I had to breath for her, and she was probably unconscious for about 20 min total. Stressing the importance of being prepared and supplied, educated, and TAKING ACTION.

Been awhile, in need of a lil advice regarding the ‘bonus goodies’ that came with my dark net market purchase 😳","So me and 4 mates are going to see Muse play in a few days. As usual the burden to get some gear for such special occasions falls on the biggest drug pig of our group - me. So we pool our cash and order a whole bunch of coke off the dark net markets - which has since arrived. On weight and quality blow - no problems there. Anyways with the small amount of btc left over I decide to order just 25mg of my past lover - fentanyl, to be put into a nasal spray bottle. I figure a little sedating after a huge night on the stims and booze will be the perfect night cap. So my 25mg of fentanyl powder arrived today. But with a bonus of 2 OC 80s. Quite the bonus considering oxy in Aus is just stupid expensive - almost as bad as coke! Lol. In fact 2 OC 80s would be nearly twice as much as what the actual fent order cost! So I take one look at them and realise they ain’t from a pharmacy. The OC is printed HUGE on the pill and not centered. While they are green. It’s not a straight thick waxy green. More like a light green with speckles in it. They actually look more like ecstasy pills than oxy pills. I grab some scissors to cut one in half expecting that ‘resistance’ you usually get from them and will almost no force it just crumbles away revealing the same shade of green throughout the whole pill. No white on the inside whatsoever. I’ve questioned the vendor hoping to get any info I can on em but no response. Yet at least... Considering how dangerous fent can be in unknown doses (my nasal spray mixtures are always spot on to the Milligram/mL) is there any safe way of finding out what i’m in for if I consume any amount of these? Honestly i’m thinking of just flushing them. I’m not sure if anyone here remembers me but I’ve been clean from opis for a good long while now and would have next to no tolerance. I’m also lucky enough to be in a position where I don’t crave them enough to say fuck it and just chance unknown doses of ANY opiate - let alone fucking fent! I just want to go see one of my favourite bands with my mates and have a good time - not fucking die! If I got ahold of some kinda test kit could it tell me exactly what they are and how much of it? Or do they only tell that it is, say fent - but not how much or how strong it is. Lastly, it’s been a long time, just wanna say I hope your all doing well. Especially anyone neck deep in the game. Any advice as always is much appreciated from my favourite bunch of drug pigs that have never met me but somehow know me better than I know myself.

Myself, I don't, I find it pointless, even with BTH. The only reason to do it, is to make it breakdown faster, which you can do with friction. Now that I just did ECP, I boiled it down, simply because I thought that's what you do with ECP to ""release"" more of the good stuff (IDK).


I got into an arguement with a friend, whether or not cold shots are dangerous, etc.


I always used this page as my source:
https://www.heroinhelper.com/user/admin/cold_shot.shtml



TLDR: I find boiling up a shot to be pointless, if anything wasteful. Is there any actual benefit to boiling shots? Or is this just a thing they do in movies to signify ""oooh he's a bad guy!"" kind of moment?

I've been there. I am also in active addiction. I get it. It's quite a mess, constantly. If they don't hate each other, they love each other too much. Typical junkie love shit.

She lives with me. He thinks he lives with us. Typical pain in the ass living with a couple but it goes beyond that. I come home to screaming and yelling most days which I am unfortunately used to. I guess he tried crack a few weeks back and has been binging like crazy and last night.... shit got physical.

When I got home, she said she came home to E locked in the basement and she said she could almost smell burning rubber or something close. She was trying to get into the basement because E was ignoring her when E busted out of the basement knocking the door into her. I guess she swatted him ""in a playful way"" were her words but I wasn't there. She told me things escalated very quickly and it was like flipping a switch. One minute he was somewhat concerned he may have hit her with the door, the next he was shoving her against the wall. I guess he smacked her in the head pretty hard and got in her face about ""personal space"" and bullshit before retreating to the basement, assumedly to use more crack.

When I got home I found E in the still locked basement, and could smell what K smelled, definitely crack. K was in her room visibly upset and she told me everything that happened SO MILDLY like it was no big deal? That's physical abuse. And emotional abuse. 

I know it's not my place to step in. I also can't let my roommate get hurt. Anyone ever been here? I need major advice on what to do. I am wary about calling the police because unless something is actively going on I am pretty sure they can or won't do anything, and that's not the route I'd like to take anyhow. Is there anything I can do? Aside from talking sense into her because that's been quite difficult.


Update:     I had a long talk with both my roomie and her bf. I told them both that what happened that night was insane. They sat together HAND IN HAND and apologized! I stopped K right there. I said ""No, I want the apology from E to me AND YOU and then maybe he can come back if he can prove he's not going to bring trouble into our house"". K actually heard what I was saying and stepped back too, saying the same shit. If E doesn't get his shit together, he isn't welcome back. He will also NOT be here overnight until I feel K is safe.

My connect was getting them consistently starting in March and she liked me so much she'd only sell them to me.  Needless to say I developed quite the habit.  Gotta say those 6 months were bliss.  Fast forward to the end of September and turns out the connect was taken off them, no longer getting a monthly script.  Sure, they still sold plenty blues and 80s but man oh man what a letdown to go back to oxycodone after a half year of the holy grail.  Like it wasn't doing jack.  I know I was spoiled but I actually took the whole situation as a sign to get sober.  

Just before the connect was cut off I saw the first articles on Endo complying with the FDA's request to take Opana off the market.  I was crushed but I still can't wrap my head around how the generics were still on the market... I mean I'd take the G series over the brand name any day and twice on Sundays because they are easier to use.  Anyway I just read an article the other day on how Scott Gottleib, commissioner of the FDA and the one who spoke out against Opana, said they are also reviewing the generics that are still on the market and furthermore said that the generic er form of oxymorphone has the highest abuse rate of any opioid on the market.  

Reading these things just led me to some shower thoughts... To me, this seems to say it's only a matter of time before the G series is pulled as well.  I think they're living on borrowed time.
I truly think we will all look back on Opana and its generic formulations years or decades from now and view the time when it was on the market as the good ol' days.  Future generations will never know what they missed out on, kinda like how young generations right now have no concept of what Quaaludes feel like, we just know it was a legendary drug many ppl loved and abused that is now no longer in production.   

Sorry, musings over.  I haven't had any real opiates since Oct 30, thanks largely to Kratom.  Now I'm getting all anxious about the upcoming FDA decision on that.  Man if they ban it then fuck me I don't know what I'll do.",1513096326.0

Some addicts said their dope addiction started with pills. Enough ppl said it to take notice. The remedy? Educate doctors to monitor and educate  patients, TAPER at the end, and don't treat them like addicts or cut them off  because they've been taking a prescription for six months and are now dependent. Continue the treatment until no longer needed, then TAPER. ( You know, like docs do with antidepressants. But those patients don't get treated like shit, do they?)


BUT NO. The ""drug war"" started cracking down on doctors and pharmacists who started cutting ppl off (esp those who rightfully needed those meds), didn't properly taper and left them on their own. 

Many got their pills from the street. Except, now all these ppl are in possession of ""illegal"" prescriptions, nvm that they need them and we're cut loose from the doc. So the govt/media say ""opioid abuse is on the rise! And crack down ever more, prosecuting doctors who are now terrified to write scripts. This reduces the supply of pills on the Street.

Now those pain patients and weekend drug users have no choice but to get heroin. Guess what happens now? Now they get strung out on dope. 

And the govt/media cry, ""Heroin is an epidemic!""

So many new junkies now that supply can't meet demand. Enter Asian chemical suppliers, dealers who have no possible way of cutting it safely, and WHAM, death after death after death.

The whole while the media is spreading the bullshit putting more pressure on law enforcement, who cause more pressure on the docs/users, whos statistics end up feeding more media bullshit...round and round it goes. 

Buts let's keep demonizing opioids because I'm sure the NEXT cycle won't end up in even more harm and death.

Question about tar.,"Hey guys been browsing through this sub reddit for a couple months but I finally got high enough and had some time alone to make an account i figured I would introduce myself.
I live on the east coast of the United States (I know there are strict rules on location so I’m leaving it at that.) I used to have a moderate heroin addiction, about $100 a day and another $40 or so in coke for speedballs. This was before the widespread fent outbreak. When I was picking up it was usually small rocks that were a tan or creamy beige color. Towards the end it got grey and I think that’s around the time the fentanyl came out because I had 3 overdose scares in a span of 5-6 months. Anyways I’ve only had tar one time and compared to the rocks it suckeddd. I was getting the H through a “plug” that generally only sold larger amounts but I had an in through a lifelong friend who’s been going to this guy for years. He never had tar himself so I am very inexperienced with it. I noticed I’ve seen some people saying they’ve “snorted” tar. Now to me that just seems silly for a couple reasons 1) everyone knows a needle is the ultimate method of delivery based solely on efficiency. 2) how in the fuck do you snort a clump of this almost hash like substance? I’m literally so confused on this.

We figured what the hell and wanted to try shooting one bundle to see what its like right before we stop.

So, the first time I shot up I did it in the vein on my right arm on the opposite side of my elbow (where blood is typically drawn at a doctor or blood drive). About 30 seconds after I started to get crazy light headed and then for about a minute I was getting this CRAZY rush that was also making me kind of light headed. Then I got really hot and really tired but after about five minutes it faded away and then I was just stable high like I snorted a fuck load of bags.

The next two times I did it exactly the same but I didnt feel anything. I know I didnt miss my vein or whatever, it stopped the onset of dope sickness but there was no rush and it just felt like typically snorting 2-3 bags.


SO, here is my question. I have these ""Sleeping Giant"" bags from New England. They are very good bags in size and quality. I wanted to try it one more time and I wanted to guarintee I got this much sought after rush people shoot up for. Here's what I did:

I took a brand new bottle of water, opened it and set the cap upside down. I dumped out THREE bags (which I thought was going to RAIL me). I filled the needle to the 40 marker with the cold water from the bottle and sprayed it onto the powdered dope in the cap. I took the plunger and worked it until it was all dissolved. This time I decided NOT to use a little piece of cotton ball and just sucked up the dope juice straight from the cap. There was no cooking of it, in fact I havent done that any time because from what I've read its just so people can feel like they are killing bacteria and it has no benefit or necessity to shoot up. Instead of my arm I put it into a fat bulging vein on my hand.

After it went into my skin I pulled up a bit to create the suction and saw the blood shoot right into the needle and then pushed it all in. So I took of my belt on my forearm, lit a butt, and sat here waiting for it to kick in. Here's the problem.... AGAIN I got no rush what so ever. After like five minutes here I feel like nodding a bit, my vision is kinda blurry and I'm definately high.... its just like a typical snorting 3-5 bag high. No matter if I did one bag or this time three, I just havent gotten that rush like I did the first time.


Can someone with experience here tell me whats up? Did I get that weird rush experience the first time just because I've never shot up before? Do you not always get a rush? Is the high supposed to be no different then just snorting dope or eating a handful of oxy? On average my girlfriend and I on a bad day split one bundle a day and when we are flushed with cashola have been known to do a half pack between us so like I said I definately have a tollerence. I just want to know if something went wrong or if I'm just an idiot and expecting something that isnt there...

Either way, she goes in tomorrow to actually take the subs for the first time so shes asleep waiting to get sick. I have my bundle for tomorrow when I do my first visit and Friday I'll be going in sick to take my first dose of subs. I don't have any more needles and will just be snorting to get by for the day but by this time tomorrow I'll be hours into starting the sickness.

This guy is either outta his fucking mind ( yes indeed I am ) or he is trolling ( which I'm not ).  I have been using heroin on and off for 5 years. I've withdrawn from 1-2 gram a day habits of tar, ecp, and fentanyl at least a dozen times and smaller habits or short runs at least another hundred. I've also withdrawn off 2mg of Suboxone cold turkey after being on it for 6 months ( I was still using heroin as well ). I've been in the game awhile and trust me, I know what TRUE pain from withdrawal feels like. I once detoxed in my car, in the dead of winter, after a gram a day ecp/fentanyl and it was the second worse week of my life. But in all my years of cold turkey heroin withdrawal, I have NEVER felt as worse as I have felt the past week coming off of gabapentin.

.         . I cold turkeyed off gabapentin 9 days ago after using 90, 300mg pills in under 13 days. The dosages weren't very consistent but that breaks out to 2,700 mg a day over the course of this binge. I was using the Gabapentin following a 3 month heroin bender, followed by 4 days of Suboxone, and 5 days of Kratom. So I thought hey, I'll just take Gabapentin and clonodine at the end of this fucked up detox plan of mine, stop the GaBa and clonodine, and I'll be cool. Well, it didn't really work out like. I also took about 1-2 mg of Xanax the final 4 days of using the Gabapentin. So maybe that had a lot to do with how horrible my withdrawal symptoms are. 

.       .So 9 days ago I stopped the GaBa and 4 days of Xanax cold turkey. I know it's not advised to abruptly stop taking both of these drugs but I really didn't have much of a choice. I blew threw my gaba script so fast my doctor wouldnt prescribe me anymore and my sister was all out of Xanax. I will never forget that Tuesday morning for as long as I live. 

.      .My symptoms include...
.       Skin crawling, nerve pain, intense burning throughout my entire body, brain zaps, an electrical forcefield that keeps shocking my whole body, Hot flashes/chills, migraine, diarrhea, nausea, depression, suicidal thoughts, vertigo, ringing in ears, fatigue, insomnia, anxiety, heart palpitations, restlessness, speech and hearing impairment, and other symptoms I'm probably forgetting. 

.        . It has been 9 long and excruciatingly painful days and all the symptoms are still here!!! I have read countless of forums where people have been withdrawaling from this shit for a few months to a year and some people's symptoms NEVER go away. I really fucked up big this time , I feel like I really fried my brain with this one. Maybe it was a bad interaction with Xanax that made this so bad for me who knows. But I can honestly say the electrical forcefield which is running through my body is the most unpleasant sensation I have ever felt. Like it feels like I am on a bed of nails when laying, and I have a 3rd degree sunburn when I'm standing or sitting. I have never felt the constant sensation of nerve pain, burning, and torturous brain zaps before and it's making me long for the days of coming off heroin. I'll probably have to endure it for at least another month or two it looks like . Thats why I think this shit is worse than heroin, it's not exactly the severity of the symptoms it's the duration. Like 9 days later and I feel like I am getting worse and worse everyday.  I hope this shit clears up soon cause I swear to God I'm gonna put a fucking bullet in my head before New Year's.

Please read.,"So I've been doing this white powder im assuming was fent, Did a lot of it over the course of 2-3 weeks. I only snort or smoke. Dope boy ran out of it, So I was just gonna try to kick using suboxone. I did my last line of white shit around 5 AM Saturday night and woke up around 5 pm on Sunday. I didn't feel too bad but I assumed I had been doing fent so I thought I'd definitely be good to dose the sub. At 5:17 PM Sunday I probably had no more than one milligram of sub, And by 5:20 I was feeling the sweat coming from my pores on my face and back while on the toilet shitting my brains out. I think this happened not because I dosed too soon, But the white shit had skyrocketed my tolerance to a level subs couldn't deal with so it sent it crashing down.


Around two hours later I tried to dose more sub to help but it did the opposite. I was in awful pain for around 6 hours until I just went and copped regular dope and got very minimal relief. For the next 48 hours I might have gotten four hours of sleep, took dozens of hot baths to stop my legs from aching. No amount of dope gave me any relief besides maybe 30 minutes of restful legs or a tingling sensation in my head & back, Not high whatsoever.


It's now been 75 hours since I dosed the sub, And the dope boy has the batch back in. Everybody else can get high and got high when it was just regular dope, But all I'll get is a tingling sensation and my legs will relax a bit. What is happening to me? Did I fuck up my brain or body to where I can't get high anymore? Has anyone else dealt with something similar? Any experiences or possible explanation would be greatly appreciated.

He Most Likely Didn't Have 6 opiates in his System,"I am working on dispelling the people who claim Lil Peep had a huge drug habit and that he had 6 opiates in his system. I believe they are misanalyzing the toxicology report. Please correct me if I am wrong:

It is my mission to dispell the notion that he had 6 opiates in his system, because he didnt, he had two opiates and a ""non narcotic"" opioid that is weaker than codeine.

The metabolites Hydrocodone and Hydromorphine came from taking Norco aka Hydrocodone. When you take Hydrocodone it shows up in your urine as Hydrocodone and Hydromorphone. The same goes for the Oxycodone and Oxymorphone. When you take Oxycodone (roxi's/Blues/30's, Percocet) the metabolites Oxycodone and Oxymorphone show up in your urine.

So in reality, he only took Hydrocodone, Oxycodone and Tramadol. Since they were in his urine and not his blood, they could of been taken the 24 or more hours before because it doesn't leave your blood for 24 hours and stays in your urine for 3 days. So he could of taken them up to 3 days before but definitely not in the 24 hours before he died.

The only ACTIVE drugs he had in his system that he had taken the day of his death was Xanax, Weed, Cocaine and the fake Oxy that had the fentanyl in it. The weed and Cocaine aren't a big deal but the Xanax and Fentanyl are what killed him. If the roxi's had been legit he would still be alive.

The fact that he said he only took 60mg of roxi and THOUGHT that was how much he took, leads me to believe he didn't have a huge habit. I know people who can literally blow through 120mg of Oxy, which is 4 30mg roxi's, he only took two of what he thought was Oxy and it killed him because it was fentanyl.

Yes Peep had a serious drug habit, but his death was an accident due to fentanyl, if Fentanyl was not involved he would still be alive. ",1513208045.0

Some background info: My SO and I have been together for 3+ years. He has a long history of opioid addiction (heroin + an extensive list of prescriptions) due to his chronic pain. He's been weaning off of methadone for the past few years, currently on 10mg down from 200, which I'm so proud of him for. 

He's a great person and all other aspects of our relationship are healthy. However, our sex life has been pretty much non existent because of the constant mild-moderate withdrawal (understandably). We have sex maybe once every few months which is shitty for me. I'm really hoping that things become more normal after he quits but I'm worried that will be another long while since methadone withdrawal is soooo fucking long. 

Has anyone else had experience with this? If so, how long after quitting did you notice your sex drive returning? ",1513195604.0

People went mad when Lil' Peep died. Weird.
So, these people have to go through such a hassle to get CODEINE. Fuck. Codeine. 300mg, when I had no tolerance, would make me nothing but itchy. Made me mad, that's what it did. So I found a way into opiates by searching online for sources and ta-dah, I found out that we have OTC Morphine. It's like Laudanum, and it costs approximately 5 dollars for 15mg. Totally IV'able when managed correctly.
Some time ago I ended up becoming a dope feen (totally expected, as I had problems with coke in the past) in a big city, so it was no problem getting a fix unless I was out of money. So I went out of money. Had to go back to a small city where I used to live as a teenager and, as my parents found out, they forced me to go to rehab, where I spent six months along with 90 male crack smokers and coke addicts. No one knew morphine or heroin (which I love btw).
I went out and I thought I would control it. Bullshit. Two months later, here I am again: everyday user, but at least got my tolly down. I can nod off at 45mg doses + 2mg kpin, and I've got a good amount of money to spend but ALL THE PHARMACIES ARE OUT OF STOCK. And they probably won't have it for some time. Fuck.
I went into every single pharmacy asking for it and they all told me the med would stop being sent here for no reason, and I guess the reason is me. I bought, for a straight month, 3 bottles of 15mg a day and each pharmacy has, normally, 1. People even started recognizing me and I hadn't had to ask for it, they'd just say ""the same?"" ""yes, the same"". Now...if I gave them my identity, I would get discount, and that's what I did. Think the distributor noticed it and decided to take a break so people wouldn't find out there's such a powerful OTC drug being sold as if it was aspirin.
Now I'm going through mild withdrawals and waiting for some buprenorphine I asked for 2 or 3 weeks ago, which should be arriving soon. 
Think of someone who's pissed off. That's me. Just wanted to share.

Did enough to break through the ~4mg suboxone I was on. Today no withdrawal symptoms, yet I've done none.

A week ago I would have woken up sick. And every 4-6 hours. This lull in withdrawal symptoms makes the junkie in my head think ""Hey, you've got it beat. You can just keep doing this. Maybe you'll never feel withdrawal again! You broke yourself, good job buddy, now go score that fat sack of heroin adn another one and another one and another one and another one...."" but smart me knows that's bullshit. Just in that little bit of time my physical addiction has lessened to such an extent that I don't need it every second of every day. And I'm already induced on kinda-low-dose suboxone (I REFUSE to high-dose). It'll probably be another 12-20 hours before I lose appetite, get broken sleep , runny nose and all that back. I was actually up to about 3 hours a night after those 6 days.. but last night only woke up once to smash some pepperoni cheese and crackers, smoke a cig and go back to bed.

Anyway, this is a shitpost, just trying to write it out and remind myself that though the devil may tempt me, using this lull as an invitation back into active addiction, really, it's a foreshadowing of the freedom yet to come.

If you're going through it in the beginning, keep going. If you're hating the cycle of active addiction and grinding every day for your next fix... give yourself a break. Maybe try 2 days off over a weekend, then go on for one day, then 2 days off, etc... Every single day you go through the pain you get better.

Working on your feet in the deepest throws of WD is a tour of hell.

Historically, I usually (oxy) wd on night one with no sleep but it's expected. With lope I can usually coax out a few hours sleep the next day and with in 3-4 days am doing really well.

*historically* that was. PAST tense. I guess I'm *still* being effected by the opana because I didn't sleep for 3 nights. I was ready to declare myself clean but sleep just would not come.

The first night my back hurt so back it felt broken but by the next day that was over with. Even the lethargy was starting to ebb somewhat but the mental toll that not sleeping was too much to bear and I managed to cop 45mg oxy and slept for 9 hours. 

I didn't really want to fuck up that run but without benzos or anything else to help I just couldn't swing it any longer and still function.

I then went in monday for a after hospital checkup/went ahead and got next months script.  Well he urine tested me out of nowhere (was my first one ever).  Would one 5 mg pill on sunday morning even show up on the test? I assume that's what he is looking for.

It's been over 3 weeks now and I haven't heard from him by mail or phone but I can't help but worry that I may get ""fired"" for something completely out of my control. I also feel like that was an extremely weird time to urine test me.

(NOT MEDICAL ADVICE),"**Short term because long-term use of high doses of loperamide have been known to cause heart problems and result in death from cardiac issues. This is not to be taken as medical advice or as anything other than a method used by the author of this post, and the safety thereof is not guaranteed.**

This is what I have done to make withdrawal tolerable in the past. Keep in mind the timing of this is very important.  

1. Take two cimetidine (Tagamet).

2. Wait one hour. Do not try to cheat this hour. You can wait longer than an hour but you must wait at least one hour. You must take tagamet one hour before every dose of loperamide. 

3. These are the instructions for a taper. Day 1-60-80mg loperamide depending on your tolerance. Day 2- 40-60mg. Day 3 40-50mg. Day 4-30-40mg. Day 5 20-30mg. Day 6-15-20. Day 7- 10-15. Day 8- 5-10mg. (Day 9 if you need it, 5mg only, or 0 if you'v been doing the lower doses.) 

4. Feel free to speed this up but don't use this any longer than suggested.

This is not medical advice and this is to be undertaken at ones own risk. Anecdotally, I haven't had any problems from doing this whenever I want to clean up for a little while, and I feel around 90% normal for most of the taper. Add some gabapentin if you still have trouble sleeping and you can come out of some pretty nasty habits without feeling like crap or going on maintenance drugs. This won't get you high at these doses but it will keep you from feeling shitty. Literally as well as figuratively. Also, while doing this, eat lots of fruits and vegetables. Just saying.

Obviously snorting is considered abuse by doctors and they don't care much for that, so why in the hell would this stuff be prescribed at all? If you were taking it as directed, you would need a lot of it just to match taking oxycodone, so what is the point?

They probably wouldn't have cared but I slacked off and never picked it up, never got my final tests. So for the past 6 months or so I haven't known my status. 

Doc insisted on getting an answer to that question this week. Turns out I am Hep C free.

I was battling benzo addiction at the time and going through a taper which i recently finished about 6 days ago. 

I am now waking up extremely nauseous and throwing up, i can't eat, im swarmed with anxiety, i don't feel there mentally at all, I have aches and pains everywhere. Please refrain from shitting on me i understand how foolish it was to do this and i know what suboxone is meant for but I'm at a complete loss as to what to do from here. I just want off them and to continue my life but i am scared they are now turning on me and completely shutting down my body or maybe i am just dealing with acute/post withdrawl from the valium. What is going on???? I started at 2mg of suboxone and now on 4mg through a months time and i am so scared. I was so happy to be off benzos but now im so upset at myself because all i wanted was to be sober but was stupid and self sabotaged with my addict mind.",1513294159.0

I hate what I’ve become. Constantly being secretive, burning through all my money, killing myself. So today I quit. This is my last day. Any advice from you guys on how to ease this WD would be really helpful. I don’t know what to expect. I’ve WD once and It was awful but that was over 6 months ago. I did it cold turkey and snapped on day 6.

I decide this today because Recently I’ve been seeing a lot of posts on here and people wanting to try it for the first time and asking how to score. It sickens me. So many of you guys out there are so caring and offer the best advice and they shut it down and just want to ruin there lives. If I could go back I would never take that first hit.

Today I had the complete opposite happen. As usual I rolled up, he ran out, switched out dope and money, and I drove off. Once I’m down the street a ways I pulled the bag out to take a look at my glorious new fat ass bag of dope. It was pretty obvious that he gave me a fuck-ton more dope than what I paid for. I was already running late from my lunch break so I booked it back to work. Once I get back I run in to go and lock myself in the bathroom to boot shit (booT not booF, just to make sure lol). I cut out the average amount I need to get a solid high and rush but noticed that it mixed down a lot darker than usual so I figured, since it was his bag, that it hadn’t been cut. Holy fuck am I glad that I took a test shot because if I hadn’t, I guarantee that I would have OD’d and died right there (which also showed me just how much he cuts it which is a lot more than I thought jeez). Either way, I end up getting him on the phone and letting him know about his fuck up (which he had just noticed himself lol). So I’m about to roll back out there and give him his shit back and get the bag I paid for. Hopefully he’ll hook me up since I told him and I’m bringing it back (which I assume a lot of junkies wouldn’t). I guess this is one way to get on the dboy’s good graces lol. Oh, and btw, the bag he gave me was about 2 grams so it wasn’t a ridiculous amount and I could totally understand the fuck up.

He's been a smoker with cigarettes and weed since before I met him. I tolerate that in the backyard. But I thought it was just that.



The other day I found text messages on his phone about buying oxy and we discussed opiates. We agreed he wouldn't buy any oxy (whether he has been buying oxy or any other opiates previously I don't know. He has stolen money from me at least once) but I fear that he just 'agreed' to shut me up. 


So I researched like symptoms of doing opiates so I could see if my son had displayed any of these behaviours. Now bear in mind my uninformed-ness as I do not do drugs so I don't know how i'll come off.



Well the Google said that nausea was one symptom and I remember my son was on the toilet for ages yesterday and then threw up. He said it was nothing and that it was just one of those days. However I read that constipation is another symptom and it seemed he was constipated as he was on the toilet for like over an hour. 



Today he asked me for $20 for 'lunch money' but the thing is that he has an eating disorder he developed from previous abuse and never in all the time i've known him have I ever seen him voluntarily eat something. Usually I have to spend a great amount of energy to get him to take a bite or I have to blend it up and make him drink it. So it doesn't make sense he would ask for lunch money when he never eats. 



I don't know. I need to know if he is doing these substances but the drug messages are all cleared on his phone. Is that another red flag? What should I do? ",1513267473.0

But my fucking god the CWEs have seemingly become worse and worse tasting over time. I can genuinely say a Codeine CWE is at present one of the most *disgusting* things I've drunk (probably due to continuously negatively anticipating it).

I understand the bio availability of morphine is really low. And that IVing or boofing is the best way to go.

How much should I smoke to get a buzz? One whole 60 mg pill?

I always thought the drug world was hard to get into, and that drug dealers operated stealthily and you needed lots of street knowledge and charm to find drugs, but this afternoon I leaned out my car window and asked there first homeless person I saw where I could get heroin, and they walked me two blocks and hooked me up with a dealer. I didn't have to pay anyone up front, or let someone walk with my money, or wait around for hours, or anything. Just leaned out my window and asked for heroin and 20 minutes later I had some.

Some context. I'm a chipper, I use maybe twice a month and have for a few years now. Oddly enough I've never had to actually buy dope in person. I've just asked my friends if they could get me some next time they went to cop and they did. It was easy, and I knew I was getting decent enough stuff and that it wasn't cut with fent or rat poison or uranium or whatever it is people are cutting heroin with these days. Then a few years ago I moved, and the girl I moved in with bought everything off the darknet, so that's what I started doing too. Well for anyone who hasn't been paying attention the darknet, and the currencies that go along with it, are batshit fucking insane right now, and I haven't been able to use them. And since I've moved around in the last few years that means if I wanted to get drugs I'd have to do it the ol' fashioned way.

And holy shit, I wish I had just done this from the beginning.

I had no idea what prices are in my area, but online it's anywhere from 110-350 a gram for heroin, plus shipping and transaction fees and maybe a P.O. Box, and stuff like that. Realistically it costs $160 for me to get drugs, and then I have to wait a little bit, and might not even get quality stuff if i get anything at all.

So today I was on my way home and stopped at a red light and a homeless guy was panhandling in an area that, while not exactly seedy, isn't particularly nice either. I hadn't done heroin in over a month so I rolled down my window, gave him $5 and asked.

""Hey you know where I can get any dope around here?""
*laughing* ""Ya I think I do, pull over around the corner and I'll show you""

So I parked and we talked, and told him I'd give him $10 if he could hook me up with a dealer and get me their number. We walked a few blocks, knocked on the door of this guys motor home that was parked literally across the street from my gym. The guy inside asked what we needed, told me it was $80 a g or $150 for 2. Sold me my drugs and I left. I took the homeless guy to mcdonalds for a burger and we talked a little bit about the scene around there (which is apparently huge) and that was the end of that. I can't believe I've been paying double, for the same quality stuff, and waiting around for it to get mailed to me when all I had to do was yell ""Can someone should me where I can buy some heroin"" and get some 20 minutes later.",1513400161.0

But fuck. Fuckitty fuck. Like that was a huge step for me. Scoring that job was indirectly saving my ass, and then I try walking on pavement on a cold night, slip, and fuck it all up. The part that gets me is I didn't even do anything wrong. Usually when I lose something good it's because I blatantly made a series of wrong and terrible decisions but I didn't this time. I was literally just walking, toddling about like a young IV drug fiend who recently discovered this new thing called Hope, because legal hustle ya know? Then I slipped on it. Literally. 

I can't get a job for a few months at least. I've been somehow, someway making ends meet without revenue for awhile, but it's difficult day to day living with risks of death or felony charges that I can't keep doing. I was on the way out of that street shit and I fucked it up, and not even in my usual junkie or tweaker way of fucking things up, it was through simple misfortune, a bad roll of the dice. I'm innocent in this and it feels strange. 

First and only paycheck comes next week. Plan is to buy bulk meth or h, do a few flips, then buy bulk of whichever of the two I didn't start with and be on for both. It's almost what I was doing before this job, just more structured, consistent, and more money. 

As I read over the above paragraph I feel about as reasonable and logical as soggy cereal. I don't know what else to do, working the resources of all the illegal shit that makes up the drug scene is what I know best but I'm fucking tired of it. I had a way out but now it's gone, and I don't know what to do. If anyone can throw some ideas out there please do so. The check will be between 200-300 dollars, and I have to at least double that in two weeks maximum. If I have to keep doing illegal street shit to do so then so be it, but I really really prefer not to.",1513381093.0

Story time in the text.,"So my roommate, let's call him Brad. Fucking Brad. Back story: he used to be my middle man until he went homeless. My landlord (who is also my roommate) pitted him and allows him to sleep in his van in our front yard without paying for anything when our electric bill is sky high this winter. That's a rant for another day. Anyway, before he went homeless, he was an okay middle man when I couldn't go through my main d-boy. But the first time I went through him after he moved out of his room, he seriously pinched my bag. The second time the weight was good, but he went to the bathroom for a bit before handing it off to me and he seriously cut it so much that I barely got any dope out of the deal. I was basically robbed for the $20. Oh well, lesson learned, I haven't went through him since he robbed my bag. For the past month he's been texting me that he's hurting and needing my business. Nope, fuck you. I used to be the nice person that even if I wasn't going through him, I'd throw him a dub because I don't like seeing people sick. But after you fuck me over too much, it's time to cut you off from my generosity. 

Anyway, my SO cleans his weed pipe regularly and he had a ball of rising from the weed sitting on our desk. It looks like a G of BTH. 

When I came home, the ball of risin was gone. Fucking Brad took it probably thinking it was dope. I love thinking about how he was all excited to get over on me once more, break off a piece to roll it down the foil to only find it was weed risin. Hehe. 

Anyway, that was my story. I've helped Brad out so much when he didn't have much because I'm a girl and I make pretty good money. Smokes. Cigs. If he wasn't middling for me and sick, I'd break him off a piece from my main guy for free. But I got tired of him taking advantage of my  generosity and thinking he could fuck with me so much. I'd give so much to him but if I ever had for a ride or even use his fucking scale for a few mins, he'd always want something in return. 

He was supposed to be gone Thanksgiving and now it's almost Christmas. 


I honestly never wish bad towards my fellow earthlings. Even if they're shitty. I honestly wish him the best and I hope he gets his shit together. But I just love it, him stealing from me and having his excitement die instantly is enough karma for me.


Idk. I thought maybe you guys would enjoy the random story. If it's just a shitty shit post, I'll delete it.

I worked my way up to 16mgs of Subutex to get relief and even though ""less is more"" I would experience horrible WD's when trying to taper down, I also experienced some pretty odd side effects that the clinic themselves said they had never heard of. Over the past 3 days the doctors have increased my Methadone dose from 15mgs to 25mgs which I'm cautious about doing. I've read some pretty horrible things about methadone so switching programs was an absolute last resort for me. When I found out that I could still take hydros with the Subutex for pain and they worked exceptionally well, I decided that was enough out of fear that I would start using the Subutex for breaks instead of actually using it for permanent recovery.

This is my first time on methadone so any and all info would be great. I don't want to be married to this medication but I don't want to quit prematurely and relapse. Do any of you have experience with Vitadone for regularity? If so how well does it work and would you suggest something else? What should I expect from long term use of methadone? (Everyone is different I know)

I'm trying to approach this with caution as I don't want it to escalate out of control and I don't want to be married to this drug for the rest of my life. 

The clinic actually has a list of methadone potentiators which I found odd, and a list of medications to stay away from while on it.

What would you suggest to get the most out of it?

What would you suggest to stay regular & healthy while on it?

What are your experiences from methadone use?

How would you rate these experiences?

I've known about 20 people who have died from this but no one I was really close with. I knew it was only a matter of time. I posted about my friend last December when he got arrested for robbing a pharmacy in a xanax black out. He had a ton of priors for possession and prescription forgery so I thought for sure he was gonna get 10-20 years in prison for the robbery. Well it turns out he only used a note for the robbery and somehow he did 6 months in jail then got sent to a 2 year in patient rehab. His parents are rich and his brother is a detective so that probably helped.

Everything was going fine with him at the rehab, he talked to me a few times when he was able to sneak some calls. I come home from work and my mom tells me to sit down and said I need to talk to you about Patrick. I knew immediately what she was gonna say. She was just looking g online at obituaries and happened to see his.

His parents blame me and his other friends(me more though) for his death so I couldn't even attend his funeral. I found out that he was found at the rehab dead from an OD. He had told his parents all these lies about how I turned him into a heroin addict. The truth is he was the first person to ever give me an opiate. We did start using dope together back in 05 but I NEVER EVER forced or pressured him into anything. He jumped at the chance to try heroin and shoot it too, which is something I told him not to do. I'm not an IV user either.

Anyway I just had to get this off my chest. Some of you might have actually known him. He was on here a couple years ago but I can't remember his username.

Saw doctor today and he changed the prescription to #130 5 mg oxycodone 1 every 6 hours may increase to 1 1/2 for severe pain. He also wrote May fill 12/16/2017. He's 100% okay with me filling it early, I flat out asked him.

I tried a pharmacy on the way home but they said they wouldn't fill it because ""they werent sure if they should put 1 pill every 6 hours or 1 1/2 pill every 6 hours and won't fill it until the 20th"", but it wasn't the one I usually go to so they might have just wanted to get rid of me.  I can try my usual pharmacy tomorrow I guess.

Anyways, to the subject. I can get Kpins pretty easily, but I really don't know general prices for the Teva 1mgs.  The internet tells me 2-3$ a piece? I'd like to trade some for some oxy so I want to know what's fair.

Also, I know benzos and dope are a big combo with people. People feel the same way about Kpins and oxy? I mean I mix em but I can't say it does a whole lot for me other than make me fall asleep faster. I almost feel like it diminishes my oxy high. Be safe everyone.

So when I quit using opiates, I got a really serious case of pink cloud. The pink cloud was super useful in staying positive and motivated in the face of PAWS and having to deal with being sober living again.

I started using kratom extracts to help with a very busy time at my job, but now that the time has passed, I want to quit using extracts and go back to complete sobriety, this time for good.

I was just wondering if anyone has any experience quitting extracts and if you experienced a similar pink cloud in the aftermath. I have quit kratom powder before after 1-2 years of using, and I don't remember any such feeling. But that may be because I wasn't familiar with the concept back then. Also, the extracts are considerably more potent, so the wd and aftereffects will probably be more exaggerated.

I might ask in the  kratom sub reddit, but figured I would post it here first as r opiates is probably more familiar with the pink cloud concept and how it compares to kicking kratom. ",1513508438.0

Also 4 days clean of H.,"I finished school not long ago. Got an alright paying job, but the pay sent my dope consumption out of control. I finally got smart, set an appointment with an addiction specialist and got put on subs the same day.

Day 0) Saw doc. Get script. Go home, sleep a few hours, go to work and wait for the withdrawals to start...

Night 0) I really was afraid of PWD, and probably waited much longer than I needed to before dosing my daily 8mg. My nose was running like a firehose, constant cold/hot, shaking, anxious, tense, muscle spasms... I was pacing around my work like I was going mad (thankfully I was alone at the office.) When I decided the time to dose had come I stuck it under my tongue and just an hour later, I began to see what feeling normal was like again.

Day 1) I work overnights, my days/nights are backwards from the rest of the world. Continuing from Night 1, I get home at 8am and eventually get to sleep at 11am. I'm still craving pretty bad at this point but I'm not physically withdrawing. I wake up 5 hours later absolutely covered in sweat, bed sheets stuck to me.

Day 2) My dealer figures out something is up as I typically drop by every day. Blowing my phone up probably thinking I found a new dealer saying shit I know isn't true like ""got some new stuff"" ""got a great deal for u $60 4 $100."" I tell him I'm quitting. He says he won't try to contact me. I know it's not true and block his number anyways.

Day 3) The mental cravings are significantly less now. I've been logging my dose times and slowly pushing it back 1-2 hours each day to get to the point where I'm taking it when I *should* be waking up on most days. My day 1 dose was at 6am while at work, and I won't typically be up at 6am on days off. I'm closing in on my goal time.

Day 4) Went with family to my college graduation today. Shook hands with a few of my favorite professors whom I hadn't been sober for in class for the last 5 semesters. 

Day 5) We'll see when I wake up.

**this chat is not affiliated with this subreddit or its moderators, and has its own moderators, rules, and etiquette. if you feel someone there has slighted you take it up with the moderators of tinychat, as it is completely unaffiliated with and not endorsed by this or any other subreddit.**  

rules:  
1. pick a unique username. this is to protect other users so we know who is who, given the nature of the sort of activities we enjoy.  

2. no lurking. again, to protect the other users. if you come in the room be prepared to introduce yourself and participate for at least a few minutes so we know you're not up to any shenanigans. if you are lurking you will be warned and then given a generous ten minutes to announce yourself. if the time runs out, you will be kicked (not banned) until you are ready to come in and actually participate. if you are a known member whose identity can be confirmed, this rule is not applicable.  

3. no -isms or hate speech, even accidental. one warning will be issued, any continued insistence on such behavior will result in a ban. bans can be contested by pm'ing a moderator (me). this includes but is not limited to racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia. for example, if you are not black, use of the n-word, even with the -a ending, will not be tolerated. i don't care if your friend down the block lets you say it, it's not your lane.  

4. no auditory fuckery. due to peculiarities of the transmission of sound over a chat, certain echos and effects can be amplified to the point of being severely distressing. if it is determined that your end is causing an echo you will be asked to use headphones, or to mute your microphone when not speaking. deliberately making strange or unpleasant noises to annoy other chatters will not be tolerated, and your broadcast will be closed. (this only means that your video/audio feed will be terminated--you will still be allowed to type. this appears to be less of a problem with the new chat app.)

I was about 2 minutes from my destination when flashing lights out of nowhere. I was coming up to a fork in the road where you either had to turn left or right, and I made a left and pulled over. 

Cop comes up to my window and the first thing he says is ""Have you ever been arrested?"" Gulp. I tell him yes, for possession. (My case was dismissed tho, so I'm freaking out that I'm in trouble again). Even though I had nothing in the car, I was scared that I might have forgotten some baggie under the seat. 

So the cop gets my liscence only and pulls me out of the car and says to place my hands... On the trunk. I for sure thought he would say behind my back. He asked me if I knew why he pulled me over and I honestly had no idea. It was for my ""registration light"", or the light above my liscence plate being burned out. 

This really seemed like a formality as they really did not care about my stupid light bulbs. The cop proceeded to grill me asking my name (thinking I would lie), why I was in this area when I live far, when's the last time I used, inisiting I was coming here to ""buy"".  He asked me if I would allow a search of my car, I said yes not feeling like I had a choice, and the other cop proceeded to look all through my shit, including taking all my cards out of my wallet...?

The interrogation continued. Where do you score from? Is it a house? A hotel? Does he have a name? What does his car look like? 

I basically gave them bullshit answers, telling them about the car and name of this guy who sold me Comino (spices) for $50. Lol. But I don't tell them anything that I'm sure they don't already know. These cops were mad. They kept asking if I had anything in the car, and they really thought I did.

Since they found nothing, they told me to GTFO and fix my light. I was so relieved to drive away. I have since fixed my liscence plate light, and encourage anyone who drives to check theirs. 

But I was shooken up. I felt like I was being interrogated when I technically had done nothing wrong, at least drug related. Other than being white in a high traffic area. I really dislike how they lead with making me think I would be arrested, then they ask ""Are you alright?"" When I appear nervous. Of course people are nervous in that situation! 

The cops almost left without giving me back my I.D. They must have really cared about my registration as they never even looked at it. 

I'm rambling at this point, so the tldr is please check the little things on your car that can get you pulled over. You might be the safest driver who is always sober and never speeds, but get pulled over for something small like I did. ",1513486410.0

Through that progression I had struggles and would have given anything to be my old self.  I lost my future, my friends, and the love of my life. Of course, I would take that all of back if I could but that has passed. I eventually had a year clean and found a spiritual awakening. That had wiped my slate clean and refreshed me to a point of peace. But at the same time it showed me life in a perspective which I wasn’t sure how to handle. Sobriety was dull and beautiful at the same time. 

Everything had become meaningless which freed me but had also troubled me. It’s so difficult to try to progress in society when you ask the question, “why?,” with every action. In the end I don’t know what I’m looking for, and that will likely never change as long as I try to fill some void.

Since I’ve relapsed after that, I haven’t felt the desperation that I once used to. Im not longing for the same fairy tale lifestyle that I once did. I’m just doing what I do. It might not be much, but it is something. Maybe I need that purpose, or maybe I just need a girl idk. However at the same time, I’m not sure any of these are more than an illusion to keep me chasing a wild goose.

So my question is: Do you feel like even though with everything sobriety has to offer, you’d rather stay with this lifestyle? Given all of the pain and struggle, it still gives life purpose. In the end, that’s what life will always be. At least in this way of life you have something to live for, even if you may die for it. The grand scheme of things weighs on me too much to put too much worry into everything that people waste lives worrying about.",1513485673.0

Therefore, aside from what I like to tell myself, I know the potential for addiction is always there.

I have used oxycodone on occasion over the past two years, maybe once every 2-3 months or so. I really enjoy the warm, euphoric high it produces, but never felt the urge to take it more often than that.

Until recently. In the past few weeks I have had access to pharmaceutical grade morphine. I smoked heroin about five years ago and always wanted to try the IV route, but was afraid due to impurities etc. In the past two weeks I have taken 5-10mg of IM morphine on three separate occasions. I said I would try it just the once, but the opportunity kept presenting itself to me. I also took 20mg of Oxycontin with the last hit of morphine, it was bliss.

I have browsed this sub for a long time and have seen how people fall down the opiate hole. I can see how this could potentially happen to me, and am basically looking for some insight into how I can stop this. The morphine is 100% pharmaceutical grade so no chance of it being cut with fentanyl or anything like that. I do not want to end up an opiate addict. Any advice would be much appreciated, thank you",1513601510.0

Ive been trying to come up with a plan to successfully smoke tar out of a blunt. I’ve done a lot of digging on the matter but I haven’t found any conclusive techniques for it. Everything I’ve read claims that weed burns too hot for H, and that the weed will burn too hot for the H. As of lately I’ve been using a blunt wrap as a tooter and letting  the residue collect on the blunt. I have yet to try it, I have so far smoked 2 Gs using the papers and I’m pretty optimistic on how this will turn out. I know I haven’t solved the issue of weed burning too hot but I feel a lot more comfortable wasting the residue on my blunt then by dropping a Gs worth and mixing it in the blunt. I’ll come back and update this when I get the chance to spark it up.

Used to come on in active w/d’s and stare longingly at the other addicts like myself who were high. Used to read stories from people just like me, so I wouldn’t feel alone. Used to start detox threads for moral support, only to inevitably use shortly after. I want to share with you guys/gals my story. A shortened version.

My background before drugs isn’t important IMO. Started off with blues in college, and eventually transitioned to IV heroin. Same song and dance. First stint in rehab at age 22. From 22 to 26 I would do 8 more rehab stays throughout 3 different states. Never making it more than a month after I got out. In the beginning it was so fun. The risk, the feeling, the danger.... I chased it. And when I caught it, I prepared to chase it some more. My life was consumed, as we all know. I firmly believe that there are two types of addicts. Those who can keep people at bay for a time and carry on with their lives hiding their secret until an eventual (and inevitable) catastrophic implosion. And those who cannot. I started as the first and ended as the latter. I eventually could not hide it. I slept all day, barely ate, and eventually withered away to a shell of a human being that I didn’t know. After about 2 years (give or take) the drugs stopped being fun. My tolerance sky-rocketed, and even with east coast dope (won’t give away my location but notoriously has the strongest powdered heroin in the country) I was struggling to walk the line of getting high and not overdosing. Age 22-had my first OD. 2 more would follow. One of which I was hit with Narcan 3 times, because the first 2 didn’t work. But I kept using. Eventually, like so many people reading this, I lost hope. I lost hope that my life would ever have any real value beyond wake-scheme-cop-sleep...rinse wash repeat. The happiness I once remembered (true happiness) was depleted and far away it felt like an insurmountable journey across a barren sea. I tapped out, and my whole world became a room, a car ride, and a few cycling names that would facilitate my addiction. A cyclical hell...rinse wash repeat. 

Eventually, I ended up in a different state for treatment. Same old story, said all the right things, got out with good intentions and feeling better, met a girl, and you all know the rest... relapse. But something would change the course of my life this time. A child. The girl I met was in recovery too, and got pregnant. And all of the sudden we had to make a life-altering choice. Now, I know what some people are thinking. “Two kids early on in recovery is a disaster waiting to happen, should’ve had an abortion.” And you’re right about the first part. It was a disaster (in the long run). Ultimately, we decided to have the child. I won’t lie, my life didn’t immediately get better. In fact, it got worse for a time. I used off and on during her pregnancy. I’m not proud of it, and In fact I’m down right ashamed but I can’t change that now. I have learned to accept that’s who i was.

About 4 years ago my daughter was born. Slightly before that happened I was at a crossroads in my life. Here’s where my story gets important. One day, after a huge fight with my daughters mother, I realized something. At so many points in my life being clean or off H didn’t seem worth it, and now it all of the sudden did. I realized that either my daughter would be removed from life forever (rightfully so), or I would have to get my act together. I envisioned a life filled with doing what I’d been doing for 4 years, or a life filled with being a parent. Being someone that has purpose. My child gave me purpose. Now I’m not saying having a kid is what you should be doing, or that kids alone can keep you off the smack. They can’t. But for me, it was enough to push me in the right direction, instead of the opposite. I chose suboxone maintenance as opposed to rehab to try something new, and never looked back. Right before my daughter was born was the last time I used H. 

Fast forward 4 years to now... I got a job in healthcare, ironically in an ER. Can you guess what I do? Well for starters, I take care of Overdose patients. Those same patients who were once me. I help nurses administer the very same narcotics that once controlled my every movement. Dilaudid, morph, fent....It was weird at first, but now I don’t even think twice about it. The important thing is, I built a life for myself. A real life that, for the first time since I started using, was better than using. A life that makes it worth it, good days and bad days alike. A little person who gives me purpose and calls me “daddy” was a big part of it, but not ALL of it. 

I also got back in college to finish up, a few months after I started sub maintenance. I had planned on just finishing and going right back to work. I got interested in science... and working in health care was kind of just a catalyst for my eventual interest in medicine as a career. One thing led to another and I began pursuing medical school. 2 months ago I was officially accepted to my top choice out on the west coast. My goal is to become a surgeon.  

I don’t say that to gloat. I hope people don’t get a high horse vibe. I don’t think I’m better than anyone here. I say it to [hopefully] give some of you guys/gals hope. A lot of people on here talk about how shitty recovery can be. And they’re right. It downright sucks the D in the beginning. There’s no doubt. But give it TIME. Time is so so so important and as addicts...we hate it. We want immediate gratification. Everything has to feel good right away. Right? But keep pushing through. Nothing ever came easily that was really really worth it. It comes with hard work, dedication, and perseverance. There’s no other recipe. 

My life today is amazing. I stumbled on this forum last week to reminisce and am so happy to be where I am. My shittiest days now are better than my best days back then. Chasing a fleeting feeling that I knew would ultimately make me sicker than a dog. You always have to pay the piper...there’s no other way. Sometimes you can cheat the physical, but it’s nearly impossible to cheat the mental...which happens to be the hardest part. 

My future is by no means set in stone. I have many obstacles in my way. And stressful times that will test me. But I am at a point where i can see things clearly now. I don’t regret the life I used to live. The strongest creatures in nature are the ones who’ve been mentally and physically tested. The ones who find a way to survive even through seemingly insurmountable odds. The life of a junkie was empty-to me. Maybe not to others, but it was to me...and I lost everything. And still, even through everything I’ve been able to accomplish in the past few years, there are numerous irreversible consequences and damaged relationships that I’ll never be able to fix. And I accept that. 

I hope this helps. I don’t expect a bunch of people to drop their rigs and run off to a sub clinic, or treatment. But I do think it helps to hear success stories from people who actually get what you’re going through, and or understand where you are in life. I know it helped me. ",1513578285.0

Your tolerance is no longer that high. Quit taking high doses this is how you OD and most deaths come from. 

Think of it like this. If when you quit a year ago you were at a 10 bag shot. Doesn’t mean a year later you can do a 10 bag shot without needing to be narcanned or worse a ride in a coroners van. It isn’t a race you don’t need to snort or shoot every bag you bought. Take it slow try 1 bag and go from there. End Rant. ",1513570305.0

Been legitimately considering shooting up all day. Pull me out of it please.,"Yesterday was 8 weeks, and I went through the entire day, so boom 8 weeks. Fuck heroin she's a total bitch. Throughout my time abstaining my feelings have been that as far as I'm concerned, heroin can go suck a fuckin cock, so long as that cock isn't mine. Yeah some days are tough but I've for the most part been repulsed by the idea. 

But today. My god, today. I've been thinking about it so much, but not just thinking about it, actually considering it. I hate it. I don't want to have my mouth water at the thought of a shot, but I'm fuckin drooling. 8 weeks is the longest I've gone in a solid few years, and I'm pretty god damn young so I can't stop now. I'm around heroin all the time, I'm offered heroin all the time, and I don't know how but I've been able to turn it down in a heartbeat up to this point. So here's the rundown. 

First off, can't be sober tonight. Fuck that don't even try for that option guys, it's not a real thing. I have to slam something because I'm a disgusting IV fiend, and as mentioned heroin has been jumping up and down trying to volunteer. However given the distance between myself and my last shot, I know heroin is just a mean fucker and I can't give any room for that bitch to get my balls again. I've been shooting and on/off selling meth like it's going to disappear from the earth any day lately, so that's an option. However my tolerance is starting to show itself so it feels like a waste of what little money I have. So then I look at my other option, heroin. Fuck that though got 8 weeks, have to look at other options. Oh, meth. Won't get high enough, what's my other option again? This is the loop I'm stuck in. 

Junkies gonna junk, tweakers gonna tweak and fiends gonna fiend. I'm all 3 of those right now and have to satisfy. I can't break out of the mindset for heroin and it's honestly really scaring me. What the fuck do I do?",1513570215.0

I gotta get this outta my system.

Anyone else ever overdose on cocaine? I'm not talking like uncomfortable and throwing up, I'm talking about not being able to inhale, just gasping and your throat is shut?

Here is my story: 

So I got out the joint the first time (not this time) and I meet this guy that is selling a bunch of cocaine and meth, and just a little bit of the hair-on. I pretty much upped his heroin game in no time flat, ended up moving in with the psychotic fucker (there is another horrible story about this fuck to follow, don't worry) I am slanging helli heroin for him, and he normally would give me a ball of coke for free about once a week. Enter the speedball. I would normally sit there and shoot it all with my girlfriend (RIP Kaila) and have a grand ole fuck fest.

One week he only had hard on him and he threw me a massive ass cookie of it, probably 5 grams. Now mind you, I don't smoke fuckin' crack, so I was kinda shitty and I just threw it in my Crown Royal bag-full-o-drugs for later funsies. A few days go by and I wanna shoot me a speed ball, fuck it, I got crack and strawberry Kool-Aid, we about to get SPUN! I do like 5 shots back to back all in the same spoon, everything is great. I mix up another shot and my guy calls me and asks for a half-g, says he is right down the street at DG already, so I oblige him and run it there and come back in like 15 minutes. Fuck yes! I have a shot ready! Pull that fucker up and FUCK ME! I knew it was gonna be bad about 3/4 of a plunger push in. I am pouring sweat already and I am dry heaving but nothing is coming out. I go to suck in air...and NOTHING! Cannot get my throat to open!

Kaila, God bless her soul, is standing there screaming at me to breath, crying her eyes out, and like beating on my chest, just complicating the fuck out of the situation. After about what seems like 5 minutes (probably only 1 minute) I can finally get a bit of air in my lungs. 

What had happened was I wasn't letting the acid in the Kool-Aid break the base down long enough on the previous 5-6 shots. When I left to make the play I left the shit sitting for 15 minutes and it broke EVERYTHING down. I'm guessing I did about a .6er of about as pure coke as you're gonna get because of the salting process.

This scared me away from cocaine for, oh....about 3 days.

Think about it, if you have ever truly indulged in your life ( quite a hilarious thing to say to an opiate forum haha) then you know inside of you that the material world and materialism are not happiness and that happiness is found within the mind and the consciousness hence the reason addicts seeking comfort sell materials and material services for the bliss, calmness and most important of all the indifferent view of the world the mind has when you use, and the lack of need of acceptance disguised maliciously as pleasure by Heroin. Doing heroin, for everyone I feel is similar, theres a knowing in the mind regardless of how good you feel in the body, that you have been tricked, and to avoid anguish and misery you agree with it just as someone captured bends to the needs and wishes of their captor.

(lurker thoughts),"**Background**: I am a lurker. I spent a few years addicted to high dose prescription amps. I was never on the streets or stole. but lied a lot. ended up burnt out and borderline insane. tons of health problems too. nowdays the only drug I do is shrooms and coffee. Weed makes me demotivated. I rarely drink. I am a straight edge software programmer at the moment. I lurk on the drug subs just out of interest. I had some clarifications

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao8L-0nSYzg

So I am sure many people on this sub have seen this video. it seems to have a really nice idea or larger message. That the core of addiction is lack of connection

And to a degree thats true. I think many people looking at addiction seem to forget that addiction and poor mental health often go hand in hand (at least in my experience). And that addiction is a very complex mix of many factors. But on the flip side, what the video gets wrong is that people in hospitals are doing opiates due to pain. I could be wrong here but are the dosages of opies used for pain much lower than for euphoria? (I am not experienced with hard opies, so could someone chime in?). Also; don't people who use opies for pain use it for shorter periods of time in a hospital? I also presume (and hope) that doctors are incredibly careful to wean you off of it, and ensure you have little background of drug abuse

**Overall, I would like people on this sub to poke holes in the video. I think its a little overly simplistic. Speaking from my speed addiction, its partly true. but not a complete picture. Noone I know closely is addicted to heroin luckily, thats why I am on this sub. I think if you gave heroin to 100 people who were mentally healthy, a significant chunk of them would end up addicted**

For me, my main focus is to decriminalize, and set up some sort of morphine maintenance program of some sort. That would be ideal to me. As with maybe meth. E and LSD maybe can be tightly regulated in a similar way. you get a card and a proper background check to buy a set amount monthly etc. I am not sure legalization (available openly with no restrictions) would end nicely for the simple reason that making something this addictive available to the public openly like that could end badly. Some sort of regulated system needs to be in place though. because fuck fentanyl. the idea that you have a chance of dying everytime you do any hard opiate scares the fuck out of me. its gotten to the point where cocaine, xanax, Ecstasy, and even weed are getting cut with fent",1513543010.0

I don’t plan to use heroin for the rest of my life (but who knows? I don’t know how long my life is going to be) . I consider myself a pot head at heart... even though I barely smoke anymore as my new habit replaced it. When I was younger I always planned on being in the healthcare field. I visited colleges for physical therapy/  physicians assistant program. I decided I needed a job that doesn’t drug test, because I don’t plan on ever not smoking weed... I feel kind of bad for dropping a childhood dream in favor of drugs, but I’m probably not smart enough to be a doctor anyway. Maybe something in business. Owning a dispensary would be awesome, but I live in an illegal state and you need a lot of money to start off. I feel so uncertain about my future. I can’t even go a day without throwing up (I have unknown stomach problems and I don’t think opiates help; I find myself sick after every meal or drink). 

Honestly, I thought I was going to kill myself before I was 18. Obviously I didnt, and despite having the occasional thought, I’m here for good. 

Now I have to be an adult and shit. I’m a senior in high school now, so I’ve been thinking about this. I have no idea what I’m going to do. 

What do you guys do? Any of you drug tested? It’s easy enough to pass a drug test on H, I finessed that when I was in IOP",1513542974.0

Please, my dumb ass is desperate for assistance.","Ok, so after watching multiple instructional videos, this is what I'm doing...

1. Flush micron wheel filter with clean water to prime it

2. Put unfiltered brown solution in a syringe with no needle (edit: through a cotton). Make sure this syringe fits into the cylindrical opening in the center of the disc all snug-seal.

3. Insert the other end of the cylindrical opening in the center of the disc, the smaller end, into a clean syringe that I intend to use on my vein.

4. Push plunger down on syringe with unfiltered solution.

Now, at this point this is what happened on my last attempt.... nothing was coming through. Then, I tenderly removed the syringe with the fluid, and saw that the brown solution had just pooled up in the cylinder. So I sucked it back up - or what I could manage to suck back up. Then, inspecting the filter, it appeared that the brown solution was all up in it, and there didn't seem to be a way to suck it back. So I chalked that up as lost solution. :(

I am convinced learning how to use these things is vital for my health, but for the life of me I can't figure it out. Can anyone help or point me to a resource that can help? I know that I am probably being a dumb ass, so you don't have to call me one, but you can if it makes you feel better. <3",1513539945.0

This is a long post but I think that some people may find it very helpful.  I'd rather not TL;DR it but , believe it or not , I left a lot out.  Gluck and please feel free to message me or reply if you have any questions or comments.  Really rooting for you guys.

I just quit suboxone two days ago , still on the ass end of knotted stomach , anxiety , lack of sleep and all that good stuff but it is all very manageable.  I have been through this ringer dozens of times , in the past it was near impossible , by now I'd be looking to cop at least a xanax (probably  heroin) or completely miserable and unable to do work.  I wanted to explain what has changed because I feel that it could at least help some people.

I wonder if you guys [have heard of rat park?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat_Park) Someone did an experiment where they found that rats in a cage would prefer cocaine over water and food .  They would choose coke even as they starved to death.  The conclusion was that coke is so addictive that rats lost interest in survival.  However a later researcher noticed how miserable their existence was anyhow so he set up a ""rat park"" where rats had plenty of activities , they could play or have sex or do the things that rats enjoy doing.  The results were very compelling (pls read link if you are unfamiliar) but the basic lesson is that it wasn't the addictive property of coke which led the rats in the first experiment to ignore things critical to their survival , it was their awful living situation.

This has a lot of paralell to modern opiate addiction.  The communities who get hit worse are those where there is no clear path to a better life.  However , the problem is more general , our society is so inhumane in that even people ""who make it"" are just as miserable as everyone else and often succumb to one addiction or the other.  Everyone is on something because we live in a society which values abstract concepts over human needs and desires.  

So , we can't escape society and I don't think suicide is a good option because there is enough about life which makes it worth living.  However , we can find ways to make our lives more expansive and satisfying , for me this starts with learning skills so that one day I may be able to travel a lot more often and have experiences which I value rather than being subject to the dreams of other people.

My point is this:  Every other time I went through withdrawal , I was a miserable fuck who had nothing going on in life and (I felt) no basis to love myself or think I was good or useful person in any way. My life was so bleak and my mood so close to depression that withdrawal destroyed whatever weak structure I had created to support the idea that my life was meaningful.  Day one of w/d I felt how deeply unsatisfying and awful my life was so there was nothing to look forward to once I got to the other side.  The physical stuff was bad but it was my lack of a sense that what I was doing was meaningful which made it 100 times worse and started the cycle of depression.  I never understood when people said it was ""just like a cold"" because under that discomfort was pretty severe mental distress , so it was like trying to sweep the floors of your house while all the doors are wide open on a windy day.

Recently, I started making some changes.  Things like taking classes and recently (over break ) studying for a network+ certification.  Of course there are other things , volunteering at hospice , getting involved in local politics , adopted two dogs who I love , doing a lot more hiking etc.  Not stealing from or being a completely unreliable shit to the people who I loved was also a plus. 

About two weeks ago a ""friend"" in college gave me a gram of black tar instead of money he owed and I was still too in love with that substance to refuse.  I got 3 8mg sublingual tabs as well since I remember how awful straight up heroin w/d can be.

The rest went as expected , took my subs at about 2 mg then 1 , a little bit of a taper down.  I know this is nothing compared to people who have been on subs/opiates for years and are now totally terrified of stopping but I've had that experience too.  I stopped the subs on Thursday this week and felt like complete garbage physically , worse than many times before because I had no tolerance and forgot what to expect.

So the physical symptoms were absolutely horrible but since my life feels much fuller than it ever did before , my head was fine.  I didn't despair , beyond feeling dumb for falling into the opiate trap again.  It meant that my suffering was now meaningful because I had goals to accomplish and people who depend on me.  I feel that my life may actually go somewhere and I may , one day , after lots of work , be able to live a life which I find meaningful and as satisfying as life can be.

I know I went a long way to make a fairly obvious point but I honestly never realized this until this time around. I just want you to know that the worst part of withdrawal is that it triggers your depression , feelings of low self-value , feeling of being a failure or lacking healthy connections with others etc.  But when you are actively working on your life (even if you are sincerely doing so while getting high all the time) then you will have a foundation for recovery.  That foundation makes the physical symptoms just that , and it truly feels like a flu or something which you know will go away soon and in the meantime, you have activities which you enjoy , people you love and a plan which you are dedicated to that will make those 3 - 5 days of the worst part go by very quickly.

So after 20 years of being terrified of withdrawals I finally understand those who consider it ""not a big deal at all"".  For them withdrawal was just one event in the context of a rather full life .  I promise all of you that if you build a meaningful life , w/d will be so small in comparison to that , that it will feel like a cold and nothing worse.

Good luck.  I love all of you , we have more in common that most other people alive today.  Please keep going , stay alive and you will be grateful for that decision soon.

I just took 3 oxy's thinking ill be fine since ive been on codeine for 3-4 years...

And wew, its a very different high, i feel like i can just sit here, play path of exile, and watch south park on the screen... but i also feel heavy headed, like, it takes effort to turn my head.

Also, my back feels fine, i hope that i don't get hooked on oxy since apparently it's far more addictive then codeine -.-

We only have a couple, however they were all working fine when we did our last shot a few hours ago. After I hand it to him he tells me to ""get the fuck away from him"" because I was getting in his way. I move to the bed and am doing my own thing and then suddenly I hear a gasp-- he had spilled the whole thing, and it had the last of our shit in it.  

He instantly starts freaking the fuck out, and yelling at me ""Why didn't you check it before you handed it to me?? This is your fault!! If I hadn't had a broken one I wouldn't have been shaking and I wouldn't have spilled it! What the fuck is wrong with you?"" I calmly start to see where it spilled so I can throw a few cottons on it to try and salvage whatever little was left.  

He continues yelling ""THERE'S NOTHING LEFT! YOU FUCKED IT ALL UP!"" and of course this turns into a like ten minute long fight where he's calling me dumb, telling me how it's all my fault, etc. I bought the goddamn shit in the first place and have been buying for the both of us 90% of the time for a while! I'm staying calm because there's not much we can do, I can't change the situation or reverse the past, and it's not like we're sick or don't have any more money or whatever. But all he wants to do is accuse me of it being my fault.  

And here's what I can't really say becasue it's past midnight and we already yelled way more than is appropriate and I'm trying to avoid that happening again: IT'S NOT MY FUCKING FAULT. YOU COULD HAVE CHECKED THE RIGS YOURSELF. YOU WERE RUSHING ME TO GIVE YOU ONE. YOU TOLD ME TO GET AWAY. YOUR HANDS WERE SHAKING. YOU SPILLED THE FUCKING DOPE. NOT ME. I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.

Ugh. Sorry, r/opiates. Just really needed to get that off my chest and figured y'all would understand the ridiculous arguments that arise when drug related (or rather, lack of drug related) issues come up. I get so sick of taking responsibility for things I didn't do. My man has an issue overall with pinning the blame on others, however he is a mostly amazing person who I love very much and is intelligent, caring, and rational.

Like a few posters on here, I'm a first time poster and long time lurker of this sub.

Quick run down of my situation, 27yrs old, been taking oxy, xans, vals, tramadol, tapentadol and lyrica. Had a cycling accident about 4 years ago that lead to a pinched nerve in my neck, chronic migraines and eventually lead to compressed nerves on both sides of my lower back (L4 and L5). Lost my job as architectural graduate because of the amount of time I was taking off because of the migraines - up to 2 weeks sometimes with a few days in hospital on more than a few occasions to help relieve the symptoms.

Anyway, I was mainly taking tramadol at the start cause it helped and it felt good. I was a bit worried about the whole lowering of the seizure threshold when you go over 400mg in 1 day (I think thats right?). So my neurologist and Doc agreed to try me on 2x 10mg Oxy/day. That was almost 3 years ago and now currently I'm alternating from 2x 20mg Oxycodone/Day and 1x 40mg Oxycontin/Day. Over this time I've received scripts for Valium and Xanax for muscles spasms.
I nearly always finish my scripts early (sometimes taking 80 to 120mg/day) and thats when i get the tramadol, valium, lyrica or xanax until i can go see my Doc again. Sometimes it's a week early, no serious withdrawals just a bit of an upset stomach is all. I'm not going to lie to you guys, I do take them recreationally some days as well as obviously for the pain I'm in.

Scariest part about my story (apologies for how long this is getting!!) was that I ended up having a seizure one afternoon after taking about 800mg of tramadol over the course of the day. Thought that would be 'the wake up call' that you would see in a movie or something, however the seizure just lead me to hurt my neck and back further, so... back to the Oxy.

Having the seizure means I can't drive for 6 months (1.5 months to go), and I just had a bit of a 'mini breakdown' today when it sort of all hit me at once, kind of felt nice afterwards to let those emotions out. I live with my partner and I feel like some sort of burden on her. I'm having financial issues while I work at a cafe (trying to get back into Architecture) while she's just graduated and started a new job with a generous salary. Being stuck at home, no driving, barely any money (very very fortunate to have parents that help me out when I'm in serious financial trouble)... I'm like a stay at home dad, but without kids!!, taking oxy and spending my time on the couch watching TV or drawing.

How do I know if all my problems are because of taking drugs? Being in pain? or am I just having a seriously bad 2017 and I just need to keep pushing until I can find a balance of work and pain relief? Weekly physio and pilates, walking a lot (cause of the no driving), and starting back at the gym, I'm really trying to get my shit sorted... But fuck most days I can struggle to walk or stand up for long periods of time because of my neck and back pain and I simply need the oxy!

Again, very sorry for the length of this post! I guess I'm just curious if any of you out there are in similar positions or have found some type of balance? Or if you've simply weaned off from the drugs and found a way to live with the pain?

Any suggestions are clearly welcome!
Cheers.

I’ve only ever posted in here once, right before I quit H for the 3rd time...lasted about 3 months, even with doing percs on the reg. I didn’t even seek it out though—my old dboy texted me telling me he had M boxes cause he knew I was all about those, and motherfucker just had to give me a sample of gunpowder with my blues.

Anyway, I became a regular customer of his again for a minute but his number is dead now. It’s been a couple weeks and I never got a text from another number like what typically used to happen. I’m pretty high rn on H and vyvanse (needed to clean my apartment lol) and I’m realizing how little I have left.

My ex whom I still kick it with all the time got a bunch of 5mg oxy so we’ve been doing that a lot recently, but idk what I’m gonna do when this gunpowder runs out. I can’t afford to just do pills. I’m considering trying kratom until I figure my shit out but I’ve also been brainstorming....would Tinder work?? I feel like being a reasonably attractive chick I could totally just make some dumb profile that mentions partying or something, fuck, idk.

I've been a prick to  a few people here. and I just want to apologize. im sorry. my life is in a spiral of shit and I come on here and project it onto you. I've noticed that I'm a dick to the people that, upon reading their post histories, remind me of myself. 

my life has been on the precipice of a kind of shit storm that I've been in before but to a degree that I've never experienced.

I'm sitting in the bathroom of French themed casino and I read kicker support that young lady in the therapist thread and it showed me that I'm on the wrong side of human interaction. there's people on here helping and supporting others and all that I do is put people down, isolate their insecurities and vulnerabilities and do my best to demolish them, I do my best to concentrate as much hurt as I can with my words and to what end? what do I gain by being this way? 

my life is in shambles. I was sober from January 16 to about 3 weeks ago. my classic pattern of sobriety, service, happiness and proud family, good job, friends, community to gambling, isolation, drinking to smoking tar and crack. 

as I sit here in the French themed casino and hotels bathroom smelling strangers shit, burnt tar, and my own body odors all I have to look forward to is facing my aunt who is gracious enough to let me stay with her for the past few months until the next few days before she moves to Colorado leaving me with 1 place to go, back to my parents house. 

I am 27 years old. I make 15 dollars an hour. I just gambled my car away the second and last time via title loans. the first time my sister bailed me out and paid them off the 1500 dollars.imanipilated the title out of my family and just gambled it away the second time hoping to hustle up some money to pay my sister back but to have some money to move out on.

I sit here in this bathroom with 10 dollars in my pocket to pay for parking. I sit here smoking my last 2 dubs of black, the only thing that let's me quell the despondence inside. the pain of not even being able to feel sad. 

I'll have to face this music. it's the same song but a new cover. the same song I've been playing since I was 18. 9 years of pure degeneracy of varying degrees. 

my father has all but given up on me. I've broken my mother's heart endlessly, now I've essentially stolen 1500 from my sister who took a chance on me one time. my other sister happy with her husband and beautiful son, my only nephew. and I the  27 year old weird junkie degenerate uncle. sitting in a casino toilet smoking foil and baring my soul to a forum that I do my best to emotionally abuse as a sad hobby when I run out of money to gamble or turn to when I'm high and have no one else to talk to.


everyone I know is from a 12 step programs I've picked up along the way since the first time I got clean at 20 or the half way house i just proudly left after 6 months thinking that I had the world by the balls. 

I'm a fucking loser. I'm an ugly, short, socially inept toxic individual. every girl that has ever let me in their life was better off upon my departure. 

i have no idea what lies ahead for my life once I leave this bathroom stall. I have 1 dub of tar left, ten dollars to pay the parking to get my 1000 dollar car that I owe 2900 out of the parking garage to get it to the room at my aunt's house that is only place to stay for the next 4 days before I'm forced to go to my parents couch to show them just how low and in debt I really am. they don't even know I've relapsed. 

I've never been this fucked. it's almost impressive how complex the fucked is this time. 

I can't do detox again, I can't pay this debt off, I can't go back to the half way until after Christmas if at all, I can't make it to work without this car, I've got 1 months to come up with enough to pay the title loan and I haven't even touched what I owe my sister

why do I torture myself like this? why can't I put my life together? why do I tear myself apart.

anyways, I'm sorry klove, I'm sorry kicker I'm sorry to any of you flawed people who manage to remain kind and helpful to one another. rest assured I've punished myself, I don't know where my life is going from here.

if you read this thank you. I feel terribly selfish expecting anyone to read my diatribe of sadness after the way I've treated this community.",1513658981.0

thanks to a couple of our venerable r/opiates moderators (/u/kickersx12, /u/travs3dpe) agreeing to help out with the mod duties for the chat, we're now located in the sidebar again. also, I wanted to explain that the room exists and is open for people to hang out in any time they like, not just when a post has been made as a reminder. feel free to use the room at any time. it doesn't belong to me or anyone else in particular, i'm just there to keep the power on and the water running, figuratively speaking. we now return to the usual announcement below.  


the chat is going to stay hosted on ezcapechat because it actually has admins you can contact with problems and bugs, it's far more stable, handles data faster, appears to lack the echo problems that tc had, has a functional youtube player that anyone (not just mods) can add tracks to and it forms an automatic playlist, and you can personalize the chat text and color, as well as move the cameras around more freely. the room is at [WherEiSopiatechat](https://www.ezcapechat.com/rooms/whereisopiatechat). If you can't click links for whatever reason the address is https://www.ezcapechat.com/rooms/whereisopiatechat. We've had a good group coming in which is still growing, with biting wit, naturally ebullient conversationalists, excellent cross-genre musical selections, and just the right admixture of nods and grime. We have a lot of fun, so come check it out. Continue below (or not) for disclaimer and rules:

**this chat is not affiliated with this subreddit or its moderators, and has its own moderators, rules, and etiquette. if you feel someone there has slighted you take it up with the moderators of tinychat, as it is completely unaffiliated with and not endorsed by this or any other subreddit.**  

rules:  
1. pick a unique username. this is to protect other users so we know who is who, given the nature of the sort of activities we enjoy.  

2. no lurking. again, to protect the other users. if you come in the room be prepared to introduce yourself and participate for at least a few minutes so we know you're not up to any shenanigans. if you are lurking you will be warned and then given a generous ten minutes to announce yourself. if the time runs out, you will be kicked (not banned) until you are ready to come in and actually participate. if you are a known member whose identity can be confirmed, this rule is not applicable.  

3. no -isms or hate speech, even accidental. one warning will be issued, any continued insistence on such behavior will result in a ban. bans can be contested by pm'ing a moderator (me). this includes but is not limited to racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia. for example, if you are not black, use of the n-word, even with the -a ending, will not be tolerated. i don't care if your friend down the block lets you say it, it's not your lane.  

4. no auditory fuckery. due to peculiarities of the transmission of sound over a chat, certain echos and effects can be amplified to the point of being severely distressing. if it is determined that your end is causing an echo you will be asked to use headphones, or to mute your microphone when not speaking. deliberately making strange or unpleasant noises to annoy other chatters will not be tolerated, and your broadcast will be closed. (this only means that your video/audio feed will be terminated--you will still be allowed to type. this appears to be less of a problem with the new chat app.)  


i know the rules seem like a lot but there's really only four of them, and only two that pertain to just behaving in a manner that isn't dickish. thanks, and hope to see you there! **don't use alone.**",1513657804.0

I've pressed and pressed and even used pain journals to show it's not helping the pain enough....which was just ignored really. If I press any harder I would lose my prescription.

My question is what do I do? Do I try a pain management clinic without a referral? (He won't give me one). Do I try a different internist? Do I just suck it up and try and live with the pain? (Not sure I could do this if I wanted, I'm miserable)

I used to think we pill-heads were ""safe"" (or at least ""safer"") from fent, but my good friend just OD'd on Saturday night thanks to some fucking fent-pressed M-boxes.  I knew something was VERY wrong when this good friend dropped some pills off to me, and I told him they didn't look right, and they also weren't the right weight (I weighed them).  He tried some anyway, figuring his high tolerance would be able to withstand a little fent... and then he stopped texting me for 16 hours. 

Turns out he OD'ed, and landed face-first onto the floor in the middle of the night... and thank goodness his Mom somehow found him and gave him Narcan. He's alive, but almost didn't make it. It is friggin' *terrifying.*

Apparently M-boxes are faked the most often, and just this weekend I noticed several posts here in this sub about fake M-boxes, and/or people asking if their M-boxes looked legit (they weren't). 

__I am BEGGING my fellow roxy/oxy enthusiasts to heed these warnings:__

*  1) __Familiarize yourself with what real M-boxes look like.__ Take note of the shape of the M, and how the two points on the top of the M should be filled in more, almost reminiscent of a Motorola M.  If it looks like the same boring Arial-font M, IT IS FAKE.  Also, the ""3"" in the ""30"" on the back should be vaguely reminiscent of a McDonalds M on its side... the beginning and end of 3 shouldn't curve around and point towards each other, but should point almost straight out.  
*Here's a helpful thread with photos for identifying fake roxies:* https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/5l1rkg/fake_pill_post_for_fashionablyfake/


*  2) __Get yourself a cheap-ass scale on Amazon and weigh your pill before taking it.__ *Yes, I know it's an extra step. Is your life not worth it?* M-boxes should weigh 130mg each.  ( *Here is a list of how much pills should weigh each:* http://www.bluelight.org/vb/archive/index.php/t-508296.html  -- and  *Here's the scale I have and it's less than $20 on Amazon:*  (American Weigh Scales GEMINI-20 Portable MilliGram Scale, 20 by 0.001 G https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0012TDNAM/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_YtgoAbW5JSNPH ) 


*  3) __CARRY NARCAN, and ask your friends and family to carry it, too.__ Many pharmacies carry it; so do needle exhanges... and if you have nowhere else to turn, there are beautiful souls on this subreddit who will mail some to you. Read the sidebar-- the info is there!  (And here: http://www.getnaloxonenow.org/GetNaloxone.aspx  )

*  4) If you use in secret and nobody knows about your usage, please do not take any pills that you are not 100% sure are real. Nobody will be able to save you, then. It is better to feel like shit than it is to feel like DEAD. 


I love you all very much. I am so grateful my friend didn't die and that his mom was able to save him.  I know many, many people aren't so lucky.  Please just be safe... __an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.__

Love, Grandma



*TL;DR: If you like pills, please follow these steps to help make sure you stay safe. There are a ton of fakes out there and we pill-heads are no longer ""safe"" from fent. My friend OD'ed and we almost lost him.*

I'm fucking miserable.,"Hello friends. I don't know if this even belongs here, but I don't know where else to go with this.

I first started using when I lost my mom, fucked with hydros and oxys for about a year before my ex helped me quit. Her words were ""I want you to be around for awhile so we can be together."" Just the thought that someone could care about me that much helped me quit, almost cold turkey.

I've recently moved to a new town where I know no one, and the only thing keeping me off of opiates is gone. My three-year long relationship has ended, and I genuinely don't know anyone that really, genuinely cares about my wellbeing anymore, including me. It's not that I'm suicidal (anymore), its just that I really don't care if I was to die any time soon.

This past weekend, I had a stressful business trip and I came home to my boss yelling at me over some presentation I had dropped the ball on and pictures of my ex in the arms of another man on her Instagram.

Long story short, I popped about 6 percs over the course of seven hours and drank quite a bit of liquor until I passed out.

I woke up about four hours ago, feeling like shit, and now all I want is to find more pills to go back.

Honestly, the warm, fuzzy hug of opiates right now is the best substitution I have for any human contact or concern about me. The opiate high, at least to me, feels like someone I love holding me close and telling me everything's going to be okay.

Been posting random updates here and there on my journey on quitting roxi 30s.. Started december 1st with an oxy habit of about 90-120mg a day. Made my first attempt at quitting on the 2nd going CT.. Made it 3 days and relapsed. Picking right back up at 90-120mg a day from the 5th to the 10th. Made it a pathetic 2 days clean from the 10th-12th. After that it's only gotten worse. Went from 90-120mg a day to anywhere from 180-210mg a day from the 12th until today... Now i'm attempting to jump off CT from a 180-210mg a day. Feel helpless. Scared I'll give in in these next upcoming days. Would subs be a viable option for me? or will i inevitably  end up furthering my addiction even more and get hooked on them and have to face more serious withdrawals down the line?Soeey if this doesn't make much sense. currently on 2mg xanax and i suck at benzos. I can usually feel good on as little as .5mg-1mg of sub and i'm scared if I go to a doctor that they will force me into taking more like an entire 8mg strip. Anyone with experience in this topic please help a brotha out.

Edit: I'm been using oxys daily for 6 months. It's just this past month my use has sky rocketed and can no longer afford it and the withdrawals are unbearable",1513626145.0

But I've had these Morphine 15's for almost 2 months now and I just haven't dove into them, so I'm curious, would 1 be a decent high?

I have 2, but would 1 be worth taking or should I just pop both?  Again, I don't want to throw up, and if 2 would make people with zero tolerance do that then I'm not down.

He started out supplying us with girl for about a year. Never thought I’d be able to get off of it. Eventually we switch to boy which our dude has as well. We had a really tight relationship with him. Great prices, we’d give him rides, hang out, whatever. 

Recently, things went downhill with dude. He couldn’t afford his rent payments and he’d call us asking us to spend or just asking for money. Which we’d never be able to help even if we wanted to. One night, we were chillin with friends who wanted a G of girl. So we call dude and ask for the G plus a $20 is boy. We get there, he walks up and has a friend with him. He never has anyone with him. Plus, he didn’t want to get in the car which was weird. But whatever, my fiancé hands him money and he gets a tiny bag and dude walks away. We look and it’s just the $20 of boy, so where’s our girl? He acted like he’d be right back so we wait. He eventually walks back over and asks why we haven’t pulled away yet. We tell him we’re still waiting on him to hand us our G of girl. He FLIPS out. Starts swearing he gave it to us, swearing on his kids etc, saying we’re lying and just trying to get more off him. It was obvious he was playing us. So we go through the motions. . Searching the car and the area though we all know what’s going on. We end up going home with no girl and no money. Our friends were pretty cool about it.

Couple months go by, we haven’t fucked with dude in a minute cause of that BS. He still needs money. Says he has some great boy, and his sons birthday is the next day. Well, I don’t get paid until the next day. We’re sick AF, so tell him if he looks out for us on a half we’ll pay him back double the next day. We pick up, and it’s awesome shit. We enjoy ourselves and I don’t answer any texts or calls for the next two weeks. 😂😂 To be fair, he probably only paid $20 for that half I’m not about to be out another $100 to him after all that shit that went down.

Any fist hand experience?,"Ive been trying to quit for a while but whenever switching from dope to suboxone I'm still sick for around 3 days before the subs completely take over my receptors,  reason being because my tolerance is currently at 2.5g/day and the subs seem to have a ceiling effect on how much they will help you even after waiting 24+ hours. Ive heard of the Burnese method, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4959756/, which pretty much states that you take micro doses of bupe than taking your normal dose of h and doing this over the course of a few days while upping your sub dose and getting your heroin dose to 0. I know the obvious reasoning is to just get my tolerance down or just buckle down and handle being sick but it hasn't worked for me after many tries so please don't suggest that, I'm just curious about this method, thats all.

I told myself all of those things. I'm healthy for now. And yes it's true the body is VERY resilient and strong and it can take a hell of a beating and most of the time it can heal without too many repercussions. But what if it can't?

Im a completely addicted daily user. I use about .2-.6 or 20-60$ of South Floridas finest heroin through IV of course. i recently came into some Methadone pills marked U42 which are a tiny round pill scored with a line on the back to separate it. Im going to go ahead and make the jump to taper down with these and get clean off dope since ive been making a somewhat half assed effort these past 2-3 weeks to try and stop using which just hasnt worked at all. Now that ive came into these pills, and about 105 of them i want to go ahead and use them wisely for the opportunity to taper down over the next month or sooner to go ahead and get off dope and have as little pain of withdraw as possible. Given the ROA and amount i use daily what do you think the correct type of amount would be to come down gradually to have as little pain and withdraw symptoms as possible? Id appreciate any feed back what so ever. As well as any information that anyone on here has or knows about the specific pill that ive ended up getting my hands on. I will check google for information about these pills as well but personal experiences are always appreciated. Thanks a lot guys it means a lot to me. I have shitty impulse control and just want to go ahead and get this taken care of before i just say fuck it and stop copping dope for a week and just eat these pills everyday to get faded af and then screw myself into having nothing to make landing back on baseline any easier when it comes to quitting and withdraw time.

I'm hoping for some insite to an issue I'm having. Since I was 15 I've been eating domes, hydro, oxys off and on amd never had a real issue, until I was in a car accident about 2 years ago now. I was in pain management with 15 mg morphine er, and 10mg percocet.  And I would finish my script in about 2 weeks, every week. 

Fortunately For me, an old army vet buddy of mine,  gets morphine 60s, and oxy 30s. And I had a pretty reliable connect for the OP 80's (which I think are shit, but I'd kill for one right now) anyway so on and so forth I was chewing up anywhere from 120, to 240 mgs of morphine on any given day, and/or 180 to 300 mgs of oxy a day. Sure it kinda ruined my life a little bit, but I blamed it on the pain and the car accident. ( i spent $20k, my entire settlement on pills and hotels in about 2 months) . I felt like if I went 6 or so hours without something I would start feeling withdrawals.  

Okay so ran out of money, wanted to die, been a shit parent, and finally I'm like let's get clean. (Alot of it was no longer being able to afford drugs, and realizing I had been such a shit parent.) So in the last 2 months I've only taken kratom, except for maybe like 15 morphine 60s over a few days one week. I don't have withdrawl, I'm okay, as long as I take kratom. But yesterday it hit me. I tried everyone I knew to spend some of my rent money on some oxy,  but to no avail. I did find subs tho. I'm gonna get one this afternoon. So I'm hoping to hear what you guys think. Is it worth it? Is it gonna make me crave oxy? 

I want so bad to get high again. Thoughts, suggestions? 

Edit- So just for reference I've been taking pills off and on for 13 years, and was strung tf out for just over a year, ending about 2 months ago 

Edit- I didn't get kicked out of pain management,  when I got my settlement, I lost the insurance I was using, and just started buying all of my drugs. I want to get back in, but this time I'll have to go through Medicaid  

Edit- So I didn't win today, opiates did. I coped a 8mg sub and just blew 1/4. I haven't got anything from it yet, maybe I'll do another 1/4",1513613564.0
