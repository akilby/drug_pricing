I did a rapid detox over a month from 12 mg to .5 and stopped on January 3rd of this year. I made it about two weeks and the insomnia and lethargy just were killing me so I got some kratom and that shit made me a new man(no shit, right?). Well I was a little worried about replacing one for another but I though wtf kratom can’t be worse physically than what I just went through. Now 2 months later I’m down to a really low dose I think, about 2.5 g 4X a day and the physical WD’s are cake compared to subs no doubt..like not even comparable BUUUUUUTTTTT the only thing that’s killing me is the lack of any motherfucking energy when I skip doses. I’m weaning down but I’m thinking there’s no way to beat the low energy. Like I said the other physical WD’s are extremely minor but I just need some recommendations for supplements or something and yes I know exercise is great but c’mon y’all know how motherfucking hard it is to even take my kids to school or do ANYTHING when it’s like this and anyway I work a full day at a somewhat physical job(maintenance at a high school) so I’m moving but only because of the kratom. Sorry about the long post but I’m at my wits end here, it’s becoming really fucking depressing.

Are they ever going to stop writing books about Keto?

Even though I am excited about trying new pharmaceuticals, to be added to my list; I am kinda worried about the synergy of brotizolam and opioids. I am prescribed 30mg ms-contin (morphine sulfate extended release) for pains daily, and added clonazepam(0,5-1mg if needed) or bromazepam (3-6mg if needed) (prescribed too) for extra sedation (to go sleep, or to relieve stress.)

Should i be worried about combining the brotizolam with my daily prescribed morphine? I am not the type to overdo things, so if I get my hands on the brotizolam tablets, i'm not gonna do more than 1 per night. I would also choose to use 15mg of morphine instead of 30mg. From what I've read is that brotizolam 0,25mg is close to a 1mg rohypnol tablet etc.

I never do experience bad breathing or respiratory depression, so should I be worried? I'm getting a tripsitter during the tryout of brotizolam.

I thought I'd previously read that Clonidine and Neuroton (sp?) are 2, but I'm not sure what symptoms they help with.  Is there anything else crucial to enduring the process?  Not really looking forward to night sweats or stomach issues.  

&#x200B;

I've been thinking about quitting for a while now, but a recent development has kind of forced my hand.  I'm in pain management for legit back issues and have been prescribed oxycodone in various doses for about 15 years.  The highest dose was around 205mg per day.  I was on that for 10 years, but with all the new FDA rules and such, I have been drastically cut to around 75mg per day for the last year or so; which sucks but I've adjusted as best as I can.  I just considered myself lucky to still have a doctor willing to prescribe opiates for pain. 

&#x200B;

 All that changed a couple of days after my last appointment when the DEA raided her office.  According to her, they're investigating whether she's assisting patients with 'diverting' pain pills to the streets, which is ludicrous.  This woman is the strictest, most by the book doctor I've ever been to.  She performs random drug tests, and not just urinalysis. She's also conducted blood draws, hair follicle, and saliva tests in case patients are some how circumventing the piss tests and she's immediately discharged those that have street drugs in their system or those with none of the prescribed meds.  She also calls people in for pill counts, which I've never had to do with any doc before, and she's cut down patients (like me) with what the FDA now considers high doses.

&#x200B;

Bottom line is, she knows her shit and she complies with all federal regulations and guidelines.  According to her, she was not arrested and the DEA did not suspend/revoke her license to prescribe, but they did ask her to not to write any more until their investigation concludes.  That was nearly a month ago.  It seems to me like they've already investigated her and couldn't find anything on her, so this is the tactic they use to either intimidate legit doctors or force them to close, since technically, they can keep an investigation open for years.  

&#x200B;

As such, its probably better if I just quit and suffer rather than trying to find another doctor since they're almost extinct anyway.  I don't want to trade one dependency for another, so Suboxone is out and I can't really afford to be away from work and family to go to rehab, so I'll just try to quit cold turkey.  I know there are medical concerns with this method and it's easier said than done, but I'm going to try it.  So I appreciate any suggestions on any meds to help ease the issues I'll go through when I withdrawal.  Thanks in advance.

ax19sd,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/ax19sd/question_about_visiting_a_specialist_that/,9,https://redd.it/ax19sd,swanzy1,Question about visiting a specialist that prescribes Suboxone,"So I’m ready to just be off this wild ride already. My relationship with dope is love hate just like anybody else’s. When I actually have money and have dope I’m on top of the world. My mood is great and I’m an overall very enjoyable person. 

More often than not though, I’m short on cash, bills pile up, making small amounts of dope stretch because I’m terrified of withdrawals. 

I don’t own a laptop of any kind and have never set up the dark net, so I’m always making 1 hour round trips to the city to pay 100+ dollars for “dimes” and can never get my plug to actually hook me up with solid weight despite how much money I always spend. 

I’m terrified of withdrawals because I like to think I live a somewhat normal life that an entire week of being out of commission would ruin it all and give everything away completely. 

I went through it once about a month and a half ago and had to take like 6 days off from work, actually had to visit my family doctor (which costed more money) and provide doctors notes and the whole nine yards. My girl and my fam just chalked it up as me being super fucking sick with the flu until I scored more powder and leveled myself out .

So my plan is to score just like, a weeks worth of subs to get myself through the ugly part of the withdrawals and I know I’ll be in so much better shape than the other times I tried quitting. I can never find anybody selling subs on the street though, and I’m just curious how these visits go with the “suboxone doctors” 

I saw a post about a week or two ago of a user who was pretty confident in the method of going into withdrawals on day one, and then visiting the methadone clinic for only like 3 days or something and then letting the long half-life of the methadone ride you out for the last 3-4 days of W/D’s - if you’re that user, please tell me more.

But anywhoo, I wanna try the suboxone route first. I’ve used subs recreationally before and I just know they’d get me off of being sick just enough for me to function throughout the week or two it would take to set me free. I understand after that it’s all willpower and I’m confident in the fact that I hate what dope has done to me to the point that I’ll be able to stay away once the physical pull is gone. 

So when you visit these doctors, do they like, have to prescribe me suboxone as an addiction remedy? I have a cousin that receives 90 8mg strips a month and he made it sound like he literally went in there and admitted his addiction to opiate pain pills, complained of a bad back and boom, he was instantly receiving scripts of this shit. 

The couple of places I’ve called to attempt to set up an appointment though made it very clear that the initial doctors visit is paid for up front out of pocket, no insurance involved. 

I’m not sure if my insurance covers the actual suboxone, my luck is it does NOT, but I’ve heard from this same cousin of mine that you can purchase subs from the pharmacy (with a script of course) by the single digits for like, 10 bucks a pop or something. 

I just don’t have the extra money to waste on a doctors visit that’s not going to get me anything out of it. This wild ride with this wicked drug has taken so much out of me the past 3 months and literally feel like I’m at my breaking point. 

Any advice at all would be amazing. I’m down to my last (5) dimes that I have to make stretch the next couple of days until I can sell some shit of mine to scrape up another $60-$100 and hopefully score some 4mg subs from a lady my tweaker middle man set me up with....

... what I life I’ve found myself in. 


TL;DR - I’m sick of relying on dope to function, curious about what a doctors visit for some good ol suboxone entails. 


Thanks for listening y’all. Felt pretty good to just type all of this bullshit out. Sorry if it’s just adding another pity post to the sub. I know a lot of ppl on here are quite understanding and supportive though.

I am fully aware of the dangers of mixing the two, so I appreciate in advance and warning against mixing them — but I’ve mixed oxy with booze, cocaine, weed, etc. before. And this is not a method I will use long-term, but I would like to try it while I have both drugs in my possession.

Fast forward a bit and I'm on the needle again. I have this one spot that I can hit with extreme ease and speed so I eventually blew it. So I got some generic Neosporin put some on the spot one night and slept with a bandage when I woke up the next day there was a rash almost in the shape of the band-aid. It's been about a week and the rash is still there. Does anyone know what that could be? Or has anyone ever experienced a rash around their injection sites? It's itchy and looks something similar to psoriasis. Again excuse me for my poor writing skills and thank you if you took the time to read this. ,1551641470.0

When I first started using opiates I would use solely for the nod, as I believed it was the most euphoric part of the experience. 

It’s been a long time since I’ve used but I’ve been wondering, do people (including those not addicted yet) ever use just for the mood lift/high without nodding? From what I remember if I kept my eyes open and didn’t let myself nod I wouldn’t feel nearly as  euphoric as I would while nodding.

I enjoy writing, and I'm trying to write a piece wherein somebody overdoses on iv heroin. A part of this will be from that person's perspective, I think?

That's why I'm asking. When you overdose, for a while before losing consciousness, would you be at least somewhat aware of what's going on around you, despite being unable to respond? Or once you've reached near total unresponsivity, have you also lost your ability to take in anything from your senses?

I know these may be odd questions to ask, but I would really appreciate some input. Cheers.",1551613859.0

So my buddy calls me about 9:30A.M this yesterday morning and told me, man I dont have a ride to the dope man or I would just go my myself, but man if you go pick me up 4 packs, I'll give ya $100 bill. I said shiiiii say no more lol I gotcha. 

So I'm on my way to get it and he says gotta be here before 11:45A.M before my mom gets here. I said I can do. I was there by 11:15A.M. we exchange and I tell him, i gotta go to work for 2 or 3 hours. I gotta clear coat 1 kitchen counter top and a bathroom sink counter and go to the unit below that one and flake those counters and ill be done then ima come back over and kick it and get high. 

I get to the apartment complex im working at for the day around 1:45P.M. I get a call no later than 2:15P.M, my sister, she says, brother, what the fuck did you give him. I said wat the fuck are you talking about. She said you know exactly what i mean. Hmm no I don't I said. She said, brother, he OD, he is not breathing and isnt showing any signs of life. Said he locked his self in a room and done it. And to add to it. His girl was with him. Shes in the other room in the same condition. I begin to scream and freak out. Balling me eyes out. Im so scared at this point. About 20 mins goes by and I get another text saying, they pronounced him dead. And his girl friend is unstable. I just know im about to catch 2 account of man slaughter. 

About 5 more mins pass and I get another text, he just woke up outta no where, they are checking him out to make sure everything is okay. Basically it's a fucking miracle tbh. He shouldn't be here. When i say so much weight was lifted off of me. I was literally already starting to go crazy about thinking i killed my friend. I mean im not the drug, i didnt sell them to him I was just the car ride he didnt have. But I still felt as if it was my fault.

So his parents are beyond pissed off at me. They never wanna see me again. They told the cops I was the heroin dealer supposedly. Getting threats like how his dad is gonna try and kill me for what i done. Im just so lost.
 Right now. Evem though he made it along with his girl friend I still feel like a total piece of shit. I'm just not sure why im even here anymore. I just wanna go. 

But all this has opened my eyes big time. Even though i dont wanna live. Im still going to the methadone clinic bright and early Monday morning when the doors open at 5:00A.M. I cant keep doing this to my self. I need a change before i really end up doing some shit i cant take back. But yeah scared straight for sure!!!

P.S.     Tell the ones you love that you love them, even your friends and even if they know it and you aint gotta say it. Still say it.

awr853,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/awr853/sooooo_heroin/,13,https://redd.it/awr853,FendA1,sooooo.... heroin.,"Hey everyone, im not too sure what im doing here but i thought this might be a good place to just tell my story. I'm not exactly sure why I'm doing this, but fuck it im going to do it anyway. I attempted to post to r/drugs but got a ton of hate so maybe this community might be a bit more understanding about my situation. I'm not too sure what I'm trying to get out of this, Advice? Guidance? Maybe just someone to acknowledge my existence but here goes.

So, the first time I tried heroin was when I was still a teenager (19 to be exact and 22 atm), prior to this opiates weren't exactly new to me. I had a ton of experience with oxy after my grandfather passed away and me being the sick depressed anxious person I am decided that I would steal his entire stash. Was it morally wrong? Maybe. Not really mine to say, I just remember me and my family cleaning out his house and 17 yo me finding a shoe box under his bed filled to the brim with oxy. I'm not too sure what prompted me too take them, was kind of like I was looking at myself from above, something inside me just decided to take them. I looked around the room, looked at the box, looked around the room again and shoved the box in my backpack and didn't really give it a second thought.

As you can probably guess I indulged heavily and my massive supply allowed me to maintain a steady habit. Before trying oxy i had some experience with lean but found it to be quite overrated, but good enough when combined with some good weed and Valium or Xanax, anyways im getting off topic. I remember the first night i attempted to snort 4 5mg oxys, it was futile as the amount of powder to get up my nose was enormous so the whole experience was stunted to say the least. I felt slightly giddy, sleepy and went to bed thinking that oxy was a massive letdown. The next night however i decided to just eat them instead, within half an hour i was in bliss, floating on a silk cloud, i realized how fucked up i was when i noticed that i had been simply staring at my blank laptop for over an hour, just basking in the beautiful opiate-induced sun. Needless to say, i began to take them heavily and regularly. I look back on those days with nostalgia.

I began to take them before school and soon realized that if i didn't over indulge i could quite effectively spend the entire day in the clouds and no one knew. i kept up a constant habit for 3 straight months and no one noticed, not one fucking person. I guess looking back on it now it was perfect for my personality, i was extremely introverted, shy and socially anxious so no one really could tell i was on something. i didn't have a heap of friends anyway so i'd just go to all my classes with my headphones in high as fuck, although most of my time I didn't even attend class. Preferring to isolate myself in the music storeroom playing guitar or going to the park to smoke cigarettes and read. I don't what it is but something about being surrounded by old cello's, violins, piano's and sheet music comforted me more than any other place. After school I'd typically go home and smoke weed, take more oxy and then when wait until my girlfriend at the time finished work. I'd go to hers, drop a couple more oxy, we'd fuck or just talk and then she would fall asleep while i spent the night staring at the ceiling while she slept next to me until she woke up the next morning while i had not slept and we went to school, rinse, repeat for about 3 months.

All good things must come to an end however and i had to eventually kick the habit after my supply ran out. I simply told my mother i had food poisoning and spent 2 weeks shitting and puking. However, unfortunately this was not my last contact with opiates. Fast forward to me being 19, I was still a heavy drug user but more of a poly substance abuser rather than one particular chemical. I simply took any or all opiates, benzo's, barbs and weed that i could find. For some reason, i had no interest at all in amphetamines.

Anyhow, one night, and i remember this incredibly vividly, it was dark, stormy and windy. Me and my drug buddy were spending the night getting fucked up and playing video games, waiting for our plug to arrive with some klonopin and lean. He knocked on the door and my heart rate skyrocketed as my body primed to induce kpins and sip some lean with some nice indica. He came in, we had some cones together and he gave us the shit. He was just about to walk out the door when he spun around and said 'Hey, I'm not sure if you guys are interested but i got some new shit. Managed to score some pure china white heroin.'. The mention of the H word at the time sent me for a spin and i looked at my friend. It was that look were you don't need to say anything however we both knew exactly what was about to happen.

After he left I stared at the small white rocks he had given us and both decided that i would be the one to first do it. I took a single rock out of the bag and placed it on the foil. Chasing the dragon wasn't completely foreign to me as i had done it a few times with oxy. As soon as the flame hit the foil a thick line of smoke began to rise and I attempted to inhale as much of it as i could. It tasted slightly sour, almost like vinegar. As I inhaled as much smoke as i could i held it in for as long as i could, a feeling swept over me. It felt like someone has poured a warm bucket of water over my head and as the water began to trickle down my neck all my worries, anxieties and problems simply dissipated with it. This wasn't like benzo's, barbs, alcohol or cannabis where my problems were simply numbed. With heroin, they just dissipated as easily as the smoke did when i exhaled. I let out a long sigh as i exhaled and fell back into the couch, the experience felt almost spiritual, something entirely different from anything i had done prior.

However, my plug went off to rehab for a benzo addiction the following week, so my dance with the devil was only for a night. Until recently. Through a variety of circumstances I met up with a friend I had not seen for a long time, this particular person, while incredibly down to earth and friendly had chosen a dark path in life and had started to hang out with some particular people that aren't exactly sanitary. He had started to smoke a lot of meth and began to rob people and shops and went to jail for it. One insanely bizarre experience happened when it was very late at night and i was walking home from a party or something. All of a sudden 3 people jump out of a car with t-shirt's wrapped around their faces demand my phone and wallet, when one of the boys unwrapped the shirt around his face and its my fucking friend, he turned from his drug-induced haze into the friendliest guy, asked what i had been up to, how I was doing and gave me a hug. He then apologized for the misunderstanding and they drove off, my valuables still in my pockets as i stood still thinking what the fuck just happened.

I distanced myself from him as while I wasn't exactly straight either, the shit he was doing and the person he was becoming was not something i enjoyed being around and methamphetamine was something that i neither enjoyed and also had seen a lot of my old friends fall victim too. While talking and reminiscing about the wack shit we used to get up too being young teenagers he asked if he could tell that he was on heroin, like the night i first did it the mention of the word sent my heart rate skyrocketing, i hadn't danced with the devil for 2 years but i cant say it wasn't on my mind, although buried deep in it. I asked him for his plug, knowing it was a bad decision to make but doing it anyway just like when i stole my grandfathers oxys all those years ago. He gave it to me no problems, we said our goodbyes and parted ways.

For 2 weeks i stared at the number in my phone, debating whether i should call or not. Compared to the vast majority of my friends I was doing okay in life. I had a steady job as a bartender, attended university despairingly and tried my best to indulge in music and reading while still maintaining my massive hedonistic substance abuse. Despite this my mental and physical health was horrible. I had a horrific sleep schedule, would rarely eat and then get stoned and take Xanax and eat massive amounts of fast food that would make me horribly sick. I was depressed, spending days in bed, incredibly anxious and i had practically isolated myself from everyone after high school. I had not had a intimate relationship for almost 4 years and I was lonely as fuck, finding solitude and release in pornography.

One day, after a particularly terrible day i decided fuck it, ill call. To my surprise a quiet girl answered, she asked my name and how i got this number. I mentioned my friends name, i asked for what i wanted and she texted me the address and asked that i text her when i was 5 minutes or so away. Also surprisingly was that the address she had given was only about a 10 minute drive from my home. Fuck.

I arrive and in 30 seconds a rather cute girl jumps into my passenger seat. For a moment she seems surprised, i guess i didn't look like her normal clientele, I drive a car on the nicer end of things for my age and (not to be narcissistic) I've been told that I am quite good looking and I like to keep myself relatively well kept. She looks at me and then looks at her feet, I notice the self harm marks on her arms and the tracks marks that are scattered along her armpits and legs like craters on the moon. She's about my age and despite her physically concerning attributes i found myself kinda attracted to her, i don't know if that sounds fucked up but its nice to know that other people are struggling like me ya know? She drops a small bag in the cup holder of my car, I give her the money and she mumbles something and gets out. To be honest, it was the easiest drug transaction I had ever done. No waiting around for bud and benzo dealers. The interaction was over in 30 seconds.

I drive the 10 minutes home, my heart practically in my throat, i feel sick with excitement and anticipation. I recede to the comfort of my room and look at the package. 100$ Australian Dollars for 3 small white rocks in a small plastic bag, 2 points of pure(ish) china white heroin. Again I reconsider my life leading up to this point, reconsider my decision purchasing this harmful drug but as soon as i do the inner demon comes out and like a puppet I crush the powder of 1 rock and snort and the bucket of blissful, clean, pure, holy water was once again poured over my head and down my shoulders.

That was 2 months ago, I have managed to purchase it only once a week but even this habit is expensive. I don't know where to go, i dont fit in with the junkies and i dont fit in with normal people either. Do I abandon my habit or let it consume me. I often think, maybe if i tried, that things could get better. A nice wife and some kids sounds good. Maybe i can teach them piano scales like my grandfather had done for me when i was young, the same grandfather who i stole all his pain medication from his cancer treatment after he had died. but hey, heroin sounds nice aswell ya know. The comforting spiritual bliss is a 5 minute drive away, shes always around and it has not once been a fuckaround to get.

 It's always in my mind and sometimes i swear i smell it randomly, to distance myself from this insanity i'm working 7 days a week 10 hours a day just so i have no energy to go anywhere except to go home, injest a fuckton of valium and xanax until i pass out and drag myself out of bed to do it all again. Although theres a part of me thats just thinking you're only working heaps so you can rationalize buying more H. It's amazing how quick this drug has got a hold of me. It's almost like a girlfriend, shes sweet and beautiful and makes me happy. But she doesnt love me back and when i wake up in the morning shes not they're next to me. But im still there, just a little poorer, a little weaker and wishing she'd come back with just an empty plastic bag to remind me of her.

Sorry this is so long and if you have read this far i thank you, whoever you are. I didn't intend for it to be this long but once i started typing i couldn't really stop. I kinda guess that everyone is going to tell me to stop using, I know that. I'm not sure why im writing this, just to get it out i guess even if no one reads it at all.

Anyways thankyou again, i hope you are all well, and if you're not I hope you are soon. :)",1551593008.0

One night I stole seven Ativan out of the bottle in Larry’s coat pocket while he slept in a pile of trash in the corner. It had been a hard night for me, because I was sick and mostly unable to sleep from a lack of heroin. He sat up and patted his chest to feel for the bottles when he woke up at around 10 and pulled the bottles out. Eleven pills had turned into four while he slept. He looked at me angry and desperate. I said, 

“I’m sorry!”

I made empty promises to repay him, but when he demanded proof, I ripped the microwave out of the wall and stuffed it into the red roll-around suitcase. It still had a laminated card from my grandmother’s travel agency and my own information from my flight to New Mexico. 

“Call Luna! Tell him to bring a dub!” A dub is a twenty-dollar bag. 

“What? You think he is going to want that nasty little thing? You’ve lost it.”

“Just call him! I’ll deal with him when he gets here!”

Larry called our dealer, and I could tell Luna was trying to confirm that we had money over the phone, but Larry danced around it until Luna agreed to come anyway. I slid my arms into the sleeves of my NASCAR racing jacket and headed across the parking lot with Larry hobbling on crutches. It was a no. 24 Jeff Gordon racing jacket, bright red with blue flames up the sleeves and a bright blue DUPONT logo on the front. My mom had ordered it for me brand-new, to replace the old dirty one she made me throw away in California. Larry’s crutches creaked in the cold across the asphalt. The suitcase rolled behind me and half of the microwave stuck out. The power cord dragged behind.

My life had finally all unraveled. ",1551590852.0

Just wanted to share a little bit and open up a dialogue about chipping.

I wanted so badly to be able to get high on opioids and particularly heroin as a recreational substance like I did with cannabis. Oxycodone was awesome but expensive. I compare it to a completely lucid drunkish high which also gave me the feeling like I was loved and accepted. 

Getting the first needle high was the point of no return, though. I absolutely disagree with some people saying it's only about the rush for shooting up. It's free from any nausea and it felt like an even cleaner high to me. Feel free to convince me otherwise though. 

Anyway I had always promised myself that if I did 3 days on and 1 day or more off I would not get withdrawal, and if I ever broke the rule then I had to quit. This went well for about 6 months, but eventually I did a 4th day. I quit, and only relapsed a few times as a one-time thing over the next few months. I kicked for real with the support of friends and other loved ones though.

The only way I could keep it together was to smoke weed every night and focus on school. Then I graduated and had to quit that for employment drug tests. The cravings came back hard...

The best way I've found to manage without popping for a drug test is to use kratom. It barely curbs the cravings, but it works enough that besides checking this sub as a lurker daily, I don't feel tempted to cold cop in the city or anything. Luckily I seem to be completely immune to any withdrawal symptoms from kratom, perhaps it's because I only use a few grams at a time and never once experienced opiate/opioid withdrawal. Must be the partial antagonist acting like an uldn-opioid combination? I'd love to discuss this further with anyone.

The point of this post though is to show young chippers that it's not worth it. You end up thinking about dope everyday even if you quit. If you're dead set on chipping, my suggestion is to wait until you're older. if you ignore this advice it's very possible you'll end up focused on dope instead of life, and you'll be addicted and without any skills or education and no money to fall back on. Safe your money, invest it wisely, and go to the dnm once you have several million in the bank or something. Make sure you can afford a gram a day for the rest of your days as an old ass William Burroughs motherfucker, it is not a good idea to roll the dice with opiate/opioid addiction early in life.

Everyone and everything has been dry for weeks, aside from a friend of mine who got a little morphine from his grandpa. I’ve been living off of that to keep the withdrawals away. I’d say it’s probably been a week and a half since I’ve actually gotten high, and it’s killing me.

I brought enough perks (or so I thought) to last me the trip. Well by the time I was 3/4 of the way there I had 2 left and I knew I was going to be sick if I didn’t get something. So what do I do? Cold cop!!

So I head into the heart of the biggest city on the way when I’m almost to The deep south and I figure find some homeless dude, they will know where to score! So I take my opportunity when a homeless man asks me for chips. I say “I’ll buy you chips if you can tell me where the boys at” he eyed me up and told me. I went in and got him chips. 

On my way out I decided I just wanted his help. I rolled down my window and said I’ll pay him if he will just come with me. He agreed and hops in my car. We go to where his people normally are. Nobody there. So we go to his backup. It’s this drunk black dude standing outside a gas station. I immediately don’t like this anymore but god damnit did I need something to hold me over til I got home. 

The dude jumps in my back seat and we go to where I thought his boy was. Turns out I was picking his girlfriend up. Whatever. We get her and finally go to the dope house. He goes in and cops me 2 10 sacks and we are outtie. I drop his girl off and I go to drop him off. He starts asking me for money. I have him 5 bucks and said bye. He got this blank stare in his eye and I started to reach for my concealed carry. He snaps back and says some dumb shit and hops out. I drop off the 1st homeless person and I finally make my way out of town

I get to a good spot and go to bust it up. It looked kinda grey. I wasn’t sure and I didn’t care but I go to smell it and what is it?! FUCKING COCAINE! I was sososo mad! What a waste of time and I ended up not being able to cop and was so sick the entire 22 hour ride home. Got home and smoked a 30 and snorted one and now I’m over it.

Guns, guns, and more guns including a spear gun and loaded flare gun under the sibling's bed. The smell was of course LOVELY.

Day 3-4: 6g in the morning, 6g in the afternoon
Day 5-6: 5g in the morning, 5g in the afternoon

Day 11-12: 2g in the morning, 2g in the afternoon 
Day 13-14: 1g in the morning, 1g in the afternoon

I also have 35 1mg klonopins to help with sleep and anxiety mix Lion’s Mane, tyrosine and Bromantane to help with recovery, and magnesium and melatonin to help with sleep, I also have a Juul weed pod to use as a last resort that will be available for me.

My habit this time hasn’t lasted nearly as long so I’m hoping to come off with less discomfort than last time. I’m also signed up for a gym and have been going and lifting as well as doing cardio 3 days a week and intend to keep it up throughout my recovery.

This past November marked 4 years opiate free and I had an interesting method to obtain this goal that I figured I would share.

I was a functioning heroin addict working 5 days a week doing $100 bags a day. Always sniffing, never got to the needle. Anyways I had tried 100s of times to quit before but nothing ever worked and the withdrawals were too much and I would always cave. I believed that if I could somehow get past the withdrawal symptoms then I would be golden- so here is how I was able to do that. 

*It is important to note that I very badly wanted to get clean and if this method did not work I was going to seek serious help and quit my job*

This is a three week “detox” that allows you to live a normal life, sleep, work, etc. This may not work for everyone but it did for me so I hope it can for you too. The three things you will need to complete this detox are adderall, neurontin(gabapentin, “johnnies”), and klonopin.

The first week I would take a combination of adderal(15mg) and neurontin(900mg) when I woke up to get me through the day. Early afternoon I would take a klonopin(.5-1mg) to take the edge off. This combination of drugs is extremely euphoric(would compare it to a small roll of ecstasy) and completely took my mind off of the opiates leaving my body. I would then take another klonopin in the evening so I could sleep, rinse repeat.

The second week the opiates are completely out of my system and the worst part of the withdrawals are already over with. This week I eliminated the johnnies as to not become dependent on them, and moved my kpin usage to once a day. So adderall in the morning and kpins at night to sleep.

The third week I eliminated the kpins, but continued with the adderal in lower doses. The toughest part of this is being able to sleep, so I substituted the kpins for an OTC sleep aid (NyQuil Zzzs for instance). 

If you can successfully get through these 3 weeks you will have *hopefully* avoided dependence on the three crutches and completely avoided withdrawal symptoms altogether. Anyway it worked for me so I believe if done correctly it can work for you too.

Good luck fellow users. I have been to the depths of addiction and back and believe it has made me incredibly stronger in the long run. I hope you can all find inner peace (when you are ready of course 😉)",1551550294.0

Finally got around to trying Kratom and honestly, it hit me Much harder and stronger than hydros/codine/coke. I'm guessing my body sucks at processing those specific pills or maybe they were bunk? Kratom is by no means ""intense"" either but i would call it more ""euphoric"" than the others. I would ask r/kratom but you know how they are over there.

People always talk about triggers and I never understood. A lot of responses to dope porn on here will be people saying they are triggered. I never felt anything when I would look at pics on here. Then, one day I was listening to an old episode of Dopey. Chris (R.I.P.) was talking about shooting coke and telling some crazy story about it. When he describing everything; fishscale, blood flowing into his worx, and the waiting for the blast off. As soon as he was talking about that 5 seconds between when you shoot and when you feel it, I was in WD and all I could think about was getting a bag of coke and some dope to wash it down with. I was like in full withdrawal. Now I understand triggers, before that I thought people just needed to relax and stop being such bitches. I didn't know that you can actually physically feel a trigger.

I never did get anything that day, but I fucking wanted to more than ever in a year and a half.

Now I'm freaking out.,"Hey my fellow bropiates, I've got a question for y'all. So, I just cooked up a shot of BTH same as I do multiple times a day. This time, however, I actually hit a vein immediately. That doesn't really happen anymore, so you can imagine both my surprise and excitement. So I took my shot. However, something that hadn't occurred to me before is that the time it takes me to hit a vein, is also the time my shot has to cool down. Tonight, when I hit so quickly, I took advantage of that shit. So I pushed the whole shot in. When unwrapped the belt from around my arm, immediately my thumb and the heel of my hand started BURNING like I had dunked it into boiling water. My hand IMMEDIATELY swelled up a lot. Like, so much that my thumb literally felt like the skin was going to split down the side, the skin was so tight. My skin also appeared to be burned, woth raised white and red splotches from the spot on my forearm where I hit the vein all the way down to my fingertips. The splotches have gone away, but my hand is still discolored and whiter than it should be, as well as being still swollen, though I have gotten more used it. Also, my hand went numb for about 20/30 minutes, as well. I started writing this post then, but then my asshole brother started yelling at me about how much of a piece of shit I am, and I had to put this aside for a moment. 

So, as of now, my hand is still really swollen. My thumb feels fucking huge and the pressure in it when I bend it to do fucking anything at all is awful. The spot where I initially hit and did my shot is still stinging as well. I guess my question is: has anyone had this experience before? Have I done irreversible damage? Will my thumb ever go back to normal? Is that vein still usable at all? I'm getting back on my suboxone in like 2 days, so it would really be poetic justice that the last bag of dope I bought to finish off this relapse and get back on my subs would be the bag that fucks me up for good. Lowkey freaked out, although not nearly as bad as when it first happened. ",1551530171.0

Why am I feeling this way right now? My parents picked me up off the streets from a different state about two weeks ago. I was homeless and just panhandling for crack and ice. (ironically moved to this state to get clean from H, but found out the whole place is a fucking DOPE HOLE and lost every single possession I had. From my car to my apartment with ALL of my clothes in it). 


I would get ten bucks together, get a shot or a hit, and rinse and repeat. Was the same routine every fucking day. But it's not the drugs I'm missing. I can get those here. 




I miss the street life. I really don't know what it is. I loved seeing and recognizing fellow homeless people/addicts on the street, as well as being recognized by them, feeling belonged, and welcomed in a way? The conversation would always be the same every single time. Usually it'd start out with ""how much you got??"" and if we had enough we'd go half on a dime. 




I miss the drug dealers. I miss walking into the trap house or motel room to be served and feeling welcomed and belonged. I miss hitting my stem in his tents in his back yard, even though immediately after I'd  ALWAYS feel like I was being set up, by the fellow crack heads, or the dealer himself, to be arrested. 


Not one person knew my name out there. Yet I've never felt more belonged. I've never felt more like I've fit in somewhere except the streets. I also know that not a single one of those people gave a FUCK about me. They only cared if I had something they could use me for. Be it money, drugs or a connect. My head made me feel like they were 'friends', knowing full well they were the furthest thing from that. 


What is wrong with my head right now? I have no body else to vent about this to. I am posting here because I feel at least one person here has to feel the same way. I know it is not a rational feeling *at all*. 

Why would I want to go back to sleeping at Waffle Houses? Or behind abandoned buildings? Why would I want to go back to having paranoid episodes, literally so in fear of the law, that I'd throw all of my belongings, like my backpack, or my phone away to avoid possible incriminating evidence, even though I knew there was nothing in there to begin with?? 


Why would I want to go back to going WEEKS without a shower? 

Why would I want to go back to BEGGING for money? 

What the fuck is wrong with me? I'm home right now in my warm bed with my lovely dog, safe, with free food in the fridge, yet I feel home sick. Please. Somebody tell me they have felt the same. 

I miss the streets.

As I noted before I had thousands to spend at her house and she turned me away for ""higher clientele""

Well, that stupid bitch just had a stroke and can't remember a damn thing! She can't even walk now! Her whole little empire has turned to shit. One of her underlings who used to sell hers for 8 a pop ten years ago back when the standard was 5 is needing us! And we are having a blast with this. She, the underling who was the Dgirl's ""business partner"" wouldn't even let us slide on 50 cent and now is begging us for the hook up!

Don't get me wrong if it were anyone else I would have compassion but, the Dgirl and her underling are getting their just deserts. When I got the news I laughed my ass off. This is why you shouldn't deny people's money simply because you think you have the power over them. Just because you have the hook up and plug or whatever the term for dealing is now, don't mean you should lord their addiction over them and try to rip people off.

If you abuse your power as a plug and mistreat the people who you knew the longest and have dealt with you the most just to make a quick buck then I really hope this happens to you.

I turn my hand over to see the faded but still prominent H burned into my hand.


“This one?” I say pointing to it, while I remember every “last” cigarette that led to my personal brand.


“Not that one, the H is for our family. These lines here” pointing to a large, dark, carving on my forearm.


I am glad that Ty can't yet read the “I AM DEATH” that the lines spell out. But nevertheless I know he will press for an answer. 


I struggle in a fit of “ummm and well you see” until my wife takes notice. 


Dark curled hair frames her face, as her mahogany eyes read my silent plea for help.


Calmly she says “Ty some things don't need an explanation”, picking him up to play with our other two boys. I mouth ‘thank you’ to her as she subtly smiles.


It is only the second talk during church and I'm already seeing patterns in the stucco. Staring at the words suddenly and intensely took me straight to the moment I made them. 



In a blink, I'm 21, living at my parents, driving my shitty 2001 Altima, and losing my mind again…



I was losing a battle with an unknown neurological disorder, or that's what the doctors thought. For a while I was prescribed various antidepressants and antipsychotics. But I was blessed with the occasional script of oxy and a monthly supply of Klonopin, but those had run out a week ago.


The grips of withdrawal had consumed me, the stabbing pain, vomiting, and constant the nausea and flu, of opiate withdrawal showed my mask dying. I had never been in benzodiazepine withdrawal before but, the mix of oxy, klonopin, and a few drinks was blissful. Alone or not I didn't care, the months supply was gone within 10 days, and then madness set in. I saw walls melt, carpets turn to water, cars change color, and voices came to whisper indistinguishable noises in my ear. After two weeks of this my sanity hung by a thread.


My “best” friend at the time asked me to be his best man that night, and normally I would have been excited, but in withdrawal it put a wrench in my plan to end it all. Isopropyl alcohol induced liver failure was my plan, but now I had an obligation.


Instead I decided on a new plan and began meticulously carving into my epidermis. The words “I AM DEATH” bled into my Meeseeks robe, followed by a baking soda chemical burn. 


Words now there forever as a reminder of the inevitable price to be paid. 


With my gaze fixed, my wife senses I'm lost again. She places her hand on my scars, she knows of the demons within. Knowing the secret habits, tastes, and slip ups, that I kept hidden. Slowly she brings my eyes up to hers and I emerged from the icy depths of my past, gasping for breath. 


After a few dirty looks I knew where I was. I tried my best to forget the words, with my wife's hand as my only anchor to this world...

Need advice.,"Picked up some blues from my guy, he told me they were pressed. I’m somewhat naive to this whole deal so I figured that meant the person just pressed the pills themselves but with the proper mixture etc. 

Hit one today. It was hell. 20 minutes after snorting, I find myself just staring at the tv, ears ringing, tunnel vision, etc. I never really felt afraid for my life as I was breathing fine and still alert to an extent. Everything subsided after about another 20 minutes but I’m still feeling kind of rough. 

Anyway, this whole experience has made me wonder if any of this is worth it? I’ve been able to chip successfully for several year without any major concerns. However, the last few pickups have not had the right high that I’ve been looking for. It seems impossible to get anything pure. It isn’t because of tolerance because I never take any more than 30mg once a week. It just seems like everything is fake shit and I don’t wanna dance with the devil at all.

When you first start going to that spot, it's one of many. over time, you favor it more and more over the others. During this time, it gains your trust and you can rely on it. You like it. it becomes your go-to site. Eventually you start to go there exclusively. it's everything you want and need.

 Its gets you through tough times. its been there through good times. it was there when your family member died,  when you got sick, when you celebrated that one holiday, when you graduated, when it was sunny, when it was rainy. it was just there for you. You loved it.

you keeping smashing it till one time it doesn't respond out of no where. Meh, it happens. So you go somewhere else for now. It was just a fluke you think, that's all. You go back to it and try again and it's ok again. But then after that, it's not. Then its ok again. Jeez you think, this motherfucker is bipolar. You keep trying and nothing seems to help it be 100% loyal.

You look for another spot that takes care of your needs. You experiment with others And then remember this one spot that you thought was promising before you went exclusive.  its still there, waiting for you to make a move. its young, fresh and you just click with it. you start going back and forth. the new spot is different, and the old spot was always there for you. You are torn.

you want to make it work. You keep trying. you are hoping it'll just do what it had been doing like before. But it just won't connect with you anymore, no matter what you do. All you do is hurt it. Nothing good happens when you go to it.

You know you should leave it alone. Everytime you go to it, you just cause damage and unrealistic expectations. You know you should stop trying. You know its toxic for you. the best thing to do for both of you is to just not go there anymore. you should let it heal and move on. you are sad but have no choice but to avoid it.

a period of time passes, and you decide to visit it. You check it out. its changed and is different. its hardened. it got a new color to it. It's skinnier. you think and hope itll be like old times. you think you can just go back to it and pretend like the bad times never happened. So you try. You do everything like before, desperately hoping you both will connect again. 

but its harder to connect with than even before. It changed and worked on itself but you didn't. That's it you think to yourself. You have to accept it. times changed. you miss the good old days. You can't do anything but think about the times you had when it was all good.",1551466887.0

You start off completely sober.  Get bored one day and mix in a little h and you feel like a million bucks. Only a little dab will do ya. Life is great.  Within a week, you’re not even able to get high anymore, you’re just doing more heroin, simply just to feel normal. 

What’s the longest binge you’ve ever been on, and enjoyed it?  As in, how long were you on a dope binge before you chose to get clean for a little while, either because you had to or because you wanted to drop your tolerance down?

I’ve been off and on using for 10 years. As I get older, the withdrawals tend to get worse. The depression and anxiety are nearly unbearable. 

I’m on a week right now and I’m already tired of it so I’m going to try and clean up over the weekend.  I’m scared because I am already very depressed. That’s why I am on the dope again in the first place - I have been hating my life for so long now I just wanted to feel good about something. But now I’m going to be facing additional depression and anxiety while trying to kick it. I was definitely suicidal as it was, going into this situation. However, I don’t have what it takes to follow through with it. I’ll never do it myself. To top it all off... My fiancee of 4 years is leaving  me, she found out I was using and won’t put up with it. 

I desperately want to talk to someone in the healthcare field but I don’t want to go to the ER or be held for observation. I’m not going to do it myself. I cannot reiterate that enough.  Anyways, I posted quite a few questions, I hope they draw enough attention, and that people answer them. I’m very scared and alone right now. I just want to die. ",1551466005.0

Idk how but it's every 15 minutes on the dot. I think it's a computer program. He also sells random ""hotshot"" bags, an idea he got from a TV show that convinced him that ppl will think his dopes fire if ppl die from it regularly. He also killed my entire family and set fire to our house with me taped to a couch. Also he leaves what he calls ""Bobby's boobytraps"" everywhere that are just used needles full of aids blood and poison rigged to inject when someone sits on one. Also he robbed me the last 27 times I went through him. 

If he doesnt answer theres always belial. Belial is a little creepy and has a wolf head instead of a human head and lives in this cave full of red light that's super annoying to get to. His dope is fire but he always makes me bring him children and the first time I went to him I had to give him my soul. Also he makes me cut a little piece off of myself and throw it into his fire as a ""offering"". Doesnt have to be that big ya know, just a digit of a finger or earlobe. He likes me so he'll just settle for a tooth sometimes which is nice. Also I have to let him possess me sometimes and I always wake up naked covered in blood with no clue where I've been.

In Georgia, the go to anti drug squad was called the Red Dogs. They were a group of special forces wannabees that were roided up with huge muscles and carried assault weapons.

They would come in with a van and usually 3 undercover cars. They would just grab people randomly, beat them and bust them. Not even close to being legal. They absolutely did not give a shit.

They worked with a supposedly undercover narcotics detective that everyone called Chinaman. He was called that because he was Chinese, maybe. No one really knew. But he sounded Chinese if you were unfortunate enough to hear his voice.

If he was talking to you,  you had a problem. Unless you thought fast, you were going to jail.

Of course, he couldn’t really be undercover because of the fact that he was Chinese and we didn’t have any Chinese junkies where I am from. Just a shitload of redneck white kids, a few black guys and me and T. And a few other characters that wandered around doing crazy shit.

But he could have been Japanese, because he sure did enough ninja stuff. He loved to hide in the bushes and see where the dope guys hid their stashes. People sold in the streets, so obviously the dope needed to be close.

T was a 100 pound redhead, and she rocked that Scottish temper. She liked to run around with her .44 magnum, which she had a permit for because her dad was the mayor of a local town.

There was a local café, which was the only place for a few miles that was a retail establishment, if you don’t count liquor stores. People used to hang out there and eat, shoot the breeze, sell dope, etc.

A guy named Greg and his family owned the café. He hated the police because they interfered with his business. One day, we were discussing this problem with him. He proposed a novel solution, which we thought would be kind of fun.

So what happened was that we sat in front of the café in my white Acura, waiting for Chinaman to pull up. We knew it wouldn’t take long because someone would definitely snitch about the 2 white kids. The cops were not going to allow us to sit there, whether we were breaking the law or not.

Sure enough, it wasn’t 10 minutes before we saw a couple of ford sedans coming up behind us. Nobody in the hood drove a ford sedan, needless to say, because they would have looked like cops.

Now, there was a notorious ripoff artist and snitch that hung out at the cafe. People called him Cat. I don't know why. Just a stupid street name, I guess.

The general opinion was that no one would miss him when he inevitably went to prison. People were sick of his shit. The dealers hated him, the customers hated him, even the little kids on the block knew he was bad news.

Between Greg, myself and T, we thought we could probably kill two birds with one stone. The ideal situation would be to do everybody a favor and get rid of Cat, make Chinaman look like an idiot and get away ourselves, so we could do our dope in peace.

We just sat there, waiting for the cars to pull up.  A minute later, here they are.

Everybody starts to get out of their cars.

T takes a paper bag she had prepared and threw it toward Cat. He caught it. I drop a doritos bag out of my window, just for added effect.

In this particular place, any sort of handoff, any bag of any type on the street, was presumed to contain dope. Anybody in the vicinity was guilty. They were going to be roughed up, cuffed and arrested.

It was actually a true fact that just being in the area was considered to be a crime. It was called DC Six if I remember correctly. The cops would arrest you just for being alive. That's how they roll in the deep south.

Sure enough, the cops went straight for Cat, who was totally innocent but had it coming.

We pulled off laughing, leaving Chinaman in our dust and lived to fight another day.

This is, by the way, an entirely true story and actually happened.",1551458654.0

Or is it just me?,"I’m gonna start off by saying that I have extensive experience with most common opioids. I’ve been a user for 4 years and in my 4 years of opiated bliss, I can’t wrap my head around why oxy is everyones go to when compared to other opis it feels like a stimulant. Opioids are my favorite class of drugs, but oxycodone just doesn’t feel right compared to morphine based opioids. 

When I take oxycodone I take anywhere from 50-75% of my dose intranasal and the remainder orally. Nothing abnormal other than smoking the occasional mbox 30 on some foil. I find myself having opi rage more often when I dose oxy and bupe than any other opioids . What I also find strange about oxy is the warm fuzzy feeling isn’t as noticeable anymore[possibly due to tolerance being high it takes at least 45mg of oxy to get me itchy… not high just itchy] I always get a similar feeling to the one when you overdo it with cocaine. It’s still enjoyable compared to other drugs but it seems to lack the most enjoyable parts of getting high on opiates. Since the 3rd or 4th time with oxy I’m unable to catch a nod. I just get hyper and a decent mood lift until something grinds my gears and opi rage takes over. I just don’t understand why it does me like that even in higher doses around 80-120 mg it still doesn’t work it’s magic like other common opioids a good example is hydrocodone other than the slower onset of taking a dose hydro orally (around 45-100mg depending on how I space my doses)it seems to get me higher than oxy. I’m just confused on how this is possible.

I can take them or leave them, I have fun with them and I love the buzz and the chill and I've only ever had an afterglow and no comedown.

However, I got hold of many packs of dihydrocodeine and I've spent nearly 2 weeks on a daily dose of around 300-450mg, taken in 2 or 3 doses during the day. 
I run out of the packs, didn't think it would be an issue like I say I run out all the time no issue. Overall I've been using for about a year maybe a couple of times a week on a lower dose of codeine. 

Anyway day later I have the WORST depression and anxiety. I can't stop crying, I'm convinced my boyfriend is gonna up and leave me (he isn't) and I have pretty frequent diarrhea. I can't sleep either. I do take sertraline, I've been on it for years and I haven't been this depressed since I had a coke comedown 2 years ago.

Side question about stimulation..,"Looked around on the interwebs for how tolerance works for suboxone Bc a few different people experience different things with it so I’m curious as to the “consensus”

Obviously typical opiate tolerance will play apart but aside from that one of my friends with (for now) a near non-existent opiate tolerance will snort for example 1/8 of a sub the first day, the next day when he’s coming down he’d do a 1/4 and feel it the same but stopping for a week or so “resets” it. He also says that once you “get to a certain level” you don’t get much higher at all and I feel that’s my experience as well

Others say tolerance doesn’t go up much unless you’re doing it for an extended period and raising your doses 

Any thoughts or comments or general knowledge on the topic? I wanna get the most out of subs in the future lol

Love, pained killers love ❤️ 

Also (others online experience this as well but I’ve yet to meet someone irl that relates) suboxone is the most “stimulating” of the opioids or whatevs to me, all opiates  are stimulating in their own way for me more so Han others (my first time doing heroin I didn’t quite do enough, was still pretty dang high tho in comparison to other opiates, and I was kinda edgy at certain points even drank some wine to take the edge off lol)

So does anyone else get stimulating effects from opiates and specifically suboxone? Lol I literally stayed up around 36 hours last time I did em Bc of the minor stim effects, also does anyone know why it’s more stimulating? I know it works differently in the brain but dunno specifics

It was Day 6 off fent a dope (or whatever is going around like hot cakes in my area) 

I went to the hospital last thursday to stay just long enough to induce subs. I was there like 36 hours total... anyways, i did my lost shot of dope in my car right before they called me back in the ER, had one prepped so when they called me back i slipped out to my car to grab ""my things"" and did a big ole shot and walked back to check in to ER. 

They gave me a pee test to see what all was in my system, and all i failed for was cannabis. I had taken pharmaceutical Xanax (from my friends script, as well as roxicodone and norcos late sunday, and thursday evening was when i admitted myself).

I wasnt shocked that those pharmaceuticals didnt show up because i do clear out rather quickly, but the shot of powder i was doing all week did not provide a positive for opiates. This is pretty scary because i know a lot of people who buy from this guy/girl daily, and have seen 2 people go blue doing this dope. There are even times he/she wont sell to any one because the ""testers"" said it was too strong and fell out testing, and he has to cut it more.

Well i did 16mg of bupe on day 1
Day 2 i jumped all the way down to 1, 1mg - 2mg dose. I took xanax the following day and made it 48 hours before taking another 1, 1mg dose. I did the same thing for the next 48 hours.

Now, my dumbass was dumb enough to to leave a good chunk of a bag at home before the hospital, and its been sitting here next to my supply of M30s. So i woke up today extremely depressed and decided to do a shot after 6 days off and going 48 hours on a very low dose of sub. 

I got the rush that all junkies desire, pupils pinned, and the small withdrawal symptoms (runny nose, achy legs, low back pain, depression) all disappeared. Catching even slight nod 30 minutes later. Did a pretty small shot. 
Less than (.03)

I know im an idiot for todays experiment, feel free to tell me how dumb i am for using. But what could the plug possibly be sending out to every one that isnt showing up on a UA?? 

How can i find out what this stuff actually is? A lot of people are using it. Been with this plug for 4months, never had problems with product or anything like that. Aside from track marks, i look really healthy. A lot people like this stuff because it feels really clean, but what do we know?? Just trying to figure out what is being passed around on the streets, the people i know have no plan of coming off and have all told me they got the same ""good"" shit since i last copped a week ago.

Any insight appreciated. Again i know it was dumb using again, wont hurt my feelings if you tell me so.

On a fentanyl high atm by smoking fent-mix on foil. I am thinking aka just also my fantasy/my imagination is going now :

............................................................................................................................

What if there was a compound/analoge of something or etc that was invented that when you take it it fixes your receptors and dopamine in your brain. Something an opi addicted person takes before going to sleep and then have ton put earbuds in and let an audio file play while you sleep. The audiofile is just sound or a voice or pfff, just let your imagination work on this very moment when you read this.

&#x200B;

Then when you wake up everything in your brain and body is fixed and it's again to the state from before you ever took the first opiate in your life OR even better any sort of drugs including cigs,coffee,etc.. No wd's and you feel great + thanks to that audiofile you DONT EVEN KNOW HOW AN OPIATE FEELS SO YOU CANT MISS IT OR CRAVE IT.

&#x200B;

Audiofile would be like a sort of hypno type thing shit. But the 1 thing you will know and remember is that you once were an opi or any sort of form addict. THAT you will remeber and know it's bad but you can't remember the feel of the high or the taste or the smell so you don't miss it. So when you have an operation or accident and have to take a painkiller so only as a last RESORT...and you are healed and dont need the painkiller(s) again after days or weeks you just repeat the procces with taking it so you are again fixed (opi receptors in the brain).

&#x200B;

I am just a little bored and high so just a little rant and my imagination i have atm. This i want to share lol. I know i haven't thought this thru and there will be many negatives. Just something i was and am now thinking about.

I don’t use but I’ve been lurking here for years cause reasons (you guys are cool, supportive, and have a great community). 

I don’t know the guy well but I know he uses (I’ve heard him mention percocets before but it’s likely he uses others). He was acting worse than normal this morning. We’re couriers for a startup and I went out for my first batch of tasks for the morning. When I came back an hour and a half later he was passed out like in the picture. 

He’s breathing and I’m keeping an eye on him but he’s in the lounge so anyone who passes by can see him. The office is still pretty empty but I’d like to help him out before he gets fired or something. 

Any idea on how I can help him out so I can grab him a super strong coffee and actually get him working before he gets in a shitty situation? 

I basically tried punching him to wake up and he won’t budge. His breaths are starting to get shorter. 

Advice?  

UPDATE: thanks for the suggestions. Ended up rubbing him super hard on his sternum and he woke up. Sadly it wasn’t in time for our boss to not see him. Now they’re having a talk. ",1551370390.0

Mind, I got a skin condition called neurodermatitis which causes itchy skin patches. Basically I was wondering if taking opioids in this situation would bring a relief to it, make it even worse as I heard of them causing an itching sensation or if it would just not interfere at all.

So I did some reading on the Opioid Induced Itch also called [Pruritus](https://www.opiates.com/opioid-induced-itch-pruritus/). The itching “under the skin” is said to mimic similar environmental allergic reactions as opiate drugs release histamine triggering the body's inflammatory response. This didn't give me an answer to my initial question, but got me thinking about the correlation to preexisting allergies. 

As allergies are also caused by histamine release, it seems intuitive that opioids make an allergy worse by releasing even more histamine in the body. But, upon a [bluelight thread](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/archive/index.php/t-639968.html) I found, they can do the opposite and reduce allergy symptoms, e.g. clear up runny noses. I believe this is rather due to masking the symptoms and other effects, but one user also said they had horrible allergies that only got better after they stopped the drugs.

It basically got me wondering about some scenarios and the effect of opiate or opioid consumption in these cases.

1. How would or could opioids influence preexisting itchy skin patches?
2. How would or could opioids influence a preexisting allergy? Also not limited to like hay fever but also food allergies etc.
3. Would the allergy get better or worse after being on opioids for a long time and then stopping them?

I'm interested in your experiences and thoughts on these issues! Allergies are so common, I bet some of you guys have experience here. I'm curious.

*Disclaimer: I still can't really figure where to say opiates and where opioids, so please don't get mad if I mixed them up. What I read, opiates refers to natural (opium-) substances and opioids to semi-/synthetic ones, but I'm interested in the reaction to both.*

*Also: I kinda try to stay away from opiates/opioids (for reasons), so no, I couldn't figure the answer buy just self-experimenting.*",1551366876.0

So, one day that summer shortly after we all moved out of the home we were living in we all sat and chilled in my dear friends yard fiending and scheming. We couldn’t steal and return stuff to majority of the stores around us anymore so the perfect idea was Craigslist/backpage.

We would meet in the parking lot of my old crib, talk for a minute outside to get to know each other, I’d give him my key, and let him go infront of me to unlock the door. Idk how this fool fell for it, there was literally a padlock on the door, but let’s just say he was real eager for some puss puss. So, we are about to “go inside” & I tell him I need the money upfront, he gets real sketched out at this point and we agree on half now, half afterwards... he hands me $100. We begin walking towards the door and as soon as he pulls the old key out I run as fast as I can to the car a parked two houses over, jump in, and we all ditch.

These phones will look sort of normal, but will fold out into android tablets. Current info places the screen sizes between 7 and 8 inches. When folded, the screens will be like 5 -6"".

Samsung and Huawei have phones coming out right now, but Motorola, and several unnamed chinese companies will also have folding phones soon.

Initial pricing looks like around 2000 per phone. I know damn well you guys are not going to use your hard earned or stolen dope money for these guys, but eventually the price will drop.

Your regular new android phones for 2019 will be bigger, faster, smarter and have more memory. They will also cost more but, don't worry, you can get ripped off by the major phone companies for as little as 25.00 per month.

As an aside, a few years ago it was almost impossible to find a cell phone that cost more than 500.00. 

Now 1000 is not that uncommon. Are they just that much better?

No. They are not.

I've gotten myself a great doctor, been seeing them for about a year now after 4 years of buying my subs myself from local connects.

**Current situation:** 

&#x200B;

I'm prescribed 2 8mg strips a day. I generally dont take anything til i'm getting up and moving for the day , or as i'm about to walk into work, etc.

When i first get my script filled I will find myself taking 3-4 throughout my day. They actually do make me feel better and more motivated getting through the busy night shift . 

I usually run out about half way through my monthly and have to buy what i need til i get to my next appointment which is just frustrating, and I know each time that i did it to myself.      ~~i'm a piece of shit~~

I really need to find a regimen and stick to it., I've thought of only taking one with me to work, i recently cut a day from my shift that links up with the one day off a week i get to give my self a 2 day break and let some of the sub run out of my system a bit. 

I also tried to set up my appointments to the ""every two weeks""  and that got me pushed to monthly appointments which screwed me even further. 

I'm worried that if I speak to my Dr. or my therapist that they will kick me out for abusing my prescription and that would really screw me right now. 

anyway thanks for reading and if you have any advice i'd really love the input ! 

**<3**

**TL;DR I basically abuse my suboxone script and i'm looking for ways to help control my usage before I get caught up with no meds or less than i should have. thanks:)**

It's been several years since I've used any opiates.

I just listened to a song that seemed to describe my relationship with opiates really well. And despite the fact that several loved ones of mine have died because of heroin, my first reaction was to want to use heroin.

I remember, years ago, hearing people say that chipping long term just isn't possible. And they're right - there's a reason I stopped, and it's because I started trying to rationalize using on Wednesdays plus weekends to use more but still avoid physical dependence. I recognized that that was addict thinking.

But when I think of heroin the thing I think about is the first time, that feeling of a warm security blanket and heroin telling me I'm safe. It makes me sad that I'll never feel that again, that feeling of perfection never comes back once it's gone.",1551328124.0

Have you ever noticed how people drive with their windows closed, even when it is 70 degrees? That is so weird.

I had an interesting experience today. I had to go to a dentist.

He fixes my tooth and tells me to take some advil, which I am fine with. Then he gives me a script for vicodin.

I tell him thanks, but I do not take opiates.

And he says, well, they are pain pills. If you are in pain, you may need them.

I say, thanks again, but it would be a waste.

That is that, but as I am driving away, I start thinking.

If you are in pain, you need pain meds.

And I am remembering the countless times I self medicated with iv heroin. I guess I was in pain. So I start wondering exactly what my pain was. Trying to pin it down exactly. Not a generalized, I didn’t feel right kind of deal.

In my case, I think it involved feeling different. From the time I was a little kid, if I didn’t know you, I saw you as a potential threat. Even if I did know you, I kept an eye on you.

To me, people were unpredictable. I would say the wrong thing and suddenly I was not cool. Oops.

As I got older, I learned how to better handle people, but I never really understood how to be social. I was still a bit hyper alert, and watched people closely to make sure I didn’t say or do anything that freaked them out.

This was exhausting. 

I suppose this must have been painful, because the minute I was exposed to heroin, I was all over it. It felt great and it insulated me from my own inability to connect.

I was cool.

Years later, I somehow figured out that heroin was like a magic trick. It sort of looked like real life, but you could tell something shifty was going on.

Heroin was a permanent barrier between me and the people that I wanted to love. I simply could not feel them while I was high.

I was out of tune. Like a human guitar. I was on a different frequency. The wrong harmonic.

This was ok when I was a kid, but eventually it got kind of bleak.

At some point, I wanted to hang out with regular humans. The internet was just not enough. My junkie friends were not enough. Life just kept rolling by.

Whatever happiness was, I definitely did not have it.

Just as bad, I was literally chained up to the dope and I could do nothing without making the required arrangements.

This all really sucked, once I thought about it. It became intolerable.

But looking at it now, I understand the truth of what this dentist said to me. Pain meds for pain. It doesn’t get any more simple than that.",1551321975.0

I call 15 min before the office closes and they tell me everyone is gone.  Tomorrow is fine. Its day 30. So it wouldnt be early nor am i trying to cheat to get it early. I will be out of meds tomorrow. 

I told him i wont be able to come in on the 1st. I wont be able to get out of bed. 

I left a nice long message from there website explainijg there mistake and hopefully hear from them tomorrow morning.

Before you ask. The script is for 120. 15mg oxy hcl.

I dont abuse them. Just the anxiousness of being out and getting sick has made my stomach in nots.

Since this is clearly an administrative mistake they should take care of it right? I told them if i had the meds id still come in on the 1st for there documentation of me being there.


Edit: So i just spoke to the same man I spoke to yesterday, and he was very apologetic and kind of even started crying. He told me he saw my record and i never missed an appointment, never late, always nice. So there wouldnt be a problem.  He says the doc should have no issue filling it as long as I promise ill be there tomorrow for documentation the doc saw me since its a c2 medication. ( been going there over a year)

It’s almost like I’m some stranger come upon a tribe of savages in the urban wilderness or even their own high priest cursed with disease or something like that. You know? So, I walk to my door. They make way, parting like that fabled body of water and wait for me to invite them in.

“Three at a time.” I say pointing. “You. You. And you first. After that, three at a time.”

My business is no secret. Not that I can say it ever was, but now, anyone with half a lick of sense can see that whoever is renting out room 127 sells dope. Sells something anyway. It makes me uneasy. There’s so much to be paranoid about.

“What you need?” I ask the first guy. 

He opens his mouth. His breath is hot and stinks. “Got 210 bucks here, boss. What you got?”

“I’ll give you a ball.” 

That's probably a little high. But, my prices fluctuate with the way I'm feeling about whoever is buying. Besides, he doesn't seem to care. Probably because he knows that the reputation the dope has will get him his money back fast. And then some. I weigh it out. Put it in a bag. He flashes a grim toothed grin and rubs his hands on his jeans. He wears a hood. He looks like a cartoon witch and steps back out into the parking lot. It goes on like that for an hour. Non-stop sales. A gram. Another eighth. Whatever 17 bucks will get. Of course, Eddy and Peanut Boy and the rest of the regulars show up. And once noon comes around, I put my bag on my back and walk back towards the bus stop.

At least I kicked the daily speedball habit for a couple of months now. Doesn't really feel like a victory tho... With all the financial trouble and shame asking mom for money when I used support financially instead of leeching off of her. Nuff rambling, hope yall are nodding safely, warm and fed. <3

Basically we have glial cells that sort of insulate the cells of our nervous system. It seems they also have receptors, kind of like the opiate receptors we have all heard of, except they are for the immune system. They help recognize foreign stuff in your body and get antibodies and such to attack.

It turns out that these inflammation receptors play a part in opiate dependence.

I had never heard of this before. All I knew was about the mu opioid receptors and how dopamine plays a part in drug craving and possibly paws.

Apparently that is not the whole story and more will be revealed. Here is the relevant info from r/drugnerds, contributed by

[https://www.reddit.com/user/selfless\_self](https://www.reddit.com/user/selfless_self)

The studies suggest *in addition to*  the role played by μ-opioid receptor, TLR4 mediated inflammation is  also implicated in dependence and withdrawal, borne out by animal  studies. Ibudilast might not be a good drug to mitigate withdrawal since  it's broad spectrum but TLR4 specific drugs may also not work well  since other receptors like TLR2 might be involved. See the excerpts from  three studies below.

>Drugs  such as ibudilast and propentofylline have both neuronal and glial  effects, and it is clear that they have multiple effects. This suggests  that (+)-naloxone analogs should be considered that specifically target  TLR4 rather than having broad effects as do propentofylline and  ibudilast. (10.1016/j.tips.2009.08.002)  
>  
>Interestingly,  morphine reward and dependence/withdrawal may differ regarding TLR4  involvement. Despite broad-spectrum glial attenuators reducing  proinflammation-linked opioid dependence/withdrawal (Hutchinson et al.,  2008a; Hutchinson et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2011), **TLR4 −/− mice are not protected against opioid withdrawal, suggestive of a TLR4-independent mechanism** (Liu et al., 2011). (10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0684-12.2012)  
>  
>Based  on findings from a previous study that blocking TLR4 receptor by  (+)-naloxone attenuated precipitated withdrawal in rats (Hutchinson et  al., 2010), we would expect that knockout TLR4 and MyD88 would protect  mice from withdrawal. However, this was not the case, as both TLR4 KO  and MyD88 KO mice displayed similar degrees of withdrawal behavior as  their wild-type equivalent Balb/c mice. This suggests that: **firstly,  there is no question that the μ-opioid receptor plays a critical role  in opioid dependence; secondly, in addition to TLR4, other neuroimmune  pathways are likely to contribute to opioid withdrawal.** One of  the possible candidates is the TLR2 pathway, as (+)-naloxone may block  both TLR4 and TLR2 receptors, and recent evidence suggests that morphine  can also mediate neuronal cell function through TLR2 (Li et al., 2010).

2) I went immediately from inpatient to a 90 day program which consisted of housing, a 30 day partial hospitalization program with daily group counseling and weekly individual counseling along with seeing a psychiatrist and addressing my mental health (anxiety and depression) and being prescribed proper medications (currently on wellbutrin, Zoloft, and mirtazapine for sleep) and daily AA/NA meetings... after this 30 day period the last 60 days were intensive out patient which consisted of group counseling 4 days a week, daily AA/NA meetings, and the freedom to get a job

3) after the 90 day program, I had a job, a network of people in AA/NA from attending meetings daily, a sponsor, and proper medications, so I went straight to a sober living house where we still have to go to meetings everyday and have a job to pay rent and supply ourown food... I plan on staying here somewhere between 6-12 months

I love my life so much now, and hope this can serve as a helpful aid for anyone seeking sobriety but clueless as to go about achieving that goal

Somehow I have managed to never exceed a 30mg/day (7.5ish mg per dose spread over the day and night) oxy habit for almost five years years and I can safely say my current addiction severity is exponentially worse than when I was on 30mg/day in 2015. A few factors have contributed to the anomaly of my habit, like a natural low tolerance, a lot of responsibilities, financial constraints, as well as maintaining goals, hobbies, relationships with family/friends, and hope for the future. Additionally, I actually don't find the euphoria in high doses that great as I really only feel good during the come up, as soon as I peak I just feel lethargic and look forward to coming down and resetting, so I am basically living for that 15 minute window of time. That window of time used to be many hours and I was guaranteed to have a great evening and night if I popped something as early as 4 or 5 PM, but, as the return to withdrawl has gotten faster over time, the window of euphoria has gotten smaller and smaller to the point of being a very small fraction of what it used to be.

 I have never experienced hardcore Heroin withdrawl, but the level of discomfort I am at from this mild amount of oxy is scary to me, especially when I wake up every morning in hell and can't do anything until my morning cocktail of oxy and caffeine or vyvanse depending on what I have, is in me. I can no longer get a good sleep as the withdrawl seems to wake me up earlier. So that's just what I wanted to share to maybe give a warning to people like me who thought if they didn't allow their tolerance to rise they would be able to keep the addiction at bay, sorry to say it doesn't work. Luckily I might have a real chance at getting off soon as after being broke for over a year I have spent the last 6 months building a business that I can run online from anywhere, so soon I may be able to afford to take off somewhere for a few weeks and slay the dragon.

Both were extremely underwhelming experienced and I am wondering how to achieve the best effects as not to waste my limited supply.

I was diagnosed with Sarcoidosis almost exactly a year ago and had terrible swelling and joint pain in ankles, knees, fingers, elbows, and wrists.  I was prescribed methotrexate, prednisone, and tramadol and from taking the tramadol for so long until I got my condition under control I became addicted to it. I have taken a range of 6-10 50 mg tablets of tramadol almost daily for almost a year now. I got it from alternative sources for the last 9-10 months. I managed to never take anything stronger during that time even though I had pretty easy access to it.

Things came to a head yesterday and I was confronted by by loved ones and absolutely have to stop cold turkey in order to keep my job and my family.  I rationalized my use as me needing it for my condition but fully understand and realize now I was/am addicted. I took 300 mgs about 26 hours ago and already feel absolutely terrible. Aches, sweats, chills, nausea, diarrhea, depression. 

What can I expect and how long should I expect all of this to go on as far as withdrawing? I am terrified that I almost lost my job and want more than anything to stop as I almost saw my world burn come crashing down before my eyes.

This is just great. Several companies are bringing out really big screen phones this year.  The cool factor is that these guys fold in half. So you have the best of both worlds. Regular size phones for walking around, or tablet size phones when you can sit down and do your reddit.

Samsung has been leaking press releases about this concept for years. I guess they finally pulled it off.

There is the Samsung Galaxy fold. It has a 4.6 inch screen or a 7.3” display in tablet form. It will cost just under 2000.00.

You have the Huawei Mate X, which is a 6.6” phone or an 8” tablet and will sell for about 1980.00.

Yes, you heard that right. About two grand for a fucking phone.

Both phones have latest super fast processors, too much memory that you do not need and awesome cameras to take even better selfies so you can show the world your enlarged pores. They will also have 5g advanced and faster internet so you can see websites even faster than the 2 seconds it takes now. Yawn.

I am not that excited over these phones. I would love to have a 7” display, but 2 grand?

Nah.

How is it that these devices cost 400% more than a regular decent android tablet?

But you are not taking into account R & D costs, realcat.

Sure. I know. Cause Samsung execs are sooo underpaid.

Eventually prices will drop and maybe I will be able to actually see text on my goddam mobile apps. Or, I could drop dead of a heart attack first. Either way,Samsung? 2 grand?

I'm kinda mad because this shit fucked up my low tolerance I had going. I only have to do a small bump of the blue dope to get a good nod. Now when I do very high quality ECP heroin (which she got again because of my recommendations 😊, vs this tar, or this tanish, vinegar smelling, obviously re-rocked tar), 
I have to do a whole point to even feel a little high! Lame! Also, it doesn't have that good of a high, nor does it have any legs (2-4) hours tops. The ECP has 6+ hour legs.

I have a feeling I will be tested tomorrow before I get any refill of medication. I am prescribed hydrocodone so showing positive for opiates is exactly what im suppose to show up for. but will that little amount of oxycodone show up ? do most drs office tests even do 10 panel tests ? because, from what ive read, most tests dont include oxy. but thats my worry. if it does, theyll know for sure I took it vs opiates could be anything 


as for why: its because I had no medication. my doctor left me hanging and said oh well, find a new dr, its for your own good. I just worry that once they see oxy, im done for. I was in the hospital for a few days, about 5 days ago, so I can blame it on that but would it be in my system for 5 days for me to even be able to use that reasoning ? ",1551232392.0

(Suboxone advice needed),"Hello opifam, I have a somewhat rare reason for needing a sub script. I have snowballed my street suboxone use into a  serious dependency both physical and mental. While normally I would be buying oxy, codeine, and hydros to get my fix here and there all my plugs now are incredibly pricey, dodgy, inconsistent and honestly seem like narcs sometimes. So over time I've been accepting subs as payment for my goods. It was only occasional at first but somehow it ended up being something I wanted instead of my everyday meds. So I've gotten to the point to where I've paid 35 per sub tablet many times. Sometimes if I'm sick I'll offer like 15 of my 30mg addys(usually 8+a pop) for ONE single sub. 

What I'm trying to convey is that i can't afford to spend all my money on subs that hardly last me a few days. Maybe I could have had I still had my old plug whod do them for 10 sometimes less(ended up robbing me for 200 in subs) but 35? Can't do it.

I want to ask your opinion because I cant live like this anymore. The insanely high prices, the constant blowing off or getting spun for days just to get my 40 dollar sub. It's just not worth it and I cqnt keep letting these scumbags take advantage of my desperation.

The only thing that is scaring me from trying to get a script is that 1. My mom and sister work at my GP office and they can see my ORS if they want. 2. I'm currently on Gabapentin and Adderall daily as prescribed and I'd be kinda devastated to lose either one of them. 
3. I'm on Medicaid and I'm very broke at the moment so I don't know if there's any place that can take my insurance for a visit and script. 

The final question is; Given those three possible hindrances to my process of getting stable and taking my life back, what would any of you do if you were me and needed a sub script asap in order to not be fucked and have to jump from 8+mg a day to nothing but CT? Any advice is welcomed and appreciated. I don't like to cry out for help but I have half a zubsolv left and after that I have nothing. The withdrawals I've gone through(all of em many times) don't even come close to the long agonizing withdrawal I keep going into with these subs. Thanks guys.

I apologise for posting so much but you guys really know what youre talking about on here. so my dr dropped me over lost / stolen meds as in previous posts. I was able to talk to my previous doctors office who I had seen before him and they said theyd consider taking over my care & writing a script if & only if they had some tangible proof I was no longer seeing him & he wouldnt be providing any more care / scripts. I got a letter and have an appt tomorrow. I have a feeling they will drug test me. I am in extreme pain and the only thing I was able to get was a couple percocet to hold me over until the appt. 

my question is: how long does it stay in your system ? I was in the hospital for a few days about a week ago and was just thinking that if they do test me, I can say thats what I was given in the hospital. I know they may be able to see what I was actually given but at the same time, they screwed up my meds 4 times in the hospital so I could kinda just say it was an error and I was in fact given it. I dont feel comfortable lying but I really had no other choice. any advice ? being honest will get me no where, as ive seen thru reporting my script lost / stolen and being dropped for it.

BUT you can catch a slight buzz, a sense of wellbeing above ""normal mood"" if dosed low enough. Personally i've done this with doses around 0.25-4mg/day, but i felt the ""ceiling""/antagonistic effects starting to take over at 2mg+/day for me.

&#x200B;

I want to share my experiences and i'm curious about what experiences YOU've had. Below i'll share what i've found out by searching and testing myself (testing still ongoing and everything medically related is very individual. So your optimal dose would also have to be tested out by yourself if you're interested.). I succeeded quite well with 0.5mg/day but i was too curious how bigger doses compare so currently i find myself above the ceiling effect. Been experimenting for about a year now with the last few months on way too high doses. First 6 months was quite successful with doses below 2mg/day.

&#x200B;

\- I read about someone who experienced maximum ""buzz"" at 0.5mg/day for daily use. This person claimed he had been using this dose successfully for \~6 months with steady effect. And using the drug for a total of \~2 years.

\- I read about another person who experienced his/her optimal dose to be 1mg/day after 10 years of experience & testing.

\- Personally i managed to get nice effects between 0.25-2mg (sometimes even 4mg, but that's way too much you're just pulling the roof/ceiling-effect on you). This worked well for about 6 months, then i started trying higher doses, i felt the raise from 2mg/day to 4mg/day giving me even more of a buzz, but the ceiling-effect also came closer eventually blocking the effect. Nowadays i'm routinely using big doses just to feel well. But soon enough i'll start tapering down again and find my own sweetspot. I believe it's somewhere between 0.5 and 1.5mg for me. Splitting 4mg into 2x2mg doses each day does sometime give me a slight buzz from one of the halves. I'm sure it has to do with the fluctuation in the blood levels and the pieces not being exactly 50/50 in size resulting in one of the giving a slight buzz for a couple hours.

\- Another option of course is to use a couple days, have a break for a couple of days and it'll always work.  


EDIT: Adding what type of ""buzz"" i'm talking about, what i've managed to feel longterm using low-doses buprenorphine. It's a slight buzz similar to 30-50mg codeine/50mg tramadol (w/o tolerance). It's not much, you barely feel it. But it sure is nice!",1551214762.0

av36s4,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/av36s4/finally_said_fuck_it_and_manned_up/,39,https://redd.it/av36s4,swanzy1,Finally said fuck it and manned up,"For the last almost 3 months I’ve been going through a middle man to get my dope, since I rarely ever take pills anymore and don’t have a relationship with that old plug anymore. 

So it’s been 30 minute each way trips down to the city, to scoop this tweaker and use him for his connects for the dope boys that hangout inside this big ass corner liquor store. (Sounds corny & cliche but this liquor store is actually sweet as fuck and I know the owner is cool and lets dudes trap out of it, so more power to em) 

Obviously, when this all started out it was gravy. You scratch my back, I scratch yours. I’m copping $70-$100 worth, I’ll throw him $10-$25 for some dimes or a couple stones or whatever his little heart may desire...

Over time though, the service from said middle man has declined. Steadily. More demanding, more begging, more excuses when my bags are looking short. I get it, he’s an addict too and this is what you sign up for when you go through a middle man. 

Dudes phone was shut off last week so he had to call the dope boy off of my phone and place the order that way :) 

For a whole week I’m pondering the idea of just contacting this dude on my own, completely going over the MM’s head, who in all reality is still a decent dude. 

So today was the day, after getting all my bills paid I had a nice chunk of change left to play around with and didn’t want it to go to waste, or go towards a shitty amount of dope that I’d be regretting buying 2 days later. So as I’m driving by the MM’s house, I say fuck it and call the dope boy myself. To my surprise, he’s super fucking cool about it! 

I couldn’t believe it at first, he definitely didn’t recognize my voice, and it threw him off to where I feel like he was ABOUT to hang up on me, but once I described who I normally show up with and what I drive (I’m at the spot 1-3 times weekly) he knew exactly who I was. 

Picked him up straight from his home, which we normally never do, whipped him to the corner store for a beer and a shot and got served right there in my car. Took him back to the house and we must have sat outside and bullshitted for a solid 15 minutes. Super fucking nice guy. Wasn’t even mad that I called him myself or anything. He even threw me a couple extra packs for spending what I spent today! Double score! 

So instead of blowing a lot of money and receiving half the worth of dope, on top of throwing the MM a finders fee, I’m just now arriving home with more dope than I’ve ever carried on me, for what I’m considering an awesome price :D 

All because I manned up and said fuck it.

Wether that’s JJ coming through or just plain fate, I’m thankful and hoping y’all have some good news to speak of yourselves! 

Stay safe y’all, much love. 

TL;DR: normally I get raped by my MM for plugging me, decided to call the plug myself and ended up getting hooked tf up, dude was super nice and chill. Score.

av2t2d,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/av2t2d/precipitated_withdrawal_experiences/,6,https://redd.it/av2t2d,tylsergic,Precipitated withdrawal experiences.,"I've tried again and again to look up experiences on this and I've always failed to find people describing the moment where every bit of the opiate is stripped from the receptor by Naloxone, buprenorphine, or any other antagonists/mixed agonist-antagonist. I'll share my experiences with using buprenorphine after morphine. If anybody else has any experiences they would like to share let me know.

I've had kidney stones, I've gone through multiple drug withdrawals at the same time, and I've been morbidly depressed for a majority of my life among other things. Nothing compares to the pain of PWs. Although it may be brief I'd rather detox for days than ever go though that bullshit again. 

The first time I experienced them I was using 300-600mg of morphine IV for 3 weeks. Well the morphine was running low but I had Suboxone. So I planned to transition like I had done a million times before. Before I had always snorted my sub in small doses way after in order to avoid PWs. I never had them as long as I waited at least 12-16 hours and used small amounts of sub at a time.

I had woken up after using about 300mgs+ of IV morphine the day before. All of the fresh shots done before 7 p.m. However I had the last week's worth of cottons that I had eaten at about 9 p.m which obviously had plenty of morphine left in them because it made me pass out around 11. I slept as long as I possibly could and ended up sleeping till 4 because the withdrawals were absolutely killing me. I was sweating, vertigo, chills, aches and pains, etc.

I felt so bad I just threw 2mg in a spoon drew it up and injected in my bathroom. I never felt anything from IV sub it would just kick in sooner. I was weirded out first by and intense smell of burning hair mixed with the orange. I will remember that God awful smell the rest of my life. Then I proceeded to feel intense vertigo and dizziness that made me want to sit down. As soon as I sat down I felt a rush that was everything an opiate rush wasn't. Pure hell. Goosebumps enveloped my skin and my hair was standing straight up. The most intense chills would start at the top of my spine and roll down to the bottom bringing my arms chills with it. It felt like I was sorrounded by ice. As soon as the chills went away I would get an intense hotflash that acted in the same way as the chills. Both would interchange between chills and hot flashes. As this is going on my arms and legs feel like are being ripped apart and flailing them is the only natural reaction I can do. My head has very painful pins and needles but instead of them feeling very little and all over the place I feel like hellraisor. They just stay in the same place going in and out. A fetal position is all I can muster while swaying back and forth. These were just the physical symptoms but the mental side was just as bad if not worse.

My anxieties were racing. I felt like I was on 1g of meth and a pot of coffee while going through benzo withdrawal. My first thought was will it go away or will there be irreparable damage. This faded as everything and everyone I saw on TV I hated with a passion. My self perspective was the worst. I hated my self and started thinking of every mistake or slightly embarrassing moment with complete shame and disgust. My mind started to cycle through all these moments. Every fraction of a second something would come up. It didn't matter what time it occurred. I actually felt shame because of embarrassing things that happened when I was 8 up until the age I was of 22. They would just pop up one after another every half second like your life flashing before your eyes. It was like a day of the worst withdrawals imaginable packed into 15 minutes. The 15 minutes feels like a 2 hours. When it was over I swear I would still feel like complete and utter shit for a full 24 hours. I normally don't get the best relief from sub for the first couple of days. After PWs I would get zero relief. Idk if it's possible that this reaction can damage the receptors or what but I would feel off for 1-2 days.

I had one more experience where I was adding crystal into an Adderall reshot that had units in them while having done morphine 3 hours before. I had forgotten there was also half of a 4mg Subutex shot in it. I felt the speed then complete disaster as all that started but the mental anguish was further exasperated by the amphetamines. Needless to say I spent 20 minutes crying in a fetal position.

I've learned my lesson after these couple of times and I'll only snort buprenorphine afterwards in tiny amounts with a lot of time in between. It feels like the most unnatural thing ever. Nobodies brain chemistry is ever supposed to be that messed up. I definitely think I received trauma to a degree from it. If I smell burning hair it instantly makes me nervous. To even look at Suboxone while I'm on morphine makes me sick.

Anyway, Oxy has always been my DOC which started out blowing like 1/4th a 30 every couple days turning into a full out binge and experiencing my first heavy withdrawal symptoms 2 weeks ago.. which I got thru and decided to just binge again... anyway, iv recently been able to get some 8MG dilaudids for $5-$10 a pop but only a few at a time. Snorting these was typically my ROA but noticed they weren’t hitting me as hard as I’d expect them to. (My oxy habit was 30-90MG a day with some days only doing 10-20MG with occasional 1-5 day breaks with Suboxone/no sub- with my heaviest usage lasting about 2 months) My tolerance to opiates is built up some but the effects from the dillies were bare to non and just had me feeling well. Until today, After constant lurking, researching and self battle I made the decision. The decision that has me feeling bliss and the warmth I used to get from oxys when my habit first started. I crushed up 8MG, put a small line to the side to blow because I enjoy the feeling and mixed the rest with 2ML of water, grabbed my oral syringe and shoved it up my unwelcoming unexpected bootyhole which I’m sure felt violated. I pushed the syringe about halfway deep and injected the water dilly cocktail and clenched like iv been holding a steamer in for 48hrs. I went back downstairs and after 5 minutes was kind of worried I wasted it and it was absorbed by some hidden lurking turd up there but I was wrong. After 10 minutes I felt it, the bliss that was long gone - The warmth and comfort that took me in the first time. I see posts all the time about ROA for dilaudids for those who don’t IV (Which I will not do for reasonings of having a heavily addictive personality).

Tell me again how this works?,"I have been reading up on addiction research, because I would really like to understand why this is such a hard problem to solve.  How does it work?

Because I am reading that it is about chemicals in my brain. They call ‘em neurotransmitters. Drugs release them, stuff like dopamine.

That is a chemical that controls how rewards work. I do some coke, release dopamine, feel awesome, the reward center in my brain is activated, so now, naturally, I want more.

Simple. I buy more coke, do it, get more dopamine, etc etc.

So you can watch youtube and see that we have it all figured out.

But wait a minute. Too much dopamine makes me feel like shit. I am anxious. Nervous. I just want to feel better.

Obviously coke is not a good way to do this. I need some heroin to calm down.

Heroin, you see, is an opiate. Opiates affect the neurotransmitters called endorphins. They help change your perception of pain, as in feel none.

If you exercise, your body releases endorphins, which make you not depressed and happy. You get a reward for exercise.

Hold up, I thought dopamine did the reward thing?

Now it gets even weirder. Cause serotonin is the chemical that is supposed to mediate happiness, anxiety and mood. It stops you from being depressed.

Ok, now you are just fucking with me.  You just said dopamine motivates you to seek out and achieve pleasure. That it would make you happy. And too much dopamine makes you anxious. But serotonin does this stuff?

Hmm, confusing.

Also, there is the neurotransmitter called Gaba. It chills out the nervous system. It regulates anxiety and other things.

Didn’t we just say that dopamine affects anxiety levels? Too much dopamine can even excite you to death. And what about endorphins? Take that dope away and you are guaranteed to get anxious.

There are other neurotransmitters. Acetylcholine, glutamate, norepinephrine and more. You don't even want to know what these ones bring to the table, because then you are going to cuss me out and tell me to stop this bullshit.

Then there are hormones, which are also chemicals but another type of beast. Some, like testosterone, can make you feel aggressive, happy and powerful.

Hmm, that is funny cause I thought neurotransmitters did that. I thought they controlled your mood and made you feel good.

Yes, well you see, it is complicated.

Yes, complicated as fuck. I do not believe there is a single human being on earth that is capable of really understanding what is going on at this point.

Maybe a computer could do it, because there are some really powerful ones. The problem with that idea is that computers require human programmers.

But humans require exact, logical data and rules to write code. Data that we apparently do not have. So that won’t work. At least right now.

So we are left with many, many paradoxes. Some people can taper off addictive amounts of opiates in 3 or 4 days, pain free and be fine. Some people try for months to taper off and still have to kick hard at the end. Wtf? How does that work?

Good old mama nature never, ever, does things the easy way. Which is normally a good thing or we would all probably still be one cell organisms floating in a pond somewhere. Evolution is trial and error and increasing levels of complexity.

This stuff is just not that easy to understand and there is definitely information missing from the puzzle. Maybe we will figure it out in the future. I don’t think we will be able to fix addiction until we do.",1551190337.0

So while strolling through the fields tonight, I saw some very low priced Oxy IR of a dosage I've never seen before. Looks like they're unmarked yellow circles in blister packs, and are listed at 40mg. Previously, I had only been aware of 40mg being available as XR, so I was pretty curious as to what these were.

After some Sherlocking, it seems these are endocodil, a Mexican pharma brand. From what I hear, there's a tamper-proof coating to prevent snorting, however the coating has been described as similar to the old OCs, and can therefore be remedied pretty easily.

My ROA for Oxy is always oral (better BA and I just don't like snorting in general). I typically take mboxes and the like, so not used to dealing with tamper coating. If these are truly IR and I'm going oral, do I care about the coating, like, at all? Will it take longer to start working, similarly to what I've heard about XR?

I'd love to hear some firsthand experience with these. I was only able to find bits and pieces of info about them, and only a couple of posts here, with very little feedback from those who have taken them. Any differences in the high or silly shit like that, or is it just straight up the same?

I did harvest some from the fields, and should be able to provide my own experience in a couple of days, but I'd like to have the most data possible about it before going all pacman on them, so I figured I'd ask some questions in the interim. I will say, if they're 1:1 legit, this will def be the new hotness for me, less than half the price of any other legit pharma IRs I've found. ",1551180215.0

Opinions?,"So I have been using for about 5 years, and just in the last month it has started to get a bit out of hand. I'm seeing that I am using when I really don't want to be.

So anyway, I figure it's time to get some help in the form of pharmacotherapy. At this stage I'm thinking of going on a suboxone program. I'm actually really excited about it.

I feel like my heroin usage isn't too high, and I really don't want to be addicted to suboxone but I figure if I keep going this way my heroin use will be stupid high and it will be worse than the suboxone addiction will be anyway. I really wish you didn't have to go on a 'program', and instead could just have suboxone on hand for whenever I feel the urge to use heroin. Instead, they insist I become addicted to suboxone to get a script at all. 

I'm looking for people with experience with suboxone to share their knowledge, negative or positive, with suboxone.

Peace and love people, stay safe.",1551174902.0

I'm at a loss. I waited the right amount of time, I felt better when it kicked in so I know I didn't precipitate withdrawal.
Regardless, the urge to use is strong. I just want to fucking sleep. My habit is at around .4g a day, and I took an 8 mg sub.
I am miserable with gooseflesh, hot flashes and cold sweats, and the worst muscle tension ever. Should I take more subs?

Edit: For anyone else in this situation that sees this post, the people in the comments were right. I took subs every 2 hours till I felt better, which amounted to 16mg. I still felt pretty shit, so I waited 12 hours and took more Suboxone. Still felt like shit for a while, but after 22 hours after I'd taken the first dose, I feel like I did before I even took them. 

Oh, I still can't fucking sleep though, but I don't think this is a usual experience. I think anyone that doesn't have preexisting insomnia issues would be able to sleep at this point

**So, have you been noticing any weird dissociation effects or cannabinoid effects?  Has the fent feeling changed?  Are bags still just as ""hot""?**

&#x200B;

I'm well aware that Fent is being made and coming up from Mexico now, but I think thats being distributed in a different way to different people.   I think things are going to get weird on the streets for a bit unless someone is still supplying easily and directly without having to know a ton of people.  I also know there are some fent labs in the US here and there, but I also don't think its going to replace the huge amount that was being bought from china.    


I mean, how long can all the kilos last that were purchased?  Ive read in some invite only forums that some pill pressers are running low on Fent-HCL, A-fent, Fu-f, etc and aren't quite sure what to do next.   


Thoughts?  Even just a direct answer from people in the area would be cool?

He was extremely transparent as in they are not in a relationship and he cannot handle being in one. she said since she was in recovery from being addicted to heroine she cannot handle a relationship either. Me and my friend J are not opiate users. Well tonight my friend J told M that while they are very good friends he doesn’t have feelings for her in a romantic way, since she has been hinting on going on dates and such. She got extremely mad/upset and went and bought a bag and used. directly after she called my friend to tell him it was his fault and that she relapsed because of him. now my friend feels extremely trapped and is scared to do anything because he doesn’t want her to do anything stupid. Has anyone dealt with anything like this before??? I care deeply about my friend and don’t want him to feel this way. I also don’t want the girl to feel so bad that she’s using. I mean i think if it was that easy to tip her into a relapse she shouldn’t have gotten involved w anyone, romantic or not. but i could sound very ignorant from being an outsider to addiction. if anyone has any advice on how to approach this it would be really appreciated by me and j. thank you in advance ",1551156532.0

Allies used to say that even if given the opportunity to assassinate him they should never do it bc his incompetence was such an asset to the allied war effort. He was the 1 that let the British escape at dunkirk. He also dressed really insanely. He was a fat incompetent nazi bitch but sometimes I like to fantasize about being in a position like his.

My fucking gums are bruised and bleeding, and my damn tooth is throbbing like a bitch. How the hell can I make this shit stop? Norco wont touch the pain, and I’m hoping Tylenol will work. What else can I take for it? Also would I even have a chance of getting the dentist to prescribe anything worthwhile? I don’t think so, but you never know. ",1551140758.0

For some reason the past 3 mouth swabs I did for them all came back negative for bupe, and despite every UA I've done always coming back positive they kicked me out. I dont understand. I always took my meds as prescribed, went to every class and appointment they wanted me too. I was doing so well. Havent touched heroin for almost a year thanks to the subs. I feel so fucking defeated. I cried like a fucking baby when the doctor told me. I'm devastated. I feel lost. Up until I started subs I had struggle on and off for almost 12 yrs with IV heroin use. It was like a fucking miracle for me. I've done inpatient programs, out patient, psych meds, the works and none of it stuck like that shit did.

I was mixing up my shit when I noticed he left his digi. So I called him and he asked me to meet him at the nearby Target. I met him went inside to wash my hands and I knew it wasn’t smart but I can’t use at home (my wife thinks I’ve been clean for two years) so I Made the fateful decision to shoot up in my car before leaving. It was about ten PM. I noticed my connect still going around meeting people. And after about 20 minutes I saw him get in a car right across the aisle from me. I tied off my left wrist and tried to hit in my hand. I had my dome light and my IPhone light on  to show the whole world what I was doing. I couldn’t hit my hand so as I went into my wrist I looked up and saw my connect get out of his customers car and walk towards me. After he passed me my radio display went off in my car connected to my phone that he was calling. I thought I had registered so I didn’t answer. I don’t know what happened next if they just opened the door or if I saw their light but the next thing I knew cops were opening the door and shouting at me to drop the needle. They pulled my out of the car yanked the tourniquet off , handcuffed my hands behind my back and dragged me to a car. There were three cars and three cops searched my car while three questioned me. Cops are really paranoid about getting stuck so the cop searching me kept asking if I had anything in my pockets and I kept assuring him I only had my keys wallet phone. He knelt down behind me to empty my pockets and I said I’m sorry this is weird but I really have to fart so I’m going to turn around and back a few feet away. What?! A cop asked are you serious. I repeated myself and said I’m sorry but I don’t want you to smell it back there. I did as I said I would and then they told me to sit on the bumper. I felt like crying. I had gotten my wallet stolen and I had an old expired license and a temporary paper one so my sister had to rent the car, so they were probably going to impound it. I was going to jail and I didn’t even know if we had enough money for bail or if my wife would even bail me out. I took a deep breath and was honest with the cops. How long have you been using heroin? A couple years. What are you doing down here’s dropping something off for work. And you thought it would be a good idea to just shoot up before you went home. No I knew it was a bad idea. Look there isn’t an excuse I’m not trying to justify this. I’m in a method program ... it doesn’t look like it’s doing any good. No I have been good but I’ve had a rough couple of years and the last month has been really tough. What’s all the equipment in the car for. Well that’s why it’s been so hard my truck has been in the shop for a month and I couldn’t even afford to rent a truck so I rented this car. Look I know everyone must say ok I just wanted one last time yeah right. But really I just slipped up recently and I know this isn’t the answer but my brain tells me I’ll feel better. I’ve made an appointment to see a therapist and get back on my medication and I was using until then. One of the cops came up with a meth pipe and asked me where the meth was. I don’t have any. I have a pipe sure but I don’t have any speed. Going through my wallet they must have seen my needle exchange card but never mentioned it. They ran my record and saw I had been busted for possession like a year and a half ago, cited but not arrested. We talked some more and I was brutally honest with them. Look growing up I was pretty anti drug but I’ve had depression as long as I can remember. And again this isn’t an excuse. I was molested as a child my parents hit me. They divorced and then my dad really started beating me. My mom died. So one day I tried heroin and then I didn’t have to think about the things I didn’t want to think about that made me sad ... it “worked” I made air quotes with my hands which is hard to do with your when behinds uh the oof I I your back for a couple years I never got sick, but I’m so after I got off my medication i suddenly started doing it every day. Instantly addicted. so you just went right into heroin? Why didn’t you try smoking weed? This came from a black cop. Look I know this sounds crazy because I do heroin but weed just makes me sleepy. So maybe you should get back on your medication because this isn’t going to be good for you. It’s going to cost you money, you’re going to go to jail. It’s not good. Look I never thought I would be doing heroin growing up and again let me say there isn’t an excuse to use it, but it’s sad it’s everywhere. And I need to get cleaned up first but I want to one day speak at schools or something and if I can get one kid not to make my mistakes then I might feel better about what I’ve done. A couple officers wished me good luck and left. This is getting long so I’ll cut the the chase. I wasn’t arrested, my car was not impounded I was cited for misdemeanor possession of heroin, and misdemeanor paraphernalia. The last cop incurred me and handed me the ticket and told me you need to call an Uber. Why? Look you were just injecting heroin I can’t have you driving impaired. I didn’t inject Anything, check the needle no blood in there. Look I’m trying to give you a break ok. Fair enough can I call
Someone to pick me up? After twenty minutes he got a call and had to go and warned me one last time not to drive. I waited another hour and kept calling my connect but he wouldn’t answer, and then I left and drove home. My connect asked me the next day if I was trying to set him up. Why? Because I’ve never heard of anyone getting caught with a needle in their arm and not going to jail. So there’s my story. Has anyone else been caught and not gone to jail?

I’m very aware of the danger that these 2 CNS depressants combined can have, however I genuinely don’t enjoy oxycodone on its own that much.

I feel dosing then drinking 4 beers or so after it makes the high much more euphoric compared to just dosing the oxy which I don’t feel any significant euphoria from.

I know I get legit oxy 100% so I’m confused at why this is.

Well that was fun, started partying a lot, just the teenage lifestyle. Well I had started smoking pot everyday not thinking it of anything. Well as a lot of us Know weed eventually became boring and just a habbit. I started drinking just socially and found my way into pills too... First it was just popping em, then I started, crushing them with drinks, then snorting them. Then one day I was at a friends house and he brought out some coke and I was like ""oh holy sh*t, wonder what this is like"". We poured some on the table and each did about a line and a half, I felt the best and energized I ever had. Time went on, I Went into highschool still smoking pot and doing a lil bit of coke now and then. Well of course that got boring too. That was when my life started going down hill... I found meth. First time I used meth (at 17) I did a skinny line and immediately felt the best I had ever felt in the world. I felt like a could run around the whole world in one night, everything just felt right and figured out. Well obviously I kept using it all the time. I started losing my morals I had set. I would do anything just to feel some sort of high, Steal, Lie, Hide. I would stay up days at a time almost as if I would set a contest for myself to see how tweaked up I could get.

Currently I'm in a halfway house.  My stay here is a nightmare and i will start with the general bullshit that effects everyone in my house,  its become more and more restroctive over the years to the point where coming from a long term rehab program to this halfway house was litteraly a step backwards in terms of how long I can be away from the house and attending meetings and what not. When i first got here I was put on a two week blackout period where I wasn't allowed to leave the house except for outpatient.  Even to attend a meeting.  this was made exceptionally dull as they dont have any programing here what so ever and only one tv in the house (as well as this your not allowed to have your own)  if I didnt have my phone and guitar I would have surely relapsed out of being bored and while I did have these things many people arrive here with nothing ... No phone no tablet no anything ... Litteraly just the clothes on their back.  Those people are forced to sit here and quite litterly stare at the walls or watch tv for two weeks straight.  Your not allowed to have any food or beverages in the house either (only in the kitchen) not even a waterbottle.  Also they have a system for medication where sometimes you can wait over an hour standing in line to get it.  Surely this sounds like a recipie for disaster and i am only listing a few things, mainly my biggest pet peeves.  The rules in this place are stacked to the brim.  There is a rule for almost anything you can think of and a way they expect you to do it.  Now even though I dont agree with these rules I follow them to a t because I have a daughter that I dont want to be stopped from seeing.  Possibly the only good thing about this place is that even though you only get 20 hours out of the house a week after your off the blackout is that after a month you can infact leave for passes over the weekend.  I have my daughter every weekend so this is something I look forward to.  I go over to my moms house every Friday and spend the weekend with my kid.  This brings me to my current situation.  This particular house has a very tight smoking policy.  They have a specific area right at the border of the property where you are supposed to smoke.  This is my only weekness as now twice while walking twoards this area i have gotten caught by staff lighting my ciggarette before i get there.   The first time they wrote me up for it no body even mentioned it to me... It wasnt brought to my attention until two and a half weeks later on a Friday afternoon before i was about to go on pass to see my daughter.  My pass had been filled out since that Wednesday yet nobody said a thing ... When it was finally brought to my attention at the last miniute Before I was going to leave I got upset obviously as i was being told that i couldnt stay over night last min. And i would need to find a baby sitter for my daughter or cancel the plans all together.  Now they are fully aware of my situation and how it works.  When i got upset they said i have an attitude problem because i slightly raised my voice and got frustrated and dropped a few f bombs. Whatever.  I followed there rules and didnt spend the night at my moms house and my mom was able to care for my daughter while I was gone for the night. Come today I get woken up and told i left the house too early and am never supposed to leave before 8 am. This has never before been mentioned to me, people litteraly leave sometimes as early as 530 to get methadone and when I asked other residents AND STAFF EVEN they said that it wasn't true.  So of course  I am frustrated right from the start.  Then next i get told that I got another write up for lighting my cig. On the property (now this time i really didnt, it was off the property and i am sure of it).  I am trying to just accept it and explain to her I didnt realize i was on the property and she keeps interupting me and will not let me finish, talking down to me like a child.  The whole thing escalated and I was accused over and over again of having a bad attitude and being ""verbally assaultive"" to staff.  What she means is I spoke in an agitated tone and dropped a few frustrated f bombs.  It ended with her cutting me off every time i try to speak, saying that she refused to talk to me and i needed to go calm down and that tommorow i would have to sign a contract saying that if I didnt stop being disrespectful to staff I would be kicked out.  She litterally picked apart everything i said and twisted every word I said all while talking down to me like i was a piece of shit.  What they mean by disrespectful is that i got upset when they told me i couldnt see my daughter next weekend because i lit my cig. To close to the property.  Any time I got upset or disagreed with her she accused me of being ""verbally assaultive"" and disrespectful.  I personally dont understand how they can threaten people with discharge for getting upset and swearing a few times.  How is that ok?  Also when I say I swore i mean that I swore while talking and describing things.  I never swore at her.  I never called her names or disrepected her.  I used a few curse words so that i could describe how frustrated i was.  Now I'm at risk of getting kicked out of this place and even though I dont want to be here... Right now I need to be... There is more to it than that.  I have been told by the one single staff member that is an actual human being here that they talk about me in case conference and in the back office ... They talk about what they think my religious view are stating specifically that ""i might be in a cult"" and that they are scared of me and all sorts of other negative shit about me that he wouldnt repeat.  The reason being is i often wear band tshirts with inverted pentagrams or other stanic Imagery, have a baphomet phone pop and also often hang artwork I do in my room that reflects this and have a baphomet statue and what not.  Now I dont want this staff member to get into trouble so there is now way i would out him ... But I am certain I am being persecuted for my beliefs ... There is more to it than this that leads me to think so but this is already long as fuck.  I just dont know what to do and am extremely frustrated.  I seriously follow all the rules even if I hate them because i dont want to not be able to have my daughter for the weekend.  Now thats being taken away from me over bullshit.  Its not right and I really think they are trying to force me out of here because they dont like me/what I believe in and because they dont understand it.  There are people here who break multiple rules a day and get multiple write ups a day and even they are not on contract.  People have relapsed and they let them stay.  Now I am being threatend with discharge for a few f bombs and not agreeing with them.  I'm open to any suggestions on what to do even if its negative spit it at me...

I've posted in the past but, like most of you my addiction started innocently. I have acute crohns disease and a partially collapsed spines that cuts the nerves to my left leg almost completely off.

I had surgery removing a large amount of my small intestines, my illeum and gallbladder. I was put on oxy 20s 6 times a day for 16 weeks and I couldn't stop for about 3 years. I was told I'm a perfect methadone candidate because it lasts longer and would help control my pain. No one told me about the reality till it was too late.

I found out within a month that they don't want you better, they want your money and want you to always come back.

I decided to just cut it off, took my Sunday take home and the following Monday started my detox of not going. I knew what withdrawal was like, but never realized that methadone was a different beast.

I went through it all. Not sleeping 3-4 days in a row and when I did sleep it was for maybe 3 hours. The pain came back so intense I couldn't do much but curl in a ball. The random crying was embarrassing and immasculating, I couldn't go out in public; but the worst was the fluctuating body temp especially with the severe sciatica. I can't stand it not being 80° and when I was normal 70 was perfect.

I can't say I'm better but I'm getting there. My neurontin is helping a lot, but I'm mostly out of the woods.

I want everyone to know that its hell. Its probably the worst experience you'll have, but when that clarity of mind starts to form and you realize that life still goes on things are shown in much brighter colors.

If you have experience with this I'm all ears, especially if anyone can help with my feet feeling like they're in a frozen lake 24/7. I'm tired of running to the bathtub just to soak my feet to warm them only to have it come back 25 mins later.

I don't know where I'm going here, but I want you all so know you CAN make it. You can get off and you CAN get clean. Its hard. It sucks. Its hell. Its also completely worth it. I nearly lost my marriage, and now I have the clarity to love and be loved properly again.",1551119335.0

Now, I've been clean from opiates going on 2-3 years (this sub got me off my lope addiction after I quit heroin, thanks you guys). Recently, I had a rotten tooth break in half and it's been killing me, but I don't have any connects and I'm on papers so I gotta be careful so I don't violate.

I work at a redemption center, and people treat their can bags like it's a garbage sometimes. Being the ex junkie I am, sometimes I find empty pill bottles a d I always gotta check them after the customer leaves... In over a year I've never got anything worthwhile but that shit changed today muhfuckas!

Normally if I check pill bottles, I have to be careful because our security cameras are on point and I was on thin ice for the whole ""drinking vodka all day errday at work"" thing, but the power is out so the cameras aren't working... Dude brought in an order and I notice a pill bottle, but I don't understand how he didn't see it.

I paid him and he left and as I pick it up, I can feel there are some pills in it... Turn it to see the name... Hydrocodone/apap, 5-325. There were 18 out of the original 20 of the cute little fuckers in there and the expiration date was last year so I don't think anyone will be missing them.

50 mg of hydro with no opiate tolerance later and this motherfucker is walking on motherfuckin suuuuunnnnnnssssshhhhiiiinnnneeee muhfuckas.

Also, I just got tested for probation, so I didn't have to wait to take any.... Gonna eat the other 8 in a few hours.

Also, I'm at 147 days without drinking so that's cool.

It's not a huge come up or anything, but I'm pumped about it. Gonna enjoy the buzz, the slow day at work, and jam out on guitar! Love you fuckers and hope you guys are feeling as good as I am.

All my friends think opiates are bad and don‘t like their effects but I have litetally tried every drug and a few research chemicals and I can say that opiates are by far the best drug out there. The feeling of pure serenity and joy the absolute calmness and the extremely high body sensetivity are just so far away from anything any other drug does that I just can‘t get away from
them. I am not a daily user I sometimes
binge then stop them binge again but there is nothing that compares to opiates. I just feel so centered and right and calm and down and secure. 

I will one day atone for my sins I know and I know it‘s a slippery slope with addictiin etc. But no drug compares to opiates. 

I really don‘t understand my friends yeah I can understand that they worry about addiction etc but you really

No brainer right??? Well not really...I know I can’t do pills forever and the good angel on my shoulder is screaming “this is your way out”, the little devil on my shoulder is screaming “GIRL...this would take away the best priced pills I’ve ever encountered ( $7.50 for 20mg crushable oxy and $20 for 80mg OPs) and potentially lead me down the road of $30 blues!”  

I’m in my early 30s and want to start a family with my fiancé and have a normal life....but I’ve been sober before and it sucked ass....I’ve tried being on only antidepressants to no avail. 

Also, I have no knowledge about how the drug testing works..I’m a girl and he’s a guy...will that automatically be directed?? Also if they do know it isn’t his pee, can they get my DNA out of it?? This whole situation isn’t making my so comfortable...

TL:DR should I give my plug (male and I’m female) my pee for his PM pee test? Perk: it would basically force me to quit! Downside: I could potentially end up spending 30 on blues instead of the ridiculously good price I get from him ($7.50 for crushable 20mg oxy and $25 for 80mg OPs)

I think about that. Like an entire city, laid to waste. What a fucking slaughter.

I knew a few of these people. Once in a while, here on r/opiates, we get the news of someone passing. Remember that cannon going off in hunger games? It reminds me of that.

It is hard for me, personally, to think about people who could have been my friends, wiped out by a pharmaceutical grim reaper. It is human nature to want to blame someone. So I am thinking docs, dopeboys, drug companies, mexicans, chinese.

I am new to H but I have been or average 200mg of Tramadol and for extreme neuropathic pain for the past 5 years. Sometimes I go up to 300mg but never beyond as it makes me feel like I have to throw up.

&#x200B;

I'll be honest, I never fancied H and the high from H in general. But since I got used to Tramadol and because I have also taken anti depressants for the nerve damage for the same amount of years, that has fucked up my natural balance and getting high on any stimulants like coke or speed will leave me with an uncontrolled strong anxiety for a minimum of 4 days. That has never happened before taking these meds.

&#x200B;

So yes, I do want to get high sometimes and decided to play around with something I sort of know and my body is accustomed to it, given that I am always on opioids-like.

&#x200B;

However when smoking it, it doesn't really seem I get much of a high unless I smoke at least 0.3mg. Now I get I might be having some mildly weak gear, but for fuck sake smoking 0.3mg of gear in one shot seems a ton to me. So I begun considering plugging it if high is same or close to IV.

As most of you know I've been sober for about 2 years now using a methadone maintenance program. I'm currently in the process of titrating down my methadone dose and am down to about 50mg/day.

At the moment I'm hospitalized for a painful injury and they have me on 4mg hydromorphone po q2h prn. I'm finding it not very effective at relieving any of the pain and I'm wondering if this is because of the methadone (which the hospital is continuing to administer during my stay). Before I ask for a bump in pain meds I just want to make sure this isn't my old junkie brain just trying to get more and more, but it really isn't working. It's been about a week now and last night the pain was so bad that I took to old habits and railed one of the pills because bioavailability is higher intranasally for dillaudid according to the chart in the sidebar and while i did not get high or much of a rush, it did finally relieve some pain.

Just hoping to getting some insight before I speak with my pain team later today. I tried talking about it with a couple of nurses but they're not experienced with methadone so weren't much help. To them 4mg of dillaudid seems like a lot (lol).",1551094818.0

I used Tramadol in the past for pain and for getting off Roxicodone. I never had to pay for a single one, ever. There was no market for them at the time. Now, I'm seeing on Reddit and on YouTube where people love these pills so much they are get addicted to them.

Anyway, my question to all of you is, do you believe the following is a good deal, is it the normal price, or is it a rip off?

My acquaintance told me she has 120 Tramadol 50mg tablets for sale at 50 cents (USD) a piece.

If you choose to get out and clean good for you, if you realize thats not for you then you need to get serious about your drug habit. I'm not kidding this will save you YEARS and money you'd have otherwise wasted hemming and hawwing back and forth in and out and ruined careers, life etc.

&#x200B;

If you're in you need to have plan A through Z on WD issues, multiple stockpiles of methadone tabs or bupe. Try out a lot of shit when you have the luxury because one day you might not, everything from phenibut to low dose RC stims to see how that goes.

&#x200B;

You should honestly be thinking years in advance, and its not too hard to lay down years worth of bupe with a legit script but claiming you need 32mgs a day or whatever. I'd honestly have multiple stashes in multiple locations if possible, non-drug using family or parents often have dwellings wink wink.

&#x200B;

Your goal really should be 0 days of forced WD, and never doing something retarded like losing a career over WD.

A lot of people approach addiction haphazardly and with all the conviction of a middle schooler buying a girly mag and then tossing it at the side of the road because they are afraid it will be found, only to buy another when the urge overtakes them.

Then slowly after I got tired of the middle man routine and middle went to jail so I got the plug number straight.

This was both good and bad, my initial use started as smoking tar September 2017 however by November I was using the pick and was all in. I got the direct hookup connection in January 2018 and was full swing ahead. I didn't think it could get worse and my tolerance was mageable, however my girlfriend found out and I vowed to join the methadone program in town. 

Well the methadone got up to 65 mgs, so naturally I started doing amphetamines to stay up and not get sleepy. 

So now I'm hooked on both and my breaks leaving to go to the car and use or go pick up 40 mins away during the work day, as well as my overall attitude and fervor, were starting to get noticed as I had been a very high performer at my job who was seemingly now checked out.

The hr at the firm got involved and provided me a resource to get detox and treatment all while still being paid by work. Ok, although super embarrassing, I'm down to try.

 
So now I'm 2 hours away from home in this detox room at the local hospital and I feel ok, just scared about relapsing in the future.

augum0,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/augum0/fun_and_trouble/,4,https://redd.it/augum0,Waiting_on_a_Corner,Fun and Trouble,"It was a Saturday night, Val invited me to come hang out, and Val equals fun and trouble. So unquestioningly I agreed, after all I was cooped up here at my parents. 


I met Val at her grandparents house to begin our night. First things first, Val made us each a wine spritzer, while I chopped up 4 5mg oxys on the counter and chewed on a spare 1mg Kpin.


“So what's the plan for tonight?” I asked, wincing as I ripped the two bigger lines. 


Val sipped her drink and accepted the bill I handed her


“Well I gotta go up to Jonathan's house and take care of the dogs. Then we could go to a bar on our way back” she said, rubbing her nose.


I agreed and that was the plan we followed. 


When we arrived at Jonathan's she fed the dogs and I raided the bathrooms searching for lost opiates or benzos. Drinking Jonathan's lemonade vodka, I think about how sweet it would have been to find a bottle of Roxies. Instead I chopped pill after pill, of 5mg oxys into lines.


‘oh well’ I think while I do another 20mg line. God damn… I point Val to a 7mg ish line for her.


“I don't want you to OD on me, play it careful you're new.” She knows I'm lying to cover my own deep addictions. Instead of calling me on it she, “let what does not matter truly slide”. Besides she likes fucked up me, and I like fucked up Val.


Val had another 10mg line and I finished the 20ish mg left on the counter.


“Why do you always do so much?” Val turned and asked smoking a magically appearing cigarette.


“Well I've been doing this for a while, and after a while you use more.” I said, as I felt the familiar warmth grow from deep with me. Euphoria beauty invaded my mind, as Val passed the cigarette. 


With the cocktail of oxy, alcohol, Klonopin, MAOI's and tar, I was feeling good. Everything melted into peace, love, and opiate apathy. I was ready to go out and party, after double checking my pocket for my container of oxys three times.


Val decided the bar for her and I to go to, tacky decor, a traditional bar, a big T.V., pool tables, and the bar equivalent of a Chili's. It was ok, at least the drinks were cheap.


At the bar we got two house rum double shots, a Red Oak and an Amber Ale Cider. We cheered to the night, slamming our rum. I chase down my shot with the Red Oak and begin prepping a pool table. Sipping on her cider, Val watches me in her predatory way. Always watching like a cat with a mouse, debating how to play with it.


Playing pool we talk trash about life, between turns I gently stroked her lower back. At the end of her successful turn, a high five quickly became a deep kiss. We played like this for two rounds, one ball, one kiss. 


Sitting out on the porch drinking beer #4, we smoked her Marlboro Reds. Every time there was a lull in conversation, like magnets, our eyes met and a kiss was exchanged. Soon it was apparent we needed to get to her place quick. Trying to conceal my boner I carried my jacket in front of me following Val.


At Val's we instantly began caressing each other, under the thin guise of getting into more comfortable clothes. With a record on we could still be heard a block away, lust engulfed us in pleasure. 


Opiates and sex are amazing together, like sex on sex and after two sessions we lay naked on her bed smoking out he window. Completely  exhausted, I try to hold onto consciousness, but the opiates are heavy. Instead I lay with my head in her lap, sharing another cigarette and a new drink.


When Val gets up to go to bathroom I chew up another 20mg of oxy. I'm already touching heaven but I want to be engulfed in its pleasure. She comes back and straddles me, wearing my shirt, black lace panties, and again I marvel at her form. Short, thin, with perfectly proportioned curves. Her dark beautiful hair laid on me right as the opiates took me to heaven. 


As much as I want to ask what we were doing, her gentle caress of my cheek took me away. Back to reality from the clouds, back to her, us, and this moment. After another session Val laid with her head on my chest stroking my arm. I lay in the opiate induced ecstasy that that washed over my brain.


‘If only this could last forever’ I think to myself as I shut my eyes.

Personally I've done suboxone more times than I can count, but never subetex or any other product that doesn't have naloxone included. This is what I'm curious about specifically:


When taking suboxone sublingually, with no tolerance, in order to get high, you don't feel much of an effect at all until about 45 min after taking it, and it takes a full 2 hours for the effect to reach peak strength. Does subutex kick in and reach peak effect faster than this?

When using suboxone to get high everyday, very little tolerance builds up, you can get high using the same dose everyday for months and months without needing to up the dose. Does Subutex work like this too? Or does tolerance build up quickly in comparison to what I've described?


Please let me know the general background facts of your encounters with Subutex please; ROAs, dosages, duration of use, purpose of use, prior tolerances, etc.",1551063906.0

If I don't use it, I won't be able to work. I won't be able to be friendly with customers. I'll be in constant pain, and I'll lose my job. But I have some things going on in my life right now and I really need to get high at night and to just not think about this shit for awhile. If I think about it I want to kill myself. However the bupe has fucked up my receptors so bad that even if I skip a day or two of bupe(only when I'm off from work) and try taking pain pills I still don't get that high. Is there something I can do to reduce to greatly reduce the half life of buprenorphine or knock it off the receptors once I get home? 
I've been doing everything I can to get my mind off this shit. I lost over 1000 dollars gambling this weekend because gambling is the only high that doesn't interact with bupe. Oh, and I do a ton of xanax at night but that still doesn't help enough. My only other option at this point is to get off bupe and just use all day with small doses at work and large doses at night, but it's really hard considering I work in a pharmacy and they will notice if I'm high on opiates more easily than a normal job would.

Btw I have weened to a very low dose of buprenorphine 300-450 mcg of belbuca so no naloxone. And it still fucks up my receptors..

I just need some guidance ya'll, I'm really suffering.

Don't suggest therapy, please. I've done it my whole life and it never helped me. I just need to get high until I get past this hurdle. I've been in this spot before, and got past the hurdle, and I stopped getting high and lived an amazing life on bupe. But last time, during the hurdle, I didn't have bupe monopolizing my damn receptors.

I pull the needle out, wipe off my arm pull down my sleeve and go answer the door. He is in full uniform because he just got done work. Good thing we are really cool and he's a cool cop. He's a younger dude that just moved in a few months ago. I've been in my house 15 years so I'm kind of the boss here in our little court.

He said when he's home he don't care what I do...then he says that he likes to party too and if they ever get too loud to just let him know.

Well, anyway he just had some stuff to ask me about and we chatted for 10 minutes or so. The whole time I kept thinking that I have 40cc of some of the best ECP sitting upstairs on my desk and that needle will be in deep before he even walks through his door. I should have asked if he wanted to come in an partake. Don't laugh...the first time I ever did heroin I got it from my best friend, who was a narcotics detective.

The dope I’ve been shooting tests positive for fent but clearly I have know idea how much or what kind. Now when I dose I just high for about 10 min of that rush then I come down and basically am just relaxed. Sometimes on the comedown I’ll nod out but all in all the high lasts like an hour. I can talk to my parents 30 min after shooting and they wouldn’t know a damn thing, and my mom knows how to spot me being high bc I used oxy for years! So maybe it’s the fent and I just need better dope, but this is also the best dope around all the others don’t even dissolve fully without heating up and their highs suck or are straight up sedating. This one is a nice high and relaxing after the rush. Is this the norm? Or could I expect more from straight heroin off the DNMs? Thanks guys! 


Edit: the dope doesn’t completely disappear after 30 min but it’s a very small high just relaxed feeling for a few hours maybe some nods but no euphoria or nothing just like I’m tired. ",1551036195.0

I have 

28 2 mg sub strips.

About .412 g of ecp that I’m pretty sure has some fent in it.

.8 g or so I think of bth, not fent cut, that’s probably why it seems weak to me or maybe I just haven’t been smoking enough of it.

And a pretty large tolerance I believe. I can sniff .25 g or about a bundle of ecp and just feel a tiny bit nice. Hard to get a real rush or any substantial high from sniffing anymore.

So what should I do guys, what would you do?

It’s been 10 hours and 15 min since my last dose and I feel okay.

I’ve been waiting longer and longer periods in between dosing and somehow my body has gotten accustomed to it and I don’t start to feel seriously sick until at least like 24 hours in maybe more, I hope that’s not because of fent or fent analogues/metabolites. I start feeling anxious and not great at about 16 hours but it’s definitely tolerable up to at least 20-24 hours.

Should I wait until around 20-24 hours or longer however long I can wait and take subs? At what dose, 1 mg? And if it causes precipitated wd take dope? And then try and take 2 mg of subs the next day and try and take more dope if I feel too sick or just chill on the subs if it’s bearable?

Should I try and get high with .25 of ecp and .25 of bth and save the last .16 of ecp and .55 of bth for wd symptoms when I try to switch to subs tomorrow?

Should I uber to cvs get some insulin needles and bang that shit? That actually seems really appealing rn. It would double what I have left but I absolutely suck at hitting veins and I’ve never IV’d street dope with unknown fentalogues and cuts in it and I wouldn’t want to IV black tar either that stuff cooks up gross looking but I’m not feeling like I have many other options.

From my personal and newly pc point of view, this is how I have learned to deal with it.

General rules:

1. No video games.

2. Go outside.

3. Get a cool haircut.

4. Be a nice person.

&#x200B;

To not be bored, I must have fun. Here are categories of fun.

1. Sports – takes practice.

2. Music – as in learning to play. Buy a guitar or a harmonica. Takes practice. Best done in public places so you can overcome your fear.

3. Opposite sex – takes practice. You need to learn to talk to them. They are not that scary. Helps if you are not a selfish jerk.

4. General socialization – people have amazing and cool stories. Look them in the eyes and smile – takes practice. They are not that scary.  My dog is worse. Much worse, and he can't even really talk.

You may have noticed the recurring theme of takes practice. There are some people that are natural extroverts and are talented like that, but lots of addicts are loners. Not always natural to interact. Force yourself.

I know there are people with some pretty severe mental health issues and it is not so easy for them.

It dissolves in water fine. But if you dissolve a good sized piece (which you want to to get a good hit) the water seems to thicken up a little bit. So when you try to suck it up the plunger, it will only fill up to about 10 mg and the rest won’t go up. It is so frustrating. Sometimes you can get a little more in taking it in and out 10 times and trying over and over again. 

But you still end up wasting a good amount. I’ve had tar like this before and I’m not sure if it’s the heroin itself or what it’s cut with.

I sat up and collected myself, feeling a not dazed and out of it still, and I exited the car to vomit. I continued nodding for another hour or two. Was this an overdose, or just about as close as one can get without actually ODing? Does an OD necessitate a third-party intervention with narcan or medical treatment? It seems like one wouldnt just wake up on his or her own, but the similar experiences that I've had, where i passed out immediately after using, didn't feel quite so serious",1551006544.0

One specific question I have regards contacting the vendor you plan on ordering with. Is it common to contact them before placing an order? And when you do place the order, do you attach your encrypted info directly with the order, or send it with a separate message?
Any other info that would help a noob out would be greatly appreciated, just trying to be on the ball when I make my first order.

Trying to switch back to suboxone after being on heroin for the last 2 days, did my last hit around 2.5 hrs ago, now this never crossed my mind until now but just realized that tramadol can be used safely/mixed, with either of these at the right dose....

Now normally I know when transitioning/switching from a full agonist(h/oxy) to suboxone/buprenorphine typically you need to wait to be in at LEAST early stages of withdrawal to not go into PWD (Precipipitated WD Syndrome) in order to take your first dose of suboxone


I know that tramadol which is a partial opioid agonist can be used safely/mixed with Suboxone as long as doses are controlled and that suboxone is also a partial agonist opioid, So I was wondering:

**Is it possible, to use tramadol for withdrawals from heroin/oxy etc you get while your waiting to get back on suboxone without PWD??**


Like could I just take a large dose of tramadol as soon as withdrawal from H kicks in (which is around 8 hrs post dose) and just wait maybe another 8-12 or until the tramadol stops help alleviating WD to take the Suboxone? 


Sorry if this sounds like a noob question, just curious if this will work? Have any of you tried it? 

I feel like this might actually be safe to do without the fear of PWD since they are both partial opioid agonists, as long as you wait long enough, if so any details or idea?

Thanks so much

I was in a bad car accident. I wasnt told where my car was for a couple days and when I finally was told & went to see it, I realised they hadnt done ANYTHING to protect it. it was out and open in a parking lot. no cameras. the door was open, car unlocked and since everything was smashed in accident, it literally was wide open. my things were taken, one of which being my script. I called the pharmacy, my dr & the police and was told I was SOL. my dr dropped me since the contract says “lost or stolen meds are grounds for termination” stupid, I know. 

I have been using my tiny emergency supply (literally 3 days worth) to taper over the past 3 weeks so I dont go thru full wd. but the pain is just unbearable. I was hospitalized a few days ago for something serious and I not only have no dr, but no meds. 

I cant get into any office for another 2-3 weeks. I was able to get an appt w a registered nurse who said 1.) since he was my last doctor, he should write a final script until I can establish care w a new dr 2.) he needs to write a letter / note saying it is my final script and he wont be prescribing anymore / wont be my dr anymore. 

he is essentially cockblocking me from finding a new dr. its also making me start the relationship w my future dr horribly since im going in, in pain & desperate for relief rather than being rational and explaining my situation. 

I am gonna call and explain this to him. I think I am gonna ask for a final script since its the due date and no longer would be considered extra / early. I need to be able to leave my bed and get actual sleep. its so unfair that even people w out the chronic pain I have, would have something given to them, but bc they think I have him, I was given nothing for home.

I know this is a dumb question but I am just very curious since, sometimes I choose to smoke roxies rather than snort because I enjoy a slightly different high and feel like it's lighter on the stomach. ",1550965644.0

I told him I would help him when the day arrived. 

He blew me up the day before and on the day of the ride making sure I could help - he was panicking and sweating that I wouldn't come through.

So I take him where he has to go, I'm in WD and hating every second of the ride but fuck it - relief is within sight. We get there, he picks up 100 perc 10's and throws me 3 of them. 

The last time we did this same trip he threw me 7 AND paid for gas.This trip I paid for gas.

I was like ""Whoa, hoss. You need to keep going there. Last time we did this for 7."" Then he wanted to get all puffed up and be like ""Yo dawg (I'm embellishing a bit for comedic effect ;) you're asking me for seventy **fucking** dollars, yo! Dat shit ain't gonna happen!""

I reminded him that I'm bringing gas *AND* the ride that he didn't fucking have before we left and that he could step the fuck out of the car if he wanted to change the deal. 

So we sat in the parking lot of a grocery store for 10 mins arguing about this shit until he threw me one more. I told him not to call me next time.

About 15 mins into the ride he's counting his pills and spills them right down into the electronic seat slide rails and into the housed mechanism that works the seat. Something like 80 pills **everywhere**.

For the next 30 mins we sat a gas station trying to get them out from under the seat. He was 4 short when we gave up.

Karma's a bitch sometimes.

$1000 bucks says he calls me next month anyway.",1550963194.0
