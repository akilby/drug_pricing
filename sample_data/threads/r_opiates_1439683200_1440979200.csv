First off, after a recent OD as well as a legal scare my GF and I have decided to use only legal and/or non-drug testable opiates/opiods as well as to stop IV use. We have recently been using Tianeptine at a greater frequency and dosage than in the past when we simply used it in the normal 12.5mg doses as a mood booster. I've been keeping it a bit lighter than my gf with doses around 500mg to 1500mg a day and my GF is closer to 2000mg to 2500mg a day. I know that these are very high doses and we have decided to switch to U-47700 after reading about potential hepatotoxicity of Tianeptine. However we still have about 30 or so grams of Tianeptine left over and about a two week wait until the U-47700 gets here and to avoid withdrawal will still be using the rest of the Tianeptine.

That leads me to my questions, can you guys send me the links to any research or studies that link Tianeptine to hepatotoxicity please? Preferably ones that list dosage as well as duration of use. On top of that, anyone with experience with similarly high dosages that can tell me about how Tianeptine affected them physically (such as organ damage etc.) would be very much appreciated. Basically I am looking for as much information about Tianeptine's toxicity as possible. If we find that dosing around 1000mg a day is safer we would try our best to taper to that amount as soon as possible. We just want to practice harm reduction as well as we can.

And before anyone recommends kratom or a fent analog I just want to say we have tried kratom from a bunch of recommended vendors and at doses around 15-20 grams it works great for withdrawals but we get no buzz from it. And even though we have both used H, oxy, and oxymorphone for over five years the few times that we have used regular fent we saw just how dangerous it is. We don't want to mess with fent analogs because of how easy it can be to OD on as well as their legal grey area.

Apparently, he was first told it was opium and didn't make the connection to heroin. It wasn't until he texted me about it and with a picture I told him it was dope. He was always the type of person to say he'd never do heroin but he liked oxy a lot. Of fucking course, isn't that what they always say?

I don't have much of a history with addiction myself, but I have serious depression and borderline personality disorder. At my psychological core, I am definitely not the person to try and use heroin recreationally. I've only used it 3 times and I have very little desire to in the future. I know what can happen. It's not worth it. I have known a lot of addicts, while my friend has pretty much never been around one except his new connects or whatever. So he doesn't know the damage it can do and how almost everyone started with oxy's and/or snorting. I have been telling him things like you cannot use it regularly. Saying every week, every weekend, every couple of days, every month is a no go. I told him you sure as hell cannot use it a bunch of times in a row. What do you know? He's been through withdrawals twice so far. He said he would stop(again doesn't everyone) and has been using for the past couple of days. Keeps feeding me I can stop anytime I want blah blah. I'm sorry but again I'm just at a loss. I feel like I encouraged him and I feel helpless because I cannot help him. I have been telling him that he has a problem and it only gets worse from here. Just because his withdrawals weren't god awful doesnt mean anything. THey're just going to get worse. And the truth is I can't because its up to him.

I'm a new doctor who recently started working in an area with a large population of opiate users. I'm rotating through the emergency room and the trauma surgery service, where a lot of my patients are opioid addicts who also have injuries that can cause them real pain. Obviously the painkillers I would usually prescribe to an opioid-naive person will not work for an addict with a high tolerance. I'm having conflicted emotions between trying to treat an addict's pain as best I can and not wanting to hurt their addiction (or have them potentially OD) by giving them more than what they need. 

I've had a patient who's pain was being controlled with a lot of IV, PO, and transdermal meds AND an epidural catheter who snuck out of the hospital to inject heroin through the IVs I placed in him. This patient definitely didn't need that heroin for his pain. He was then surprised when I wouldn't give him a script for a boat load of OxyContin.

I guess what I'm asking is how can I avoid getting taken advantage of? I want to help all my patients, addicts included, but I know that the truly addicted will get whatever they can from me and abuse my ability to write then scripts. What signs should I be looking for to avoid overprescribing someone who is going to abuse my scripts? And have any of you actually been helped by a doctor?",1439657075.0

 ""Let's take him to the clinic.  He's fucked up.  Can you walk?""

 ""Yes..?""

 I stand up and fall.  Arms help me back up.  

 ""Maybe call an ambulance?  Shit!  There's no phone.  Someone ripped it out of the wall.""

 ""No hospital!"" I beg.  ""I need a shot...""

 ""Dude I don't have anything.""

 Now I am alive.  In my anger I see Melo clearly.  Liar.  Demon.  Give me some fucking smack!

 ""Please...Melo?"" I beg him.  

 Dev steps over and caresses my face.  I jerk back.  Don't touch me.

 ""Jackie at the clinic can help"" smiles Dev.  ""You NEED help Vagabond!""

 She tries to hug me but I push her away.  These fuckers holding out on me?!  They are trying to kill me.  I know.  Ok, I'll let them lead me for awhile and then run.  I think I have some books in my closet.  I'll sell them.  Should be enough for today.  The Mexicans by the soccer field in the park sell $15 bags.  That is two normal shots.  Or one fat shot.  But what if I can't make it back here?  What if they steal everything while I'm gone?

 ""Wait a second.""  

 I open the box.  The heroin is gone.  I swallow the leftover pills, gather the half burned cigarettes into my pocket with the lighter that still works.  Then I pick up the picture.  When Dev and Melo see who it is, they both look away.  I zip the photograph into the innermost pocket of my jacket where I usually hide my dope.  Where I store my treasure.

 Melo leads me out of my room.  I walk through a stranger's house.  It reeks of piss and shit and death.  I recognize the couch but nothing else.  Piles of garbage, holes in the walls and spray paint.  The refrigerator hangs open like a yawning mouth, the light extinguished.  No food is needed in a place where people wait to die.  Dev tells me Melo will come back for my things but I don't care.  Everything is already lost.  This is the end.

 They lead me out into the street and as the first waves of withdrawal stagger me.  I'll get more I promise myself.  It will be alright.  I just gotta slip these fools and I'll get more.  Enough for today...

 ~^~^~^~^~^~^~

 This story began in a cave.  The Roman general that burned the Libri Sibyllini beneath the Temple of Jupiter 1,500 years ago was wrong.  There is more than one volume because these mad birds still sing.  Sibyls are everywhere.  Screaming from street corners, raving in bars, chained in hospitals and living in city parks.  

 And there are many, many caves in the souls of the lost.    

 Yes it is true chemicals ate into my brain.  Frenzied ants feasting upon sugar but I can still see it so clearly in my mind...Was my life nothing but a moth's dream?    

 This was before they had to restrain me.  This was before the sun melted the wax from my false wings.  This was before I was re-trained by state issued medical professionals to be normal.  

 But even handcuffed to the bed I fell so far.

 ~^~^~^~^~^~^~

 My friends are gone.  Strangers camp here.  They used to give me money or drugs.  Mostly drugs.  Not sure who is in charge but I hear animals fighting.  Screams.  There is no more electricity or cable TV.  The blue, fairy glow of ice burning in crack pipes is the only light in the Darkness.  The last time I walked through my living room, no one looked at me.  Strangers.

 A box that once contained high heels for a beautiful woman now holds my life.  Heroin.  Also some pills, scraps of LSD, a metal measuring spoon, lighters and a blood stained shoelace wrapped around two used needles.  I cook while I still have daylight.  Cooking shots is the only time my hands are steady.  

 At the bottom of the box, beneath it all, is a photograph.  I leave her face down.  I don't need to look at her.  This picture is burned into my eyes.

 And if I close them...

 She reclines casually on a couch smoking a cigarette. It was taken during one of her blond phases.  She looks up at the camera likes she knows I will be staring at this picture for one thousand years.  Her eyes reach out and catch my soul.  The drowning blue stare.  

 ~^~^~^~^~^~^~

 The mountain is cool in the summer.  The path leading up to the rock face is lush with ferns, vines and flowers.  The air here is floral scented and the breeze from the sea is fresh and clear.  A giant crack in the rock face rises up like a frozen scream.  The god's mouth.  

 I enter the god.

 Inside is starlight.  Phosphorus blues and interstellar greens softly illuminate the interior.  Stalactites drip continuously as I travel down a slick, muddy trail.  Down the path is a forgotten shrine carved into the wall of the cave.  Someone has lit the altar fire and it crackles hypnotically as I approach.  One of the columns has collapsed, knocking over a pair of statues that once embraced each other.  Their youthful bodies are eerily beautiful in the flickering firelight.  Her full breasts are exposed as her robes slips forward revealing rounded hips.  His torso is sculpted with taunt muscles stretched in motion and life as he reaches for her...but their heads are missing.  I step over the ruins to inspect the shrine.  Blood offerings have been placed in the votive flames for over 2,000 years.  The priests that tended this place are gone.  Their civilization has fallen.  

 But many still worship this god.  

 Behind the altar, carved into the wall is a message.  I trace my stained fingers across the words: 'Heaven is the embrace of the flower god.  But in his sweet mercy is death.'  

 Once again, the god gifts me the soft peace.  Flowers blossom in the Darkness.

 ~^~^~^~^~^~^~

 ""Oh no...It doesn't even look like a vein anymore!  It looks like a long, dried up spaghetti worm.  Oh my poor sweet Vagabond.  Are you in there?  Melo help me get him up-""

 ""Hold on.  Those fucking tweakers are still out there- HEY!  GET THE FUCK OUTTA HERE!  THIS ISN'T A SQUAT!  GO!""

 I can hear them.  Old friends.  The best friends.  Yelling into the mouth of the god.  Sounds from the real world dancing across the void.  

 Someone still cares?  About me?  I vow to take more LSD so I can stay awake in their world.  Or is it my world?  I have forgotten...But I don't want them to come inside my cave.  No one should enter the god's scream.  

 For in my cave there is only slavery, madness and death.

 ~^~^~^~^~^~^~

 Fiber optic cables and copper wiring suspend the office chair from hundreds of feet.  But even in the lowest part of my cave there is a single ray of sunshine.  It stabs the Darkness and illuminates the chair and the Sibyl.  

 ""See the Light?  There is always Pandora's gift"" sings the demented thing in the chair.  

 A tiny doll woman dressed in a rotting, Nike tracksuit.  Bare feet with black, curled toenails.  

 ""Dev?""

 ""Nobody that loves you is down here"" the Sibyl laughs. ""Down here is just your broken hallway mirror.  The dragon that eats itself!""

 The chair moves in a circle above me, creaking.  And she sings.  A horrible noise.  Truth pours from her mouth and blood weeps from her eyes.  A fountain of insanity.  I see it all.  She tells me how it will end.  

 A trail of broken smiles.  Women crying alone in the dark.

 ~^~^~^~^~^~^~

 When the sun melts the wax, I plummet into her eyes.  The deep blue of her oceans.  The plunge was sudden but soothing.  I want to keep sinking into her Darkness...


~^~^~^~^~^~^~

 ""Wears off quickly now doesn't it?  Legs jolting in agony, thrashing in your bed...Snot streaming from your nose while you shit your fucking guts out screaming and INSANE!"" screeches the thing in the office chair.

 I cover my ears and pray for my god to soothe the madness.  But she is right.  My shot is already wearing off.

 ""You will fall back to your wretched life!  IF YOU'RE LUCKY.""    

 The Sibyl leers at me, her face blurring like a deck of shuffling cards.  Shuffling faces of women I know.  The faces flip past but She keeps coming up.  Her eyes...    

 ""Succumb to Heaven!  Kiss me with blue lips!  Hold me with cold arms!  No longer cry about Earthly possessions or love.  Soon the moths will come and cover your eyes!  From sniffing to smoking.  From smoking to shooting.  What is left?  Oh you know what is left...One last high my love!""

 My ears are covered but the Sibyl's cackling laughter echoes inside my skull.  There is a vacuum WHOOSH! and I fall.  The beam of sunlight vanishes.  The altar fires are cold.  The smothering blackness crushes me as I feel moths brushing against my face.  

 ""The skeleton in the corner cradles your clock babe"" whispers Kym's voice from the Darkness.

 I scream and scream and scream.

 ~^~^~^~^~^~^~

 The god speaks.  ""I can make it all go away.  Heaven.  You know the my price.""  

 And the love of a god is a powerful thing.  I writhe around in a sickly moist spot trying to find myself.  I think I pissed the futon.  Or maybe it's sweat.  The room is dark but I find the box, take the shoelace and tie off.  I slap my arm feverishly.  Rise goddamn you!  Show me the road to my heart.  Just one more time!  

 ~^~^~^~^~^~^~

 ""Mrs. Severson?  Hello, my name is Devika Liora!  I'm a friend of your son.  Hi.  Well you need to pick him up.  He's very ill"" says Dev into the pay phone.  ""What?  We tried to take him to the clinic but he refused.  He gave me this number.""

 When you wake up on the sidewalk, you know you fucked up.  You might not remember when or where...but you definitely fucked up.  My cheek presses against the concrete.  It's still warm from the morning sun.  I can smell piss and bleach here.  Garbage obscures my view but I hear people walking by.  I doubt they would spare me a look.  City people walk with purpose.  Eyes forward and never acknowledging the lost.

 They just keep walking.

 ""We should call an ambulance"" mutters Melo.

 ""No hospital!"" I groan.  

 I feel very strongly about this.  Once I go in...

 ""Ok.  We are at Valenc-"" says Dev but she stops and throws her hands up in despair.  ""She needs a pen!  Melo, give him some of that valium.""

 ""Really?""

 ""Yes Mr. Melo!  With his habit he will be hurting so just-oops.  Wait a second"" says Dev going back to the phone.  ""Yes!  Hi!  Ok, do you have a pen ready?""

 I try to get up. The effort makes my world smear and tumble.  I feel like I'm falling.  The dizziness of daylight tumbles down, crushing, squeezing...and I puke.

 ""Eww gross"" squeaks Dev.  ""What?  No Mrs. Severson.  He's fucked up, I mean excuse me, he's sick.  I don't know!  Drugs or something?  Can you get him please?  The 600 block of Valencia.  Near the used clothing place.  How long?  Ok.  We'll wait.  Please hurry.  Ok.  Goodbye.""

 ""I'm sick"" I announce uselessly.  

 No one says anything.  I curl into a protective ball on the sidewalk.  Looking up, I can see a pink sign.

 SAVE NOW!

 ""Yes please.""

 Darkness.

 ~^~^~^~^~^~^~

 Dev fed me some valium and shared a cigarette with me while we waited.  Sharing a cigarette with her reminded me of Kym.  The three us always shared smokes.  She held my hand the whole time and promised me everything would be all right.  My mom pulled up.  Too weak to stand, Melo helped me into the car.  Bless Devika.  And though I never saw her again, it was not the last kindness she gifted me.  

Dreams are funny things.  

 I'm 23,  lost the love of my life, flunked out of school, smell like piss and am nothing but a sick, demented junkie.  My mom is talking.  I blur in and out of reality and comprehend only fragments.

 ""...a junkie!...knew this would...like your father!  Great staff...hospital...""

 ""NO!"" I yell.  ""No hospital!""

 ""Honey!  You're so sick!  The doctors will make you...""

 And I give up.  No more reasons to do anything but wait and see what happens next.  It can't be any worse.  Right?  I try and take out her picture but my hands are shaking too much to work zippers.  

 I am dying.  Someone cries.  Me?  My mom?  Both?

 Then it happens.  The mercy.  Maybe I ate LSD when I swallowed pills...Maybe the car stereo is on.  Maybe my brain stuck in the Maui loop.  

 That song she used to listen to to get ready to go out...'Dreaming' by Blondie.  And I can see her dancing.  The song poured into her soul and radiated from her body like an exploding sun.   At a club, all dressed up and her rhythm is pure gravity.  A celestial body in motion creating the Universe.  Everyone watches her dance for she is beautiful, erotic and connects them to the energy that shapes the tide and moves the planet.  But I was luckier.  I not only saw but I also tasted.  I smelled the heat rise off of flesh as she danced only for me.  Dancing wild and free.  Wearing only her Egyptian eyeliner highlighting that drowning blue stare...

 My falling star.  My wish that slipped away.  Power, magic and unearthly beauty.  You bind me to reality for I remember you walking down the street.  Your hand in mine.  You are real.  Proof how lovely it is without the god.  

There is no god.",1439800101.0

The pain doctor in the meantime (This week) gave me Tylenol 3 to take until the upcoming Saturday (the 22nd), when I would have gotten a new script. I called the doctor with increased pain.

I'm wondering if they are going to cut me off (I take hydrocodone 5 acetaminophen 325) after my script for Tylenol 3 runs out, or the likelihood that my pain doctor will fill a new script for the hydrocodone. I'm just asking, and getting anxious, because it helps more than anything else has.

**In the Poppy Field**
 
   The naive couple, peacefully sitting by the roaring flames of the fire, are waiting for something to change. Tybalt glances down on the smooth skin of his milkwhite legs.
  
“I enjoy it here.”
  
Fiona gives him a heartwarming smile as she looks at Tybalt’s grim young face.
  
 “I love you Tybalt. It’s just that I feel like there is more to the world than staying in this cave everyday.” 
  
Tybalt knows that she is the only one who truly loves him, besides his mother. No one can compete with his mother.
  
“The world is dangerous,” he comments, “Plus, what’s wrong with doing the thing that makes us happy?”
  
He is staring, mesmerized, at the bubbling black liquid in his spoon.
  
“Hey, get that off the fire! You’re going to burn it,” Fiona snarls.
  
Tybalt snaps back into reality and places the spoon on his lap.
  
The one thing Fiona doesn’t put up with is wasting their cure. She may seem innocent and submissive, but extracting the milk of Mother Poppy is their only source of income and livelihood. It is their anchor and ultimate cure. They are fortunate to know how to do it.
  
“Don’t worry, Brutus is dropping off more pods soon so we will still have plenty.”
  
Fiona looks down with her droopy sunken eyes. Tybalt can tell that something is bothering her. He knows what it is.
  
“Do you want a fix?” Tybalt politely asks.
  
Her eyes light up like lightning, and she hastily snatches the spoon and soaks up the gooey goodness with her syringe. Tybalt is getting agitated, but he acts like it’s okay.
  
“Babe, can I just have a little of it? I’m running low” Tybalt asks.
  
Fiona grudgingly agrees. She digs up a used needle in her crumby pocket and fixes her shot. She finds a vein, but she can’t keep her handles still from the excitement of what will come. After digging for a vein for the 5th time and finally pushing the trigger, it was Tybalt’s turn. His eyes are fixated on the syringe. There is a little left in the syringe which he will fully use. He slowly puts the spike into his vein, and the rush begins.
   
They stare at eachother until they drift into a realm of apathetic bliss as a warm caring blanket covers their souls. Their dark cavern lightens up as they fall into a deep tranquil sleep.
  
As the sun floats up, the warm embrace of the poppy has subsided. They do not feel the sun’s warmth as well.
  
“Get up Tybalt!”
  
Tybalt hears Fiona’s screams.
  
“Wake up, please!”
  
Normally, he is the one who has to wake her up. He instinctively knows that something has gone terribly wrong. He jumps up frantically looking for his beloved, and he sees a large scruffy man walking towards Fiona with an awful smile on his face.
  
“Help me!”
  
Tybalt freezes as he sees Fiona pick up a rock. Fiona tries to smash the rock onto the man’s face, but it is no use. The man jerks his arm back and knocks her out in one solid punch. After seeing her limp body, he drags her away from the cave.
  
The world fades as Tybalt faints.
  
He wakes up feeling a stream of anxiety burning a hole in his chest. He suddenly looks around and sees no sign of Fiona.
  
“Was this a dream? Was this a dream?” he timidly asks himself while vigorously clenching his jaws.
  
He knows the answer. A sense of dread washes over him. He dashes out of his bygone home, and continues to sprint. Trees and bushes whiz by him with no sign of life to be seen. He lives in a confusing world.
  
“Fiona!” he screams, “Where are you?”
  
The sun beams down at him and naturally he knows that he made it to Brutus’s massive poppy field. Plump green poppy pods of temptation surround him, and he unwillingly feels a sign of relief.
  
“It was Brutus...” he dreadfully realizes.
  
Tybalt calmly walks to Brutus’s shack, but he is nowhere to be seen. He glances down at a rusty metal table and notices a large black rock sitting on it. He sees no hope. 
  
He grabs the dope, carefully cooks it and puts it on his syringe, and injects it into his overused vein in the crooks of his scarred arm.
  
After the thick shot is, he instantly feels well. Warmth begins to spread from his spine to his toes. From his heart to his head, he believes that it is worth it. He knows that he will have a happy ending.
  
“I love you.”
  
He nods out heavily, seeing flashes of Fiona in her pale blue nightgown. She leans over to his face and gives him a kiss.
    
   
Fiona softly whispers to him in a delirious haze, “I need you.”

I was in love immediately. all I remember thinking was, ""why did I ever busy my ass looking for weed when something better was in the medicine cabinet all along?"" a few weeks of semi-regular use later, I'm swiping expired little 10-15mg percs and vics from the cabinet, taking and trading them for those beautiful blue roxys. flash forward 2 months later, I'm railing roxys every night and dabbling in speed and cocaine. I felt unstoppable. pop 2 or 3 trams every morning to keep me well during the day at work, and get trashed every night. it was around this time I had my first OD- 300mg of trams, 15mg of hydro, 60mg of my baby blue roxys, and a few beers was enough for me to have a word with the lord. it didn't faze me. I was bumping the very next night. about 3 weeks later, I was slamming dillys. ""no way I'd ever let the needle touch my veins"", I always thought. not when you got your belt wrapped around your arm and your buddy spotting you whistling dixie. I'm in the deep south, the heroin scene is unheard of. even methheads look down on junkies here. so dillys were the closest thing for me. the ""crack of opiates"". I had just turned 18, had a friend of a friend buy me a clean rig, and it was all over with. I'd slam $50 a night, easy. didn't even know the dosage. well, this past Saturday, my folks came and picked me up from work, no warning. someone called them and told them what I was doing. they knew everything. so they brought me home and had an intervention. flushed all my shit, disposed of the needle. they're keeping me home this week to let me detox. it's been 2 days clean and I hate it. I hate every fucking second of it. I spend most my time on reddit and have lurked here for about a half a year. seeing y'all's pickups and dope porn and all that just makes things worse for me. so, this is adios. thank you all for the knowledge, the advice, and the warnings. thank you for introducing me to this wonderful walk of life.

3hg68m,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3hg68m/oxycodone_duration/,15,https://redd.it/3hg68m,enohpromordyh,oxycodone duration,"hey, i quit taking painkillers in early july and i lasted until about ten days ago or so. i started doing hydromorphone again at about 24mg a day. obviously not enough to make me feel physically sick, but enough to have little sweats and not be able to sleep if i go like a day without taking any.

well, yesterday i found a couple of the old original oxycontin 80mg pills that i had probably lost three or four years ago. i always disliked oxycontin but i decided to try it since i didn't have hydromorphone with me at the time. 

for those of you that have used both of these, do you see any difference in the duration of the oxycodone? it seems to be much much shorter for some reason. to the point where literally two hours later i start to want to do more. with the hydromorphone, i can snort 12mg at like noon, 12mg at like 8-10PM, and sleep until 8-9AM the next day waking up barely feeling a sweat.

i found the oxycontins at 5PM yesterday, so i snorted half of one right there. i thought i would be good to go to sleep at 10PM and be okay until like 4-5AM, but i couldn't sleep. i did another 40mg at 11PM, started to feel my eyes closing a bit, but i still didn't fall asleep until 2AM. then i woke up at 7AM with the shitty feeling of semi-sickness, so i quickly did another 40mg. it's now 10AM and it's already completely gone.

what the fuck is it with this drug? i looked up the half life, and it says that it's between 3 and 4.5 hours compared to the 2-3 hours of hydromorphone. so technically it is supposed to last longer. isn't it weird for 120mg to have lasted me only from 5PM to 10AM when usually 24mg of hydromorphone lasted me a full 24 hours up until just yesterday morning?

could this have to do with the fact that the oxycontin pills are old as fuck and have lost their potency? could it be because my body is used to years of hydromorphone and the oxycodone just doesn't feel right and doesn't give that ""relief"" or whatever? i thought about the fact that it could be all in my head, but i really woke up feeling bad after just eight hours. and it's not like eight hours awake where you are moving around and thinking about doing more and shit. i was sleeping.

this is really fucking weird. the conversion shit says that 40mg oxycodone is supposed to be like 15mg of hydromorphone. so it's like taking 45mg hydromorphone and lasting barely 17 hours versus 24mg and lasting 24 hours.

anyone one of you has used both these drugs for a while and can tell me if it's normal that the oxycodone is much shorter acting despite higher doses?",1439907450.0

I recently moved across the country and I don't really know anyone yet, so I'm looking into making poppy tea for myself. The thing is I can't get high off of less than 16mg of dilaudid...so how well does that translate into brewing the tea? 
Have you tried poppy tea? If so, what's it comparable to? How strong does it need to be if I have a decent tolerance? I'm thinking I'll start with 4 or 5 poppy pods....is that enough?

thanks everyone :)

just moved from the US to europe and all I can get is some brownish/dark yellow heroin. its called #3 and is supposed to be base.

you have to dissolve it with citric acid if you want to shoot it. altho I'm not really into IVing.

I want to snort that stuff but it doesnt work really well. I dont get high much from it. should I maybe also dissolve it first and snort dope water up my nose?

Also how are you supposed to smoke this? when I put a small amount on foil (20-30mg) and use a straw to suck it up i got the worst pain in my lungs and over the heart kinda. I think this shit was so hard cut with caffeine, it was disgusting. 

Could I smoke it in my meth pipe? well the lighter will be waaaay below.

Lastly, I wanted to simply plug it. so I got my hands on pure citric acid. put 40mg #h 3 on a spoon, added 10-15mg citric acid and a few drops water. then put the lighter waaaay underneath the spoon and light it up slowly.. Most of the mini rocks/powder dissolved but there was some stuff left that turnt into a *sticked together* mini brown rock. any idea what this might be?

They've stuck by me through hell and deserve so much better. Unfortunately im still a slave but i've been in isolation for 7 weeks now because I keep missing their events....

They invite me out but im seeing double, no way i can drive 1 + hours away....

Anyway tonight I decided these two friends are worth more to me than the heavenly bliss of dope, for them I will do this and for myself. Perhaps my 30 year old butt can afford to move out of her parents place once she drops the habit....

Parents came to me this morning going ""your super depressed, had a seizure from benzo withdrawal last night and your face is badly bruised from it, we wont ask what else your doing but obviously you're not happy here""

So I get to choose between a state with my 2 best friends, a state with 5 or so mates from high school(all guys unfortunately which is hard on a girl) or as they put it 'rehab'.

So move interstate or go to rehab, hell I've only been a daily drug user for 13 years (lol)....but yeah i don't really believe in the places.

Thankfully my 2 friends are forgiving and even though i've let them down recently their giving me a second chance, I think they want me to go to rehab but i can hopefully convince them otherwise. At least make them the promise that if i ever use again ill go.

So yeah today is the day im choosing 13+ year friendships of people i love more than my biological family over dope. Not an easy decision but after that benzo seizure i was ready to die, why the hell not try and make the best of it for now..

Will I ever relapse? probably, but if I can make it 6 months without using then quitting again for another 6 months ill be very proud of myself. 

At the end of the day as much as i love dope its not living its just doing or experiencing, I want to go back to living a life not escaping reality. I'm 4 days sober now and besides the benzo seizure im doing alright, got more of those to ween myself off them too.

My history: after about four years of continuous opiate use, I managed to put together some completely-abstinent clean time (about 2.5 years), then relapsed for a few months on hydrocodone after a surgery, resulting in me getting on Suboxone, which I successfully tapered down to 2 mg/day after about two years. I relapsed again on heroin in March, then went to detox and got back on Subs at the end of May. I picked up again shortly after and have been smoking about 1.2 g of (pretty shitty quality, tbh) bth daily since. I hate myself for using again because I've really been struggling getting back on Subs. My goal is to get stablized on them with the eventual goal of tapering back down/being completely abstinent.

So here I am...I took 2 mg of Suboxone sublingually tonight about 18 hrs after my last use, thinking I was sick enough on the COWS scale, but I freaked, thought I felt sicker about 20 minutes in, and picked up some dope. In hindsight, I don't think it was PWD, but it took like a full .8 g+ just to feel better. Anyway, I have some knowledge of bupe and am under the impression that now that I have some on my receptors, it should be easier for me to induce tomorrow. Is this the case? I'm so fucking over this and miss being clean so badly, but I keep caving because I'm a goddamn wimp when it comes to kicking. I guess my question is, if I wait until I'm in moderate withdrawal tomorrow, the Suboxone should theoretically cover me better because I took some tonight, right? I've heard of some people attempting to ease induction by doing some bupe, then their DOC to bridge the gap, then more bupe the next day when they're sick, then stabilizing on Subs (or using again to bridge the gap, if needed). I feel so dumb for asking such a specific question, but y'all seem super helpful and supportive, and I'm honestly scared shitless of PWD.

I guess I should mention that I also took some Gabapentin and clonidine while waiting today in an attempt to keep from caving and calling up my dude, which helped a lot, but also masked some of my symptoms...should I hold off on the supportive meds tomorrow to get a clearer COWS assessment?

**Hydration**

Your body needs water to survive and stay healthy. While detoxing from opioids you'll likely be suffering from diarrhea, nausea, and profuse sweating, all of which contribute to dehydration. Maintaining good fluid levels is integral to getting and feeling better and should be a priority whenever you are sick including withdrawal. Water, juice, soup, whatever you can take and keep down you should be consuming. Although people say detoxing from opioids isn't inherently deadly (as compared to benzos/booze), it does put a lot of stress on your heart and other organs and dehydration can be dangerous as well.


**Electrolytes**

Along with needing fluids in your body, you need ions in those fluids which are known as electrolytes. They are integral to proper muscle and nerve function (including your heart) and a lack of them will result in cramps, seizures, and other nasty problems. Just as diarrhea, vomiting, and sweating decrease fluid content, they also decrease electrolytes (especially sodium and potassium) and need to be replaced. Sports drinks are an excellent source, but juice and soup will do as well. Hydration is important, but be sure you don't over do it on just water.


**Vitamins and Minerals**

Although some of these fall under the category of electrolytes, vitamins and minerals are important for proper bodily functions. Although they can be obtained naturally from dietary sources, in the midst of opioid withdrawal you might not be feeling too hungry and taking a good multivitamin can help supply your body with everything it needs to get back on track.


**Food**

Your heart pounding, shivering body will surely be craving some energy, and calories in the form of food is where it comes from. That being said, if you are way too sick to eat then there is nothing wrong with sticking to juices and soups until feeling a little better. Getting some fresh fruit in your stomach can do wonders for your mentality though and sometimes help with nausea as well. Ensure shakes are another great way to get some nutrition when solid food isn't treating you right. They are packed with all kinds of vitamins and will supply you with calories that you desperately need.


**Sleep**

It may be hard, but your body and brain needs sleep to heal and repair. There are drugs which can help, but resting and at least trying to sleep is just as important as keeping active and trying to keep your mind off of withdrawal. Diphenhydramine is a good OTC drug that will help with sleep at a dose of about 50mg. If you are having trouble with restless legs try taking black haw or cramp bark. These are both natural antispasmodics which relieve muscle cramping.


**OTC Drugs**

There are many drugs which are often available over the counter that can do wonders for helping alleviate certain symptoms of opioid withdrawal. Some of the more commonly used ones are listed here.

*Loperamide* - First, let me start by saying loperamide is a god send and your best friend when in withdrawal. Loperamide (generic Immodium) is an opioid-receptor agonist and acts on the μ-opioid receptors in the myenteric plexus of the large intestine; by itself it does not affect the central nervous system. Taking loperamide can, and will, alleviate ~75% of the worst withdrawal symptoms. Go and buy the biggest bottle of generic Immodium you can find. Start with a dose of 20mg (10 2mg pills) and see what that does for you. Some people take up to 100mg throughout the day to alleviate their symptoms. I do not advise going much higher than that due to cardiotoxicity at *very* high doses.

*Kava* - Kava is an awesome plant. It helps with sleep and has powerful anxiolytic properties. Take 4-8 250mg pills for moderate effects.

*Polyethylene Glycol 3350 (Miralax)* - Take this in combination with loperamide to help 'level' you out, as the loperamide will plug you up when taking high doses to combat withdrawal. Use 17g once a day while constipated from the loperamide.

*Diphenhydramine* - This is generic Benadryl. It will help you get some sleep. I suggest 50mg. If you over do it you will start to see it's nasty delirient properties. Some people report that DPH makes restless leg worse, so if RLS really bothers you try something else for sleep. Many other common OTC antihistamines also intensify RLS.

*Naproxen sodium* - Use this for muscle aches and pains. Start out with 500mgs and go from there. Once again, don't over do it as this is an NSAID and is rough on your stomach.

*Arnica, Devil's Claw, and Cat's Claw* - They all are herbs that will relieve pain, swelling and stiffness.

*Black Haw and Cramp Bark* - Herbal antispasmotics which relieve muscle and menstrual cramping. 

*Passion Flower (Passiflora incarnata)* - This is a sedative that will give you a very mild buzz too. It is sold in pills but if you can find the liquid, get that. This stuff actually works pretty darn well for the shakes and irritability.

*Phenibut* - Phenibut is a legal GABAergic drug that can help tremendously with sleep and anxiety. It is readily available online. Please note that phenibut can be habit forming with terrible withdrawals of it's own and tolerance builds rapidly to it.

*Valerian Root* - Valerian root helps promote sleep and doesn't cause RLS like many of the antihistamines do.

*Melatonin* - Natural hormone in your body that anticipates the daily onset of darkness. Taking melatonin has show to help regulate the natural circadian rhythm of your body.

*Dextromethorphan* - DXM is a derivative of the powerful opioid levorphanol and some people say it helps with their withdrawals. It also may help potentiate the loperamide. I wouldn't go much above 60mg of DXM as it has strong dissociative properties at higher doses, unless you think the DXM trip would be enjoyable while in full blown withdrawal.  

*Multi Vitamins* - Help replace a lot of vitamins that you may have been lacking due to diarrhea and vomiting. 

**Prescription Non-Opioids**

Only take one of the following, do not mix them. Mixing CNS depressants is dangerous.

*Benzodiazepines* - Benzos help tremendously with sleep and anxiety. Use the bare minimum here. Xanax and Klonopin dose: 0.5mg, Valium: 10mg, Ativan: 0.5-1mg.

*Z-Drugs* - esZopiclone (Lunesta), zolipidem (Ambien), zaleplon (Sonata). These are to knock your ass out. One tablet of one of these drugs at bedtime will help with sleep.

*Soma* - Once again helps with sleep and also helps with muscle cramps and aches. I suggest not taking more than 350mg of Soma.

*Gabapentin (Neurontin) and pregabalin (Lyrica)* - These are very similar drugs that both help with RLS and anxiety to an extent.  400-600mg is an average dose of gabapentin.

*Clonidine* - Lowers blood pressure and limits hot/cold flashes. Only take 0.1mg at a time and no more than 0.4mg a day.

*Ropinirole* - This is an amazing drug that is primarily prescribed to treat Parkinson's Disease but is also prescribed for RLS and it will completely stop RLS. Ask your doctor about it if you can.

*Legal-ish Opioid Substitutes*

If you are just fighting off withdrawals until your next dose check a few of these out*

*Kratom* - Mitragnya speciosa. This is available online and in some headshops. It is a natural opioid agonist that will completely stop withdrawal. 

*Tianeptine* - This is also an opioid agonist that was thought to be an SSRE for a long time, however it is not an SSRE. It will also hold off withdrawal for even the largest habit. It is not a controlled substance in the US but is in many countries. It can be purchased online as well. 

**Tips and other things that help**

*Hot baths with Epsom salt*

*Exercise* 

*Marijuana* 

*Heating pads*

*Eat healthy*

*Fresh sheets on the bed (trust me)*

*Stay away from caffeine*

*Get as much rest as possible*

She could fall asleep so quickly and just like that, at the mere snap of a figure she would wake again with full awareness, only to fall right back asleep. 

I found this subreddit a couple years ago. I was a bored depressed teenager who found a few Vicodin laying around in my father's cabinet where he would occasionally have weed and lsd around. In those Vicodin though I had found what I could only describe as pure unadulterated bliss, from the first dose I was hooked and here I am now, another suburban junkie. 

As I lurked this subteddit more and more though I realized that my parents were well...addicts like you and I. As it turns out I learned my mother's peculiar habit was actually what we call ""nodding"" and my father was an addict too. Last year I went on a shopping trip wth my mother and she picked up a prescription, it turns out she is prescribed 175 30 mg Roxicodone and my father is prescribed 125 15 mg Roxicodone every month. Which is not enough I guess because they always end up couped up in bed for a couple of days before refill day. My sister however has never had a problem with drug abuse.

2 days ago I lost another friend to H. So far the death toll is close to a dozen friends & acquaintances. It's easier for me to deal with all the loss by considering it a local epidemic, and not just a drug overdose. Since Rob's death in 2010 we've been averaging 2 - 3 deaths per year. Rob, being the first and hardest to deal with, was the saddest because he died on his wife's birthday leaving behind 2 beautiful children. Luckily  he was the only one with children. I don't have too many friends left who use, so I'm not sure what the remaining friends' chances are of staying on this planet. It might be selfish but I avoid my ""friends"" at all cost. I call no one, I hangout with no one. I see my wife and that's all. Many people don't understand how or why I do it, but my wife and I are both blessed/cursed with the ability to cut people off without feeling remorse and without regret.

We don't hang out like we use to. I got away from dope for a while, and just started chipping again. He has been at it long and hard for years now, so while I got sober we stopped hanging out. A necessity for me staying sober. We meet up though, shoot the shit, and get the gear. Afterwards he asks if I can drop him off on my way home so he can drop off some bud at this dude's house. No problem.

He goes inside, weighs the bag, does his shot and out he comes. Completely fuckered. He can't keep his eyes open as he stumbles past my car across the street and into a neighbors yard. He doubles back, drops the sack of bud, and collapsed on his face. Haha, bro got too fucked up I'm thinking. Funny, but I got shit to do, so I get out of the car to grav his ass. That is when things became much more serious.  

My friend has rolled on his back, is white as a sheet of paper, lips blue, eyes in the back of his head, and he is struggling to breathe. Oh Fuck. He is dying. I try and prop him up, smack the shit out of him, pour water on his face. No response at all, just a weak pulse and breathing. It's five in the afternoon and we are on the side of the road, and it is clear that I need to call 911. I grab the weed, throw it inside, and try to half ass hid my dope while I'm on the phone with 911.

I wait a few minutes and a police officer arrives. Soon fire fighters and EMTs arrive. The cop asks me some questions which I reply by saying I saw this guy in the road and called 911. Meanwhile the paramedics narcan and revive him. I don't think he saw me, but off they went to the hospital and off the cop sent me.

After quitting the major leagues, i was fine to get loaded on just a 12.but seems lately a 12 don't feel like shit and i hear people are cutting with the cold medicine.

Bow, would the cold medicine make me sick?
 Is there ANY way to tell the difference in the beads? Color... Size... Anything?

From what i understand d they are fairly similar looking, hence why people are using that to cut it with. 

Also there are signs of tampering in terms of the shine being rubbed off the orange caps. However that don't mean shit to me.  All that tells me is someone could just be careless in handling them with sweaty hands which also rubs off the shine.

Does this mean that heroin itself does not have any actual psychoactive effects and that only when it is deacetylated in the brain to 6-MAM, 3-MAM, and morphine that it produces its cascade of effects. Maybe I'm misunderstanding something here?

Edit: Nevermind, after reading more carefully I saw that it's only a prodrug when taken orally as it has no effect until first-pass metabolism converts it into morphine, which is obviously active orally since you can eat morphine pills and get high. 

For the sake of understanding, let's say a person's body lacked the ability to metabolize heroin into morphine when taken orally, would they not get high on it at all, and would only get high if they were to IV or snort it? Does this mean that heroin itself is not active when absorbed into the GI tract and only when gotten right to the brain? ",1440047391.0

The Uncrustables are just plain delicious, but also, the carbs help fill me up, and peanut butter is also high in protein like the eggs.

Bananas I get for the potassium (supposedly helps with RLS), and they're very mellow flavor-wise so they're easy for me to keep down.

I'll start with the best one, might post the worst later.

There's this small family owned pharmacy near where I live and I often dip into it to buy codeine linctus, I usually buy it about once a week and they've never gave me any trouble up until about a month ago,  the guy at the checkout decided to give me a ""talk"" once because I was buying a bottle every week and you're not really supposed to.

He straight up asked if I was an addict, because I bought the linctus so often. I sort of looked up at him and said. ""Well. Guess you caught me."" What happened next kinda surprised me. He tells me he can't legally sell me  me the bottle, but then he says ""listen mate there are other pharmacies around here you could try. I don't condone what you're doing, but at least you're clever enough to buy linctus rather than use co-codamol, paracetamol is a bad way to go. You're an alright lad, but I think you need to get help.""

I said thank you to him, said I'd try not to buy as often in the future, and that was that. I see him on the bus occasionally and we exchange small talk. I didn't expect him to be so understanding. He told me afterwards he expected a different reaction from me and was surprised I was so honest about it, which is why he didn't ban me from entering again and was so polite. I like that guy. Sometimes I still go in now to buy the occasional bottle, he just kinda smiles at me and says ""have fun.""

So yes. I had no idea he would react in that way.

This is my plan: I have all the kratom/gabapentin I could need. And I have enough kpins to take one kpin(1mg) a day to detox. Along with weed.

So my question is, are there any other tips y'all have? I've detoxed a few times before. But it was in rehabs and such.. Thanks guys!",1440164601.0

I'm planning on shooting Dilaudid for the first time and want some advice on the dosage. 
A little history, back when my tolerance was low, I shot 30mg of Morphine. I got the pins and needles and the rush but there was literally no high after the rush. It wasn't very enjoyable. Plugging worked a lot better. That's the only time I've banged anything, and I got a new connect for 8mg Dilaudid and wanna try it out for the one time. 

Anyway, onto the important shit.
I usually plug around 100mg of Oxy or 200mg of Morphine to get nice and high. 
All my friends are saying to go ahead and bang the full 8mg. With my tolerance, I feel like that would be safe, but I want some advice from the pros. Now, I'm only planning on doing this ONE time and wanna get it right. I feel like 4mg might be a little disappointing, but I feel like the full 8 would be just about perfect considering my tolerance. What do you guys think? 4mg or the whole 8. I just don't wanna be disappointed because I'm only doing it once. I wanna get it just right and feel the full effects and have the perfect one time experience. So what would you guys recommend?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",1440151504.0

So just let it struggle on the streets of richmond for a little bit and you've just turned a recovering addict back into a hopeless dope fiend again!


Sorry, I don't post a lot - and I hate these sad, self-depreciating, cry for attention posts more than anyone else (which is why I will regret posting this as soon as I click send), but Im hurting...

I've seen a dozen people die, I've fought off three dudes with a pencil in jail who were trying to take my ass, i've given and endured beatings, i've gone through terrible WDs... I feel like I have seen and been involved in some of the worst parts of humanity, but nothing compares to this feeling.  The feeling of just... ""Fuck it"".

I thought I would feel a sense of freedom when I decided to give in, to give up.  There is no relief.  There's just the aching knowledge that no matter how I get rid of this feeling - whether with a needle or a bullet, it will only cause more problems for the people (person) Im leaving behind who may find it in themselves to care years from now.

Regardless - I can see the deep end.  It's calling my name.  I didn't post a lot, but I lurked a lot.  Thanks for the humor, thanks for keeping me entertained while sitting in my car at the 711 waiting on the dopeman, thanks for creating a sense of community among a group of people who so often and so easily lose it.

3htgf6,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3htgf6/summer_blues/,36,https://redd.it/3htgf6,morbo2000,Summer Blues,"""Holy shit dude..."" exhales Jason pounding the table.  ""This!  This is what I need!  Mother...fucker.""

We have been on acid for three nights.  We both have vials of liquid and keep dosing each other for fun.  But we need to come down.  Life is getting strange.  I finally found the answer.  Tar.  With a McDonald's straw and some foil we are testing it out.  And damn...

""Fuckin' like gnomes and unicorns running through the city"" laughs Jason.

He bought some heroin last week but it was not like this.  It not did lift the buildings up higher and higher into the sky before everything tumbled down in slow motion.  Crushed in an underwater grip, we sit at the kitchen as the breeze from the poppy fields flows through us.

""Where?"" asks Jason serenely.

""Rondo.  He said call him later and he'll hook us up with the dude.  Maybe you should go so I can hang out with Mary.""

""Who?"" mocks Jason and then he laughs.  ""Dude your girlfriend has been here for three days and you spent it high with me.  Looking for gnomes!""

I shrug.  It is weird.  I can't believe Mary is going to Europe for the rest of the summer.  We planned to go up to Eagle Lake and relax but this sorority thing came up.  I suppose I am a little upset.  She comes out here and I think we are going to the lake...but she tells me she is off to Italy.  So I hang with Jason.  Looking for gnomes.

""And unicorns"" says Jason reading my mind.  ""I'm gonna go see Rondo.  His band is playing the Strawberry Theater.  Yeah...THIS is what it's supposed to feel like.  Wow.  Dude, we NEED this connect.""

I can barely move but nod dreamily.  Then I hear the door rattling.  Mary.  

""Light a smoke"" I warn Jason.

I watch him try and light it.  He is fucked up.  Shiny, red eyes.  A stupid, happy look smeared across a poorly shaved head.  He looks like an ugly octopus.  He giggles trying to work the lighter.  He accomplishes this just as my girlfriend walks in.

""Oh...Hello Mary.  How are you doing this fine afternoon?"" asks Jason in a normal voice with a normal expression.

I start cracking up as Jason giggles.

""Jesus you guys are stoners!"" admonishes Mary.  ""Man it stinks in here.  Like someone's burning bandaids!""  

Mary is in a great mood.  She even puts up with Jason.  Though mentally, I am barely here, she takes me out, feeds me and talks at me.  We have sex.  Life could be worse.

""Hey where's the mail key?  I need to check if my passport is here.  My dad mailed it two days ago.""

""Hanging by that hallway mirror"" I say.

Mary checks herself out the mirror as she retrieves the key.  Then she walks out.  San Francisco.  The Mission.  Not a bad spot, she thinks walking down the stairs to the mail box.  Her mom told her the Mission was too ethnic but who cares?  Her current big decision is whether or not to leave two days early to catch up with her friends in London...or she could spend the two days with her boyfriend and fly straight to Italy.  Too bad Jason is around.  London is definitely winning, she muses.

Mary walks down the stairs past a tiny homeless girl sitting on the edge of the steps.

""Hello"" says the girl to Mary.  

She is dressed like a gypsy deadhead.  Raggedy skirt, headband and orange sweater three sizes too big.  Mary fake smiles and keeps walking.  She opens the mailbox and Voila!  Passport.  

The girl is still staring.  Crazy?  Drugs?  Oh yeah.  Mary looks at her.  Definitely a vagrant.  The girl stares at Mary with a wicked, impish smile.  Time to go back inside thinks Mary.

""Too bad he's not gonna write much about you"" says the girl.  

Mary ignores this and returns upstairs.  Her boyfriend and his friend have barely moved.  That Jason is such a bad influence, thinks Mary.  I wish he would go away.

""Well I'm outta here"" says Jason standing up and crushing out his cigarette.

I raise my eyebrow.  What about the smack?  I shared...would be nice to get some more.  Jason catches my look.  

""I'll let you know later.  Have fun with your uh, girlfriend dude.""

""Bye Jason"" drones Mary insincerely, ""Oh and I might be leaving sooner than planned so if I miss you...uh yeah.""

""Je m’en fous"" shrugs Jason as he walks off.  

""Ok then!"" says Mary looking at me.  ""What does that mean?  Something rude right?""

I shrug.  

With Jason gone, Mary sits in his chair.  I still see trails off of every movement and stare as waterfall Mary pours into the chair.  Her new GAP clothes are so alien in the city.  She looks like tourist wandering around Pier 39.  Poor Mary.  She lacks style.  She looks so much better naked than she does with clothes on.

""What do you mean if you leave earlier?"" I ask.

""Oh I might have to fly to London.  My mom's making me fly a crazy route to save money.  Hey!  Let's go see a movie tonight?""

Jason jogs down the stairs and looks at his watch.  He has at least 5 minutes til Muni.  All the LSD they have been doing has started messing with his brain.  Things like time or stairs are not only profoundly weird, they baffle him.  Halfway down the stairs, Jason almost screams.  The witch girl is here.  God fucking damnit, thinks Jason wishing his roommate was here to witness this LSD madness.  Only another fucker on LSD for three days could begin to understand.  The creepy witch girl that haunts the park is now sitting on their fucking stairs.  

""Hi!"" says the girl in her weird mechanical doll voice.

""Why?"" asks Jason.  ""WHY are you here?""

""Someday I won't be here"" says the girl hugging herself.  Then she points at Jason's door.  ""I'll be there.  Like a lot!""

After the chill passes, Jason chases away the ghosts by braying like a donkey.  He laughs and laughs.  Then the girl starts laughing too. Jason walks down the road and still laughing, he steps onto the Muni and is spirited away.

""Yeah.  Tomorrow.  Sorry ok?"" she says sincerely.

In Mary's round about way of softening the truth, she finally admits she is off to London.  Tomorrow.  She told me this after we saw the worst movie I have ever seen in my life.  Forrest Gump.  As far as I could tell, we were mocking a retard and fucking with history.  Mary loved it.  We went home and she started packing.  

The phone was ringing.  Mary answered it thinking it was her ride for tomorrow.  One of the advantages of being in a sorority is you can boss around new girls to drive you to the airport.  But it was Jason.

""How ya feeling?""

""I've been better"" I mutter, ""Mary is leaving tomorrow to London.""

""Fuck Mary"" says Jason indignantly, ""I mean the LSD.  It's hitting you again right?  I put enough in your water to dose a cow.""

""What?  You dosed me again?""

""Yeah so what?  I'm fucked up man.  You got me right?""

I think about that.  Oh yeah.  

""Are you chewing gum?""

""Yes.""

""I got you.""

""Dude meet me at the park.  By the fountains.  We need to call a truce brother.  Three days dosing was crazy.  This sneaky fourth day is suicidal.  No more gnomes.  I give up.  NO more ok?  I'm meeting Rondo's connect here.  Come out and let us peace the fuck out.""

""Yeah but my girlfriend is leaving tomorrow.""

""And?  She's leaving dude.  What does it matter?  Actually dose her!  Do it man!""

I do not dose Mary.  

Mary insisted she had to pack and eat pizza in North Beach with her friends.  I am invited.  As she said this the room hummed and gurgled as all the clocks and windows turned to look at me and laugh in a voice like crinkling newspaper...No thanks.  I wander outside.  In my black leather jacket I have a Muni pass.  I show it to the lady and she lets me on.  That motherfucker did dose me.  I sit behind the gnomes.  They are returning from the marketplace to sell their weird wares to the bridge trolls.

Jason meets me at the Muni stop.  I am grateful.  I have a bad habit of getting lost in the park.  Chainlink fences surround madness.  Like log cabins or Japanese temples.  And the squirrels...well, they show you what evil means.  Way worse than the fucking unicorns.

""Alright dude glad you could make it.  Now be honest I can't figure out last night"" says Jason as we walk into the park.  ""My ramen?""

""No.""

""Toothbrush?  Toothpaste?""

""No.  It was the Animal Crackers during X-Files.""

""Hah!  That's when I dosed your taco!""

We wander through the shadows.  The air is growing cooler and city lights sparkle to life far across the dark, grassy fields.

""Rondo said the guy's name is Mellow.  Must be like a rasta-dude"" says Jason.  ""Supposedly over by the fountains...Oh for fuck's sake!""

 I look and see her.  The tiny homeless chick we have been seeing everywhere.  She sits on a bench and smiles at us as if expecting.  I smile back.

""Hi guys!  I was wondering when you would show up"" she says in her weird monotone voice.  

""Maybe she was waiting for you"" I tease Jason as we walk up.

""I don't stick my dick in crazy"" says Jason.

""Eww gross!"" says the girl.  ""And rude!  Bad Thief!""

""Well what the fuck?  You're always around!  I get it!  You're creepy!"" yells Jason exasperated.

""Hey!"" I admonish him.  No need to be mean.  ""Calm down dude.""

""No!  Fuck this!  Fuck you witch girl!"" says Jason pointing at her.  ""This creepy bitch was on our front steps!  Like she followed us!  Now she's here?  Fuck this!""

""You got a problem?"" says a tall man walking down the path and putting himself between the girl and Jason.

""Doesn't concern you!"" growls Jason puffing himself up.  

Too dramatic I think but inside I know things are going off in wrong directions.  The girl senses this too.  She stands up and opens her hands like Easy...  

But Jason pushes it a little too far.  He keeps walking until he is right in front of the guy.  Then he pushes-

One, two maybe three quick punches and Jason is down.  But before gravity can do its job, the man has Jason in a chokehold.  I stare.  Tattooed in bold black across his forearm is 'I am Death.'  

Everything happened faster than Jason could say ""Fuck you!""

""Hey let him go!"" I yell running up to them.  

The man watches me and pivots causing Jason to get lifted up by his neck.  He hold Jason up like a shield.  A shield that is choking.  I stop.

""Melo let him go!"" screams the girl.

The man lets go of his wrist.  The triangle lock he created with his forearm and leverage opens up and Jason drops to the ground sputtering and wheezing.

""Those are the guys I was telling you about"" says the girl.

""Oh"" says the man looking at me, ""Sorry about this.  Hi I'm Melo.  This is my girlfriend Dev.""

^()^()^()^()^()^()^()^()^()

We go to Melo and Dev's tent over by the softball fields.  Jason eventually relaxes though he was surly for awhile.  We each buy a gram of tar.  We tribute them a little and watched Dev shoot up.  It is silent and the only movement is the moths fluttering around the lantern flame.  After all the crazy acid days with little sleep, Jason I both nodd out.  

I wake up once.  Jason and I are shoved together in a corner with a Hollie Hobbie quilt draped over us for warmth.  I can smell whiskey.  Dev is cradling Melo's head and whispering something to him.  Though his eyes are closed, I could see tears streaming down his face.  He reaches up to wipe his face and I see the other arm is also tattooed: I am the Darkness.  

I close my eyes.

Jason wakes me up.  Melo and Dev are holding each other across from us.  Melo snores loudly.  Dev opens her eye and winks at us while we climbed out of the tent.  

I knew she was gone before we went inside.  It was after 9 am and the city was already wide awake.  The workers were working, the joggers were showering and the airport was already flying sorority girls to London.  For some reason I didn't feel bad.  I didn't feel sad.  I felt nothing.  Like nothing just happened.  Mary made my futon before she left.  On my pillow was a note:   

You're an asshole.  I'll send you a postcard.

Using 4 10mg oxycodone/325 APAP...I take about 120mg a day so I figured doing a CWE for one of my doses will lower the tylenol I'm getting throughout the day substantially.

1) Crush 4 pills into fine powder
2) Fill cup with very cold water about 4-6oz (I add ice cubes to help keep the water very cold) 
3) Add powder to the cold water, mix it, let it settle for about 5-10 minutes.
4) Run through filter.

I have about a 1g a day dope habit. I'm thinking no it won't really help as I've taken 30mg of hydro in a situation like this and it didn't do shit but still thought I would ask.

Update: well that was the worst fucking idea ever. I have taken codeine before and nothing like this has ever happened. So I took 300mg, layed down in bed cuz I was already pretty tired and wanted to take a nap. I woke up maybe an hour later, slight buzz, but my whole body itches like nothing I've ever experienced. Itching just made it worse so I hauled ass to Safeway and go benadryl which made it ""ok"" but not better. Lets just say I was miserable for the entire night. Long story shortni think I'm alergic to codeine and never noticed cuz I've never taken such a high dose. What's also strange is when I went to go to bed I was having the worst rls, probably from withdrawls but it was only like 5 or 6 hours after I took the codeine.

So i hit up my boy and we head to Towson to meet his dude theri (this guy is my new middle and he always hooks me up). So we meet his dude and he goes to hand him the cash. 

He comes back happy as shit and pulls out a nice rock of dope, apparently it was 1.3, but idk cause i cant really eyeball dope. So he says be carefull this shits strong bro and im like alright man i will be.

So we head back home and start cutting up some lines and smoking cigs. This shit really was strong as a tiny line had me fucked up. Were just sitting there talking about life addiction girls all that. 

So he drops me off and my day unfolds and im doing lines throughout the rest of the day and feeling great. Around 11 i started feeling really sick though, not dope sick but actually sick from the actually dope. I get some water and lay down and start watching some youtube vids on my phone to calm down. Eventually i kind of nod off to sleep. 

Now here comes the scary part

I woke up around 3 and can barely move my body, like i can move but only in weird jerk movments, like i was a robot or something. I couldnt feel shit AT ALL, and slammed my hand on the ground so many times as hard as i could and nothing. So i was scared i was od'ing or something so i get up to go to the bathroom. Walking was the weirdest shit ever.

I couldnt fully extend my legs or arms i basically had to twist my stiff body side to side to get to the bathroom. I finally get to the bathroom to look at my lips and they werent blue. My breathing was slowed but not that slowed. So at this point im wondering wtf is going on cause i didn't had any OD syptoms. 

I also had a terrible headache and couldnt twist my head for shit, and also pissing was impossible. 

I stated up for a couple more hours just to be safe and when i finnally felt decent i passed out. Im good now but i still have a little headache.

It doesn't help with the aches and general malaise though but a mixture of Tylenol and ibuprofen along with staying well hydrated and an energy drink or two and I'm damn near normal.

3hxenp,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3hxenp/recovery_rant/,4,https://redd.it/3hxenp,RicFlairWOOOOOOO,Recovery Rant,"Hello brothers and sisters, I'm a 29 year old male and recovering drug addict looking for some feedback. For background - I first started taking oxy pills when I was 25. I realized I was way out of my depth after about six months of using so I got on suboxone (mistake), weaned off subs over four months, relapsed almost immediately after, used until my dealer got arrested a couple months later, switched to heroin for six months until finally detoxing and got on vivitrol Summer 2013. FWIW I never IVed, never OD'd, never was arrested and although I have done plenty of heroin I vastly prefer oxy pills. I stayed clean for six months but relapsed in February 2014 and ever since have been stuck in a holding pattern where I'll detox and stay clean for anywhere from 1-3 months, relapse, get clean, etc. I have a pretty good career but since doing opiates my social life and finances have been devastated. I went from having $15,000 in savings, no debt, and great credit to being $40,000 in debt with mediocre credit and no savings within three years. I used to have a decent amount of friends and acquaintances and was always happy with the women I dated but now I barely have any friends and might as well donate my dick to science for all the use I'm getting out of it. Sorry to be crude. Seriously though, more than getting laid I'm just lonely AF. 

Now, I've been in the recovery game for a minute by now. I've been to AA / NA / OpA, had three different sponsors, went through the steps completely with one; I've gone to SMART meetings, used the SMART workbook, read the rational recovery shit, read MANY excellent books on addiction and spirituality, and seen two different therapists specializing in addiction. I rode my bike, banged and clanged at the gym 3-4x a week, started a meditation practice, started going to yoga the days I wasn't at the gym (not all of this at the same time mind you.) A lot of that stuff helps but none of it matters, NOTHING matters, if you don't want to get clean *at least* more than you want to get high and unfortunately the tough thing about staying clean is you can say 'no' 1000x times but all it takes is saying 'yes' once to restart the cycle, and that's what happened to me...several times.


This time is a little different. This time around I have been clean now for ten weeks. I don't feel any sense of accomplishment about it (not that ten weeks clean is some major accomplishment anyways) because I attribute most of it to the vivitrol shots. Sure, I still had to make and keep those appointments, and sure I could have picked up pills or a couple bundles to test or try to override the blocks, but for the most part I'd say I'm clean whether I want to be or not. 

But this time I feel like I'm seeing things more clearly. Or at least I was. I'm not under the illusion that if I suddenly had money and friends and a SO I would no longer have an opiate addiction but I am pretty confident the temptation certainly would be diminished. I know I began using opiates because I was hurt over a bad breakup and then continued to use opiates to dull the (mostly self-imposed) pain of isolation. I've really come to realize that drugs just aren't a solution to any of my problems, and in fact, based solely on my past experience, they only exacerbate or add to my existing problems. I know that life not going the way you want it to is not a valid reason / excuse to do drugs.

But man, my life fuckin sucks right now. I've been out of work for months, which wasn't a big deal at first but after getting turned down for THREE great jobs I interviewed for it's hard to stay positive and expect things will get better soon. This entire summer I've probably gone out five nights and believe me, if it was up to me I'd be going out five nights a week. And by 'going out' I just mean doing something other than isolating in my apartment. I tried to make the most of my time off and stay active but being increasingly poor and having to look for work puts a damper on that. 

So my shot runs out in two weeks. Maybe I'm just having a really terrible day and I'm bitter because it's another friday home alone but I am seriously debating telling my doctor I'm going out of town for a week monday after-next and just copping if my life does not improve in any aspect in the next two weeks until then. And believe me, I will be working to ensure that it does. Now granted, I have yet to display any ability whatsoever in my life to moderate my opiate use...but I feel like I've done pretty much everything a person in recovery could be expected to do, I have tried to be patient and optimistic but nothing other than the things I can control have changed. Some would find that comforting but I find it incredibly frustrating because there aren't many aspects of my life I feel like I can control. I cannot just accept and be at peace with being financially and socially crippled. Opiates won't change any of those things but they will offer at least a very brief respite. 

Is that so unreasonable and / or idiotic?

BTW I posted this under my other account at opiatesrecovery but just didn't get many responses...this sub is so lively I figured I'd give it a shot here. All I ask is that if you aren't at least experienced or interested in recovery from opiates to please keep the comments respectful.

Though I am not schizophrenic just dumped off a methadone program ct at 120. If thats not an irresponsible thing for that place to do i don't know what is. I was a model patient for years, 20,000 dollars easily. Where is america's safety net for the marginalized of society. At least Britain could subsidize the methadone for its patients. I mean come on, it's not like that garbage is expensive. I filled 25 tens for literally 50 cents copay. I mean come on america its time we get our shit together.",1440205246.0

3hwr5n,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3hwr5n/wheres_the_euphoria/,36,https://redd.it/3hwr5n,NahFooll,Where's the euphoria?,"So far my experience with opiates has been:

Eating three 5/325 percocets about an hour apart each.

Using a formerly reputable brand to make poppy seed tea with a half pound of seeds (I tried this multiple times and also rewashed the seeds a few times).

Using an extremely well renowned brand to make a half pound of brew.  (Still no results)

Then I made a pound of brew from the same brand and rewashed the seeds and proceeded to drink the rewash as well.

*I have tried a variety of methods.  I've used cold water and warm water.  I've soaked the seeds from a minutes and a half to 20-30 minutes all to no avail.  The only things I have received from these drugs are mild head buzzes and a stronger urge to sleep when it gets later in the night*

**Please help.  Where is the Euphoria?**

I seemingly have a naturally high tolerance to opiates. I can take a generous handful of Norco or percs and feel **nothing**. It's always been this way, even when I was totally opiate-naive -- I didn't build up a tolerance from regular use. The only ""high"" I've ever gotten from opiates was IV dilaudid in the hospital. 

That said, I recently got prescribed 30 percocet 10s and decided to try doing a CWE and plugging them. I searched extensively and tried to figure out the best way. There's a lot of conflicting info out there, so I tried to piece together what sounded most effective. 

The entire process seemed super messy and I'm not sure how effective it was. 

I broke down the pills (two leftover 7.5s and seven 10s = 85mg) into an empty pill bottle, added 10ml water from the cold faucet, and let it sit in the fridge overnight. 

In the morning, it was way too thick and sludgy, so I added another 10ml water. A lot of guides say to use like 100ml but that seems like a crazy amount to plug so I wanted to use the least I could. 

I strained it through a ""natural"" baby wipe (no fragrances etc) because I don't have coffee filters or disposable thin fabric. This may have been an issue? Lots of gooey white gunk was left over on the wipe (which I assume was the APAP). 

I ended up with ~12ml of fluid to plug and the experience was still lackluster. 

Please help me improve my technique! I still have over 20 pills left and would like to get the most of them. IV is not an option (veins = destroyed).",1440196961.0

This is one of three things: it'll be my fucking suicide note, the little piece of paper I leave behind that lets everyone know why he did it, like they have to fucking ask. Or it could be the paper I blindly and quietly hand over to the first person who will listen. Maybe I'll just write it all out, press CTRL+A and click DEL, and be done.
	It's time to tell people who I am, what I've done. It's time to come clean, to get this shit off my chest. So since I'm already strung out and high on the fucking misery I'm going through, I'll start at the beginning, where all good tales start.
	This is not for the faint of heart, this is not for posterity, this is not for anything I can think of.
	My name is Jerry, and in the year 2000, 15 years ago, when I was 9 years old, I became an addict. Up to that point I hadn't known how to escape the pain. My heat condition weighed me down, my pain. I had a chip on my shoulder. I was only a fucking child, I didn't know what to do. Then I found these little white pills in moms purse and, being the rebel and the adventurer, I took them. Woah....
	I kept up this trend until I was 12. I walked into the bathroom without knocking one day and found my mother with a fentnyl patch in her mouth, and she begged me not to tell dad. I don't know why I'm such a fucking prick.
	“Give me some of those white pills, and I won't say shit.” Really, it was the only way I thought I could speak with her, on her level. I smoked weed, drank a little, but I had to be fucked up to be with my mom, it's just how shit was. So from then on I was in love. I overdosed for the first time at 14, to no avail. Mom had found me, gve me CPR, lectured me and then caved into my demands and hooked me up with some percs. I wondered around blind and half awake for a few weeks after that. When you look death in the face, it changes you.
	Two years passed pretty normal, you know, normal. It was when I was sixteen that I fell in love for the first time. At first I didn't know her name, she was so beautiful though. Gathered up in lines on the glass, she called to me. I was seduced. When I blew the first line, I felt alright, the second had me dizzy, I should have stopped. I woke up to mom smacking me in the face and balling like a fucking baby, I pushed her off of me.
	“Jesus Christ dude, back off. That was beautiful and you had to fuckign ruin it.” How could I say that...
	I snorted another line, I woke up outside mostly naked, mom and her boyfriend knew I might not come back this time, so they dragged me into the snow and tried to shock me back. It worked. I was pissed. When you become love, when you're wrapped in the bliss of endless summers, the last thing you want is some cock sucker stepping in and killing buzz. I got up and told her boyfriend we were gonna drink, he didn;t seem okay with it, but he was too busy being fucked up.
	My third OD was in the same year, only a few weeks later. This one left me outside and alone, laying on a sidewalk in East Columbus. I had been alone for that one. I stumbled home and checked out. I didn't get clean until I was 19, when I met the woman I am with now, I was fucked up. When we first talked and I first drove her home, I was fucking fucked up. I think I was still fucking this other bitch too. Fuck dude I don't even remember.
	When I quit taking all the drugs, by all I mean cocaine, heroin, pills, benzos, weed; I sort of broke, over time I tappered off but I wasn't me. In the end she doesn't even seem to like me anymore. I'm better fucked up, I'm normal. Who the fuck else am I suppoed to be? I'm just here doing the best I can and it's not good enogh.
	As fucked up as it sounds I want to die. I want to be dead. I want to fucking go out with the needle still in my arm. I don't fuckign know why and it kills me because that shit's really fucked up, that's shits raw. So I've exposed it, can we get on with our lives now?
	I need help, I need something. I can't be this way, I don't want to be this way. I want to die, I want to find some way to end this suffering. I need pain pills to end my physical pain, I need the benzoes to fucking walk out into public and buy fucking gorceries, I need the psych meds to combat my PTSD and the fucking nightmares and Jesus CHRIST the goddamn flashbacks. I swear I could handle most of it, but not the flashbacks....

The box said the retail value is like $2k, but thru were willing to sell it for only $1k. 

Now my brother is straight edge, but he's not stupid. At first he was somewhat interested but after some discussion it became abundantly clear that it was a scam. He looked up the system and it wasn't even a legit manufacturer. It was some Chinese knock off system. He then basically told them to eat a dick.

Then these assholes tried to push him into buying the system and my brother would not go for it. My brother told them to back off and that he would call 911 if they didn't leave. One dude tried to sock my bro in the face and the bigger dude pulled a fucking knife on my brother in broad daylight with witnesses everywhere! My brother ran the fuck away, dude runs track so he got pretty far while on the phone with 911.

When he got back to the gas station he saw his car kicked to shit, dents n scratches everywhere and tires slashed. It took the police a good 30 mins to get there despite the police station being right down the road. I got there before them despite being 10 miles away. When they finally arrived my brother gave them the license plate number, a description of the two guys and car, and even the name and partial address of the dumb fuck who showed my bro his ID.

The cop basically said that they would ""look into it"" and left. He wouldn't take a statement or anything. Like what the fuck. I don't have a problem with cops but it's fucking pigs like these that I despise.",1440296128.0

My girlfriend of 9 years just left a few months ago and took our chikd with her to another state.  She moved on shockingly quick and had a new boyfriend within one week.   Ive come to terms with the fact that she isnt coming back and has moved on but Im stuck spinning my wheels.  We bought a house together last year and she just walked away from everything.  Im stuck in the house that we built together and its a constant reminder of the past.  She isnt letting me see my son and Ive taken her to court for it but we havent been yet and she got a continuance until a few months from now.  Fucking bullshit I have to ait in this house all day everyday and not being able to see my kid is really just too much.  She is asking that I only get supervised visitation, submit to drug testing, and asking for an EPO against me.  All for no reason she just left over a run of the mill everyday type arguement.  Ive been contemplating suicide and if she gets her way about these things and I have to have supervised visits to see my son Im going to go through with it.  I dont have a job, have enough money to survive for about a year so not really concerned qith getting one at the moment but all I do everyday is sleep in as long as I can, wake up, come out to the living room and sit on the couch surfing the net and watching tv or videos online, stay up until 2-6am and repeat process.  Its getting really old I feel like Im in the movie groundhog day and I dont know how to change it.  Im going to get a gym membership this coming week and try that for a while evwryday.  I dont have any friends to speak of because my entire being was wrapped up in keeping her happy, if i told her id be back in 2 hours from copping or whatever and i was gone for 2hrs 1min she would be calling and texting me asking where I was, so no time for friends at all ever.  Our relationship was toxic for both of us and our child so Im glad to be out of it but I dont know what to do to get back to myself.  Depression has me pinned down and the only way out I see is a bullet to the dome piece.  What should I do to turn thia situation around.  I live in the middle of nowhere and its lonely as fuck out here all by myself.  I have no hobbies aside from getting high and even that isnt doing it for me anymore.  Idk what to do can anyone relate to this and help me out?  Not looking for the typical ""sont kill yourself bro"" blah blah blah.

She has a serious addiction to poppy seed tea (which I'm sure you're familiar with), and that tied in with weed is used daily.

I understand completely how hard it is for a seasoned addict to watch your money walk, I do, because let's be honest, it's one of our number one rules not to break. The exception is when it comes to a middleman you can trust with everything but your life. (I'm the kinda guy you can trust with your life btw, even if we just met...if anything happens I'll do everything in my power to make sure nothing happens to you, it's just how I am...but that's a story for another time.)  
  
Finding a middleman you can fully trust is hard, and for the middleman that trust is hard earned. Some people trust me more than they do their girlfriend/wife/mother/brother/~~babys mama~~, etc. Around here it's tit for tat. If I can't get anything I go to one of my boys, if they can't get anything I'll hit up one of my dealers and see what's good. Sometimes I might make a whole pill (8mg dilaudid) sometimes a half, but it's always earned. Getting one pill? We'll split it, whether it's me or them, because we both know that a quarter ain't gonna do either one of us any damn good...like I said, tit for tat. It's like a junkie savings account with us.  
  
I just got back from a quick run, no car so I took my bike. My boy been waiting on his guys all day, and I told him earlier that I could get something less than a quarter of a mile from his flat...he was on a bit of a time limit, so eventually he broke down and called me back...I knew he would...downside? It's almost a six mile round trip from my house...and normally I'd wait for a vehicle, but I don't care, I shit my pants twice last night so I needed that hit in my arm stat. (and damn it, if I did have the vehicle I could've made a couple pills today, but whatevs)  
  
He called his guy back to see where he was, no answer...so he called me right back and gave the go ahead to ride over...It took me 10 minutes to go pick up his $40....a quick conversation consisting of ""*please don't burn me man*"" ""bro, you know I ain't like that, I'll be right back"" ""*yeah, I know, hurry up*"". I hit the corner store, broke a $20, crossed the street and hit up my girl.   
  
A few minutes later I'm pulling back up to the complex in my bapos beach cruiser...""How's that for fuckin' delivery service?"" ""*Hell yeah, thanks man, here's yours, call me later*"" handed him his shit and a tenner, get my half and I'm on my way back home. 30 minutes from start to finish and I'm back home feelin' decent....not high, but def. not sick....something is always better than nothing...and if people didn't trust me that's exactly what I'd have.  
  
Damn it man...fuck...someone else just hit me up just as I was about to hit submit, and I could've made another 4mg...not having your own car fucking sucks man...  
  
Tl;Dr - Reputation is fucking important in this game, and people trust me, whether it's $40 or $200. My boy hit me up for a pill a little while ago because he's been waiting on his dealer all day, and all I had to do was ride down the road from his apartment to cop. He let his money walk, I came back. He split the pill with me. Still a better love story than Twilight. ",1440276352.0

I back out some what to let people know that I'm trying to get out, well nobody gives me the consideration to let me back all the way out fir like 5 minutes. So I finally say fuck it and bully my way out of my spot. This chick in a black Mazda something is in front of me blocking the exit who happens to have enough room in front of her to pull up and get out of my way, but she doesn't move. I tap the horn and she looks up from her phone into the rear view mirror at me and goes back to her phone. I tap the horn again, again looks at me and shrugged Then goes back to her phone. I try once more to get the same reaction. At this point I'm ready to snap. I'd been trying to get out for 10 minutes now. So I open my door and get one foot on the ground and she sees me getting ready to get out and move her car for her, at this point she decided now is a good time to move her fucking car forward...I get back into my car and drive past her and give her the bird and a mean look.

3i4rk3,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3i4rk3/watson_853/,5,https://redd.it/3i4rk3,TheMoz,Watson 853?,"Question.

Got some watson 853 from a dude and because i always do this, i plugged watson 853 just to do a quick search.

Most pills the first page of google results is always nothing more than drugs.com, medicalinfo.net type stuff. That is to say, if you type just what is on the pill, all you get is basic info on it.

When i typed watson 853, the first result was drugs.com, the 2nd and 3rd were forums full of people saying these pills are whack.

I was skeptical at first, but not one person said it was okay just weak, or they had a decent time. Literally every person said they were awful products.

Whats more, is a majority of these people got their pills from a pharmacy. So the negative concensus is regarding pills that are BAD PRODUCTS, not FAKE. 

The more popular explanations are the company is putting less hydro to curb addiction, the hydro is now time released, or they messed up when they removed the dye.

Does anyone have anything to contribute regarding this pill?

I still have 10 on me and would love to pop em, but im very nervous.

The guy i got them from told me hes been taking them and claims they are legit, they are better than the yellow norcos (which i doubt).

He says they are his mother in laws and they are from walgreens. None of this i doubt. Him and i only pop pills we are sure come from a pharmacy.

My concern, as ive said, is not they are fake, but rather as a product, they are ineffective and bad. Can anyone shed any light on this?
Anyone take any white watson 853s (hydro 10/325) recently and have no problem whatsoever?

Let me explain...

A while back I became addicted to opiates after being legally prescribed them for major surgery.  You know the story... it starts off with painkillers, blah blah blah..
Anyway, I took suboxone a few times hoping it would make the w/d process easier.  It did the opposite, and upon reading up on suboxone I found that the half life is much longer than that of a typical opiate.  This means that if you don't use the correct dosage (which is difficult to measure, as the strips can be divided unequally) the withdrawals just get worse.

Desperate to quite my bad habits without going through an extremely painful process, I started looking for alternative methods of transition.  That's when I found KRATOM.

Kratom is an extract from the leaves of a plant commonly grown in  Malaysia, or Thailand.  Over there it has been outlawed, but in the United States it is COMPLETELY LEGAL AND AVAILABLE ONLINE.  Kratom is a mu-opiod, meaning that it mimics the brains reaction to opiates.  Basically what this means is that when you take kratom, your body releases the same chemicals that an opiate addiction is begging for.  I ordered about 100 grams of it for under $40 online.  Once I received it via mail a few days later, I began my recovery process.

There are several strains with different properties.  I provided a link below that quickly explains the differences below.  I waited until I started to go through some of the heavier symptoms of withdrawal (about 24 hours clean) and then I took 4 to 6 grams of powdered kratom with water.  (Kratom is hydrophobic, which means it doesn't mix well with water.  There are several techniques for ingesting it-I just tossed it in my mouth, took a swig of water then mixed them and swallowed.) Within 30 minutes my symptoms were COMPLETELY gone.  I couldn't believe it.

I continued to take 4 to 6 grams of kratom about every 6 hours for the next few days.  Then 3-5.  Then 2-4.  Then a small spoonful.  Within 2 weeks I stopped taking kratom all together.  I felt absolutely no withdrawal symptoms after that.  It was a very easy (even enjoyable) way to transition from dirty to clean.

Here are some links for further reading and research.  I can't guarantee you this will work for you, but I can promise you it did for me.  However, this is not a magical ""Get out of jail free card"", you still have to be responsible with how often you take it.  I treated it as I would suboxone and it worked wonders.  

If you have any questions I'd be happy to answer.  Best of luck friends.

3iavym,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3iavym/rise_of_the_lizard_king/,27,https://redd.it/3iavym,morbo2000,Rise of the Lizard King,"After three months of mouldering in the Darkness, I saw my face in the cursed mirror.  My road to ruin is littered with torn plastic bags, empty pill canisters and dull needles.  I hear the Priestess every night in my dreams. Come back, she says. Come back.  But I can't do it.  I won't do it.  Being high is what I know.

But that face in the mirror...I barely know him.  Has that much me really slipped by? What else has happened? I check my bank account.  Demons that move like liquid over my moods release the Panic.  Wild, uncontrollable creatures fill my thoughts.  Cynically, the world is money.  You can believe this or not. But if you like electricity, cable and internet you must acknowledge this shiny, glowing god.

And I acknowledge.  

Everything bad happens.  I run out of Unemployment.  The IRS sends me a threatening letter regarding a tax bill for a cashed out 401K plan that totals more than $10,000.  Do I have gold, jewels or anything tangible to reflect this poor decision?  No.  I pissed it away on heroin and pills.  

I got a blood infection a month ago.  Could literally be from anything. But with whiskey came many missed shots and my shooting hygiene has been poor as of late.  I went to a health clinic without insurance.  They sent me to a hospital.  So $300 to see a doctor and have his admin call an ambulance.  $7,000 for the emergency room visit.  Then a letter outlining my uninsured hospital stay.  Days start at $1,200 plus expenses.  The food was terrible and they were very stingy with the opiates.  Not sure how much of the discomfort was from withdrawal and how much was from sepsis.  But man, the agony was intense.  I was left alone in the Darkness and surrounded by machines.  Here I met a new god I will spend the rest of my life avoiding.  Pain.  

And now my bank is after me.  When Rosie fled the country for taxes or narcotics or whatever, she borrowed money from me.  A thousand here, a thousand there.  The check she wrote me for $6,500 bounced.  When I pointed this out she shrugged and said, ""Oh my money is tied up in Costa Rica.  Have my car.""  

She signed over her car to me.  I have never actually owned a car and was excited for about a day.  Then the car was gone.  It disappeared from the office parking lot.  My last message from Rosie before her number was disconnected was contact information for the repo company the bank uses.  

My only good fortune in all of this was I was too high to go to the DMV to do the title transfer.  So at home, I burned it.

My net worth is a negative number.  Rent is coming up, there is no food and I have no answers.  Well, I have one answer.  I shoot up in my right arm which is tricky but I have less bruised puncture wounds on that side.  I slip into the nod and another afternoon drifts by.  Cottony clouds of cable TV shows slide into my shiny eyes.  The warmth of my god whispering only gentle things to me brings a lost smile.  Familiar bliss.  

When I awake, the withdrawals boil through me like writhing snakes. Besides muscle aches or nausea, a new sharp pain in my gut fill me with dread. Like roof nails driven into my bowels. I double over and groan. The clock on TV says I have slept for almost 12 hours...really?  Did I OD? Maybe my body craved the sleep.  The couch has a body-sized sweat stain where I twisted and burned.  

I feel terrible.  My first thought is to shoot up.  Just a little...But I remember the visions.  I saw her.  My little priestess.  My guardian.  Unlike the ghosts that chase me across the dream plane, the Priestess is forever kind.  The Priestess shows me only the paths I need to move forward.  Not the ones I enjoy visiting in sorrow.  Not the ones that lead me back to forgotten tropical seas.  Vast oceans of blue opening up like a ghost scream...

She only shows me the path that is needed Now.  

""It is time to summon him"" whispers the Priestess.  ""Your new mask.  Your old mask is lost and forgotten.""

""How?""

""Remember!  Your boldness.  Your confidence.  The powerful man from yesterday and the broken man on the couch today are the same man.""

But he is gone Priestess.  Tortured, withered, dead, and forgotten.  But I understand. These problems are my problems, regardless of who wears the mask.

There is a Doors song that is actually a piece of a long forgotten spell.  But in the fragment is true power.  

""I am the Lizard King.  I can do anything.""

I awake in clarity.  

When your path is lined with poppies, change will come hard.  Some choose not to leave.  But most do nothing and let the god decide.  The farther you walk down the Path of Flowers the more beautiful the madness becomes.  Each step into the god's garden is one step farther away from your soul.  But do you still care dreamer?  

I care. Thankfully there is the Lizard King.  I create him with half my soul.  I agree to keep one foot in the real world and the Lizard King is my envoy with full powers.  I bind the creature that thinks, ponders and pragmatically solves complex life decisions to my lazy dreamer, self.  

When I wake up, I cringe at my weakness.  My shooting kit is out in the open and a dropped cigarette has burned the couch.  I need help.  So I summon my creation.  Give him a test run.  

The Lizard King is weak from all the years of abuse and needs a little opiate to function.  I feed him enough to stave off sickness.  Two roxies.  I go over my options.  I need a plan.  I get the mail and divide it.  Bills on one side and credit card offers on the other.  Luckily, my credit scores are based on when I had a salary and zero debt.  The Lizard King sorts through the pile.  One is especially attractive.  $20,000 credit, 0% for one year.  I fill it out and call.  I give them my offer number and they run my numbers. Everything goes smoothly until they ask about Employment.

""Freelance"" I answer.

The process halts.  I ask to speak to a superior rather than wait because I am on a business trip to Singapore, lies the Lizard King.  A manager gets on and I explain in tech jargon about Nothingness.  Nothing to show and nothing to worry about.  A Rosie trick.  They accept my answer.

Now I have a year.  Selfish me wants a shot.  Selfish me wants to figure out how to turn the credit card into cash.  But the Lizard King hangs up the phone and makes some notes in his planner.  

I go out and enjoy breakfast.  A bagel bacon and egg sandwich, coffee and Help Wanted ads.  The job market looks promising which is positive.  Then I go get a haircut.  I have rotted inside my tomb of an apartment for three months which means I am shaggy.  

A tall Korean woman with long legs and beautiful skin washes my hair and asks how I want my hair cut.  Her touch is magical and I realize I have been away from people too long.  Just to practice, I start flirting and lie about what I do.  She giggles and banters with me.  I see a wedding ring so I start shamelessly hitting on her and then I ask her out.  She turns me down.  But I have made her happy, given the two other ladies cutting hair something to talk about and I realize, I am happy too.  

As I leave, I think of Sera.  For immoral reasons at first but then I remember an email she sent me weeks ago.  Sera has a new job.  She is a recruiter for tech companies.  

With my excellent credit, I open an account at Macys and purchase a new wardrobe.  I must disguise the Lizard King appropriately.  Let them see only the bold creature in nice clothes and ignore the sick, frightened invertebrate cowering inside.  

Back home, the Lizard King does math.  I can live for eight months on what I have if I a spend carefully.  Yes, this includes drugs for the Lizard King is realistic about all matters from eating out to the rising price of illegal oxycodone.  I email Sera for more information about her work, put away my clothes and feel better.  I have taken one step in a direction.  Not sure which direction, but I have started moving.  

I sit down and open a bottle of beer.  Mycroft the fish looks at me so I feed him.  The dehydrated blood worms he eats are probably what my veins look like.  His giant glass jar looks filthy.

""I'm changing Mycroft's water"" says the Lizard King.

Actually doing stuff versus dreaming about doing stuff soon is the true power of the Lizard King.  Little motions like cleaning Mycroft's jar beget energy.  This energy starts to gather and build momentum.  Mycroft flashes around his clean bowl and I rinse his anubias plant island in the sink to clean off the dust.

""I need to start exercising in the morning again.  Push ups, sit ups, crunches and yoga to start with"" says the Lizard King.

""Ok.""

""And we gotta cut back.  No more needles.  Let the holes heal, dude.  You know what I mean.""

My gut tightens.  No more shooting until the wounds heal is his old trick.  After the punctures heal, the urge to shoot has usually passed.  Clever.  But I don't like the vague cutting back plan for I am a junkie. I need to know where I stand.  

""Cutting back?"" I question.

""Yeah.  With your usual high, I can't function at the level required to trick bosses.  Though you barely feel it and would love to be higher, your brain is mush.  Zero concentration.""

I sigh.

""C'mon we gotta climb out of the hole.  I can do this!  But I need you.""

""Alright, alright..."" I agree.

""Look a taper is all I'm asking.  No more needles.  Scale back the H.  Let's get off it and worry about the pills later ok?""

""Ok"" I nod checking my computer.  ""Hey, I just got an email from Sera.  She wants to meet tomorrow for lunch.""

""Good!  This might be the easy way back in.  A few temp jobs will get the cash flow back.  Plus I'm out of practice.  Hey do me a favor and let me talk to Sera before you go into social mode and try to get laid.  I have questions on insurance, salary requirements and shit.  Oh, and I'm working on your story.  Maybe something like you took three months to travel?  Need something for the resume.""

""Good call.""  

The Lizard King goes on about other concerns and how to solve them but I grow bored. I send him back to the other side.  

Now it is just me.  I finish the beer and get my heroin.  I have about a gram of tar left.  I smoke a tiny ball of H on foil.  Haven't done this in ages.  The high is not as pleasant and the throat taste is just wrong.   But I still have the skill.  The foil is barely burned and the smoke rolls off evenly.  Very little dragon escapes my straw.  

Things are changing.  I inspect the Lizard King's work on my updated resume.  Very impressive indeed.  I print out copies for tomorrow's meeting with Sera.  I think of smoking more tar but nah.  I'll read in bed and try to relax.  Maybe make a grocery list and polish my work shoes.  Feels weird to do normal people things but it also feels good.  I'll finish this tar and keep the pills for later.  I can always get more pills.  

Sadly, I find that thought very comforting and use it to anchor myself in this new adventure.  

I wake up on Tuesday morning in my usual panic.  Dark moth wings fluttering against the windows in my mind. Strange animals screaming and pulling at me...Bills overdue, math not adding up, sinking, drowning, choking doom. The clock says 4:44 am.  I am psychotically alert and frightened and...wait.  

Wait a second.  Remember our pact?  Remember all the work we did?  Let the Lizard King handle it.

I close my eyes and drift away. A feather falling through starlight into the sea of dreams.

Warning, wall of text.","My alarm goes off at 7 a.m. this morning. I get up, get dressed, and head out to my car to head to work/prep my morning shot. At this point I remember that I am out of my beloved ecp. (sad face). Thankfully, I had been saving my cottons, so that was enough to get me through my short little 5 hour work day. This is where my luck begins, because normally I would work either an 8 hour shift or an 11 hour shift, and without my beloved dope, I would've had a terrible day at work, sick as fuck.

So 1 o' clock rolls around and I get to leave work. I start the hour drive up to my d boys house. Once I'm about 10 minutes away I give him a call and make sure he is all good and can serve me my 3 points for $60 dollars. He answers, tells me its all good, hes at the house and to come on through. So I arrive at his house. Now normally, I pull up and he comes out, serves me, makes small talk for a moment, and I go around the corner to get right. Well today I pull up and wait about ten minutes, and he is nowhere to be found. So I call... No answer. I wait another 10 minutes and call again, again, no answer. I wait another ten minutes and start blowing him up, I probably called him about 10 times in a row.

So I start to think that he is dodging me for whatever reason and am super bummed that I'm now gonna have to deal with withdrawals for at least the rest of the day. All of the sudden, right as I'm about to leave, a woman walks right up past my car and up to the fence in front of his house and starts shouting his name. ""This is super weird and sketchy now"" I think to myself. Then I hear him! ""ahhyyywhaddup"" the old motherfucker was passed out on the couch on his front porch! I couldn't see him because he has a sheet hanging up in front of his porch lol. So she talks to him for a minute then leaves, I  shout his name, walk up and get served, and like usual, go around the corner to get right.

Right as I'm finishing washing out my nice, old, dull, rig, one of my best buds, (the one who got me into the dope game) who moved 2 and a half hours across state calls. He has been dry ever since he moved and offers to pay for a couple points for me to have if I grab some for him and bring them to him. So I decide why the hell not! Haven't seen my homie in months and haven't been to his part of town ever. So I hit the atm again, go back to my d boys house, get the goods, and start the trek to my homies place.

I finally arrive and we both wanna get high (obviously). Unfortunately I only have my one extremely dull, old rig. So we head to the local walgreens to get some fresh rigs, only to be denied by the wonderful pharmacist. That's when I get the brilliant idea of looking for a needle exchange! I had heard of them through reading this sub but never come across one in person. Sure enough, there's one only 5 minutes away! so we head there not exactly sure what to expect.

This is where the story gets fan fucking tastic. We walk in, and are kindly greeted by ""professional volunteers"" (that's what his business card said). I am then taken into a room with one of the professional volunteers where he asks me a few questions about myself and how he can help me. I explain that I need some fresh rigs and boy does he deliver! I was expecting to get one or two rigs for free, this motherfucker tosses me a box! That's right! 100 fresh rigs all for me! (and my homie of course). On top of that he shows me all the other stuff they have for harm reduction, disposable cookers, purified water tubes, alcohol swabs, air soft pellet sized cottons, rubber tourniquets, and much much more. He then says ""Don't be shy man, take as much as you want!"" So not only did we get a ton of fresh new rigs, but new cookers, cottons, purified water thingies, tourniquets, and swabs. All of this for free! Now I understand why people are so thankful for these amazing establishments!

So we head back to my buddys place, load up our new toys, and get feeling straight up DOPE. He then suggests we go for a stroll around town to show me around. We go get some slices of pizza and bob around town floating on clouds. Eventually we get back to his place and its time for me to make the 2 and a half hour drive back home. About 20 minutes in I realize I am gonna need a coffee to enhance my experience of driving home and some gas. I stop at this gas station and after trying to pour a cup of coffee they tell me they are closing in 20 minutes and they threw away all the remaining coffee for the night, but they felt bad so they gave me a free mountain dew!

I happily make it back into town where I stop at the local meijer to grab a California roll which I recently acquired a taste for and had quite a craving for. I sit down, completely house that California roll like its the last supper and head back into the kitchen to look for desert. What do I find??? Mom made chocolate chip cookies!!!! And boy were they chewy and gooey and perfect.

A big thank you to anyone who has read this far lol. I know I probably sound like I'm doing a lot of bragging, but really I just wanted to express my gratitude for how blessed I truly am today. Things went from doing ok to one of the best days of my life.",1440480511.0

How/why do the cops treat you less than human when they know you're homeless? While I was on the streets, anytime you were caught after 9 you were free game. While I was 100% sober they'd arrest, beat, steal and jail me whenever. They would always be sure to steal whatever I had at the time too. Thanks a lot...

Seriously, what the fuck?? I had no prior record until they knew me from seeing me around. Once it was known that I was homeless I was pretty much fair game whenever they felt like it.

The time i spent kicking was sleepless and confusing due to the dysphoriaband inconsistencies of the withdrawals...  

With subs you can be win withdrawal for a day and the next feel sorta well due to the long half life.. Text takes forever and us equivalent to a psych drug.  It saved me life but I am convinced it causes other health oroblems .. The month and a half I was free if it I gained the most defined muscles I've ever had and I felt extremely energetic at the beginning.. It's a slow painful chemical.  

After thirty days I started exercising and getting some of my dopamine back.. I swore off opiates and benzos then resolved myself to a clean break.  I was now 30 and a new chapter of my life no drugs.. Well even with the support of my girlfriend,  I was still extremely depressed and being back around normal people made me anxious. eventually went and scored some ECP and after a few days I was already a sick sweaty pissed off in full withdrawals.  


Long story short I'm back on subs,  kicking myself why did I choose this again.. I know I have an opioid dependency and I felt like a fish out of water off of subs except in jail.. I'm even taking clonazepam to deal with crippling anxiety. 

Any one else have this pink cloud where you feel great and stay clean for a while but the need to feel... Complete,  happy,  together.. Through an opiate over powers everything.  I was introduced to hydros and perks at a young pre pubescent age.  I've thought of ahayauasca(sp)  but don't have the funds or time atm. Anyone feel how I feel and just feel like an opiate is going to be forever needed due to Chem embalance/emotional pain? 

I've tried so hard but the longer I stay totally sober it seems all my negative traits surface,  I feel unproductive and emotionally disconnected. 
 And a few mgs of clons or alpha when I can get it.. Absolutely need the combo of texts and a light benzo.. Am depressed and isolate otherwise. 

Anyone been here?  Eventually gotten clean?

If IV isn't available, which happens commonly to IV heroin users due to collapsed veins, they will use an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection instead. I find this odd, because these are not comparable to an intravenous injection - they take longer to take effect, which isn't a good thing in an emergency, time-sensitive event such as an opioid overdose.

It seems to me that in the case where an IV injection isn't feasible, intraosseous administration would be a much better idea than intramuscular or subcutaneous. It is much faster for the drug to take an effect in the user's body, and the strength is comparable to IV. If an EZ-IO is used rather than a B.I.G. it will be more painful than IM or SC, but I seriously doubt putting an unconscious patient who is having an opiate overdose, of all things, into pain accounts to any worry whatsoever. And even if pain later were an issue, IO would be a better choice since it doesn't cause any muscle soreness afterwards like an IM or SC would - just a slight tenderness where the drill was used. 

I haven't ruled out the fact that the website would have been incorrect. It could also be that veins damaged to the point where a medical professional has difficulty finding one they can hit is much less of a problem than I think it is, and it's just so rare that the website didn't bother including it. The only other situation I can think of is that maybe ambulances don't carry equipment for an intraosseous injection, in which case it would make sense that they use IM or SC as an emergency backup.

Can anyone with personal experience or a medical background give any insight on this?",1440461768.0

Nothing is full proof but I'd like to think I know a thing or two.  From cold coppin to middlemanning to craigslist, I've done it all and hear are my two cents:

1.  ** To live outside the Law, you must be honest ** Basically, don't fuck around with people and their business especially when copping.  Dboys will always assume that you are a junkie (guilt by association) so don't need another target on your back. Don't do dumb shit to get yourself noticed (bright clothing, double parking, having your blinkers on, blowing up his/her phone, etc,) Put yourself in their shoes; if they don't reply to a text then it means that they can't help you. Don't think just because you have money you are going to be served. These guys have their own lives outside of dealing and sometimes the profit they make off selling a bundle is not worth getting out of bed at 8 in the morning to meet some ungrateful junkie who is paying in one dollar bills, always a little short/late, and always asking to be hooked up. Be upfront, especially if your a couple bucks short.  Sometimes, especially if you are going through the same guy and he treats you well, give him a little extra. Kindness goes far in this world and dboys will remember. Then again, don't expect shit in return other than a reliable connect. Think of it as a Christmas bonus for your dealer. He needs to eat too! 

2  **Break one law at a time** Piggy backing on the comment above, if you are to do illegal things, do one at a time. If you copped, don't speed home while smoking a spliff as the people in your car are shooting up. (I thought this one was a gimmie but I have met so many people, from users to dealers, who do some stupid shit that ends up them getting busted. It's amazes me how often I get served by dudes causally smoking a blunt and sipping lean in their car without a set belt on with expired tags and of course speeding and running stop signs.) If your dealer does this, then either find a new or be ready for him to get busted. Dumb mother fuckers like that are the one that go to jail. Just wait until you are in a safe place. 

3. **Try not to stand out** This is a little harder for us white boys, especially if we have to go the other side of town to score but not impossible. No flashy shit. Act cool and always have story for the cops. Hell, I knew this cat who would dress up like he's Mormon when he went to cop. Bible and all. 

4. **Don't let your money walk. Be wary of fronts** First one is just of fact of the game. Fronts, though they can be good in times of sickness, put you in debt to your dboy and if you don't pay that back in timely fashion, bam, there goes the connect. 

Probably more but I can't think of anything at the moment...",1440459427.0

So me and a buddy lets call him N usually drive down to the west side to score a few times a week. We never have had any trouble and always get right in and out. Well this time we decided to park and hoof it to our usual spot as it was about to be dusk. So were walking to the corner which was only literally 3 blocks north of where we parked and we get to the spot. As soon as were spotted the dude comes to tell us to follow him into the apartment building hallway, no biggie this is standard procedure and didn't raise any alarms. We slide in and snag 8 off him for 60. Some fire Chicago blue tape bags. As were sitting on the stairs with the hoodrats outside keeping watch we hear them yell, ""don't come out"". So in my mind there's just a CPD rolling by and two white boys out there is highly suspect so we stay put and proceed to do a bag right there before we hightail it out of there. Well not even 15 seconds later 5 CPD narcotics agents bust through the door and run right past me and N and chase dude upstairs.We look at each other like ""did that just happen"" So we stand up and slide out the door. As soon as we go out the door 3 cruisers pull up and bag us right away and throw us in the whip. Haul us off to Harrison and Kedzie district station. We get there and we're booked on possession of Heroin and spend the night in jail. Go to court the next morning and bond the fuck out on IBOND. As soon as we get out we snag squares and hitch a cab to district to get our property. Proceeded to get our shit, go get the car, cop some D to put this all behind us and rode on out of that bitch to go home. And that's how we caught our first dope case.

I did some looking around to see what strain they closely resembled. As there seems to be different verities of papavar S. They look identical to these.

How ever the website .au would mean this is in australia but it just says tasminia poppies in general. Kind of pissed I spend so much time growing these but at least I have knowledge on how to grow them. Next time im buying them from an east indian store or better yet online. They dont sell the seeds to actually grow in the seed section as they are not legal to grow here. But the ones sold as food works fine... unless they are indeed poisonous. I have made a tea a while ago using only a very small amount of these pods, a few grams. I instantly felt nauseous... :(

I drove by his house to see if he was there and I had no luck. Bummed out that my money had been stolen and I had no other available hookups I decided to head home and prepare for the withdrawals. 

As I was pulling out of his neighborhood his dealer drove right past me, which was really odd because it was nowhere close to where he lives or where I've met him in the past. So I follow him to a local store and walk up to him. Luckily he recognized me and told me that my middleman owed him money too. He sold to me on the spot with no more middleman markup or shorted bags. 

He has been awesome ever since. I call him up and tell him what I want, he tells me where to meet him, and then I call when I'm there and he shows up within a couple minutes.

I used to subscribe to /r/opiates but recently have been finding the content too provocative while trying to stop. It is however a great community with a lot of combined knowledge.

Quick history : I've been messing around with heroin and bupe since about April - my most recent relapse. IV dope user for ~8 years. I became hooked mainly to the bupe this time, with occasional dope hits. It's been just over a week without bupe.
Tried to cold turkey but failed.


What I'm wondering is how long after my last dose of bupe will it be before it is again effective for a rapid opiates detox?


I've done it once before. I went from daily half teenth IV dope to nothing after a week of using gradually reduced doses of bupe. (eg Monday 8mg, Tuesday 6mg, Wednesday 6mg, Friday 4mg, Saturday 2mg, Sunday 1mg, Monday 1mg then off.)


Doing this the only suffering I felt was some insomnia, but I hadn't taken buprenorphine for about 5 months.


**TL:DR** Want to do a rapid bupe detox from dope, but only just stopped bupe habit a week ago. How long before the bupe is again effective in this capacity? I hope I was clear.

It's a type of heroin apparently popular in Australia in the 1970s thru the early 90s but it had disappeared and was pretty much unheard of by the late 90s.

From what I've heard it was a sort of Sth East Asian no 3. Required acid to break down for injection but smoked well so was particularly favoured by rich sets who typically used cocaine and looked down on opiates & needles (though also seems to be pretty fondly remembered by Iv users from what I've heard)

Was apparently from China and made using a process involving caffeine and another fairly toxic substance (if I remember stories correctly)

Over the last 15  days after I only got 59 hrs of sleep and I was going rather crazy git tons of tests and blood work done all inconclusive  so my PMP ignored me and told me to take some Tylenol.  After that I had a tiny psychotic  break and I was committed  for 5 days for a psych evaluation.  During that time I switched doctors, got a psychologist, and am seeing who I've been told is one of the nation's top doctors who specializes  in pain and addiction.  I've been put on mood stabilizers which regulate my depression and mania.  Since I've had this pain my emotions have gone out of wack  so they put me on an antidepressant  so no more crying spells that freak everyone out and they put me on suboxone  for pain management  and to curve opiate cravings.

He was the main admin on my website (blog) and has completely shut it down, out of spite.

I will be starting a new website but that takes time and money. I will continue my series once I have it set up. It won't be as nice of a website and I may not have images, but will still resume writing the story. I hope that you guys will be patient and come back to continue reading.

This has been a very difficult 2 months for me. I never thought my flesh and blood cousin would not pay me for the work that I did, especially knowing that I care for my daughter on one income and she calls him Uncle.

As it stands, I have bills due, no money and am extremely hurt that he, not only has told me that he is not paying me and that I will have to take him to court, but moreover, that he would be so petty as to shut down my blog after an entire years worth of work, time and energy I have spent making that blog successful with around 10,000 readers. For those of you who don't know, to achieve that kind of traffic on a site that doesn't sell services or goods, is amazing. Especially, considering the subject matter is taboo and raw. I've lost all of my Google Organic search, backlinks, SEO keyword tags etc. He literally hit the reset button.

Fortunately, I have backed up all of my work with the exception of last weeks post, so I still have my writings. As most of you know, I am in recovery, next month I will have 2 years clean. I'm fucking stressed right now more than I have been in my entire sobriety am asking all of you to please send prayers, be patient and come back and read again once I set up a new website.

In addition, the unfortunate truth is that my cousin is a raging alcoholic. He lies about everything, attempts to manipulate every situation, has to control everything and the sad part is, with that alcohol in him, he has lost all control. I ask that you include him in your prayers as well. I'm sorry and thank you for reading.",1440563703.0

I just posted this as a comment, but felt afterwards that it deserved a post of its own as well.

I was surprised while reading the thread I commented in at how many users seemed lack the knowledge of Suboxone to prevent eventually having a bad experience with it. 

This guide is brought to you by over a year of firsthand experience with Suboxone. 

I have been on Subs now since last summer, and have been successfully switching back and forth from one week on Sub to 1-7 days on dope the entire time. I've had a lot of trial and error experience, here, but have only precipitated withdrawal twice. **If you have followed my instructions properly you will not precipitate withdrawal** and your experience with Suboxone will *not* be a bad one.

**BACKGROUND:**


Buprenorphine (the active ingredient in Suboxone) *does* have quite a long half-life; however, that doesn't matter if you try taking opiates *while on Suboxone.* Buprenorphine has a waaaay higher affinity for your brain's opiate receptors, which favor it dramatically more than a full-agonist opiate.

What this means is that if you're already on Suboxone, the effects of your drug of choice (**DOC**) will be seriously diminished; and when on doses of Suboxone *above* ~6mg, full-agonist opiates' (**FAO**) effects will be blocked entirely. If you're on a **low** dose of Suboxone (or if you're in a precipitated withdrawal [which I'll return to shortly]), it is possible to override the Suboxone and get high; but it takes much more than your normal dose because you first have to dislodge the Buprenorphine from your receptors before the opiate can take hold. 


**PRECIPITATED WITHDRAWAL:**

**With a note on Loperamide (Immodium):**


The problems occur when you take Suboxone *too early.* Because of its affinity for your opiate receptors, Buprenorphine is capable of knocking full-agonist opiates off entirely. What this means is that if you take Suboxone **before you're at or above a 6-10 on the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale** ([COWS] (http://www.naabt.org/documents/cows_induction_flow_sheet.pdf) which is ""moderate"" withdrawal), the buprenorphine (and **NOT** the naloxone – which is a common misconception) will strip your receptors of the opiates and plunge you immediately into full-on withdrawal – like where you're at on days 2-3 of withdrawal... yeah, it's fucked. This is call Precipitated Withdrawal (commonly referred to as **PW,** because spelling is a bitch). Duration of PW varies, with many saying it's only an hour or two; but I can tell you that I have personally experienced *two day-long* precipitated withdrawals when detoxing from loperamide (yes, Immodium in high enough doses *can* cure withdrawal – but it can also become an addiction in and of itself – not because it gets you high, but because it stops you from being sick; and yes, when you're using Immodium at such high doses, Suboxone can *and will* precipitate withdrawal – which, because Immodium's effects last so long (48 hours), will result in a freakishly long, drawn-out PW). 

**edit:** It has been brought to my attention that I neglected to mention super-long-lasting opiates like Methadone.

Chances are that if you're switching from Methadone to Suboxone, you are doing so under the direction of a doctor; but on the off-chance that you're not, you should be aware that Methadone has a completely different recommended waiting period before switching to Subs. As I mentioned in my comment reply, I don't have enough experience with Methadone to remark with any authority, here; but let it be known that ""about 12 hours"" is **not** safe. From what I recall, if you're above a certain dosage, the wait time can even exceed a week or more.

As far as I can tell, duration of PW depends on how long it *would have been* before you reached a 6-10 on the COWScale. (Note: if you do go the Immodium route, your perception of withdrawal quickly becomes skewed. What you *think* is a moderate withdrawal actually isn't – it's only the *beginnings* of sickness and it's a long, bumpy road down. The way I finally got off loperamide was to intentionally go on a 2-day long dope binge without taking any Immodium, so that I had a chance to get the Loperamide out of my system.)


**DOSAGE:**

As I said before, if you're on a low dose of Sub, you can override it by taking enough FAO (or Immodium) to dislodge the buprenorphine – but only if you're on a low enough dose of Sub (which is *one* of the reasons why it's recommended that you start small instead of jumping in with with high doses). Depending on your tolerance, you might not get high – you'll likely just not be sick (or as sick) anymore. Be careful: fixing a PW is *not* a fun experience; it's expensive, it's painful, and it sets your detox back a full day.


Other reasons why you should start with a small dose are that (some people say) Suboxone can actually be more effective in lower doses than high; and that because of a supposed ""ceiling"" on buprenorphine, can actually reach a point where taking more doesn't even do anything. Withdrawal can do crazy and stupid things to your mind, and it's easy to think:  

""ugh, now that I'm not nodding anymore I feel SOooo^o^^o^^^o^^^^o shitty! And I'm *such* an ultra-junkie and use *so much* that I'm gonna get *SO* sick. I need to fucking quit. I should just take 48mgs so there's no chance I can get high and I can just get to fucking sleep and get to work in the morning""

 – because you will NOT sleep that night. You'll most likely precipitate withdrawal and hit that ceiling where it wouldn't have even made a difference  that you took more than  24mg. 

I'm personally on the fence about the buprenorphine ceiling. When I had a fresh script that was still covered by my insurance and could afford to take whatever it took to feel well, I was able to overcome a particularly depressed induction period by taking either 24 or 36mgs (three or four 8mg strips).  I went from the most severe anxiety I'd ever felt, and like I was going to burst into tears for no reason, to what can only be described as ""utter relief"" when *finally* the physical *and* emotional effects of WDs were lessened enough to function.  I can't do that anymore, because my health insurance is no more, so I try to tough it out on as small a dose as I can stand – but let me tell you – more does in fact occasionally *do* more.


**METHOD:**

What follows is my recommended method for Suboxone induction – which I have been following myself for the past year:

1) Decide you've had e-fucking-nough and that you need to get clean.

2) Use the rest of your shit such that you're able to get a good night's sleep. **Try your damndest to use the last of your stuff 12 hours before you wake up.** 

(The overly-simplified instructions provided by [NAABT] (https://www.naabt.org) [The National Alliance of Advocates for Buprenorphine Treatment] and from the creators of Suboxone itself say to dose ""12 hours after last use"" – but it's *not* that simple. Some opiates last longer than others and even heroin can be cut with something such that it can take up to 24 hours before you're clear to dose on Sub. Regular old dope, though, *should* be safe to after 12 hours.)

     NOTE:
     ""About 12 hours"" is kind of a safe **average** (somewhere between Oxy and H's) wait time; but this figure is mostly geared towards relatively ""pure"" heroin (not enough other opiates in the cut to drastically increase its duration). 
     Street heroin (that doesn't consistently kill its users) ranges somewhere between 20-70% pure). Again, not all drugs are safe to switch from at 12 hours; some will be safe *before* 12 hours; **and Methadone is a whole other beast entirely.**

3) If your dope doesn't have ridiculous legs, you should wake up feeling pretty nasty. If you feel like crap (and can confirm at least a 6-10 on the COWScale, proceed directly to step 5).

4) If you're not yet sick enough, hold off until you are. Seriously. Substances that reduce withdrawal symptoms (helper substances) are like, basically any drug, really. I've had good effects with Kava or Valerian extracts, but my favorites are Adderall (seriously, it kills withdrawal for me entirely) and weed. Alcohol can also help, but the comedown tends to make withdrawal worse (which is also true with other drugs [you know, if that *have* comedowns], so the lesser the comedown any drug has, the better a helper it will be).

5) I have had good luck taking Suboxone as soon as I'm a 6-10 – but I have also recently begun waiting *even longer* (with the help of whatever helper substance I feel like using that day, of course). For me, by putting off dosing on Sub until the end of my first day of withdrawal, I've found that by ""trading in"" a ""first clean day"" that's a little little extra miserable, I'm able to ultimately dose with less, feel better on day 2, and subsequently keep my dosage low longer.

6) Take your first dose of Sub. Here is a sub-list to help you gauge how much you should take:

     a) If you are taking *below* 80mg of Oxy, or if you are taking *less than* a bundle of dope per day, start with 2mg.

     b) If you are taking above 80mg of Oxy, or if you take more than a bundle of dope in a day, start with 4mg.

     c) If your withdrawal involves excessive diarrhea – or especially vomiting – upon waking on your first day, definitely start with at least 4mg-6mg. If you just ""feel gross,"" but aren't sweating profusely or even feeling all that anxious, you're not that bad off – so don't psych yourself out – you got this!

7) Now that you've taken your dose, remember that sublingual buprenorphine takes ONE HOUR TO KICK IN (and this is independent of stomach content). At the 30-minute mark, you will feel a little better; but the drug's effects won't be fully established until it's been an hour. (Note: I have found that sometimes, I paradoxically feel better before one hour but then feel worse once the Sub kicks in; and have even had times where I ceased feeling sick *only* when I actually had the Sub under my tongue. I can't tell you what to do in that situation because I haven't figured it out yet, myself, but lately I would say to smoke some weed and ride it out.)

8) Once the Sub has kicked in, take a short while to assess how you're feeling. If you feel OK (and really be brutally honest, here – know that if your dope tolerance is very high, you're just not going to feel 100% during the first couple days without a little extra help... or a goddamn miracle), you should probably just tough out the first couple days so you can keep your doses down. Not only can you then transition back to opiates (if that's what you want) sooner, but you won't become too dependent on Subs (which is good because Suboxone withdrawal can last up to a month) so getting your dose down as small and as quickly as possible is a priority.

If you still feel too sick to realistically function (totally subjective – but for me – if I'm still sweating and feeling waves of heat flashing up my back, I can't do much of anything except wish I could make it go away), take another **2mg.** (If, let's say, you were puking, however, and your first dose hasn't stopped *that,* then I would say to take 4mg.)

9) Repeat steps 7 and 8 every hour until you feel OK and could reasonably function. To phrase that a little differently – a little clearer: If you still feel sick an hour after your first dose, take another 2mgs and wait the hour for it to kick in until you *do* feel better. It might take a while (I've wasted entire *days* just sitting around, squirming, waiting for doses to kick in), but it's worth not starting on a huge dose (that you then have to take days to taper down from) when you only really needed 4-6mgs to start.


**TAPERING DOWN:**

**edit:** *I can't believe I forgot to mention how to lower your dose in the original post!*

Buprenorphine is great because its withdrawal is very mild when lowering dosages, and was ""designed"" for rapid detox (rather than long-term maintenance). The most painless way to taper down on Suboxone is to take whatever dose works (""Dose A"") for at least two days – this gets you acclimated – and then on the third day, lowering your dose between ~25% to ~50% (this usually works out to 2-4mgs at a time). Take that dosage (""Dose B"") for another 2 days. Repeat.

**Let it be known that being on Suboxone for too long can have adverse effects.** 

I used Sub recreationally for about 6 months in my early 20's.^* I eventually felt that enough was enough: I loved many things about taking Suboxone recreationally – it was cheap (8mgs for $10 lasted me at least a week), it helped me last longer in bed, and it was like a secret security blanket that I didn't have to feel as guilty about as heroin.... BUT I started to feel like I was losing my personality: I didn't laugh as much anymore; I got angry very easily and far too often; and I started to have a hard time finishing when having sex. 

Once I decided to quit, I used this very same 2-day-dosage method to bring my intake down to **1/10th of 1 milligram** and *still* didn't feel right for a month. The lower your dose is to start, the shorter period of time you'll be on the drug in the long-run, and the lesser your discomfort from cessation will be.


**\*\:** There is a lot of dispute about this in online forums, for sure. But it should definitely be more widely known (and believed, frankly) that **if you do not have a FAO tolerance, you will get VERY fucked up from even a small dose of buprenorphine.**

Here is a table showing a super effective 9-day course to bring you down from 8mgs to 1mg:


Day|Dosage
:--:|:--:
Day 1|8mgs
Day 2|8mgs
Day 3|6mgs
Day 4|6mgs
Day 5|4mgs
Day 6|4mgs
Day 7|2mgs
Day 8|2mgs
Day 9|1mg

Now this is stupid simple, for sure; but you can start however high you need to and follow the same pattern for whatever dose works. With higher doses, rather than reducing by a percentage, you'll probably want to reduce by 2mgs at a time: that results in the least dramatic withdrawal.

Not a week has gone by in at *least a whole fucking year* where I didn't get high. 

I'm on Subs. Any of you who have used Suboxone for any length of time know that, while it *does* diminish withdrawal dramatically, it doesn't *eliminate* it entirely for the first couple days. This is called the ""induction period."" For the last year, I've been either high or in a perpetual induction – and the first day I felt normal was either the next time I got high or day before I did.

Well, for *once,* being unemployed has helped me. As my savings  have steadily drained to nothing, I've finally reached a point where I literally cannot afford to use.^^* But so today, after two weeks – not feeling sick at all – I copped a bundle; and you know what?

In the past, I have tried other kinds of drugs (weed, X, LSD, Shrooms, which were mostly very positive experiences), but I've never done any kind of opiate besides maybe like Vicodin after I got my wisdom teeth out :P (and never to get high).

Anyway, through some interesting circumstances (long story) I happen to be in possession of a few grams of heroin. It seems to be the tar kind and not the powder, not sure about ""cuts"" or anything because I have no idea what dope is supposed to smell like or look like really. Again, very new to all this.

Anyway, my main problem is what am I even thinking?? This seems like a pretty huge step up (down? back? I don't know). However, I honestly can't deny that I'm curious.

So I guess my basic question is how much should I try. Everywhere I've looked is directed at people who are first time H users, but not naive to opiates like I am.

A follow up question would be how should I do do it? I watched some videos of people smoking it (which I wanted to try first so I could not OD accidentally), but it looks pretty technical to me.

Sorry if this totally in the wrong sub, or if I didn't do something right. Looking for a bit of guidance if you happen to have a bit of time :)",1440527433.0

My storie: I've taken a few times Furanylfentanyl (FF), like this: 1 week FF - 1 week clean - one week FF -  etc

Now I was again 1 week clean (the withdrawals are so fuckin annoying, but not like a 6month real Fentanyl withdraw, which was my first years ago...)
So now I did something really stupid: I vaped ~100mg of not the best, but also not weak FF. AFTER I was again 1 week clean and 90% normal again. 
I have now (stopping the binge) a HUGE tolerance and what made me puke hours ago gives me now a little nice buzz. I have very little FF left..


I'm pretty desperate right now, I took everything in one day because I didn't wanna use it anymore. I won't buy opioides again the next few weeks/months.
So how hard will I ""crash""?
Does an one day binge (a fucking huge one for me) really let me do the withdrawal again from zero? 
Do I need to taper down a few hours, or the next day?

Btw, I got 20mg Lope (can't get more), Lyrica and GHB.. I hope this will help the crash.

Please don't make an idiot out of me, my english is, as you can read, not my native language  and I'm not very good at it.

PS: I did everything in one day, because I thought ""fuck it, if you'll stretch it to a week again, it will be worse"" - Was I right? :(

PPS: I don't need tipps how to take the Lyrica, Lope, GHB (I have BDO, but it will be metabolized into GHB, so for me not a very big difference). I know them too well^^.

In one cognitive-behavioral therapy study, ondansetron patients with early-onset alcoholism had fewer drinks per day and reported more days without drinking at all, as compared to the other groups in the study. Also of note, individuals with the LL genotype show significant improvements in alcohol misuse when treated with ondansetron, compared with individuals with the other genotypes of the 5-HTTLPR region of the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4), who showed no improvement over placebo.[27][28][29]

Ondansetron might be useful and effective for treating withdrawal symptoms of opioid addictions.[30] Unlike the existing treatments methadone and buprenorphine, it is not itself an opioid.[30] Additionally, it does not require continued supervision like treatment with clonidine.[30]

The original experiment used mice that were injected with increasing doses of morphine, assayed with naloxone, and then underwent haplotypic analysis to isolate a gene candidate.[31] HTR3A which codes for the 5-HT3 receptor emerged as the primary candidate, which suggested 5-HT3 antagonist ondansetron as a possible treatment.[31] The researchers were then able to show using an acute morphine administration model the efficacy in withdrawal symptom control in humans.[31]

Thats the important part from the wikipedia page. Apparently it has serotonin activity. 

Has anyone had success mitigating their withdrawals with this drug?

Well here I am one week later.  I've slowly increased my Lycra dosage and I've gone from around 300mg a day (prescribed is 180mg) down to 100mg inside of three days with no problems.  None of my normal flu like symptoms have occurred and I don't feel as much of a craving.  It really is a miracle drug for opiate withdrawal symptoms.

If it's ER, would I be safe to take the whole 80mg pill in one go? I can pretty much handle an entire OP 80 for comparison.

Since it's ER and basically abuse proof (meaning it's near impossible to even chew these things up, I hear they're like jaw-breakers) how long will it take to reach a peak? Is there even a peak with these things? 

For $20, would you buy it? 

Thanks guys, hoping at least one of you has tried these things before, because according to a Google search, it appears that all but a handful of people have actually even heard of them and not a lot of info on the abuse spectrum of them, just a few actual patients that need it for pain have chimed in on this new wonder-pill.",1440770977.0

FOREWARNING-WALL OF TEXT

Well, anyways.. A friend had stopped by to con me into selling him some of my recent crazy fire pick up.. He knows from me and his previous experience with my shit that it isn't your average, run-of-the-mill bullshit that anybody that's anybody in my fucking state seems to have; it's as pure as it fucking gets.. Give him a small amount because besides it being fire, hes kind of a lightweight. He disappears into my bathroom or kitchen, not exactly positive where he got everything prepped and did his shot, but i'm in my room getting all set at my dope station. Next thing I know, I hear a **CRASH BANG BOOM**, but me just feeling my rush and getting oh so faded, didn't think much of it. Then it hits me.. THAT'S MY BRO! I fly into the kitchen, kids doing the pretzel on the floor, flip him around and hes starting to turn a little blue and barely breathing. Splash water on him, slapping him around a little bit, calling out his name, administered CPR, anything I could think of to snap him out of it. Nothing's working, and I'm minding the time, because I obviously don't want a good friend to (a) die or (b) have any brain damage. After realizing I had only one last resort, I called 911, got them over here, and after 5 shots of Narcan AND using the defibrillator (he had ACTUALLY DIED on my porch), he is alive and well, and currently being monitored at the hospital. He's too good of a kid to fucking die at such a young age.

 With a firm, controlling hand, the Chinese donut lady commands the mass of wasted, after hour revelers.  In twos and threes they stumble forward for donuts and coffee.  Fried, sugary delights to soak up excess booze and put drug fractured minds back on track.  Hot coffee to animate the bones of the drunk and drugged.  On a cold, black winter’s night by the bay, there is nothing better to rekindle the soul than donuts fresh from the fryer with a cup hot coffee.

 I can watch the Chinese donut lady all night.  She is my role model.  I aspire to be as efficient in my employment when I'm all grown up.  They should make her a required class at my university.  You can tell from her harsh, unwavering glare that the Chinese donut lady hates us all.  We are beneath her dignity, but she is a professional.  You never wait more than a few minutes for food.  If you're too wasted to talk, you can groan degenerately and point at what you want.  She'll even count your money if you’ve travelled way past the point of math.  

 Kym lowers the bag of ice she got from the Chinese donut lady and places a cigarette between her glossy, lollipop-purple lips.  Wow, her cheek is swollen.  Poor thing.  There is probably a life lesson in all of this.  Like never throw a pint glass at security.  I learned that ghetto bouncers who are puffed up on steroids do not live by the 'No hitting girls!' rule.  Luckily Kym fell backwards just as the ape punched her because he was big.  Like Sasquatch smashing cheek bones big.  

 Kym winks at me through purple eyeliner and pouts her candy lips as I reach over and light her cigarette.  The pointer finger on my hand is grotesquely swollen from sucker-punching the bouncer.  Another lesson.  Never strike a neanderthal on his long, flat shallow braincase.  Next time I'm sucker-punching a neanderthal, I’ll aim for it's throat.  Jason was upset at Kym as we ran away but appears to have forgotten.  Let bygones be bygones.  But this is the third club we have had to flee since Kym has turned 21.  Probably just a coincidence...Melo shakes his head at us as he gets up to check on Dev who went to the bathroom to puke. They were on their way to meet us when we ran past them yelling ""Cops!""

 ""NEXSHT!  NEXSHT IN LINE!""

 Yum Bakery, San Francisco at 2:37am.

 Melo comes back supporting Dev who looks a little pale but smiles.  Kym slides a chocolate Devil's Food Cake donut with rainbow sprinkles towards her which she starts nibbling.  Dev takes out her yellow Walkman from her Guatemalan knit bag and hands Kym an earbud.  They sit there listening to music and smoking cigarettes.  Kym listens with her right ear, Dev with her left.

 ""Imagine the thoughts being transferred between their brainwaves"" smirks Jason.  

""Moths..."" breathes Kym.

 ""Hummingbirds!"" smiles Dev as she widens her eyes.

 ""Hey.  Do you think the cops are looking for you guys?"" asks Melo.

 Fair question.  I know Melo has drugs on him because he was meeting Jason to sell some.  Jason might have a warrant or two.  But I don’t.  So I shrug and go back to my chocolate old fashioned donut.  

 ""No way they’d look here!"" says Jason as the cafe door chimes: BingBONG!

 ""Babe"" says Kym quietly looking down at her half eaten blueberry jelly donut.  ""Cops.""

 Two plainclothes walk in.  A woman and a man.  The woman is in charge.  Her butt-chin face swivels around the cafe crowd suspiciously.  Through her tiny, wire-rimmed, smart-guy eyeglasses she scrutinizes us.  Beneath her asexual haircut, is a short, bullish, vicious looking creature in a wrinkled suit.  The young Mexican cop that trails her looks bored and unhappy.  

 ""Jeez"" smiles Jason sipping his coffee, ""don't they even try to look undercover anymore?  Like these two would ever hang out in public.  Kym!  Doesn't that bitch look like Elton John in a cheap suit?""

 ""BWA-HA-HAH!"" laughs Dev suddenly coming alive.  ""ELTON JOHN!  CHEAP FUCKING SUIT!""

 Kym covers her face, Melo hugs Dev close to muffle her laughter and Jason and I stare at the cop.  So do other customers who start snickering.  Maybe it's the glasses or the haircut but when Dev yelled 'Elton John!', the lady cop morphs into Elton John.  

 ""Shut up Devika!"" giggles Kym into her coffee.

 The whole scene is getting sloppy.  Drunks in line start wandering around to check out the cop and the process is interrupted.  But, like a pro, the donut lady brings the crowd back under her control with her LOUD, barking voice.

 ""NEXSHT!  NEXSHT IN LINE!""

 The cops walk towards the counter.  Kym turns to me, wraps her arms around my neck and kisses me deeply.  The world fades.  I forget about the Now.  I let her beauty and the feeling of her lips melt away reality.  Nothing but You sings my brain...and Kym smiles as she pulls away and slides out of the booth.  I stare at her ass as she walks off to the bathroom. Goddamn.  The younger cop watches her ass walk away too but he does so professionally.  He stops halfway down the aisle and plants himself defensively to keep an eye on his partner's back while the Elton John cop casually strolls to the front of the line.

 ""Boo!  Cheater!"", mumbles a drunk.  

 Another one grumbles, ""Cutter!""

 The angry Chinese donut lady could care less about cops.  She ignores the cop and serves the drunks wobbling around at the counter.  Kym comes back from the restroom and I look at her.  Distant eyes, a zombie strut and she looks like she has wandered away from reality.  She slides in next to Dev, picks up the earbud, shoves it in her ear.  Before I can comment,  the Chinese donut lady screams, ""NEXSHT!  NEXSHT IN LINE!""

 She bags two chocolate donuts and a cinnamon twist for an obese guy in an Erasure t-shirt.  He farts loudly as the Chinese donut lady hands him a large coffee.  She takes his cash, gives him change.  He does not tip or apologize for farting.  

And she moves on.

""NEXSHT!  NEXSHT IN LINE!""

""Did that fat guy just fart?"" asks a mesmerized Jason as the fat guy walks past us.  He glares at us but keeps moving.  

 The whole donut show is bizarre from our booth.  Dev laughs maniacally, Kym looks bored, Jason is staring deeply into his lighter flame and I’m trying to figure out what they are listening to on Dev’s Walkman.  It's bouncy and something from maybe 5th grade...Duran Duran?  Poor Melo is trying to look nonchalant but cops make him nervous.  Plus we are wasted.  Dev is on a hallucinating amount of MDMA and ranting.  Kym was coked out of her skull and belligerently drunk at the club.  But now she is quiet...Suspiciously quiet.  Jason and I ate LSD gummybears.  We ponder the Universe while remaining useless and lame.  And Melo is sober.  Poor bastard.  Hanging out with us is like taking a bunch of cats out on yarn leashes and trying to cross a street full of dancing mice that shoot laser beams from their eyes.

 ""You see this is Female caucasian tonight?  Early 20's, brunette, glasses?"" interrupts the Elton John cop to the Chinese donut lady.  

 The Chinese donut lady gets pissed when anyone fucks with the donut flow and stares back defiantly for a moment, shakes her head and turns back to her customers.  BingBONG!  More drunks amble inside like foraging bears attracted to the delicious scent of fresh donuts.

 ""NEXSHT!  NEXSHT IN LINE!""

 ""Hey!"" yells Dev to the cop.  ""I know you!""

 To our horror, Dev gets up and starts walking towards the lady cop.  She appears to be in a trance as she lurches forward.  Guided by her unnaturally large MDMA pupils she approaches The Law. 

 ""What the fuck?"" whispers Kym in a hushed tone.

 I look at Kym and see powder around her nostril.  I reach in my pocket and baggie of China white is gone.  Kym pick-pocketed me when we kissed.  Amazing.

 ""Wipe your nose dear"" I whisper back.

 Kym smiles at me dreamily, wipes her nose, snorts and then goes back to watching Dev TV.

 ""Ms. Liora.  Nice to see you again"" says Elton John cop.

 ""Maddy!""

 ""It's Officer Elizabeth Madison.  Are you interrupting me because you know this person?"" asks the cop showing the flyer to Dev.  

 Dev doesn't even look at it.

 ""Nope!  I have a question!""

 ""Ok...""

 ""You're like, old already...So what feels better?  Being happy in love or the first time you ever fell in love?""

 The younger cop shakes his head and walks off.  Just being in the donut shop makes him self-conscious.  He doesn't workout as hard as he does to have drunks and junkies whisper cop-donut jokes behind his back.  

 Officer Madison looks at Dev for a moment and then she pinches the bridge of her nose to stave off the migraine she gets from working graveyard shifts in the Tenderloin.  

 ""What?” questions Officer Madison.  “You mean like the very first time you ever fell in love?""

 ""Yeah!""

 ""Falling in love"" sighs Elton John cop.  ""Nothing like it.""

 ""I feel the same way too!  Like it's raining stars and flowers and my heart is ticklish!"" laughs Dev like a loon.

 Elton John cop smiles patiently at Dev.  This is a lady with a gun.  Then she rolls up the flyer and walks out.  As the cops leave, Kym nods out.  I watch her do a slow motion face-plant into the table.  The array of silver bracelets she always wears chimes and clatters as she knocks Jason's coffee over.  He stares at his lap in disbelief.

 “Oh putain de merde !” he grumbles.

 “What?” asks Melo.

 “Casse toi!” groans Kym from the table. 

 From her mop of blue hair I spy the Walkman earbud fell out.  I can hear the song clearly and as the vocals begin.  I stand up and shout, ”Her name is Rio, she don't need to understand!”

 “Fuck that was close” says Melo as Dev sits back down grinning like an insane person.

 Then Dev starts to sing, “Oh Rio, Rio hear them shout across the land!” 

""I feel like a hamburger"" says Jason.  ""Not hungry.  But like I AM a hamburger.""

Melo stands up and looks at me.  ""Pick her up dude.  Let's get out of here.""

""NEXSHT!  NEXSHT IN LINE!""

Phase III of our study begins July 29, 2015 and ends on December 31, 2015. 


So…

Do you party with Percocets, OxyContins or other painkillers without a prescription… Or use them not as prescribed? **Are you 18-29 years old, and do you live in Rhode Island?**

We’d like to invite you to participate in our study!

I fucking love heroin. I love heroin so much, when my fiance was ready to leave because I couldn't stop, I said, ""bon voyage""; I just didn't care. It was and still is a love triangle between drugs and the love of my life, my girl.

50 days or more (i don't actually count because today is day 1 of being off everything), and addiction is still rampant. I go to NA regularly, the same program I considered a joke, for a few weeks. I Don't know if the 12 step thing is for me, but I'm giving it a go anyway since nothing else I've tried worked, and trust me I've tried it all.

When I say I'm still an addict, I mean what I say. Every morning I wake up anxious as fuck, shaking, even under K-pins (prescription), feinding for any fix I could find. I don't even like alcohol, but I found myself drinking every morning just to get through the morning.

If you are thinking of trying heroin, or any other opiate. Just don't. It's not worth it. I think about it every day, all day. That warm, no fucking care in the world feeling. It's not worth it, man. I'm fucking miserable and I'm not even sticking a needle in my arm. Active addiction sucks, but from what I heard, non-addictive addiction sucks too, sometimes for years.

I read that certain drugs can cause it but I couldn't find anything explicitly saying that any of these drugs cause it. I can't really recall if it started while I was using tramadol or when I started using heroin so I'm not sure which of the two, if either, might have caused it. I'm wondering if it's a side effect of doing heroin that will cease if I stop using it, or if it's something permanent that came from my past large tramadol habit. I also used to be on the antidepressant celexa so it could have even resulted from that for all I know. I don't drink or do any drugs other than dope currently.

So has anyone else experienced this?",1440837336.0

Example: Before I leave my house to meet my human (sorry, I don't know the American dialect for dealer -- ""human"" is the word here in greece), I stroke my house keys 3 times. 

Another: If I happen to catch the bus, it is ""a good sign"", as in, I will get an extra. If I miss the bus and see it leave, it is a bad sign: Cops stopping me to check my ID, my human ran out of dope, etc..

3itbsb,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3itbsb/oh_my_goodness/,44,https://redd.it/3itbsb,kitsune-san,Oh. My. Goodness.,"This is a story about some awesome dope I got.  If you don't want to read the most insane dope story of my whole life (coming from someone who *never* posts dope stories because mine are always so mundane), or if you want to judge me about not being careful, I encourage you to pass over this thread.  If you *are* interested in kitsune's Back To School dope adventure, you're at the right place!

I usually don't brag about having fire dope.  I usually don't post about my scores or getting high.  All I usually talk about is receptor pharmacology and neurotransmission with a few sprinkles of my Sterile Vial HR techniques.  

Just as a background though, I'll usually pick up 1.5g at a time and it'll last me ""3 days"" - the night I get it (8pm when I get it to 11pm when I decide to sleep before being forced to pass out by a heavy nod, thus having to worry about ODing and getting expelled again in the moments before I sleep), the whole next day, and then a wakeup shot the next morning (plus sometimes I can spread out 2 more shots; one for noon and one to look forward to at night after work/school).  I suppose some would call this just ""one day plus 5-6 doses"", but I digress.  I'm primarily an IV user, but I do go back and forth between snorting and shooting; typical dose is like 0.1g if I want to make it last, 0.25g if I want to enjoy myself.

Today, I have to just say to all of you - Wow.  This is the best dope I've had in my life, and as ridiculous as it is to say it, it might be some of the best dope in the world.  It is so amazing that I had to post how *amazing* it is.  I scored just one single gram Wednesday because I owed the friend of mine I was going through about $100 cuz of an issue with weights and *of course I'll just take the extra gram and pay for it later*, sans the $30 extra I had on me haha.

After driving 3 hours one way to acquire it (I didn't realize he'd only be 1 hour away the next day and wanted to celebrate moving out of my parents house for the next 8 months or so), I used my milligram scale to snort a 50mg bump.  I didn't even bother weighing the whole thing though because this guy is more like a friend than a dealer and treats me so well I literally don't even have to worry about him cheating me (literally every batch has been varying degrees of fire, every single time - it's so good that I always tip him even though it's more expensive than what I usually get, just for being always reliable).

Wow.  0.05g had me pull off the interstate and vomit on the side of the road.  I was falling asleep so I had to go eat some propylhexedrine (it's a lot like meth; to make it, pharma companies directly take methamphetamine as the precursor, then literally hydrogenate it.  Think: partially hydrogenated soybean oil. Except, meth), drink some caffeine, and have a half hour snooze while I waited for it to kick in.

Unfortunately, I somehow wound up sitting on the floor of a convenience store, staring at a bunch of bottles of beer, trying to figure out which one was the RedBull.  After the PXE kicked in, I was like ""fuck what is even going on"", quickly threw up in the bathroom, bought an energy drink, and wondered to myself what kind of shitty place I must be in for the employees to think it was totally okay for me to be nodding out like that on their grimy floor.

Being just barely alert enough to not feel as if I was a DWI risk to other drivers (there were no other drivers, it was 2am when I woke up, but I still didn't want to endanger anyone else), I managed to get home in 5 hours.  Upon getting home and wondering how 1/5th of the dose that typically makes me nod hard could keep me fucked to oblivion like I had no tolerance, I proceeded to run a couple simple purity tests without bothering with reagents.

There was less than 1/22nd cut, i.e. it was over *95% purity*.  It wasn't bullshit fentanyl analogues, it was over 95% quality diamorphine.  I proceeded to put it into a sterile vial where I meant to dilute it to 1mg:4units, but being fucking high I put 0.5g in 4*50mL of water and tried to shoot 40mL a few hours later.  At this point, I have to thank my other friend for giving me a *ridiculously long* 1/2"" long 29G, 1cc needle because I ran out of my typical 5/16"" x 31G x 0.5cc insulin spikes and slipped out after shooting 5-10 units.  

While vomiting again, I noticed that there were *literally crystals of heroin* forming and re-dissolving in this vial because I had concentrated it in hot water, thus pushing it past the point of supersaturation and causing crystals to crash out of solution and ""precipitate"" yet only be dissolved exceedingly slowly because the solution was saturated anyways, so these crystals could just float around.  I know for a fact these crystals were diamorphine because nothing could have possibly gotten into the solution that would contaminate it with shards as such - I had filtered with a 0.2µm wheel filter after a 0.5µm glass prefilter and a fiberglass 5µm prefilter and cotton filter.  Plus I was massively fucked up off of just under 10 units (and concentrated fent would kill basically anyone).

After diluting the vial the rest of the way to 1mg/unit, I have had this vial for almost 4 whole days and I am just now 2/3rds of the way through it, getting high on like 20mg shots.  This is ridiculous, considering that I usually use like *five times* that much, but I am *not* complaining.

That's it I guess.  tl;dr: Got massively insane dope that some quantitative measurements marked as 95%+ purity and got reeeeally high for a long time.

Also, condescending, preachy, and non-circle-jerk-y comments are unappreciated.",1440823461.0

I broke my month long daily habit 3 times and suffered horrible withdrawals over and over and started using every 3 or 4 days again. its a bullshit way to live. I just get slightly sicker and sicker on my off days until the urge to use every day is too high. I have maybe 1 or 2 good days where I feel almost NORMAL and then I get high and its another 3 days of misery wondering what the fuck is wrong with me. 

I spent today driving around, smoking cigarettes, and feeling every ache and pain in my body. it sucked. and then I think back that I probably had many days like this before I ever used heroin. except I just dealt with them. I had no way to escape totally so the urge to use wasn't there cause I had never used before. but now that I know theres a way out and when im feeling shitty I cant really rationalize how much shittier im gonna feel after I come down unless I sit and think it over. I get so sad and lonely sometimes it gets almost unbearable and I just get in my vehicle and drive and drive and drive and drive. exercise really helps but the couple days after using I cant even bring myself to go for a run.

I don't fucking know. my goal is just to save enough money to go travelling... try to feel that wanderlust I used to get before I just wanted to do dope all day every day. I wasted my entire summer and it makes me want to cry. last year I slept outside, went mountain climbing, bathed in rivers, got a killer tan.... then I started using dope a lot and I spent all my money and focus on that. I ache for what I lost.  plus heroin makes my liver hurt now. I apparently am one of those few people who gets major dysfunction in their liver and gallbladder from using dope frequently. to the point where it worries me that im gonna do serious damage to myself if I keep going. 

even thru all the withdrawals, PAWs, health, emotional, relationship, etc problems I still know im gonna use at least once in awhile. once every couple weeks or so?? def cant handle a weekly thing. god damn.  I wish there was a medicine I could take when I feel that horrible ache and worthlessness and anxiety to make it all go away. oh wait there is... HEROIN 

fuck our brains right.. I hate my brain. I hate it so much. life for me is basically just trying to string along enough clean time so when I use I don't have to worry about being dopesick. I want my fucking free lunch. I want my cake and I want to eat it too. god damnit",1440818824.0

Depends on how long you use and how much you dosed daily.

From my experience - 3 months using .3-.8 gram per day (Smoking) 

Day one -(Last dose at 11am, it's now 11pm) 12 hours past last dose, start feeling restless and shaky. Literally can not lay still in bed, or sleep at all. Tossing and turning all night long. 24 hours past last dose, Start feeling sick to my stomach and begin having the shits really bad.

Day Two - 36 hours past last dose: Still shitting my brains out, not solid shit but runs. At this point the sickness really starts setting in, Begin puking everything in my stomach and can not hold any sort of food or liquid down for more than 5 minutes. It's the 4th of july and i feel extremely guilty and go to the firework show with my girl and daughter, puked in the park non stop. 48 hours past last dose: after being sick all day, it is night time again. Sickness has not eased. Sleep is impossible, tossing and turning and severe stomach ache. Dripping sweat like crazy, can literally smell the heroin coming out of my body in sweat. 

Day three - 60 hours past last dose: Thankful its daytime again, night time is hell. Extremely sick still, still unable to eat or drink water. Spent the day in bed, in extreme discomfort. My brain feels like somebody took it out of my skull, dipped it in acid, and put it back.  72 hours since last dose: another dark painful night. At this point I still have the shits, but now I am LITERALLY shitting out stomach acid. Feels like hot water coming out of my ass. Turns the toilet water pure yellow. No shit, pure stomach acid coming out. The same time I am also puking the acid. I send my girl to the gas station to get me a slurpee, and chug it as fast as i can, knowing that it is coming back up but at this point I am desperate to throw something up besides acid. 3am and I go to the ER because I am in so much pain. I was given an IV to put water in my system, which felt nice, but got no relief for my symptoms. I am in the ER for about 2 hours and during this time I filled up 5 puke bags and had to shit acid out 3 or 4 times. They treat me like a junkie and send me home, not feeling any better at all. 

Day Four - 84 hours past last dose: Eating all the nasuea/cramp prescriptions the ER gave me, but it did not help. Nothing has changed. Now my throat is RAW as fuck and my abs feel like I did 5000x situps. My arms and legs feel like rubber. I still have not slept or eaten since detox began. I have now lost 15 pounds in 4 days. I am drinking Ensure, and pediasure, fighting to hold in for as long as possible so my body can absorb nutrients. When it comes up I am actually relieved, it tastes about the exact same as it went down. I took about 6 barf bags from the ER, and they have all been filled up already. Smokin weed and takin valium to attempt to feel better, does not help much, except to relax me. 96 hours past last dose: Another dark night. At this point I am starting to lose it a bit, still sleepless night, except I am dreaming while awake before jolting out of it. 

Day 5: 108 hours past last dose: Was hoping to see a light at the end of the tunnel, however there is no improvement. I am in so much pain from head to toe and can barely think straight. Decided it's time to get help. Get a ride from my girl to the methadone clinic, walk in there literally wearing sweats, a robe, and slippers. Go through over an hour of paper work and evaluation. Finally they give me a dose of 50mg liquid methadone. Start going home having to fight the urge to puke up the Methadone, literally puke in my mouth and swallow it. Get home, lay in the bathtub for 20 minutes, and the methadone kicked in, and the sickness was gone. Got up and got dressed, was able to smoke a cig for the first time in days. Actually ate some food and kept it down. Slept for 16 hours that night.

I continued to go to the clinic every day to get my dose, I am quickly back to normal. Eating full meals, sleeping, even doing yard work. Stayed on the methadone for TWO weeks only, because I hear the detox off that is even worse. After stopping the methadone I experience depressing for 3 days (Never knew how depression felt before that) and after being off the methadone for 4 days, I feel human again. Finally back to normal. Happy and thankful to be alive and swear up and down I will never use again.

10 days later I am using heroin again. FUCK.",1440785221.0

I have afghan #3 heroin. For the last two months, I've been using mostly ECP or other forms of #4 (ROA: insufflation).  With this new #3, I'm smoking it....  and have had the weirdest feelings.

1. I can't catch a nod.
2. I literally ended up being able to sleep for about 1.5 hours last night, then my ""mind"" was awake for the rest of the night. Yet when I finally got out of bed in the morning, I wasn't dead tired either. It was a weird form of insomnia.
3. When I wasn't able to sleep, around 3am I even took a shot of scotch and smoked a little more pot. Laid on the couch for awhile; no sleep.
4. It's more euphoric than I ever felt with #4.
5. I'm able to get a boner on #3. I haven't had a sex drive in weeks thanks to my #4 usage.

Sourced from a DNM...  feeling weird about this.

So he's telling me that because I've been scoring off him nearly every day for about 2 weeks he rewards loyal customers (news to me ! Lol) So I get a half G and a tenner bag (0.2) he weighs it out and gives me just shy of a gram about 0.92g which is great for me I wish he had company over more often ! 😏
  So I leave and think of a place to go for a hit with the tools I had picked up from the chemist on the way to my dealers . Only place I can think of is a public toilet just of the high street in the middle of town . So I go there and cook up my charge no problem in one of the stalls and get myself pretty easily even though I forgot to bring a tourniquet. 
  I still have about 2 hours to kill so go a cycle down the shore and stop a couple of times for a smoke and enjoy the scenery. Then decide to head back I've still got about an hour so decide to have another hit and go back to the toilets though it's quite busy this time. I wait for a stall and get set up . Try to get myself ,register go to push in it starts to sting a check again and I'm out arrgh ! Do the same again and again. So I'm starting to get a bit flustered and paranoid with all the people coming and going and eventually give in as the tool gets clogged .... FUCK fuck and double fuck ! I hate losing or wasting drugs its devastating if it where money I'd easily take the loss and brush it off in about half an hour but drugs are a whole different ball game I'll mull over that shit for days ! So I carefully put the clogged shot in my sin bin and do a few laps of the town centre and go for my appointment . Then head home 
  Once I'm back I take out the shot and snap the needle off the tool and push out the deep red worm on to the cooker . I add a little citric to it and go make a coffee and when I come back the citric has broken a good bit down and turned it into some what of a puddle . I add about 70ml of water and cook it up and has a pretty good consistency . I filter the liquid up using roll up filters and some gloop it left behind on the spoon but not much and after cooking and filtering I've got about 60ml . I then scoot it onto a clean cooker and do the same again with the filter standing up so it gets filtered more than if it where lying on its side like I normally do . I repeat this three times so in total the liquid has been filtered 4 times and is basically the consistency of water and put a tiny bit on my finger and give it a taste and it tastes just like a normal hit :) manage to get myself pretty easily and it was not bad I defenetly felt it :) and was about a 0.3g hit before I fucked it up . So I'm happy now and gently nodding . Happy days !! 
  Quick question to our U.S. Peeps that IV are roll up filter tips not avalible in the states ? As I only see people using Q-tips and personally I wouldn't trust using them as I also normally keep my filters will a few units on them for a night cap or in the morning and I've never had a dirty hit/cotton fever in 10+ years of use ... Touch wood ! Have a good Friday every one !

 Some pics of me cooking up the congealed hit . I would not recommend doing this for old hits IE more than a day or even a few hours old and defenetly not someone else's blood which I've seen people do !! Yuck ! And extremely stupid !

From the land of draconian drug laws where we hang drug traffickers!!



But guys its not as bad as it seems, let me explain
Normally for first time offenders we will get a 1 year sentence (serve 8months or 2/3 of the sentence) and 2 years urine testing
Second offence 18months (serve 12 months)
Third offence 5-7.5 years
Fourth 5-10byears
For dealing its more serious
First offence 5 years ( serve 2/3 of the sentence)
Second offence 5-15 years
Third 10-life impriosonment




Singapore drug officers are horrible self righteous cunts. There are many cases where they lie to you to entrap you into getting drugs for them, in return for enormous sum of cash or reward. This is where they charge you with dealing and possesion 
7 years in prison.



There was 1 where the drug officer requested 3gram of weed from an insurance agent in return he will sign 3 policy from her, huge money for her to earn. THE WORST PART WAS THAT SHE NEVER USED DRUGS IN HER LIFE AND SHE GOT THE WEED FROM THE RED LIGHT DISTRICT SINGAPORE. AND THAT SON OF A BITCH CUNT CHARGE THAT POOR LADY WHO NEVER TOUCH DRUGS 1 DAY IN HER LIFE TO 2  CHARGES INTENTION TO SELL AND POSSISION FOR DRUGS SHE HAD TO SERVE 7 YEARS IN PRISON. SHE WAS 22.




1 more story for you guys.
My friend was at the bad part of town . An drug agent approach him appearing dope sick. My friend offered to give him a smoke of heroin to cure his sickness. Notes- my friend was spotted because of his pupils and track marks. He offered to help that guy because he had 22 grams on hand.
Anyway, due to my friend kindness and dumbness he brought the officer to a public toliet where he was ambushed. 
This happened 2 months ago to my good friend of 4 years. He was a great person and a smart person he was about to enter university ( only the top 25 % of singaporean can enter uni. This proves how functional and smart he was)
I recently spoke to his mom he was sentence  to 48 months and is currently in prison seeing the shrink for crushig  depression. His bright future is ruined

What I do to feel better has defined me. You became you with all your flaws and mistakes and triumphs and support. I became that guy everyone is told to stay away from. Bad news, ha. I wish I could have been different, because this godamn empty home echos the silence that assures me I've been left here alone. 

I hope your day is better, you should go do something with someone you love. You should freely accept yourselves and accept the ugliest bits others expose to you. I apologize if you're made to feel less than human, if once lovers now treat you as if you've become a leper. I would take your burden as my own, if youd let me. I have nothing much else to offer. I will be your dumping ground for hurt and lost ideas and runaway feelings.

Sorry, I wanted to talk. But there was no one to say this to.",1440879043.0

I'll give you a quick run-down of some of what's happened. I had an IV heroin problem for about 2 years and this February I finally decided to go to rehab and get clean. I ended up being sober about two months before relasping (my first post here) and then went to get sober again. Fast forward a little over four months and I'm still clean.
I met this guy about a week or so ago on Facebook when I posted how many days I had been clean. He asked me what I thought of suboxone maintenance and then asked me to dinner. He just barely got clean like 3 days before we hung out and things have been going so, so well but I guess I'm on edge about some stuff.
I know I should wait to be with anyone, especially someone else who's in recovery ESPECIALLY someone who's only 11 days clean. Today he couldn't cum when we had sex which he blamed on subs but I automatically assumed that he had gotten high and began looking for other signs he had. It also makes me really nervous that I'm with a dope addict that's never shot up when I'm a dope addict who has.
Part of me is really optimistic about it and part of me sees this becoming Kurt Cobain and Courtney love... I guess I want advice or something. Reassurance maybe? But don't reassure me if it's not your honest opinion.",1440877371.0

It's a 35 minute drive to the meet up spot, we get there and she goes to dudes car, they drive off and I end up waiting for 30 minutes for them to get back. Upon her return I can tell from the irate look on her face she got hosed. What was supposed to be a half Oz ended up being 3.5gs lol WTF!! I was beyond pissed that they couldn't give us the decency of letting us know that they didn't have all the product. Oh well today after she gets more she is going to give me a half for driving far for almost nothing.

What to do?,"This may sound horrible, but I really want it. Its a fresh bottle of twenty-five 7.5mg Vicodins. When I go to her appartment to cop some bud, she'll always scale it out in the kitchen with her back turned towards me. The fridge is literally right there and resting on top of it is the bottle, in arms reach. Im pretty stealthy, im just scared it might rattle a bit and she will notice. But if I could just slip it in my pocket while shes scaling the bud, real quietly, Im home free. Theres dozens of people going in and out of her house, so it could be anyone.

But, I know she actually needs them for her pain and I feel real guilty even thinking about it, but goddamn Id be on cloud 9 for a few days at least. Hydrocodone is my all time favorite and I havent been able to get my hands on it in a while.

I guess what Im asking is, what would you do? If you were almost certain you could get away with it, would you do it? Would morale cause you to rethink?

 Welp guys I went ahead walked to the headshop, and got 14 capsules(9 grams total) of the Maeng Da kratom and took 10. 45 min later i took the other 4 as i started to feel like i was coming up but it wasnt as intense as id have liked it. I then went outside to smoke some herb and holy shit...I was faded as fuck. Itching, euphoric the whole 9 yards, it was like taking percs for the first tine again lol I was pleasantly suprised as i thought it might just be a slight body buzz. That was 3 days ago, and yesterday i went ahead and bought 30 grams of the bali and after trying that id say i like it a lot more than the maeng da, though both were incredible. Sorry for the wall of txt took like 11 grams this morning and im feeling groovy lol

TLDR: Tried kratom for the first time and it was amazing. Thanks for all the help all you beautiful people and happy nods",1440866711.0
