I lurk here from time to time because I find this sub quite interesting. I notice the R.I.P posts everynow and then, and decided to write a poem about it. It's called, Bulletin Board.","In a town by the sea,


Stands a Bulletin Board,


Where all the residents tend to be,


And all try to ignore.


&nbsp;


There’s a little known problem,


About this town on the sea.


It comes from a poppies blossom,


And is quite a tragedy.


&nbsp;


On the bulletin board, those in mourning,


Pin pictures of loved ones and eulogies.


Hoping to spare themselves until the morning,


from the drug that's ruining the community.


&nbsp;


Pastor Bill recites his sermon,


Over the flame of a bubbling spoon.


But Sunday has already determined,


He's not coming back anytime soon.


&nbsp;


Mary is the school teacher.


She loves to watch her kids learn,


about shapes, books and Safari creatures,


But H is what she really yearns.


&nbsp;


Jack runs the General Store.


He has everything from milk to the Beatles.


But if you ask for something more,


He’ll give you a deal on the needles.


&nbsp;


Pastor Bill was the first to be pinned.


On the Bulletin Board with his picture,


It read “He was good and never sinned,


until he met H, and ran away with her”


&nbsp;


Next was Jack,


 He had a little fun on the job and kicked it on the clock.


Since Jack sold the best smack,


They gave him the biggest spot.


&nbsp;


Last was Mary.


Surrounded by crayon drawn letters from her kids.


They said “She was so sweet, kind and caring,


but we saw her arms, and all she did”


&nbsp;


The Bulletin Board only grew bigger,


It never healed the rifts they tried to mend.


If you're holding a gun to your head, please, don’t pull the trigger.


Just make your addiction come to an end.

I'm currently on 100mg of methadone, going to the clinic daily, being a good boy, and most of the time I'm content with that. Some days are harder than others, and here lately the hard days are becoming more and more frequent.

I have no direction. I have no idea what I want to do in life. I still live with my mom. I feel like a failure and a loser. It's hard to go from having a constant goal (acquiring dope and getting high) to just having a giant void. 

I know this is just a phase, and eventually I will have things to fill that void, but until then I know this will be a constant battle against myself. Is it wrong to miss the chaos and destruction? It looks so appealing when you aren't in the middle of it, but when it's actually happening you realize it's fucked.. 

I consistently, almost every time I sleep, have dope dreams.
Last night I had a dream that I was with a couple friends and I scored a good amount of tar (which is odd, because I've only seen/used tar once in my opiate career, mainly used ecp) and for some reason I just could NEVER use it. Something was always preventing me. First my brother was yelling at me not to do it, then I escaped that, got my kit out, mixed up a fat shot, and then realized none of my rigs had fucking plungers. Just shit like that, it's always just out of reach, and when I wake up all I want is to catch a nod, and that feeling can last all day long.

I don't really know what the point of this post is. I guess I'm just rambling and venting my frustration, fear, and confusion. Sometimes I hate the thought of dope, and truly want to be free of it's grasp. But, at the same time, sometimes I want nothing more in life than to pump ol' reliable full of the ichor.

If you read all of this, thank you. Even if you didn't, thank you. Just for being part of this community. I love you guys, please be safe, this game is a gamble with your life.",1460811800.0

In prep for this I had stopped taking my subs a good bit ago. Idk how long exactly but I didnt take any today! Well, yesterday I suppose now that its 5am.. I was starting to get the tinges of WDs because I stopped taking my suboxone to feel the H more, but I fucked up and had to do just a tiny sliver of a shot just now because I woke up at 4am sweating and yawning and with restless legs. I will still probably feel the H tomorrow just fine but still, FUCK AM I weak man... I just thought ""if I dont do a little now, I'll be regretting the fuck out of it if I have to drive 30 to 40 minutes while in full blown WDs.. esp if he takes longer than planned to get me the dope."" So I just shot 1-1.5mg of sub to get me well enough to even get H. I can break through that, right?

Sleepy rant.,"We don't have needle exchanges here, but luckily we don't need a script to pick them up from the pharmacy either. Sounds simple enough, but not all pharmacy employees want to make it that way. Why the fuck do they have no interest in harm reduction practices? 

When they're a pain in the ass and don't give you decent rigs, assuming you leave with any at all, do they think they're being good samaritans? I can only imagine that they immediately call their mom and then their Sunday school teacher after work and say, ""I helped someone turn their life around today!"" 

Wrong, idiot. JUNKIES GONNA JUNK. We all know this too fucking well. I'm gonna find some other way to get these drugs into my bloodstream regardless. Just watch me.

I just don't understand this type of logic, or lack thereof, that the pharmacy has by making a simple needle purchase difficult (or impossible). I guess when some unfortunate IV user ends up with an infection, disease, or whatever since the pharmacist decided to be a giant dickbag, they'll potentially end right back up at the pharmacy. But now they're buying medication to deal with whatever nasty shit they wound up with. 

This doesn't seem like the better outcome to me, but what do I know? I'm just a dirty little drug addict trying to buy a box of 100 insulin syringes so myself and my friends don't wind up hurt, sick, or worse. Good thing I was able to get this box elsewhere just a few minutes later. Everyone is taken care of, and we're happy junkies again.

In closing, here's a quick note to the particular pharmacist who spurred this wordy as fuck shitpost--

--Don't tell everyone in the front pew the part of the story where you flipped off my (very patient) dealer/friend through the pharmacy drive-thru window. I'd hate to think that they might be as unreasonably judgemental as you were, and view you differently than everyone else! Oh the horror.

I never used suboxone so I have no clue. I plan to buy them, I just want to know how much of them I should buy. Btw, what if I end up with 8mg, can I just like, cut them in 1/4 with a scissor, and take one if I need 2mg? And start cutting when I start taping?

I want to take it for my pain, but every time I take morphine orally I feel like shit and my pain isn't reduced much. It feels similar to about 30-60mg codeine, which I also fucking hated.

Oxycodone and fentanyl felt really good to me, and the oxycodone was oral (only 5mg too, I have a very low tolerance). IV morphine felt great.

By feel bad, I mean I just feel dizzy and delirious, no warm nice feeling, more of a fever dream feeling. It's weird and offputting. Barely any pain relief as well.

Is there a way to make oral morphine feel better? Should I take two, or will that make me feel even worse? I'm aware of the differences in oral bioavailability but I don't care too much about ""wasting"" it by not plugging or IVing it (sorry... might consider plugging though... maaaaybe).

This week several stamps of heroin fell on my hands. i've done two of them over the last week or so.

ANYWAY today i took a quarter of a xanax bar (.5mg) after work, didn't really get high or anything just chilled a bit. About an hour later I snorted 10mg of heroin. Since I'm still building tolerance I typically do a 10mg bump every 40min or so until the bag is gone. It didn't dawn on me until after I did that first bump that I had taken xanax... I am ASSUMING that it's a small enough dose to not be a big deal especially since I didn't really feel anything from it, but since I always hear about how dangerous benzos + opiates are I figured I'd check with the experts :) 

PS sorry I over-explain long stories about everything I am a writer I actually cannot help it lol

TL;DR - Took .5mg xanax at 6pm, and around 7pm snorted 10mg heroin. Is it safe to do a little more h or should i quit for the night?

It's really stressful and I'm becoming unsure but I know that this is a huge opportunity for me so I'm going to just keep at it and do my best. It's just a lot of work and a long time, ya know? 

Any insurance agents here? I guess I'm just looking for some assurance that it'll be ok, I'll pass and understand the job. I'm an intelligent guy who got a lot of 4.0s in college, but I'm still worried...

Advice?

Ps. I'm posting on this sub because I love you guys and it's the only sub I frequent. I'd rather get advice or first-hand experience from you guys than any other sub because y'all are good people

Edit: thanks everybody, I knew you guys would make me feel better. I did the first part of the course and it wasn't so bad. I did online school so it's just like that. Kinda fun even. I have to go through a bunch of courses before I take the actual test to get my license and each course has a test at the end of it. the only thing I'm worried about is what /u/treveera said.... I hope I didn't get myself into a pyramid scheme type shit, but it does have some elements that are weird. and some videos and pamphlets that are totally like propaganda shit. but I looked up the company online and 99% of people said it was legit.. so... I guess I'll try it out. if it doesn't work out with this company, I can always take my license to a different company and work for a different insurance place... 

also, don't ask what company it is... lol. no offense.. but thanks guys. hope you all are doing well and staying smart and safe! :)",1460743751.0

*Dope.* The word itself stung my ears, but with whimsy. If you're strung by a bee, don't you check to see what it looks like?

Here it was, a portal to heaven and hell, all in one. In my 20 years of life before this point, I'd experienced a lot. Should I listen to the serpent, tasting the forbidden fruit I'd been so warned about?

Under a haze of weed, adderall, alcohol, klonopin, and xanax, it was safe to argue that my judgement was clouded, though I knew I'd be trying it that night even if I was stone sober.

""Why don't you split a bag with me?"" J repeated.

J was the most despicable person I knew. His lies, melodrama, and overwhelming sense of self-entitlement made his presence near unbearable, but the excessive amount of pills he was willing to dispense to anyone willing to listen to his woes made me bite the bullet time and time again. J teetered on the brink of total insanity since I'd met him, but what poly substance addict would turn down free pills and now this time, free dope.

""Do people use dope occasionally? Without becoming addicted?"" I replied. 

""Of course dude,"" he retorted, as I chose to believe this inaccurate response to an answer I already knew.

I sniffed the bag. I opened Pandora's Box or more realistically, the Lament Configuration.

Dope seemed so innocent back then, giving me the super-powers to quell my social anxiety, all at a fraction of the price of percocet

I just miss the time period of about a year ago, I was working, making good money, I'd go to one of my childhood friend's house (his house not his moms) and he'd have fire dope on deck that he'd have from our mutual connect. So every day (especially on pay day) Instead of the usual D boy bullshit, I'd just drive 10 minutes to my homies house, grab whatever I needed, and we'd chill for hours on end. It was the perfect setup, we had a lot of fun. Since then hes quit and im on maintenance meds and I just cant help but flash back to the good times when my biggest fear was if the kid would pick up his phone or not (at first hed answer 99% of the time and tell me to come thru 90% of the time, or at most wait about an hour or so if hes busy)

I just miss it all, I guess. I miss the high, I miss chilling at my boys crib, I miss the feeling of getting a fresh unopened bag of fire, and then being in the comfort of my homies house just getting faded and chain smoking stoges while he cooked some shit for us to eat and we'd watch banging TV shows or football or good movies and sometimes play xbox. I guess it felt so good because (although time was slowly fading and my life was slipping away) it was perceived as if my life and problems were put on hold everytime I entered his house. I'd leave good and high, usually with a little to spare for later in the night. Now I dont get out at all unless its a sub appointment or some other obligation like class. 

Edit: I DONT miss: Being dopesick, having to scheme up money only to barely feel relieved for an hour or two, never being at peace in my mind, constantly just wanting to be at my friends house getting high, feeling awful and defeated when I KNEW I wasnt going to get money for the day....

My advice to all of you from experience: stock up TODAY! Dealers will not be out or willing to come to you once there's around 1-2ft of snow on the ground. 

-Stock up with enough dope, food, and other necessities (foil, needles, water, flashlight, toilet paper, etc) for AT LEAST 3 days. Not because it's for certain you'll be stuck, but because it's a possibility. 

-keep a shovel, change of socks, extra jackets & pants, water, a flashlight/batteries and food in your car. Getting stuck is only as bad as how unprepared you are. 

-If your car isn't snow ready, don't take it out like it is, no matter how dope sick you are. The buses will run as long as there are cars on the road, and have things like chains/extra weight that make them safer than your car. If you need to go out, this is a safer (even though it's a pain) option. 

It's always better to be prepared than shit out of luck, no matter how dumb or out of your way you think it may be. A forecast of 2ft can easily turn into 4ft or a 60 degree sunny day here.

Nearly 70 percent of Americans are on some type of pharmaceutical. But people who use street opiates/heroin are viewed as fucking scum. It's the most demonized drug (well maybe meth) there is, and I get it, a lot of people have died using heroin (or throw their lives away) but 99 percent of those I'm sure were an accident. If these poor people knew what they were using and had access to medical grade opiates I can imagine it wouldnt have caused an accidental overdose. And if it was legal then maybe all these street junkies could function enough to get a job and contribute?

Opiates help me be a functioning member of society, with them I go to work happy, I talk to my family more, Hang out with my friends more often, I have more empathy (sick, I know), I work out more, play more music, listen to more music. And without them I'm an anxious depressed sack of shit. I know alcoholics who can go into any gas station and get their fix and in a way I envy the fuck out of them (besides the addiction part). I really wished we lived in a world were all of us could walk in CVS with a smile on our face and say ""hows it going' clerk? Lovely day isn't it? How about I get 200mg's of diacetylmorphine, 250mg's of oxycodone and this big ol bag of sour patch kids.""

I wish all drugs were legal and I've felt this way before I used opiates. Why can't adults make the choice for themselves? The (US) government has failed so fucking hard at educating people on drugs it makes me sick. I wish the war on drugs would end, maybe it will. Idk. I kinda wish someone could change my view on this so I wouldn't day dream so hard about it. And at the same time just to confuse you I really wish I wasn't dependent on a mother fucking  drug, but for all the bad it's brought me it's also given me so much (I think?).

My right eye has always been weaker than my left eye because it was damaged when I was very young, making it hard to see out of, very sensitive to air, heat, etc. but it looks and functions, for the most part, like a normal eye.


Lately I have been nodding harder on heroin by taking as much as I can without passing out. I've noticed in the higher doses that my right eye starts rolling down and to the right, which makes it really difficult to see anything as I get double vision.


I take heroin to prevent panic attacks, stop panic attacks, cope with my mental illnesses.
I just had some ketamine and it triggered a panic attack after I read some things on the Internet here:


https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/1fluby/after_quitting_heroin_i_have_double_vision_and/


and here


https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2n8kfg/lazy_eye_when_high/


Is it possible that I could get a permanently lazy eye that is rolling around and not synching with my other eye?

I am sooooo worried and I feel panic coursing through my veins but I don't want to go back to my prescribed Xanax/temazepam/Valium because I will get rekindling.
My panic attack isn't as bad right now because initially I thought I was going to die because ""the ketamine killed my tolerance to heroin because it's an NMDA antagonist and it also potentiated the heroin and now I am going to overdose on all this heroin I'm nodding on"" lol....",1460823825.0

It may even be sad how much it makes me happy to just hear from someone checking in or when someone just generally talks to me in a genuinely caring conversation. Or when people want to help me out and be nice to me out of their way; holy shit does that make me seriously tingle with good vibes.

So do you cop locally, the darknet, or both?  Do you feel you're getting your money's worth?  If your a daily user, do you cop enough for a few days, a weeks, or more?

Including more info would be great like: ecp, bth, no 3..

[do you have a regular dealer or do you go through middles?  Do you get delivery, pickup, cop on the street?  If you don't get delivery how far away do you travel like 10 min, 30, an hour or more](/spoiler)

If you use the darknet how much do you spend at a time, how l9bg does it last, and do you use it out of necessity like lack of local dopeconnect or preference.](/spoiler)

If you use the darknet do you feel you're getting your money's worth and are you a daily user?

I planned on buying a shitload of coke, dope, and bars, so when he told me that he can't help me because he's getting sober, I was straight up ready to cry. 

Then my luck starts to get worse. A couple days pass, and my middleman sent me a text saying that he got more h. I was happy as fuck. We set up a time for the deal and guess the fuck what? He never responded. I had a ride and lots of money, but he didn't text me back until a day later. He texts me again telling me that he's finally good to go and I told him as soon as my ride comes and gets me, I'll be ready to meetuo with him. My ride never came. I'm freaking the fuck out and wondering why. She was busy getting her ""groove"" on while I was sick and hating myself.

A day after that happens, one of my friends texts me saying that she can help me score. But as usual, my ride isn't ready and I'm left at my house blowing up her cell and getting no response.

A day after that, my friend texts me again and tells me that one of her friends is trying to sell some dope asap. I try to set something up since I didn't have my money with me. I text my homegirl and ask her to bring me my money. She says yes and I'm like fuck yeah I'm going to finally get high. TWO HOURS LATER, im texting her like crazy asking her when she's going to meet up with me. She texts me that she can't do that since she's ""tied up"" The guy with a dope texts me saying that he's very close. I had to tell him that I don't have the money and sorry for wasting his time. As soon as I sent that message, my homegirls tells me that she's 5 minutes away with my money. I immediately text him, but he told me that he doesn't have time to come to my side of town again and to hit him up next time (I texted him and he never responded back)

Or do you want to share part of your story to maybe save a life down the road? Now's your chance!","Hello!
First off let me begin by saying thank you for taking sometime to read this post and hopefully you can help me out! I am pursuing something that interests me a lot and would like for you to participate if you'd like. So long story short I've been trying to find my purpose or direction in this world and have been doing some self exploration. I recently celebrated my 90th day clean from my heroin and meth addiction. So to replace my old habit with something new, I have started learning new habits. Well one of the new habits I have started incorporating is meditation and trying to communicate with my inner soul/self. Well I believe I have the message I wanted to receive.

I have a passion to help others because when I can bring happiness to someone else it creates happiness for me. Well what I would like to do is write an eBook about lies that drug addicts have said before to obtain their fix or whatever they desired at the time. I want to include others stories and lies other than my own, so the story has a look into different addicts sharing the same disease. It's possibly away for some addicts to finally come clean about a lie they have said in the past. Not only is this away for addicts to get rid of some guilt they've been holding onto but for readers it might change their views on people with addictions.
I hope for this story to be raw material and anything allowed. This will make the story interesting and also show the way a addict goes above and behind to continue their addiction. So what I am asking is if you have a story you want to share about your experience or maybe of someone you now and would like to come ""clean"" about a lie or something you did but you weren't confident in telling anyone now is your chance! You can write about absolutely anything that you've encountered on your journey with addiction. This is a chance for people who don't know anything about addiction to see the world as we do, and maybe prevent someone from stepping onto this path we all are on.

If I get enough feedback from people in order to write this eBook, I will post a link for you all to have a chance to read it. One last thing I would like to add is if you wish for your story to be written as anonymous just include that at the end of your post. The way I want to structure this story is if it's a bunch of letters. So I would like to include a name or something for each story. It doesn't have to be your real name or your full name or you can use a screen name or whatever you want as your signature. Just include it at the end of your post or like I said you can stay anonymous. I hope by doing this maybe I can help other addicts like myself come ""clean"" about something they've done in the past. Not only is it away to fight this disease head on, but this eBook will be a chance to apologize because who we are during our addiction is not who we truly are. We are under the control of the disease and for some it's an easy thing to destroy for other's it's not. Thank you for your time and I hope you can help me!

In a town by the sea

Where people sometimes hang out

Stands an obituary

And the news that it carries makes me shout




So bad is this heroin epidemic

That our kids get addicted

It killed my friend Nick

And it made me so sad that I wanted to talk about it so I reddited.





People get addicted to this terrible drug

And do crazy things

Like when then broke in Grandma's house and took her rug

And rings




Annie had kids but she the drug she still shooted

They were so cute it would make the town smile

But CPS took them in the night, while they were bare footed

And Annie was high on smack all the while




On the obituary they wrote the name of Terry

He died because of some fentanyl laced bags

Nobody was merry

His dog left behind, his tail still wags





Pete took so many oxis he died while he slept

He could have lived long, it was bad luck

His parents found his body and wept

From my poem I hope you junkies wake up and give a fuck




Please stop your addiction, so you don't get on the obituary

Like Pete, and Nick, and possibly Annie if she doesn't go to rehab, 

And Terry

Also don't drive when you high on this very strong drug, call a cab




You might think that it's hard to write poetry, because it is

But sometimes lots of feelings give you a powerful image, like the obituary

And so you I tell you please stop drugs while there is

still time to get free

My good friend Donald has been dating this girl for about 2 years now and it's been THE WORST 2 fkn years of our clique's existence. This BITCH of a woman is the devil with a violent heroin addiction. Lemme kinda clue y'all in to what I mean. So for these past 2 years we've seen our friend go from functional junkie to homeless, carless, unemployed, and generally non-motivated junkie. This chick has robbed his parents house, she's robbed my house when I let them stay at my place for a few nights, she stole from my friend, and another family. She's a huge klepto. She always tries to force Don and I to steal her shit from department stores. Not only that, but she has no sense of other people suffering. When she's sick all she cares about is getting well, but wont let anyone else get well because she wont give up the foil until she's hit it 6 times and a dub has become .05. Now most of my friends and I don't allow her to join us because she's just such a self centered ass, but on the rare occasion that we do let her come along we always regret it. When we call her out for being selfish she instantly hops on our ass and says ""now i know your true colors"" and thinks were the ones in the wrong! (How delusional can you be??)

I feel so bad for Don because he is suffering and Idk how to try and explain to him how he needs to break it off if he wants to ever become productive and happy again. What should I do? I just want him to return to his old self. I can tell he wants to end it, but I think he's afraid of being alone again as I'm sure she has him whipped.

It's the strongest and only opiate I've had other than codeine which I was addicted to before I moved on to PST which felt far stronger than even A CWE on pills containing 600mg codeine total.

So with that info in mind, I'd love your thoughts on what amount of oral morphine dose equivalent you reckon I was taking. Thanks in advance guys, I'd really appreciate it.

I know this sounds like a troll or whatever, but even just using PST from supermarkets I got horribly addicted and horribly depressed at the same time, to the point I had to be hospitalized twice and resulted in me wasting about a year and a half of my life, and dragged me into I pit I'm only just emerging from.",1461036592.0

Sorry for the negative bitchfest but I have nobody else at this point.,"So my girlfriend (unofficial fiancee) of three years left me. A bunch of shit I could've done over time to be better. Fuck. But seriously I have never been this attracted to physically, mentally, emotionally, etc. to anybody. And it was the same for her. Inseparable. 


We clicked in every way. Sexually, especially. Always satisfied. That's important to both of us. She knew of my use from the very start, and I was highly functional, working full time, etc.. Long story short she helped me get clean when I knew I wanted to. Things were fucking great. 


This is the only person to change my view on marriage and children. She wanted children with me, of all fucking people. She's so intelligent, and just simply the most selfless, disciplined, and caring human being I've ever had the privilege of knowing. Part of my attraction. Everything I ever dreamed of, and never thought I'd get. 


I got my life back on track, completely, over the last year. And then she left about three weeks ago. I'm seriously alone. She was my best fucking friend. The only person to show me that happiness is possible without drugs. That I'm worth something for being me. She actually got me. And I got her. The things she said-not spiteful or anything, because it's not in her nature-but honest. They hurt so much. A lot of what apparently needed to change was out of my control. I just couldn't do anything about it. But the rest was all me. There's so much more about her and me, mainly her, I can't describe it. To give you and idea, she's just the type of person everybody loves/falls in love with. Literally, EVERYBODY. 


I just hate myself now.


I've completely 100% fucked up everything else starting before and during this time period. Work, school, and probation. I'm losing my hair. I think I already was but now it's fucking bad. I'm fucked. I'm seriously fucked. I seriously feel so goddamn lost, I have no idea what to do. I don't want to be here anymore. I was planning on an ending it last week, but I fucked it up and fell out before I could do the rest. And now I'm broke. I know all of this is my own goddamn fault. FUCK.

She ran at me with it onceci told her no and tried to stab me. My friend was in shock, I grew up in the house so this wasn't really a crazy new thing for me but my friend is a very empathetic caring sort of individual at heart and took a liking to my mom after living with me for 2 weeks so he didn't know what to do. I waited for her to come to me because she was all unbalanced and fucked up. She tried to stab with a downward motion of her arm so I caught her forearm mid air and disarmed her. My friend was distraught, and ran out to the porch. I can't believe my mom pulled this shit on a friend of mine. So he's sitting on the porch I'm trying to talk to him get through to him etc and my mom comes back at us from the front door with a butcher knife. She tried slicing my friend on his back and I grabbed her from behind and tossed her aside. I dived for the knife and asked her what she really thought she was gonna gain by doing this shit.  Anyways so shortly after that we leave for the day and I can tell it's really bothering my boy all day. I just try to eat bars and forget. I'm not planning on going home til I know her small supply we GAVE HER is out. So around 6 pm we come back home and chill and by 11 fall asleep. I say nothing to my mom or dad about what happened. So the next morning I wake up do my little morning routine and shit and realize my safe has been fucked with. I open it 100 bars and like $1400; gone. I went off. My keys were so well hidden and my safe was too. I know how thoroughly my mom tosses a spot she thinks drugs are at. Idk how the hell it happened but I ran upstairs confronted my mom and asked her what the fuck she just smiled and slurred I don't know what you're talking about. I went off started screaming and shit. My mom kept trying to avoid talking to me or change the subject. I followed her outside when she went to smoke and she was ignoring me I spun her around to look her in the eye and she started screaming and telling my sisters to call the police because I was trying to kill her. So what do ya know cops get called. Apparently she had a red mark on her back and since she called I got taken in. I fully cooperate thought I was gonna sit in there for a minute since I just caught a slew of possession charges but after the cop talked to me about the environment I grew up in and saw my mom's record he told the magistrate to give me a PR bond. So I get let out and hell's already frozen over at my house. My dad thinks I'm a monster and my sister's do too. Mom wins this sick fucking game she plays with me and now I'm homeless. I just want to wake up from this bad dream. I'm 20 and I don't know what to do. I have no cell phone service no friends in the area at the moment I just don't know what the fuck to do.

I've noticed that when taking an opiate orally I've often had an urge to take a dump shortly afterward. Usually this happens shortly after taking taking it, but before the effects kick in. I usually view it as my window of opportunity to get a BM in before the drugs kick in and my bowels are closed for business for the rest of the day. I know that this seems contradictory since opiates normally clog things up and I'm not sure exactly why this happens, my educated guess would be that your body senses what is coming and ""opens up"" its opioid system to get ready for the new influx of goodies which may cause your intestines (where lots of opioid receptors are) to move around a little and maybe push stuff out. 

I've only noticed this when taking opiates orally, such as pills or pod tea, I've also noticed it with kratom. I've never IV'd before and I haven't sniffed or smoked any opiates in years so I don't really remember if it did it then but I don't remember it happening whenever I sniffed or smoked anything. Plugging obviously makes you feel like you have to take a dump but I think that's for other reasons.

I am living in a sober living house and the risk of using heroin (my doc) or any other opiate was too high. I decided to go get some kratom at a store a few blocks away from my sober living house. When I walked in, I noticed that they had a wide array of chemicals for sell - adrafinil, phenibut, and tianeptine. A quick googling of Tianeptine told me that this would be a much better option than kratom. A buy a gram and I'm out. Eat 500 mg to feel safe, within an hour eat the rest. Nice opiate buzz for sure.

Fast forward, I eat 2 grams at once one day and I'm *fucked*. My decision making abilities are so compromised that I go cop a $20 downtown and get destroyed off of that. Somehow, I don't get caught.

Fast forward, I ended up eating 5 grams over the course of 24 hours one day. 5 grams had me so high that I looked like a zombie, but I felt fine (as usually is the case with opiates). I lost my job because I was so fucked up they thought I was on heroin. Last night I got a 30 day eviction notice from my sober living house. Everyone knew that I was high, but I wasn't pissing hot for anything, so they opted for a 30 day notice instead of a 24 hour notice. 

What am I doing today? Waiting thirty more minutes for the store to open up to go buy some more tianeptine (but not more than a gram).

Just for reference, 5 months after a hefty IV heroin habit:
- 1 gram felt like 20 mg oral Oxy
- 2 grams felt like smoking a $20 of tar
- 5 grams left me homeless and jobless cause I looked like I was shooting heroin

I'm only posting this so when someone else in my position searches for ""tianeptine"" on r/opiates, they won't have to go through what I have. Tread carefully. I don't think Tianeptine is particularly compulsive, but my drug use is for sure. I can't buy 5 grams and only eat 1.

(Miss Heroin)

So now, little man, you've grown tired of grass
LSD, goofballs, cocaine and hash, 
and someone, pretending to be a true friend,
said, ""I'll introduce you to Miss Heroin.""

Well honey, before you start fooling with me, 
just let me inform you of how it will be.

For I will seduce you and make you my slave, 
I've sent men much stronger than you to their graves. 
You think you could never become a disgrace, 
and end up addicted to Poppy seed waste.

So you'll start inhaling me one afternoon, 
you'll take me into your arms very soon. 
And once I've entered deep down in your veins, 
The craving will nearly drive you insane.

You'll swindle your mother and just for a buck.
You'll turn into something vile and corrupt. 
You'll mug and you'll steal for my narcotic charm,
and feel contentment when I'm in your arms.

The day, when you realize the monster you've grown, 
you'll solemnly swear to leave me alone.
If you think you've got that mystical knack, 
then sweetie, just try getting me off your back.

The vomit, the cramps, your gut tied in knots.
The jangling nerves screaming for one more shot. 
The hot chills and cold sweats, withdrawal pains, 
can only be saved by my little white grains.

There's no other way, and there's no need to look, 
for deep down inside you know you are hooked.
You'll desperately run to the pushers and then, 
you'll welcome me back to your arms once again.

And you will return just as I foretold! 
I know that you'll give me your body and soul.
You'll give up your morals, your conscience, your heart.
And you will be mine until, ""Death Do Us Part""

I snuck a few rigs in there and cheeked the opanas and immediately did the whole process(while i could barely move lol) and fell in love with the rush. oh my god was it beautiful. it was like the first time i did opiates feeling. first time i shot up feeling. like oh my god this is the best ive ever felt ever but i know ill never feel it again so i bask in it all i can kind of feeling.  almost od'd cuz when i remembered to take a breath it felt like i hadnt breathed in years haha. but yeah enough with the romancing all that needs to be known is that i didnt stop doing it.  they dont last very long but i could get 4 great highs out of the 10 mg pill they gave me every 4 hours (2.5 mg each shot) and it lasted a good 4 hrs so i stocked up. i wanted to give everyone i knew an oxymorphone IR to shoot up to spread the greatness hahaha.

I was in the hospital a week on that regimen and when it was time to go home I managed to convince the doctors that because I was on such a strong painkiller even for such a short little bit i will go through violent withdrawals and asked to be tapered down off them. They knew my history and my surgeon was afraid of withdrawal effects on my freshly operated abdomen so he agreed and sent me home on a month long taper with 720 mgs of 10 mg IR opanas........  :)  

so my question is are there any long time pill injectors that have had complications? and if so what are some symptoms I should look out for indicating theres a buildup of shit blocking some shit somewhere? I dont use that much pill powder each time and use as much water as i can but i only filter it once with some cig filter.  dont know where to get a micron filter.  my shots are usually clear or have a pink tint(pill color is pink). just any advice or things to look out for or make sure to do would be helpful. like am i guranteed to get (insert fucked up injury here)?

Please save me and everyone all the bullshit about not injecting pills. its been done already, and will happen again, nothing you say is going to change it but someone take one for the team and post about the dangers of pill IV'ing can be known for all the newbies reading this because they need to know, Im just looking for harm reduction i guess, and to share with everyone about how awesomely lucky i got. thanks junkie jesus! 

oh and do i upload a picture to imgur then put it here? want to show proof of these glorious pills that seem to be extinct on the street!

So:

My husband and I have been together for 5 years, married for the last 2, opiate users since day 1. Dope is an important part of our relationship, though we've both sworn that our relationship with each other is more important than our relationship with dope, that we'll quit if we ever prioritize dope over each other, that we'll always share everything evenly etc., that we'll quit immediately if either of us ever begins to act/feel differently... (blah, blah, junkie logic, blah)

but. (of course there's a ""but""): recently, I feel like when it's down to h and me, I always come second. I'm always the one responsible for saying 'no' when another shot would mean another overdraft charge, more and more often I come home from work and my husband has already helped himself (but of course I can't deny him an evening fix -- or several), etc. I hate being the enforcer because (obviously) I, too, just want to get high; I hate being forced into the 'responsible one' role because shouldn't my husband and I be equal players in this shit?, and if he valued me more than dope (as claims to) he'd feel the same way, right?

Anyway, not sure what I'm actually asking here and def not trying to get all Ask Prudie on you; just looking for some solidarity or conversation or anything, really, to keep me from saying something I'd regret or just helping myself to a fuck-you-and-the-world shot. Any good dope relationships out there? Or good stories about dope relationships (good or bad)?

I'm gonna stop rambling now, but thanks in advance, r/opiates, for being here. ~sloppy crying-smile face~",1461125548.0

I have been snorting oxy for a couple of years, 3 of the 4 years of my addiction. After a while it started to lose its effect, I'd still feel normal/good but not euphoric like it once was. I chalked it up to time and tolerance. I tried doing more, but I just got sick. 

Not sure what prompted me to try this but I started taking them orally again and bam, like my first time all over again. Well, with a larger tolerance that is. I know oxy is best consumed orally as far as BA goes and maybe that is it. I have been trying to put good amounts of space between my doses, like 12 to 18 hours if I can manage, right as WDs start to set in and then take my shit and it's like Christmas morning. 

Lastly potentiating with white grapefruit juice and antacids has made an impact on my prolonged use as well, helps me take less I think. Maybe it's all in my fucking head. Anyone else have an issue with a certain ROA?",1461116524.0

Tobacco and opioids seem like a good idea together at the time of arousal, but 24 hours later you're fucked in the head. 

I can't explain why nor how they interact, all I know is that tobacco potentiates opioid-activity and the withdrawals increase in severity - at least for me.

I've made the mistake twice. First time while doing Kratom, second and last time this weekend. I took oxycodone and smoked only 2 cigarettes and for the last three days I've felt like horseshit; lethargy, unmotivation, ""depressive symptoms"", asocial, yawning, stretching, tired, bored.

It had been 7 days since I had last taken oxy and it was just 5mg of the stuff. I've never had an issue with withdrawals or comedowns or anything when I DIDN'T take tobacco.

About 2 hours ago I plugged a good amount of some tar, and I got big feelings of euphoria, it's obviously real h, all of that, but then the euphoria dies off in less than 40 minutes and I redose. 

After redosing (maybe 40-50% of my original hit) I didn't get any feelings of euphoria at all and I just got really tired.

What is the cause of this? Did I hit some ceiling dose or something? Throughout today I've also done a fair amount of u-47700 and maybe like .3 of tar (I have a low-moderate tolerance)

Could the u-4 have made it why my brain sort of 'stopped reacting' to the drugs in my system and stopped getting feelings of euphoria? I've also done mdma several times (6 or 7 times) if this has anything to do with my brain stopping the euphoria only after a short bit.

Tonight I made my typical run however when I get there they started saying narc - narc - narc. At first I was confused, I looked around until I realized that they were talking about me. I was at a loss. I didn't know what to do at that point since it's never happened to me before.


I walked around trying to convince who I could that I was certainly no cop. Just a drug addict trying to get served. I only had 20 bills to my name. One person said that they'd serve me but only if i gave them an extra 10 bucks. I said no deal, I only have 20. They dropped it to 5 extra but I couldn't do it since I knew someone else who would serve me. Only their dope wasn't as good.

I probably should have showed them my track marks but they aren't that bad as I try to take care of them as best I can so that they aren't so noticeable. I'm mad that this happened and was just wondering if anyone else had a similar experience. I plan to go back because I want to resolve this whole I'm a cop bullshit. Any tips or tricks would be plenty appreciated. 


TL;DR - I went to a block that has served me several times. Tonight they said I was a cop. Told them I wasn't they still didn't serve me. What do?

If I'm being totally honest, I love getting high on them, but my favorite thing is that they let me be on my feet and moving around without so much pain.

But I don't tell people about that, because whenever I have told people, everyone is always like ""oh yeah SUUUURE you have chronic pain"" and they just assume I'm faking it to get painkillers. I don't though, I've never had a prescription for the pain that I get, I honestly avoid doctors because I feel like they instantly assume I'm faking it.

I was diagnosed a long time ago with some problem with my spine and my ""pelvic girdle"" whatever that is, but I tend to avoid doctors for a multitude of reasons so, I'll admit, I don't have a proper diagnosis (the doctor that told me about this didn't really specialize in that stuff, he just happened to notice it) for it. 

So when I talk to people about my use, the how, when, why etc. I never mention the fact that without it I can't even stay on my feet for more than like 20 minutes before I start to walk funny. I just hate the judgmental looks and words that I get when I tell people about the pain that I have. 

anyone else feel like this? it's like I'd rather them just think I like getting high than think I'm trying to justify it, but man, if the problems with my back and legs aren't real then I don't know what is, because it is BAD, even when I'm using opis it gets really bad sometimes, but they allow me to live a mostly normal life.",1461201584.0

Where as if I take say 90mg at once and the other 30mg 2 hours later then I actually feel like it was worth it to take it.

I decided to document it, and show everyone the spoils.","I can't believe that some of you live in places where you can't even buy a clean syringe. We have an excellent [needle exchange](http://i.imgur.com/nfuOEBm.jpg) here that is run by volunteers and funded by government money and donations. Its point is simple - reduce harm. No one should be using a needle more than once, ever. I have had to use syringes until the writing was rubbed off of it. It sucks. I mean I didnt HAVE to, I just wasn't aware of the needle exchange.

So I decided to do an ""unboxing"" from my trip today. I choose how much I want when I go, and though they will give some people a hard time, I am friendly and civil so they never give me a hard time. I do give some of my supplies away to anyone who needs, and I let the exchange know this. I am welcome to go as often as I want, and have gotten this amount from them as much as 3 times in one week. Leaving the needle exchange gives you the [telltale red bag](http://i.imgur.com/8lJO7jK.jpg). 

So let's see what goodies I have in the bag today. Because of stock issues they sometimes aren't able to give you everything. There are always syringes though.



**The first thing out of the bag**: [A box of 100 short-tipped syringes](http://i.imgur.com/9yTlO4a.jpg). These are your regular 30 guage, 8mm, 1ml insulin syringes. People have been wanting short tipped syringes for a while but a lot of people complain that these aren't ""sharp enough"". I am so used to longs that I don't use these, but the box comes with 10 bags each containing 10 syringes.

**Next up is**: [A box of 100 long-tipped syringes](http://i.imgur.com/oDOPDWN.jpg). These come individually wrapped and are 28 guage(Thanks /u/treveera), 13mm, 1ml. I prefer these ones. Good for digging deep when you can't find anything near the surface. Most people prefer shorts, and I did too, but now that I am used to these longs I won't use anything else.

**Next**: [Another box of 100 longs!](http://i.imgur.com/r86IE0j.jpg). I wish I had the dope to go through all these rigs today. It will take me about a week per box, If I don't give any away.

***[Here is a shot of those boxes open](http://i.imgur.com/URtGzfB.jpg)***

**Next**: I got [One](http://i.imgur.com/5kIR4rR.jpg), [Two](http://i.imgur.com/vm1rhiv.jpg), [Three](http://i.imgur.com/0UmJ31v.jpg) boxes of alcohol swabs. Individual wrapped, garden-variety square sheets of cotton soaks in alcohol. I am the only person I have seen who uses these. I used them to clean my skin before I inject and to wipe blood off after. I use them on myself and anyone that I hit. I also use them to clean my laptop and any other electronics.

**Next up**: [10 individually-wrapped cooker packages](http://i.imgur.com/3wPN44I.jpg). (Ok so there's only 9. I did a hit before I walked home). These come with a cooker, a handle, a pad to put the cooker on (So you don't get black shit everywhere) and a nice thick cotton to use as a filter. Usually I get 30 or 40 of these, but it was a temp person working today and she was tight with them. She said they were low. It's ok, I don't use them myself, but I do give them away to people who do use them.

**Next**: [3 rubber ties](http://i.imgur.com/rGFlxmW.jpg). They are cheap, about 18 inches in length. They break often and I don't use them all the time. These three will most likely be given away since I have 3 from when I went last week. I always ask for them when I go, because someone is always in need of one.

**Last**: [A safe shooting manual](http://i.imgur.com/epc9vdu.jpg). This is something I don't usually get but I have had trouble finding veins lately. I only have one arm that I can shoot in, so I am looking in the manual for some other safe veins to use.

All in all it was a pretty good haul. Usually they will give out small bags of cotton filters, but they were out today. They have been out the last few times I've gone, but Q-Tips work fine. I could have gotten a staright-shooter crack pipe too, but I don't smoke crack anymore and even if I did, I don't like the straight-shooters. They limit those to one per visit too. They come with the glass tube, a rubber end for your mouth and5 screens. They are all over the place now that they are given out for free.

I can answer any questions you guys might have or take more pictures of anything. 

**Use safe**. New syringes whenever you can and **NEVER use a syringe that someone else used**. Remember a sharp syringe causes the least damage to your veins and surrounding tissue. A clean syringe reduces your risk of blood-borne diseases and by not sharing you don't have to worry about anyone else's shit, just your own.

Cheers and nod on!

Turns out, I didn't prep mine right! You actually have to melt then BURN (light it on fire) the pill to get the good shit out. 

it goes like this: 
1) flatten pill and cut up or dremel
2) place in can bottom (just the bottom, held with pliers cause that bitch gets HOT)
3) cook until goopy with no water in there
4) light pill on fire for a few secs
5) repeat 3&4 until the entire pill bits are black
6) let cool for 1-2 mins then flatten burnt pill to can bottom with finger
7) add ~90 units water and agitate/mix up using finger
8) heat again slightly and scrape brown gunk in can bottom (light film tea colored) 
9) add boiled cotton (large, approx 1/5 size of cig filter but don't use these! boiled cotton is best!
10) draw up into needle-less rig (simply cut it off, not just break the needle off but actually cut the tip off)
11) squirt into needle cap, add micron filter and shoot

I did this with half a 20 and WOW!! The solution draws up dark brown, almost black which is a turnoff but it works. This isn't something I recommend doing at all, certainly not often either but this is what works for me in case anyone else comes across these. 

tldr; method of using E## opanas & 10mg blasted me off for several hours

Also, this post is inherently selfish and I'm aware of that but it's truth","nSo for about 3 years, basically 2012-2014 (whole years) I was with the same guy 

For 2015 we had a long distance going that worked better than I expected 

But then I get dumped from the opposite side of the continent. Opiates helped, sure, but the overwhelming sense of loneliness and isolation would get to me in scary, suicidal, thought cycles that I couldn't break because it stems so much from my physiology and need in life for human touch; it's one of the most imperative survival traits of our species; but now touch is often frowned upon in western society as: weak, invasive of ""bubbles,"" and much of the time can bring up charges if the person is Litigious ....

Anyway. I finally was able to get over my ex because he turned out to be someone super easy to move on from as well as the horrible things he said

So, I put my energy into everything I woulda rather procrastinated on lol. I met a friends friend a couple weeks ago and I had an immediate crush lol, first real one in a very long time

Turns out he got set up by a goddamn snitch bitch in lame city USA. Today I drove him there, in a totally different state, so he could report for first of a 2.5-5 month stay depending on behavior/crowding/court 

We kiiiiinda fell in love though, and I'm kiiiinda devastated. We spent this entire last week together: road trips, Movies, shooting pool, 4/20 hammocking overlooking the mountains smoking bowls. I thought he was not into guys at all. So, I never hit on him or treated him any differently than any ""regular"" overweight friend who id not have sex with in a million years

Anyway, he made the first move on Monday night when we were Getting ready to go to bed simply by taking off his shirt and mine lol, and just cuddled on me very comfortably and more natural feeling than I ever had felt! we fell asleep lol don't worry that's all that night

SOOOOO

I've never had anyone get locked up for more than a drunk take type shit. We have an amazing relationship already , he even ditched everyone this week to be with me as much as he could. I won't go into details of how exactly I know- very personal still

He's setting up me as an approved email person tomorrow and since the only thing he could take was a bible, we decided to do correspondance devotionals/bible study so that he won't lost sight of how bright he shines, and so that I can show him over time that I'm in tips for soooooo many reasons besides him basically being Adonis :)

Anyway. We aren't even really together but I think we both want that rn. But we also aren't interested in whoring around while sleeping together lol. How do I, with guards censoring and me not wanting to ""out"" him to any number of GP if something got read or looked at

HOW DO I REMIND HIM ONCE EVERY WHILE THAT I THINK HIS SOUL IS BEAUTIFUL LIKE A STAR AND I CANT WAIT FOR US TO CUDDLE; but obvi none of those words ha

(Sorry- sleep deprived. Difficult to sleep when I know he may very well have been given a ""bed"" on the floor beneath the bottom bunk....) How do y'all deal with the anxiety, and the fear for his safety? 

Sorry so long. I'm a bit freakin 

EDIT: why is there a need for me *explicitly* to connect the dots for y'all on why I'd post this here? I know dozens of rocket scientists, I grew up with spacemen and astronauts. This isn't Werner Von Braun defeating gravity with the Mercury Gemini and Apollo missions. This is a reader using the smallest bit of context clues to see generally why I posted here, it's not rocket science

In fact I'm p sure inferring unspecified portions of narratives is  4th grade reading comprehension level. Quit hating on me because firstly i truly don't care beyond what I'm typing here (that I'm not responsible for ANYONE else's brain development

I also claimed in the title that it was selfish, apologized multiple times for length with a few examples of why my thoughts are scattered. So hating on me for something I've self admitted beforehand is such a fucking waste of time.

SAME EDIT: don't waste your time by writing a lame worthless response? I think at least 60% of posts on here are fucking garbage and offer insight only into people's nutsack pix (did you miss that one too? Not even old school yet) and their gross abscesses and horror stories of death and suicide and overdose

If you can't appreciate a post where I can't really say many details regarding the opiate circumstances but it's p obvious they're involved in some way. At least I thought it would be obvious to most anyone who can read but most people barely can anyway lol

I waited until I was in a decent amount of agony, and don't think I had precipitated WDs, because I didn't find myself puking or shitting my brains out. However, it didn't seem to help with the cravings or restlessness a tiny bit, even though subs have always been a saving grace for me at that dose.

I know less is more with subs, but as the day passed and the subs didn't seem to be helping, I kept taking more every few hours. At this point, I've taken about 16mg in the past ~8 hours and still wasn't feeling any relief.

Unfortunately, this was when I caved, and stupidly allowed myself to finish off the very small amount of fent I have left. I realize this was a horrible decision for many reasons, but 1) I wanted to finish off what I had so I didn't have more to be tempted with, and 2) I still have a little over a week to get the fent out of my system for an upcoming drug test.

I'm hoping that, since fent has such a short half-life, I can finish it off without needing to wait horribly long to start back up with the suboxone. I'm just worried about blowing through my subs, given that the large amount I took today didn't seem to help.

Any thoughts on why the subs wouldn't have been doing their job? Is my tolerance really high enough that 16mg of subs wouldn't be enough?

I know this isn't particularly interesting, but just figured I'd put my situation out here since it's pretty much the only place where I feel I can talk about it. My plan once I (hopefully) stabilize on the subs is to stay on them and work toward low dose maintenance / getting clean, and I know it's gonna be a shitty road ahead.",1461289634.0

How much of this stuff should I use to be safe? I have a scale. Should I take a few sips, wait to see if I feel anything and then repeat? I've read that it can vary greatly in potency and dying isn't too much my thing.

Also, what is the best way to make this tea? I don't have any lemons, but would pouring a drink with citric acid and lemon juice from concentrate into a jug with the seeds extract the necessary alkaloids, or should I just use warm or cold water?

Anyway, so I'm lookin at my scripts this morning, and I am prescribed Itraconazole, for a fungal infection in my back.  I decided to look up the medication, the curious being that I am, and one of the first things I see is that it has an interaction with METHADONE.  Curious, I researched further, and rxlist provides this information:

Contraindicated:  Never use this combination of drugs because of high risk for dangerous interaction

itraconazole oral and methadone oral

itraconazole oral will increase the level or effect of methadone oral by altering drug metabolism. Both drugs will increase abnormal heart beats (QT interval).

Now there's different classes of drug interactions, and contraindication is the strongest one.  I tried to look further for more info on the interaction, and all I could find was:

itraconazole oral will increase the level or effect of methadone inj by affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Both drugs will increase QT interval

I'm not a scientist by any means.  Any of you scientists out there can explain this shit?  And back to my original thought process, I was thinkin if it potentiates methadone, hopefully/maybe it will potentiate suboxone?

I took 100ccs added MDMA & another drug which is completely slipping my mind. I shot into my vein, however I believe I missed a bit as a big bump immediately formed. The bump went down after a day but the bruising stayed. It's been almost 2 weeks and the bruising is still prevalent however the injection site no longer is bruised, just the area directly around it. I can feel a small bump in my arm but nothing red or visible. If I'm fine right now will I be okay to wait for my doctors appointment in 2 weeks? Or should I go to the ER beforehand? I have slight aches in the arm but it might just be from contact with the bruise. Really odd question but any input is greatly appreciated.",1461261990.0

This time, they didn't fill it all the way, again, and I had no way to get there. I didn't notice until I was getting down to the last couple that the bottle didn't have enough. I can't get there until Monday to see my doc. The clinic is almost 40 miles away and my car is broke down. Anyways,  I've already told them I relapsed, well, sort of. I took two 5mg hydros because I was on my third day with nothing. I told them this today when I called seeing if they would fill it close. Not a control, they said. I have left over methadone from when I was in the pain clinic and am wondering what dose I should take to ward off the wd's? I was on 8mg a day and have been for about a year and a half. The told the VA if I didn't get my meds I would relapse, or at least keep myself well if I have the option. Fucking up a medication like that is plain stupid. Expecting me to make it cold turkey at this dose is insane, not even safe. Again, not trying to get high. I live in a busy part of the pnw, tar is everywhere, good, and cheap. Not t trying to go down that road so I stashed these in case of emergency. So yeah, here I am, on my couch trying to watch South Park, legs kicking, can't sit still, yawns, chills, sweating, only able to nod off for 10-15 minutes at a time, didn't sleep last night at all, even with clonidine, ambien, and gabapentin. 

So yeah, I have these few I squirreled away for this exact occasion. I think worse case scenario going in to the doc Monday I'll get put back on weekly UA's. I've been off pills and dope for a year and a half, never missed a pill count or failed a drug test. Was on monthly fills up until this. So yeah, don't think they are gonna drop the hammer too hard on me. I'm not worried about that now, I just need to survive the weekend, I have a lot of plans I can't ditch out on. Help me guys? Use to be on here a lot back when I was in the game, hoping to get some love back. Can't find jack shit on the Internet for equivalent dosing.

It's always nice when new people show up. Where?  I dunno. But its NOT nice when those new people try and condescend on members of the same fuckng community because those few people mean nothing to me, if anything as you can tell by this post, hate isn't gonna get me to ""shut up"" or whatever. Reminds me of abusive husbands telling wives to shut up cuz their woman brains are too dumb. Or a straight guy telling a gay man to leave somewhere cuz that one straight guy is uncomfortable. Both very Mature moves obviously haha

Under [this table of drugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP2D6#Ligands) that are activated by CYP2D6, codeine and  oxycodone are on the list. I have taken codeine (and oxycodone) several times but never (except once) has it provided any pain relief.

I have only tried oxycodone when it comes to the opioid class and I was wondering if anyone here had any experience with opium and heroin as well and if they could just share their personal experience of the difference between the three. 

I know that heroin and oxycodone are quite similar when it comes to the stimulating effects if I have understood correctly. That's mostly what I enjoy with opioids, the stimulating-relaxing effect. Anywho, I would really appreciate hearing about your experience of these three!",1461501715.0

I also am completely broke because I have no idea where my paycheck is- it was supposed to be mailed but it's been missing. I was freaking out because I can't survive another two weeks with 50 cents in my pocket. A really good friend offered to western union me enough money to make it until I can get my check, even helped me to figure out a plan for making last. We budgeted a certain amount for food, gas, cigarettes, beer, and with enough left that I could get high once today. 

So I was psyched and the first thing I did was go see my dealer. My friend and I have this deal where we'll do the first shot of a new batch while on the phone together, just in case something happens (I haven't gotten around to giving him an emergency contact for me though. So if something does happen there is nothing he could do about it). 

Anyway, I was parked in a church parking lot on the phone with him, doing my shot, when all of a sudden apparently I stop responding to him. So naturally he freaks out, knowing that I had just fallen out and he couldn't do anything about it. 

I woke up 2 hours later with something like 15 missed calls and messages. I called back and was told what happened. I didn't even remember that I hadn't gotten off the phone with him, I thought I had just nodded off after hanging up. 

So obviously I'm feeling really guilty and horrible, he felt like it was his fault for loaning me the money, and just putting him through that made me feel even worse. But I assured him I was fine and that I was going to drive home and call him when I got there to tell him I was okay. 

I set off on my hour long drive home and decide that I'm still not okay to be driving, so I pulled over to the side of someone's driveway to wait a little bit. But the next thing I know, it's an hour later and there is a cop opening my door and shaking me and yelling in my ear to wake me up. Apparently, the woman who lived there saw me passed out, couldn't wake me up, so called the cops to come check on me. 

I got away with telling him that I had a migraine and pulled over to try to nap it off. He believed me but has to call the paramedics to come check,me out to see if I needed medical attention. I refused to go in the ambulance and got away with them not finding out I was on dope. 

By this time, I was supposed to be home like 3 hours ago with the car that I had borrowed. My family was super pissed at me and my friend was also worried again when he kept calling with me not answering because I was out once again and it was an hour past when I said I'd be home. So he obviously thinks I'm dead, once again. 

So that was an interesting day that was full of me scaring the living shit out of my closest friend and making him think that it was his fault to loaning me the money. I feel so guilty about that. 

I had forgotten that I had taken a bunch of xanax earlier that morning and all through last night. So don't mix, guys. 

I don't know why I'm making this post. It isn't an interesting story at all, but I feel fucking horribly about how badly I scared my friend and I needed to write it,out and tell someone, to get it out of my head. ",1461473871.0

Loud music yelling even broke their window kept my son and myself up wile I am wding which was even worse did not knock on the wall not once wanted to but I do not complain about shit. Anyways as a general rule I try to keep noise levels down to a minimum especially after 8pm and before 11am. So yesterday I am playing guitar not extremely loud I do not doubt they could hear it but def was not shaking the walls or anything like that. Anyways I pause for a moment so my son could play and I hear them pounding on the wall like wtf it was like 230pm no reason to be complaining anyways just a rant it pisses me off cause I have headphones on and am playing right now I stop to smoke a cig and can hear them talking through the walls like if your talking that loud yet complain about my guitar playing what jerks I do not like to complain or t o be that guy but next time they are being extra loud I plan to knock on the walls if its it's after 8pm and so relevant I only play when high do not like to play when Im sick. Anywas thanks for leting me vent . Normaly I do not complain about anything just think since they had their party being roudy playing loud music well past the legal noise ordinance time of 8pm and knowing my son was supposed to be in bed by 8 they know I lay him down at that time. AND I HAD every right to say something but did not .for them to litterally pound not knock sounded like they were kicking the damn wall the first time I play guitar louder than normal still not very loud because I am a respectfull junky and also during the noise ordinance times I believe to be between 8am and 8pm it was 230pm they can suck my dope soft dick for real really bothers me . I realy feel like pounding the wall because I should not be able to hear them talking through the wall there is such a thing as inside voices lol sorry for a shitty rant post it actually bothers me enough to where I wanted to let all my junky friends know how pissed off its making me lol I love you all .

I don't judge any one of you people, I myself am a pothead who used to do oxy and dilaudid occasionally. If anything I want to vent my sadness and maybe get some insight on this addiction as I have other friends who are struggling. 

He was my best friend, my only sibling. 22 years old with a girlfriend and social life. He was the cool one, I was the nerdy one. Despite being older than him I can thank my brother for making me friends in high school by him basically forcing me to play football. He made me lift weights, drink protein and run all summer until I was actually decent enough to start for our shitty team. But high school is high school, so despite my cringeworthy level of awkwardness the jersey alone basically landed me my first girlfriend.. all thanks to him. 

Who the fuck would have thought my popular jock-bro of a brother would become a heroin addict of all things? He was supposed to join me in starting a business eventually, mooching off our parents well into adulthood, going to NFL games, getting married and taking our families on vacations together.

  Is it my fault? After all, I introduced him to drugs in the first place. It was pretty tough convincing him to smoke weed but when his cool friends started doing it he gave in. I remember his first time smoking weed in our backyard. He tried the day before but didn't feel it, so this time we loaded up a fat bowl of purp and got ridiculously stoned. We destroyed our fridge and laughed our asses off watching stepbrothers with will ferrell despite knowing all the jokes. I noticed that movie on tv the other day and completely broke down. 

I noticed something was up last October. My brother was running out of money, not unusual because he was a spoiled fuckboy who liked to blow it on nice clothes and electronics. But when he started asking me for money instead of our parents I knew there was a problem at hand. I went to his apartment and his PS4 was gone. So was his iPad. His pupils were pinned. I wouldn't tell our parents if he agreed to get on suboxone and allow me to monitor his finances. 

Several relapses and rehabs later, he is dead. Needless to say my parents are devastated, and it is probable that they will divorce within a year. My mom cries all day, my dad started smoking again. 

I burn an 8th of pot a day to try and fog my mind, but he's never coming back to this world. I sit in his room back home and look at his instagram. I watch his football highlights and text him and hear his voicemail. I am an atheist and don't believe i will ever see my bro again, but hopefully im wrong. He was the coolest guy. ",1461458278.0

I can’t remember what happened, but my last memory is trying to get a glass of water but I blacked out and my father found me unconscious. I don’t know what happened, I think EMT’s got called out. I haven’t asked my dad what happened because I don’t want to know. So I guess ignorance is bliss in this situation. If I don’t know what happened, I can’t overthink it and put myself down about it. I have another flashback of yelling at my parents accusing my Dad of taking my ""stuff"", so now my parents know drugs are involved, but I got out of that conversation before I incriminated myself anymore. The next thing I know, I wake up in bed with the worst WD I've ever experienced. 

The past few days have been terrible. Constant headache, weakness, changes in body temperature, and restless legs. The worst is when you can’t get to sleep after trying for hours. It just left me to my thoughts, and boy, that didn’t help anything… just made me rock back and forth while tossing and turning thinking a new position will magically make me sleep. Fuck the diarrhea and sweats.

I've kept to my bed these last two days and this is the first time I'm able to get online and get back up to momentum. 

This of course has directly affected my work because I had an emergency medical episode happen. It was embarrassing to find out my father had to call my boss to tell him that I was incapacitated and might be rushed to the hospital. 

… is there anything to help me fight this pain that won't go away? 

Maybe my ex knows, maybe she’s the key. I think about her everyday. She was the most beautiful & sincere person I had ever been with. I am going to have to live with what I did to lose her for the rest of my life. We both have gotten worst in our addictions. She only sends me messages asking for pills, and still I miss the ever loving shit out of her... In a way, I guess we both want what we can't have.

Hey throwawayman88, your story really hit home, and I hope you don't mind me using parts of it to tell my story. I can see how we both know there is no easy path with this. Like you said, *”You either commit everything to getting clean or you don't. Don't give up like I did.”*

I want to commit 100% to getting clean. I was able to quit cigarettes, and alcohol, now to quit my Roxy habit will be the true test. It's going to be tough, and far from easy, but I know in the end, I will win and come out strong. I'm doing it for me...and because I don't want to go back to being the same idiot I recently was.

It's just an outsiders experience for the past few days and I have nowhere to share it, but I think you guys will get it. 

I'm not an opiate user but I lurk this community for a few reasons. This is a throwaway, but here's a comment of mine on main that explains - https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1xbj6y/getting_kinda_tired_of_all_the_i_dont_use_opiates/cfa498k

Last year I had surgery and was given a hefty stock of percocet. When my pain was done, I had maybe 10 left. I've taken them for migraines, bad cramps, etc. Once to help me sleep after rolling but later googling told me THAT was a bad idea. Whoops. 

I go in and out of depression on a fairly regular basis - I'm not sure I'm ever really out of it, but I am sometimes passably normal, sometimes I am barely functional. It's untreated. I am terrified of doctors overall and exhausted by the thought of therapy. My thyroid is pretty fucked too (underactive) so that plays into it. 

This past week I've entered a shitty place. It's occurred to me before to make a day pass a little easier or make a night exceptionally chilled out with my leftover pills. I never did. Until this week, when I've done it three days in a row. 

The strangest part is that two of those days, I was surprised when the comeup hit because I'd honestly forgotten that I'd even taken them. Today, right after, I told myself how unnecessary it was and was so surprised that I even did it, but it was already done. 

That said, I'm a little high and sitting I  the 70 degree sunshine in the park and reading, so that's not bad. 

I am positive the first comment is going to be the so wat if I'm a dope feen meme but guys, I promise you, there is no way I even could continue this if I wanted  to. Any person I might use as a connect would rip me a new one, and although I'm pretty tech literate, bitcoin and the dark Web confuse me a little and my boyfriend would fucking kill me if I sent anything to our house. (he already strongly vetoed that plan for the molly we occasionally do) it's a fair thought to have, and if I saw a post like this it would be the first thought I had, but if you knew my life you'd know how laughable the idea is. 

I just, I don't know, it kind of helped me get your world a little bit. It's just been  such a compulsion - I'm like ""hm, that would definitely feel better than how I do now. *swallow*. Jesus, why I do that? It won't happen  again."" and then... 

I did tell a friend of mine, so that it's not some festering secret. Secrecy always makes things more dangerous. 

I've said in other comments that had the circumstances of my life been even slightly different, I'd be one of you. We're made of the same shit, I know that. Who doesn't want some fucking relief?

don't know why she takes it so badly, I wish that she would just stop worrying, and stressing and just worry about herself. But sadly shes not that kind of person. 

Shes gone on antidepressants, and xanax since she first found out I was using/selling drugs less than a year ago. I've witnessed her have panic attacks and randomly start crying before. One time after she found out my dad was cheating on her she asked if I had any drugs she could kill herself with. 

I'm away at college now, so I haven't seen her in a few months, and rarely call. I'm too ashamed too.

How do I tell my mom I'm clean and no longer selling drugs when she finds out basically every time I go back home? how do I let her know I'm OK now so she stops killing herself? How do I let her

now finally I have a question, for which I decided to create a throwaway. I know that there will be no 'correct' answer to this, but I am interested in the opinion you people in this superb sub! so thanks in advance!

I am using H since about 5 yrs now, always ever sniffing it, on and off. there where times where I got pretty hooked and I had to go cold turkey. in the last time, I managed to use once every few weeks, so no wds.

so during the last month, a friend of mine, who is prescribed suboxone (buprenorphine) for opi-addiction maintaince, gifted me some of his pills (yes, they are pills here and no strips. I use them sublingually). I have the great 'gift' that I get pretty high off these, he doesn't. so when he switches to H for some days to get wasted, he does not use the sub and has leftovers. he has to get them from the pharmacy regularly, otherwise he is kicked out of the sub-program.
now time is coming for me to jump off the subs, because his leftovers are getting fewer and I don't wanna risk getting in too deep addicted to the bupe.
I have been using between 2-4mg of sub per day, for the last 4 weeks. today I got myself 2 more pills (2x 8mg, 16mg total) from him to wean myself off. what do you guys think is the best strategy to make this as painless as possible? taking 1mg in the morning has me well (not high) for the whole day, if not also the next. also, after my last dose (however high it may be), how long will the wds last? days? weeks? (of course I am aware of the whole pharmacology behind opiates....)
thanks in advance for your opinions, they are very very appreciated! and excuse my mediocre english writing skills! ;)

hope you guys have a good time, nod on, or get clean, whatever is good for you!



edit: TL; DR: what's the best way to wean off suboxone after having taken approx. 2-4mg daily for 1 month?? I have a total of 16mg left. and how bad are wds gonna be?",1461435484.0

I'm an opiate fan, started young with codeine cough syrup, then a few years later I solid opium hookup for over two years. No adverse effects until I stopped, got sick, suffered through the WD, came out the other side OK. I've mostly avoided recreational use since then, so I consider myself lucky to not have developed a full blown addiction. Been having a series of surgeries lately that got me a script of 10/325 percs, they help with the pain and remind me why I love opiates.

When I'm not injured I'm a daily toker, alcoholic (cut way the hell down, mostly under control) and enjoy Kava fairly often.

But enough about me, I wanted to post and let everyone know that I care about you all as people. You all are facing terrible hardships, just doing what you can to get by day by day. This sub is especially important because it reminds any non-users that happen to see it that you are all human beings deserving of compassion and empathy. I never understood the horrible stigma attached to opiate addicts, I'm sure there's people that have been burned by an addict, but for the most part you're just decent people trying to get by. The ugly stigma is undeserved and helps nothing. Long story short, I care about you all and empathize with you.

I've never made a serious habit beside the daily opium for a couple years, so I don't know what its like to be seriously addicted. I don't want anyone to misunderstand me there, but know that I, a random internet guy, care about you all and I hope you all can find some measure of happiness and contentment in your lives.

I will occasionally go the IV route, but I am blessed to be some freak of nature who really doesn't get high that way without astronomical doses, so I don't ever bother trying to IV. I work 6-7 days a week, and over time, I have mastered my self-control as to where I will make myself take days off from opiate use just so that I won't go through withdrawal in case of a shortage or dope or lack or money or anything else. Sunday is usually a lazy day for me, as it is often my only day off work. I will usually lay up on the couch all day and take naps off and on. I am a two pack a day smoker, but on Sunday I usually won't even go outside to smoke. Also, if I do not already have dope lined up for Sunday I will go all day without taking any.

I had made it to around 9pm without taking anything of any kind today when something came up and I ran an errand and ended up insuffulating 50mg of adderall and having two extra 30mg adds in my possession. Well on my way back home I see a neighbor outside smoking and looking all upset. She had went and got some name brand Opana 20s (E20s) thinking that she was going to be getting one of the generic crushable brands. She is airheaded and didnt even look at the pills til after she bought them. She was so upset that she was almost on the verge of tears. I knew she liked adds so I asked her if she would trade the two Opanas for two of the 30mg adderalls that I had (which cost me nothing). She was happy, I was okay with the situation, so I head to the house. Now I could have sold these for like 25 a piece, and had someone willing to do so, but honestly I was already back home and didn't feel like dealing with the 30min-1hr process that would take. Even though 50 bucks for what cost me nothing would be fucking awesome, at this time of night and with the current semi-drought in this area I would not have been able to find anywhere to turn that same 50 into an adequate dose of anything else.

Also at home I had 3 10mg Percocets that I was given a week or two ago and stashed back for a rainy day or a lazy Sunday. I hadn't taken them yet because I was saving them for the night that I might slip up and end up withdrawing again and need them for the hurt, or until my tolerance got low enough that I could feel 30mg of oxy orally.

Well I know that the oral BA for oxymorphone is horrible (like around 10%, but can be boosted with a fatty meal, alcohol, or other factors) and lately my tolerance for OM has dropped to the point to where I get TOO fucked up from snorting 30mg or more when I used to do 80mg daily. So i decided I would experiment to see if, after eating a fatty meal, swallowing two 20mg Opana ER tablets whole would be a waste. I also chewed and swallowed all 3 percocet 10s at one time, say 15 minutes afterwards just to boot. Neither of these cost me money...and yes, if I sold the combo of the two I could have bought my D.O.C. and for sure gotten a nod, but I had never tried the combo of oral OM (ER) + oral OC (IR) and figured that it was worth a shot. If I don't feel anything, then I know not to try it again. If I do, I know that I can get both of these for next to nothing, and I can choose to stock up my rainy day/lazy Sunday stash with some in the future if the chance arises.

It has been about 20 mins since I dosed...feeling a little warm, that's about all. I'm going to try to keep track of my time and see what, if anything comes about from this, and post the updated results.

I noticed a few years ago that if I took a shot of H on an empty stomach and then ate, even an hour later, I would get much higher. I just found out the same thing with tianeptine. I took a dose like 1.5 hours ago on am empty stomach. I just ate some dinner and while I was eating I even got a rush! I am definitely feeling it much more. 

However, if I eat, and then take something, it doesn't work the same way. It reduces my high if anything... 

Does anybody know why this happens, or have any experience with this? Pretty awesome if you ask me. I usually wait until my stomach is empty to dose some tianeptine and still don't eat, but now I'm going to take some, wait an hour, or just a half, then eat something. weirdness. craziness. 

I'm sure all of you guys know that this happens, or something. I just wanted to see what you guys think

For some reason either I can't handle withdrawals very well or they are very intense but I need tips on how I can get through them.

I feel like all I can do is lie down when I try to quit, can't believe some people say to exercise or go outside during withdrawal it seems impossible.

Harm reduction aside (seriously we are all mostly IVing drugs in this sub save your breath) tell of your favorite combos.  

Myself personally, I have IVed my suboxone/subutex for around 6 years and have found that adding diphenhydramine to my shots give an amazing potentiation and rush.  Call me crazy but my tolerance is at the point where I have gone from 25mg to now around 150-200mg  of diphen plus 2-4mg bupe.  I can honestly say the combo gives a rush that lasts 5 minutes and plateaus for another 10 min or so.  The rush rivals any decent oxy or ""creeper"" dope  shot - obviously bupe and diphen won't give an amazing histamine pins and  needles like morphine/hydromorph/pure dope but aside from that first 10  second pins and needles I would say it is as good or better than other opiates  IV wise.  I say that because the rush lasts so fucking long and the combo will  literally floor you, you melt into the couch.  The 50mg Sleepinal capsules are a must for this as they dont gel up like other benedryl.  I HIGHLY recommend this combo for people on bupe who are looking for a better experience.  I would say if blindfolded, anyone would prefer this rush/high over mostly every opioid.  There was a study done thst showed in double blind studies, addicts could not tell the difference between IV bupe, morphine, and dope.

Anybody else use this combo or others?  Bupe and stimulants IVed are also  amazing, such as 50-100mg adderall.  Each one on their own is nothing  special  but together they give an amazing 10min build up rush that can make you puke.",1461538197.0

This may have been asked before but I can't find the direct answer, will any issues arise if the doctor sees that I am already taking subs? In other words, I'm getting subs from my dealer right now in an attempt to quit on my own and if I go to the doctor tomorrow will he refuse to write me a script if I'm already on subs? I want to be 100% honest with him about what I use, so I will be telling him that I have taken subs and will even probably be on subs when I see him tomorrow. Do you think he'll make me stop taking them and come back in when I'm in full blown withdrawals? A urine test tomorrow will most likely show both H and subs in my system.

Last night I realized that over the weekend I had picked up and I told myself that I would not be using a lot of it over the weekend cause it's my son's birthday party turns eight and this is the first year we've been able to have an actual party with some of his friends. Guess who got so high they fell asleep and don't remember almost the entire party? Yeah it's me. I didn't go back to school because I got started on blues. I missed two of my mothers birthday parties because I was on blues.  I didn't get to see my son graduate kindergarten or move onto second grade because I need to switch H. Now I have another son the light of my life. He's perfect in every single way just like my first son and if I can't straighten out I'm going to miss the first eight years of his life as well. I need to get my shit together. I don't have a crazy habit I've kind of just been using 4 to 6 blues or like two lines of H each day I sniff I don't IV. i've also been really fortunate that almost no one knows about my use. My only real problem is that in real life I suffer from anxiety I've been diagnosed properly in the past as having a panic disorder and was scripted Alazopram as needed in order to cope. Luckily benzo's have never been a real temptation for me so I was always able to manage my script as needed I love her now that I live in a new state I just got healthcare starting May 10 it'll kick in through Obamacare (thanks Obama). As for now I'm going to buy a few bars off of a friend that I met and I'll just be maintaining it like that. I have a few sub strips that I should be able to use in order to kick and I'm probably going to stop posting on this sub.

im always hyper sensitive to drugs and alcohol, he told me to take 2g and it'll completely take away the wd.

Following his directions, i took it and i feel like im on mdma+heroin.

Im so scared this will only prolong the withdrawal, kind of like loperamide does. . .

At first I have to excuse myself for my not perfect english. I am from Germany.

Since a relatively short period I work voluntary in a social services provider for consumers of illegal drugs.
It is a place where the people just can stay and chill. (safe atmosphere, also no police)
We also have very cheap food. Our guests can even take food home with them.
Also very important is, that people can get everything they need to consume as safe as possible. (Syringes, alc-pads, filters, disposable spoons, clean water, special tinfoil, ...)
This is without any costs. If you need 50 Syringes, just ask and you get it.
Two times a week there is a doctor. People also can get naloxone. We have nearly free clothes.

It has such a nice atmosphere. Most people are pretty cool. Normally we just hang out like in normal bars.
If our guests have a problem they can talk to us and we look, what we can do for them (finding a therapy, helping with depts, giving informations about safer use, finding a place to sleep, ...). 
But they don´t have to do it. This is just a offer. You can eat and so on without wanting to change your consumption.
Only consumption is not allowed, because drug consumption rooms aren´t legal where we are. (What is very bad and what we try to change, but stupid politics...).

So thats enough...
I just wanted to ask you - is there something like this where you live?
In my city we have 3 other places like this.

If you are interested feel free to ask what ever you want. :-)",1461608572.0

I was unaware of what opioids even were or that they bind to the same receptors as heroin and such. I think about that first time feeling every single day. 10 mg Hydrocodone gave me the feeling I was lifted into heavenly warmth and cradled in the arms of God. That's the only way I can describe the feeling really. It was just amazing. Long story short I've been hopelessly addicted ever since and now 120 mg Oxycodone barely gives me a buzz (been clean a couple weeks now so it probably would).

Anyway I had a friend who was hit by a car prescribed Vicodin and she told me she hated the feeling and never took more than one. I was amazed. How can everyone not love that feeling?

 I've started doing heroin. Just snort. I first tried heroin las summer. As a drug it really suprised me because here in Spain we don't use much opiates, there is not such a big culture on doing pills like in the US so heroin was my first contact with an opiate. Best thing of my first time trying heroin was the next day waking up, I felt awesome, I can forget that feeling, It was one of the best waking ups in years (I smoke weed).  
  
About a month ago I bought half gram through the DeepWeb, I snorted it with my friends in about 10days and we bought some more. Then I bought another one also to share with my friends, and then another one. I've bought 2,5g in about 2 months. I've shared a lot of it because it's really cheap for me. The thing is, I've been snorting One or two lines every other day. About 0,05g even less each time, I dont really like nodding, I enjoy being awake but chill, It makes my job much more pleasurable.

I've been reading a lot about addiction and drugs and of course I'm aware of Heroin dangers but... I think  I can manage to use a bit for some time. 

I don't have easy access to dope so i can't buy whenever I want, I think that this circunstance could stop a possible habit.

I want to know if I am in danger of going through precipitated withdrawal.

I have experienced precipitated withdrawal a few times;the last one that I went through was surprisingly (at least to me) 15 hours after my last dose of D and it unsurprisingly sucked bad--I would like to avoid P.W. at all costs. I am in a certain situation that has me wondering if I am at risk to go through it again.


###**Severity of habit and tolerance:**
I was doing about 4 - 7 bags daily for around half of a year. I then was doing around 7-21 for 2 and a half years. So I've been doing it for a total of 3 years (without ever going more than 15 hours without it). During the last month, I switched to I.V., but continued to inject the same amount of D that I was sniffing prior. All of the dope was strong and from Camden/Philly.


###**Current curcumstances:**
Two weeks ago I decided to quit. I got through the first 3 days with the help of moderate doses of DXM. I then started taking suboxone, starting with 8mg on day 4. Then I gradually stepped down, getting to 1mg/day by day 7. However, since day 9, I have been taking 2mg on most days (including today). Even with the sub, I was in withdrawal until around day 12.
I took 2 mg at 6am this morning. At 9pm I shot 4 bags and got a moderate high--I believe that some was wasted, though, because of the sub. This was the only opiate (not including sub) that I have used in 2 weeks. I dont want to go back to dope; I want to go back to sub.


###**My question:**
If I take my normal dose of suboxone(2mg) tomorrow morning(24 hours from last sub dose & 9 hours from the dope), will I be at risk for precipitated withdrawal? If so, how long should I wait, the full 24 hours? The effects of opiates for one with suboxone still in their system are said to be shorter-lived than normal circumstances; does this imply that the opiate will leave the system sooner, shortening the time that one must wait before taking the sub?

It is very important to me that I am sure to avoid withdrawal. I am doing construction-type work full-time over the next 3 days. If I am indeed in danger of precipitated withdrawal, then are my only options either to switch back to dope for the week or go through withdrawal?

I also have a general question about this whole PW thing--it makes sense to me that you go into withdrawal because the agonist is quickly taken away, but why does the suboxone not also relieve these withdrawal symptoms and why is it worse than normal withdrawal?


###**My reasoning:**
If it is unclear why I believe that I may not have to worry about P.W., then please let me explain. To my understanding, PW happens because the sub steals the spot in the receptor, ridding them of any full-agonists (and replacing them with the partial-antagonist). You go into withdrawal if your body is used to having these receptors filled with the real thing. Following that logic and the fact that my body is currently not addicted to D, but rather sub, then if the D that I did the night before is thrown off the receptors, then there should be no shock to my system.


###**TLDR:**
If someone is taking suboxone for a few weeks, and then does a real opiate (and the effects aren't blocked) one time, then could he potentially go through precipitated withdrawal if he takes suboxone before the opiate leaves his system?

I tend to go on a 2-3 day binge followed by 1-2 weeks of abstinence. I'm a poly-drug ~~user~~ addict, I use opiates, alcohol, ghb, benzos, weed, and ketamine primarily, and other stuff more sparingly (psychedelics and MDMA).

I primarily use oxycodone (and sometimes oxymorphone). I usually take about 20-30 mg (orally) at once after my abstinence, but can usually take about 40 mg by the 3rd day. Shit is getting a little expensive so I have been increasing my abstinence to 2-3 weeks and buying less so that I can only use for 2 days max.

However, I am going on a road trip with some friends and we are stocking up on our goodies. I want to stock up on opiates, but there is the $$$ issue. 

I know heroin is the cheapest route to go, but what is the best prescription drug to get the most out of for its price? 

And is stepping up to heroin really that big of a step? I would be snorting heroin if I bought it. From my understanding, the main dangers of heroin is that it can be laced with fentanyl which can lead to an OD, and the main danger of opiates in general is combining it with other downers. Am i missing something besides the whole addiction thing?

So i said fuck this I am not riding in the car being screamed at and verbally abused for the whole hour and a half car ride to work. So i said I'm not going with you like this and he said get in the car and i said ""fuck this"".
        Started walking down the road and dipped into my neighbors yard where I had a good look at my house. Waited for him to leave and went back in a laid down. Woke up about 11 watched the entourage movie (2.5 out of 5). Had to find my hidden car key and the had to bike to my car which was only like 20 mins but still when you are hurting it ain't fun. 
     Now this brings me to my point. I stole a check from the old man cause I was pissed at him and those cocaine blues and dope sickness had a hold on me. I haven't ripped one of his checks in like 2 years (when the smack started bringing me down). Ripped it for like 3 hundo. I feel horrible about it cause he drives me to and from work and cooks me dinner and puts a roof over my head and then I do that which is super shitty of me to do.

            I go to cop get a g of girl and a g of boy. I owed my dude 100 bucks too. Get the shit get all high then go to the casino (whole other addiction). Start with 40 dollars lose it in 3 hands. Go do more coke, then decide to go overdraft my acct 80 dollars. Bad idea right? Nope walk out of there with 150 playing blackjack. All out of the g of coke but got all of the boy left. Go get another g of coke and a half g of boy and that leaves me here. Sitting in a mcdonalds typing this about to go do another one in the bathroom. My life is fucked. About to get an early start to work and do a fatty shot of dope when i get there to fall asleep. I texted my dad and told him to bring my boots and a pair of socks and my jeans I hope to god he does. Also i hope he doesn't check his bank acct. or else he def. won't bring my shit to work.

Idk the point of this post, but mainly it was to say that IV cocaine is fucking my shit up pretty good and that everyone who said it would was right. I look like shit haven't eaten in like 2 days just missed a shot in my hand and missed work today, also in the whole with the bank like 130.

1. Methylone - a shitty replacement for mdma obviously.  but anyone who have IVed methylone will know this exact scenario - rigged up around 150mg and then reality warps.  you feel like you are in a clothes tumble dryer and underwater as it gets stronger.  you then cannot move one inch except to hang on to something sturdy in case the ""roll"" destroys the fabric of the universe.  IV methylone is VERRRRY similar to being dropped into the middle of a hard core mdma roll.  someone here described it as the ""hold on for dear life roll"" and thats so accurate its hilarious

2-Hydromorphone/morphine is the best opiate rush hands down.  pins and needles all day.  that golden rush is what i had thought actual hard opiates like heroin were to supposed to feel like

3-RC Benzo (tiz, c-lam, f-pam) in propylene glycol solution may sound dumb to some here, but we inject street drugs so just hear me out.  most of us love benzos and love IVing, so i gave it a shot one time.  hollllly shit it felt like a verrrrry hardcore opiate/barbituate rush - i actually think i prefer it over most any opi rushes.  DONT KNOCK TIL YOU TRY.  people say oh why waste that with its oral bio??  because people are wrong and i know people who prefer this over heroin and I may be one of them

4-Ketamine because it is awesome to surf the galaxy with no bad trip.

5-Buprenorphine + diphenhydramine.  I have to throw this in here because I do it so much and being on sub maintenance gets boring.  Antihistamines and opioids are often in certain formulations of drugs such as Diconal.  With bupe, I use 200-400mg diphen and 2-4mg bupe.  Until you have done this combo you will never know just how good it actually is - many people online and people I now actually prefer this rush over other opioids.  It is a different rush, though, in that the diph hits quick, cold breath back of throat or cough, muscle relaxation and sedation and then the bupe rolls in and takes everything up a notch.  The best past is the rush lasts nearly 20 minutes after plateuing at 10min or so.  Any one who doubts this I urge to look it up online or give it a shot as anyone who doubted it eventually loved it more than other ""better"" opioids.

Theres mine.  Here are bonuses worth mentioning - LSD IV is no diff than oral, 2-cb IV is fucking cool - arm turns into a snake before rig is out, MDA/MDMA IV also are amazing, ambien feels like ketamine IV, 5meomipt was instant OEVs but also like being in a panic attack.  and for sex i guess meth, but MDPV IV was king for that",1461720579.0

I experienced opiate withdrawal for the first time last week and decided I never wanted to be off opiates again.

I did some math, and Heroin seemed affordable, but with the inevitable tolerance build up, I decided that's not in the budget either.

I remembered reading about PST on this sub a while back, so I ordered a 5 pound bag of poppy seeds. It just got here, and I made some tea using just 85 grams of seeds. I drank it an hour ago over the course of 45 minutes, and I'm exactly where I want to be!

That's amazing. At $40 a bag w/shipping, the equivalent of 50mg of Hydrocodone only cost me a buck fifty. And I never need to worry about the law as a plus. I hope to god this never gets banned.

She thinks that if I take a single 20mg oxy I have a chance at dying even though I can easily handle more than 100...

 I tried to explain and say how do you think those people that go to real doctors on pain management get prescribed 4 oxy 30's a day? That would kill a regular person not tolerant to opiates.

So he was pretty out his nut and we where just wondering about town looking in shops etc . No plans on doing anything wrong.

 So we go into a camping shop and he's looking at the jackets n stuff and I go up the back to look at the hiking boots as I'll need a new pair shortly . They didn't have a great range so after a couple of minutes after having a look and talking to the fit shop assistant . I start heading back down the shop to meet my friend . Just as I get to him another shop assistant aproches him and asks what's in his bag as I get closer I can clearly see the muppet has put a fleece in his bag with the tags clearly visible 🙄 Then instead of ignoring me and pretending he didn't know me he gets me involved ! He even opens up the bag abit to show her that the clothes are ""his"" ! Lol seriously WTF ! This is why I don't take Valium !!! And to top it off the woman says ok on you go ???? But to be fair he is a big guy and looks pretty menacing and has a large S shaped scar on his right cheek and a few scars near his temple where he got his head caved in with a golf club . But of course as we exit the shop she's on the walkie talkie which is the high streets security that links most of the shops in the town centre along with the towns CCTV and the police . Then of course after about a minute all the CCTV cameras have spun around and are on us but not before the idiot has darted up an alley and through the fleece up onto a roof thankfully . 
  
  We exit the town centre with the CCTV following us and we go through a block of flats wait a minute or so and double back and cross over the river at the railway line effectively losing the CCTV . We could hear the sirens and watched from the railway bridge as the police where trying to find us . There is only 4 main ways of exiting the town from that direction and the police obviously know this . We could have got away from them if we had crossed the railway line after the bridge as there's away to get to the local collage through the under growth and once your there there is woodland at the back where you can easily escape . But I wasn't doing any of that shit and I didn't mention it to him as its obviously dangerious as your on a live railway line and you can fuck up your clothes and shit . So we keep heading towards the collage but on the public path and of course there was a police car waiting at the under pass. Dip shit tried to run but I just walked straight towards them and he only got about 50 meters and gave up lol .

  So they cuffed us straight away and asked if we had been I said shop . Normally I wouldn't give these fucks a nod in the Sahara but I knew my mate had obviously stole something so had actually committed a crime (common law) and there was no point being difficult with them as it would have served me no purpose and they would have just been dicks to me . So I gave them my name ,date of birth etc or more accurately my consent and let them search me . Didn't have anything on me just my wallet ,some ID ,my mums bank card ,money , my phone which I had turned off so it was locked and encrypted and injecting equipment and no drugs or anything . They then did a PNC check came back no warrants etc and my last 5 charges and total number of charges which was 38 which I was quite surprised about and then he asked the dispatcher if they where mostly trigger offences (drug related) which a lot of them where but I've had a colourful criminal past not all where related to drugs/dishonesty and I hadn't been charged or been in bother for 6 years which he commented on . He asked if I had stolen anything from the shop which I answered no to and told him to check the shops CCTV and gave a brief description of what I did in the shop as I described in paragraph 2 and the officer said if that was the case then I'd be released as soon as possible once the checked out the evidence and asked if I had seen my friend take anything which I answered no which was true and described how the shop assistant had stopped him then let him go and why would she do that if he had stole something. They radioed for another car and I layed down on the grass as we waited and told them I wouldn't be answering any more questions until they reviewed the CCTV and was in a proper interview. My mate also had a poxy warrent out for him from the district court which is the lowest level court in the UK and can only give you a maximum of 60 days in jail or along those lines so he was defenetly not going any where until tommorow morning no matter what happened . 

   The car turns up and we head to the cop shop . I asked the cop that I'd been told that you got 30mg of Valium and 120mg of dyhidracodiene now and if that was true he said it was but if I was telling the truth not to ask to see the doctor as it would hold up my release . So when I saw the desk Sargent I didn't ask for a doctor . Did the usual stuff took my possessions and the desk sargent noticed the bank card wasn't in my name and asked the arresting officer if he would like to follow up on it which I butted in saying aww come on mate that's fly grassing my mum will go of her nut if she knows I've been arrested . He sold the Sargent that it was alright and he didn't want to follow up on it 😊 Good man ! Lol
  They take me to my cell and tell me I'm being strip searched FFS because I had told the desk sargent I had taken drugs just before my arrest . Then as I'm waiting the fucking idiot is shouting about a bag of kit and if I had it !! So that really pissed me off M fucking idiot gets me lifted and all he's bothered about is a bag of kit he's lost which he must have left in the house we where in before heading into town. 

  An hour or so goes by and the desk Sargent is doing his rounds making sure everyone is ok and not dead etc and I ask him when I'm going to be interviewed and if the officers have came back with the CCTV from the shop and he tells me he thinks I'm going to be released soon 😄 Yah ! Happy days ! Though I take it with a pinch of salt ! But sure enough 3 of them come to my cell with my stuff and I get ready go to the charge desk sign a bit of paper that my stay has been alright etc and off I go 😊 I ask if I should wait for my friend but the Sargent says not to bother so yeah fuck him ! Lol 

  I go back to the house we where sitting in and tell the guy there might be a bag some where in his house . So we have a look about but can't find it and it's not around the table we where sitting at eventually we give up and he asked me if I want to go over to the town till he gets something and just as we are leaving I spot the bag right at the front door ! Yah happy days ! We head over into the town so I can get clean tools from the chemist and head back to his and have a charge I sit with him for a couple of hours and head home and watch Game of thrones which I was quite pissed off about missing while I was sitting in my cell . 

  So as I've been writing this guess who turns up at my door yes the fuck nugget him self ! Apparently the police where just chancing their luck as the store had no CCTV which I was unaware of . But he still had the warrent for the district court so that's why he was held and he got a 4 month deffered sentance when he went up this afternoon . Bloddy idiot ! So he's off back into town to score a G which he is going to give me half as a sorry so I Surpose I'll forgive him no harm no foul and it was on,y a couple of hours anyway . So the moral of the story is pick your friends wisely and don't go into stores with them when they are high on Valium as they think they are invisible and can blatantly get away with shit ! If you've made it this far thank you and I hope your nice and high and not WDing happy nods folks ! ",1461692513.0

Now chronic pain patients with years of steady problem free opiate treatment are having the meds they need to function taken from them. Addicts who managed to be functional on pharmaceutical drugs are finding themselves unable to find or afford their DOC. Drug dealers and cartels have realized the mounting desperation of customers and are taking advantage by using fentanyl in bootleg pills. Chronic pain patients left out in the cold are turning to dope in record numbers. (You can only take so much untreated never ending pain before it drives you to suicide or to finding drugs on the street.)


The government has just made things worse all around. More people looking for drugs, driving up the cost of black market pharmaceutical drugs, and creating way more heroin addicts than ever before. 

Way to give the dealers and the cartels tons more money,

Way to put citizens in unlivable situations.

Way to create a problem to try and justify the hysteria and ensure the drug ""war"" cash keeps flowing.

Guess since marijuana is rapidly becoming legal the government needed a new scapegoat drug to demonize and spread lies about. That money and keeping prisons full and open is way more important than helping people not live in pain and helping addicts live more stable lives.",1461688958.0

I haven't seen any posts about this here but wondering what people's thoughts are about this. Essentially Anesthesia Assisted Rapid Opiate Detoxification (also known as AAROD or the Waismann method) is a method that involves detoxing someone from opiates in an extremely rapid manner rather than traditional detox than can take days or weeks. Basically the way it works is that the patient is put under general anesthesia and then flushed with huge amounts of narcan or other antagonists that completely clear the body of all opiates. This obviously will cause enormous amounts of stress and pain which is why they are knocked out during the process. They might also use things like blood pressure stabilizers and seizure medication as well since you are basically condensing withdrawals into a very short period of time. It is pretty intense and almost like surgery in that it requires intense medical supervision. However, the result is that you can be cleared out in about 10-24 hours and a detox that could normally take weeks of agony is shortened to a day or so. Basically you can walk into a clinic with a horrible dependence, then you're knocked out, and when you wake up the next day you are completely clean and have no more withdrawals whatsoever (though there may still be some PAWS). 

The pros are obviously that you can avoid the pain of detox and not have your life interrupted as much. The cons are that it is a little dangerous (though the doctors generally know what they are doing) and it is pretty damn expensive as well. Also some people feel that it is ""cheating"" in a way and that going through the process of withdrawal may be psychologically beneficial in helping one avoid relapse in the future. Obviously this method only covers the physical aspects of addiction and not any of the psychological ones. 

What do you guys think of this? Has anyone done this method before or known people who have? Fear of painful withdrawals is often the biggest deterrence for people to get clean and this way helps people avoid it. Definitely a little freaky but fascinating as well.  

Here are some videos about it:

EDIT: Great answers everyone gave me, plus some online research from credible sources calls heroin use an epidemic. I think this was just an unfair question that really is more of a matter of opinion.",1461857650.0

My life revolved around that chase to get money, find dope routine. It was exciting because I never knew what tomorrow could bring. now I have a connect, I have the money, but I can't sustain relationships. I feel dead inside. The dope numbed me out completely. I know I need to quit, but how? It seems almost irrational considering how easy it is to acquire and how painful and miserable quitting and withdrawing feels. I used to get high, euphoric, now I just very well.......And I feel...nothing. Does anyone have any advice? I have no family left breathing and I only have acquaintances, not friends. My days consist of going to work, copping and staying at home, getting high. I have 5 contacts on my phone, 2 co-workers from my job 2 years ago who I barely know and last spoke to'2 years ago..they probably forgot who I even am. My boss, my house phone and my ex wife who cheated on me who I hate very much. Needless to say, I have no one to turn to, so I turn to you, /r/opiates. 😙

Sorry if the post is long. I ended up in the ER last night because the pain in my back was too intense.

I've eaten 3 already, trying to save the last 3 for tomorrow. I have an appointment tomorrow and hopefully something can get figured out then, and even though I'm feeling great my back is still hurting pretty bad. 

I can't take NSAIDs because allergies. I want to take a Epsom bath but trying to get into the tub is too painful. ER doc told me to avoid stretching or yoga because it can make my back worse. I've tried heat and ice. The only thing that helps is laying in bed playing video games. 

Hopefully my appointment tomorrow will be helpful. I'm even considering breast reduction at this point. I've got too many back problems, tig ol' bitties do not help. I need a good massage too.

In the comments he mentioned suicide pretty seriously. Also a bunch of other things that really made my heart go out to him. Baby on the way, a series of bad decisions etc.

Situations I'm sure a lot of us have been in.

Anyway I told him to PM me and I would western union him a few bucks so he could at least get feeling well, and hopefully the world would seem a little brighter and he could deal with things one problem at a time.

Whether or not this would have made a difference, who knows but I know having a stranger do something nice for me at the right moment is why I am here today.

Regardless he did PM me  and sent me his number, I didn't have any minutes and he really wanted someone to talk to. It felt terrible. I told him a bit of my story and again offered to send him a few bucks, for food or dope or whatever. He really didn't want it and just said he was going to finish his beer and run into a wall.

Anyway, I told him to hang in for a few hrs until my check gets deposited and worst case he could go out with a good buzz, or who knows maybe things would brighten up a bit and he could see about getting some help it sounded like we might have made a bit of progress, but I haven't heard back from him and it's damn near time that I was going to hook him up. My hope is that he passed out and I'll hear from him later.

Anyway this really upset me I was thinking that it would be nice if we had some sort of a support network for people having a rough time and needing to talk to someone or vent or just to know that there is someone out there who gives a shit, as I said just that little gesture can very well save someones life.

If anyone has any ideas, I'd be interested in working on something.

I go up to the trash and it is almost empty and locked, practically had to crawl through the little hole to get to the cigarette box. I finally grab it, and it is empty. I figure it has fallen out and I can't get to it because of the lock.

I go in the store and tell one of the managers that I think my wedding ring accidentally fell into the trash, so she goes out with me and unlocks the trash. I tore through everything, which wasn't much, and can't find it.

I call my dgirl and she says it has to be in there, and the driver tells me it was right at the top, which was a red flag to me because the trash was almost empty and she said it was full. I go back in the store and they say they only collect the trash at nights so there is no way there was a new bag in there.

Long story short, the driver stole that shit. There is no way someone grabbed it in the few minutes before I go there and the trash was empty enough that nobody would see it unless they practically climbed into the trash.

I called the dgirl and she was pissed basically saying that me or the driver was lying. I asked her what I would gain for lying because I offered to pay for the stuff that I didn't even get.

Since that day every Sunday afternoon/morning I am once again met with the same depression-like symptoms. By the time I'm popping another pill I've reached a normal mental state, but why is this? 7 days of succession. Isn't that enough?

My hands were shaking because I had just guzzled a 12-ounce coffee, plus I was in a public bathroom and there were other people in there, so I was nervous that someone would hear me. As I was reaching into my pocket to grab the bill I use to snort and put the bag away, my phone started to slip off my leg, and I quickly grabbed it. In the process, I dropped the stamp into the toilet and lost all the powder on my phone. I sat there looking longingly at it for a few seconds before accepting that it was gone.

That was my last stamp, and I won't be able to get any more until tomorrow afternoon. All things considered, I'm glad I dropped the dope and not my phone, but I'm still pissed at myself for being a clumsy fuck.

Until now I've only been a lurker of r/Opiates and the time has come for me to share a story of my blessing! 

Due to being a poor and hard working guy with responsibilities it has been weeks since I've had the money for any #4.  

Daily I visit one of the city's methadone clinics for my dose to stop me getting sick.  Here it costs HKD$1 for my daily dose, which Google tells me is USD$0.13.  (On a side note which some of you might find interesting is that here  methadone treatment is very accessible.  All one needs to do is walk into any one of the about 20-ish methadone clinics scattered around the territory and ask for it.  If the Dr is on duty, which is most evenings, you are given a short assessment and then admitted to the program at a starting dose of 20-40ml of methadone.  There is essentially no barrier to stop anyone who needs methadone from getting it which is absolutely wonderful.  Many countries perhaps ought to take note of the system here.  It must have a great effect on crime stats! ) 

Today after work I was feeling really quite depressed as my life seems to be in a difficult patch.  I work and work and nothing is quite enough.  What didn't help the situation today either was that yesterday I'd had my methadone at around 10.30am and today it wasn't going to be before 5.30pm that I would be able to make it to the clinic.  Once the 25th hour had passed I was beset with hot, Hot, HOT flushes, icky sweat, stomach knots and the rest.  I was thinking over and over about how I work so much but don't even have enough money for drugs.  Not that #4 is very expensive over here at HKD$150 or USD$20 for a small plastic wrapped ball about the size of a ladies little finger nail. 

So.  Feeling generally unwell I was shuffling down the sidewalk about a block away from the clinic trying to shift my thoughts away from wishing and hoping for some Heroin.  On the ground I saw a squashed white oval shape that looked familiar in the crack between two concrete pavement slabs.  It didn't seem possible though I thought.  My eyes aren't the best and I am quite tall making the packet far away from me and in all honesty it just looked like a little piece of plastic rubbish.  I continued walking.  

At the clinic I presented my one dollar, my ID and received my small cup of 45ml of an unremarkable tasting green methadone solution.  (Over the past month a few of the clinics have moved to a more accurate digital pump dispensing system which pumps an exact amount into a little cup.  Prior to this a person behind the counter would have to pour some out from a jug into a measuring glass and then into the mug. *In Macau the system is perhaps even better.  A person approaches a machine located inside various offices, scans their card and is then automatically dispensed an appropriate dose of methadone.  No human interaction is needed even!) And then I continued on my way. 

Meanwhile I hadn't stopped thinking of the possibility of what I had seen actually being a ball of Gam (gam pronounced as gum, is the Cantonese word for Heroin. By saying to the right person ""Yat goh gam"" and handing over HKD$150 one will be handed a ball of very strong long legged holy fire) and as I made my way back there I slowly began to hope and pray to the Flying Spaghetti God.  I began fiending pretty hard at this point.  My mind quickly obsessed with the thought of having a shot. My desire started getting out of control.  It was definitely unlikely that there was any heroin lying about a busy busy city and I told myself so.  However, I had set myself up for a fall.  Why am I so dumb? I asked myself while concurrently imagining a massive rush. 

I got back to where I had passed by 20 minutes before and where at least 2,000 people had passed by since.  I looked down, holding my breath. I couldn't see anything. Preparing to move on I scanned the area once more, and then I saw it about a metre away. I guess someone scuffed it with their shoe or something in passing.  I picked it up! I squeezed it and sniffed it.  It looked right! Holy crap! Holy freaking Pastafari!  For the first time in over three weeks I finally had the object of my desire.  My feelings were quite extreme and also for the first time in quite some while I started to feel a bit excited too. 

My good luck however was only beginning!  I pocketed the ball of fire in the little mesh pocket of my headphones case and continued making my way home.  I was so very tempted to find a bathroom and rail a few lines but, all things considered, I prefer to ping that shit.  About fourty five minutes later I was walking along the sidewalk approaching my village I spotted a plastic bag with white powder in it sitting on the sidewalk.  This area is a lot more rural and a lot quieter.  I took a look around, seeing no one I picked it up.  The bag was one of those small zip locks that would fit the tip of a finger.  Inside was a good pinch of pearly white powder.  I wiped my finger around the top of the zip lock and touched it to my tongue. I felt the unmistakable numbing of cocaine!  Something that I hear runs to about HKD$4,000 a gram in these parts and is very out of my league.  So much so that I have done it very very rarely.  

With the cocaine in hand I stashed it in my case and continued on my way.  I remembered a few posts in r/Opiates over this past week of people waxing lyrical on the subject of speedballs and posting delicious looking photos and descriptions of the effects and how at the time I had thought that it is something that I would like to try at some point.  Of course I had figured that point would be so very far in the distance.  So very far in fact that I doubted that it might ever come to pass. 

Walking my way home I felt great.  It was good to be alive.  Probably not so good for me to have such up and down responses to drugs but it seems to he how I roll.  

I got home and I was all alone. The family was out and not due back for more than an hour.  The dishes were already done and it was time for me to get my mix on.  I opened up the Heroin and yes, it definitely was Heroin, white and pungent smelling.  I snipped the top of the ziplock baggie off and filled the bag with water from a syringe and mixed the contents around with a toothpick.  Once the water was stewing I took the plunger out and tipped the contents of the Heroin bag into the body, replaced the plunger and sucked the cocaine water up.  With a few shakes the heroin had dissolved into the water and all was ready.  (I feel a bit sorry for all of youse who are only able to get black tar or really impure gritty nasty low quality heroin, here the gear is very water soluble). 

Sitting back on the sofa I found a vein, watched the plume swirl for a second as I emptied the magic elixir into my system.  GODDAMN MOTHERFREAKING EXPLOSION of rush and euphoria ran through me.  I got such a comfortable, spacey and enjoyable high that fell into my lap not only completely unexpectedly but also absolutely free.  It really made my day.  Possibly even my whole month.  

Thank you Junkie Jesus and Junkie Flying Spaghetti Monster, you two are a guys best friend! 

And thank you to all of you on r/Opiates too.  You all make me feel less isolated, entertain me with your anecdotes and keep me informed.  Thank you all.

And did you do the same route of administration - shooting, snorting, or smoking - for each type? For example: you shot #3, #4 and tar or you snorted all three flavors instead.  For those of you who have done all three, which type of heroin was your favorite and why? And the same question is posed to those who have tried all three but did not do the same roa with each. For example: you shot #4 but you smoked #3 and tar instead of shooting. 

So far, I've tried two flavors:


* heroin number four
 
Being on the east coast for most of my heroin career, and with it being the most widely available/abundant, I mainly use heroin #4 - interesting tidbit: it's also commonly known as ""china white""; nicknamed for its white(ish) powder color and China having been the biggest dope manufacturer and importer at the time, during the 70s - I think. Dont quote me on that date :)  obviously now, east coast heroin is imported from all over - Mexico and Afghanistan/Pakistan being the three largest supplies. Anyways, I've been very spoiled living in Philly, since it has one of the largest open-air drug trafficking markets, not only within the East coast, but one of the largest in the world. Combine that with having some of the purest street level dope on the East Coast, and you have yourself one hell of a junkie Mecca. 


* heroin number three

Back in the glory days, when the original Silk Road was at its best, for the very first time in my dopeing career, I was able to get my hands on something different: some *really fucking* pure Afghan #3. Oh my. It was beautiful. It was chunky and curvy and looked like rocks the color of sexy summer sand. At the time, I had never seen anything like it. If it were socially acceptable, and possible through the laws of the universe, and if I were in high school at the time, I would of asked this seductive narcotic to the prom. It would of been magical. But I digress - just a tad :)  anyway, there was this fantastic vender on there who would really hook us up and was remarkably discreet and clever. He claimed his buddy brought it back from the war. I was naive at the time and did not know how to shoot heroin #3 - *I thought* I did; but nope, I was wrong. I treated it like typical eastcoast powder. And not knowing I needed lime juice, it wouldn't mix up properly; therefore, I unknowingly fucked it up the first time I tried to shoot it. Since I obviously didn't get an awesome rush and a great high like everyone was raving about in his reviews, I thought the vender had ripped me off - imagining him using my hard earned money to wipe the tears from his eyes from laughing so hard at *""theeis stooppeeid ameerikeen""*. I don't know why I imagined some ridiculous French and Russian mixed accent with him haha but I did. The vender was super cool and patient and understanding while he explained to me the special mechanics of shooting that specific flavor of dope. I strictly followed each step meticulously with *marvelous* and *phenomenal* results. For having a fairly high tolerance at the time, I amazingly only needed about a pinhead sized dose to get one of the most euphoric rushes and peaceful highs I've ever had. I then immediately proceeded to convert most of the cash I had at the time into bitcoins; which, I then promptly transfered directly into that venders silk road account :)

Overall both types of heroin are fantastic in their own ways. I think I prefer East coast powder though - just for the diversity of being able to snort and shoot with ease and for the sheer simplicity in regards to specifically iving. You cannot snort or shoot #3 directly - it's gotta be prepped first, which can be annoying in the beginning. Although, once the technique is learned, it is wonderfully easy and fun to smoke . 

Unfortunately, I have never had the chance to try any tar. I've always wanted to - I hear the rush is absolutely fucking incredible compared to eastcoast and number three. I've read the intense rush is due to a much larger amount of 6-mam or something like that. Ive always wondered if there's some way to higher the 6-mam content in #3 and 4 and still keep the same contextual powder form.

Sorry for the length of the post - I had just done my last shot right before I began typing this. It originally intended to be a simple question. It kind of grew larger and larger on its own after that haha

So....thoughts anyone? To my original question? Or about my ramble? Both are definitely encouraged!   :)",1461930714.0

I've gotten clean twice over the years, once for 6 months living down in Florida at a rehab / halfway house setup, and the second time on my own with suboxone maintenance. This time around, I finally regained trust and happiness from my family. These past two months of cleanliness were beautiful only because I got to saw my mother smile every day when she saw me, although she never knew how dead I am on the inside. 

Okay, to the relapse story!

Over the months of being clean I saved up a little chunk of change, 500$ ish dollars. I've been experimenting with RC benzos for a little while, and I missed my sub dose for nearly 36 hours when I took a few MG of benzos, and this is what triggered the relapse. To the fun part....

So I wake up, take the benzos, decide I want dope and not suboxone (should have taken my nightly dose before bed), so I call up a dealer and grab a 40 bag. I snort the whole bag before I even make it back to my house. When I walk in, my mother instantly knows, pinned pupils, a little sweaty in the face, and pale. So I get kicked out for the night. I grab my things and head to a cheap motel a few miles away. I then call my dealer (who is more like 80% dealer 20% friend, but hes a piece of shit at times) and he comes through for me with 5 or 6 50 bags of dope, and some sexy ass hookers, and another friend of ours. As soon as he arrives, I rip open 3 50 bags (about 1.5g) and snort it all in one line, and im 6 beers deep and a few benzos in by now. Then one of the girls starts getting a little frisky, and I give her a little dope and take her to the bathroom. She starts blowing me, and snorting lines off my dick, while deep french kissing me with whiskey in her mouth to get us both drunk. I eventually move to one of the beds (my other friend was fucking a girl on the left bed, two beds total) and right before we start to fuck, she wants to put a condom on. I toss her some money and a fat line and tell her Im going in raw but I'll pull out. After about 46 seconds I bust the fattest fucking nut in her pussy and she kinda laughed it off. We did more dope, then I fucked her in the ass and came in her ass (got poopdick, ugh) 

So, that was my relapse, I had a night of unlimited pussy, ass, dope, liquor, cigarettes, weed, ordered pizza for everyone and it was literally a fucking lavish, pornstar celebrity like experience. But now that that is over, Im back at home and I have to move out in the next few days, I'm pleading with my mother to let me stay for 2 more weeks in order to finish college, or else I'll just be homeless and sleep somewhere in the woods on campus or something. So regardless if I get to stay to finish school, I have to leave, and I am penniless. 

I plan to go back to florida and hopefully in the next two weeks Ill save up around 200$, but we all know that if Im about to go to rehab and quit for good, im not gonna wanna go sober. So anyways I guess we'll see what happens.

Moral of the story, yeah man its fun to do bad things, but in the end its not worth the damage you do to your family. I dont care about myself, i treat my body like an amusement park, but I just cant take that look in my mothers eyes. So I have to go. Oh and not to mention I might have fucking triplets on the way the amount of times I popped my nut in those hookers. 

I love u all and if anyone is interested I can update my journey over the next 2 weeks or so. Sorry for the long shit post. ",1461913411.0

I've been wondering about this for a while. I really enjoy reading when I'm high, but if I have a good buzz going - basically, if I'm high enough that I'm at the point where I have to read with one eye closed - then I will inevitably start nodding, and it will take me like half an hour to read a single page. I tried to find ways round this for a while, but have recently found the only method that's proven to consistently work - reading aloud. For some reason, if I read aloud, I won't nod at all. Anyone have any idea why this is? Also, let's post other idiosyncratic behaviours & traits we have while we're high. Another one of mine is that I will eat tons of chocolate - I love chocolate anyway, but when I'm high I will eat obscene amounts of it. It's not like when I used to get the munchies with weed, where I felt really really hungry, it's just so delicious that I can't stop doing it.

Anyways, I started using almost 8 years ago now. It really started with a childhood friend of mine going crazy off a tab of acid (latent schizo I guess) and then really fucking with me while I was on a tab of acid and convincing me I had gone crazy. Actually I'm not sure it was acid, it may have been an RC, because the trip was way more intense than any acid or shrooms I had had previous, and lasted 4 days. Anyways, this trip gave me serious anxiety and other mental health issues. I truly bought into all the Illuminati shit, thought the tv was trying to control me, thought shady groups were watching me, etc. Anyways, at the time I was at NYU and being so mentally ill I couldn't keep up with school, and plus I had a long term and long distance relationship that I couldn't handle keeping long distance anymore, so  I dropped out and went back to my little shithole of a home town in CT.

I started working as a line cook as a casino, and was introduced to oxycontin by my coworkers. Loved it. GF loved it too. Score. Life was fucking awesome.

Oxycontin became harder and harder to find, as did money, and the will to go to work. I would quit for weeks at a time to prove to my friends and myself I wasn't addicted. I met this kid who does heroin, but was currently on the methadone clinic, at a party.

Because he was on the methadone clinic but neither him or his girlfriend drove, he ended up in a position where he was giving me free dope to drive him to the city (capital of CT) to pick up dope. My GF (same GF thru whole story) really wanted to try shooting heroin, and I was curious at this point too. We made an agreement that we will shoot it once, and never do it again, we were doing it too often anyways. We shot it, then we shot it again. And again. Then she od'd (friend gave her CPR, and she ended up ok) and we sat on a couch and cried and promised we'd never do it again, realizing that this was real life and not a game (you lost it). Then we did it again.

Our social circle fairly quickly became heroin addicts in varying stages of addiction, and we quickly descended into the depths of addiction.

Fast forward through the next 6 years of jail, prison, institutions, hospitals, overdoses, deaths of friends, etc.

It's 6 months ago and I've got a condo and a job paying $100,000/year. Still dating the same girl. She's on the clinic, on 100 mg, and yet still somehow gets high off of two bags, though she doesn't need them. I'm bouncing between suboxone doctors, getting prescribed subs I'm selling to buy dope. Life is going ok, I've finally hit a point where I'm miserable, but can more or less afford to be miserable. Don't get me wrong, I'm still not paying non critical bills and still am spending every penny on heroin, but I'm getting paid enough to actually be able to afford to buy enough heroin to sell some and buy some more and get through the week almost without having to do shit like steal.

Then I total my car. Life goes to shit. Because of my job, I'm living on the other side of the state from where I grew up, I don't know anyone but my coworkers, and getting rides to hartford to buy dope is prohibitively expensive. Can't get dope locally. Life quickly begins to fall apart. Stop going to work because I have to spend most of my day on the other side of the state selling dope so that I can get right and go to work.

Tensions with GF (of almost 10 years) are growing. Sex life is non existent because the amounts of dope I am doing are not only killing any desire to have sex, but are keeping me from getting hard and even faking it. GF feels like I don't think she's hot (although she's literally a 9/10, and I'm like a 3/10, and mad dudes is jelly and shit. Though she's got her issues). GF nagging driving me crazy.

I freak out. I quit my job and stop paying rent and tell GF to take a hike and move to NYC, to my grandmothers apartment.

Now I was physically addicted to heroin when I moved, and I had like maybe 1 gram of liquid methadone saved up, so I figured I'd detox myself in NYC.

Detox failed. Got my tax return, ran back to CT and spent 600$ on 3 days worth of dope, just because I was so sick and desperate I didn't care. Not much tax return left. Get into contact with an old friend from rehab who lives in NYC while I try to get on a clinic out here. He took crazy advantage of me, but I didn't care, because at the end of it I walked away with a new connect in NYC.

I got on the clinic, and kept getting high. Started getting high slightly less frequently, because no money.

As of a week ago, I was only getting high like once a week. But last week, I overdosed. In public. I got high in a bathroom and walked out on the street, and several minutes later had a seizure (that's what happens when I OD, I have a seizure. I never do the turn blue stop breathing thing. Just the lose consciousness and seize thing). Anyways, my connect stopped answering the phone after that, I think because the kid who gave me his number told him what happened and he thinks I'm trying to snitch or something, idk. The kid keeps texting me too and asking if I heard from him.

So anyways, I haven't gotten high since that day, exactly a week ago. The way I have done this, mostly, is by smoking weed pretty much continuously. I don't know why, and until like a month ago I hadn't smoked weed regularly since before the bad acid trip at the beginning of the story. Weed would just make me paranoid and super guilty feeling about all the terrible shit I've done. But since I've broke up with my GF and moved out here, weed has been magical. Literally no paranoia, if I even start getting paranoid I remind myself it's just weed, and really what's anyone, including the police, gonna do? I've been to prison, it's not that bad, even if prison was possible as a punishment for getting caught with weed, and it's not, it's really not that scary.

The problem is that when I smoke weed I essentially become useless. It's fucking God's punishment for my misdeeds that I've finally found something on this earth that I can do and while I'm doing it I don't even think about dope (methadone alone doesn't help really, I've failed every attempt at methadone in the past), and yet the substance makes me fatter and lazier than I already am. And I'm pretty fat and lazy. Really fat and lazy. I got a job the other week, went once, called out the next day, and then just never went back or answered the phone for them. That's not normal, and when I was doing dope I was hustling up money everywhere, I became super efficient and effective, now I just don't give a fuck about anything but arizona green tea and salt & sugar.

Now, I do not want to live like this. What I feel like I need is a girl. I need a girl who understands what I have been through, but isn't a junkie herself (if she is a junkie, I'm going to ruin her. I will spend all her money, rob all her friends and family, and then blame her for all of it). I need a girl who can be like ""what do you wanna do tonight?"" and I'm like ""yo lets do dope, just tonight, we got plenty of extra money and it'll be fine just this time. You've got enough will power for both of us. Plus I know you've always wanted to try it."" and she's like ""we're not doing that."" and shuts down the discussion.

Here's the problem. I'm coming out of a long term relationship that I ended but am still pretty fucked up about. I'm broke and too stoned to find a job ATM. I literally can't even take a girl out for coffee because I can't afford coffee. Worst part is I'm pretty ugly, and I'm 25 and balding. I easily look 38. Years of heroin didn't help.

So anyways, here's the question, where can I find a strong willed girl who understands but has never used heroin, is totally ok with me being broke and possibly partially emotionally unavailable. I may relapse and sell all her jewelry. It's exciting. I'm almost like an exotic biker dude except without the exotic or biker. I really feel like I need a girl that wants a fixer upper, but idk where to find one. I'm really bad at approaching random girls and asking them out, especially because I can't ask them out to somewhere because I can't afford that place.

Do I even need a girl? Maybe i just need a friend. Idk. I'm stoned as shit right now. I'm sure you can tell. Fuck you.

TL;DR - If you didn't read all this then fuck off, I don't care what you think.

I has a stroke a few years back. When I woke up I couldn't move / feel anything but my right arm. It took about 3 months before I got any feeling at all and another couple of months of rigorous physical therapy. I'm doing a lot better but have severe nerve damage in both of my feet (can't walk without some good shoes or else it's like I'm constantly stepping on Lego's) and have nerve damage in my left arm / hand. I've got a decent script of perk 10's from my primary but they don't really help after being on them for almost 3 years now. So I have to substitute and end up copping from friends / family to make it manageable.

I know I will be dropped (piss tested) on my 1st visit to pain management. Are they just gonna check to see if I just have the correct drugs in my system or are they gonna be able to tell if I'm taking more than prescribed? If that's the case if I cut back and just take my 3 10's a day for a week or so before will that be enough to get my levels down to a believable amount. I'm really trying to at least get bumped up to 15's or 20's. Anything I should say or bring with me? I already have a laundry list of things where I've been bumped up from hydro 5's at 55 a month to hydro 10's to perk 5's to the (90) perk 10's I've been on for about a year. I just know I need something better to help with the pain. I got records showing them trying hydro's, perks, and even fent patches.

Just don't know how up front I should be and how badly they're gonna scrutinize me (I'm late 20's and white). I would do anything to just get something ER and something IR for breakthrough. I have it my medical records that it's affected my sleep and I just have generally anxiety (which I get k-pins for) because I never know how bad the pain the next day is gonna be.
Would bringing my mom with me to the appointment help since she can vouch that I'm just not my old self and my quality of life is going down as I get feeling back (the feeling I'm getting back is just pain)? I've honestly thought about just having an ""accident"" and getting my right foot cut off but have heard stories about ""phantom pain""...

Any help with people who have been in pain management would be gladly appreciated especially since this whole thing is new to me and just fucking with my anxiety even more.",1461892333.0

It was way easier than I thought it would be to get a prescription. Almost too easy if you ask me. Anyway, the doctor ended up giving me a script for Bunavail, not subs, but which drug it is doesn't really matter for my question. 

In the past when I have used subs, the absolute hardest part for me is waiting long enough to use the subs and then waiting for them to kick in. When I don't have dope, my sleeping mind somehow knows and always wakes me up at 5am in full panic/anxiety mode fiending for a line. Does anyone have any tips/strategies to pass time while waiting long enough to avoid precipitated withdrawals? And additionally, subs always take like 2 hours to actually kick in. During those 2 hours my only thought is ""just call your boy and you'll be out of this anxiety attack in 20 min"". So if you have any proven ways for me to make it through tomorrow morning (will probably be taking the subs around noon) without calling my boy, please let me know.

If I can manage to stay clean for a couple weeks and get my tolerance low, Tramadol causes my personal favorite high of any opiate I've tried. It feels like the best effects of opiates and ecstasy and it lasts 6-9 hours. And there's no come down like there is with dope. Tramadol did give me the worst withdrawal of any opiates or benzos I've had to deal with though so I would only dose 3 or 4 times a week. I feel like Tramadol isn't useless like so many people say.

Well Monday I have to guarantee drug test for probation and considering I have one violation already it's almost guaranteed she'll lock me up. So with that being said I really have no choice but to get on with the detox. I'm good and high now so this all sounds superb in my head I just hope I have the willpower to put forth the plan when it comes time. 
So anyways so far the only real preparation I've gotten ready is some lope. Ativan is also at my disposal but again I have to drug test Monday so idk that it would be a good idea to utilize that. 
So the point of this whole post (which I hope is appropriate for this sub and isn't meant for whatever the opiate recovery one is) is to ask a question to some of the more experienced heroin/opiate users on here who have gotten clean on there own or even the people who are able to go on and off with opiate use as they please. Well my question is in addition to the lope I've purchased what else can I do/use to make it somewhat bearable without using another illicit drug that will show up in my drug test. 
Thanks guy I appreciate any and all feedback. I'm currently enjoying my last day of use with a .8 I purchased earlier today, so I'm pretty good and high and just laying here watching some Netflix and using this vaporizer e-cig thing that was purchased for me that I used twice. It's a huge box with an LCD screen on it. But I regularly smoke Newport 100 menthol and since I've recently picked up this habit I've been smoking them like they're going out of style so in effort to ease up a little bit on them I pulled the vape I got out of the drawer.

So starts my daily drinking, and at the age of 17 I was seen as a chill dude with a hook up for alcohol so I got invited to a lot of parties where I would drink even more, about 6 months of daily drinking later, I started feeling a tingling sensation like pins and needles and I soon realized that if I drank at all, the pins and needles would turn into a burning sensation that was unbearable, even if I hadn't drank whenever I would use my hand the pain would come back and I couldn't handle it longer then 5mins without a break so I went to the doc my sister goes too and told him about my drinking habits and the pain, he told me he won't prescribe any opiates for ""fear of additional addictions"" occurring.

As of now I have been to two docs who pushed me aside giving me 800mg Tylenol, it didn't do shit but I remember I had gotten a script of trammadol for a root canal and it made everything painless and easy but as soon as I said that to the doctor he immediately wrote another 800mg Tylenol script without hesitation and sent me on my way.

I said yea I got a few blues and a few kpins.. he asked what I wanted for em and I said just throw me like 2 points... (ended up being .38... NICE!) Well, he doesn't  do H, he just sells it, so he goes off what his wholeseller tells him as far as quality. Now, idk if his new batch is just fire, or if he pulled my little payment bag out of his uncut stash or what but this shit was fire af!

Well, usually when I'm gettin down, I'll do I lil line before I start getting my shot ready cause I like to do a little line before and after my shot to give my high better legs and to calm myself a little better before trying to hit since I'm still fairly new at hitting myself. This is my ritual tho, even when someone else would hit me, that is just how I roll...  even if I only have a little, I'll do a slightly smaller shot so I can have a bump before. 

So, last night was no different. I got everything out and ready to cook, struck out a normal sized line, normal for me at least, do my line and blam!! I was already feeling decent af. So I'm like ""alright, I need to make this shot a good bit weaker than usual"" and I did. I propably did about 1/3 of what my normal shot would be (at least as far as dope.. same amount of water) and this shit hit me like a ton of bricks!! I was sweating, got nauseated (which passed fairly quick) I was so fucking high lol I was floating on cloud 9000, and the nod was sooo strong but didn't come on for a long time. This was by far my best experience with dope yet... simply amazing. And I wanna add I like NEVER get sick to my stomach from opiates anymore... so many years of eating handfuls of vik, I haven't had nausea from Opi in years.... and it went away so fast it didn't ruin the high at all.

BUT, had it not been for my personal little way of doing shit, had I NOT have done that line first, I probably wouldn't be talking to you folks right now, because I was alone last night... 

P.S. Before anyone says it... I really really don't think it was laced with Fent. Everyone in my dboy's food chain is anti fent. Every one of them think it's totally fucked when dealers cut that shit in without telling ppl. None of them want a life hanging over their heads. I mean obviously anything could happen, but I'd stake everything I own betting there wasn't a trace of fent in this dope. It was either just a really fire batch, or dude shit he hadn't cut yet. He HAD been drinking and smoking all day, so either accidentally or he was just hooking me up and forgot to tell me... me and him were friends before I was a customer so it wouldn't surprise me.. hence me only asking for 2 points and getting almost 4. He also usually has grey rock dope... I posted a pic the other day. This shit was soft, came in clumps with almost no powder, was a beautiful tannish brown color, and had a fairly strong vinegar smell to it. It was just good fucking dope lol

Now, I use the term ""middle"" somewhat lightly as I do consider him a friend as well at this point. However, if either one of us got out of the game I'm sure our relationship would be greatly diminished. Plus, he middles for me so, yeah, he's my middle. Ha ha ha.

ANYWAY.  I'm gonna try and be as vague as I possibly can without causing any confusion just incase someone I know were to randomly stumble upon this (though it's doubtful) and put two and two together. Better to be safe than sorry.

Now, for my story, ha ha. Today, through a series of unforeseen and unfortunate events, I suddenly found myself without a vehicle. This blows for a great number of reasons, but one of them was because I had just worked out a pick up for myself. I'd used the last of my stash this morning and wouldn't be able to make it into the city I cop in (which is a little under an hour and a half away from me) for a couple more days. Making matters about 1,000 times worse was the fact that I have to work literally all weekend (which also happens to be one of the reasons I had to do my pick up today) and I was terrified I would have to go to work dope sick. Going to work dope sick is bad enough as it is, but it's especially bad given my line of work, which requires a ton of energy and a butt-load of perkiness. Anyway, to make a long story short(ish), my middle (who doesn't have a DL, nor a dependable ride) ended up taking a bus downtown into the same city I mentioned earlier, where I had an event I was attending (he lives slightly outside of said city, roughly 10 minutes from downtown) to meet up with me beforehand. We dipped into a stairwell and he hooked me up with enough goods to not only keep me well throughout my work-filled weekend, but enough for me to have some fun tonight as well. What makes all of this even better is that fact that it was all HIS idea!!

Now, he says it's no big deal as it was just a 10 minute ride for him. Plus I've done him some major solids in the past. And he's just a good guy in general that I've established an equally good relationship with. Still, he absolutely did not have to do what he did for me tonight and I will forever be grateful to him for it!

So that, boys and girls, is the story of how my middle became my Fairy Dopemother. Isn't he just the best? Has the FDM paid anyone else a visit recently? ",1462001266.0

(Kinda long but I bolded the most important parts that I'm confused about):

> I see a lot of people speak of Suboxone withdrawal or dependence as if your body has the capacity to sense the specific drug ""Suboxone"". **By this I mean, people who are fully dependent on opiates somehow believe that Suboxone is a whole other dependence or somehow your body develops a special addiction or dependence to Percocet separate from Vicodin separate from Suboxone. That is not at all true.** **When your body is SCREAMING for opiates, it does not care and cannot tell one from the other. The fact that you are having your drug of choice replaced by Sub does not mean that your body knows this.** Very true each drug has different strenghts, half life's, etc. But all of them simply hit the receptors and your body responds in kind. In other words, your body will not develop any sort of special connection or bond to Sub. The bottom line of all of this is your body is dependent on opiates - plain and simple. Any of the various forms present in your system will (should) keep you from going into withdrawals. They each have their own characteristics for getting you high, etc. They all have their dose range, time spent active in the body, etc. They all differ in these respects. However, they are all the same when it comes to stopping the process of you getting sick due to lack of their presence in your system. So long as you have some form of opiate in your bloodstream, in the required dose (according to your body) you will not get sick from withdrawal. 

If this is true, then what is even the point of detox? detox is a three day program usually, and they give you subs, so when you get out, they say your w/d's will be more or less over. But If you go by what this person is saying, that would mean subs don't do anything but prolong the w/d's? and then why are sub w/d's so much longer and more intense, if its technically the same thing as heroin.

If that is all true, detox is literally just a scam. If someone could shed some light, that would be cool cuz now I'm kinda confused on how that shit works, in terms of physical dependence and w/d's.

Often when I snort enough heroin to get itchy, and especially when I snort enough to nod, the effects of heroin will stay in my body for almost 24 hours after I dose! This often means that if I nod at  6PM the day before, I will wake up still high, pinned and itchy as fuck the next morning and go through the whole next day itchy and pinned! Eventually I forget what being sober feels like and I just wish I could go back to baseline faster.


I know this must sound insane to some people that I am complaining about my drugs lasting too long, but I only just stopped nodding after waking up more than 13 hours after my last dose! This is way too long to be so high for me.


The heroin I use is of quite high purity, so is it possible I am snorting too much and it is getting stuck in my nasal-cavity and then slow-releasing? Please advise...


Edit: This typically only happens when I have enough  to get itchy and/or nod. I could avoid this by just not having enough to nod, but then that's no fun... I want to be able to nod and have the effects wear off faster than a whole day...!",1461986648.0

Today was payday, told D-girl to hit me up when she wakes up so that I could stop by on my lunch break to pay back my front and grab some more. She texts me about an hour before my lunch break amd everything is setup.

So I tell her I'm clocking out, stopping by the bank and I'll be there. She says okay. I text her that I'm here and she comes out. She says I got bad news I don't have them yet, she keeps them at a stash crib(which I knew from dealing with her for so long), and the dude at the stashspot hadn't answered or was asleep, can't remember which now. I feel I also need to say that she doesn't use opiates herself she just burns ganj and xannies. And that she has never beat me, or not kept her word. If the bag wasn't right(quality or weight) or the pill count wasn't right she would get me correct right away. I've been one of her favorite customers for years now and she lives mere blocks away from me. Okay back to story....

So she goes on to say that she will have them by the time I get off work and I can leave the money with her or not it doesn't matter. And as stated before never been done wrong and I already had the money all together(front+new order) & I didn't want to seperate it. So I gave her the whole amount. And again she said to just hit her up when I get off work. She made a joke along the lines of, I'm not going to pack up and move overnight(because I left the money with her).

I shot her a text after I got off. No response. I waited 3 hours after I got off and texted again. No response. I waited 4 more hours after the 2nd text, no response. I'm not too stressed because I got to score from the older lady I get pills from but if I knew this I would have just paid back my front and kept the rest of it to put towards my purchase this afternoon or would've had it when my original plug got right.

Sorry for the massive post but I'd like some opinions. Am I beat? Will I get a text tomorrow saying come thru? Or did something happen to her? I reckon I could ride by and see if her car is home because we are neighbors lol. But, I feel creepy doing that. Anybody had this happen before?

I've been lurking in these threads for a while.  I have been shy about posting because I kind of feel like my problems might not be that bad, but they are still problems nonetheless.  Here is a little background info:

I'm an amputee.  I lost my leg when I was 22 due to some severe leg complications.  I swear, the only thing that made being in the hospital for over a year bearable was IV Diluadid and Ativan.  The drugs helped me physically (lots of pain - indescribable) and emotionally (blocking out what was actually happening to me).  But, like all things, there was an end.

I was only home for about 2 weeks when I decided to quit Diluadid and Ativan cold turkey.  At this point I was taking 2 8mg pills and 4mg (I think) of Ativan ever4 4 hours.  Just wanted to FEEL something again and see if I could hack it. 

Fast forward to now, currently, 6 years after I got home from the hospital.  I'm only taking 15mg of Vicodin per day (supposed to take them morning, noon and night but I mostly save all 3 for at night) and I've decided again that I want to stop.  I'm kind of scared because I know I only made it a few months off diluadid because of PAWS (I had severe depression and insomnia) and I am really scared of that happening again. 

Any advice for how I am supposed to go about this?  I'm scared shitless and would rather not involve my doctor just in case 10 years from now the pain is bad and I need to go back to PM again.",1461975927.0

I love this sub, I lurk and read all the time. You are good people in here, very helpful and understanding, rare find.  I created a quick throw away for this post just because my other account has some post history that could theoretically have some identifying info in it.  I keep my addiction a secret, from everyone, at least so far.

So I am a mid 30s male, US based and I was an oxy user (30mg blues) starting at like 1 broken apart throughout the day once\twice a month for fun. That became once a week, then every every weekend and then every day, etc. I think we all know how that goes. So during the course of about a year and a half I got to the point where I was snorting between 3-5 blues at a time as many as 5 times a day. That was obviously a very, very expensive and stressful 1.5 years for me.

So I found a few connects and slowly switched to H. I have been snorting H for the last few months. I keep it under control as best I can, some weeks more than others. I do (at least I believe) about 25% less total opiates weekly\monthly than I did at my worst but it is still way more than zero. I have kept to snorting as my only roa and frankly I, at this point, enjoy the ritual as much as I do the effects.

This whole part of my life started about 2 years ago and continues to today. So that was\is the backstory. I need to stop. I am now ready to stop. I want to stop for me, for my family (who does not know) and for my\our futures. I have managed to keep up with my job that I have had for over a decade where I do well financially which kind of unfortunately enabled me a bit too much these past 2 years. I need to keep doing well at my job and get this behind me, I need to do better at being the best Dad\husband I can be. I have done well but if I am honest with myself I can\will\must do more for them, they are what matters to me and I have let something else take a piece of my attention away from them. I have had a few periods of time (1-2 weeks at a pop max) where I used subs I bought from people instead of oxy\H during this time period. I don't like that route as I feel it has too much a hold and I will be on for life. I also am not a fan of the way I feel on them. Also all the docs who can do subs are full with months long waits around me.

There is a methadone clinic near me. They could get me in next week. I would like some feedback\info about that? Good experiences\bad? Also my key questions are about how they report about you medical history wise? Do they put the fact that I am attending into my hospital records or demand to know my primary care doctor so they can inform them? I also see a shrink (about last 3 years) who prescribes me an SSRI and Vyvanse and Xanax. I don't want to lose that (I can't), I have needed those medicines since before this addiction ever came aorund. I have never told them about this addiction. Will the MMT clinic require me to tell the shrink about this? Can I go to a methadone clinic and keep that fact between only myself and them essentially? I have great health insurance but can\would pay cash if it would help to make that happen. Also I travel 1-2 times per month for work to other states, flying usually. How would I handle getting the methadone on those days? Will they accommodate that and give it to me ahead for a few days or give it in pill form?

Any\all information would be appreciated. Thank you in advance.",1461975054.0
