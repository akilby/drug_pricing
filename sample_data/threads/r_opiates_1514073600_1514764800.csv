Right now, I have 20 Xanax and 20 klonopin to help me get through this. On top of that, I got some fruit, some protein powder, pedialite and ice packs for the hot flashes. 

My question is, what am i missing? What are some things easily available to buy / OTC medication to help? The hardest thing for me is the RLS honestly, as I've tried cold turkey and wanted to kick a fucking hole in the wall.

This is kind of a fucked up topic, but I'm wondering what your thoughts/experiences are: I am of the opinion that opiate use kinda saved my life in a fucked up sort of way. Can anyone else here relate?

**Just want to note that I am in NO way endorsing the use of opiates to treat depression/suicidality.**

    personal story time    

I used to be extremely suicidal/self-destructive. Constant thoughts of killing myself from around age 12-20. Was on a variety of antidepressants, ADHD medication, etc which would work for a few months and then stop. Had several suicide attempts when I was younger. Nothing too dramatic but a few examples are:

- I'd stand on a chair with my head inside a homemade noose, wiggling the chair back and forth for a few hours, trying to work up the nerve to kick it out. 
- Lock myself in a washroom with a liter of vodka, do some bong rips, and start carving up my wrists/arms with a razor blade. Stop when I either fell asleep or got bored.
- Overdose on benzodiazepines and alcohol.

At that point in time I had no desire to keep living but also no real motivator for *not* trying opiates. So I spent a bit of time doing some internet research and decided to cop some Oxy80s. Sniffed 20mgs of it, turned on some Sigur Ros, and by the time the experience was over, I felt I had a reason to live.

And this actually was my reason to live for several years thereafter. Of course I ended up a IV heroin/hydromorphone junkie, but I also managed to put myself through + graduate college, cultivate a group of non-using friends, and get a decent job all while hiding this from people around me. Even ended up getting sober for two years before willfully relapsing.

About a year ago, I texted my dealer to buy some heroin (she had a rare source for good, unadulterated heroin for several months). She told me no problem, but there's one thing, the dope I'm buying has something called carfentanyl in it. At that moment I had a sort of awakening; there was no amount of persuading me, I was not willing to take the risk in buying that shit. Logical follow up to that is I actually valued my life now. Or at least I valued it enough to want to make sure I don't die, because heck, that means no more bangin' Ds.

Got on Suboxone as of that incident a year ago. Cut off all using acquaintances and dealers. Didn't relapse.

Looking back now, I'd argue that whatever suicidality that used to exist in me has been pretty much snuffed out by opiates. In a fucked up sort of way, they saved my life.",1514086948.0

Hey all you handsome & gorgeous people,

I know some people love this time of year. Getting together with family, good food, ect. On the other hand, it also sucks for a lot of people. I'm one of those people that is not a huge fan for many reasons. But that's for another day! I usually have terrible luck with anything/everything. Well not today (or last night!)

I was at work, busting my ass as usual. I'm a waitress and around holidays we get super busy. Well I had this adorable young couple who were super sweet. Their bill was $23.22. And as they handed me the checkbook they said ""Merry Christmas!"" I open it and start crying immediately. It was $100 bill in a cute glittery heart envelope thing. I couldn't believe it seeing as I was hoping for a $5 tip (or anything really)! This past week was kind of a pile a shit for me. Stressing over getting all my bills paid on time, christmas gifts, ect. So this really turned everything around. I hope you all have an amazing holiday, because you deserve it!😁💚

Also last night I got out of work, and got gas at like 2:30am. When I pulled up I noticed what looked like a bunch of money scattered on the ground. But thought, no freaking way not a chance lol I swear on my dogs life, I ended up finding $29 dollars in 1s and 5s scattered all around the gas pump (stripper money lol!) I know $29 doesn't seem like a lot. But it made my night😁😁 Seeing as I suck at life. Plus the extra $100 today was awesome. I always have terrible luck it seems. So moral of the story is, if your a good person, and have good karma coming your way.. It will happen when you least expect it. Thank JJ also, I know he had something to do with the last 2 days. Happy nods fam and Merry Christmas!!😘😘😊



TL;DR- I usually have terrible luck. But I got an awesome $100 tip when 20% was like $5. And I found $29 on the ground at the gas pump last night. So good JJ and karma will hit you when you least expect it (and need it most)😀",1514083676.0

(Male/25yrs.) Patient ID: 74299




**Entry 1**- Tuesday, 3:07 AM

My name is Chip. Short for Charles. I am in rehab. I hate it here. And I simply refuse to write in a diary for the sake of therapy. So, instead, I’ve decided to create what I will call a “tactical journal.”

You see, they don’t actually read this. All I need to do is show them I’ve written *something* every day and I get to keep my cigarette privileges. What these people don’t know is that each morning they’ll be glancing at my escape plans. 

I was coerced into coming here by my mother, who somehow got the doctor to 51-50 me even though I have no psychiatric conditions (other than substance abuse). I guess this is her last ditch attempt at “helping” me. The last thing I remember after being injected with narcan but before nodding back off again is her yelling at me, “YOU’RE RUINING MY LIFE!” 

Well, I admit, that isn’t entirely false.




**Entry 2** - Tuesday, 9:51 PM

The intake process was short and painless, with the seamless efficiency of an industrial meat processing facility. The white coats poked and prodded, got samples of all kinds of bodily fluids, and a cute nurse asked me more questions than I cared to answer about my drug use history.

She asked if I felt like a disappointment. That topic always feels like a gut punch. True criticism stings true. Even if it’s hidden within an innocuous medical questionnaire.

I’m tired. Time to hop in these scratchy sheets and get some shut eye. Need rest. Withdrawals start tomorrow.



**Entry 3** - Wednesday, 7:03 AM

They loaded me up on clonidine and seroquel last night so I was actually able to get some sleep. Woke up to what I thought was the cute nurse bringing me breakfast but turned out to be Elma the old one taking my blood pressure.

The detox ward is on the first floor and consists of 10 rooms with two beds each. Cinder block walls coated in a thick white paint, mismatched tile floors, a thick plastic window that cannot be opened, and perforated ceiling tiles. So, unless I can Shawshank through the wall, or Mission Impossible it out the roof, I’m not escaping through this room.

On another note, I’m happy to find out that they use buprenorphine (suboxone) here. They will induct me tonight after all the heroin is gone from my body and then titrate my dose down over the course of about a week. 

In the meantime, they got me on benzos for anxiety, clonidine for blood pressure, trazodone for sleep, acetaminophen for headaches, robaxin for muscle aches, and an anti-nausea med that I forgot the name of. Most of these will be discontinued by the time I move out of the detox section. The meds don’t compare to a heroin blanket but do provide some comfort.

Tomorrow I get off my blackout period, so I will be able to use the phone. I’m sure Pico Pete will be down to aid and abet my escape. Pico Pete is always down for that kind of shit.



**Entry 4** - Thursday, 4:46 PM

Induction went as well as I’d hoped, although I only feel slightly better. As my body acclimates to the suboxone, I need to stay as active as possible to keep my mind off how awful I feel. Luckily, I was given the opportunity to walk around the grounds today with a staff member, so I jumped on that with the intent of doing some solid recon work while I was out there.

I’ve broken it down into six main points:

1) The entire compound takes up about one residential block, no bigger than a football field 
2) It is surrounded entirely by a cast iron pointed fence about 8 feet high
3) Motion sensing flood lights are positioned about every 20 feet along the fence
4) There is a walking path that follows the entirety of the interior of the gate
5) Two buildings on each end, and a small courtyard in the middle. There is also some sort of greenhouse on the far side, adjacent the courtyard
6) There are cameras mounted on each of the four corners of the fence and two on the main building facing the courtyard

It appears the main building is simply the detox ward on the bottom (where I am) and the dorms upstairs. The upstair level is split in two by the stairwell, creating an east side and a west side. The second building is much smaller, and consists of the kitchen, dinning hall, and offices. Courtyard has a smoking patio, a few sun bleached benches, some outdated exercising equipment, and an inoperable water fountain.



**Entry 5** - Friday, 10:01 PM

Tonight we had what was presumably meatloaf with coleslaw and peas on the side, with enough Sriracha sauce to dissolve a human body.

After dinner, I talked to my mom on the phone for the first time since I got here. She went on and on about how there have been a recent spike in overdoses since I came in. A batch of heroin going around that is giving people severe allergic reactions. And how the police and hospitals can’t keep up. She claims they are running out of narcan, which I don’t know if I believe. I told her not to worry herself, that it’s just sensationalist media doing their shtick.

I failed to mention to her that I’m planning on escaping this hell hole. Cravings are getting stronger. Need to fix that. Been dreaming about it in my sleep.




**Entry 6** - Saturday, 10:30 AM

Currently, I’m experiencing relatively mild withdrawals, E.g. goosebumps, restless legs, apathy, and insomnia. Oh, and the ever-persistent crushing anxiety of course, but that’s a given. All things considered, my body is adjusting to the subs well, and most of the physical symptoms are on their way out. Of course, as they begin to reduce my dosage, some of them will return. 

Still haven't met my roommate yet. His name is Ben apparently. He’s been asleep since I got here. I’m going to guess he’s coming off meth. Feeling pretty jealous of the meth withdrawal right now. I think he must have been a football player because he’s huge and keeps calling out plays in his sleep.



**Entry 7** - Saturday, 1:14 PM

From spending a good deal of time in the hallways, I’ve noticed that when an employee or a delivery guy needs to get in the building the attending staff will grab a set of keys with a teddy bear keychain. It hangs on a hook near the medication window and they use it to open the side gate. I need those keys.

The staff in detox mostly consists of two orderlies, a nurse, a case manager, and a doctor that comes once a day. My case manager is Doug and he is a douchebag. The orderlies and surprisingly laid back and the friendliest ones of the bunch.

I’m starting to find this whole journal thing rather cathartic.



**Entry 8** - Saturday 9:22 PM

Today around dinner time, a girl ran into the dinning hall and started going psychotic. She was out of her fucking mind, and clearly in heavy withdrawal from something. She had no idea what planet she was on when the orderlies were yelling at her to stop clawing at them. She must have bit her tongue or something because blood was flowing from her mouth. It was quite the scene.

Eventually they tackled her ass to the ground and carried her off. Most people didn’t even look up from their food as this was going on. I guess this is normal in here.

I’ve been to a few different rehabs but none like this. There are of course some obvious differences between lockdown and at-will rehabs, like the inability to leave when you want, higher security, and stricter protocols. But then there are some smaller, more nuanced differences.

For example, there are no sharp things anywhere. From the cutlery, to the bathroom counter, to the bed frames, there is nothing with an edge. Everything is specially made with the intent of being suicide proof. Apparently people can get pretty creative when they want to off themselves.

Also, the attitude of staff is slightly different. Less personal attention. Most clients are numbers. I wouldn’t be surprised if their HR department recruits directly from the DMV.

I’ve also noticed that lockdowns seem to have quite polarizing behavioral effects on clients. It seems to go one of two ways for people. You either accept your fate, become a beat dog, lower your head, and do your time. Or you freak the fuck out and rebel at all costs. There doesn’t seem to be a ton of middle ground there. Which is why I need to get out before I’m forced to face that decision.

My legs won’t stop moving and my skin feels like itchy carpet. Time for meds. Tomorrow is a big day, need to make a test run for my escape. So I need sleep.

[holiday shitpost],"I got here, where my family lives, yesterday. First, I met my little 16yo brother who doesn't talk to my mom and waited with him for my dad to pick him up. I'm pretty worried about him. He rather smokes weed than spending time in school and he doesn't even try to keep up an act. It really weirded me out how much he identifies himself with this whole gangster shtick.
He's going to spend the holidays with our dad and his new family. 


Haven't seen my dad in 8 years before yesterday. He never returned my calls, letters or presents after our last big fight 8 yes ago. After I spilled out the words I carefully laid out in my head, saying that we all grow up and hurt people without meaning to, my father only replied that he never hurt anyone. In general, he didn't listen to anything I said, never apologized for leaving or anything. So I left, saying that if he didn't want me in his life he didn't need to pretend to. He's just emotionally incapable... Then we visited my grandfather (my grandparents are separated too). I know that he doesn't think I should have told on my uncle who molested me for the better part of my childhood into my teen years. He told my mother that it shouldn't be a big deal. I couldn't stop thinking about it. Because I did keep my mouth shut for 10 years. And I still don't know if it hasn't been better to keep pretending it never happened. The only thing that came of opening up is that my mother doesn't talk to her little brother, my grandparents being heartbroken about their youngest son and him still not being in jail. Even though I had to give my testimony twice to the police. 



Didn't take any dope with me and went on a speedball binge before coming here. So I'm kind of sensitive atm anyways. I wish I had an intact family. And I wish I had something to knock myself out. At least I'm good with my mother and my 2 little sisters. Ain't much. but there are people who have less, I know. Still, when I see how other families come together with all the uncles, aunts and cousins and how they just stick together as a family, such an envy comes up in me. Envy is a useless sentiment and I'd rather replace it with being grateful for what I do have, but right now I feel like a little girl, aching for a drama free home. But with my family there's drama around every corner. My mother is sick and will die eventually before her time and I'm a fucking heroin addict.

Past two weeks, my car has been broken into. The first time, they emptied my glove box, threw everything on the floor. I keep nothing in my car, but they didn't even take my spare change? And they didn't try to hide the break in either. Left the contents all over the floor, the seat reclined all the way back????, And all the doors ajar. 

Second time was broad daylight. Did I mention I love adjacent to the police station and all the cops also park in my parking area?? This time they just left all the doors wide open, assuming because I had nothing to steal. 

Now, before the obvious is asked, no I don't lock my car doors. A broken window with a deductible would cost me more than whatever they could steal from me. Which is nothing because I don't leave shit in my car. I'm not worried about the contents in my car or even the car itself, so....

Suboxone, MMT, AA, work for some.
Severe addiction and especially with growing problem in US. Life expectancy rate hasn't dropped in one year since 93 aids problem, hasn't dropped two consecutive years since 60s.

If they want to help, HAT. All studies show. Only side effects from long term heroin use, minor constipation, dependence, no nuero issues. Overdose, impurities in drug, no money, etc etc all a function of an illegal system that forces people to go to black market. If HAT was a reality like in Switzerland , Netherlands, UK, Belgium etc lives would be saved and people would could contribute to society. We live with a government that treats people like scum instead of humans.

Check out the PDF. People have asked me what help I'd seek in a free country. Here is the answer this isn't about getting high this is about being around doctors and humans that understand the addict brain and HELP not HATE.

Wish there was a way to get funding and trials started and federal law changed or many more will die. AA, subs, MMT doesn't work for me I know this will and would help me be a productive member of society. I wonder how visas work and they let US Citizens in. I've travelled to Europe but not for something like this, please read short PDF.

I hate Xanax, but almost everyone I have ever known loves them. Most of them aren't huge bar babies, but they still love them some Xanax. I have known people to take them with opiates, and I hate it. It's super dangerous for one, and I think it ruins the opiate. All the positive energy that opiates give you are totally ruined by Xanax, and you just end up passing out and doing nothing. I have seen Xanax turn some close friends into absolute drooling idiots that steal more brazenly than any junkie I have ever known. I feel like Xanax destroys way more lives in way worse ways than any other substance I have seen people addicted to, makes them much less functional as well. With opiates it is possible to behave normally and not appear high (unless you start nodding in front of people), but Xanax just makes people into dumb, blacked out, drooling, mumbling fools that can't be trusted to behave with any restraint. I have had them before, but I just can't stand them, they make me feel so slow and stupid. They ruin good opiates. Am I the only one here that feels this way?

I've been taking at least 30mg hydrocodone (norco) for back pain and an all-over-my-body muscle pain that no doctor can diagnose.  My morning ritual was to take 15-20mg in the morning, then 10-20 more during the day.  48 hours ago I decided to just stop.  The back pain is a 7, the muscle pain is a 9, but I wanted to see if I could do without it.  Just taking massive amounts of Advil now.

In the last 48 hours, I have wanted to choke multiple people.  Dropping my son off at school, I almost punched another parent who decided to stop in the middle of the fuckin street to drop their kid off, causing me and many other people to almost rear end him.

Then I had to go to a government office yesterday to file some standard paperwork.  After spending 45 minutes going from window to window, the last station tells me ""oh, we can't take this, you'll have to call this number and get it corrected.  Sorry.""  WTF bitch, the 6 other minions that looked over my paperwork couldn't have told me that?  I wanted to choke her out.  I'm not normally that violent.  I don't know if it is the lack of Norco or that I don't see people this stupid who have lived past 3 years old.  BTW, I now have to spend about 2 hours redoing paperwork, do a few other steps that will take me another 2 hours, and pay about $100.  All because another government agency messed up my paperwork.  FUCK!

My son had his last day of 5th grade yesterday (before Christmas break).  I told him ""don't forget your math book so you can study over the break"".  I went over this with him yesterday morning.  Told him to put it in his backpack when he gets to school.  The little shit forgets it.  FUCK!

Now I am off to the mall for a few last gifts for Christmas.  I'm hoping I don't run someone over, three times.  

Anyone else experience this?  I remember when I took a 10mg Norco, I would be happier than normal for a few hours.  I'm not on any other prescription or illicit drugs.  I am so wanting to take 20mg of Norco, an Ativan, and drink a bottle of Fireball and just tune out.  ",1514047099.0

Past few months ive been using 3-4 days a month.  Still the same tolerance.  Even using xanax doesnt seem to help. ill normally take a couple bars with my normal dose (I have an extremely high tolerance and can eat like 20 bars and not even black out.)

Its been exactly 30days sober for me. For those who do not know ... I have major chronic pain problems including chronic pancreatitis, a metal plate in my neck, and fibromyalgia.

I accidentally got off the opiates exactly 30 days ago when I ran out of my script and money on a weekend. It started with a make it till Monday attitude and snowballed from there into today where I am 30 days now. 

I went through 10 days of withdrawals after coming off a 60mg average daily habit of oxycodone. Although I could easily tolerate 120mgs in a day if I wanted to. 

I currently live in a daily 4-7 pain score but i rather do that now than ever go through 10 full days of withdrawal symptoms. Maybe because its fresh in my mind but I hope to never forget how awful those 10 days were.

Love,

And was able to support my habit while keeping it in check and making sure i didnt fall behind financially. 

3 weeks ago it all came crumbling. And boy when it rains it fucking POURS. 

I was a delivery driver for papa johns. Was the lead driver with the most hours working 6 days a week. One night i was out on a delivery. At a stop light. Light turns green. One second i had a great car. One second later the car was a crumbled totalled mess. Some asswipe decided he didnt want to stop at the red and tboned the fuck out of me. Bye bye car. Bye bye job. Bye bye money. Im still waiting on the insurance but the problem is the reverse equity on the car. Sure, the insurance pays the value of the car...the shitty part is i was upside down a few grand. Thankfully i have gap insurance as well...but all that does is pay the difference so your loan is fully paid. That still leaves me with no ride. And no job. Not wanting to deal with WD's i worked it out with my boss. He brought me on as a manager. This lasted for 2 weeks. And then he fired me. Before the accident my schedule before was 4pm-1am. Id stay up till about 5-6am...wake up around 3 and go to work. During the 6ish years i was with the company i never once no called no showed. I had been late once or twice but nothing horrible. Not a single write up. I ended up with a morning shift and accidentally overslept. I was scheduled to open at 10... woke up at 11. Looked at my phone and saw 5 texts all from my boss. They went something like this. 

10:15 ""Where are you?""
10:17 ""Why arent you at work""
10:17 ""im not dealing with this past today if you dont get to work youre gone""
10:18 ""you know what youre gone. Dont bother. Bring your key ill have your check monday""

I honestpy cpuldnt believe it. So much so that i WALKED all the way to work with the key thinking that id still have a job if i showed up. But nope. He actually fired me. Idk if he was having a bad day or what but...idk. i just feel like a piece of shit now. Its just shit because people think all this bad shit is happening to me because im an addict and its so not fucking fair. I want to scream in their faces about how fucking hard i busted my ass for thr last 10 years to make it work. With no help from a god damn single person. And now everyone wants to come in point fingers and judge me. And just more icing on the cake...my aunt found she has stage 3 lung cancer. Gave her 2 months to live. And my grandpa is in the final throahs of dementia. So yea. Merry xmas.

Im going to rehab tuesday because i cant deal with going CT when my life is as fucked up as it is...

I have run out of the Codeine I brought (from my OTC country).

I have a /shitload/ of Bromazepam, alprazolam, tetrazepam and hydroxyzine over here, which provide very nice, mildly euphoric indulgences but I am still buzzing for some more opioid goodness.

I have around 30mg~ of morphine I plan to boof rectally (searching for a method, will probably buy an oral syringe).

**But** I also have an abundance of tramadol.

The (**Potential**) Issue: I am taking Zoloft (Sertraline) as part of my anxiety treatment. Given I get high from Codeine and low ish doses of Morphine could I pop like 75mg of tramadol, having skipped my sertraline dose for today and have a good time? Sertralije has a 25 hour total elimination time, so i will have no SSRI in my plasma, granted SSRIs raise the basal serotonergic environment but a reasonable (75-100mg dose) of Tramadol would likely result in an inconsequential serotonergic rise given the lack of SSRI. Furthermore given I metabolise Codeine splendidly and Tramadol utilises the same pathway (to the more potent and more typical o-dsmt) I believe I could achieve a solid high. Maybe supplement with a bit of the Morphine.

I have read plenty of accounts saying the combo is perfectly fine and accounts saying it isn't, so I presume a moderate amount would be fine?

I've been using on and off IV for 3 years now.  

I lost my best friend to an OD about 6 months ago while I was detoxing after my girl called my folks. He was the first person I knew who fucked with H and he gave me my first rig. I've lost 3 years to this shit but for some reason all I wanna do is get loaded. Ive been to inpatient and outpatient aswell as sub matinence which I really think was more effective than Vivitrol. I even lived in a halfway house for 6 months. 

While there's a lot of benefits to being sober I'm constantly dealing with cravings and generally just feel depressed and anxious all the time. I have everything I could want right now, a nice place to live, a really good job in my field of study, a girlfriend and my family trusts me again. Even with all that I still just want to throw it away. I'm basically just doing this to appease my family and not for myself. They'll know if I skip my shot since the clinic is in a very small town and my aunts a drug counselor, so she knows the doctor. I've even thought about getting the naloxone implant in replacement of the Vivitrol injection and then having it secretly cut out.

I've been tempted to ask to my doctor to get back on subs but I'm not sure he would let me since I'm opiate free. I just don't know what to do, Vivitrol isn't helping with cravings. I'm just wasting everyone's time. All I hear is how good I look and how proud everyone is of me but deep down all I wanna do is get fucken high. I know I'm not done using so why delay the inevitable? If anything having my receptors blocked makes me think about using even more. I don't see how I'll ever transition off of Vivitrol and live a normal life.

I recently deleted my last account to get away from it all - because I'm the type of person that finds temptation rather than strength in seeing what everyone else is doing - but I came back because I've been thinking a lot over the last week and realized that we can do it.  Whether that be stay sober for good, stay sober long enough to get things that have to be done done, or just stay sober long enough that it doesn't ruin relationships with our friends who also use - we can do it.


I've run into a ton of caring, intelligent, and unique people on here who have done so much more for me, a random internet stranger, far more than anyone in any other online community, not to mention most people irl, has ever done.  We're all good people, no matter what we've done at some point or another. And anyone who is reading this post is lucky enough to have at least one more day ahead of them to make things right, whatever that may mean to you.


Anyway, I'm *a few* drinks in now, because lord knows I can't be sober for good, but after making it through acute wds I'm gonna try to stick to alcohol and weed from here forward, two things that I have been able to regulate much better than opiates throughout my life.  Don't get me wrong, am I gonna never feel the pure bliss that we all love ever again? I doubt it.  But I am resolute in saying that in 2018 I am no longer going to push my luck by putting myself into situations that I have no control over, because I fucking hate that and I've realized that over the past while I've been doing it to myself.


I know I didn't have much of a cohesive point here but I just wanted to share my thoughts and let you all know that I'm thinking about you on this Christmas Eve, and although I'm usually not the religious type, I'll be saying a prayer for all of us tonight.

**Entry 16** - Wednesday, 6:43 PM

Apparently the cook didn’t show up to work today, so someone from staff made us mac-and-cheese with fruit cups on the side for dinner. It was actually quite an upgrade, so I wasn’t complaining.

At meals, Ben and I usually sit with a younger kid, about 18 years old, that goes by “Spooner,” not sure what his real name is. Skinny, pale, nerdy type. Dude is straight up a chemistry genius. He manufactures designer drugs in his mom’s basement. He’s like a drug addict savant.

But once he got hooked on his own fentanyl the game was over for him. Started selling more and more on the darknet to fund his habit. Made good money up until recently. He claims that almost overnight a new fentanyl analogue out of eastern europe has flooded the market and he has yet to be able to reproduce this specific variation in his lab, and no one wants his old stuff. 

At one point, he thought he had it right and dosed his little sister’s pet hamster to test it. It ended up freaking out and started eating itself. I guess killing his sister’s hamster was the last straw and his parents shipped him off to rehab.



**Entry 17** - Thursday, 8:55 AM 

Today is last day on subs! I’m a little scared to be honest. There are times when I’m all about sobriety and then there are times when I just want to get high. Right now I’m feeling good about staying clean but we’ll see how I feel tonight.

Classes are still cancelled. Only time I’m out of my room is for meals. The halls seem to be getting emptier, almost no staff around. Escape planning has been on somewhat of a hiatus, as am actually starting to enjoy myself here a little bit. But I believe my window of opportunity has presented itself with the current lack of staff situation. My recon work has been over for a few days now, and I think I came up with a plan of escape last night. 



**Entry 18** - Thursday, 7:23 PM

I’ve been trying to find Chloe in the meal hall. I really want to get her number before I leave. But because I only know her by her voice it’s been difficult. 

About halfway through dinner we heard sirens right outside, and a lot of commotion from the section 8 housing across the street. Been hearing more and more of that the past couple days. I think that’s why they have two more security guards and one more orderlie on duty instead of just the usual guys today. Still less of the treatment staff though. 

Tried to call Mom after dinner but she didn't answer again, starting to get a little worried about that. It’s not like her. Going to head to the room and see if Chloe is back yet.



**Entry 19** - Friday, 2:04 AM

Waited up next to the air vent until 2 AM but she never responded. Hope she's alright. Going to try and get some sleep now. Also, feeling pretty good for my first day off subs. Spooner says the sickness doesn't really start until a few days after you stop, due to its long half-life. So I'm not out of the woods just yet.

More importantly, tomorrow is the day. Finally going to go ahead with my plan. Everything is in place. It’s now or never.



**Entry 20** - Friday, 7:05 AM

So, I woke up this morning to the clicking and buzzing of the intercom system at six in the morning. After a minute of the white noise, a voice that sounded familiar boomed over the PA. 

I can still hear it clearly in my head:

*“Good morning residents. Please note, that all private sessions and group classes remain canceled indefinitely. Please remain in your rooms until further notice. Do not leave under any circumstances. Meals will be brought to you directly. That is all.”*

Well, that announcement confirmed my belief that the tension I’ve been feeling over the past couple days is real. Something is wrong. I don’t know why they are being so cryptic about it. The uneasy feeling in the pit of my stomach doesn’t help much. But that part is probably more just a symptom of being nervous about my escape tonight.



**Entry 21** - Friday, 7:46 AM

I wanted to check on Chloe, ask her what she thought about the announcement. So, I put my head up the vent, but before I could say anything I heard a soft whimpering coming from the other side.

I cautiously called out her name and the whimpering stopped. I heard her sniffle her nose, and she finally started talking. It almost broke my heart to hear her voice like that--meek and trembling. She was clearly shaken, and I can’t fucking believe what she told me. It makes my blood boil even thinking about it.

Turns out, last night when she was returning to her room from dinner, two orderlies, case manager Doug, and the head physician were in her room, waiting for her. When she opened the door and walked in, they subdued her against her will and took her to an office out past the courtyard.

They strapped her down to the bed and questioned her for over an hour. The doctor claimed she has been acting strange and not eating enough. He accused her of sneaking drugs into the facility and was trying to force a confession out of her. He kept asking her basic math questions for some odd reason.

They ended up drug testing her, taking her blood, urine, and saliva. It wasn’t until the fifth test came back clean that they finally gave up. They escorted her back to her room and let her know that she’s going to be transferred to a different facility in the morning.

And that was it. They locked the door, from the outside, and left her in her room.

I wanted to sit there and keep her company, try to comfort her, but she wouldn't let me. So I sat there by the vent until I heard her snores and then got up in bed and started writing.



**Entry 22** - Friday, 12:37 PM

It’s well past noon now, and no breakfast or lunch has been brought to us now. I seriously hope whatever is going on doesn’t fuck up my plans. All I’ve been doing is pacing around the room. 

Thankfully, it sounds like Chloe is still sleeping soundly. 

It’s been quiet on this end, but I can hear noises from the detox ward. Like doors slamming and sounds of loud objects being moved around maybe? But it’s absolutely silent on the west end of the upper floor, which is somehow more worrisome. That side should be packed like a meat locker. It was completely full when I moved out of detox, which is why on I’m on the east side. As far as I know, Chloe and I are the only ones over here. And although our rooms share a wall, they are back-to-back, so we don't share the same hallway. Which means I cannot go check on her. 

A few minutes ago I tried to go out to the hallway to look around but my door was locked from the outside. That did not help settle my nerves.

What kind of fucking bunk ass rehab is this? This has got to be illegal, abuse or something. I mean, I have heard stories about shitty rehabs but I didn't know they could fucking lock you in your room and starve you. 



**Entry 23** - Friday, 12:55 PM

Someone finally came to the door. Very hard to write as I can’t stop my hands from shaking. The person at the door kept knocking and trying the handle. I kept yelling that it’s locked from the outside. I took a peek under the door and saw a familiar set of worn-out converse shoes. I could tell it was Joey. 

He finally got the door open. It was Joey, but not all of Joey. His right arm was dangling by a tendon at the elbow. I immediately puked all over the door. I think he was in a state of shock because he couldn’t speak. He just kept moaning with a guttural noise and blowing air from his mouth, like he was lifting heavy weights.

I kept trying to ask him what was going on and yelling at him to run to the nurse’s office. I went out in the hallway to take him there myself, but he grabbed me by the neck and started clawing at my throat. Most of his fingers on his left hand had been scraped down to the middle knuckle and all that remained were bloody nubs covered in splinters and dirt. 



It seemed like the fucking idiot was trying to bite me. I could barely move, I was frozen. He looked horrifying. His pupils were dilated to the point that his eyes were nearly all black. His skin was ghostly pale with goosebumps all over like rough sandpaper, all of the hair on his body was standing straight up. 

I tried to throw him off me but he was drenched in sweat and I couldn’t get a good grip on him. I finally was able to kick out his feet and I dove back into the room. Before he could get into the room I closed the door and shoved my dresser over, holding it shut. 

I have been yelling for help but no one has come. Chloe is awake now. I don’t know what else to do, the only thing that is helping me calm down is writing in this stupid journal.

I can still hear him out there fiddling with the door handle. It sounds like there might be another person out there with him now. I don’t know if he is in some sort of psychosis or what but I’m not going to stick around to find out.

I’ve had enough. I’m going to get Chloe and we are getting the fuck out of this place.

A few months ago I treated myself to a few ""stainless steel drinking straws"" for a few pounds from ebay. I cant recommend them enough! 

I have recovered residue from these ""luxury"" tooters by scraping, smoking directly (heating the tube and causing the resudue to vaporise. Be careful because its very easy to burn yourself!).

Just now I tried a new recovery method, alcohol wash! I dipped the tooter into 99% isopropyl alcohol and put my finger over the other end (to hold the liquid in the tube as i withdrew it from the alcohol). Shake it vigorously (cover both ends obviously) then dispense the liquid onto some foil. This was then gently heated with a lighter until all the visible liquid has evaporated, then let it sit for a bit longer to evap more. BE VERY FUCKING CAREFUL BECAUSE THIS SHIT IS HIGHLY FLAMABLE!! Even after playing around with the foil and evaping the alcohol, i went and put my lighter to the end of the tooter and big flames are spurting out!  Use a second tooter to smoke, dont use the first tooter until the alcohol has 100% evaporated. Test it with fire to ensure that its not going to blow up in your face before using it again. 

Anyway, long story short: get some stainless steel straws. Level up your smoking game.

Tldr at bottom 


My friend told me he had a Handful of fake 10mg hydros. Here is the kicker though; he thinks they are xanax or kpins.  That just doesn't add up to me.  So my tolerance to opiates is so incredibly high that I would never purchase opiate pains pills unless it was to help a friend out that needed them but would never purchase them for myself.  

So my buddy isn't a scientist or professional when it comes to identifing things just swears they weren't fent or opiates but that he truly believed they were xanax.  Well i happen to love benzos and quite honestly need them and thats truth not just addict reasoning.  Anyways I got him some perc 10s at cost  and instead of charging him a small fee to do it for him  he gave me a bag of these


So here is my question:  have you ever heard of someone taking benzo ingredients and making fake pain pills. I have obviously heard of the other way around and people making fake xanax bars by using fent but just never heard of this other way around. I want them to be benzo so badly but just can't find anything on the internet anywhere of people saying they got this combination. I feel like I know the answer is not going to be what I want to hear but fingers crossed 

Another friend of mine taste tested them because we can usually identify xanax and kpins based on taste but he said he couldn't put his finger on what these tasted like and both of them couldn't really identify what they felt like. 

Tldr. Have you found fake opiates that were actually benzos",1514163445.0

I was recently down in FL doing ok and managed to put together about 4 months then started shooting dope pretty heavy. I never even really used needles before i got to florida but i became obsessed with IV'ing. 

I used for about 3 weeks living in a halfway house but one night I managed to score some bars along with my dope and I guess i was way too fucked up and it was apparent. So the house manager came and you all know the drill I was asked to leave for 3 days and go to detox. 

So I went to detox which was pretty nice and got comfy with the subs and valium. Somehow word got out to my previous treatment center that I had relapsed and they wanted me to go back to treatment. I really didn't want to go cause I had a great job working with dogs and didn't want to give that up. Eventually I agreed to go up to PA to do an IOP and live in a recovery house. My decision is influenced heavily by the fact that if i did not continue treatment i would lose financial support from my parents which i rely heavily on.

After agreeing to go to PA my grandparents brought all my stuff to pack up and they brought my mail as well. I had forgotten i ordered 50mg of clonazolam and when i saw that package i managed to pocket it while they tech at the detox was patting down the rest of my shit. 

I have no idea what happened but I remember taking some in the detox then waking up in the hospital and i had apparently given the shit out to other people there so there was like 5 of us in the hospital and I just remember literally not being able to walk. I would stand up and collapse.

I got back to the detox and obviously i couldn't stay there so they transferred me to there other facility a few hours north of where i was. I finished that and came up to PA and have been here about 2 weeks.

Now I'm sitting in the house and nobody is here cause everyone went home with their family and it really sucks. My family is still supportive but I'm still alone. Not being able to use sucks too but im toughing it out cause i don't want to fuck up again. So i just wanted to reach out and say if anyone else is in a similar position please feel free to reach out and chat.

I hope everyone has a safe and happy christmas. Love you guys.",1514158791.0

So I have some disc herniations, arthritis, neuropathy and some more and since I'm in mid twenties the surgeon doesn't want to do spinal surgery unless absolutely needed. So I go to a pain doc.

I've tried epidural steroid shot and never had good pain relief from much. Vicodin/hydro prescribed on and off since the 11th grade. Eventually the hydro dose kept increasing and I wanted to cut down and my doctor tried pure bupe for me and it works some and definitely helps nerve pain, but my back for when working bupe isn't enough. My doc wants me to go to percocet or hydro my next visit.

Ik and I'm sure he does I need to wait at least 48 hrs to feel a dose, would you ask for some extra stronger meds to make sure I breakthrough? Also with IR I don't like after 2-4 hours I have pain that comes back. Ik morphine er isn't going to get me nodding but I'm looking for something for pain mostly. I remember one time I had maybe a 90mg morphine my body actually felt good almost all day unlike the oxy feeling is just a rew hours of relief for me.Like anything I can wake up and take and have my body feel somewhat pain free during the work day would be amazing. What's the good longer acting opioids these days? 

I've tried opana er 30mgs and those actually helped pain pretty good, it just felt like it took almost 3 hours to help me out. Would asking for something short acting (ir) for when I first wake up and an xr to last through out the day? 

Also the doc literally asked me to choose between Vicodin, hydro, percocet and I denied n stayed on bupe instead but ima give something else a try again. I haven't said I've tried opana to the doc do you think I should suggest opana really helped or is that suspicious?",1514158211.0

**Entry 9** - Sunday, 6:00 AM

My roommate, Ben, who has been detoxing off meth, finally woke up after sleeping since Wednesday. I hadn’t even said a word to him after nearly a week of being his roommate until this morning when finally realized he had a roommate. For a minute I honestly considered he may have died in his sleep, but even in that case I would be happy to have have my own room so I let him be.

He seems cool though, dude is huge and used to play football in college. Built like a refrigerator and about as tall as a telephone pole. He’s got droopy blue eyes and some shaggy black hair. Got hooked on pain pills from an injury and it took off from there. I don't know how or why he switched over to meth but everyone’s got their story. He let me use one of his blankets because I’ve been freezing my dick off over here, so that was nice of him. Ben seems to be a great roommate so far.



**Entry 10** - Monday, 11:55 AM

Dickhead Doug, my case manager, wants me to write a “Dear John” letter. Which apparently is a letter I write saying “goodbye” to my addiction. Writing a letter to a semi-abstract medical condition sounds fucking retarded, so I’m going to write a breakup letter to my drug dealer instead. Here it goes:


*Burke,*

*What up man. This is Chip. I’m actually only a few blocks away from your place right now but I’m stuck over here at Pinecrest.*

*You were the best dealer ever. You always had shit, and it was always fire. And even though you didn't use, you always let me fix in your bathroom. Afterwards you would even let me chill on your couch for a bit. I really liked being high as hell and watching you feed your fish and telling me all about your gun collection, that was cool as fuck. Also, your cat was dope. Skittles is chill as shit and I liked when she’d sit on my lap and start purring. I really appreciated all that.*

*I loved what we had going. But still, what I didn't love was the hold your product had on me. I didn't love giving every penny I earned to you. I didn't love how I only felt good when I was coming to or from your house. I didn’t love being a willing prisoner. And for these reasons I need to say goodbye. I hope I never see you again. Say goodbye to Skittles for me.*



**Entry 11** - Monday, 7:32 PM

I have been here for almost one week now. Place isn’t too bad as far as money grubbing rehabs go. A member of staff took me on a walk around the grounds again. Upstairs they got a sweet common room with a big flat screen and a jenky ping-pong table, and outside there’s a rusted gym area--none of which I am allowed access to until I finish detox.

My days on the 1st floor consist of laying in my bed, eating, writing, and lounging on the sofa in the front atrium while watching VHS tapes on the colossal 32” tube TV. Been hanging out there a lot to try and get a feeling for how the staff operates--shift changes, meal times, personal tendencies, that sort of thing.

Sometimes late at night, if nobody else is around, the janitor will prop open the back door and smoke a cigarette outside. I timed him last night and he was out there for two and a half minutes. Going that route has some potential in its simplicity.



**Entry 12**  - Tuesday, 10:08 AM

Moved out of the detox ward today, over to general population (they get mad when I call it that). This was nice actually because I wasn't supposed to get moved out until sometime later in the week. But they told me I could finish my suboxone taper on the upper floor and hurried me out.

I don’t know if it’s just my rising anticipation to make my escape or not, but it feels like there is some added tension between staff and clients recently. Seems like they are suspicious, or nervous even. I do realize this is probably just all in my head though.

I have two more days of subs then im off it completely. I’m still on Ativan and clonidine which is nice.



**Entry 13** - Tuesday, 3:24 PM 

My new room is pretty comfortable, surprisingly. I don't have a roomate yet so I pushed the two twin beds together now I’m sleeping like a king. 

I have been scheming of ways to get to the teddy bear key ring. I need to figure something out in the next couple days while I still have access to the medication window. And now that I have access to other parts of the compound, I have also been collecting tools and other things I might need for my escape. So far, I have come up with a hammer, a phillips screwdriver, a keychain flashlight, and about 10 ft. of cable rope that I took from broken gym equipment. I was also able to talk my way into getting my small hiking backpack back from the front office to keep in my room.

Groups and classes got canceled today so I'm just chillin in the room thinking of getting high when I’m out.



**Entry 14** - Wednesday, 5:40 AM  

I woke up to a girl’s voice in the middle of the night. Got up and soon realized the voice was from the next room, coming in through the air vent. She was trying to get my attention. I was annoyed at first, but she just wanted someone to talk to. So I did. She turned out to be pretty chill. 

Long story short, her main thing was oxy and this is her first rehab. Her name is Chloe. She finally decided to get clean after her longtime boyfriend OD’d in her arms last week. But now she is having second thoughts. She agreed that Doug is a huge dick and is a creep. He spent most of the session bragging and looking at her tits. 

She said she likes to rollerblade, I thought that was rad in like an ironic kind of way. Anyway, We talked until the sun started to come up. She started snoring and, not going to lie, it was adorable to listen to. I’m glad she got some sleep.



**Entry 15** - Wednesday, 8:55 AM

I was sitting at breakfast with Ben this morning trying to scope out who Chloe was when a kid I hardly know came up to us and started freaking out. He was convinced his roommate was trying to kill him. Ben got up and scared him off. It was just a weird situation. He was on the verge of tears and looked genuinely terrified.

Ben said the kid is in rehab for spice and bath salt abuse, so his paranoia actually makes sense now. He’s the guy always smoking the American Spirit cigs out on the patio. He’s like a skater punk type dude. Wears the same thing everyday. Green hoodie, black skinny jeans, and a pair on converse that look like he’s worn all his life. It’s not at all uncommon to meet people in rehab who have fried their brains with their drug use. Anyway, going to have to keep an eye out to avoid him for now, I don’t feel like dealing with other people’s drama.

I'm 

For the record I know lots see the thread title and flock to the comment section without reading anything I wrote and saying how two partners using will never work and it's dangerous when getting clean and wanting an argument. I understand and know this. I have been to rehab like 6 times in the last 15 years. Been thru some rehab romances. Anyways I didn't meet this girl on drugs we met like only a few days after I got a POF after moving alone to a new city (NC is a terrible place dont go. Pretty much goes for SC alabama and well hell....anyways...she found me she's fine as hell we've been together 6 years I hid my dope use from her for a couple years (I traveled for work alot and she lived a good 45 mins away in a kinda bumpkin town so we started casual (ie not 100% exclusive unspoken)

The girl has seen me go thru so much considering we met at 22 when I was young and dumb and sloppy on purpose...rehabs jails halfway houses homelessness RICHES(had a couple good jobs)...when i use for a spell I pretty much hit rock bottom....clean up long enough to surprise everyone and actually accomplish shit...then the gorilla comes out of hibernation. Im sure alot can relate. It blows I started doing this in high school basically (got wds for first time senior year didn't IV for a good year tho after when in the dorms for my super accelerated 1 and 1/2 semesters of further education (this is the one thing I am consistently mad at that I can't get back.)

Anyways to the point if you go to the first post of this account long story short we lived in nola for over a year and moved to alabama this summer to get clean after a 14month bourbon st classy run. Its a miracle we kicked and yeah it was I guess more traumatic to her even tho I almost seized but no big deal done it a million times.

Only something else happened.

The light like never came back on in her. After about 6 years of LOVE BABY were like that couple probably with the PDAs I mean not trashy but I mean like everyone knew us as the couple who never faught like we were good for each other. Started sniffing a lil tweak here and there we both got jobs a week after kicking exactly almost at the same waffle house basically and yeah I'm not gonna justify it yeah Tina entered the picture which was never a problem for ne (loyal to down) but my girl just lost her father to it a couple years ago and he was always in and out prison when she young and I haven't met her only brother in 6 years because he's been in prison the whole time for ""shit"" that's what they call it (that's what it is) basically it's an issue for my girl KINDA like dope is (double screwed I guess) ANYWAYS

My babies light never came back on . she became friends with this just trashy young 20 something girl that worked at the restaurant with us for ONE DAy before she got fired....the girl that everyone talked shit about for being a bag whore....anyways they got to be close and my girl and me faught she started using behind my back trust was broken it got ugly and I wound up leaving alabama to move back to New Orleans at the end of this summer. With no phone no car only 14 dollars and a backpack full of clothes nowhere to go no nothing. And I was heartbroken.

I posted about going thru that a few months ago I was super bitter swear id never talk to her. I also started back sniffing dope (no iv didn't even crave it) daily and things were falling into place I was working renting a room making decent money miserable but I'm the fucking man. Dope just handicaps something in me.  But I got thru it....picked a habit back up....

Anyways I left alabama hearing rumors from our ice dealer ironically who wanted to bang her and had forever that she already had a new bf. All these rumors. He said She said shit that for 6 years before we never would have let touch us. At that time with her trying to live the trailer life with some slut meth girl choosing that over me. Basically shit to make me want to leave town asap (I literally chose to be homeless and penniless to get away from her asap. She became full time then like what I get flashes of now.

For some reason when we do even a little meth together we fight. Some of you will understand me when I say just because we are doing some drugs you may picture us as some zombies to the outside world but with me on that shit my line between functional and a mess is razor thin I am either able to work or if I shoot enough or smoke enough I can turn into a (harmless) carpet picking fapathon mess. So when I say do some meth together I do a line at work sometimes on the weekends never bring more than .3 home. I did a free line Friday night at work and brought home less than .08 prolly that she shot. Bought a 20 last night that was really fat I was geeked yesterday and bought a shard bubbler bong and a torch at the gas station and wanted to get a sack all day but the dude ghosted until 5am. For a 20. Tweaker dboy said the neighbors (he does live right in the heart of idk how to describe it it's where lil wayne is from) got my dudes house shot up like 10 times. Whatever I finally got to put 2 smaller than rice sized crystals into the bong and blew like 3 fatass clouds felt so good I grabbed my spoon threw like 4 or 5 rice crystals in....and that's when my gf walks in having woke up. We had like a normal 20 im talking half or more of the sack still and I guess I was so fucked up I let her start doing her thing (she packed a FAT ASS bowl and then wanted a shot) . anyways she did it all there wasn't even .05 left it was literally one hit.

That was my sack. I paid for it. I copped it. I was gonna do it all or split it with her...hell the lil shot she did Friday I gave her all i had which was less than a point which again I saved for her but she like demanded it. And when I called her out tonight it's ""no I didn't"" she will scream and get so defensive saying she didn't do that much....WHY....

Like. Arguing over a dub of some bottom teir nasty drug that I guess she has some issues with now because of her family and ""how it took her away from me during the summer"".

Now of course the dope sack is sacred. I mean if she water whips my shot (99% of our cops are together do it all right there together. Do this at least twice a day every day on and off for 4 years. I have caught her trying to run game on me with ""we each get 40units"" and then handing me a rig while she's already trying to hit with 60 in hers. Could be an accident I mean guys for years we didn't have these problems and I mean our scores are consistent my shots are all pretty much the same color or consistency.

Here's a big part of the issue. Shes always worked since we really got serious a few years ago (before she was kinda a country thot sry babe). Shes a knockout and she's charming and we live right by bourbon street hell unbelievably she still gets western unions she got one today actually from when she shot girled on bourbon last YEAR. Shes that good. But she's worked for 2 weeks since she came back to nola and she's been here months. She worked like two weeks maybe at a cafe but she ""couldn't deal w the bitches"" got a job like a month later she just started a couple weeks ago and got fired out of nowhere before she made it out of training. She was late a couple times right since being hired. She swears another waitress was jealous or something Idk....but I have been begging her to get a job since she got down here but idk HER LIGHT ISNT ON.

Shes been talking about needing to see a dr to get back on antidepressants but hasn't done shit about it just sleeps all day usually if she's forced to get up she just goes back to sleep after a shot and idk how to help her. She's always bounced back. She was the rational one for a long time. She has an appt. For a psych in 3 weeks but ofc I had to set it up. Gonna be up to 6 weeks possibly before her meds start working so pretty much gonna be sourpuss city some days for another three months.

I am not perfect. I get a little irritated these days but I'm not verbally abusive I just tell her having to support us and 2 habits is hard help me plz...she acts like what I'm doing isn't good enough anyways.

We are drug riddled obvuiusly. But Im ready to kick and get thru mardi gras after Feb and then head West which was my plan from the get go. Not trying to geographical cure myself I just don't love Dixie no more half of Motherfuckers here are retarded. I'm worried that if she gets anymore stress on her she's really gonna go fucking crazy. I know this is where you want to scream this is why junkie relationships fail but idk man this is my girl we are talking about. Shes obv hurting. 

Its hard to look at her with a straight face but she was screaming at me in front of Walgreens earlier drowning out the loud classical music they play out front to discourage loitering and it truly hit me man she's not in there. I thought when she got here after she slept a week straight she would be happy finally. Didn't happen. She screams how she's just gotta wait on the doctor and basically me supporting her 100% and both our habits really I'm not a nag like that i mean I tell her ass but I'm supportive isn't doing enough. Like that she wouldn't be so bad off emotionally if I wasn't so crazy. Like bitch your the one desperate for happy pills sitting on your ass 24/7 getting down and you got the nerve to tell me ""you think your superman and so good and your not"". I mean a part of me says her sad ass should go see how many better boyfriends she can get with the attitude and the dope and the meanness. She begged for forgiveness for losing her way and pushing me away this summer. Got it on pretty good faith from others too she swears she wasn't with anyone else and just using and got sucked in after the hard detox and to cope with us having problems blah blah blah she should be making this easy on me.
I have fully supported her for years before for long stretches I can be cool if you are sweet to me. I don't do bitching

Basically I'm dealing with a depressed fine ass junkie best friend supposed life partner who has tweaker tendencies and is more delusional than I thought.

I'm tired y'all. She just got a 200 w.u. for Xmas. She got a 50 one too today. My folks sent me 250 Friday. I wanna go to work tonight but don't have to She just ugh",1514144443.0

I was heavily addicted to prescription amphetamines and snorted 30's from time to time but I was never addicted to the 30's. A few days prior to the fateful Christmas morning I met my first heroin dealer in the Walmart bathroom. I was taking a piss when this tatted up thug lookin mofo came in and was on his phone talking about grams and selling this and that. I honestly thought he was talking about weed so I intruded and asked him if he sold weed cause I need a new plug. He said, ""nah man I sell heroin, you fuck with that?""  

.        . Na bro I don't fuck with heroin but I'll take your number down anyway. Worst decision I have ever made. Fast forward Christmas morning me and my buddy are snorting Adderall and smoking blunts when he asks me, ""you ever try heroin?""

.          . No but I know a guy. And that was that. We took our meesly $40 and hit up the dope man for the very first time. It was BTH and we had no idea what we were doing trying to smoke it lol. We probably wasted half of the dope just burning it trying to chase the dragon. Needless to say we got pretty fucked up and I loved it. To this day it's probably my best high I have ever had in my life. I fell in love right from the start. 

.         . Fast forward 5 years later and I'm still doing the shit and fucking my life up worse and worse with every passing year. Fuck you Walmart bathroom heroin dealer. Fuck you 19 year old me for being so nosy. I guess we get what we ask for.",1514143861.0

Needles & Rinsing Cottons,"So I’m driving to work the other night, and I swore my headlights were out... pulled over, got out, checked, and they’re fine... then I start to notice everything is mega-dark. When I get to work (it’s a dark establishment inside), I’m having a hard time seeing my coworkers... just wondering if any of you homos experience the same? 

And when I got home, I discovered a new method of rinsing my cottons that’s AMAZING... well... amazing if you have the supplies. See, I live in a state where I can get whatever needles I ask for at Walgreens. One time I even tried, just for the fuck of it, to ask the pharmacist for a box of syringes and when he was ringing me up, I said, “Oh. And I’ll take two doses of Narcan.” Surprise to me... it worked! As it should, I guess... fuck it, if I’m gonna do it, lemme minimize the risk...
Back to the rinsing:
2 Lure Lock 1mL syringes
1 18ga Lure Lock needle 
1 injection syringe (your choice)
1 your favorite spoon. 

1: remove plungers from Lure Lock syringes. 
2: attach 18ga to one
3: stuff wet cottons into 2 Lure Lock syringes. (Bout 10 max for 1mL)
4: use injection syringe to fill up .5 mL
5: inject the .5 mL into the Lure Lock with the 18ga needle attached
6: push water from that syringe into the back of the other Lure Lock with the 18ga needle
7: push that water into your spoon
8: repeat as many times as necessary.
9: enjoy

Go to dudes house who is chill w/this shit (makes exceptions for me to use electronic payment once in a blue moon since I’m a regular)

I say “fuck it, I’ll take 10 blues. Just request that shit on the app”...5 seconds go by, I’m waiting for it to say declined and drive home sick.

Nope, it worked . Did all ten in a day . Next day, go to different dude, get 20. Now I will be well thru Xmas, then time to face the inevitable. My credit is already fucked so idc. I know it’ll go to collections and will eventually need paid....don’t care right now.

I guess it’s possible that the money will never successfully transfer to homies bank. In which case I’ll fall off the map bc I don’t have sympathy for dealers who charge 30 per all the way up to 10-30 fuckin blues. We shall see. 😳. Couldn’t believe this. I’m at least trying to go the first couple hrs after waking up so I can feel like shit before taking any.

The impending doom of the inevitable w/d cuts through the high reaaallll bad though. Pretty much need 4 blues and half a Zannie to feel like a kid and play video games all day with time flying by.

Most people would’ve switched to H long ago but I’ve tried it twice and the high is maybe half as enjoyable as oxy
 (Obviously I’m not shooting it) . It’s  Lethargic and I wake up throwing up, no motivation.

Oxy is like the best opiate feeling with a tiny bit of upper added to it...don’t want to let it go but I know I must",1514142850.0

Jails, planes, family functions...etc. I have a few. One of which sticks out though. I played hockey for my college when I very first started using. Back then it was pills but my habit got pretty high and at this time I was sniffing 6-8 oxy 30’s a day. How I managed to play hockey high on oxy’s (and actually play fairly well considering how banged up i always was) is another story in it of itself but anyhow...My team made it to nationals which was in Colorado. I’m located on the east coast, so this was about a 4-5 hour flight give or take. Me and another kid on the team who also was addicted went and bought a shit ton of 30s to hopefully portion out through the trip. But as most of you probably know where this story is heading, that didn’t happen. So here’s the scene... I ran out about two days before we left. Played our last game in minor w/d. Had to do team lunches and also my dad had flown out to see me play so i was with him. It was brutal. But nothing compared to the 2nd day. The 2nd day was our travel day back to the east coast. Before our flight which was at night we did a team excursion to a nearby ski village just to check it out and eat dinner. I was in full blown day 2 w/d. It was horrible. The plane ride was even worse. We got delayed on the tarmac for 2 hours. I had middle seat next to a screaming toddler and another lady who definitely should’ve been forced to buy 2 seats. Flight all together took us about 6 hours to get back. Me and the kid who I bought the pills with were both withdrawing horribly. I got the RL, sweats, stomach bile puke, and anxiety the entire time. We got well as soon as we got back but man I’ll never forget that trip. That was one of the worst wd experiences I’ve had. I’m sure it doesn’t compare to jails and stuff but still. It was a nightmare. Especially because my dad was there and he could tell something was up. Brutal. Don’t miss those days lol",1514266959.0

7m5xpy,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7m5xpy/opiate_relationship/,36,https://redd.it/7m5xpy,SevroTheHowler,Opiate relationship,"Hey guys. This is not my usual account, but I needed the advice of my people without certain other people knowing it’s me asking for said advice. Any way. I hope you all had a great Christmas/“insert holiday of choice here”. 
On to the point of the post!
So I suck at making friends, let alone friends who enjoy opiates like I do. I met this person in the land of the online. We started chatting, a joke here, some flirtatious emojis there. Then, upon discovering that this person and myself live very closely, we decided to exchange numbers and get to know one another via text/phone calls. After a few months of chatting/getting to know one another, we decide to meet up and share our “loot” or sample platter, if you will, of what we each get from our own prospective areas. Any way...long story even longer we kind of hit it off. We start hanging out when we got the chance, even if it was just a short lunch break. I have really come to like this person and I’m sure the feeling is very much mutual as this person has told me as much. Such as, they enjoy my company and want to see where things go. 
My question to you all is this: Would you get into a relationship with 
someone who was into opiates/other drugs like yourself? Even if you knew you both had good paying jobs that you were dedicated to, both of you had your own living quarters and forms of transportation etc. etc. 
Would you date another opiate enthusiast? 
Why or why not? 
Do you think it would last or end in disaster? 

Thanks for your feedback!

My family and I got into a pretty big fight (not about my drug use), and it pretty much blew everything out of proportion and ruined our day. Well it ruined my day. 

I'm just trying to savor those moments I get to spend with my grandmother. It's not often that she calls me by my own name anymore. Days like today when she does, I could sit by her side all day and talk to her and look at her and just listen to her say my name. My grandma is the only person who never lost faith in me no matter how bad things got for me. I truly don't know what I'm ever going to do without her... Or what I'm going to do when she doesn't say my name at all anymore. Right now at least she calls me her daughter's name, my aunt, she calls me my Aunt sometimes. I know soon she won't know me is anybody at all, but today she got to be home. She got to be at my aunt's house. I don't believe in anything religious really, but it really did seem like a miracle that she knew who everyone was today. Christmas has always been mine and my grandmother's favorite time. I'm afraid this may be the last year she'll remember it with me.

I'm trying to pretend this fight didn't happen. I'm trying to pretend everything is okay and that this couldn't ruin Christmas. I saw the disappointment in her face when my father and I left still arguing. I hate that I left that way, I hate that I left with that for her to see. I'll see her again. I'll see her hopefully the day after tomorrow again and I know I won't have to end things bad, not with her ever. I just feel bad because we had such a great day and ended on such a bad note. 

I will miss these days with my grandmother so much. All I had was a point to snort and a little Opana so I took everything I had and I just want to go to bed. I'm not high anyway. I could probably use some Xanax but really I just want to get high as fuck and I wish I had more drugs, shocking.

I really hope some of you had as great of a day with your family as I did with mine. It didn't end okay, but the time I spent with my grandma today was more important to me that I can describe and I hope that you all had something wonderful like that happened for you today, too.

https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7m40lc/when_you_have_money_and_nobody_will_answer_the/
This thread was my swan song I thought then my usual connect, who is pretty reliable, says he's eating dinner but has to go cop, himself, afterward and to meet him at his place around 6:45.

I show up at 6:45, his girl who is getting them is there, i give her $70 for 2 blue @ $35 each plus $10 for gas or coke or whatever winds her up and they all pile in the car and go for what I think is a 20 min drive there and 20 back, plus 10 or 15 niceties.

**5 fucking hours** I wait, in severe WD at someone elses house watching fucking Law and Order SVU over and over, all the while getting vague fucking updates like ""dude light. going to hardees now"" like that means *anything* to me. 

Turns out he doesn't have enough, has to drive 40 mins to someone elses house to *see* if they have more (oh yeah did I mention the first guys place wasn't 20 mins away but 45?!?).

So at this poing I'm like fuck it in the butt. I'm over it. But wait. THEY have my money. After 5 hours they say he can't get any more and come home at 11:30. 

Turns out they didn't quite end up with nothing, but just had to tow that particular line because of some other dude in the car. The down side is they only had 1 for me and only $30 of my original $80.

So, TL;DR: I waited 5 hours to pay $50 for one blue tonight.

I don't know if I'm happy that I got a blue or sad and pissed that I got shafted....I honestly don't know.

*Clarification Update* - The ppl that went running for me are friends I've known for years. Now, any junkie, (pill or skag,) is subject to shady behavior and the fact that they came back with just enough to give me one, but not two means I was lower on the totem pole than everyone else. In fairness, if you don't go on the ride to the connect, you're automagically lower on the pecking order than the ones in the car, at 30 degress, in winter, waiting in a Hardee's parking lot. I get that. So the more I thought about it the more I felt slighted but gave up, willingly $10 extra to the girl doing the running that wasn't getting anything for herself. That's a shitty ticket to pull - driving and waiting 5 hours to not get anything. I expected to pay $35 for the pill so I really paid $40 for the pill which is still high plus the $10 for my piece of mind.

Still, it comes to the same. 5 hours and $50 later all I got was one blue.

In contrast, I just picked up 7.5 percs (5 of them) for $7 each (still high but less than $1/mg) and feel 1000% better than I did last night after that blue.

I know whenever I take them, sometimes I feel great but when I really stop to think about it, I feel like the adderall almost always overpowers the oxy and I just feel energetic and don’t get dope sick. I do however love to mix Addys and benzos. Hell I mis them all it’s terrible. But I feel like the proper cocktail makes me take a whole lot less Oxys alone. 

Any actual scientific data to back up all the theories that stims will block or overpower opiates? Would be nice to know if I’m wasting a good amount of my opis when I take them with adderall to get some extra energy going.

And why that matters.","In the 'grand scheme' of things no one 'matters,' so really the only people we make a difference to/matter to are our friends and family. If that makes sense.

We should all think about how our actions effect those closest to us, even not thinking about how our potential suicide would effect them.

We should always try to be the best version of ourselves we can, especially to younger family members because, we may not think anyone could be so stupid, but they probably look up to us.

Our parents only want the best for us, it's why they pry when we think they shouldn't.  So much of who they are is wrapped up in who we are and who we will become.

In my experience, siblings are petty and vindictive and only want to find dirt on you so they can talk about you behind your back.  So we should be better than we are, just to spite them.

Our children are who we really need to be better for.  Sure, we can say 'at least we can be a cautionary tale for them.'  But in the end they are going to pick up traits from us, either through nature or nurture, so we shouldn't stack the deck against them.  Be a good example for them.  Suicide, even attempted, will fuck them up in ways we cannot even begin to understand...

We should always strive to better ourselves.  It not only makes us feel better about ourselves, but it makes the people that matter to us, and the ones we matter to, feel better about us.

Even if we don't plan on stopping our use of drugs, we can strive to be better than we currently are.  We can stop stealing from those we care about.  We can stop lying to them.  We can try to keep a job, even if it's just a shitty part-time job.  We can learn something new, or go to college.  If we can do some of those things, it can make everyone around us, ourselves included, feel better.  And when we feel better, it can make it easier to clean ourselves up if we ever choose to.

Anyway, I recently (like a few months ago) made the switch to H because the pill game in my area has gone to shit. I met my plug through a friend who's been buying from this guy for a long time and he's a super chill guy. He's honestly the best plug I've ever had as far as reliability and timing and such. And he's fronted me a couple times when I needed it which was cool since I was a new customer and all. Price in my area is $100/bun but he's been really good about giving me a deal if I buy 5 at a time. The last couple times he's given me 5 buns for $325 and 5 buns lasts me and my girl the whole week (only enough to get actually high a couple times and then just staying good the rest of the week). I really appreciate the pricing break he gives me but the last couple of times I feel like the product has been subpar and the bags have been really light. Last week I actually got one completely empty bag and 2 others that doesn't have enough in them to make 1 full bag. And this week the bags were light and weak af. I'm not really sure if I should say anything or not because he's my only connect and I don't want to piss him off yea know? I also don't want him to take it the wrong way and start charging me full price for 5 buns because I can't really afford what I'm spending now let alone another $150- $175 ya know? And I'm pretty sure he's not the one breaking this stuff down and bagging it either because he has re-upped and sold to me within an hour or 2.

7m4nn4,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7m4nn4/using_opiates_responsibly/,13,https://redd.it/7m4nn4,LSDkiller,Using opiates responsibly,"Hi all. This sub has quickly become my new favorite. The stories on here are incredibly moving, many posts extremely informative, helpful or funny. But one thing I've noticed is that most if not all users have a mostly negative relationship with opiates. I can certainly understand that and I have felt some, but very few of those negative effects. I was prescribed oxycodone for anxiety and after using it daily for a few months, I missed it very much when I moved to the US. For a few days I was really depressed, but I managed pretty easy with subutex, and just jumped off my last dose of that. I don't think opiates for anxiety are the right thing for me anymore. at least, not used more than max once a week for important occasions. I do think in certain people it can be a great option, though. Anyway, as the title of this post implies, what I'm looking for are your opinions on responsible opioid use. Do you believe it can be done? In your opinion, can people use opioids regularly, but responsibly like others use alcohol? I am convinced of it. While I'm not even sure if I personally can sustain such a pattern of use, I know that there are many people, most even, that never have any problems with drugs. On this sub most of the time however it seems like the general consensus is anyone who is using opioids is using them compulsively. I'd like to hear your thoughts on this. ",1514248986.0

Anybody know the repercussions of failing my urine test. I'm supposed to be tapering down my done and getting off it. But I've been back to using. Had a random urine which I know I failed by using different substances. I've been good I swear. But my case manager had been presuming otherwise and that got me pissed and so I used since everyone thinks I'm using again. And that led to me just being back full swing and using the done to stave off wds.. I'm just afraid they'll kick me out of the program. I won't be able to handle that. 


Edit: thanks for the replies. I'll find out tomorrow when I get called in to have a chat after I dose. That's at least what I'm expecting. And stop going down my dose or go up for a couple of weeks. I don't think I'll ever be free of substances at this point. I just have to keep things together. I'm thinking about getting a medical Marijuana card. Perhaps this alternative can get me off opiates for a minute. Weed has lost its magic ever since I got good into opiates. It ain't even a choice when I had money it's dolphinately going to be for dope. I feel so guilty just had a talk with my mother. She can't have me Fallin back to dope.

We were down to the last few bags and this girl doesnt shoot h. in fact she never did it. she  likes shooting coke so we had the stuff out in two separate piles on the opposite side of the table. I mix my shot n set her up with hers. 


I go to the bathroom real quick and when I come back she hands me her shot and asks me to bot her up. I was barred out on like 4-6mg I was eating all day. so I wasn't like really looking att the shot and hit her.. 

Next thing I know she is like ""Whoa that is good. I feel really warm."" Then was like""I don't feel well."" her face turned completely motionless and expressionless. I immedaialty realized she took my shot. (I shooot 5-8 bags at a time). I FREAK out and she starts to like collapse (more like slowly laying down) so I throw her on the couch and her face turns blue. Shallow breathing..light pulse and not responding. I do a chest rub nothing. now her lips are blue so I tilt her head back n give severe rescue breaths. nothing. few chest compressions, slapping her face nothin.g I I openher mouth n her tongue is like curled back and blue. all of a sudden she starts seizing n gurgling. (this is like over 3 minute period). to top it all off I lost my phone earlier that night so I am panicked. I find her phone n remember if u hit the side button 5 times it puts it into SOS method.

I call 911 report the OD and they instruct me put her side and wait. At this point  toss all the needles, baggies, wipe the counter, and am like praying she is okay. Finally dispatch says they are downstairs- this is a luxury building in NYC but no doorman. So I run downstairs and fucking NYPD, EMS, and FDNY are there (8-9 people). I rush them upstairs and they pull me aside (NYPD.). 

I am watching them put an airmask on her and someone say (I think were going to have  a DOA). the NYPD really get intense and start asking me tons of questions, where she get it..howd she do it..ext. I say idk its heroin and she's odin that is lal that matters. They hit her with narcan,nothing.  I cant tell for sure how they did it but they hit her with narcan again..I want to say IV/IM administration. she pukes and wakes up. They tell me she was about a min from not coming back. she had 30% oxygen level and if she died I was getting charged with murder. 

I go with her to the hospital and they want to run all these bs tests. at this point she is fine. Now normally id say of course run the tests - they wanted to do a CAT scan and all this crap but she's uninsured son  was ike your going get like a 30k bill. it's your call. I wouldn't do it - she agreed. She lives only 5 blocks from the hospital. they gave us two narcan kits and we decided id stay with her and if anything changes we'd come back. mind you she also had a flight home in 4 hours.

Long story short she is fine but done with drugs. then she asked me to be her boyfriend after this was all done haa. she's a good girl and knows all about me soo I guess we are dating. plus she's rich.

OHHH and when the cops left her place they fucked up her bolt looks and we had to call a locksmith who charged 320 bucks to fix the door (the like door hinge broke). Girl is fucking loaded. she gave me her card to get cash and there was 21k in the account. 

also like I said I was barred out I came home and my room looked ransacked. I think I threw out all my clothes n checked pockets for lost bags. 

what a shitty christmas but Im just happy she is okay and that is aol that matters",1514243047.0

Is it the dope or is it that I missed and shot in an artery? 

Also the tourniquet wasn’t on so it couldn’t have been that.

I sit here now with a sub under my tounge, in a nice warm house, I have a good welding career.. hell I'm getting paid to just sit around for the next two days.. but it wasn't always like that.  Just a few years back you would have found me out on the streets, pan-handeling, looking for anyone who felt sorry enough for me.  I used to get excited about Christmas and the week or so before it.  When it comes to pan-handeling, you cant beat it, people hand out exxxtra nice once it gets close to Christmas, especially if your smart enough to hang out by a huge shopping center or mall.  Not only do the crowds help.. but all the spending gets people feeling extra guilty and generous.  So anyways... probably about three years ago I was living in a squat on the north east side of town.  It wasn't proper as I didn't have it locked up or anything and just about everyone in the city had access to it, not to mention it was a burnout so it was gross as hell and depressing as could be.  However it was off the beatin path and wasn't so popular, people for the most part found some where to fix long before the came across this spot.  There where some nights where no one else would show-up at all and even though there were a few other regulars staying, for this part of town that is hard to come by. Any privacy at all is hard earned when your on the streets and it definitely is not something to pass up! believe it or not  people here wait in the bush's under the bridges along the tracks that run through the area, they wait while your prepping your shot and just as your ready to fix they jump out on you and hold you up for it! I even had a friend who says he had already drawn back blood when they snuck up on him, ripping it out of his arm before he could push the plunger down,  its never happened to me but I've heard the stories ;).  Well as I was saying, this particular house was a lot more quiet and this Christmas eve was no different it was early in the evening but I was already inside,  I knew there was a lot more money to be made but I was tired, I didn't want to be out.  I sat on my sleeping bag that I had sprawled out on the second floor right next to the window, I had been watching this younger kid hobble around outside for about 5 min. now, as he made it to my house i knew he was coming in.  I sighed as i heard the front door open, really I just wanted to be alone.  The kid called out to ask if anyone was here and I answered ""on the second floor"" at least he had some courtesy I thought.  I listened to him make his way to my room and as I stood in the door way i could instantly feel his wanting of something.  Had he just been trying to fix he would have done it as quick as possible and left.  Before he could even ask me anything I muttered a low grumbly ""what?"". he proceeded to tell me how his veins were horrible, the cold had made them worse and had just wasted 2 bags trying to hit his neck, he had to panhandle again still half sick so that he could get two more and he had been hobeling outside trying to find someone to hit him in the neck when he saw the house and thought of checking it for a person skilled in the trade of iv drugs.  While this is literally something I don't do EVER, the reason being a whole other story,  I literally thought to myself ""its Christmas I guess"" and made the decision to help the kid out.  As he fixed up his shot, a problem occured that I had not considered before that, I was obviously now craving one myself.  No way my own bags, exactly enough for one fat Christmas morning speedball, would survive the night in my pocket till morning.  As I pulled back the blood and registered in his neck the fuck-it's had already completely washed over me, i fixed the last of my shit immediately after and instantly my relaxing Christmas eve. was no more.  I ended up spending all night pan-handeling as I did not get to a good spot until 9pm and it was Christmas eve.  Once I had got 25 bucks together for another speedball it was almost midnight and by the time i made it back north it was 30 after.  The kid had tagged along with me and as we both walked around the badlands that night looking for dope and coke on Chritsmas eve, I somehow felt better.  My mood was lifted, it felt good just being out in the snow doing my favorite thing with someone else.  I definitely felt better than i did sitting all alone in that squat.  There where plenty of corners out that eve but alot of the good ones, as usual late at night, where inside.  In the end we copped a stamp called 7 up, ok shit but def. not the best at the time.  If your wondering did we get a Christmas discount? the answer is no but that night is forever frozen in time for me and every Christmas i think about it ...every Christmas I think maybe just one more .. BUT .. I have not found the need to do so .. YET.  even though I can feel it getting closer and closer I'm just gonna keep holding on.

I want to keep my Morales in one piece. Ill steal from a store, but never a person. 
Well, long story short, my grandmother is a bitch. She has been mean and hateful to me my entire life,always trying to make sure she pits my mom and I against one another.  and she has been more, and more manipulative and decieteful in her attempts the older I've gotten. I mean this bitch knows NO boundaries at all, none. And I have honestly never done anything to warrant the way she treats me. 
So I was living in a trailer my mom owned until my grandmother called the owner of the trailer park, and urged them to evict me, claiming my mom couldn't bring herself to evict her child. Well it worked, but backfired when my mom let me move into the house she shares with the bitch, until I got on my feet. (I wasn't paying any rent before I was evicted, so taking on a full rent payment, or house payment wasn't something I was planning on). 
So now my grandmother has resorted to straight up psychotic shit. Claiming I pushed her down, I did not touch the bitch. 
So this morning the bitch tried to say that I stole my mother's Christmas present from her. A fucking bottle of perfume. I don't even wear fucking perfume, it gives me horrible migraines. 
Yet my mother believes every single psycho lie that comes out of her mouth, no matter how ridiculous it is. 
I'm seriously to my breaking point. It must be exhausting to be as hateful as she is, and it must be really tiring to maintain so many different personalities in the same skull.
(Side note, I literally saved her worthless life, literally)
I don't know wtf to do. In pretty resigned to the fact that my kids are my only family left.

The case is weak IMO so hopefully he beats it. Hes been out of prison since august of 2016. i guess it was good that was out even that long, but in that time he ODed 4 times so being free it was only a matter of time. This time he ODed at home. He was doing it with a friend, She ODed. He yells down to ask her how the shit was but with no response. Then he goes ahead and does his shot anyways(always a dumbass). The other people in the house realize that the first person had ODed so they give her the only narcan they have. Then, they realize my brother is also. His GF couldnt bring him back so they had to call 911. Its sad that its this way, but the only time you can not worry about him is if he is locked up.

He recently told me that he wants to split because he feels like he shouldn’t be apart of anyone’s life with cravings for heroin and other drugs. He feels like he is selfish and needs to get himself together before we continue a relationship/ starting a family. I completely agree with this but he doesn’t have a major issue with drugs and I am willing to “fight” the demons with him. I know it’s something I can’t control or help him with but I truly feel like he shouldn’t be alone and he’s asking for space. I trust him completely on wanting to grow alone but I’m worried he’ll find himself in the dark hole he’s been in and won’t be able to get out. His father passed away 3 years ago around this time of year and he gets really apathetic towards everything and everyone around the winter holidays. He always says he always wanted to be the father he had growing up because that’s the person who meant the most to him and I believe him completely. So I think having this baby will make him let go of the minor cravings he has for heroin. 

Am I an idiot for thinking this? 

He does cocaine socially and smokes weed often but heroin was never on the agenda. He tried it two years ago and enjoyed it but he never let himself go down a really ugly path with it. The times he has tried it have all been during the winter holidays when his dad passed(assuming he’s using it as a coping method). 

Should I keep the baby and be optimistic or should I abort the baby and give him the space that he wants?

I’m honestly not sure what to do... 

My fear isn’t being a single mother, my fear is having to potentially deal with a dead partner and blaming myself for depriving him of what potentially could have saved his life..

Please give advice. I am financially stable and so is he. We both have good jobs so just keep that in mind when commenting, thanks.

UPDATE:

I decided to abort the baby at nearly 15 weeks pregnant. I am going to give my partner his space and respect his decision to want to figure out how to balance and fill the void of drug use.

7md2i0,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7md2i0/targin_bupe_heroin_wds_slightly_curious/,9,https://redd.it/7md2i0,Wigilante,"Targin, Bupe, Heroin, WDs... Slightly curious..","So, me and my girl have been using Heroin for about 18 months (daily use). It got to the point, as it almost always does, of wanting to get off it. Having done this before and obviously failed, we decided to try a different route than last time, which was weaning off using Methadone (120mgs first day and 10mg less every day for two weeks).

This failed as the cravings got too bad and the heroin was just too accessible to us. However, this time around, we are actually going about it in a proper manner. We successfully scored some french Bupe from the streets and began a taper, we're down from 8mgs/day to 2mgs/day nine days later. 

During Xmas I took her with me to my family in Stockholm and found some Targin laying about. Having never seen this medication before, but seeing oxycodone listed as the main ingriedient, I was intrigued, however upon further inspection, I discovered the pills actually contain Naloxone also. The person in need of the pain medication has no need for it any more and told me to bring it back home with me if I would like to. So I did. 

Being a pharma-interested guy my whole life, I know a thing or two about the affinity of Bupe, how it interacts with the Naloxone in Suboxone, and how the Naloxone effect differs with regard to ROA.
Having been off Heroin for about ten days, only on bupe and the occasional Xanax and Tramadol to lessen the WDs at family functions during Xmas etc. I was wondering how the Naloxone would effect us.

 My personal guess would be that taking ten or fifteen Targin tablets orally, probably wouldn't induce PWD, but shooting them would. My other thought is that the bupe currently in our system (we insufflated the last of our remaining stash about ten minutes ago) would block the effects of the oxycodone regardless of the other stuff. But I was thinking, now whilst going through my phone and deleting all my dope-dealers telephone numbers, if I maybe should buy some more Bupe and taper a while longer to lessen the temptation for relapse after such a quick taper. But then I remembered the Targin.. Is it possible to wait for the Bupe WDs to come, and then dose the Targin for some relief? Or is there enough bupe still attached to our receptors for the Naloxone to send us into an even deeper WD until it wears off and the Oxycodone hits? 

Basically, my question is: What would happen, if:
1: Insufflated the targin when the Bupe WDs are present but mild
2: Take them orally now (on Bupe)
3: Insufflate them now (on Bupe)
4: Wait until after the other opiates are out of our system and then take them in any number of ways

Sorry if I am abit all over the place or am writing confusing. I haven't actually typed anything on a keyboard for a long time and I'm also on some Alprazolam, and it's 6:16am where I'm at and sleep is something WDs just doesn't let me have.

For the unaware, it's a show where they seemingly investigate all aspects of any kind of drug game you care to mention through a variety of hidden cameras as well as more traditional investigative television. However, I'm skeptical about some of the actors and the integrity of the producers.

They seem to get a lot of shit right, but there are some subtle tells. I have a sneaking suspicious that it might be something along the lines of 50/50 real/fake.

Regardless, I've seen a bunch of it, and some of the the shit that goes down can be kind of funny and ridiculous. The one on Staten Island had some funny shit with these cops trying to cold call dealers, and if they weren't cops, they were definitely clueless actors who helped add some spot on, ytypical ""cops who just don't get it"" kind of vibe.

They had this ""cop"" calling random dealers going ""Hey yo, it's Steve, you around or not? I need 8.""

8 what? And just little shit like his tone, and the way he said ""You around *or not*?"" For whatever reason that little bit at the end right there would clue me in to it being a cop. Call it ""junkie intuition"" or whatever, but I think nearly any custie is kind of hyper aware of the wording of their initial pitch, and sort of naturally avoids negative language like that. It's simply ""you around?"" or ""trying to see if you're around,"" or some variation of that. His tone didn't help at all and he kept being like ""yeah, remember me, with the pick up truck?"" It tends not to matter. Any dealer with half a brain won't serve to someone who hasn't been vouched for. But this dudes voice was literally the vocal equivalent of the ""cop knock."" IIRC, they nab the guy for some dumb shit, like a bundle or maybe like 7 bags. 

Another pretty funny bit was this dude going ""yeah, this is my 40 Glock! It's on!"" and his burner was this garbage little no name 40 that looked like an airsoft gun he bought from a corner store or some shit.

Anyway kind of a decent show, figured it might be fun to discuss it or talk shit about it. ",1514344197.0

She's a raging alcoholic and everyone knows it.  If she doesn't have a drink every so many hours she gets the shakes, etc.

Well this time they didn't rent a car, so they have to borrow my mom's car if they want to go anywhere.  My mom doesn't allow alcohol in the house, so if my sister wants to drink she has to leave.  Using someone else's car (my mom's) and then come home drunk.

She's done this twice so far.  The first time my mom knew and was livid.  She flipped her lid, so to speak.  The second time my dad tried to hide it from my mom, partly because he's in denial about my sister's problem and partly because he thinks drinking is okay.

Well, today it just happened again.  She said she was going running, but even her husband knew what she was going to do.  He even told her she shouldn't go 'running' with air quotes.  My dad helped her find the keys...

This pissed me the fuck off because everytime I leave my house for more than 30 minutes I get back to back phone calls from my dad accusing me of going to buy drugs (they live next door).  Even if I'm broke or I have my daughter with me.  If I try to explain what I'm doing, after being asked where I am and what I'm doing, I get called a liar.

So I straight up told my dad I didn't appreciate the double standard.  Dad said, ""She said she was going running."". And I said, ""When I do that, I'm just called a liar.  That's a double standard."". Then I left cause evidently the conversation had ending, if his lack of speaking was any indication.

Yeah, I know there's a difference between alcohol and heroin.  But I never asked for their car to go get fucked up and she's never been called a liar to her face...",1514337426.0

Any advice?,"So yeah I’m pretty much at the end of another run. Broke, defeated, starting to get sick; but this time something’s different. Instead of wanting to scheme up a way to get cash or score money, I want to just get over the fucking sickness and get my life back together. 

I was taking kratom for a few years straight (anywhere from 5-6 grams, 3-4 times a days) and I ended up getting my friend’s brother’s connect. He sells just about everything so I just started picking up addies and he would always show me his dope and ask me if I wanted any. I avoided that for like 2-3 months and then I gave in and decided to try a 20 bag at the beginning of summer. I got super high and then went back to my usual kratom and occasional pills. This was at the beginning of summer like 7-8 months ago. 

I, of course, gradually picked it up more and more. At first I’d wait like 2 weeks between and then eventually... well I think you guys get the picture. And of course I’ve become someone that does things I never imagined myself doing. I haven’t gone nearly as far as it can go and I know it can always get worse. Thankfully haven’t resorted to crime or stealing from family or friends, but now I’m actually starting to have thoughts about that and I hate it.

So here I am, off my subs for a couple months (I was on them for 3 months until I cracked) and getting off a binge of 2 months or so.

I always snort my dope and it may not sound bad for only 2 months, but before that I was taking 16mg of subs a day, and before that Oxy, Vicodin, and kratom. This also isn’t my first dope binge, just the first since I’ve been on (and now off) the subs.

Basically, I’ve been taking some form of opiate for nearly 4 years or more. I’m super scared of the withdrawals.

I did my last little bit of dope way earlier and decided to go to my little cousin’s house to get away from my house as I start to get sick. I’m a 23 year old male and he’s a 16 year old teen playing games right now and probably wondering why I’m acting the way I am.

I have some kratom and just bought Imodium hoping it will help. When I get back home I have 900mg gabapentin which I heard is decently helpful when used properly.

Bad or good idea to go away to my cousin’s as I’m starting to get sick??

I want it this time. I really do. I’m sick of being a fuck-up and disappointing myself and my parents / sister who have done sooo much to put me ahead in life.

I’ve also never tried the Imodium before but I know to be safe with the huge dosing. I know it can help if used with some caution.

I post a lot of dope porn and brag a bit but wanted to start a talk focusing on the other side of what makes this sub so great: Harm Reduction. 

When I first started using and especially IV this place was a life saver due it's endless stories and tips from veterans who give real life answers and less rhetoric than your average harm reduction source. Any one want to share a tip they have learned a long the way that has helped reduce harm, pain and hospital visits? I'll start: 

When i was began IVing I always wanted to see how quickly I could complete the ritual. Taking pride that I could get a shot in under less than 2 minutes. I also found myself with lots of a abscesses and ify swollen hands or arms that could have been anything from a histamine reaction to MRSA and I never honestly knew. I blame a lot of this on my impatience to confirm I had a good clean register. I pretty much took any flash of blood as a sign that I was in and would plunge away telling myself some shots just hurt more than others. Lord was I wrong. 

Since then I've realized how much harm it did on my body and veins but how much dope I wasted and how many great buzzes I didn't get to experience. If you're not 100% sure that you have a register (dark blood shooting up through the middle of the barrel not just slowly creeping up the sides) than don't take the shot and try again. I know this can be frustrating and seemingly time consuming but it's always worth the extra 5 minutes to find a good vein than it is to sit in a hospital or not enjoy your shot because you're nervous you done goofed. 

Getting a false register has also inadvertently put me in a position where I nearly ODed because I had a false sense of how strong the dope was. I would shoot a point, miss most of it and think ok this stuff is mild I can def handle 2 points. Load it up, get a real register the next time and get blown back because it wasn't as weak as I thought it was. This can be a pretty scary experience because you feel like you're going in with good info and that confidence distracts you from being critical and using proper caution the next time around. 

Learn and know the signs of a proper register and what a register from an artery looks like and save yourself heaps of pain and discomfort and trade it in for an awesome rush and since of confidence that you did things the right way. This will make the high just that much better. 

Anywho! That's my one small tip you won't really find in the medical books that I learned along the way. Would anyone else like to contribute?",1514332488.0

Basically in late October of this year I was arrested and held in police custody during this 8 hour excursion that simply shouldn't have happened. I generally take full responsibility of my actions and don't play victim, but this was horse ass. 10 cops, 2 K9 units and the FBI later I have serious felonies hanging over my head on a very prestigious federal site. 

I talked to 2 private attorneys in person, and both of them told me I'll likely get some prison time and that my case is such a shit show that they, as attorneys, want nothing to do with it, but will be hired if I really want them. Discouragement at it's finest.

If you haven't received a court date in 45 days you're supposed to call this number on the back of your tickets that show your charges. It's been around 60 days now, so I called today. 

The arresting officer never put my case in for filing. 

So does this mean I dodged a bullet, need to learn a lesson and continue on my merry way as a confused but trying degenerate? Or does it just mean I still have to go to prison? The arresting officer didn't know what the fuck he was doing and needed step by step instructions from several people around to go through the process of an arrest. Did I get astronically lucky, or does my case not being filed at this point just mean dick and I'll just be getting my court date another couple months down the road?",1514330832.0

I have been using BTH since April of this year. I snorted all the way up until a couple weeks ago then made the switch to IV. I had a previous BTH addiction 8 years ago but had always used some sort of opiate here and there. I don't know why but that feeling I get when using makes me feel whole. This time is different though. I have a wife of 4 years and 2 children under 3. They are the light of my life. Everything has come to the surface about my addiction and I had not used since Thursday of last week. I used small amounts of Subs and some Kratom to help with RLS(which is the worst) and the W/D was not all that terrible compared to what I experienced 8 years ago. Today I woke up with a little RLS but not terrible. But the overall feeling of anxiety, fear, and depression every morning is overwhelming. I drank some Kratom but no subs and felt decent. On my way to work I was looking for a lighter and found a rig. I thought I had thrown them all out... apparently not.....Long story cut short finding that through me for a loop and I ended up relapsing today. I do not want to use any more. I have a great career a wonderful family but if I continue to live this life I will lose it all. I have put my wife through so much and it hurts to see the pain I have caused. My son is 3 yrs old and is starting to pick up on things and I do not want him to go through this. I guess my question is whats next. Will I go back through the rough withdraws all over again just from this one relapse? I am done with this shit. I know the feelings I am experiencing (anxiety, overwhelming fear, and depression) are fake and are caused by my drug use. Any suggestions or hopeful stories that can shift my focus and help me understand this is not permanent and it does get better. I will recover if I want to. Which I do more than anything.

My first ever opiate high. It was amazing, best thing I have ever felt. I wasn't expecting much off 10mg as I am 6'2 and 185lbs, but started with that dose in case I was one of those people who are sensitive to opiates, which I now think I am probably am. 

I am happy with that high and am not concerned with chasing a ""nod"". To be honest anything stronger than what I felt (complete full body euphoria and bliss) I would consider overkill. My question is if I wait 4 weeks between every 10mg, will I ever develop a tolerance or need to up the dose?

I ask because some drugs like MDMA, you never really get that first time high back again, even if you wait 5 years before taking it again. Though I believe this has something do with the chemical composition of MDMA and how it is processed in the brain, which I don't think opiates have (I could be wrong).

Yes, I know what you will say ""your once a month plan won't work and you will become a weekly, then eventual daily user and addict"" ... ""everyone thinks they're different but it will happen to you too"". But that aside, lets assume that the four week gap between doses is never broken.

It was a Saturday and I had to be at work at about 5 pm to deliver pizzas. I worked at a hungry howies at the time. Everybody there really liked me so nobody expected it was am OD, ended up passing it off as a woerd episode haha. So I go to my buddies house cuz he said I should come hang out with him and his family by the pool. Well, I get there and he is SCHLOBERED. Tore up from the floor up. ""Oh pig what's up Bro"" falling over himself trying to get out the door. Well he claims he hasn't done anything in 2 weeks (he had been having problems with using to much) and was baffled why everybody was getting upset with him for being so messed up. Next day his uncle.calls me PISSED off because his grandma found all his dope and it was a LOT. turns out he stole some from our dealers bag thinking he wouldn't know and dumped a bunch of cut in it. Well now the uncle didn't know this at the time, and the grandma gave the uncle the dope to get rid of. He decides to sell it. So when he called.me up he says that's why my friend was so,messed up yada yada so says he will sell me what was left for cheap. I oblige and happily travel that direction. Get there, make the deal, got a g for hella cheap. Some of the absolute best shit I have ever had probably ever will. I do some, proceed to hang out with the uncle, feeling good. My time to go to work has come. I drove the 10 miles to my job, and proceed to eat some pizza in the lobby before my shift. Well next thing I know I open my eyes and I'm laying on the dough table in the back with EMTS all around me. I wasn't sure what happened at first. I got them to let me sit up. My ears are ringing. Not the ""somebody is talk g about you"" ringing. I mean it's the ONLY thing I could hear. The medics were screaming in my ear so I could try to follow there instructions and I just kinda laughed and said look I can't hear you, let me stand up. Walked around a bit. Told them I was fine but they forced me to go to the hospital under the threat they would call the cops if I didn't. Okay I guess. Get to hospital and doc finally comes in, I tell him I'm fine and would like to leave. He has no problem left I g me go, even though all the nurses seemed to think I should stay. My grandmother picks me up to take me back to my job so I cam get my car. That's when I realize I don't know what happened with the dope before I passed out. Did I have it in my pocket this whole time? Nope. Start freaking out. What if I dropped it at work. What if an emt got it. I got back and thankfully it was sitting in my console of my car. Greatest feeling of relief. Went in and coworkers were say I g how I was turning blue and not breathing that's when I was like oh shit I just OD'd. They had no clue though. I then went home and dumped all the dope at the bag and just stared at it. I had never had anythi g like it and it really scared me.

This was a comment he received. I found it interesting that we tend to demonize opiates and here this guy talks about them like they are god's gift or something. 

""Hey man I feel you... I really do. I was majorly depressed for a while too. What got me out was opiates. They worked for me better than any meditation technique or therapy or antidepressant. With opiates I can function like a normal person of society. It elevates my mood so I genuinely feel happy while also motivates me to do stuff. Normally I wouldn't recommend it to anyone considering that they can also ruin lives (addiction, OD etc.) but since you decided to kill yourself anyway I figured you should give it a try before you go.

I get it if you are skeptical, but drugs really aren't that bad. They are natural remedies for various ailments, both physical and mental.
When I decided that I will try self-medicating myself I was beyond the edge... I thought, oh well, I want to kill myself, I have nothing in life that I enjoy... Since I have nothing to lose I'll give this a try! And oh, man what a great idea it was. It gives me pleasure in life and relieves me of my depression for the long-therm. I'm currently attending the University of Edinburgh with many ambitions and life-goals. I only got in because with my depression gone I could really flourish in school turning my grades around. Which in turn lead me to feel better about myself. You see, it is a self-propagating thing.

So all in all, I know this probably won't be a favorite advice around these parts but it is my own experience. Weed also worked for me for a while before but it just made me too cloudy and also worsened my motivation which wasn't too good to begin with. On the other hand opiates leave you 100% clear in the mind. No stoning effects. Just an elevated mood, motivation. Euphoria and kindness. It turns you into a better you.

Now the question this all comes down to, is it that bad that you can only live and function with a drug? Would you even ask that question if you were a diabetic needing insulin every 12 hours?

It is still better than being dead. I think that natural drugs are one of the biggest pleasures of earthly existence. Drugs, Food, Sex, Sleep, Achievement, morning dump,  Love. These are all the little pleasures you would give up on by offing yourself.

I tend to think that we depressed people don't really have a disease. We are just people with too big of a heart and maybe too much scar tissue. It would break my heart if you would end it all just because you were never given proper medication. Not the pharmacy shit that Big Pharma pushes. That is just garbage to monetize on. Real medicine lies within nature. Opiates were cultivated even by the early hominids as far back as 40,000 years ago. 

Just because we live in a society where a small elite lie to you and spread anti-drug propaganda for their own financial gain don't you give in!

Personally, I prefer Trolli Sour gummi worms, but to each their own- regardless, I can agree with the consensus that I always find myself craving something sweet & sour when I'm high. I don't find myself going for anything chocolatey, it always has to be sour and gummi. Basically anything sour and gummi is what I crave, and I know that many people agree.

There has to be some sort of scientific reason for this... do opiates make you crave sour candy? Does the sweet and sour sensation affect dopamine or something? I know sugar causes little surges of dopamine (or something? maybe?) and that is why people love it and get addicted to it. Can anyone shed some light on this?

And why is it Sour Patch Kids? IMO, I think there are many sour candies that are better than these, and there are many that don't destroy your mouth if you eat too many. Like I said, Sour Gummi Worms are far superior. But if I'm going for Sour Patch Kids, the cherry ones are fantastic, as well as the peach ones if you can find them. 

I remember years ago when I was in high school (probably over a decade ago- yikes) the Rite Aid by my school used to have these sour caterpillars that were absolute fire. They didn't have a super soft texture, it was almost like they were a little stale. They were fucking perfect. [This](https://i5.walmartimages.com/asr/e791adc2-c032-4516-b230-71d80bbbabd9_1.ef442328aadbdbbcabbc142e46fc25e1.jpeg?odnHeight=450&odnWidth=450&odnBg=FFFFFF) is what they looked like- they were red or green with the yellow bottoms to them. Haven't found them since high school. Would love to experience them again.

I know what I'm asking is super vague and probably impossible to truly guess, but I would appreciate any speculation on anything that could possibly be pressed to look like blue oxycodone A 215's. 

I've bought these specific pills multiple times from the same source, and as far as the pills themselves go they consistent in appearance and effect. They are just almost comically obviously pressed, and they are not fentanyl (unless there is a much weaker analog that I'm not aware of) and they are very obviously not oxycodone. I gave some to a friend a few times and he insisted that they felt and acted just like H, but I've never tried dope so I have no point of comparison. I have had pressed fentanyl sold as oxycodone though, and this is not similar at all. 

I will post the best pictures I could get of them in the comments, and I'm going to offer any information I think might be important. I'm sorry for the length of this post, I'm just obsessed with finding out what these ugly ass presses are. 

They do not seem to have a better oral BA. I find the effects to be much lighter in general when I eat them, very little euphoria, no nod, almost like eating 10mg of hydro. Snorting them gives a nice rush, nothing comparable to fent though, which ends very quickly and causes me to bump all night and then get sad when theyre gone.  

They are extremely soft. There is no coating. Powder starts to come off just from holding them. A whole pill is easily crushed when a card, and the powder is super fine. The edges of the pills are jagged, like they have been crumbling just from being stored, and sometimes the imprint is nearly rubbed off. 

They are a consistent color throughout, no speckling. Sometimes they are a darker or lighter shade of blue though, but it's never too far off. When crushed the powder is still a consistent blue.

The powder is completely flavorless, it's not bitter at all. 

I don't know much about pressed pills, and I really don't know much about opiates. I used to use tramadol a few times a week but other than that I only ever occasionally used hydrocodone. I've done pressed fentanyl a handful of times but that was months ago.  Even though nowadays I use these pills maybe less than once a week, every other week, I think I wouldn't have that great of a tolerance to oxycodone, yet I can snort 3 of these and feel a pretty desirable effect. 

Please, please help me speculate on these weird pills. It's driving me crazy lol.",1514421796.0
7mj4bm,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7mj4bm/whats_up_with_all_the_fentanyl_lately_and_how/,13,https://redd.it/7mj4bm,Homura_Akchemical,What's up with all the fentanyl lately and how much has shit changed? I feel lost.,"So speaking from someone who has a novice habit of only shooting dope since 2011, fentanyl is something that's a bit unknown to me. In my city we get half gram corner bags and you gotta go down to the sketchy-ass BP station to get stamps or hard, and they'll for sure burn you if you don't look in the game or scared about where you are. But we know the city usually only bites back if you provoke it.

 Personally I been going thru the same dude for my entire journey and he's been speaking to me about fentanyl dropping people left and right and about how he keeps his shit clean, and after seeing friends try and go to outside sources and drop the next day it starts hitting home. It's not the same market out there that it was, it used to be dogshit or dog food now it's dog food or instant death. Fucking single stamps are killing people I've known who have used for years.

I know that i'm not trying to buy outside who I know anymore for fear that i'll OD, but I have half a bag of the dope that my friend cold copped and died off of doing 1/4 just in case I feel like shutting it all down someday. I've narcaned 3 friends and been narcaned 4 times this year, the worst of which involved countless kpins and 7 shots of narcan in the busiest intersection in my city and I am only alive thanks to the presence of my friend. I've been to 4 funerals this year for people around my age, slightly older or younger, and i'm only 27. But I still copped today, despite everything logical saying not to. I needed to. I needed my shot of life/death. Fuck anything else until I get that.

I'm sorry this turned into a rant but I have only recently been seeing the major damage that fentanyl has brought to my city and we're for sure not the worst. If you have a dboy that brings you shit you don't OD on, keep buying off him. You get off E, you stay functioning, that's what you need, you go and try another dboy's dope you gonna be the statistic on the news or in the streets that makes everyone flock to that dude's shit. My dude says they're making hot bags that would kill a bitch 20 times over so that their shit gets the word out about its strength. We already have to deal with addiction and a daily struggle to be straight and now there's an added risk of dying instantly mixed in? Not that there never was, but now narcan ain't even bringing you back from it, and the whole game has been spun around.They can't do this shit to hard or shard or nothing else, just the shit we need to function daily, and at this point I almost don't care anymore. But for all those who do, and who really want to keep on going, don't trust that new dboy on the corner. Stay straight don't topple, be easy.",1514421742.0

**Entry 24** - Friday, 2:05 PM

As I prepared to leave, more people began gathering outside my door. They all seem to be in some sort of group psychosis. None are saying anything coherent, just the same heavy breathing and raspy guttural noises. Every once in a while one of them will call out in a sharp scream that sounds like a dying cat. 

I can see at least six pairs of feet under the door just shuffling around in a mess of bloody footprints. Joey’s arm finally detached itself and is now lying lengthwise on the floor twitching erratically, blocking my view. They keep scratching at the door, but none of them will respond to anything I say. 

My first plan was to bust through the door and go get the staff until I saw one of the nurses’ badges drop to the floor when I was peeking at their feet. So, it appears the staff is mixed up with whatever is going on as well. I really have only one option which is to push my forward my escape plans to right now.

Because my hallway is blocked I’m going to have to improvise. First step is to take my hammer to the wall between Chloe’s room and see if I can get through. Hopefully her side’s hallway is clear. 



**Entry 25** - Friday, 2:42 PM

I was able to make my way into Chloe’s room. I had to hammer out the vent and some of the drywall to get through into her room. I made quick work of it, but still the sound seemed to draw more attention from those outside my door. I am just thankful the second floor walls are not built with cinder blocks like the first. 

Chloe is sitting on her bed busy taking apart the cable rope I brought and braiding it into a stronger, much longer rope. She is even more beautiful than I had imagined. She has an adorably small nose, slightly pointed ears, and dark brown hair against bright green eyes.

I put everything we had that could potentially be useful and packed it tightly into my backpack. We are almost ready to check the hallway. It sounds like it is still empty.



**Entry 26** - Friday, 3:30PM 

Let it suffice to say that a lot has happened since the last time I wrote. We are holed up inside a storage closet on the first floor. We made it down Choles’ hallway only to have the power go out on us once we made it to the stairwell. Some emergency lighting went on but the lighting is minimal at best. 

When we peered out of the stairwell, it was hard to make out much but there appeared to be a lot of people moving around towards the other end of the hallway. At that point, we decided to head back to the second floor and see if we could pry one of the windows open to scale down with my cable. But once we headed that way we heard movement coming towards us from the upper floor where we just came from. We had to make a run for it out into the first floor hallway. 

Luckily, I was able to open a nearby storage closet with the teddy bear keyring I had stolen yesterday from the nurse’s office. We are now hiding in the closet with our backs against the wall holding the door closed with our feet. It smells like there is smoke coming from somewhere in the building. 

I’m guessing there are around 10 people outside trying to get in, scratching on the door and groaning. We are going to try and wait it out, whatever ""it"" may be. Been in here for about 20 or 30 minutes now. I’m starting to worry about the fact that the smoke is getting thicker. 



**Entry 27** - Friday, 4:07 PM

After sitting in the closet for about 40 minutes Chloe started hyperventilating. Apparently she has asthma and the smoke was making it hard for her to breathe. I knew we couldn’t make it much longer sitting in the closet so I went out into the hallway. It sounded like most of the people had lost interest in us by then so I thought it would be safe. When I opened the door I saw that the only one still out there was case manager Doug.

He was almost unrecognizable. He had a gash on his neck where it looked like someone had torn off a sizeable chunk of flesh. He had the same black eyes, sandpaper goosebumps, and pale skin as Joey. 

He was trying to grab me with his hands but he was missing most of his fingers, so ended up just smacking me uselessly with his palms. I kept trying to grab him and shake some sense into him. Yelling at him asking what was going on. He got me to the ground and had almost bitten me until Chloe jumped out of the closet and bashed his temple with the hammer. His head nearly exploded and brain matter flew all over. I could hardly move when Chloe dragged me back into the closet as more of them starting coming in our direction.

All the commotion and noise seemed to attract others back to the area. So now we are back in the closet holding the door closed. I’m starting to wonder if there are any sane people left in the building or if everyone has gone crazy. Starting to feel like we are caught up in a zombie movie.

Don’t know what we are going to do, there sounds like there are a very large group of people outside the door now. We can’t stay much longer. There is definitely a fire raging somewhere in the building and it is getting closer. This might be the end of my escape. I can at least take comfort that I will die with Chloe.

A couple of weeks ago I went out partying. We used coke, 2cb, ketamine and such. Sooooooo, I just got home after Christmas bought a bubble H at the park where the junkies usually chill and found another in my jacket! I wanted to make a JJ post for that. Finding dope in my jacket that is. But it just got sooooooo much weirder. 





I cooked up a few filters from my pre Xmas speedball binge and got well, when I noticed the tooter I used during that last partying weekend. I only thought about the coke and nothing else when I rinsed the tooter and shot the rinse. Well, it's been  ketamine and I feel like I'm sitting inside a Christmas ornament that's hanging from a tree and holy fucking shit, if I wasn't as experienced as I am, I'd freak the fuck out right about now. Experiencing Iv ketamine when you expected a rinsed speedball - even if it's just the tooter residue - isn't for everyone. My reality is slightly warped and I wish that I just had cooked the dope I've found... JJ I get it. I shouldn't have pushed it! Thanks for the unexpected high anyways. Lol.

I just want to thank you for your input once again and also provide a little update to this opiate soap opera. I guess I “jumped the shark” as they say. Even though we had gotten to know each other over a few months, hung out quite a bit and even went so far as to be pretty intimate with each other (interpret that how you will. I don’t kiss and tell) we had to go a few days without seeing each other over the holidays. I knew he had a family and I am not a home wrecker. I stopped hearing from him for a few days and finally decided to send an “ultimatum” message. I did not expect the reply that I received. It was from a family member who advised me that he was currently in withdrawal. I was told that when he got his life together then he would be able to decide if I was ultimately a good influence or a bad influence and he’d be better able to decide if he wanted to go back to his ex wife, be with me, with someone else or no one at all. 

I responded back to his family memeber by stating that I cared for him and wanted what was best for him. I said that I wasn’t some junkie slut that was constantly looking for the next thrill. I said that I just wanted him to be happy and healthy and be able to make decisions based on what his heart wants and not what his addiction wants. 

So folks, that’s where we are. I am once again lonely. However, I have dropped my useage down quite a bit because I was inspired to do so on the off chance he does decide to be a part of my life after this detox.

I’m trying CWE for the first time. I got prescribed Tylenol 4s and I take 2 at a time and that’s roughly 8 Times a day and yes I know codeine is “weak” or whatever but it’s something for me. 

Anyways, so I’ve read threads and I’ve watched a YouTube video. So I crushed up 3 pills to test it out. I poured the powder into a glass of water, stirred very well then put in the freezer now I’m taking it out and pouring over wet paper towels into another glass. I believe that’s the correct process. Does this sound correct? 

Couple other questions. 1) how long does it take to hit you
2) can you mix with anything to help the taste? Haven’t tried it yet but heard it’s gnarly 
3)can it be saved for later? If so can I just crush up like 2 doses and drink half at some point and the other half when I need it again? 

I plan on doing this almost every time to save myself from the Tylenol. I realized yesterday I took 12 of them so that’s like 3,600 mg of Tylenol not including the excedrin I took that’s why I’m doing this.

Started at 5 mg hydro twice a day up to 4x 30 MS ER and 4x 15 OC IR over time as my tolerance rose. I've never copped in the street and the worst I've been through is stretching out my last little bit to wait for my mail or borrowing some pills from someone and paying back after I get my refill. A couple of times were my fault and a couple of times were the VA screwing up by not shipping my meds to be delivered Saturday when my new script started Monday.

I've been going pretty extreme to get myself completely off. I'm set to have surgery in 18 and I don't want to be on the other side of recovery taking even more than my previous highest dose just to stay well not to mention manage the pain.

I've been using Kratom here and there, but this latest key is garbage compared to what I had before or I just don't respond well to this vein. I've also got a script for 3600 mg gabapentin for neuropathy and a script for 200 mg Modafinil for second shift sleep disorder. I've found that a combo of these two makes going between doses a hell of a lot easier. My pharmacist at the VA also hooked me up with some Meloxicam for an anti inflammatory so I don't fuck my stomach up with Ibuprofen and she refilled my old trazodone script to help me on nights where I can't sleep.

So where I'm at now is 10.5 - 30 mg of OC a day. I've completely stopped taking my morphine and I've been trying to get by quartering my 15s, but sometimes I take half at a time to get by. My tapering symptoms have been RLS, Cold Feet, Sneezing (fuck this in particular), Diarrhea, and I've been insanely horny. Like my libido all came back at once. 

I've been able to deal with most of this pretty well so far. I'm just wondering at what point do I just say fuck it and jump off for good and ditch my shit? Does anyone else have this same kind of experience that could lend me some of their wisdom? Even words of encouragement would be nice. I'm just tired of being Me plus opes. My wife and I have been together for almost 8 years and I've been on meds for over 5 of them.

How best to dose though? As the sought out effects are mainly from Tramadol's metabolites such as o-dsmt. If one were to take a high dose in one go then the total level of o-dsmt in plasma would be lower than if the Tramadol had been incrementally dosed? Due to enzyme saturation and drug elimination.

I have access to 200mg ER.

One of my friends told me something that just reminded me how some people can really just think of us as scum of the earth. l don’t think being a user in itself can make you a bad person. However, I’m sure some have done things that make them a bad person, but that’s in all areas of life.

So my friend has this boyfriend and he’s sort of what you would call a silverspoon type of guy, being born into a rich family and the guy is really privileged. Just dealt a good hand in life...nothing wrong with that. 

He knew a kid from highschool that overdosed and died recently. He said this is one of many that has happened this year. And he said something along the lines of “yeah, just don’t see how someone would want to live that kind of life. They’re all just worthless junkies.” 

And wow, this type of stuff gets to me. Of course he doesn’t even have a clue what it’s like to be in the shoes of someone like us. Being dealt a really good hand in life, it doesn’t surprise me that he would never fathom the possibility of something like that happening to his self. 

And it’s not just this specific situation that necessarily makes me upset. It’s just how some people can judge someone without hesitation. Not even giving thought to things that were going on in someone’s head or what kind of circumstances that the person had to live with. 

And in the same way that l don’t understand how someone wouldn’t show empathy towards another, is the same way that someone can look at us can’t understand why we would do the things we do. 

Just wanted to share this. l hope we can be understanding of people too before we judge. l feel like the life we live makes us more open minded because we’ve experienced a wide variety of life experiences that might give us an edge on the empathy side.

I did my usual amount for the day (around 2 bundles, and a couple extra bags since I knew it was coming to an end) and took .2mg of Sublingual Suboxone @12am as well as 3 shots of heroin. I felt completely fine, maybe a little bit of a stomach ache, but proceeded to get nice nods and fall asleep.

Woke up the next morning completely fine. Bought some dope, been getting high all day, and currently have the Suboxone (.2mg) under my tongue, waiting for it to dissolve. 

Tomorrow, I think it’s suggesting I take .8mg in the AM, and 1mg later that night.

Our author has the unique ability to take readers on an epic adventure of the heart, body, soul and mind. It’s truly a series that no one asked for yet the author seemes pop out these updates more continuously than you can “pop a molly and sweat”. 

Sorry...I thought that would be a funny way to introduce yet another update on my current situation. I review books and a lot of the promotional shit that these companies put in their advertisements reads exactly like what I’ve written above. On to the update!! 

If you haven’t read my previous two posts (or at least the first one, you’ll be totally confused. So give it a read) 

I was finally able to speak with the person I’m crushing on. He told me everything that happened and told me that I was on his mind the entire time. He was worried I would think that he lost interest and quit talking with me or that he had picked his ex over me etc. 
He said thinking about upsetting me or hurting my heart made his withdrawals that much worse, but he felt like he deserved it. I was just elated to get to talk to him directly and not just get an update from a family member. He said that he is going to rehab in the near future and that his mother took his phone from him so that he couldn’t call any of his connects. He does have access to a computer and that’s how we are staying in touch for now. We have exchanged addresses so that we may send each other snail mail and I’ve given him my number again so that he can memorize it/write it down to keep with him on the off chance he gets to use a phone. He said that knowing that I still care is really helping him get through this detox. 

I guess I just feel very alone now. I am detoxing too, but I don’t have a support system or a family that is privy to what I’m dealing with (which he does have these things and I’m happy about that). I don’t want to seem emotional, but fuck you guys...this is hard. I miss him a lot. I just keep going through the motions. Wake up, get ready, go to work, come home, shower, read a bit, go to bed, rinse and repeat. I eat if I feel like it. I try not to think about using. I just wish I could talk to him. But hell I’m lucky we have a source of communication at all again. 
I’m thinking about asking his mom if I can come see him on New Years Eve. I’ll tell her she can strip search me or what ever she needs to do in order to feel comfortable that I’m NOT bringing him anything. The last thing I’d want to do is fuck up this opportunity for him. 
My heart hurts worse than these damned body aches. 
If any of you guys have advice on how I can manage my personal journey with this, I’d appreciate it. I feel like this community has been there for me more than my only sister. 
I love you guys, thanks for being your crazy selves *hugs for all*

i'm wondering if any of you that have quit an IV habit have a fear of needles. i can't stand the thought of a needle anymore and I never want to get an IV or anything again, it literally scares the shit out of me.

i think this is partly because i was going through a really bad time and was injecting MT-45 for a couple days. this shit is bad news for shooting without proper filtration. it doesn't dissolve completely in water without some heat. It ended up solidifying in my veins a little bit and i had these hard bumps in my veins for a while. 

I literally felt like i had reached the brink of death the days after that. my skin was pale, i looked like a dead person. my veins were completely fucked. the hard bumps have somehow gone away, and my veins have mostly healed through quitting and being clean for almost 2 years now.

One Little Spider

I had the freedom of a fly,

Tenacity of a hornet.
 
Quick to sting,

With little to no warning.

But now I'm a spider,

Stuck to his own web.

With this string around my ankle,

Thoughts of freedom fill my head.

So I have to adapt,

It's either that or die.

Learn a whole new skill set,

To trap my former-fellow flies.

Bring them to me,

With honey, no vinegar.

But even for a spider,

I'm really not that sinister.

I want to keep them around,

Never set my pets free.

And if I'm going down with the ship,

Then I might as well have company.

Cut the ropes to the life boats,

Send them out to sea.

Sinking into this self spun web.

I guess that's where I'm gonna be.

You have to wade through a lot of ""I can hook you up if you return the favor"" type dumbasses, but after two days I encountered a dude who was prescribed oxy but was just casually selling to friends.

I drive over to his town, and wait on a bench for him to show up.  I see a dude who doesn't really look like the pictures, but wearing the clothes he said he was gonna wear, coming over. I walk up to him, greet him and hes confused asf, im realizing I made a mistake and I say sorry and start walking away.    
He says ""wait! come over here!"" and asks me if im trying to score. 

 I say yeah, we sit on the bench and talk for a little while, exchange numbers, and he goes off while I buy my oxy from the tinder dude, with two new providers in contacts. ",1514495093.0
7mpbt2,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7mpbt2/thank_you_for_keeping_me_off_opiates/,12,https://redd.it/7mpbt2,Clay_Bateman,Thank you for keeping me off opiates.,"I've been fucking around with Oxy for a couple of years. Never daily. Maybe 7 days in a row max but my use was starting to increase and I went through mild physical withdrawals a couple of times (I say mild but it felt terrible, just didn't get all the awful symptoms I read about on here).

Anyway I visit this sub a lot. It's triggering in a way but I think if you read enough of the posts, the message is clear, 'Stay the fuck away.'

It's interesting as well because misery loves company and if you're in a bad, fucked up situation, it's almost human nature to want to entice people into the same lifestyle. But people don't do that here so I think you're a kind bunch, really.

I'm not saying you're all miserable or anything like that but still I do feel the overwhelming advice is to stay away and get clean if you're already hooked.

I haven't used opiates in about 70 days and I think about opiates probably 3 hours a day. Visiting this sub helps me not relapse. So, thank you. 

I hope one day soon I'll spend less than 3 hours a day thinking about opiates. ",1514494268.0

So earlier today I was at the plugs house and someone had brought some Mbox’s in to sell(about 100). Well we start doing business and I noticed that they were fakes, I know what real ones look like and they were easy to see that they were fake. So I ask buddy if he knew they were fake and he gave me a bs story on how he didn’t know they were fake and they were fucking him up when took them. 

So my first thought is they’re fent presses. So my curiosity got the best of me and I snorted one. I snort one and I didn’t get anything off it. I assumed they were just presses with nothing in them. So 20 mins later I decided to bang one and that’s when I noticed something really odd. I got a rush like cocaine. My heart was flying and I couldn’t sit down. I gave my partner one and they described the same thing I did, a cocaine like rush/high. 30 mins later we are both perfectly fine and no longer high. 

Needless to say we didn’t do business and we went our separate ways. Basically I just want to know if anyone had had a similar experience with presses like these or have heard of an upper in roxy presses? Would greatly appreciate any and all input. Thanks. 

Also, I plan to drug test myself later tonight and see what I took.

Trying to get a clue as to what it was I looked to see if my pupils dilated or constricted or if they got all red. None of that happened. I've talked to a few other of his customers and they said it did it to them too. Like it gave them massive social anxiety and they just felt all weird.

7mzjfv,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7mzjfv/new_years/,26,https://redd.it/7mzjfv,Deathinaglassinebag,New Years,"Don't kid yourself with trying to get clean on New Years... It won't work.  Sure, someone might power through it and become a minority in doing so, but when the sickness becomes too overbearing and you are lying in your own sweat, vomit, tears and shit you finally feel well enough to maybe eat and drink something from your damp bed sheets; you will only get the strength back to go out and cop again.  Seriously.  My time in Boston and again on New Year's '11, '12, '13, '14 and '15.  

I've been addicted to opiates since 2010 and have been an addict since 2001.  I'm 32 now and jobless living with my rents hoping to see 2018.  Sure, I've been lucky enough to find myself in a clinic since 2015 with a stint of relapses on occasion and I feel as if I'm the living dead.  I'm past due for my expiration date. I've been spoon fed 
pharmaceuticals from antidepressants to antipsychotics and won't take it unless it's got a black label notice.  Quacks; being in and out of rehabs, jail, and mental facilities I finally find some solace in being ok with myself knowing I should have been dead a long time ago.  

May god rest her soul, but seeing my friends sister dead in a coffin laying there peaceful in her eternal slumber made my bones envious more so than upset.  Knowing if you are reading this now then you are at least able to know that you are breathing, and feeling ok enough to think that being alive isn't fun unless you are being put on some kind of narcotic.  I am more than jaded and paranoid looking over my shoulder since I can remember and it's finally to the point that even drugs don't even give me a form of escape that I yearn for.  

I've tried suicide more times than I can count and a 10 bag shot of fire dope can't cut through my 100mg methadone daily dose to black me out of this hell we call life.  I know in death there is where we find true peace and love.  The love here is temporary and fleeting.  It's uncontrollable and unpredictable.  I know this is sounding morbid and dark, but is it where we fret and shy away from the bad things we call horrors just the only thing that we all will face eventually.  

I've been giving a ""nickel ride"" in 2015 around the time of Freddie Grey's death. Put handcuffs on your wrists as tight as you can behind your back and sit in a squatting position for 2-3 hours and then you can feel the torture I've been through.  I've been legally kidnapped and beaten by the people swore to protect us, but because I use a substance deemed illegal by sheltered minds, I deserve being pulled out of my running car, by plain clothed ""officers"" not knowing if they really are the ""good guys' and manhandled until I rat on my friends whereabouts.  Of course I wasn't going to put him through what I've been through and so without drugs or reason they are allowed to just kidnap you because they have this thing called ""probable cause""...  Those are just a couple of injustices everyone on this board may and can face in the U.S. or Philadelphia.  (Fuck philly it's overrated and too hot for this shit)

I hope all of you have a great New Years and hope your resolutions are to find a middle ground for your habits and get into a maintenance program or long term treatment facility, because cold turkey and self abstinence will NOT work.  I wish you luck, but don't kid yourself.  Here's to a New Year and new beginnings.  Here is too the loved ones and people we know who died from their battles with opiate addiction and too the boys in blue who get hard ons putting people like you and I though hell to give themselves a sense of accomplishment. May you all take care and be safe this New Year.  /rant",1514608133.0

this new sample I got is more like a grey/slightly brown but more grey colour, still has the same vinegary smell but is really rocky, like every time I crushed it up to a powder it still seems as though its rocky, I have attached a picture to give yous a idea what I am on about, I have smoked and snorted some but it has had little to no major effect, I think more of a placebo effect :/ and tastes the same but a little harsher than the other sample and it also stings in the nose, the other sample didn't sting

I've ALWAYS stayed under the 3,000 mg limit, but have never once stayed under the 1,000 mg single dose limit (Usually I'll go 1600mg APAP in one dose. Maybe twice a week) 

So do you think I'm doing any damage to my liver? What is YOUR limit? 

Now I read from a chart called ""Recommendation For Referral To Emergency Department (ED)"" that says Acute, Single, Unintentional Ingestion of Acetaminophen"" which says ""Refer to ED if estimated acute ingestion is: Unknown OR at least 10 grams or 200 mg/kg"" 

Link for that is here: https://www.uspharmacist.com/article/acetaminophen-toxicity-what-pharmacists-need-to-know

From the above quote, would you assume that a single, one time dose on a healthy individual is not usually a cause for emergency unless it is 10 g or 200mg/kg? That would seem like a LOT. 

Is it possible that one time use of a high dose (4g and up) is not as dangerous as the accumulative effects of 4g's every day? ",1514579757.0

(Serious),"Hey guys. I’m in my late 20s and weigh about 70 kgs. I work as a sales representative in a company that sells electricity and industrial pipes and I suppose I’m doing ok for myself. I have an ok family, few close friends and a woman I love dearly. 

The reason why I’m telling all this is that I’d like yall to know that I’m not depressed, suicidal or whatever it is that makes people wanna do heroin but ever since my father was diagnosed with ALS, I lost faith in God and started hurting people that I care about the most, especially my mother and my future fiancee. Then I started smoking cannabis on weekends because a friend of mine said it would help me relax but all it ever did for me was giving me anxiety and shitty thoughts even tho I kinda liked the high. 

A few days ago I went to this barber and I kinda just let it all out and told him about my life for some reason. Guess I just had to vent or whatever and he was like I know a guy who has what you need but you gotta think long and hard if you really wanna do it or not. I asked what could it possibly mean and he was like “you ever done h?” I said i ll think about it and looked it up online and all I ever got was prejudiced websites telling people only about the risks and side effects and saying shit like “not even once” or whatever so I wanted to ask about unprejudiced opinions about this substance to people who actively do it on the regular and could give me the best advice.

So in all seriousness, is it ok to do it a couple of times to.. let s say go on a spiritual journey and find peace even for a couple of days?

I really really just wanna get away for a while.

Quick question for you homies","About to go to my brothers and die for a few days. It’s time. I’ve been on mainly for 10 months, going through a gram every three or so days with the girl. Had major shoulder surgery, and even though they gave me hydros and percs that didn’t do shit, I used it as my reasoning for using. Of course it also helped with the mundaneness (that a word? Fuck it) of being in grad school and hours of PowerPoints, studying, etc. 

But I digress. Fuck it. I’m ready to be clean. I tapered to where 1.5 lasted basically 10 days over holidays, waking up to wet dreams and all that shit but still managed to be normal during that time. I’m going in two days to die for hopefully only 3-5 days of hell. Part of me wants to barely have anything, to embrace the pain and withdrawals as punishment. But there’s the other side of me that’s a little bitch, and wants it to be as smooth as possible to ensure I stick to the plan. 

My question for you guys- I’m going to get bars, herb, and I already have two halves of sub for when I failed earlier. Is this going to be enough you think? My bro says to not worry about subs, for it’s going to prolong the suck a bit, and the offchance I get stuck on those. I don’t want to be dependent on shit anymore, and just become a stoner again. How many totem poles should I get? I’ll prob get some soft just for shits too, to give me something to look forward to? 

I plan to have fun today, I should’ve just jumped off yesterday after the taper I basically did but fuck it. I still have some at home that I don’t want to just throw out or give away. I worked for that shit dammit! Lol

I plan to also use this as a diary of sorts. I 100% am ready, and if this can help one other person who is in the same boat I am then that’s worth it to me, fuck you haters! 

So TLDR- definitely herb and nerves will be utilized. Yay or nay to subs? I have gotten sick off of them prior to my habit so I doubt I’ll continue to use them, but could that be an issue? Has it been for anyone?

**Why do you think most people OD?** By 'why' I mean what is the common scenario - is it usually overestimating tolerance after a clean period? Accidentally buying fakes cut with fentanyl? Just the progression of addiction and ever higher tolerance? What else?

I'm especially curious about fentanyl - do people mostly do fentanyl on purpose or by accident? I was talking to an ER nurse in Portland last night and she didn't think fentanyl fakes were that big a deal...her patients just OD because they buy fent to save money and then just take more and more until they end up in the ER.

veins on my left hand work but then when I inject there and the shit starts to circulate up my arm the whole arm goes red and puffy (assuming the main vein the little hand veins connect to is destroyed)

Right hand veins are thin as a hair, nothing fits in there, too damaged and my right arm has been pretty untouched throughout the past few years..mainly because it's trash. couldn't find a vein there even in the start of my iving. 

I hate shooting feet..too many nerves and it just hurts too much. like my whole foot will be on fire for 5-10 min. also my leg/feet circulation is garbage because I used to iv tar into my feet and it left its mark.  Is there any way I can find an easily accessible vein or even artery (idc I know it's bad). maybe upper arm? I'm super skinny but for me it's always just had too much flesh/mass to be viable that high up. i have someone who can  push the plunger in if need be. not physically insert the needle though, she'd never ever do that.

Is it worth it to go pelvic area(as in upper pelvic near my stomach) or legs? 
not interested in going neck as the drugs need to dilute in my blood because of how acidic they are+ I'm allergic to something in the pills so it spikes my bp up super high every time I inject even in my hand. can't imagine the reaction id get with my neck.

***I don't inject heroin, I inject morphine and methadone both of which are caustic as fuck in the pill form I extract it from. again yes it's bad but withdrawal is worse so whatever.


(I use a 27 g 1/5 needle. can't use anything smaller because I inject a 5 ml solution per drug in separate shots, so 5 ml pull out, find a spot..again.. then 5 ml. willing to switch to 30g if necessary, it just takes a while to push everything in)


I'm trying to taper down and my recent inability to find viable injection sites has reeeaaallly been a pain in the ass. I end up missing half way through and end up having to do more drugs which messes it all up. in the past 2 days I've pretty much doubled my dose because I keep messing up because my veins are just...gone

- Started using Oxy about 2.5 years ago. 20mg would have me in heaven.
- Would go weeks or months between uses at first. 
- Over time this progressed to 4-5 day binges once a month, every month. The reason I didn't use more is because I'm out of the UK a lot and have no access then.
- 20mg doesn't do anything for me now, even with weeks off. 40mg is what I need to feel good but there are many days I've taken 120mg in a day. 
- I don't know if I've ever been physically addicted. I've felt absolutely terrible at the end of binges but not sure if that's just from binging on oxy and coke. That said, a couple of days after binges I've felt terrible, then taken an Oxy and magically felt completely better. so it seems likely I was in withdrawal. 
- I think about Oxy every day, for multiple hours every day. I'm about 70 days clean at the moment. My thoughts are still, 'Maybe if I just go back to using once a month I can get the lovely effects without the downsides'.
- Work couldn't be going better, have a good marriage and am in great physical shape.

been getting a bunch of bullshit lately. it sucks. i got beat for 80 fuckin dollars tonight while i was sick, ended up with a dub of very low quality tar. some sad shit. i'm not really doing anything special tomorrow night but i wanna have a nice time w my girl and that's not gonna be so easy if i'm as sick as i was earlier today. i managed to save about 4 puffs of this garbage for the morning, but that won't hold me for long. i should be able to get ripped off and end up with a miniscule amount of dope that can sort of keep me off sick for a few hours tomorrow. i really don't see myself not getting fucked in the ass by the universe like usual tho. 

so, i'd like to try to get a little bit high tomorrow night. i have a few T3's laying around. think that's my best chance at getting a little buzz on tbh. so, 330mg codeine phosphate, approx. equivalent to 45mg morphine (possibly as much as 75mg actually tho? i'm seeing diff info). i have ~100mg dxm, bunch of dph, and two boxes of lope. i've never used dxm for potentiation. is it actually worth bothering? i'll prob skip the dph, makes me too drowsy. i do also have a few grams of some red vein kratom as well. even if i get some dope, i'll need all the help i can get.

*****************************************************
so i guess my questions are...

any problems with kratom + codeine? i'm hoping the combo of the two super light highs might produce one mild high. god i'm desperate lmao.


i'm a heroin addict. am i gonna feel this shit at all? thing is, my tolerance really isn't that high rn. the tar i've been getting is such low quality, i might make a G last me 2 days or more, but there's no way there's more than like 50mg of any actual dope in there. i swear. so if i've been dosing like 10mg diamorphine at a time and getting some relief, maybe even a little buzz, maybe 330mg codeine will get me somewhere.

is there any place for the lope here? will the effects ""stack"", will it block the effects, will it do nothing at all? 

boofing codeine is a dumb idea, right? i've never boofed anything but i'd totally start now if it was worth it.

Looking for advice and insight!!!,"Hey all- so I've been dabbling for quite a few months with 30mg rocks. Anywhere between 2-8 a day. Snorting is my induction method (though I understand orally has the highest absorption concentration). At first it was great.

Now, I don't feel the euphoric, warm, fuzzy, high anymore. Whether I do 2, or 8, after about 15mins I just get dizzy, lightheaded, and uncomfortable.  Any clue what the issue may be or how to fix this? I'll say that if I stop for a week or two, I'll get an okay high for a day but then immediately I go back to the dizzy lightheaded uncomfortableness.   I don't think that it is tolerance since as I do more, I get more uncomfortable and dizzy. I don't really feel high (and trust me, I took plenty to see if that was the issue). My buddies thinks it's tolerance but it doesn't really make sense as I've done plenty and if I do too much, I just increase my dizziness and restlessness...not my high 

It sounds like I potentially may have a chemical imbalance or something is not producing properly internally. Is there any supplement, or anything in addition I can be taking to help this?

Curious to know if anyone else has experienced something similar.  It's difficult to explain, but now I just get uncomfortable agitated and dizzy if I take for more than a day and would like this no longer to be the case.

Thanks in advanced!",1514711785.0

7n7ezi,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7n7ezi/my_story/,26,https://redd.it/7n7ezi,nopulseoflife77,My story...,"It started when I was 18. I grew up with a very liberal but very anti drug family. The first hard drug I ever tried was ecstasy. It was amazing and I thought what else is everyone lying to me about. I felt like drugs were keys to doors to feelings and thoughts that you can’t experience any other way and I wanted to try and experience everything. Coke was the next thing I tried and I loved it. But my mom found out and put me into rehab. 

When I got out I went down to FL to live with my dad and immediately went looking for coke. I found it and then one day the guy I was getting it from said that he couldn’t get anymore blow that day but asked me would I like to try some oxys, they were cheaper and felt amazing, I was in love . That got me on opiates. Back then in FL they still had the pill mills so my guy set me up with a fake MRI and script history. I went to two mills and each one wrote me 250 oxy 30s. It got really bad when I would run out of my scripts before I could get more the next month. Then one day they passed a law that everyone had to check all the patients history’s and I was cut off. 

So I decided to leave and move in with my sister in Baltimore. That’s when I was introduced to heroin. If you have ever seen The Wire then you know what my life was like in Baltimore. That show is 100% accurate. This whole time I am not shooting up just sniffing my dope which I think saved me. That lasted 2 years and then my sister found out and kicked me out. 

I got lucky and got offered a job out west at a ski resort.  A friend let me crash on his couch and and detox. Then I moved out west. I couldn’t find  coke or heroin out there so I started using mushrooms, LSD and DMT. I wasn’t using psychedelics to expand my consciousness, I was using them to get fucked up as much as could. I took so many shrooms one night that I broke my ankle and didn’t even feel it till I got to the hospital over an hour away. The paramedics were in shock how calm I was. I then got a connect in CA and started moving blow back and forth making a good amount of money. I must have stepped on the wrong toes because I only made a few trips before I got robbed at gunpoint. 

I decided to cut my losses and moved to Key West where I started using lots of coke again. I only lived in the Keys for a few months before my mom offered me a job in her company as a sales rep in AL. I got completely clean. I started exercising and really started making the right choices.  I met the love of my life and prepared to ask her to marry me. With in a couple months my girl dumped me, my grandmother died and I was diagnosed with pancreatitis. 

It was just too much and so I started using heroin again and I quickly turned from snorting to shooting. Didn’t take long for my mom to find out and fire me. So that’s my story, I am going into rehab next week and hopefully I finally get my addiction under control. But for the first time In my life I don’t have any hope. I don’t know if I’ll make it and I don’t care if I do. Sorry to end on such a depressing note. I hope someone reads this and decides not to go down this awful path. ",1514707625.0

Basically daily use. I’ve been up to 6-8 beans/buttons/caps a day, mid western dope all use was intranasal it was all dope, fent/dope. I have some Zubsolv sublingual pills, buprenorphine (5.7mg) Naloxone(1.4mg) 

I wanna use these to help me through the H WD and be done with it for the new year. I tried to do it cold turkey this past week for 3 days and it was absolute hell then I fucked up and started using again 4 days in a row now, I’m down to 3-4 buttons a day and did my last dose 4 hours ago. Now tomorrow I’d like to use these pills to taper off. 

I’ve got all of these prescribed to help: Alprazolam 0.25mg for anxiety/depression, Ondansetron hcl 4mg for nausea, Cyclobenzaprine(Flexeril) 10mg for muscle cramps, aches etc. also Naproxen 500mg for similar reasons as Flexeril. And Trazadone 50mg for insomnia. 

I was wondering if anyone could give me some input on these drugs, combinations and tapering with the Zubsolv, I purchased them on the street as I don’t want my primary physician to find out about my H use. I’m not sure if I can use all of these drugs at once or at my doctors recommended dosages while using the Zubsolv. I remember reading about a quick 5 day taper using buprenorphine but can’t seem to find it now, if anyone had some information on that or a timeline I could use I’d appreciate it! I know to wait as long as I can to take the bupe to avoid paws, I know I’ll be able to wait at least 24 hours but I’m going to try and wait until I’m as uncomfortable as I can handle before dosing the bupe. I’m hoping all these drugs done in unison with the bupe will be enough for me to taper down and get off without feeling like I’m dying this time because last time it was absolutely the worst experience of my life for 3 days. I don’t wanna experience that bullshit ever again so I’m going to keep this in my mind to help keep me on track. The worst part for me was the insomnia, which I’m hoping the Trazadone helps with, the hot/cold flashes. They were completely unbearable. Does anyone have any advice for that? And I seemed to have a fever the entire time which Motrin seemed to help with my fever. I’m nervous about this but I’m absolutely ready to commit and be done with this shit. Any help is appreciated everyone, thank you!",1514706693.0

[(https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/7n3xr2/everett_wa_needle_cleanup_behind_a_home_depot/drzew10/?context=10000)]

**I'm giving you all fair warning now, it's a bit of a wall of text, so if you don't like reading - turn around now.**

Sorry for the wall of text - you don't need to read any of this if you don't want. It was cathartic just to be able to type it all out.

I speak from experience and one of the big problems I've had is the fact that drug use (especially harder drugs like heroin or meth) is (or seems to be) looked down upon. People tell you ""Why don't you just quit?"" (can't count how many times I've heard that). You feel (or at least I do) so guilty about your choice to use drugs and you feel afraid to tell people because of what you think they might say or that they won't understand.

I will say, the one time I went to detox, I felt very welcomed and understood. None of the nurses seemed to be judging me, they all seemed to want the best for me (genuinely). A lot of the nurses I talked to had kids or loved ones who battled with or were still battling with addiction and it gave them an inside look at what it's like. I think that really helps, parents with kids who battle addiction I think is the closest you can get to experiencing withdrawal without actually going through it. I remember when I was trying to quit cold turkey one time at my Dad's house and he came into my room on day 2 and he was beside himself... he kept telling me he just wished he could take all the pain away from me and let him take the burden. I know he would if he could too... that's just my Dad. I love him to death.

So many times when I'm talking to people about addiction, specifically opiate (heroin) addiction, they bring up ""just quitting"". I've always wished so badly that I could give them a day of what I feel like on day 2 or 3 of intense withdrawal. I've never experienced anything like it, it's hell on earth. People can try and compare it to the flu x 10 or whatever, but unless you've FELT it.... it just isn't the same. I would take any flu over bad heroin withdrawal.

I will say, in detox the process was the most comfortable I've ever been when detoxing. I was able to eat and even sleep due to the meds they were giving me. I've been wanting to go back because I need to give it another try... lest I end up dead from complications from IV use, broke and homeless, or worse. I'm just nervous, I know this is a totally paranoid thought, but coming back to detox I'd feel like a failure in their eyes. Like they tried their best with me once and I fucked it up.  I know this is irrational because I knew guys in there that were on their 10th+ times.

I don't think it helps that I'm already social anxious to begin with, so when you couple that with heroin use... well, it's not pretty. I'm already super high strung and up in my head about a lot of things. I always have been. Anxiety and depression run in my mom's family and I'm sure I've got a bit of that.

Then, once detox is over, I feel great for a week or two while the drugs slowly come out of my system and then it's back to boredom, restless legs, inability to get any good sleep. Boredom mainly. I've been using for so long, it's all I find fun anymore. When I was a kid I used to play PC games religiously (it was an addiction of it's own, no doubt) but when I try to go back to them when I'm sober, the interest just isn't there.

I'm not sure what the answer is for me or others, but I hope someone finds some kind of miracle cure. Wishful thinking, I know. I'll keep thinking of ways to help and if I ever get clean, I want to make it a mission in life to help other addicts. I know the pain all too well and if I could help just one other addict get and stay clean, it would make me so immensely happy.  In order to do any of that, I need to get clean first myself, I know this.  I'm just not sure when or how it will happen.  I've only been to detox once and after that I went to a rehab, which I promptly left after 4 or 5 days.  It just didn't feel like it was for me.  I'm shy by nature and that environment doesn't benefit people who are shy or timid. 

I'm not a bad person, I'm really not... I've done things I'm not proud of, but I still try my best to make the world a better place - even while in the throes of addiction.  I do believe I still have a moral compass and it leads to me getting scammed, ripped off, betrayed by so called friends.  Even strangers I see that are struggling, maybe sick, I've broken them off pieces in the past expecting nothing in return... just because I know that feeling all too well.  Granted, this isn't something I do all the time and I have to have extra, but still.  How many other junkies can say the same?  I tend to believe 99.9% of addicts are only out for themselves but there are the rare few I've run into that surprise me.  For how long, I'm not sure.  But that's why I want to get clean - if I was clean and had my desire under control, I think I could help these people.  I'm sure they've had much worse lives than I have and if I can be a friend to them without the constant idea of heroin lingering in both of our brains, I think I could help.  Obviously, this is much further down the road, if ever.  Just wishful thinking on my part.

Try not to tear me apart too much - I know some of these ideas are a bit loony and I'll get shit about more than a few things.  I guess I just wanted to say exactly what's on my mind.",1514705760.0

Perhaps under the idea that the less in the rig, the less likely you are to miss some of the shot? Fair enough, but the reason I use as much water as possible for how many shots i want to do is so that even if I miss a little bit, it won't be much due to dilution as well as adding all that water makes it MUCH LESS LIKELY TO ABSCESS!!

Ive done this once before without issue, im wondering other than the risk of infection from tap water and non sterile fitering, if the binders and fillers in the pill can still harm my lungs and heart etc? I know never to IV pills without micron filtering, but is subq safer?

I believe since it isnt directly into a vein, that the drug is absorbed and the filler powders get left behind. Is that right? And if so what happens to that material? Does it get broken down or absorbed? 

Im just not sure about what risk im taking


As a side note, tylenol 3 and 4 are the stupidest pills.

MY stable dose was 45 milligrams. I stayed on it for 4 months but for all 4 months EVERY time I would sleep I would wake up multiple times throughout the night (more than 5) with my arms throbbing with serious pain but at the same time almost feeling like they are going numb with the tingly feeling, from my fingertips to where my elbow is. It craps and hurts like that for 15 seconds - a minute long and then it eases and stops and I fall back asleep only for it to happen again an hour later. I got off of methadone and it immediately stopped happening. I got back on methadone about 2 weeks ago because it really helps me and I don't use opiates or really any other drugs while I'm on it, but the pain has started again and it is really effecting my sleep. I've also noticed that throughout the day my arms and hands go numb during simple tasks like driving, or smoking a cigarette, texting, etc but it's not painful during the day. I know that it is from methadone because it's only ever happened to me while I've been on it. I know that it isn't from my dose being too low because this dose has me nodding out sometimes a couple hours after I take it. It is really painful to go through this and I can't find any information about it online. Can someone please help me figure out what's going on? Or give me advice on what I can do to fix it?

It’s really good with a strudel and some, flavored, black coffee. It’s as if opium was half way aceitlyzed. 

My dude also has real china white. It’s a tan powder that has the effect of good tar. Moreover it has a tar after taste. This is the real deal; you can do fat lines of this stuff. 

It seems that all the Fent mixer that was going around is gone. This is all in the wake of a dealer named Manny getting busted here. Apparently, Manny was number 1 or 2 in the Los Angeles supply chain. Candidly, it has flushed all of the Fent out of the market and I am enjoying that. For months I was concerned about getting mixer or “scramble “ by accident. Also, it’s been ages since I have seen dope this old school: straight diacetylmorphine.

Every time I come on here and see ECP I can only think, “looks like rocks of Fent scramble.” I’m fortunate to have old school dope and black coffee with pastries for the holidays.

Can I melt down or refine H, specifically Bth/black into a form that I can put in the oil vape pen and effectively smoke it? Is this possible, if so how would you do it? Thank you","The title pretty much says it all. I have a Thc/Cbd ""oil"" vape pen, the kind with a disposable cartridge and rechargeable battery. An actual pen not those big ass vapes people get at vape shops or anything like that. I can post photos if necessary.  I want to refine black/BTH and then mix it in a cartridge or put it in an empty cartridge and smoke it out of the pen. 

Is it possible for someone to do this? I'm guessing in order to do so you'd have to melt it down and/or refine it to some degree. Which is cool because that'd be removing some of the impurities out and create a more potent substance. To melt it down Would it be similar to prepping a shot before shooting up? (I don't use needles and never have so I'm not too familiar with this)

Has anyone tried this before?


Some other questions If this is possible:
-So once it's melted down/refined and ready to be put in the cartridge would I need to mix it with the Thc/Cbd oil for it to properly work and smoke correctly? Or can it be a empty cartridge?

-is there any reason this shouldn't be done? 

I feel like it could be a good idea if you're a smoker considering you're melting it down and refining it getting a lot of the impurities removed so It could be a more potent substance and more discreet to smoke. And if mixed with the Thc/Cbd oil could be a hell of a combination lol

Would it be wasting any product or ineffective to go this route? If so, why/how?

If anyone has done this, has experience doing this, or other knowledge related to the subject please let us know your thoughts, experiences, instructions, etc please.

I’ve tried a forum search on this topic but have not found anything relevant - sorry if this is asked often!

In a month I’ll be flying into Bogata and staying within the country for 28 days - likely taking a number of domestic flights over that time.

I’m sitting on a long term, prescribed dose of 4mg of oral bupe (subutex) p/d as part of a substitution therapy scheme. While this has declined from 16mg p/d and I am shooting for 0, you might understand why I am reluctant to rush a 4-0 taper prior to leaving! Especially when trying to stay emotionally stable holding down this job.

Does anybody else here have experience with travelling internationally - ideally into Columbia or other areas of South Central America - with a legal bupe prescription? Any advice on what is needed to cover myself of this - a doctors signature? A copy of the prescription? Etc - would be *greatly* appreciated!

It’s an oddly specific question to google, but if anyone knows of any info sites out there that cover the rules for different counties or something like that, that would also be awesome.

I have no one else to spill it to so figured id spill it here. A little over a week ago I had over 8 months of sobriety under my belt. Everything was great and being sober and away from the madness was amazing. I don't know why I slipped up there was no reason to do so, but I did and unfortunately addiction won me over once again. So I picked up a couple packs and a few more packs as the week went on I was still flying under the radar. As Friday came around I decided might as well get some coke and go all out since ive already lost all that I worked for the past 8 months. So between coke and h, I had and up and down weekend, no harm done. Christmas came around coke is gone but still doing h. I got my hands on some xans. Christmas night I was feeling great had some xans in me and was going to pick up some more h with an old ""friend"". while picking up the h the dealer had some crack so I said fuck it lets get that rolling as well. between the h, xans and crack I was on top of the world and bound to fall off. I made it home that night. and last thing I remember after that was waking up in the hospital with my family around me in tears explaining to me that without my sister finding me at 4 in the morning gargling in my own vomit I wouldn't be alive.....Just like that 8 months clean and sober and within a week addiction almost took my life. Now sitting here typing this a few days later I'm still using just h. my family looks at me like I'm an alien and I cant just see the disgust in their eyes. I'm alone and feel worse than I ever have in my life. But I guess I can be thankful I'm still alive... Thanks for listening. I was cocky over the past 8 months thinking it wasn't so hard, then boom here I am..",1514652508.0

7n2eqh,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7n2eqh/chipping_on_sub/,4,https://redd.it/7n2eqh,K8ight,Chipping on sub?,"Hello Folks!! I need some advice. A little background. I have real chronic pain. I was in pain management. I left on my own .. just felt it was hurting more than helping me. My oxycodone dose worked it’s way up to about 360MG daily. I just felt sick all the time. I usually took 90mg 4x daily. I decided to go the sub route to get off and hoping that I would get some pain relief from the sub. To my surprise it actually has been working well. I am RX’d 16 mg daily. I have never taken more than 6mg at one time and never more than 12mg in a day. I took my last Oxy on 10/28/17 after being on opiates for 8 years. I am going to start cutting the sub down. I figure the quicker I can get off , the better. 

So now that you have the background ... I want that warm feeling .. that oxy heaven feeling. I know I am doing well and I know it’s dumb .. but if I break down how would it work. I want to be able to take some oxy in between some sub doses. Reduce it a little , take some oxy for 1/2 a day and go back to the sub. I do not want to risk any precipitated WD so there is that. I’m not gonna lie .. I have real pain .. but you and I know that’s not why I want the oxy. Any suggestions?

Again, I know this is not smart ... I know. ",1514651393.0
