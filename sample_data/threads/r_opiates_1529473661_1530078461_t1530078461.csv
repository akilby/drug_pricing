My muscles burned.  I grunted or moaned every step.  It was almost impossible to walk, like I had muscular dystrophy or something, and by now I was sure the lack of chemicals had turned my pupils to the size of nickels.  There was undoubtedly a layer of grease shellacked onto my forehead.  A single strand of snot hung from my nose in the wind and fluttered.  Still I shuffled towards the trio, determined to get that cigarette.

I stood some distance from them.  I asked, 


‚ÄúExcuse me, but could any of you could spare a smoke?‚Äù  But they never looked towards me.  I tried again.  ‚ÄúEXCUSE ME!‚Äù  They continued their conversation.




The girl had a big nose and thin lips.  She was pretty and rambled on the way the way pretty girls can with strange men who will give them attention.  Her boyfriend wore a backwards hat and cheap sunglasses while he stood next to her nodded out, like he was trying to touch his nose to the concrete.  The girl kept calling him baby. I spoke again.


‚ÄúHEY!  EXCUSE ME!  CAN I GET A CIGARETTE!‚Äù  None of the three looked up.  My voice must have disappeared from the withdrawals.  The fat man just laughed.

He said, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs baby having anyway?  Shoot!  I want some of whatever baby‚Äôs having!  Haw haw haw!‚Äù  

‚ÄúMe too.‚Äù  I said laughing like I was in on the joke, but they didn‚Äôt hear that either.  I could only whisper in my weakened state and the remaining 20 feet I‚Äôd have to walk to tap one of them on the shoulder was too far for me.  So, I turned around and walked back towards the bus.  As my left foot slid onto the bottom step of the bus, a warm slime splattered and ran down the back of my leg.  The sickness was just too much.  There was nothing I could do.  No clothes.  No energy to change them, even if I had any.  For the rest of the trip, I stayed slumped in my seat like a soggy, stinky sock, sitting in my own mess, sneezing and sniffling and whimpering for the remaining 12 hours back to my hometown.
  
It was late at night when the driver announced our arrival and I heard the release of the bus‚Äôs hydraulic pressure.  Somehow, sleep had come over me for a moment, the way it does during heroin withdrawals, miserable and fleeting.  Everyone else who got off the bus there was bantering with the driver and crouching to see into the luggage store under the bus for their bags.  I was wearing everything I owned.

Before then I only had an oxycodone habit. I would have done dope in a heartbeat but I never had the chance.

Through junkie jesus luck I found a really chill middle to get dope. I was taking double, triple my sub script (I was on the road to relapse abusing subs). I ran out two weeks early and decided to dive headfirst into dope.

My middle didn‚Äôt try to play me, he told me it was fentanyl and to be extremely cautious.

I still go to my recovery center, I do want to stop but that‚Äôs a whole other topic. My urine screens show a high load of fentanyl only.

The powder I get is most always pure white, fluffy like flower. Sometimes the real strong stuff has little off white pebbles that taste extremely bitter, unmixed fentanyl I imagine. The first few bags had what I think were crushed xanax. There were smashed light blue pieces that tasted exactly like xanax. That stuff was really good despite being absolutely frankenstein fentadope.

Well last night and tonight‚Äôs bags sure are something different. The powder is more of a tan color with dark brown flecks in it. It smells slightly of vinegar and boy howdy does it have the best high.

This stuff is literally the best feeling I have had since my first 40mg original oxycontin back in the day before I had a monkey on my back.

When I take a sniff it doesn‚Äôt hit my head almost instantly like heavy fentadope. It creeps. Unlike fentanyl I feel it through out my body. Infact the euphoria and warmth just grows and grows over 20-30 minutes. It is the best and strongest euphoria.

Without a doubt it still contains fentanyl but the high is so different, lasts so much longer and is so euphoric.

sorry for repeating these nightly but we opiate enthusiasts have the memory of a goldfish so people need nightly reminders. here you are.  

we were stripped from having mod privileges for violating terms of service or something so i have to use my private room apparently? it's the same except it has the youtube player and actual moderation. repeat, new room link, same old chat.   

for those who are unaware tc is a video chat platform that while not perfect, seems to work well for phones and browsers alike. this room is for hanging out, listening to music, and specifically harm reduction so no one has to use alone. it is unaffiliated with r/opiates and its moderators and has its own rules and etiquette. here are the revised and updated rules:  

1) don't do any sort of -isms, it's just not cool and i run a leftist room. your opinions are welcome but no personal attacks or nasty stuff about groups of people. if you want to be rude, get personal, there's plenty of stuff to say about people without going for low-hanging fruit.  

2) don't make obnoxious noises over the mic, or play music over the chat. the bitrate for the sound channel is like 4, everything sounds like crap unless it's played through the built-in youtube player.  

3) don't dox anyone or take pictures or record the chat, this is a place people come to feel comfortable doing various things and anything that violates privacy results in an instant ban.  

4) guests must pick a unique username. no lurking allowed because people stalk people and shit. aside from these, just don't be rude or a douche.  

also, if you don't like me, or the mods, or the room, or anything else, just don't comment and move on. please don't be a hot mess on here, they're doing a good job.  ",1530068783.0

‚ÄúOh shit buds, you‚Äôre right fucked arnt ya. Them crow pricks torturing you eh? Bastards. Hey! I got something that will make ya feel alright.‚Äù 

Spent the night blowing out smoke at this guy, & eventually just holding the pipe near his face to catch smoke cause i was already nice n toasty. 

He would stretch put his head the best he could to get that gud. He calmed right down, he still had a persistent twitch but it was way less severe. He folded up his wings , got comfy & sat down right beside me.

I ended up passing out for a bit, he woke me up by jumping at me a few hours later for that RE-UP. Smoked him up again.

I left at dawn , feeling conflicted as i left. I didnt want to leave him & I didnt have the gut to do what should have been done & put him out. I feel pre good about making his night of hell a bit better tho. The other crows have most likely finished picking him to pieces by now. R.I.P

8u60ph,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8u60ph/quit_relapse_repeat/,2,https://redd.it/8u60ph,ozzy619sd,"Quit, Relapse, Repeat","Back in 2011 I was on top of the word, I had a super good job at a utility company and had a side hustle doing promotions for night clubs that also specialized in model photography. I would get paid to do VIP events at the best clubs with free bottle service and never had a shortage of hot chicks. I was a true hustler.

The partying and drinking would lead to after parties with tons of coke and banging girls in the bathrooms of these parties. I was an alcoholic and as the parties got crazier it started to erode my family life, I had a GF at home and a small baby. I guess she finally got tired of my drinking and cheating and split. This split turned my life upside down and ended up moving in with this super hot chick after one drunken and crazy event. She told me I could move in and do anything I wanted with her, little did I know.

The first night I remember her smoking some shit on foil, I thought is was crack cocaine but really didnt care, we all know know she was chasing the dragon. I watched her do this for about  a week before I got drunk and wanted to try it. I didnt even like it, made me itchy and drive/talk like a retard but Im not a quitter and kept going. About a month later of daily smoking I wanted to quit, but little did I know I couldnt. I was addicted. The of course led to me leaving the utility company and ruining my side hustle, all I cared about was getting well now but hated being a slave to this shit. First thing I did was kicked the hot model girl to the curb, literally kicked her ass to the curb on her birthday and right after her grandma died, wanted to make sure she wouldnt come back. This lead me going to rehab for the first time and a year long course of subs. Took a fucking year for me to finally figure out how to quit subs, the detox facility wanted me on lifelong maintenance and started me super high. I finally got off and fucking hate opiates.

2016 Four years have passed and Im opiate free. Im in amazing shape, have a super hot wife, nice cars and nice house and a semi decent job with 2 kids now. Im doing maintenance at a gym, I love to workout because thats my new drug. My co-worked is some old dude in his 60's, pretty cool but pretty square, I thought. One day I walk in our work area and homeboy is railing something, Im like its all good man I used to do H. I thought he was doing coke, it was oxy and he offered me a rail. Wanted him to see I wasnt going to rat so I did the rail. Next day he offers again, Im like sure why not, its only pills lol.

About thrice a month homeboy would get some oxy 30s from his friends script and we would party. Its when I was hit up by an old friend out of prison that things really took off. Unlimited supply of a variety of oxy and opana and all kinds of other goodies for dirt cheap. My old co-worked financed us every single damn week till we got to the point of being high or sick, no in between.

Here I am now 2018 and still have all the good shit in my life and think about quitting for good sometimes but really dont want to. I still take breaks with sometimes a couple months off but always find a reason to go back, the price is fucking crazy good and Ive become an opi snob now but dont fuck with H anymore. I even got detoxing down pretty good by using quick sub tapers. My wife knows I like to party and she puts her foot down sometimes but she still lets me do my thing as long as I dont drink alcohol. I think some people are true addicts because if Im not doing opis Im doing something else. Anyways, dman has some goodies coming my way and will be on vacation with them. 

Some words of advice if youre a young guy, dont start fucking with opiates till youre at least 25 or better yet dont start at all. Stick to the pussy, weed and booze. Opiates will replace everything you find joy in and will consume your life.

I'm worried I may have screwed up something in my system. Some hormones have become seriously out of whack or I've developed some kind of chemical imbalances in my brain.

8u58cx,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8u58cx/penis_gets_numb/,10,https://redd.it/8u58cx,throwawayeym02168,penis gets numb,"Hi,

Little over 5 years am I a chronic pain patient. I just got 22 years old.

I'm suffering from tingeling feeling (the same feeling you get when the doctor messes up a lumbar puncture, and you feel electricity in your whole body) in my left leg. The pain /feeling is constant, over the years it getting worse.

In those 5 years  I have been multiple times fully examined (pictures taken (X-ray, NMR, CT,...), blood taken, DNA analytics, MS-test,  biopsies,...) and nothing was found. As an alternative for the pain killers the doctors tried almost all existing antidepressants (not for the mental sake), if those in a rare occasion worked it always was for a short time + I got all the side effects you can imagine. After all those experiments / tests the doctors still don't now what It can be the cause of it.

My painkiller scheme:

The first years I was suffering, they gave me Paracetamol and Paracetamol with Codeine, these two didn't do a thing.

I started with Tradonal, I took it for more then 2 years  my start dosis was 100 mg 1X day increasing the dosis to 2x200 mg and 250mg on bad days. The last year I took it, it did't really work the habituation was to strong.

My doctor gave me Tilidine (Valtran), which I took for a month here the habituation was so strong I had to stop it.

The next pain killer he gave me was Oxycodone, when I was taking this I felt weird, so I only took it a week or so + it did not help that much.

The last thing he gave me was Fentanyl/Durogesic 25 micro gram, this works more or less. I'm taking this for more than over a year now.

Now for almost 2 months, I feel my penis is getting numb, I do not know  if it is caused by my unknown condition or long-therm side effect off the Fentanyl. It is not at all sensitive anymore.

General remark, I never am/was at any time addicted to painkillers, I'm able to stop taking them at any time. Although the pain would be so severe I'm tied to bed as long as I do not take them again just for the pain sake. I'm a Law student and my memory/grades are severely affected by the painkillers and my pain an sich, so if anyone has an idea for alternative painkillers or is in a similar situation, please let me know.

Kind regards",1530059934.0

So i've been doing opiates since like 2006 or 2007. i moved to a new city 5 years ago. when i first moved here I worked with a guy that would sell me his extra tabs each month and that was about all i could find besides boy and i really didn't want to start doing that again so i just took the tabs when i could get them and got roxies whenever id make the 6 hour drive back to my home state. So eventually we had a new guy start at work (we'll call him S.E.) that could get pandas. id only ever heard whispers about them when i lived down south. literally no one i knew had ever seen one or done one so when this guy told me he could get them i got one and fell in love. 

So i dealt with this guy as my middle man for like 2 years and everything was straight. Then he started getting sketchy and doing a lot of dope. he ended up ODing at work and i had to grab his lunchbox and find his shit and flush it while he was getting narcaned in the middle of the shop. so he got his job back because it was a union shop and he used fake piss when he came back and had to take a drug test lmao. (that doesn't have anything to do with this post really, its just a story i find funny as shit #ThanksUnion) So eventually S.E. owed me a decent amount of money and we got into an argument and it ended with me backing him up against his truck and telling him that he was going to give me my money OR he could introduce me to his dealer and id forget about the money. so of course he took the free option and then i started going through his guy (we'll call him T.W.) which was great for about a year. so here recently ole T.W. went to rehab, then when he got out he decided he was going to sell pandas and not do any dope since he'd gotten the vivitrol shot and couldn't really get fucked up anyways. So since he hadn't been to work in a while he was broke so he couldn't re-up and be an actual dealer so he was kind of a middle man. id meet him and then we'd go to the plug (we'll call him B.B.). id buy 5 pandas for $80 a pop and then T.W. would get like 10 for that amount of money because he was getting them for like $40 or $45 a piece. i didn't really complain because he was my only connect and $2 a mg isn't that horrible of a price for pandas. So iv'e seen B.B. and hes seen me a few times but we've never talked. So after a month T.W. started shooting meth and became ridiculously unreliable. now hes fallen off the face of the earth. His phone is off and i cant get a hold of him. So last night i searched through every one of his face book friends and i fucking found B.B. So iv'e been to this guys work to pick up from B.B. when i was with T.W. and like i said the guy has seen me multiple times but we've never talked. so here's where my need for advice comes in. Should i just show up at B.B.'s work (furniture store) and  buy a piece of cheap furniture from him and then bring up the fact that i know T.W. and try to talk him into serving me or should i message him on Facebook and see if he'll respond or call me? He always seemed a little sketched out when i would show up with T.W. but i guess that could have just been from me and T.W. being white boys and just pulling up to his house or work in the hood lol. but yeah guys i'm not sure which option is better or if i should just not even approach the guy at all and try to find a new hook up. i know if i was a legit dealer and some random dude id only seen a few times messaged me on FB id probably just ignore it or block the guy. so i'm worried if i message him on FB he'll block me and then kick me out of his work if i show up there lol. i just feel like i'm so close to having a decent hook up but still so very far away lol. but yeah so what do ya'll think? what would you do if you were in my shoes? Thanks for taking the time to read this long fucking post and responding. Stay safe out there fam.

TL;DR my middle man vanished but i found his plug on FB and i know where he works so should i message him or show up at his work and try to get him to serve me?",1530055683.0

That‚Äôs a problem legally here, but it‚Äôs easy for us to trade him some pot for the pills. It‚Äôs a better deal for all involved. He gets plenty of what he wants for the month, and we get what he‚Äôs prescribed. All he gets is those pink 10s, not enough for my boyfriend and I for the month by far, more like just a little supplement.  

This is been going on for a very long time now.  He got filled last Friday, and actually they‚Äôre all completely gone now. We had some people over, and we were just kind of popping and snorting them all day.

It‚Äôs been pretty nice, until today. Apparently he got a call from his insurance agency. I don‚Äôt know all the details, but I think they want to see what he has left for the month, and possibly pop a drug test on him to make sure he has Oxy in his system.

If we never have another transaction with him again, that‚Äôs fine with me, I just don‚Äôt want him to get in trouble! What if down the line his cancer puts him in some real severe pain, and they won‚Äôt give him something strong enough because they‚Äôre worried that he has abused the system in the past. This guy isn‚Äôt a delinquent, just a nice old man who grew up in the 60s and wants to smoke a joint when he doesn‚Äôt feel good.

I have no idea what to do for him.  I don‚Äôt know anybody who has the pink 10s that he has, so it‚Äôs not like we can run out and replace whatever he should have. I don‚Äôt know if that would work anyway, this is nothing I‚Äôve ever dealt with before.

Anyone have any suggestions?

Edit:  Update!  

My boyfriend, who I swear has Junkie Jesus on speed dial, has found a line on enough pinks to get him through.  A semi distant buddy of his, who actually also has cancer, is willing to ‚Äúlend‚Äù us the pills for the count.  He‚Äôll hang with us while our neighbor goes on his appointment, and we‚Äôll wait for a thumbs up. 

He sells them at $7 per, and if for any reason something goes wrong, and the pills end up confiscated or otherwise ‚Äúlost‚Äù, we‚Äôll simply pay for them, and take the loss.  Whatever it takes to get our neighbor through.   This guy sells his pills, so he‚Äôs sympathetic of our neighbor‚Äôs plight.

Today I finally reached a reasonable dose of 150mg. 

While on my journey up to 150 mg- 10 mg at a time a day- I was somehow miraculously able to repair my relationships and get a job. 

This morning on the way back from the clinic I got the urge to cuddle. So I decided to surprise my girlfriend and stopped by her house.  The door was locked and it appeared she was sleeping so, not wanting to wake her by knocking,I started walking back towards my car when I heard her door open. Butterflies began filling up my stomach. 

I ran inside and she kissed me. Apparently I was forgiven. Thank Jesus!- (Both of them). 

After some chit-chat we cuddled up on her bed. She wasted no time- we hadn't been alone together in over two weeks. She immediately yanked my shorts off and began slobbering all over my knob. Yes! This was perfect timing. The methadone hadn't fully kicked in to the point where orgasm would be impossible but was enough to prevent me from blowing my load immediately. It was time to go to Pound Town population 2. 

She hopped on me and inserted my fat throbbing cock into her taught and moist cunt.  She rode my dick like I was a bull named Fu Man Chu and she was Harry Thompkins- three time gold belt rodeo champion of Texas. 

This was magical. I then decided to put those two red bulls I drank with breakfast to good use. I flipped us over and rested her legs on my shoulders. Time for the grand finale boys. I beat that pussy up until she was crying tears of bliss and moaning ""ohhhhh my god'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd""

Then it happened I blew my biggest load to date-  76 ml. Cream pie city bitch. 

Now I'm on my way to a job interview. 

What I'm trying to say is God bless methadone. Things are starting to look up romantically and financially. Thanks to this medication I am now able to get my life back on track. 

Stay strong my friends. The struggle is real but every once in awhile an opportunity presents itself to better your situation, possibly for good.

Also I have always had a high resting heart heart. Normally anywhere from 90-110 just sitting there and now my heart rate is anywhere from 60-90 and when it wears off it jumps back up to 100. The problem is when it's so low I can feel my heart beating so slow and so hard which it's very stressful and makes it where I can't sleep at all.

Supposedly the atenolol should help with anxiety and and sleep but it does the complete opposite. I have a Dr appointment in 2 weeks to see if I should be feeling like this and maybe get some Ambien or something.

Sometimes he'd take half hour to come out of the house because ""dude made him wait"" for whatever lame excuse.. I am sure he was just fixing a shot of my dope. Well...

I didnt want easy access to money at night.  My connect was cool with accepting change so I went to my junk drawer etc and came  up with $30 in quarters.   The 20 minute drive to her new house felt like an hour..  and after exchanging pleasantries and pretending to give a fuck about catching up and hearing about her new place and job.. she weighed me out a half gram and I made the 4 hour drive home.  I noticed I was singing along to the music on the radio and was in a wonderful mood.. the mere anticipation of the shot I was going to do actually made me feel high.. the mental aspect of opiate addiction is CRAZY, but most of you already know that.

He then throws me this extra bag, which was at least a grams worth if not more, and tells me, ""Here, take this shit too, cause you snort right? This stuff has a bit of this tea stuff,  you can use it like an opiate, it's like heroin..""

He said he knew & he is only giving it to snorters cause he understands how fucked the dope is. 

He kinda got how kratom doesn't work thru the nose or smoked and he reassured me there was only a very small amount of kratom in the dope, but i could definitely smell it and see it as the dope had a slight green tint. So since I got it for free I was like fuck it, racked up a few lines. It immediately smells & tastes like heroin with kratom in my nostrils & I exhale a small puff of it too, cuz... kratom I guess. This deff works as heroin but god damn it is stupid as shit. Like now 75% of the users cant use it cause they shoot and it's just a useless cut in general.

The alternative was minimum 1 year in jail. So I stayed clean the entire time of the mandate & I completed on time!! 
Yes I know I relapsed, & I'm also aware of what I did & what I'm currently doing wrong.
With that being said.. I'm speechless trying to describe this shot. I've been sniffing the past week because I was too shook to dive back into it going straight to the needle after 9 months off. After 10+ years of heroin use.. I dont think I've ever had a better high then I'm having right now. Just had to share this with someone!!

Also I could use some education. I'm not looking to get back into actively using every day. I really want to just be able to chip here and there. Obviously I've gotten off to a bad start but I'm not getting high again for another week or 2. My question is , around how long does it take the body to develop a physical dependency on dope? Or if I was using every single day.. how long would it take before I start waking up sick? I once heard it takes about 2 weeks before you're hooked.

Okay, so why my place is getting built I moved in with my grandparents because of how much extra room they have. Now my uncle and SO live with my grandparents and have for the last 3 years. They both are addicts as well and there was a 3 day period last week she gave me 1 piece a day to stay somewhat well (basically saved it until 8 so I could sleep) and I was super grateful. So a few nights ago I got some and gave her a whole B which was more than she gave me total. The other night I gave her a half b and some white cause they like it, but never buy it so I thought they'd like that. I gave it to them at 8 AM and said if you need some tonight, just ask. They never did, and left for the night. She came back at 7 and was sick I guess and text me as soon as she got in ""Thanks for nothing."" So I call her out and remind her that I told her to ask if she needed and she did not and left all night, not my problem. My uncle didn't give two shits. Come last night around 7 PM my hooks phones off and the others closed already, so I ask my uncle if he'd get it through theirs and he agreed. I did 40 cause it's not that good of shit and it was already late. Glad I did because she stole it off his dresser while he was in the shower. He tracked her down after she was already out for four hours saying ""oh I'm getting it we just have to go here"" my uncle tells me that she was all butt hurt how he was helping me after I let them go sick?? He tried explaining the situation to her and she didn't care to hear it. She comes back at midnight and says cash is in my purse. Tell my uncle you should just grab it and do the deal. He forgets and she says my guy is here, just going around the block.. Next thing we know her phones off and she walks in all nonchalant at 5 AM like all was good? My uncle is livid at this point, even more so than I cause I expect it from her now after the previous nights events. She than tells him ""We went 3 different places and no one had anything besides Clear."" We both know she's lying and was out sucking dick, or using that $40. I'm pretty sure it wasn't the latter of the two. One because she does ho herself out for shit, two she loves clear a ton and three we all know that $40 was spent on her first excursion that night. They suck as a couple, my unk is a good hearted dude, and she's crazy. He feels the need to take care of her for some reason. They fight all the time too. The most annoying shit. Anyways, still nothing. So I say I want the money, she says I left it in his car and he's coming back now and he got shit so I will go up to his window and just grab it. He gets back here at 7 AM, she's tweaked out and were asleep, so of course she dips and I woke up as she got in his car and woke my unk up and told him to check it out, which I feel bad for cause no one should wake up feeling like that. She turns her phone off, comes back at 10 AM crying and claims they were robbed of the $40 hahaha. At this point it's comical and I don't even care anymore, I learned a lesson to never trust her again. Today my guy was open again and I got a lot of shit, she wanted some and I didn't give them each one this time. I gave my uncle a half b and let him do what he wanted with it. Tonight I will have him ""come help move my bed"" and give him a few rips and she can fuck off! Haha

Please add input fellow opioid addicts. I need some people who understand how I feel and what I‚Äôm going through. I need some hope.,"    Here it is plain and simple: A person can‚Äôt even remotely relate, empathize or understand even slightly what we go through and why we are the way we are. If somebody tells me a bunch of shit about opiate addiction and has never tried them it goes in one ear and out the other. A person who has tried opiates, heroin and needles especially, can understand why this stuff hooks you the way it does. People, my mom for instance, thinks that I just can‚Äôt get right and do it because I have bad morals and values. 

     I had been to 4 A&D drug programs before trying IV drugs. Sadly I craved heroin and dilaudid SO bad from age 15 to 18 after hearing story‚Äôs about it. I got a tattoo on my rib cage in my first adult rehab. It says ‚ÄúWith the birds I‚Äôll share this lonely view‚Äù. Red Hot Chili Peppers wrote this song about heroin. I got the tattoo, because I knew I was going to be addicted to heroin. I craved it before I ever tried it all the time.

     I have mental health issues that are all severe.   Depression, anxiety and PTSD. I also have the disease of addiction (duh). When I am in active addiction NOBODY can tell me shit. My brain tells me ‚ÄúThis is all you need for your depression and anxiety‚Äù. A shot isn‚Äôt about how long the ride is, it‚Äôs about that moment where you feel at complete peace and bliss. That moment after a shot feels like an eternity. 

      Currently I‚Äôm free of the demon Heroin 1 year and 9 months off opiates. I‚Äôm sorry for the rant guys I just need y‚Äôall right now because y‚Äôall understand what I am going through. I‚Äôm on suboxone, but lately I want a shot so fucking bad I can barely take it. They said the first year is the toughest and after that it‚Äôs so much easier. Bullshit. The only reason I‚Äôm clean is because I force myself to take my medicine so I have the safety net of not being able to get high while on it. 

     My Dad passed away, clean 5 years before his death and was huge in AA. I wish he was here so bad because he understood me. Anyways my mom is an opioid addict living with a doctor that used to own a pain clinic and has a walk in safe with every narcotic imaginable. My mom called me asking what Fentora was one day which is fucking Fentanyl tablets you put under your tounge. My moms boyfriend‚Äôs ex wife just died less than 2 years ago from an overdose. I‚Äôm scared she‚Äôs going to die and she‚Äôs all I have.

      I‚Äôm only 22. I have to sell drugs to get by because my car is in the shop and hasn‚Äôt been running for 9 months. I hate selling drugs. I only sell pills to people that use them as medicine, but I got busted by the narcs at a friends house and it scares me to be selling still. I had 7 different narcotics in a pill bottle they pulled right out of my pocket. In my room I had tons of anabolic steroids and liquid Xan and Valium. God BLESSED me because I only got one drug charge possession of meth. 

    One time I had a stash of heroin, benzos, cash, etc. sitting on my bedside table. I woke up to my mom screaming at me. At this point in my addiction I had to have something in the morning or I would go through violent withdrawal. I was crying on my knees for her to give me a Klonopin and pain pill out of the bottle and she could have the rest, but she wouldn‚Äôt. I said ‚ÄúMom I love you, but I can‚Äôt take it anymore I‚Äôm going to kill myself‚Äù. I without hesitation got in my car, drove 75mph dead into a telephone pole. No seatbelt I just threw my hands in the air. I had not a scratch on me. The paramedics arrived and told me the one I hit had termites in it and was rotten, but if I had hit any other pole I would have instantly died. They put me on a stretcher and asked if I was in pain. They gave me an IV shot of fentanyl. It didn‚Äôt get me high but I all of a sudden felt normal again. 


     I‚Äôm so sorry this is long I probably won‚Äôt get many comments but I need some solid advice. I live alone in my own house with no car in a VERY small town in Mississippi. I have some decent friends, but they aren‚Äôt ‚ÄúRide or die‚Äù. I seriously want to dilaudid or heroin so bad y‚Äôall I‚Äôm hurting emotionally so fucking bad. If I‚Äôm going to feel like this forever I might as well get back on the shit. 

Summary: People don‚Äôt understand opiate addicts if they have never tried them. Clean off Heroin for a year, but recently have been craving it so bad. Having thoughts of self harm and been crying my eyes out writing this hoping maybe someone will reach out to me.",1529961260.0

I have another intact 8mg sub-- but im curious as to whether I should continue to taper on sub (it feels like im stagnating at 0.5mg, with it harder to half the dose than it was to half 2mg to 1mg), or quit the sub now and continue the taper with some kratom or loperamide?

what would you do? im cautious with the sub cos ive heard some horror stories of its dependence, and i feel i'd be better off leaving that 8mg sub untouched in case its ever needed again (and braking up that much extra sub may encourage me to drag out the taper longer than needs be)

i should say-- when i do cut my sub dose in half below what it is, the only real symptom i notice is goosebumps-- but i tend to hyperfocus on em

i also have some fucked notion that alternating opiods during a taper reduces the chance of becoming dependant on any replacement (e.g peripheral relief via loperamide, shorter half life from kratom)

Some of you may find this funny.,"So me and my girlfriend of 7 years are trying to have a baby, we are both 27 and think its time to start a family. My girl does not use drugs and only drinks once in a while. I use oxy on the regular but have been trying to slow down after my script got cut. You all know how that goes but I'm trying.   


Anyway we have been trying to have a kid for about a year and a half and haven't gotten pregnant, so we were recommended to a infertility clinic which we went to and my girlfriend had to get a bunch of tests done because it is suspected she has PCOS, which makes it hard to get pregnant if not impossible in some cases, and i had to get a sperm count/test.   


Booked my test which the earliest i could get in was 4 weeks from when i called, fast forward to the day before my appointment i came into some oxy 40s, (my favourite ones, the old oxycontin formula) so naturally i indulged. The next morning i had my appointment and woke up early, and must have forgotten that i had my appointment for my sperm test and popped 40mg of oxy as my normal routine when i have a supply of oxy. 15 min goes by and i realize ""shit i shouldn't have taken that oxy i can never cum when I'm on it"" but its too late at this point i just have to hope that ill be able to orgasm since i haven't had any sexual activity for 6 days as required for the test.  


Get to the clinic, awkward as FUCK. Bunch of dudes waiting in the waiting room. Receptionist (HOT as fuck btw, which made it even more awkward) calling people up and handing them a container. She tells them which room to go in, all while guys that are finished producing their sample coming back into the waiting area with their container, with their sperm sample and placing it in a basket on the receptionists desk in front of everyone waiting. My turn, i grab the container and head into the room with only a lounge chair and a sink. Proceed to wash my hands and read the instructions, pull up some porn on my phone and hope for the best. Try to do the deed but of course can't reach climax. I can always get hard but its always so hard to finish when I'm on oxy, even from sex i can rarely finish. (good for my girlfriend but not for me, since i can fuck for hours when I'm high)   


At least 20 minutes go by, multiple videos and I'm fucking pulling on my member so vigorously trying to produce this sample and shit is just not working out. I'm thinking I'm fucked and just ruined this whole appointment, but I'm determined to get this sample so i continue. After about 30-40 minutes (lost count of the time) of masturbating in a public place high on oxy I'm finally able to orgasm and get the sample in the container thankfully. Clean up, wash my hands and proceed to make my way back to the waiting room with my sample. Give the sexy receptionist my sample and turn around and there must have been 16 or 17 guys sitting there waiting for rooms to open up so they can go do the same. Get to my car and take a look at myself in the mirror and I'm just sweaty as fuck, hair is a mess, face beat red. Looked like i just finished a workout at the gym. I could only imagine what the receptionist was thinking when i came out of that room when i was in there for 40-45 minutes hahahah. Busted up half of another one of those 40mg pills and sniffed it up for my reward before leaving back home. One of the most awkward experiences I've ever had in my life.  


Everything worked out in the end, but I really wish i had thought that one through and waited until after I produced the sample to get high, I would have been in and out of that place in 5 min if i wasn't high. LESSON LEARNED. Hope you enjoy the story of my stupidity.   


TL;DR I had to produce a sperm sample, waited 4 weeks for the appointment and got high on oxy before the appointment like an idiot and could barely produce the sample, took 45 min and was embarrassing when i came out of the room sweaty as fuck like i just did a 40 min spin class.

So go on,  Homeless and unwashed by choice. There are loads of them; wasting time.Train kis a and smart phones, their logic only reasons without scrutiny.
.    You have -I have, we all have suffered growing up with some r them and once was friends. Then we just knew each other enough to be fbook friends, unsurprisingly that is the fate of the majority of most people I‚Äôve known over the years.

  I always wondered why my dad watched tv or worked on his classic cars instead of ever hanging out with an old friend.  He has always lived with in 30 minutes of the steel city. I thought when I was a hip teenager that he was just a square who didn‚Äôt smoke cigarettes. I was too different for him to accept. Blushingly different.  ‚Äú my little long hair liberal‚Äù my mother lovingly mocked, yet she was endeared to my beliefs.  In another universe, in a dream, but not this world I assume she thought. 

To tell the rest of this maturation tale, I guess I need to start when we all became a tight group. Teenage years have endless luck and moments when people still are allowed for dreams. 

 We were captivated by music, we wanted to be born years before. Hippies, the 60s. Life is so boring now. We became dead heads, we needed a family and they were like us.  So the lyrics go, the bus came by and I got on, that‚Äôs when it all began, for us. We were a trio, The psychadelic musketeers of light.

 Single mindedly dedicated on a quest to map the unknown and obtain the philosopher's stone.  Funding further expeditions to explore the quantum dimensional links of reason and emotion. A,tricky enterprise for teens, riding vibrations and frequencies city to city, set to set like a trusty steed We had each other tethered by the soul if things went arwy, so further we went, times of knowledge once found in caves 50 millennia ago.  Confident and care free , could not be more understated. 

When your skin is massaged by sound and smiles into pulsating euphoric chills of tingling goose bumps that soothing spiral washing over each nerve like aloe Vera on sun kissed skin, you just get it. Or you're some one who didn't.  We did.  Every festival we eagerly  danced and embraced moments so fatefully, it was clear we left spacetime with such admiration and applause, that we knew the universe was igniting our path and jaw dropped future of a lifetime here in this curiosity. This oddysey. Brotherly.

 Reiteration, constant declarations. Words won't ever be proper justification.  Sensory explanations to strangers of tasting neon green and azure blue fireworks bursting into creation behind closed eyes and cramped cheeks from perma grins. You see? Insanity.  A  Lunatic's rants and ravings.

 Sigh.  The Reality is, was - that youth is a shield of its own, immune to consequences and aging. Naive Glorious fools, claiming the round table for camelit, fighting the corruption to cease by the cardinal. Knights of the round table, 3 musketeers.  We stayed noble by choice.  

However Delusions rule youth, how could one not get injured.  After all, there be Dragons here.  That was then but It‚Äôs the present- masks, personas and mumbled truths are ignored. Emaciating situations of the two oldest friends.  Addiction and mental illness, the devil dances on shoulders- we sure were blessed.  Age magnifies are delusions.  We weren't Arthur or musketeers.  We were Falstaff, drunken fat knights, silly, foolish, gluttonous, selfish but  we were always hopelessly noble. Long live chivalry.

          The night mat was discharged from the hospital, he climbed into his mothers bed, like all children do.  I did it until my parents locked their door. I probably cried, I wish mats mom locked her door.  Instead of cuddling and dreaming, he took his orders.  The witching hour, of course.  That night mat slashed and slit his wrists like a thrall. Calmly he must have slid under the covers. I know he Made sure the blanket covered his mom.

 His mother woke up confused. I was confused after the call. It was only 10 hours since we wheeled him in to white faced nurses and confused strangers. Everyone was confused. He was discharged. That night he climbed into his moms bed while she slept, to finish the quests his constant unrelending companions gave him.  cutting his wrists to the bone.  Then  waiting to meet them. Beckoning. His mother awoke in a sticky warm puddle of a horror scene only a demon could imagine. The wickedest realization a mother could face. Too tragic, it's distant to me, to most. She soaked in it. This is the news, the call which ended my teenage years. 

 From then on egg shells would be on my feet whenever I saw porthos(mat).  The once solid brawler of a trusted companion and musketeer.  The last time he came over, he told me accidently about the people that live in the woods behind his trailer. He sees them out his window and they wear top hats and trenchcoats. That is all I got out of him before he rushed off after a few assurances to him that they aren‚Äôt real.  Describing his illness to him for the 1000 time and asking if he‚Äôs been taking his meds, I get frustrated.  He hasn‚Äôt been and telling someone they are wrong, when they have seen these people night after night with their own eyes is futile. Why couldn‚Äôt he have seen or heard god? Those types of voices shaped mankind up to the present.


 So train kids and smart phones.  I now understand why my father lost all his friends. They are carried away, for good or worse, rarely do we have a say in the matter. Shatter. Scatter. Disintehrating matter. Crack boom. Lightning, thunder. Whish, zoom, boom boom. Crack. Energy equals matter. My friends, humorously in the past, tragic in the future. My friend's, he's a mad hatter.  

So that carrying away, the river current you can't stop, I guess
  Its quite poetic really.  In a disparaging hopeless, my best friend now chills with violent delusional people way.  Time, life, and fate makes me imagine us akin to those ants who are caught in a quick storm. 

Stuck in a puddle trying to get out and the puddle becomes a stream as every rain drop acts like another day, we are the ants, the puddle is time and eventually we surrender to the current ending up where we belong.  Feeling we belong where we dry up is the eternal struggle -cycling generation to generation, never able to leave advice, not even information, for death brings only speculation. Coarse whispers in loved one's ears.  Family legends and next world GPS coordinates. Regrets advice and apologies, voices in the fog like Whisps  of spindly dust particles we wipe away every spring. Carrying our laughs, our twinkle, too precious, too useless.  Vibrations of information Bound to ever teasingly float by us, through us, and through our grasp. Always on the tip of your tongue, and some days, I hope I know where those words came from.

I've scored morphine sulphate and have been taking 200 - 300mg a day this past week. While it doesn't have the punch of oxy, it has given me a moderate, euphoric high that oxy seems to have lost with me.

I usually take between 80mg of oxy (minimum) up to about 180mg a day, and have been for months. I probably average 120mg a day, and I dose strictly after work (over a 4 hour period).

My connect can only offer me methadone for the time being -10mg pills and I'm about to get 30mg off him. Not that I'm interested, but I have to work and cannot deal with chronic WD right now.

So, for someone who's never done methadone before, can I expect to get high with that sort of tolerance? It's that or nothing, so at best it'll keep WD at bay for 36hrs, but I wouldn't mind catching a nice buzz, especially because I'm paying $50 for it.

For example, I get a nice warm high off 200mg morphine sulphate taken orally, even though the oxy equivelant of 120mg is barely noticeable for me now. I firmly believe that rotating opiates allows you to catch a high that you wouldn't get with your main DOC in equal conversions.

I'm wondering if the same applies to methadone seeing as the metabolite is different to oxy (which converts to oxymorphone) and morphine (which is the metabolite). I'm not even sure what methadone metabolises to, other than it is a full agonist with a crazy long half life.

Can anyone comment on the methadone high for someone who has a moderate to high oxy/morphine opiate tolerance? Will 30mg do the trick or should I get another 10-20mg?",1529907089.0

Now To save making two posts, I just encountered one of   those veins that are popped out, look ready for action, strong flow, but always fool you into missing..as in, fully registered, push in a little, backs up, still registered, yet you'd have to force it in. That makes thr littler veins near burn. 

Dk if it's thrombosis or what, it's not scar tissue and only happens to a few big ones. Akin to your blood having a secret tunnel yet your shot registers, then backs up with no where to go. Doesn't feel like your missing til you try and force it in.. Sometimes it seems to travel the wrong way, very locally tho. After damming, still pulling blood, it'll maybe Burn real quick telling me enough to find another dermal dope slide.  Its not hitting an artery, I know 100%

The missed part of the shot also absorbs like a fully successful shot there too... Always making me come back tricking me again. So its odd, frequent enough to ask about but still mysterious,  Lmk if veteran slam dunk contest winners know the answer....

More concisely, veins that register strongly, dam up, yet still are drawing, but obviously not going through the veins? Missed portions absorb more because its on top of a vein obviously, but it's stronger than that. Slowly injecting brings same result. Only on large veins.

for those who are unaware tc is a video chat platform that while not perfect, seems to work well for phones and browsers alike. this room is for hanging out, listening to music, and specifically harm reduction so no one has to use alone. it is unaffiliated with r/opiates and its moderators and has its own rules and etiquette. here are the revised and updated rules:  

1) don't do any sort of -isms, it's just not cool and i run a leftist room. your opinions are welcome but no personal attacks or nasty stuff about groups of people. if you want to be rude, get personal, there's plenty of stuff to say about people without going for low-hanging fruit.  

2) don't make obnoxious noises over the mic, or play music over the chat. the bitrate for the sound channel is like 4, everything sounds like crap unless it's played through the built-in youtube player.  

3) don't dox anyone or take pictures or record the chat, this is a place people come to feel comfortable doing various things and anything that violates privacy results in an instant ban.  

4) guests must pick a unique username. no lurking allowed because people stalk people and shit. aside from these, just don't be rude or a douche.

so over the past 2-3 years I have always felt the need to be high on something before I sleep. whether that was weed, alcohol, pills in my parents cabinet or something. then 10 months ago I discovered kratom. I was headed on the right path. I was smoking weed occasionally, and taking kratom every day and night to sleep. I didn't know much about kratom and its withdrawals so now here I am, trying to get off that. Then, about 3 months ago from now, right around a year long breakup, I snorted heroin which I thought was oxy from a trusted friend.. the heroin was white and didnt feel much different than oxy. I wasnt told what it was until a couple weeks later. anyways, now from that time to now, I have been using more and more. it started occasionally (1-2 times a week, 1-2 bags), now to 6-7 days a week. this past week, it has gone from maybe 1-3 bags everyday or every other day,, to several bags a day (3-5bags). I only ever snorted.

Well now, I am discovering that this is a problem. the cravings are fucking strong, the withdrawals I get are from the kratom I believe, because I dont get any physical ones or anything out of the norm. just depressed, runny nose, restless legs and other cold like symptoms. nothing out of the norm from my kratom withdrawals. so now I have another problem on my hands.

I need to stop this before its too late. I dont want to talk to my parents or really any friends, besides one person I can trust and understands from past benzo addiction.. but would much rather not. 

guys I'm scared and dont know what to do. when I'm on it, I always tell myself this is it (especially these past 3 days). I would always tell my friend like this is it, Im done. then when I'm off, the cravings, minor withdrawals kick in and after a long day at work, I end up buying a half usually. sometimes a bun.. I need the willpower. I need the focus on other things its just so hard, which is why I came here because I know most of you's can relate to me.

any feedback, criticism, questions to understand the situation more would be very appreciated. I know I am headed down the wrong path and just like any other user, we never think we'd be in this situation ever in our lives, until it happens... it happened so fast.

would anyone recommend treatment, me to stop taking everything cold turkey? stop h cold turkey, and continue kratom then taper? taper off all my substances? I love all of you and this community dearly and don't have anyone I can really talk to nor do I want to do that, yet.. thank you. take care everybody <3",1529892579.0
8tmuw4,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8tmuw4/discussion_thread_on_recovery_via_maintenance/,87,https://redd.it/8tmuw4,chasingd0pamine,Discussion thread on recovery via maintenance using self acquired tools,"*edit: hi guys, this thread is currently stickied as you can see. it is the first post of a an idea us mods are pitching for hosting discussion threads here on various topics from using to getting clean and all points in between. this one as you can see is on maintenance drugs, with a focus on using them successfully and manly focusing on doing so without medical/professional help or your own prescription. doing it the proper way isnt possible for everyone, but it is possible so want to share tips on safely and effectively self medicating thru maintenance. i encourage anyone to add any experience in success or failure with maintenance using the various methods, mainly experience with the DIY approach of using subs, methadone, kratom etc you obtained on your own. AMA about this at all no matter how personal your question may be, messsage me privately anytime if you wish, and please comment on this post with your experiences and leave feeback. sticky until the end of monday for visibility, heres the first step of a testrun of an extensive project weve got in the works for* r/opiates\*. :)\*

\---

I wanted to start a thread for people to share experiences with recovery using maintenance tools acquired without professional help. I see people mention self acquiring subs for dry times, but never have really seen anyone share long-term success using self acquired maintenance drugs. What I DO see constantly, is people desperate for help but lacking the resources for whatever reason. there is too much misinformation on maintenance drugs and success using them, i aim to eliminate that in any way possible. this is not professional advice but each claim i make is backed up either with firsthand experience or citable references ive found researching, this is not one size fits all so wlecome discussion or questions. please dont make any informed claims as facts, seeking a solid discussion and want this thread to be something to link people to in the future when questions come up daily about this.

personal background: I am a chronic pain patient and massive, chronically relapsing heroin addict. I have been clean from dope for 45 days self medicating suboxone illicitly obtained. Been on opiates daily for nearly a decade, using heroin for two years, suboxone is the only thing that has ever kept me away from full agonists. I have never been prescribed, cant afford to currently, and want to share my recovery experience having to cut corners to self medicate with the medication that has saved my life. I will share, and am open to answer any comments (or PM discussion is welcome, too) regarding:

\- advice on a short term suboxone taper

\- advice on long term suboxone maintenance

\- advice on suboxone doses relative to your specific habit

\- advice on different routes of administration less often discussed

\- also have advice for days on using kratom

I invite everyone to share experiences with maintenance methods outside of sub/methadone clinics and without professionals. I will add that you have to REALLY want to be clean in order to make this work on your own, because you will have to cut a lot of corners at times. But it IS possible even when it seems like its not and you are lacking traditional tools. I will touch on price range for suboxone both via prescription and via the streets; using atypical ROA to get the most out of buprenorphine; stabilizing on a dose as low as possible but yet reasonable; and I welcome any questions at all. *I cant speak on methadone as it is harder to obtain especially on a consistent basis illicitly. I personally reccommend people try kratom or suboxone before methadone, especially if youre lacking the funds to do so ""properly"". Anyone with experience on self medicating methadone feel free to share though*

**I want this to be a thread we can refer people to in the future that want help and dont know where to start without professional/medical help. Note: I am not a doctor, just a recovering junkie/chronic pain patient who wants to help other people in a bind with recovery using maintenance tools.**

**summary of my specifics and where im at:** When I ended my last run, my habit was using midwest beans of heroin/fent (beans are 100 mg capsules of dope), ranging from minimum 5 beans a day to 15+ sometimes. Mostly snorted, but injected 3-5 times a week or so. In the past I usually used the bernese method to induce, this time I waited til about 28 hours and then induced normally 1mg at a time. I get my subs on the street for $10/8mg. I use half a strip per day. I trade pills or even food stamps to my sub dealer when I have no cash. But speaking cash wise, I self acquire 15 8mg strips per month and it costs me a total of $150, or $5 per day. I never have 150$ at once, and I never buy more than a week or two worth at a time (though I urge you to if you can).

**Price range:** In the name of harm reduction to share info on resources in diff areas (broadly), as a mod **I will allow mention of states but** ***DONT COMMENT ANY MORE SPECIFIC***. First I am sharing street pricing. and AFAIK on dark net they go for like $20 or so for 8mg. I am in new york and they run $10 per 8mg here. I know that in tennessee they go for up to $25 per 8mg and Ive never heard of more than this. AFAIK, thats typical depending on region and how many you buy at a time. Ive never seen them for less than $10each, or more than $25 each. Ive heard of people selling fragments of a strip at a time, accepting trades as payment, etc if you cant afford to lay out lumps at a time. As far as clinics around me, they go as low as $100 a month cash for the visit. Uninsured, I had my pharamacy give me a run down on the prescription cost uninsured, using the biggest availabel discount plan or coupons. I inquired on 60x8mg, as this is the most commonly scripted amount per month. For the name brand Suboxone films, it would be $570. Zubsolv (5.7mg bupe sublingually equiv. 8mg) would be about the same. Subutex (buprenorphine sans naloxone) would be over $700. The cheapest option is generic buprenorphine tablets at $180. These numbers are all based on 16mg per day for 30 day cost, in my area in new york. This is on the cheaper end! Streets are flooded, dark net has them, and for legal/proper acquiring there are some sub doctors that are not horribly expensive out of pocket, and for pain people Pain Management doctors are starting to push bupe as well.

**Dosing/ROA:** I cut the supply needed in half by opting out of sublingual dosing. Sublingual bioavailability is around 30&#37;, intranasal like 48&#37;, rectal 56&#37;, IV 100&#37;. DO NOT bang your fucking subs people! But you \*can\* stretch and get the most out of buprenorphine  by snorting or plugging. I personally plug my suboxone every day, 4mg per day. My dose is the sublingual equivalent of about 8mg a day, but by plugging I can spend half the money on half the amount of strips by doubling the BA I would get taking as prescribed. I encourage textbook def. ""abusing"" drugs when it is for good reason! I spend $5 a day, even at $25 a strip this would be $12.50 a day. This holds me and keepps me stable coming off  a decent heroin/fent habit. Feel free to tell me your current habit and Ill help you find roughly the dose you could realistically stabilize on. Suboxone is WILDLY overprescribed, but I am grateful for that because the streets are flooded and this  allows me a shot at recovery.

I realize my specific regimen is not one size fits all, but having pretty extended knowledge (both through experience and through researching extensively) on ballpark dosing, on the most painless taper possible, on ROAs and dosing equivalents etc. There is a ton of misinformation on buprenorphine out there. You probably dont need 16mg/day. 90&#37; of horror stories coming off of suboxone youve heard are due to improperly tapering and jumping at stupid amounts. There are ways to dose it to make it better for pain. Its possible to induce even if you swear you just \*cant\* make it to 24 hours. You can do it on your own if you want it. Ask me anything on suboxone or kratom, message me if you want to discuss privately, share your experience with maintenance that you did on your own without professional/medical help. Lets shut down the incorrect info, discuss tips weve learned, share what hasnt worked, and give hope to people lacking tools and resources.

**\*\*\* OFFICAL DISCLAIMER you can mention your state in this context for harm reductions sake but no more specific, anyone using this thread to try to source in any way is getting banned\*\*\***

TLDR - my experience self medicating with maintenance to treat addiction and chronic pain, ask me anything at all on my experience or input, and share your experiences in the comments. looking for a helpful thread for discussion and information on a topic not discussed often enough. disclaimer im a mod and not welcoming rule breaking of any kind in this post.",1529892365.0

Our conversations are much deeper then drug talk or unintelligent tough guy dick measuring. After running errands I gave him a call to see if he wanted to get some food. Pulled up to this BBQ joint in the hood (best soul food in the city) and grabbed some burnt tips, collard greens and grits. He opted for ribs and slaw. This is the guy who told me i need to quit doing heroin because its going to kill me. Call each other by our real names not our hustle names. He's struggling as a new father and asked for pointers cause im good with kids. Talked about the socioeconomic disparity in the black neighborhood he lives in and how it creates dependency on welfare. Discussed how disenfranchised the youth of today feels and how it probably ties directly into the opiate epidemic. Thats why he became a dboy, he wasn't making enough flipping burgers to support his mom, his sister and his girlfriend and child. Ive asked him before if he feels bad that people have overdosed from his drugs. Today he said to his knowledge nobody has died but when people disappear  he loses sleep over it. He himself has never done heroin and asked me how hard it was to stop and explained its impossible for some people. We're close enough since he knows im solid and not a snitch that i finally asked where the fuck he gets all the h from (not names or locations obviously just like if its a cartel or what). He gets actual heroin not fentanyl. He said his guy is an old OG Gangster Disciple and is the one one who gets it from the cartel and only once has he seen the cartel guy and he said it was an unsuspecting hispanic guy driving a cheap car. Apparently a key of heroin is around $30k of uncut grey/beige raw. The coolest part was when we got the check he said nah nigga i got you man cause lets be honest i've given him thousands of dollars and he also tipped really well. gave the waitress a 20 and a bunch of ones on a meal together that only costed 20.

After 10 years of usage, a single fuck up resulted in John‚Äôs parents finding out his secret and creating major hurdles in his recovery.","They found out. About him of course, but not me. I‚Äôm still in the clear...for now.

2 weeks ago John‚Äôs crazy ass went on a vacation with his father and brought ten 40 mg OPs instead of dope. (For reference, he usually uses ~20 blue bags a day.) Perhaps he might‚Äôve been able to take the hit of a few sweaty days if he weren‚Äôt hiking-the-fucking-Grand-Canyon. But let‚Äôs be honest, this was a stupid move.

Anyway, I did what any good fianc√© would do and I shipped him enough dope to hold him over. My biggest regret is roaming the hallmark isle of the drug store and refusing to settle for anything less than the most perfect, lovey-dovey, ‚Äúmy ‚ù§Ô∏è is wherever you are,‚Äù card to ship it in. Sure, I changed my name and address on the return section of the envelope and didn‚Äôt leave a single finger print to trace it back to me, but this made for a lot of explaining when his father intercepted the package...The one thing we didn‚Äôt think of. 

John‚Äôs parents are your typical preppy, middle class, divorced white folks who drink a few too many glasses of wine at dinner and get a bit carried away with judging other people on Facebook. 

‚ÄúHEROIN?! You‚Äôre going to DIE if you use even one more time!‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhat a terrible father you are!‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt love us, or you would just stop.‚Äù

 ...Just some of the cringey things they‚Äôve said that mirror every naive Heroin parent‚Äôs thoughts and fears. 

They don‚Äôt understand the concept of withdrawals. They don‚Äôt understand the difference between blowing/smoking/shooting...etc. They don‚Äôt understand the similarities in chemical makeup between H and prescribed opioids. All they know is what is portrayed by the media; which is that prescription pills are dangerous, but Heroin is a certain death sentence. They regurgitate this stigma like a bulimic teenage girl purging her 1st and last meal of the day.

Of course there is so much I wish I could tell them to ease their minds, even in the slightest....that John knows what he is doing, he knows what he is getting, that it goes through several other people before it reaches him, that he‚Äôs deathly afraid of needles and would never shoot up, that he is not out on the street copping from strangers with heavy Fentanyl or Carfentanyl cuts, that he is functional, that he is still a wonderful father, that he has been trying desperately to kick the habit and was planning on taking some time out of work in the coming months. 

Not that they would even believe me if I did tell them any of these things. These minor reassurances would only serve to incriminate me‚Äîif not as a fellow user, than as a (sic) ‚Äúremarkable enabler.‚Äù 

Predictably, when John returned from his vacation, his parents sent him straight off to detox and then rehab. He did surprisingly well at first, completing his stay at detox and getting through his first full day at rehab (the rehab he was sent to was a separate holistic facility, about 45 mins away.) Problem was, he was not fully detoxed and now he was stuck at a place that did not have the means to help him. (They wouldn‚Äôt even give him a god damn Advil!) 

So like any other miserably sick addict would consider in his circumstances, he bailed. 

I had warned his parents about the shit-quality of the detox they sent him to. (Little did they know, I had been there just weeks before and failed miserably due to their inadequate treatment.) I begged them to choose another place, but they didn‚Äôt want any part of it.  Some former addict with a certificate in addiction counseling told them this facility was the best in the state and they believed him. John‚Äôs parents were all-knowing experts and I was just a foolish little girl, or so they thought. At this point they weren‚Äôt even really talking to me, actually. They believed I either sent the drugs myself or that he was cheating on me. Both theories made things incredibly awkward for me. 

When they finally came around and decided to include me in the conversation, the first thing they asked was who the woman was whose name was on the card John received. I told them I assumed it was a woman named ‚ÄúJane‚Äù he used to work with who was head over heels in love with John. I suggested that perhaps he used her weakness for him to get what he needed. A stupid excuse, but it seemed to work for now. 

Much to my surprise, his father was on a witch hunt to track down our dealer. (What the fuck, man.) I‚Äôll never understand his desire to want to destroy someone else‚Äôs life. As if it will somehow save his son.

Everyday for the last two weeks, I‚Äôve received  a call from one of our friends informing me that John‚Äôs Dad called to interrogate them about tracking down ‚ÄúJane‚Äù or whoever his dealer is.

Unironically, our state just passed Kristen‚Äôs law, (which for those who are unfamiliar with it, could sentence dealers to life in prison if caught). Mind you, our dealer is also a user like so many others and could use help and support far more than the kind of draconian punishment John‚Äôs father is seeking to charge him with. This guy is the kind of person who would hang himself if he were sentenced to more than a week in prison. He could never ever handle punishment this severe. 

I cannot put into words how angry this garbage legislation makes me. I called and lobbied for weeks trying to prevent this bill from becoming law, but sadly, too many politicians in our state are more concerned with appealing to the vulnerable and naive families of OD victims and getting re-elected, than listening to every god damn substance abuse professional and organization within a 50 mile radius of us who testified against it. It doesn‚Äôt help that this is a mid-term election year, (but I digress.) 

When John left rehab, his parents called me immediately and told me I wasn‚Äôt to let him come home. Um, what? Not going to happen. They were utterly PISSED when I refused to do so. His mom responded by calling me a ‚Äúremarkable enabler,‚Äù making (technically semi-accurate) assumptions about my past knowledge of his use and going as far as saying ‚ÄúFuck you!‚Äù to me, for refusing to adopt their ‚Äútough love‚Äù approach with John.

Whoa. Okay, so maybe I kind of get it. You‚Äôre both frustrated and need someone to blame and I am an easy target‚Äîmuch like the mystery dealer whose life you want to destroy. Somehow that still doesn‚Äôt make this any less hurtful and frustrating. 

I tried my best to explain to them that in my ‚Äúexperience‚Äù in dealing with addicts (my sister and mom are both addicts and I happen to treat addicts for a living), a more compassionate and shame-free approach is much more effective. I told them we should be fostering an environment that allows John to feel comfortable talking to us and that we shouldn‚Äôt be angry with him for leaving‚Äîinstead we should hear him out and do our best to provide positive reinforcement and remind him why sobriety is worth pursuing. 

(But hey what do I know, anyway. It‚Äôs not as though I‚Äôm an actual addict. üò≥) They argued that my approach has failed from the beginning‚Äîwhich actually isn‚Äôt true since I haven‚Äôt made a solid effort since MY tough love phase years ago and prior to picking up the habit, myself. The argument was going nowhere so I ignored the texts that followed, which involved nothing more than the two of them berating me for being so ‚Äúfoolish and naive.‚Äù 

When John came home that night, I watched as he blew 15 bags at once. (What the actual fuck, John. I‚Äôm trying to justify your irresponsibility in my head, but you‚Äôre not making it easy.) 

He looked up at me when he finished and saw me start to tear up. ‚ÄúYou have to go back. Your parents are going to hate me forever if I don‚Äôt prove to them right now that I can‚Äî‚Äú before I could even finish my sentence, his phone went off. It was his mother telling him ‚Äúnot to listen to me‚Äù and that I ‚Äúdon‚Äôt have his best interest in mind.‚Äù

That god damn text hurt us both more than it should have. ‚ÄúI know,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut let‚Äôs go get some food right now. I‚Äôm starving and I miss you so much.‚Äù 

He clung to me like a toddler, that night. We talked all night about our hopes and dreams for the future. We cuddled and cried and laughed until the sun came up...

He knew he needed to take advantage of this opportunity to get clean. After all, his parents were throwing down $15k for him to go to a top-notch rehab. And despite all of the weird holistic/anti-western medicine treatments they practiced there, he believed it was a pretty damn good facility, considering the typical standards of this industry. 

But first, he would need to go through detox again. Bleh! I think I hated the idea of him leaving me again more than he hated the idea of having to suffer through withdrawals again. But with 10 years under his belt and 5 under mine‚Äîwe knew what we were in for. Suffering is simply unavoidable with this drug.

The next morning he re-packed his bags, we did some laundry together, grabbed a quick breakfast and I drove him off to another detox facility.

His parents were shocked to hear that he was going right back‚Äîso shocked actually that they apologized for their less-than-kind remarks towards me. It felt good to be the one to tell them.

Today is day 3 of John‚Äôs detox. I went to see him yesterday. He was visibly ill, but pushing through without med assistance. I think this time will be a bit easier for him since he did most of the work last week, prior to his single relapse. But we‚Äôre not out of the water yet and won‚Äôt be for some time.

As for me, I‚Äôm cutting back by 1 bag a day‚Äîwhich sucks worse than it sounds‚Äîbut the plan is to taper down just enough to be able to pull off a 72 hr cold turkey detox in a few weeks when the tension with his family has died down. 

Keep us in your thoughts, y‚Äôall.

We can‚Äôt afford to keep dancing on the edge of this cliff...as beautiful as the view is, we have too much to live for.

Didn't even drink until my career exploded (in a good way). First drink I had was on my way to an event in Los Angeles, coming from a small town on a small island in Scotland this was just so wild for me. I had a vodka and coke and thought it was rancid and ruined the flavour of the coke.

Years later I get some chronic pains showing up. The doc gives me cocodamol. I joke to friends about it being a ""hardcore superdrug"". It's fun though... one night when a friend's dad died I went on a walk up a hill back in Scotland. Well okay a mountain that overlooked the rest of the world below. I was just stood up there taking photos thinking that even though my friends event is sad that at least he got to live a long life and got to produce good kids. I got back home and watched a bluray film called Nausica. Life felt good.

But of course that feeling is fleeting. I wanted more. Told the doc my pain was getting worse and was put on Tramadol. Now this sucked. It was providing so much reward and happiness in my brain that I stopped doing fun stuff. My fame was getting lost but I felt okay through it all. Ho hum! But then I ended up in a deep depression. I got out of it months later.

Nowadays I buy Codeine in large quantities from online pharmacies. I usually have 1-8 days worth in a single day. It's a bit crazy and even no matter the dose it doesn't get my high as it once did. I've been thinking about changing to a different medication but it's too hard to (semi legally) get oxycodone and its friends here. And the docs don't give it out either. Like... the route is Cocodamol, Codeine, Tramadol, DHC, morphine! I think end of life people can get Fentanyl. Always wondered what that's like.

These days I just live off my royalties from my previous life and spend too much on these weak drugs. I keep wanting to quit them. I quit Trams cold turkey once and oddly found it not too difficult... I just reminded myself that the only reason I felt bad was externally chemically induced and it would be okay soon. Weirdly easy like I say... But now I find I can not take codeine and everything is okay. Before I went all in I used to buy Loperamide as a replacement and found that worked absolute wonders. No kidding! It lasted longer than codeine, was more mentally happy. Just much better except for that super long peak waiting time. 5 hours for me! 

I keep wanting to come back to earth. I'd like to buy a ranch or something in America and be a liberal chap out there in the countryside/mountains running a bunch of studios where people can come in and create whatever they wanted. Or abandon everything fun and exciting and become a house renovator.

My partner supports me through all this. They're a great person. Totally straightedge (except in the bedroom) but also understands that my body is in a lot of physical pain and is more or less okay with as things are. But if I ever told them I wanted to quit they'd be there the whole way for me too.

I guess I'm rambling because I have no one else to talk to this stuff about. Everyone thinks I'm this wholesome person. I guess I am but theres also the fact that 1) everything hurts and 2) I get help with that. I feel like I'm retired now. I'm halfway to retirement age but have decided to take everything so slow and leisurely. I might even take a nap now. No, I will.",1529860695.0

One, I was thinking about my previous birthday. I had money guaranteed to come to me in a card, enough to buy dope as well as components and supplies for my hobbies and bike.

The thing is, I arranged for the middle to expect my call the following afternoon right after work. Though, I was also hoping that I'd wake up for work at 6AM and have the card and cash waiting for me. That would've allowed me to get the ball rolling that much earlier. I was owed half a bun the night before, so I squaffed it all up because I couldn't wait even though I could physically wait. 

&nbsp;

So then my family member who was giving me money, was up really late and went to bed not long before I woke up. So was just hoping that when I get off work nine hours from the time I woke up, that the card would be waiting for me. 


Now of course, I knew it would suspicious to come home from work, receive the card and money and then dart out the door again. If there were a any lingering doubts about me not being on the straight and narrow -- this would affirm such doubts.


&nbsp;


Thus I came up with a cover story which wasn't completely untrue. Said that I needed to buy something wholesome from a store that closes an hour after I get off work. My family member says, ""I'll give you a ride you if you need one, there's a chance of rain."" Well, I can bike to the shop to get the part I need, and it's good to have the bike with me to take measurements of the part I'm replacing but I had to think.. to take the ride or not. It would possibly look less suspicious, but would also impose delays into the whole process of procuring dope. 

&nbsp;

In the end I just had to play it by ear when I got off work and not be obvious in my true actions. Took a few minutes extra to measure my old parts before departing to go to the store for the new parts. Also warned my middle during the work day about the liklihood of delays on my end but that my order was a certainty, just a matter of when. 

That's funny, so many times when I've been told, ""it's just a matter of when"", I was being lied to by the likes of Cliff. Oh well, my middle knows I'm a straighter shooter than that.

&nbsp;

**BTW the middle that gave me [""Jewish"" spices in place of dope](https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8sn777/requesting_help_in_identifying_kosher_seasoning/?ref=share&ref_source=link) gave me real dope two nights later.* That was two nights ago for that matter. He called me at 3am and said he had it. I was surprised but glad. The only thing that annoyed me was the fact that I ordered that shit on a Wednesday afternoon and was now receiving it on a Friday night into Saturday morning at 3am. Doing dope that late fucks up one's sleep. Furthermore he didn't give me a five bags like I paid for, he gave me four and said he'll give me the fifth one later or in a couple of days.

Naturally did some right away and saved two for the following day of work. Since I took a nap right after work, I was able to take a sub when but I should've gotten my shit on Wednesday when I ordered it.


Of course that last bag... he could only give it to me when he middles for someone else or buys some for himself. Not worth my time to keep asking.

It's about a biologist who encounters a physicist working as a bagger for Walmart, his name is Johann Ritter. Turns out he was born in 1776 and has attained immortality, though the exact means through which he did so remain unknown. It's narrated in three different styles: protagonist (contemporary German), physicist (pompous, purple 18th century German) and the narrator, who happens to be the Devil himself! It's a Faustian type deal through which immortality was awarded to Ritter. Great book,9/10.

Also reading Suttree, by Cormac McCarthy of Blood Meridian and The Road fame. It's hilarious, biblical, poetic, EVERYTHING. Read it! Amazing prose, I've heard it described as a Southern Ulysses or a ""doomed Huckleberry Finn"", which is spot-on.

1) don't do any sort of -isms, it's just not cool and i run a leftist room. your opinions are welcome but no personal attacks or nasty stuff about groups of people. if you want to be rude, get personal, there's plenty of stuff to say about people without going for low-hanging fruit.  

2) don't make obnoxious noises over the mic, or play music over the chat. the bitrate for the sound channel is like 4, everything sounds like crap unless it's played through the built-in youtube player.  

3) don't dox anyone or take pictures or record the chat, this is a place people come to feel comfortable doing various things and anything that violates privacy results in an instant ban.  

4) that's basically it, just don't be a douche.

8te1qc,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8te1qc/scramble_speedballs/,13,https://redd.it/8te1qc,Lillizsomd,Scramble speedballs,"So, I've recently fallen in love with speedballs, and I live in the only area in the US that gets scramble caps. For anyone who doesn't know, scramble is dope/fent mixed with...something...and put into gel caps for either 6 or 10 bucks. Two 6 caps or one 10 cap is a single serving. 

Well, the scramble is all I can reliably find in the area. And on the upper side of the binto an irritating issue trying to mix them in the syringe. No matter what I do, when I put the two together, they solidify somewhat! I've tried heat, no heat, mixing them in the same spoon, in separate spoons, pulling up the dope first, and pulling up the crack first. I don't know what else to try at this point.

So what I'm wondering, science people of r/o, is what ingredient in these two conglomerations is causing this (I assume) chemical reaction? I'm kinda guessing it's the baking soda in the crack reacting with whatever the inactive ingredient in the scramble is, which I don't know what it is. It apparently used to be quinine back in the day, but I doubt it's that any more. Also-I'm using grape kool-aid powder to break down the crack. 

It's still somewhat injectable even when it clumps up, I did and it went in fine and just left the solids at the bottom of the syringe after I shot the rest. Still, I can't imagine it's overly great to be shooting something with particulates like that in it. So, if anyone knows why it's doing that, I would also greatly appreciate if someone could help me fix that issue. 

Damn this got long, can y'all tell I'm speedballin'?? 

Tl:Dr- Love speedballs. Can only get scramble and crack. Mixing them makes it semi-solidify in the syringe or on the spoon. Why and how do I fix it?",1529798873.0

And holy shit, am i thankful i did.

So it was a unique day for me, since we were recording our debut EP, so i  decided i should do codeine a bit earlier than scheduled because i was  in the studio recording shit and i couldn't concentrate to save my life.  I was planning to leave the codeine for a party i was having later that  evening, but since we were way off schedule i decided to skip it and  just take the codeine to make the most left of my recording session. I  filtered out about 1600mg of codeine (had some old leftover residue i  refiltered + 1500mg of regular pharm grade codeine w/APAP) downed 20mg  of citerizine and drank the codeine.

And holy shit

The  trip was intense, not as intense as the one i had from H, but needless to say - i was swaying left, right and could barely keep my  balance for a few minutes. I felt a bit of itchiness from the histamine  release, but nothing else much noteworthy - just an intense, euphoric,  pleasurable high which left me zoned out into music for a good 3 hours.

Even  my band member asked if i didn't get bored recording the same riff over  for 3 hours to get the ""perfect take"". Hah, got close. Was one of the  most productive studio sessions in my life.

And  before you mention placebo - i didn't expect anything, i was kinda  expecting it to be less intense than it was. Words cannot describe how  that 300mg improved my high. Maybe it's because of the dexamethasone i  took 2 days ago? But it couldn't have been that, since i took codeine  the day before this trip (first day of recording and setting up amps) so  my tolerance was pretty high, although i only took about 900mg and it  left me cranky and unproductive afterwards.

TL;DR the trip was way more intense than the usual codeine 1200mg i was doing. So, yeah. I disspelled the myth for myself and i will now be upping my dose of codeine to 1500mg. The high was so intense - i want to break my schedule of once a week and do it again soon, and that fucking scares me.",1529793229.0

---

I once had the best moment of pure euphoria on the aforementioned railroad bridge after a serene walk with my best friend. (so long dude. I drove you away for good). I‚Äôm sure the fentanyl had little do with both, right? Yeah. Fucking right. The devil was inside my bones, but I felt better than I have ever felt. I felt invincible. I was the prototypical me, I created things. I was a master. I wrote poetry which would blow you away, and I didn‚Äôt even know where the words came from. I was applying for manual labor jobs, something I had never even tried or considered as a skinny ass emo/skater dude all my life. 

I was driving trucks even though just being in a car used to make me a nervous wreck. My family was happy for me. It looked like I had turned over a new leaf. I had stopped smoking pot, which was something I had done for years straight. It‚Äôs a possibility it made me lazier somewhat, I‚Äôm not denying that. When I quit I didn‚Äôt even do it on purpose, it was just that this other drug was so good nothing else mattered. Fuck coffee. Fuck weed. Fuck even eating real food, give me a fentanyl lollipop and some ice cream. That is all I ever craved food-wise was ice cream. It‚Äôs in a class of its own. (I‚Äôve seen my own father who is on the same drug eat gallons of the stuff. It‚Äôs really a spectacle.)

I woke up one morning and realized I felt too sick to even get out of bed and reach for my fent patches, I had hidden slyly hidden under my audio receiver. In retrospect, what kind of hiding place is that? (considering I have an audio nerd for a father). There was not much logic going through my head in this period. However, there were many songs in my head. I wrote ballads that seemingly were beamed down to me from the nether realm, because I don't know where the hell those words came from. The notes just slid off my fingers while playing guitar too. It felt like cheating. ‚ÄúNow I know...‚Äù, I thought, ‚Äúhow all those junky artists created such brilliant things.‚Äù I had discovered the cheat code to life, and it was incredible. 

At night though things took a turn, I became alone and trapped. When my company was gone, which was rare during this time, I would just nod out on the couch watching adult cartoons through the corner of my eye every 10 minutes when I could manage to open them. I was fucking strung out like hell. I had a nearly infinite supply of the strongest legal for human use, opiod on the market. I was chewing those damn patches like gum, and my friends must have thought I was insane when trying to explain. ‚ÄúOh it‚Äôs just a little pain patch, hehehe‚Äù‚Ä¶ What a joke. Somehow these friends stuck by me, for now. They didn‚Äôt realize the scope of what I had done to myself as I did. I had become a full-on opiod junky, and the worst part of it was I was completely aware of it. It isn‚Äôt like the naive old lady who goes to the doctor for Percocets and becomes dependent. She hasn‚Äôt studied the exact psychology/pharmacology that goes into addiction. I feel like it honestly made it worse that I understand why* I was hooked.‚ÄùAll this dopamine I‚Äôm lacking here without chemical influence‚Äù, and another, ‚Äúif only I weren't a treatment resistant chronic depression and anxiety case already before the junk‚Äù, all these justifications like this we have to continue using, they don‚Äôt mean shit at the end of the day when we lay our heads down yet again, an addict. 

One day my best friend and also roommate called me as he usually would around 7:30A.M. ‚ÄúHey bro, you ready?‚Äù It was time for one of our early morning classes at the community college we were now attending. God knows I already fucked up the whole university deal. I had just gotten out of sitting in a bathtub, trying to calm down my extreme lack of temperature regulation. Sometimes during withdrawal the few seconds of warm water are your only refrain from the pain and agony.

 I reluctantly agreed that I was in fact ready even though I felt like death on a stick. I was testing out how sick I would get without fentanyl today. My friend pulled up in a few minutes, and I got in the car. He asked me for a drink of my water. ‚ÄúWait, are you sick?‚Äù, he asked. My friend was a severe hypochondriac. ‚ÄúNo, it isn‚Äôt that kind of sick‚Äù, I assured him. ‚ÄúOh, well as long as you‚Äôre just dope sick...‚Äù Feeling like somewhat of a diseased leper didn‚Äôt seem to help my already unwell and agitated state. We drove out the loop of my blacktop drive, and I already had a bad feeling for what was to come.

We crossed the mountain via the great big interstate which connects our little rural village to the outside world. We are just simply a piss stop for the rest of the world, a cut off, isolated mountain town where everyone‚Äôs nosey about each other‚Äôs business, and the only actual businesses are pharmacies, Dollar Stores, and funeral homes. Oh, and churches of course. At least we do have God on our side... Except that we are all on doctored-ordered drugs (heroin isn‚Äôt huge here), beer or moonshine. I stare out the side of the passenger window at the beautiful mountains below and think how I used to get stoned on top of the hill right above this interstate and just stare down at nature. Man, I wish I could appreciate things of beauty now. Everything looks fucking grey, it‚Äôs all the same. That‚Äôs the worst part about drugs, and it‚Äôs the same with all of them for me (even antidepressants). They zap the color from life.

Finally, we pull into the exit. Now if you think my description of my town sounds shitty, this is worse. It is considered one of the poorest areas in the state and also the meth hotspot for our county. There is only one main road, and we drive it slowly as to not fall into the speed trap. I can feel my stomach starting to turn now as I cringe at the McDonalds sign above. ‚Äúhey bro, you want some mickey dees?‚Äù, my friend asks. ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù I say with a firmness I have never used before. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just eat my trail mix‚Äù. I brought some because I can‚Äôt go without breakfast ever, even while a junky. I scarf down some M&Ms and peanuts and raisins, while trying to calm my anxiety with the soft guitar on the radio, courtesy of The Shins. (I was the source for all my friend‚Äôs musical tastes, an expert in his eyes).

Now we are pulling into the school, and the dread is coming to a head. It floats up my stomach and feels like love butterflies in my chest except they are black and rotten. As we are walking in, I see this really cute girl that sits across from me in class. I smile at her as we both turn our heads back towards the front of the school. At this exact moment, it hits me. I have to fucking throw up and I have to do it right now. I‚Äôve heard this can happen in withdrawal though I have always had an iron stomach until today. I rush over to the curb, not more than 25 feet from the door (and my crush  at the time) and proceed to projectile vomit all over the crabgrass. Ah, that feels better. 

I wipe my mouth, and scoff it off as I walk inside and head to my class. My friend is simply shaking his head, and I still don‚Äôt know if that girl saw me. As I walk into the narrow corridors of the community college, I imagine just how mundane this really is. There must be hundreds of little schools that are built just like this, with as many mediocre classes and teachers too. Hey, it‚Äôs cheap.

I turn right into a door that appears the same as every other, and I‚Äôm in my class. I look at the teacher, and she immediately knows why we are late. These bloodshoot eyes tell stories. I ask her for a piece of gum in front of the entire class, heavily implying that I just threw up everywhere. She told us to just go home, and so we did. 

---

Some more months of this cycle go by, as I slowly fall out of going to my classes, and then literally start falling out of life. My habit has gotten worse, fast. I‚Äôm now wearing and chewing fent patches, and rarely leaving the house for any reason. My friend and roommate is sick of my shit, and gone back to his grandparents. 

It was around this time I considered trying to get clean ‚Äúfor good‚Äù. I flushed all the remaining patches I had in a fit of rage. After this event at school and last night, I‚Äôm over it. I should explain that I fell out for the tenth time probably on the couch one morning, around 6am, after being in my usual nod state for the entirety of the night. I woke up to Hank Hill saying ‚Äúdamnit Bobby‚Äù and suddenly having to puke, as I gazed at my red hot foot right next to the space heater where I wore a patch or two. I probably had a piece of another in my mouth as well.

Fuck, my stomach feels like daggers are poking into it again, as I run dizzy to the bathroom, marking the very first time in my entire using career, even with future IV use, that I ever threw up from any opiod dose. I have a natural tolerance to all drugs somehow. As I sit in my sweat-soaked boxers, hugging and staring down into the toilet, I saw my pink and green stomach bile (the result of eating nothing but fucking tootsie rolls in the last day).

Me being clean off Opanas and snorting dope and her being clean off shooting it. I‚Äôm 20 and she‚Äôs 18 anyways I ended up relapsing and her and my mom brought me to treatment. I did 60 days I called her everyday noticed something was off and she sounded fucked up. I didn‚Äôt want to accuse her because I love her and trusted her. She ended up telling me she was using I had my mom look up resources for her and got her into treatment ( she doesn‚Äôt have insurance) we come from very different backgrounds. She decided to go to sober living like a half hour away from me for a month. They took her on a scholarship. I was still in treatment and called her and things weren‚Äôt going the best,  she was drinking in sober living. Not judging her just saying and not answering my calls not saying I love you hanging out with dudes while I‚Äôm in treatment so we break up. I go home and don‚Äôt contact her for roughly two weeks fast forward to last night I call her. We both say we still love each other. She confesses she‚Äôs banging meth and dope. Also that she loves me but doesn‚Äôt want to fuck with my life because I‚Äôm doing well I don‚Äôt understand that but okay. Basically I‚Äôm scared to death for her I asked her if I could come take her out to eat and she said yes. But literally I‚Äôm just scared she‚Äôs going to die and I don‚Äôt know what to do.

For example this is my story. After I got out of the sober living, I moved into a new apartment with  one condition: that I get drug tested once a week. Fine whatever that‚Äôs life. Plus now I can smoke weed (drug test for the parents; piece of mind for their time/ the least I can do.)

Well, after about a month of doing the drug testing, I noticed pattern of some really lazy drug testing. So me being me I push it to the limit but I‚Äôm also freaking out because I‚Äôm taking a huge gamble here. What do I do? Well, all the research online regards to drugs in your system really emphasize the idea of being healthy and exercise. So that‚Äôs what I did; started right then and there. Thankfully I pass the test and I felt like a cheated death again. I attributed it to the exercise and eating. Every time I used after that I was extremely afraid of what might happen drug test thus the exercise and the eating; I‚Äôm kind of nut health-wise. Stop smoking. Took up yoga. Shit like that. My parents even acknowledge how good I was looking and started taking health tips from me the junkie.

Here is the kicker;I just found out that the tests I take are the new five panels! My DOC is oxy so even if I rolled in high I could have passed that shit. I got into shape and found a new hobby for nothing!

Cant get anything better than tapentadol maintaince and 20 5mg oxy rarely prescribed. Being young with nerve damage, 8 mental conditions. I could try to get into pain management but in aus its extremely hard being young with nerve damage from a bike crash which i didnt go to hospital for bc circumstances around it so not much documentation which makes it hard to get into. Then theres methadone for pain so i can actually function daily or oxy/h which are expensive and illegal which could put me in jail for 20 m. I appriciate medical use and rec abuse and im trying to find the best solution.

Tldr: chipping oxy and methadone for nerve damage and to function and get on with get into a high paying job. This is an oncoherant xan ramble but let me knoe whay ypu reckon. Methadone or weed and benzo script or go through hoops and get fuck all from pain management. but i just want to move on with life after abit of mental and physical trauma plus ptsd, gad, depression and mild bipolar(current diagnosis) n a few more things. Any one who can offer advice go for it. From aus btw and if you have a fair bit of know about pain mgmnt or meth/suboxone id love hear from you

Actual tldr: thank u xanax
Option 1. Get into pain Management some how and it give an honest crack to get reasonale xr meds for medical use
2. Go to a methadone clinic and get a decent dose for pain, find decent dose, get shit together then taper
3. Dmn

So I go to the needle exchange and one of my using buddies pops in and still goes through a dealer I used too a long time ago. So I took him to meet the guy, paid my buddy a pack of cigs and a tiny shot for reintroducing me. 

Spent $40 and got just short of a half a gram,  split it into two shots, did one and was pretty high but I only had one shot left so I picked up four clonopin 1mg and took them on the ride home. 

Get home, do my shot (around 2PM)  and my god I was ripped, my girlfriend had to even help me walk. So fucking amazing.  

Now for the bad part- I didn't realize it was fetsnyl so I was withdrawling bad around 4PM. I didn't know how I was going to get more becsuse I forgot to save that dealers number (even though I'm sort of glad I didn't becsuse even if the shits fire I prefer something with legs) 

Fast forward until night time

I was dope sick all mfing night,  shaking, sweating, can't sleep, puking. 

Dealer is out of town for FOUR DAYS I was like wtf am I gonna do? Other dealer wouldn't answer at all. ***fuck***

Then a random number texts me AT 4AM! saying ""Jay left me his stuff to sell""

I said can I come through now she said yes. 

I wake my girlfriend (who doesn't do dope at all so she wasnt happy). We lesve around 430AM and get their around 515.

The girl selling the shit was already waiting outside for me. Normally i pay $40 for a half but I got two half grams for $70 this time. 

Normally it takes me forever to find a vein so if I'm really sick ill muscle, but I found a little vein by my thumb and hi

Not the greatest stuff,  didn't have me nodding crsxy but it gave me that amazing eupboria, energy and my favorite part THE ITCHIES (not even sarcastic I loveee itching)

We came to get some water and a couple burgers, but me being the little idiot I was back then, decide I want to shoot up right there in my car, and Robert says he is also down to shoot right then and there. So I break off a piece of the beautiful tar, as black as a freshly paved road, shinny and almost clean looking, and I drop it onto the bottom of a Arizona Tea can. I mix it up using the plunger on the freshly opened syringe. Just stirring gently as the thick tar melted into the water. It didn‚Äôt take long, and when it was nice and mixed, I dropped my little piece of cotton into the dark liquid. I stuck the needle into the cotton, and sucked the liquid into the syringe. It was a beautiful golden brown liquid filling half of the 1 cc syringe. I was ready to rise up to heaven.. 

The veins in my arm are hard to raise, and I hated dealing with trying to tap into them. I also was lucky enough to not really scar, I was careful and never left easily visible track marks. For these reasons, I opted to use the veins in the back of my hand to tap into. They were close to the skin, and easily accessible. So, I have Robert wrap his hands right around my wrist, to act as a tie off. I grab the steering wheel of my Chrysler, and slowly slip the needle into the perfect little vein. I pulled back the plunger and saw the dark red blood flow into the syringe *yes!* I thought to myself, because I got it perfect on the first try. So I slowly push down the plunger, and have my friend release his grip as I do. Instantly I feel the warm rush, like a tidal wave, but instead of cold ocean water, it‚Äôs water that feels warm, and smooth, better than any thing you can imagine. I have had some crazy drug experiences, and some crazy orgasms, even both at the same time. But nothing I had ever experienced could match this rush. It was pure bliss, like being sucked into heaven and embraced by god himself, I had reached nirvana, the perfect shot, the perfect high, until it became too much. The rush didn‚Äôt stop, it didn‚Äôt peak, it became overwhelming..

Robert had to grab the syringe from me, and look at me asking if I was okay. All I could reply was ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I can handle this‚Äù I was not overdosing, I was still conscious and breathing, but the high was so intense I started to fade in and out of consciousness. Let‚Äôs not forget I was in my car, in a busy fast food parking lot, and now I was so intensely high I thought I was going to die. Suddenly I see two cops, male and female, walk right by the car. This female police officer was one of the toughest looking ladies I have ever seen. I was so relieved when they kept going and went inside of the building. Now from here is where my memory gets hazy..

I some how managed to drive (yes this was very stupid, I could have killed Robert and myself and I regret that I did this) to Roberts brothers apartment. We get there and he gets me inside and I immediately start to apologize and explain what is going on. They are actually very understanding, I think a little annoyed, but understanding. They told me I was just too high, and that I would be fine. This reassured me, but I was still feeling waves of extreme eyeball rolling euphoria, it was amazing, and scary as all hell. I ran to the bathroom and immediately throw up. I don‚Äôt make a mess thank god, but I throw up a lot. Once that stopped I went and sat down on a small couch they had in a side sitting area, at this point I start to nod off, and literally lose giant chunks of time. This is hard to explain so let me try..

I was sitting there, and my eyes would close, and i would suddenly wake up and it‚Äôs 15 minutes later. But it did not feel like I was just falling asleep or nodding off. It literally felt like I was dying and coming back to life. I know I wasn‚Äôt actually dying, but all that was going through my mind was that my heart is stopping, and this is going to be the thing that kills me. Well, after a couple of hours of this, I start to come down, and calm down. Once I am back to reality, and can grasp the fact that I had just done to much, and was too fucked up, I apologized to the brothers, and once sober promptly left and went back home. I swore to myself I would never do something like that again, that it wasn‚Äôt worth the risk and that was that..

..3 weeks later I had a needle in my hand, and once again felt the serene pleasure of the warm evening sea rolling over my body.

I don't want to overstep, I just want to make sure she's safe, so her being secretive doesn't make me feel much better about the situation. She's also mentionned wanting to try heroin so that's something else that makes me worry a little.

She's also underage if that changes anything. Idk. Maybe it's not that big a deal. I just want her to be safe.",1529745385.0

The elderly. Gary will be my neighbors alias. In the late 70 s til 98 any mandolin recorded for records as a studio musician or live as the outsider hired help was gary. 3 decades of desperate attempts to popularize the mandolin. Charlie Daniels, jethro tull, Bruce Hornsby, new riders of the purple sage. If you needed a mandolin player who didn't play bluegrass, he was your guy. Now i lift up his lawn mower and fix his deck. He still thinks 5 years ago was months ago, the last run in we had. He worked the music store for his musician friend. Gary was broke and lived in a camper when single.  Now all his money is in mandolins. Even when he retired, 35 thousand dollars he spent on  One mandolin. His wife paid the mortgage, Gary still had the same paint stained tennis shoes I remember in 2006. His wife chases me away after 5pm, Gary hides his vodka,here. 3 martinis before dinner, bed at 730 She says. She doesn't want him drinking. He was barely alive in the soul when I realized he was my neighbor. His wife was my least favorite of my mother's friends. Cunt is an understatement.  So we act like teenagers irking her uptightness. I bet she only danced at her wedding.  He always asks how my hands feel, that surgery must have had a long rehabilitation and physical therapy to play like  I was never injured.  If Gary could see better or remember daily, my tracks would be blatant too him. I'm learning jazz guitar. He's learning jazzy dead songs for me.  My work causes my other scratched skin I say. We play my originals and he noodles along. He talks about touring,  how he could arrange for bringing me along. That would be a dream come true, unfortunately, Gary's main musicians all have passed. He talks about doing open Mic nights, then always says the dog needs a bath that night. Last week he assumed his kid and I grew up together. I've never met him.  Always Remembering 15 minute long arrangements without sweat, forgetting the year the next moment. Gary prioritized his memory storage.  He's off his opiates now.   So I nod along to spare him explaining again. His wife knows my mom. She thinks I'm still young. She tells on me and tells my mother I smoke weed and drink.  Gary is letting me drink.  Gary doesn't smoke,  but his fingers do on those frets. Our little jam sessions are smoke shows, too bad no one is there too listen.  Some days I have to board the coke train to keep up.  We play any thing he can remember. His wife works up stairs doing cyber therapy sessions.  She's so rigid and uptight, we both always agree this here in the sun is bout as good as it gets. No therapy needed when u have this. That's the smirk Gary always has. That's why he doesn't need those opiates. I need his secret. Gary doesn't work or tour anymore, its been decades now. He was always the hired help. So many tour stories about wild parties and drugs mention He was left out. being married and only a drinker, not hip enough All his life he played rock and roll / country mandolin. Bluegrass is the main genre for that instrument. The masters like David grisman were so epic, He was stuck in his niche. No originals wrote, no hits.  He's damn content now that he has someone to jam with. So  my lyrics and chords are the songs.  78 and 2 months ago he had reserved to let go. could barely move. Now he's got color to him, not taking his opiates and out and about. Gary thinks I get scratched alot at work. His wife tells the truth, he doesn't buy it.  So when the sun is shining, my 80 year old best friend hangs with me on the porch. Drink martinis, we try and learn those bluegrass legends solos, play songs, and forget we both need opiates. He needs them for dieing, I need them to keep from wanting to die. Not suicidal, just not impressed. Open mics and occasional jams around the fire can't mask the taking. No giving, people take. Scum bag fiends who want something always, or girls who need attention. Jobs that are dead ends, jobs where promotions cause hostility and petty people threatened shit on you. Opiates. Keeping the monotony at bay. Here's to every one finding a 78 year old bff. He only wants me to play guitar, and pour another martini.  Its funny how a habit sets to pause on that porch, every where, and everyone else, dance for a few minutes then ask for what they need. Gary's my homie, and straight with me. ""What are ya waiting for? I'm dieng so lets get pickin"" .....I oblige him and realize I dont have a habit here on this porch.  I'm clean to him and this is all I need.

Things that help along the way.  Xanax is like gold. When you can‚Äôt sleep or when you‚Äôre just craving something it really helps. Also Constantly take 800 mg ibuprofen every 8 hours or whatever the bottle says. Drink plenty of water. If you‚Äôre into weed smoke plenty. Now this last one is going to sound a little strange but it really works for me Bc I‚Äôm the type of idiot who has to withdraw at work...(8-10 hours of lawn maintenance a day). For some strange reason or really helps me to have some dope with me. Not that I‚Äôm planning to use just to have in case I need it. It gives me peace of mind and also helps me get through the day Bc I‚Äôm not constantly thinking about the next time I‚Äôm gonna score. I know it sounds weird and it‚Äôs a lot of will power but before you know it the minutes are hours. And then you‚Äôre at lunch time. That‚Äôs where I‚Äôm at now, which I think is pretty good Bc I started trying to come off dope on Wednesday and I‚Äôve managed to get to lunch Wednesday, lunch Thursday, and all at work today. Of course I went and scored right after work but I already bagged it all up for next week and only smoked a little to see how potent it is. Oh also for anyone wondering I snort it and occasionally smoke it to test potency when I get a new batch. I‚Äôm not sure if my method will work for shooters. Or anyone besides me really.  But... I already feel better and going through a day of manual labor in the sun while withdrawing and not using was an amazing feeling, knowing it was right there if I needed it. Every hour that went by made me feel like a stronger person. Even though I had it right there with me. I have no idea why but just the thought of having a bag with me just in case helped me tremendously. I didn‚Äôt get sick except towards 6 this evening I was yawning and eyes watering and some of the beginning signs of withdraw. But instead of using the bag I took with me to work I added it in with the new stuff for next week. And I already bagged it all up so I have to go through the next 2 days withdrawing. I hope it works. That I‚Äôll slowly be able to withdraw with way. Let me know if you have any pointers or constructive criticisms or words of encouragement. Be safe out there y‚Äôall!

I strictly regulate my use, and have been able to for almost 10 years. If I'm using heroin, I can keep it to once every three days. If I'm using something which hangs around a bit longer (e.g. methadone), I keep it once every week. I've been able to avoid a physical addiction since I first began using in my early teens. Withdrawal was hard, but it ended after a few weeks.

I have treatment-resistant depression. I have tried almost every single psychiatric drug out there, with little help. I also suffer from periods of extreme panic attacks which can last from a few minutes to weeks or even months on end (seriously, it's hell). This has seriously derailed my life, and has cost me a significant amount in terms of relationships and my education/professional life.

When I'm high, that all goes away. I'm highly productive, I'm happy, and I'm generally a much more stable person. I have friends who are stabilised on methadone, who after many years still find it extremely effective in reducing their anxiety and depression.

I am seriously considering upping my usage in order to develop a habit from which I can then transition to a legit methadone script. Prescriptions are cheap where I live, funding this is not a problem. I figure, if it enables me to live the life I want, I can always come off it later. Withdrawals are bad, but even methadone has nothing on month long panic attacks. I know because I've experienced both.

2) don't make obnoxious noises over the mic, or play music over the chat. the bitrate for the sound channel is like 4, everything sounds like crap unless it's played through the built-in youtube player.  

3) don't dox anyone or take pictures or record the chat, this is a place people come to feel comfortable doing various things and anything that violates privacy results in an instant ban.  

4) that's basically it, just don't be a douche.

Ones that are pressed may look almost identical to a legit pharma oxy or whatever the pill may be. It is in your best interest to not take advice from anyone online saying your pill is real or fake, and to make the investment and get yourself an accurate test kit.

I was pushed into this when my family found out however I decided I do want to earnestly stick with this (although I'm fine using other non-opiates). I'm prescribed 16 mgs but I've been secretly tapering myself down. 8 mgs is fine but dropping below begins to get uncomfortable at the moment.


> Now, a friend of mine has 40mgs oxy that he doesn't need and I've been missing the feeling from those days when I'd treat myself with the odd speedball here and there. Unfortunately that's all he has but I'd like to be able to get something out of it, since shooting coke on its own is nowhere near as blissful. So I'll be shooting both and filtering with a micron filter. But with my suboxone use, would I get anything at all from the 40mgs oxy? What if I take a day, maybe even 2 off? Also, I've only ever used heroin in the past, and I had a monstrous tolerance, so does that change anything or is my suboxone dose really all you need to know to gauge the strength of 40 mg oxy?

Really wish I had 80 at least but how can I best make sure these don't go to waste?

And by the way, no I don't think this would make me relapse. I've literally had 0 cravings for opiates since starting subs EXCEPT for when I'm doing coke and craving the smoothness and vastly enhanced bliss of the combo.",1529716109.0

I‚Äôve been IVing MDMA crystals lately & coming down with xans. 

The rush is not as good as good coke or Dilaudid, but it‚Äôs pretty dope.

You feel it immediately, but the peak of the rush takes around 30 seconds & last‚Äôs about 10 minuets.

Much like coke, your heart stars pumping pretty hard, and you ponder if you should call 911 before you die. But around the 45 second mark, most of the anxiety goes away and you start rolling balls. Then you feel social.

The peak is short, around 45 min, but the comedown is a lot smoother than if you were to take it orally. And the high feels ‚Äúcleaner‚Äù.

I‚Äôve just been chilling watching anime with my lil bro & playing Dragon Ball FighterZ/fortnite.

I know I‚Äôm killing my veins guys, but it‚Äôs okay. I‚Äôm getting some more micron filters soon.

It doesn't get me high. He had 11 7.5 mg hydrocodone pills so i got those instead. Broke them all in half so it'd hit me a little faster and I got a good high but not really high or close at all to an OD. I know without a tolerance 82.5 mgs of Vicodin would OD most people. For my first real opiate high I had to take like 50-60 mgs of hydrocodone to get a buzz.  Any thoughts or opinions? Any one have a similar problem?",1529679033.0

My spiral down hill leading to rehab...,"Yo what's good everyone ! Last year around the end of October I checked myself into rehab .... Yes willingly. I was just about fed up trying to maintain my job and at the same time trying to stay well and not go I to WD everyday, i was doing at least a ball a day of tar (IV) towards the end of my run probably the last 3 months . Had started off with the roxies (green 15's, blue 30's) 4 years ago snorted my first 30 and fell in love ... fast forward 2 years and once the oxy habit was at 300 mg a day I knew I had to go a cheaper route , my cousin told me about a dude who had fire tar and that would hook it up since he is a family friend. Took the offer and bought 2 g's of Black I knew nothing about , I knew you could smoke it or shoot it but I didn't know how. I asked my cousin to help me out and she said half nodding out "" just rip a fat chunk and throw it in a visine bottle"", "" add water half full, then drip drop it down your nose...slowly"" I was like wtf? So I tore off at least a .4 and stuffed it in the visine bottle shook it up till i had pitch black liquid , tilted the head back and HOLY FUCKING BALLSACK i just felt like I snorted a line off the devils dick! It burned so bad but after a few more drops in each nostril I was feeling warm, fuzzy , and euphoric. Nothing like the oxy but still good in its own way it got the job done and it lasted me a good while at first. Now two months go by and my nose is raw as fuck , and it's not hitting me the same anymore ( tried smoking it numerous times and almost threw up, hated the fucking burnt taste ) so I hit my cuz up and ask if she would be willing to shoot me up, she refused and said "" I promise you , you'll regret it"" and hung up. Called again this time offering her a half g and about a gram of hard i had got chunked plus cash for driving 100 miles to drop off dope. Needless to say she was at my place in 15min. The crack must have been superb because she said she heard the train lol (she shoots hard by the way how? Idk) anyway after she got right she loaded me up a .4 and had narcan on stand by she walked me through thoroughly step by step and told me she was only showing me once. She hit me right on the side of my wrist below the thumb and once she pulled back I could barely even see blood register it was so dark but when she pushed down .... it took my breath away , instant taste of vinegar followed by a pins and needles feeling that brought me to my knees ... I swear I creamed my pants a bit after lol that's how good it felt . Then shit just got out of hand from 2016 up until the end of October last year , over dosed 4 times , all times brought back by narcan. My veins in both my arms are completely shot and I have a gnarly scar where I had a bad abcess they had to slice open . My neck veins feel weird and kinda hard in some spots from shooting in my neck when I couldn't hit arms or legs...

It took me a long time to accept that I was dependant (strangely it seems my mind didn‚Äôt want to let me believe it). Once I came to know for sure I was and there was nothing I could immediately do about it I searched for a cheaper way to stay well out of economic necessity.  I really couldn‚Äôt keep buying pills and heroin (I was using both) for much longer without suffering financially.

Looking back I really wish I hadn‚Äôt been so smart and stupid at the same time because of course all I really did was kick the can down the road and make an even bigger problem -- It still has to be dealt with. I know that one gram of fentanyl lasts me about 2 months and I‚Äôm into my 6th gram now so has it been almost a whole year I‚Äôve been stupidly kicking the can down the road? I seriously find that really hard to believe yet the math can‚Äôt be lying. I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that however long it‚Äôs been it way too long and definitely time to do something about it. 

I never dose enough fentanyl to cause euphoria, just enough to keep me well. If one does dose enough to cause euphoria it is really very disappointing (compared to just about everything else) and you are also very close to an overdose (just a very few mcgs away) so I don‚Äôt ever go there anymore and haven‚Äôt in many months. My understanding (and experience) is that this isn‚Äôt the case with fentalogues (substances similar to fentanyl, many created to avoid the schedule of controlled substances which doesn‚Äôt help any more now there is the Fentanyl Analogues Act). I also do the same thing with other substances, like heroin and pharmaceuticals, not dosing enough to cause any euphoria but just a maintenance dose but I must admit that with heroin (and certain pharmaceuticals) it is just too tempting not to push just a little more (on some rare occasions) if one is having a particularly bad day and take a very short opioid induced vacation basking in the warm and wonderful euphoria that heroin and a few other select substances can obviously provide if you dose enough :)

My wife has no clue and with each passing day it gets less likely I‚Äôll come through this without her finding out about it but I still hold out some small hope this will be the case and I‚Äôm really afraid it will destroy our otherwise really good marriage. I would like to try to go to NA meetings but can‚Äôt as my wife is smart and would likely line up the times I wasn‚Äôt home with the meeting dates and times :)  Also I never lie to her (obviously I don‚Äôt tell her everything) so if she ever were to ask me directly I‚Äôm pretty sure I would have to tell the truth.

I‚Äôve done (literally) many days of research into buprenorphine maintenance therapy and I think it could be a really good fit for me. I‚Äôve communicated with lots of people that use buprenorphine and found out a lot of information, some of it that many Doctors obviously aren‚Äôt aware of. Like for instance, I ""know"" after much research that buprenorphine won't do it for me and my stupid fentanyl addiction (many have warned me not to even try), so much so that I'm not even going to try ‚Äúdirectly‚Äù. When the day comes (and it must come soon and really can't come soon enough) I will have to switch to something else a week (or preferably two) before trying to switch to buprenorphine. I've communicated with a good number of people who tried to switch from fentanyl to buprenorphine, even at the maximum dose many were **‚Äùvery sick and confused‚Äù** as to why it wasn't working when the their Doctor told them it would but apparently it simply won't because it can't. There is something about the pharmacology of fentanyl (somehow related to the lipid solubility) that causes it to stick around for several days (even though the effect has long since worn off and the person is well into expected natural withdrawal symptoms (scoring 12 or greater on the COWS scale) and then cause **brutally more severe precipitated withdrawal** when buprenorphine is introduced. Now that the time is near and I am getting ready to turn the page on this I realize that there are still a few more very important questions I forgot to ask.

I haven't used any fentanyl in a week now as I have been doing a trial run replacing it with heroin (to ensure that my intended approach is still practical) and that has worked out. 

Even though I was using fentanyl, I have found that I can manage well on about 3.5g of ECP heroin per week. So I figure if I get about 7g of ECP heroin and use that for a full two weeks (3.5g/week max) before switching to buprenorphine I should be OK as after two weeks since I used fentanyl I won‚Äôt be switching from fentanyl to buprenorphine, rather I‚Äôll be switching from heroin (or whatever else I can get) to buprenorphine.  At least that‚Äôs my current ‚Äúplan‚Äù.

There really are no other heroin users in my area and I know this to be true because the lab that the authorities use to analyze seized drug samples has never been asked to analyse heroin samples from my area (I read their annual reports), there is just no heroin around me (except what I have from time to time and I buy it 1500 miles away in another city I travel to often) and of course there are obviously somewhere around me must be a few more secret addicts who wish to remain secret and are obviously doing a good job of it :)

So is 3.5g of ECP per week a lot?  Have you used this much and been able to switch to buprenorphine with manageable withdrawal symptoms (e.g. symptoms that could still be hidden and unnoticeable to those around you)? 

One other question also occurs to me: If I were to be unfortunate enough to end up in a severe precipitated withdrawal scenario (to spite my best efforts), can I dose one opioid or another to reverse it or would that only make it worse?

Thanks so very much!

Did I finally get a JJ moment?,"I posted a couple months or so ago asking y‚Äôalls thoughts on trying my guy‚Äôs IR morphine or sticking with his OCs because of the price differences ($3 for morphine 20, $8 for OC20).

Took the plunge and ordered both. I liked the morphine in a different way - it‚Äôs great for the pain at night, when the sedative effects are a non issue.

Last week he shipped my next order, a mix of OC20 and OC80 (price per mg much better for 80) plus 60 morphine. It was coming from overseas but was scheduled for delivery later that week. I was running low on meds, so when delivery didn‚Äôt happen as scheduled, and then tracking stopped  by end of week, I panicked. I ran out over the weekend so the last three days I‚Äôve been battling withdrawals, trying to keep them at bay with some loperamide. 

In touch throughout, he sent me a reship using a less expensive service yesterday, Wednesday morning, and also added additional product to compensate for the reduced shipping service. I didn‚Äôt even expect that, but wow, I was already impressed. 

Then this morning I received an email that read: ‚ÄúGood morning HMT, it appears miracles do happen. Your original order is landing soon.‚Äù

I check tracking and it was out for delivery, and the doorbell rang about 30 minutes later. I couldn‚Äôt believe it. I‚Äôve never had a JJ moment ever before, and thought they were elusive as hell. I was a little worried that it was all a set up, surely this was a controlled delivery. Alas, it was not.

So not only did I not have to wait any longer for my meds, but I‚Äôm also receiving a double order. I offered to pay him for the second order and he declined. 

Im so happy to share my JJ moment! I see them posted all the time and get so jealous of y‚Äôall when I run into hurdles and could use JJ. I can‚Äôt believe I actually have a JJ moment to share!

I've been in and out of the court system multiple times because of two DUI's and minor pot charges. Back when I was 18 or so I had got into xanax and kpins pretty bad, sniffed dope a couple times, and did all your common painkillers and shit like that. I OD's on heroin in my parents basement around this time, because I had ate a few kpins and snorted about a half gram. My friend was smart enough to get my father, and my father tried CPR on me and then called the rescue squad. This event was one of those things that just sits in the back of your mind always. My dad brings it up and reminds me of it when he's explaining how much he loves me and doesn't want to lose me, if anything ever happened to me.

I OD'd again at a friends house, and was lucky to have a friend go get narcan and hit me with that. I got pretty heavy into my dope use around 19-21 or so. I was somehow able to get off of it though. I didn't use suboxone or anything like that to help me. I was just able to stop. I really don't even know how I did it being completely honest. But here I am, a few years later. Been sniffing everyday for atleast 4-5 months... honestly, it's been alot more than that, I just hate to think about it. Probably been using daily 7-8 months now.

The worst part is, atleast to me that is, is that i've also started to bang it. It hasn't got to the point where I absolutely have to shoot it, and can't snort it, but I just never thought i'd be shooting it. I never had anything against needles or anything, I had just always snorted it and that was fine with me.

I'm tired of being like this and honestly really want to stop. I have lost probably 30 pounds, I don't hangout with alot of the people I use to because I'm embarrassed, I'm just not the same. I'm still a hardworker, and a good guy, it's not like I have turned into a scumbag or a degenerate, I'm just tired of having to get high to feel ""normal""

I've been through plenty of counseling programs and all of that type of stuff- from all the court mandated things. They were all drug treatment programs. So please don't tell me passages or something like that. I really do want to get clean, because I know for a fact that this is the worst I have ever been about using.

I have had the ability to have it everyday, but it's to the point, where I go throughout the day, making sure that I will have some when I wake up in the morning, and all that shit. I absolutely hate it. I have been thinking about the vivitrol shot, but to get the shot you have to be clean. I don't think I can go the amount of time to get clean to get the shot. The place offers a 5 day detox, but it's 7 grand. I'm going to see a subuxone doctor next thursday, and i'm sure I will get the prescription, but that's honestly not even what I wanted to do.

I honestly just want to be strong enough to go the 3-5 days of god awful withdrawls and uncomfortableness, to beat it myself- but it's so much easier said than done. This is my first post so I'm sorry for being a noob, but i've been a long time lurker, and needed somewhere to go for help...

I went to rehab almost 3 years ago and have been clean for the most part since then.  When I was using I did about 3 30mg pandas a day.  Had a huge tolerance.  I did sub strips a few times and would cut one into 8ths.  And they would. Always keep me from withdrawal.  

Recently a friend of mine went to rehab and got a bunch of strips.  He gave me one, and I proceeded to cut it into 8ths and took one sliver of it.  Needless to say I absolutely wasted from it for over a day.  I‚Äôve managed to do it only every 4 days.  But it completely rocks me when I still have over half of the original strip from last week.  

I guess my question is, is this normal?  I know I have no tolerance anymore but aren‚Äôt these supposed be abuse proofed with naloxone?  I took 1/8th at 1pm today even now I can barely even type this post out.  It‚Äôs taken me well over 20 mins and I keep nodding out.  ",1529636371.0

Coming off a a large IV fentdope habit I can tell you that 24mg barely held me correctly for 24 hours, sometimes I needed to take the maximum dose recommended by the manufacturer; 32mg 

While 4mg of bupenorphine may squash your withdrawal from 150mg of oxycodone, it will do nothing for habits of harder opiates such as diacetylmorphine, oxymorphone, and hydromorphone.

I know exercise and a good diet help but I'm wondering about a medication. 

Like okay, I've never used steroids (testosterone) but I've done a lot of research on it and when you use steroids for a while your body stops making it naturally, so when you stop it takes a good while for your body to start again. To combat this, a lot of people take PCT (post cycle therapy) there are a few different brands, but their purpose is to make the body start making testosterone naturally again a lot faster than it would without taking any medication. 

Is there not anything like that but for dopamine? I'm not too educated on the science of drug addiction so this is probably a stupid question, but I figured I'd ask anyways. Is what I'm asking impossible to make? Are people working on making something that does this? Lol. Imagine if there was a medication that made your brain make the chemicals naturally again at normal levels within like a month or two rather than like 3-6 months (I know it varies) then you would just get through the shitty acutes and know that the PAWS wouldn't last nearly as long.

---

The first time I met her (Lady Heroin), it was at an unfamiliar motel off of Grand Street. The street walker type always frequented this corner but tonight it was oddly quiet and still. That set the scene for the first time I‚Äôd lift off. A buddy had talked me into it. Now to give you a little background I was no spring chicken to the market of chemical sedatives. I had no tried one I didn‚Äôt love. Hell, I have fond memories nodding off to Disney movies as a child when my mother had dosed me with diphenhydramine (an allergy medication). From this point on I knew it was meant to be, you and me.

  As the years went on I was mostly a reefer man. Loved the stuff. Deliciously sedating, yet creativivty-enhancing. I wrote some of my best (and first) poems thanks to the goodie-laced herb. Now as you know here in the land of the free, our laws are a little special, in the very worst way. First of all, if you smoke weed you are mostly likely in contact with some less than ironclad folks. Who to trust? Who is selling what else? Who fucking knows? Now‚Ä¶ remember this is back in the good ole days before legalization, kids. Coming from the adult-child‚Ä¶

   So next comes college, where I meet my weed dealer at orientation immediately. Before school even began I was ‚Äúin‚Äù. I just knew this contact would lead to many great things. Boy was I right‚Ä¶ (and wrong). We used to smoke blunts all day while skipping class and playing video games. Ahh what a use of my parents money. ‚ÄúIf they could see me right now‚Äù, I thought‚Ä¶ Little did I know what I was doing then was nothing in comparison. One day I visited my dealer friend. He was a hippie of all hippies. We got tripped out on DMT and played hackey sack. We snorted pills and watched ‚ÄòFear and Loathing‚Äô‚Ä¶ Wait did I hear that right? 

   Yeah‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs right. It was that quick of a transition. I had only known the sweet, seductive warm mistress as ‚Äúroxy‚Äù or ‚Äúrockets‚Äù at that point. They called them rockets because the lines left after smoking them, which I never tried. Seemed a waste to me of that beautiful blue powder. I would go on trying this Roxy of mine time and time again. Never abused her. I remember one day I was with her at a musical festival. Only I didn‚Äôt get into the festival with no money, and the ‚Äúfriends‚Äù I was with were all VIP but couldn‚Äôt do anything for me. I end up wondering around the city for hours, high off my balls, and wearing a cowboy hat for some reason (long fucking story‚Ä¶ I still have that to this day). I only found my way home that night with a drunk man, his friend and his wife. I remember smoking literally blunt after blunt in that car on the way home to the mountains of Kentucky. It is a memory which sparkles in my mind and appears in my dreams sometimes. Was it at all real? 

   More months go by, and I‚Äôm seeing Roxy here and there. Me and here like to go out together and socialize. I had never met someone who gave me such great confidence! It felt pure and honest and surreal! I loved my trips with her, yet didn‚Äôt abuse her. I said I never would. What would be the point of dulling my intense feelings for her? Then life came. My 11 year-old best friend, my golden retriever died one day, and then my world flipped upside down.

His name was Copper, the shiny bronze medallion which he wore his fur like. He would follow me out on skate runs, and my friends and I would have to ditch him by hopping a fence somewhere. It sounds cruel in retrospect but we were just looking out for him. He had been hit before by a car on the main roads. Knocked clear from one side to the next, unhurt. Copper scurried straight home on the railroad tracks, the shortest way. I had always been a man of the tracks, once walking 14 miles on them to order pizza. Anywho, Copper was laid to rest by my own hands as well as my father‚Äôs. I remember he actually scooped him in the bucket on our new super-powered lawnmower/tractor type vehicle. He was so bloated and heavy now, maybe 15 hours after death. 

As Copper was lowered down into the sacred ground on which he was buried (the forest edge of my backyard where we played together so often as younger ones‚Ä¶), I felt my heart sink into my chest. This is anxiety I thought‚Ä¶ No?! Fear..? That‚Äôs it? I was wrong. This was something much much worse: loss (something I would learn much about in the new game I was about to play). 

That game my friends was the dope one. It was a dope one alright! It was also a shitty fucking terrible game at times. I loved it. As I sat alone in my room in my rolling computer chair on the hardwood flooring, I span about in it, cursing at the air. Saying if I just had another pill right here I‚Äôd probably shoot the fucker into my veins using anything at my disposal (I didn‚Äôt IV then). Turns out I was quite broke at this time. I look around as I often do, racking up the cash value on my living space. My xbox controller I thought‚Ä¶ Yes, this will do nicely. The pawn shop is closed but my dealer has an xbox, so who knows? He might trade. I text Benny up. 

[He‚Äôs a dense boy I‚Äôve known since school kids. He apparently has a lot of money somehow. I think he works somewhere I‚Äôve long since forgotten. Something with trucks? I dunno. At first I thought he was stealing the pills from his mom, but I later realized my other dealer right up the mountain from Benny was actual the supplier for him as well. Now Benny was dense and also liked me. I was a manipulative, attractive young pharmaceutical addict. I could get him to come down on prices all the time. (No, you dirty-minded creatures. No gay stuff happened there though I got that vibe) So I would go to Benny instead of Japan up the road (nickname of the good source dealer way up on the mountain) because Benny would take a loss sometimes just to make a sale to me. Weird huh? I still haven‚Äôt figured that one out. Oh did I mention Benny was dumb enough to think the cops where already onto him as a small time new dealer, so he buried his cash and pills in his yard with me watching where, mind you!

Now if Benny is Benny, then Japan is the Jets! He had some fire cocaine (well if I would even know the difference). It was my first time trying it not long before this whole dog incident. Another friend of mine, Garth, a seasoned pothead who introduced me to Japan and cocaine. Hell yeah! We often rode around in my light blue Toyota‚Äôs version of a Caddilac, slanging outdoor cheap weed in order to make enough profit for a sack of white girl and an oxy to come down with. Garth didn‚Äôt do pills but I showed him the power of an oxy on demolishing a stimulant comedown. Good influence I am. Well shit! He showed me coke!]

Okay, I ran off topic there. My apologies if I‚Äôm a shit narrator. There are just so many layers to this dope game and the stories she weaves. Where was I? Oh yes‚Ä¶

Benny replies to my text: ‚ÄúNo bro I don‚Äôt take trades..‚Äù. Fuck. This means I am going to have to figure something else out. I think of all the other dealers‚Ä¶ Japan won‚Äôt trade. He‚Äôs all business. Garth is just a user like me, always broke wanting to ride off the coattails of my money and vehicle. I can‚Äôt text either of them. Then it hits me‚Ä¶ Something I wish never had even fucking dawned on me because it opened up a whole new rabbit hole which I couldn't climb my way out of. I became Alice on that day. 

I had been helping my family clean out a relative‚Äôs old house, who had died of cancer. I knew with cancer there is always pain meds involved, so the obsession struck me to search. It was my duty then and there, in my broken ass, twisted mindstate after the loss of my precious friend, to find those fucking pills. I ventured upstairs, and lo and below there is a Walmart bag out of place hanging out from his side of the bed. I drag it out, empty it and like the scene from pulp fiction, an orange glow brightens my face as my gaze fixes upon the words written on all these boxes in front of me‚Ä¶ 

This next part of the story is completely a hazy, distant memory transposed in the backdrop of my mind. To go back there I have to reach a deep meditative state, akin to the buddhist monk who lit himself on fire in protest of government. That is the state I would be in for the following months. What I had, my friends was a goldmine. I just didn‚Äôt know it yet. Fentanyl? I‚Äôve heard of that I think. I was just a virgin to the opiod‚Äôs soft fucking at this point. Now never in my life would I have justified what I was about to do. Stealing from a dead family member?  Well.. it wasn‚Äôt pretty and it didn‚Äôt end that way either. At the time I really didn‚Äôt care. My love, my pretty golden dog had died. I was getting fucking high! I justified it with ‚Äúhe won‚Äôt need these anymore‚Äù. However, there‚Äôs still a ton of fucking drug left on them. 

I open up one of the boxes and pull out a translucent little patch labeled ‚ÄúFentanyl 100mcg transdermal‚Äù or something of that sort. Hm‚Ä¶ better resort to the all knowing god that is google. I quickly slide back downstairs into my room, jump on my PC and hit up Bluelight, the classic drug reference forum. They say fent is dangerous stuff and that new users should not mess with it for recreation. I don‚Äôt listen. I remember that first night I had some friends over 20 minutes after I had taken a sliver of a fent patch on my gum. We watched cartoons as I melted into my bed. This is the life I thought, and I have an infinite supply. No one will notice these years-old meds are gone. Those are an example of typical addict‚Äôs habitual nature. Hoard up the wrappers and such in case there is a small amount of medicine left in them. Well my friends, there was plenty left in these!

It has a horrible ba orally of only 10% snorting gets it up to 45% but there is a fine line and if you snort too hard it will hust bypass your nose go injnto your stomach and then you lose so much of it, some will stick but 5he rest will just go down your throat into your stomach. The best way to do it, i get the g series which actually breaks down very well. I take the coasting off put it in the corner of a bag and crush it and then i use a razor blade and get it as fine as possible. Its worth taking your time. Then i make 3 lines and sniff very lightly to try and keep it all in your nose on the mucous membranes. Don't swallow at all and you want to avoid the drip at all costs for at least 20 minutes. Try to get your nose as clean and clear as possible first and use qtips and try to get your nose as dry as possible before snorting. Also its a little counter intuitive but eating a high fat meal right before can increase the plasma level by up to 40% even the drug company says this and warns aggainst eating an hoyr before or 2 hours after taking oxymorphone. I know this goes for taking it orally but not sure if it also goes for insufflation as Im not sure of the exact action that causes this but it cant hurt. Enjoy my friends. I walk my panda at least 3 times a day and im always looking for a new path so any insights or advice would ve great as my tolerance is fetting rediculous and i cant just take a whole lot.

Ok story time my friends. Now that im off of dope every little thing is triggering memories and one of your posts about an early phone call from the d boy did just that. About a year ago my phone rings at 3 am and its my guy. I'm all what the fuck? Answer the phone and he's in a panic speaking so fast i can almost smell the meth smoke through the phone. 
   
(Him) Hey SnowboardMore88 could you drive your truck over to my place and help me out? 
(Me) Umm maybe man what's up? 
(Him) Just come over please. I'll throw you a couple grams"" 
(Me) Yup on my way man. Now I've known this guy for about a year at this point and he only lives 15 mins away. 10 mins at this time of night because all the lights are green. On my way over i start considering just the sure absurdity of this situation. I have no idea what he wants or what i'm headed into all because the d boy dangled a couple free grams in front of me. For all i know he could be in a sleep deprived hallucination but I'm on my none the less. Sigh yup this is my life now apparently. 
 
So i pull up to his house and i can immediately see his truck is just fucked up. Which is a shame cuz he used to drive a beautiful 1960 something Chevy. His day job is working as a mechanic and he was good at it. This truck is his baby or it used to be. When i get out of my truck i realize he has parts and snap on tools spread out everywhere in his driveway and he is moving a million miles a minute in that special way only a tweaker can.

 
(Me) What's going on man? 
(Him) So I was driving home a little drunk and i had some shit on me. Turned a corner and some drunk old lady fucking smashed into my car.
(M) Holy shit dude. Are you ok? Was she ok?
(H) Yeah no one was hurt. First thing i did was make sure she wasn't hurt. Then i used her phone to call the cops. Then i fucking bounced and now here i am. 
(M) So what am i doing here? 
(H) Well here's my plan. I know you used to work on cars. So i figure we can get my bumper, fender, and radiator, belt and pulleys all replaced tonight. Because I aleady had extras lying around. Then. We can load the old ones in your truck. And i need you to go scrap em first thing in the morning while i spray paint my truck primer. And i should be good. 
(M) You think we can get this all done tonight? 
(H) Absolutely. Also you wanna hit this? and holds up his meth pipe Its take me a second to sort of process it all. I know this cant be legal but all my junky brain is thinking at this point is ""I should ask for more"" So i blurt out. 
(M) I'm gonna need more than two grams man 
(H) Ok how about 5 grams and you can keep the money from scrapping my old truck parts 
(M) Done. Hand me that pipe bud let's do
This. 

And god damn if we didn't get that whole job done before the sun started coming up around 6 30. Driving home in my truck with my bed full of parts in the morning i was just overcome with a fit of laughter at how ridiculous the whole night had been. And as far as i know no one ever showed up looking for him or his truck. So we really did all that work for nothing. But that was fine with me and my 5 grams i made out like a bandit.",1529597036.0
8st2js,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8st2js/gratitude/,9,https://redd.it/8st2js,atalossforwords00,Gratitude,"Its been a long time since I shot heroin, nearly 2 years now. I have been on suboxone for 5. The last few years I have been on methamphetamine which is a whole other type of misery but is mostly a lot easier to manage and deal with overdoses, withdrawal, etc. The rush is just as good tho as long as you can hit properly.

The point of my post is to let you know this community did a lot for me back in those days, 2013-2016. I met people online that helped me go from sick to well with not only a new middle man but often times a friend who not only sympathized with me but empatized. I have met maybe 6 or 7 people from online communities and they were always really solid people. Never once was I robbed. Never once were bags opened in major cities and skimmed off the top. No one gave me a short bag of tar out west. All the while I am suffering the disease of addiction, I had all of you in r/opiates. There was a guy in Tucson that i never met up with, who checked on me for an entire year to make sure I was okay. His name was Joe, last i heard from him was maybe 6 months ago. Never even met the guy in person. I was a Suicidal wreck for basically all my life, but there has never been a shortage of people who inspire enough hope in me for me to be able to see tomorrow. And some of those people are here in r/opiates

Your stories of copping, the dope porn, the harm reduction, the people around here who were well known back then, all gave me hope when I thought i had none. You guys were junkies but Jesus the compassion was enormous. And it was too often that a memeber stopped posting, sometimes someone on r/opiates knew the member who'd stopped posting in person, and was able to confirm their tradgic end. Its too often that some of us fell out, nodded out and never woke again. 


Whatever happens, this community has been positive. We enable each other's addiction because its fun for an addict to finally be treated like a human when we are seen as the scum of the earth. That's true. But the harm reduction alone and the overdose saves from Tracey's narcan alone is amazing. 

Thank you guys. I appreciate all this subreddit has done for me. Today I'm sitting in a VA clinic in Florida in a long sleeve shirt because my addiction the last too months too me to a dark place where i couldn't hit veins and essentially have been skin popping meth. My body is altered forever and will be scarred. To think 2 months ago i could wear short sleeves blows my mind. What has happened now is a nightmare. Maybe ill post some photos. Idk. Some dude from my algebra class just sat down next too me at the VA. I thought he was a straight edge guy but he has major depression, just tried to kill himself but is always smiling. So I better see what wisdom this son of a bitch has because i bet he is a lot like us. And we are often a crafty bunch. 

In the meantime, I hope this subreddit flourishes and is still as strong in someone's life as it was to me in my opioid days.


Edit: apparently i am really infected with something. Shooting dope and being unclean about it is no joke. I had to sign a release to cover the clinics ass when i left. Pulse was 130 and they wanted me to go by ambulance to a nearby emergency department for IV antibiotics and then up to the VA hospital 2 hours away. Its not good. I instead am ubering home to better hide my stash. No drug use today. Gonna just rest up and hit an ER in the Morning. Its not good at all. I feel so sick from this addiction. And I'm not ready to get clean. I know when I am gonna relapse before it happens. My heart is not in recovery. It just isnt. If I try it'll be months of misery with a huge disappointment for my family a few months later. Fuck it tho.",1529596977.0

I was thinking of going on suboxone treatment/maintnence, but I don't know what the requirements are. There's only 1 doctor even remotely close to me that accepts my insurance. I don't want to show up to the doctors office, him think I'm not qualified or not trust me with it, and be denied cutting off any chance in the future.

So what are the requirements for suboxone therapy? I've been told somethings not from doctors but others.

I hear one is that that you must be actively withdrawing (mildly)

I was told that you also had to have been an IV user for a certain amount of years

I was also told that you must test positive for opiates at a high threshold.

Right now I've been clean for 2 weeks now, and am not experiencing physical withdrawals, and I shouldn't have anything in my system, but honestly I know there's a big chance I will relapse after enough time goes by.

Ive gone through clean periods for a certain amount of time even months, but I always relapse, so I think suboxone maintenance is a good idea. So what should I tell the doctor? Should I forget about it know and make an appointment if I relapse, while its still in my system,? But honestly that rule (if it is one) sounds stupid, because if I relapse I doubt I'll even be willing to go on suboxone unless I can't get dope. Could someone tell me what the requirements are.",1529590709.0

Please Advise Regarding Drug Test on Suboxone.,"So I got referred to an addiction specialist a few weeks ago after seeking help for my heroin addiction. I'm in Australia, he started me on suboxone and down here we go to a pharmacy of our selection to be dispensed daily. In his first appointment he did very briefly mention to avoid benzos while on suboxone.

Now I understand that there is *technically* a risk of combining benzos with suboxone; but this risk is frankly negligible as suboxone has a high degree of safety. I also have an anxiety disorder (acute, diagnosed and documented) of which I still have some Xanax that I was given in my acute anxiety episode early 2017. I do occasionally take some Xanax; entirely reasonably, in times of high anxiety. I've had a lot of stress lately and anxiety has been high, been on the same dose of sub for weeks and any risk in using xanax therapeutically as-needed is frankly negligible n this context.

Two days before my appointment with addiction specialist today I used some xan (around 3mg~) over the course of two difficult days (this rough period culminated with finals on those days).

I saw my addiction doctor; talked about how I was going, mentioned anxiety (but not that I had PRN'd xanax; just didn't occur to me). We decided to up my suboxone to 8mg and also send me on my way with a urine analysis that I conducted immediately. It was a U-D-S.

I realized just afterwards how I may have fucked up.

**So my screen is definitely going to pop for xanax.**

**Now I smoked a really moderate amount of marijuana a few days before that as well; so I'm probably going to pop for bud too, though I'm not really worried about that**.

But essentially I've realised that because of the *technical* risk of dangerous (even though realistically improbable) interactions between suboxone and xanax; **what if he cuts my suboxone. Fuck FUCK FUCKKK. I'm really afraid. He's a nice doc; he knows my psychiatrist who has followed me for years, I'm going to call him tomorrow and explain this (as well as my anxieties) to him.**

I've read anecdotal reports of people being fine after popping for benzos and just having a chat with the doc (and maybe more frequent urine examinations). I've also read horror stories of people being cut off straight up.

I'm really scared. I can't just cold turkey off this, what if he tapers me? I'm gonna end up fucking relapse, fuckfuckfuck. I'm telling myself its unlikely I'm going to get shafted but I'm just really worried. The suboxone has allowed me to start properly getting my life back and now I might have fucked it. Fuck me why am I such a god damn piece of shit who cant do anything right.

If any of you have any advise/experiences please let me know, anything will help at this point. I'm really worked up even though it might be totally fine, but eurghhh. I mean, parents are even aware of my PRN benzo use; which is very uncommon, I wasn't at any point even told I would be tested and it was never stated that a possibility of failing urines could affect my suboxone therapy. Not once. This test kinda came out of nowhere. I'm 100% willing to be tested twice a freakin day indefinitely, if I show my motivation for this possibility could it help my cause? The possibility of being cut off is frightening me greatly and I hate myself for having potentially caused this.

8ss955,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8ss955/losing_friends_while_clean/,20,https://redd.it/8ss955,Uconn99041114,Losing friends while clean,"Hi All,

Curious if anyone has an experience similar to mine.

I‚Äôve been on bupe maintenance since about November now, and with a few notable exceptions I have been clean.  

Nevertheless, my habit never got too out of control for too long, not to downplay it.  I found myself using dope daily for a short period of time and with my history of going back to it now and again over the years I saw myself looking down a dark road - and decided to seek treatment.  When this occurred my incredibly innocent girlfriend was out of the country and I confided with a few close friends with what had happened.

One of whom was particularly receptive and told me to reach out if I needed anyone to talk to.  One of my best friends.

Anyways months pass.  And due to life this friend and I didn‚Äôt get to see each other as often as we normally did.  Until a couple months back, when he invited me to dinner.  We went out for steaks, something I could not afford at the time (I have a good job that pays well, but recently bought a condo and gut renovated it).  I had a couple glasses of wine and an ENORMOUS tomahawk steak, as we chatted and caught up.  Afterwards we met his girlfriend to walk around the town after a cup of coffee.

Now before I tell the next part of the story there are two distinct and important facts I need to divulge.  The first is that I have always had severe anxiety, for which I am prescribed Xanax.  The second is I left my old rental when I bought my new apartment and the gents I shared that apartment with were my friends since freshman year of college (2006).  They screwed me out of about 2 grand (between utilities and deciding not to pay me my security deposit back.  After a while of back and forth upon my moving, I decided I had two choices - small claims court or to cut them out of my lives and take the 2k life lesson.  Either way I had to be all in on the decision, and be comfortable with it forever there after.  I chose the latter.

Now we rounded a corner and though I did not see those two old roommates happen to be outside a local bar smoking cigs.  My friend and his girlfriend calmly whisked me away around the corner, afraid of how I may react.  After they did I calmly told them about the decision I made and how I had come to peace with it.  The reality of the situation though was much different, my anxiety spiked.  I began to have mini panic attacks that plateaued into a stream of non-stop anxiety.  I‚Äôm sure many others have anxiety related disorders in this board, and can relate.. but unless I am exhibiting visible symptoms I tend to keep it to myself until I can treat it properly. 

When we got back to my friends apartment I dipped to the bathroom to snort a Xanax (2mg‚Äôs in total on two separate occasions, to deal with this.  (The nasal fixation has been something that‚Äôs always stuck around).

And I don‚Äôt know if it was the $120 tomahawk steak, the wine, the pending feeling of dread or the Xanax... but I eventually closed my eyes on my friends couch for a few minutes.

I left, and time passed.  Like any best friend I made sure to keep contact at least twice a week.  Until all of a sudden the responses stopped coming.  That is until last night:

‚ÄúListen man, I've been keeping my space for personal reasons. Don't appreciate you messaging (redacted) and having him check in on me. You fell asleep in my house last time you were here and weren't yourself, I don't think you really realize that. You got some stuff to sort out and I got a lot of shit on my plate. Nothing personal but just chill out with the messages and having other people check in on me, that shits not cool. I just need some space. ‚Äú

To be fair I never asked anyone to check in on him.  Simply asked friends if he changed his number.  Now one of the people I was closest to in this world wanted nothing to do with me, because he was convinced I relapsed in his company.   I explained, to no avail... nor do I expect a response from my rebuttal and explanation.  But am absolutely crushed to lose someone, especially someone I used to be inseparable from.  

I thought you hurt people and lost friends and family when you used, not when you get clean.  Don‚Äôt mean to rant but I‚Äôve never had my use or lack thereof have such a profound effect on my life to date.  I‚Äôm absolutely crushed.  And there is nothing I can do or say to remedy the situation. 

Thanks for listening. ",1529590913.0

SHIK Bag is Large Organizer, Waterproof, Cosmetic And Makeup Compartments, Black, Free Bonus Name Tag. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078QYGFY8/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_HC3kBbVXYY8DB) Choice 4 could be one of those Vaults boxes but I can‚Äôt find a good on to put in my backpack since the edges jut into my feeding pump edges. 


And here‚Äôs what needs to fit in it: obv my smack, crystal, ativan, kpins, and coke. A good handful of rigs for the h and meth (I reuse them so not too many), a travel size soap bottle to carry water, a little stack of alcohol wipes, my eyedrops, two tourniquets, a thick folded square of foil, a dollar and two halves of a BIC pen, a 4.5‚Äùx2.5‚Äù mirror, a little plastic box of razors, a couple bandaids, a vetwrap roll, and my liquid bleed-stop spray because I have VWD, a ziplock bag of cotton balls or q tips, two spoons, maybe my cigs, a couple lighters, m pipes (straight & bowl), my narcan, a sleeve of ondansetron, a few of my nitro and lopressor, and mints or smth to keep my tongue attached my mouth. TL:DR it‚Äôs a lot. 


Does anyone have any idea what to replace my old friend with? I‚Äôm def not married to these ideas; really I just want something that fits everything and preferably has compartments somewhere just so everything‚Äôs not jumbled together. I would think about throwing the zofran, lopressor, and eletriptan in with my backpack supplies if need be, so those aren‚Äôt really a MUST. Bonus points if it locks and it‚Äôs under $35. He‚Äôs doing me a huge favor since I‚Äôm literally selling blood fetish porn, selling my own heart medication, and stealing car parts for money so I don‚Äôt wanna ask that much of him.

8sqqxe,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8sqqxe/opioid_crisis_what_a_crock_to_destroy_lives_and/,13,https://redd.it/8sqqxe,Vintendo56,"Opioid Crisis? What a crock, to destroy lives and families just for a lie...","Of course, I am one of the victims of this horrendous lie, in fact I was in the vanguard of those whom some politician who knows me as well as I know any rich people, which is to say not at all. and then to cut off both opiate pain meds (15 years) and clonazepam (41 years) cold turkey, even when the dosage and length of the clonazepam very possibly could have been lethal and had I not gone to a psych it would have. The *clinic* felt it perfectly appropriate in abruptly discontinuing the equivalent of 120mg of Valium from a patient with a seizure history. I thank God for that at least.

The opiates presented a challenge. I quit those after cutting to 160mg Oxy and it darned near took me out! That does not even take into account how the daily grinding pain from post-chemo systemic disorders, along with the original multiple trauma's that cause pain so severe there are times I can't even shower myself, and as the months roll on (clean 8 months now) I am beginning to have cascading systems failure.

The impact on my life has turned into something you wouldn't force on a sick pet. I've deteriorated from an award winning humor columnist, author, musician, artist, potter, public speaker and seminar speaker as well as a high mountain river Steelhead fisherman, to a phobic recluse who can't sit, stand or walk well enough to do anything like that due to traumatic brain injury, anxiety and serious permanent neck, back, and leg pain. Every person I knew and know has aid my personality has changed rom a motivated, crazy lunatic who loved people and places to an agoraphobic who cant call, and has dropped out of sight. From everyone. I have never felt right, and it is slowly worsening.

What really bothers me is the blatantly hollow lie of averting the opioid crisis. There never has been a crisis. 2016 Sessions and Co., released a staggering 61,000 opiate-related deaths. The statistics never revealed that if a person was hit by a bus, had drunk a gallon of tequila and taken a 5 mg Percocet, it would be ruled an opiate-related death. In fact of the 61,000 deaths, only 2,000 were the result of prescription opiates alone, with near a third being suicides. The other 59K were from heroin and street opiates. During the same year there were up to 90,000 deaths A DAY from 'hospital error,' yet NO mention of a crises there. The stated reason for this opiate pogrom ""rather Stalinesque"" one might say in how it was started.

The intent according to the Governor who allowed this travesty of humanity to be the pilot state, said it was because so many of the poor people were selling their prescriptions. I know, with some non-chronic pain patients, or those getting them for recreation that DOES happen. With PAIN people, especially low income, the last thing on one's mind is to sell any of a 30 day supply. When every alternative is even more expensive, lowering your pill count is ludicrous.

Once again, thank God, I was lucky. During chemo due to medical ignorance and Big Pharma kickbacks I ended up in such pain, a relatively 'pill tight"" doctor had me on 270mg methadone, 16mg Dilaudid and 30 mg standard oxy for break through. But when the DEA and other agencies started raiding both compassionate and learned doctors who know ""pain kills"" as well as any lawyers who would defend them. All lost their licenses, and 2 in each state would go to prison. Immediately all but the most courageous or foolhardy would fall in line, make patients sign 'pain contracts"" that are the very definition of contracts of adhesion which are unconscionable. But no lawyer will take a case. And you will search far and wide for a doctor who will help you, because now you're a drug seeking junky.

This has had the unintended (really?) consequences of turning people's pain-wracked Grandmothers, Grandfathers, Dads, Moms, family and friends to turn to the streets, actually becoming junkies, just in an effort to alleviate pain I can guarantee you they did not ask to have...then through inexperience become robbery targets. violent rip off victims or dead in a number of ways. As the number of deaths nearly doubled every year in the first four years, NOBODY saw a correlation? 

I don't know if this goes to the right place or not, if not I'm sorry for the long read. This is the most I can write, hope it helps.",1529576639.0

My parents didn't know | My whole family knows 
I was in college | I took an LOA for rehab and didn't go back

I thought quitting some day was possible | I think my best chance is staying on maintenance forever

1) don't do any sort of -isms, it's just not cool and i run a leftist room. your opinions are welcome but no personal attacks or nasty stuff about groups of people. if you want to be rude, get personal, there's plenty of stuff to say about people without going for low-hanging fruit.  

2) don't make obnoxious noises over the mic, or play music over the chat. the bitrate for the sound channel is like 4, everything sounds like crap unless it's played through the  built-in youtube player.  

3) don't dox anyone or take pictures or record the chat, this is a place people come to feel comfortable doing various things and anything that violates privacy results in an instant ban.  

4) that's basically it, just don't be a douche.  

the room is at https://tinychat.com/room/ropiatesubchat  
anyone is welcome regardless of beef and personal history so long as you keep it off the table.

Once you finish opiate court they put you into drug court, which I'm sure a lot of you know about and that lasts a year.

J didn't have to go but he wanted to get groceries and whatever for the house so they were going to the store after copping. 

Right down the street from our house they got blurped. They don't even know where the cop came from either. They got pulled over for 'headlights' but no ticket or anything. Sam's car needs these specific headlights that are really expensive so she uses her brights. She's been doing this for like a year now and never been pulled over besides this one time. Sam gave J the cash she had on her for the sack so he can put that on his books. And that's that. 

He only had to do thirty days but still shitty. Sam and her boyfriend D are our bestfriends and we cop together everyday and kick it. They help us and we help them.

Facts:

* I went to a Jewish junky who middled for me and got a half. 

* The half tasted like cut that was in his dope once before, but this time it was overwhelming.

* The bag was fat, because it was like mostly or all seasoning.

* The middle's house smells a bit like this seasoning. Smell is linked to memory.

It is a very racist question, I know I'm walking a fine line.

The individual who sold the stuff to me is jewish, their house smells like this seasoning (memory is linked to smell) so that's why I am so specific to implicate the cooking of the culture with the smell of this dope.

I'm going to investigate now by checking my turmeric and comparing. I am disgusted by the possibility that I may snort this whole fucking thing.

It smells like the aroma left over from cooking in this guy's jewish house. That's why the best I can say is it smells like ""jew seasoning.

I'll try comparing it to turmeric right now as someone suggested.

I never do talk trash about him and I am well within my goddam right to be speaking ill of him right the fuck now.

Correction: I never did. Now, this is the second time. It's way more seasoning than dope. I gave him the benefit of doubt last time. This time there are no doubts.

It is definitely a Kosher seasoning. In my angst, I did speak precisely what was on my mind when writing this post.

""A bag of ‚Äúheroin‚Äù sold to a drug user was tested and the results were:
Fentanyl

Lidocaine 
Carfentanil

My drug of choice is meth which I would shoot up and eventually a friend told me to try heroin so I did and I started shooting up instantly. I never did very much and would nod off but would never ever get a rush that I was told so much about so one night (around 10 p.m.) after feeling good but no rush I decided to do another shot and see if I could feel any better which I know is stupid but I was pretty depressed at that point in my life so I didn't care. I remember waking up at around midnight drenched in sweat so I moved over to my couch where there's an ac window unit and then promptly passed out. I remember hearing the sound of somebody throwing up and realized it might be me so I thought I should probably go to the bathroom and the next thing I know it's 10 in the morning and my roommate is knocking on the bathroom door asking if he can get in to get ready for class. I think I told him I was sick or something and he just went somewhere else to get ready. I guess I fell asleep after that because then I suddenly woke up and it's 4 in the afternoon. I could taste in my mouth that I had thrown up at some point and I somehow had almost no vomit on my shirt and it's mostly in the toilet but I have no recollection of actually throwing up or anything other than hearing it in the middle of the night.  
So my question is, was this an od or did I do enough to just sleep through everything that was going on? I was always under the impression that an od means you'd stop breathing and would die without medical attention but when I talked to my friend she said I had od'ed and got mad at me for doing as much as I did.",1529535621.0

I wasn‚Äôt exactly clean before that, I was abusing codeine and tramadol for 6 years up until I went to the clinic a few months ago. They gave me subuxone as opposed to subutex which worked a treat last time. That stuff drives me nuts, my doc went on holiday for two months, I‚Äôve only been in this country for a year and they‚Äôre super strict with prescription meds so I went out and scored some gear because subuxone can go die a miserable death in hell. Doc is back Friday. 

Anyway, I was reading the top posts from the last month and read the post about the airline pilot dude who nearly got busted by security for wrapping his drugs in foil. Made me realise I‚Äôm not the only pilot out there who uses. I‚Äôm not an airline pilot, and I‚Äôm in a very different field, a much more dangerous one and am quite well known in that field but I don‚Äôt carry passengers. I never flew while high. Was taking two large doses of codeine twice a day. Never flew while I was riding out the high (I would drive to the airport though). It didn‚Äôt impair me, just gave me an almost hour long buzz. 

Do we have any more of you on here? A lot of my pilot buddies do use drugs quite lot, mostly coke, a lot of coke and I have one other pilot buddy who I know uses opiates recreationally and he‚Äôs the only one who knows I do. Starting to wonder if it is my friend in fact now... aviation is small. 

What are your guys views on that? Would you feel safe knowing that one of your airline pilots, flight instructors, airshow pilots were using opiates.

Fent gives you a decent rush, but there‚Äôs none of that typical opiate energy involved where you feel like you‚Äôre on speed (a phenomenon I‚Äôve noticed with heavy opiate users as what draws us to them, instead of working like a depressant the complete drop in inhibition, massive bump in motivation, and overall increase of energy makes it feel more like speed - whereas when I get really good ice (smoked) it‚Äôs a very euphoric, clear, but ‚Äúslow‚Äù high...where time slows down but I‚Äôm not about the clean the kitchen like I am on opiates). I bet everyone is different here but, anecdotally, I know I am not alone.

High quality dope gives a very specific type of rush...that histamine response which leads to pins and needles (and honestly is where I reach my ceiling as anymore and the pins and needles become uncomfortable - for me that‚Äôs around 4 bags of high quality ECP (stuff around New York - don‚Äôt think saying an area that is hundreds of square miles and contains well over 10 million people qualifies as sources...though let me know if if does and I‚Äôll remove immediately).

We all know that fent has little to no legs compared to dope, but the biggest thing I notice is that subsequent doses...for me about 4-6 hours later...another shot of dope equal to my first shot I actually get a nice rush.  Nothing like the rush from being sick to high, but it‚Äôs pronounced and there.  Whereas fent does not exhibit this...it‚Äôs almost like a waste when your redosd and I try wait until I‚Äôm not feeling perfect well I get any rush at all, but my addict brain generally doesn‚Äôt allow that.

Is volumetric dosed fent more dangerous than snorting powder heroin? I don't try to get very high, so I'm not inclined to intentionally push the limit on safe dosing... I'm just taking enough to feel decent when I dose. I'm considering switching from h to furanyl fentanyl since it's much cheaper. 

Are there risks that I'm missing in my thinking?  I thought the two big risks of fentanyl are when doing powder (risky eyeballing instead of volumetric dosing) and also when doing intentionally high doses because the euphoria is weak so people take too much to try to get euphoria?

So, 5 years ago I met this girl that I really got along with. We were super similar, two peas in a pod. Inseparable, spent all our time together and had nothing but fun and easy living. 

I come from a middle class family, w strong family ties. She has a meth fueled biker army as a family and I never held it against her and was always on good terms with them. 

Jump forward 2 years and she started wanting to do tar with me. I obliged. We got on the ride to disasterville, and before I knew it we were deep into fentalogs. It didn't affect me negatively, but she was declining health wise and mind wise all the time more and more. 

After 3 years and constantly being attentive to her over doses trying to monitor her breathing 24:7, have narcane handy and keep a good grip mentally on cpr, I finally had to lock up the dope in my gunsafe because she'd be stealing from my stash when I finally got sleep. 

This worked for a while but not long. Finally the sleep deprivation took its toll on me, and I slept until 12:30pm on one faithful Easter. 

I woke up to find her blue on the floor, completely cold w my gunsafe pried open and foil in her death grip and a tooter in her hair. 

My father and I tried our best to revive her to no avail. Had to call the ambulance. Again. This time was the third time in 2 months I had to call for her. And this time they all knew us by name and what the issue was. 

To make a long story short, she's alive and ""well"" but has suffered serious nervous system damage in her brain. It's almost like a stroke ( I think) it affects her motor skills and speech severely. 

So we no longer live together at this point because I'm kicking tetrahydro fu-f cold turkey and it was a bitch. So I couldn't physically care for an invalid whether I wanted to or not. And I did, very much. 

So she moved in with the meth fueled biker army, and they do alright to take care of her in all honesty. As good as a tweaker can I suppose. 

So I see her about once a week, because I hate going to the mobile home she's at due to the violence against white people there I am not exactly welcome you could say. Nonetheless, I make sure to speak with her often and see her when I can.

Now we're all caught up till about last week. 

She invites me over to meet her gay friend of 10 years, and I agree. He's annoying as hell but I ignore him and am just happy to spend time with my lady. But when I arrived the pair was wasted drunk, and since I was there her gma (let's call her D) puts me in charge of the mobile home while she is gone. I accept. Then her and her friend decide to steal Ds meth, and I don't put up a fuss about it. It's hard to understand her as it is, then add the liquor to the stroke jargon it's truly impossible for me to grasp anything she says the first few times. 

So we all get high and have a nice night overall. 10pm comes along and I leave after making sure she was tucked into bed. 

The next morning I wake up to my phone being blown the fuck up by D, and she tells me my lady's gay friend said I broke her Windows in to steal her meth and eveything that happened to her granddaughter is my fault. Like I put a gun to her head and made her steal my drugs just to flip my life upside down. 

I'm not happy about this, and we get into a serious argument over the phone. It doesn't go well. I end up deciding that war with the biker army isn't worth the trouble considering my lady is not the same person at all since the od. She acts like a 12yo, always sarcastic and rude. Always bitchy. So I tell her I love her more than the moon and stars but she really put me between a rock and a hard place. 

Now, we're at today. Up until today for the past week I have kept in contact with her for fear of her doing something awful to herself (suicide in some manner). But today she hits me up and sends me a bunch of pictures of this dude she wants to fuck and how much he loves her and blahblahblah. 

I was very offended by this. I always treated her well, and that's something I haven't been keen on as far women go in my past. 

The disrespect is fucking me up rn. 

So I wish her the best and tell her I'll always love her but I cannot be her friend anymore it's just too hard. 

I feel like I dodged the biggest bullet in my life and yet it still hurts like a son of bitch. 

Sorry this is so God Damn long. 

I don't expect this to be well received I just dont know where else to go and I figured this was relatable to this sub. 

To those of you who made it this far down. Thank you. I appreciate it. 

EDIT: Thank you all for your kind words, support and advice. I really can't believe the amount of awesome brothers and sisters on here who care about someone they don't know from atom. 

I'll be around in these parts if anybody would like to keep in touch. And those of you who took the time to PM me and go into detail on their woes and mine I will definitely keep in touch.

So, husband is going away for a little while. We bought him a stack for himself to have while he is gone considering he wont be able to pick up for a week or two. He will be staying with people who do not have a habit and do not know he does.

He would like, in theory, for me to cut time out of his daily shooting up routine by mixing up shots for him in advance. This concerns me because of a few things... will it be ""shelf stable""? Is there a huge chance for extreme bacterial growth? Anything else that should concern me? He wants me to mix it all up with water in some kind of container, out of which he would draw up a shot each time he would like one.

I apologize if this sounds stupid as hell, it may well be, but I worry. Also sorry if this has been asked before. I googled and searched, but didn't find much. I know it doesnt take TOO much time to mix up, but he is a little nervous about doing so in a shared space with these people. Ive already told him to just go and say youre taking a shower... but lord knows Id be nervous about it too.

Story/Timeline inside.","**SPOILER**: it's *un*chill

**5:45AM** - Feeling groggy and nauseated, joint pain amplified, I get up to pee and see my pupils dilated as fuck. I realize I've got just over an hour and a half before work, I half-asleep decide that that's a safe enough window and fumble for the loose suboxone films in my 7-day pill organizer. I stick 2 under my tongue and drift back off for a few minutes

**5:50AM** - The chemical-orange taste of the suboxone dissolving wakes me up again, and as I realize they're about 70% dissolved, my eyes fucking JOLT open and my heart literally palpitates/skips a beat

*""wait. NO. oh my god.* **OH MY FUCKING GOD**. *my foot isn't even tapping. i'm not even into the cold sweats‚Äîi'm probably still 6-7 hours from clean receptors.. what did I just do?""*

**6:10AM** - Pacing around and trying to convince myself that I had been sicker than I really was prior to dosing the subs, and that PWD wouldn't hit me (and if it did, it wouldn't be too hard and it would be over in time for work).

**6:25AM** - Pins and needles in my arms and legs, thin film of sweat manifests over my upper body, I lay down and throw a blanket over myself

**6:45AM** - I'm well and truly fucked. I postpone texting my boss and think back to some of these shitty stupid reddit posts I've read in the past about how PWD is more intense but only lasts an hour or so. At this point I'm still ignorantly planning/expecting to make it into work‚Äîif only feeling shitty and having to hide it.

**7:45AM** - Should have left for work 20 minutes ago, but can't get off the couch. My heart is racing, my skin is burning, I redose suboxone since I have no dope left or other opiates to take the edge off. I know the only way out is through. I text my boss that I'm sick.

The next 3 hours are spent rolling around in a restless sweaty haze. Tossing sheets off of me, and pulling them back on‚Äîreplacing my knee pillow maybe 30 times (fucking thing has a life of its own). I become lucid/present again at around 11:00AM and realize I'm through the worst of it, but I still feel like this:

Hey y‚Äôall, hope your tuesdays goin alright. So my friend had a bit of an overdose over Memorial Day weekend, and I kinda sorta did the same thing in the same spot a couple days later. Paramedics were involved both times, not my first rodeo, never fun of course. I‚Äôve had a few similar situations in the past and I‚Äôve never had to pay for the narcan or the ambulance or the hospital or anything. Neither of us even went to an ambulance either time, but we still received ‚Äúcare‚Äù I guess, briefly. 

My homie got a bill, though, at his folks place in another state, for this incident. Apparently they‚Äôre saying he needs to pay a ‚ÄúFirst Responder Fee‚Äù. We‚Äôve been trying to learn what we can about it without much luck, so I‚Äôm wondering if anyone here has experience with/knowledge about this. I haven‚Äôt got a bill (yet), really hoping I don‚Äôt get one, but I‚Äôm not feelin too hopeful there. Apparently him not being a California resident might have something to do with it, not sure how they‚Äôd pull that up though. 

I‚Äôve OD‚Äôd and been taken to the hospital in an ambulance and I even think I received a sort of bill for that at one point with like $0 owed somehow. I got surrounded by cops with guns and forced to go to the hospital in an ambulance last year, and I never had to pay for any of that either. Apparently these fees are a city thing though, so none of that necessarily means anything in this case. I can‚Äôt even find any info on this city actually charging these fees but homie got the bill from a collection agency already so, like, I guess they do.

Luckily it seems like it won‚Äôt be anything crazy, like $150 or something. That‚Äôll be pretty hard for me to swing in my current position but it‚Äôs doable. Really not sure what I‚Äôm gonna do if it‚Äôs like $500, my mom would def bail my ass out luckily but I really don‚Äôt wanna have to tell her her son (who‚Äôs supposedly clean on subs too fml) fuckin overdosed.

Supposedly it may be possible to get these fees waived somehow as well, so I‚Äôm holding onto some hope there if I do get hit with this bill.

8sc3ox,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8sc3ox/do_cuts_affect_a_high/,11,https://redd.it/8sc3ox,3nigma_,Do cuts affect a high?,"I made another post earlier today about caffeine and #3 H but I don't think people understood. Caffeine is by far THE most common cut in #3, this is because it makes it easier to chase the dragon on foil. So I was wondering if when you then smoke it off of the foil, does the caffeine enter your system as well?

I ask this as I'm high right now and this is one of those highs where I have a lot of energy and I feel really productive, I've smoked a lot and sometimes, depending on what I get, it's very sedating and sometimes it's much more energising.

I know for a fact that caffeine is added to #3 so my line of thinking is that those more energetic highs are from where there's a higher caffeine content and the more sedating ones are where there's a lower caffeine content.

I'm sure in America you guys get your stuff cut with something. Do you ever notice the cuts in your highs?

Is it possible that when I'm vaporising/smoking my H, I'm also doing the same to the caffeine it's been cut with, thus giving me a caffeine high(as much as you can call caffeine a high) as well?

I looked it up and normal bic lighters can reach up to 800  degrees Celsius, though normally they float around 300-400. The vaporisation temperature of caffeine is about 200 degrees, so surely it's possible?thoughts?

EDIT: Have any of you Americans felt a difference in high which you believe to be due to a cut?

EDIT 2: This is what made me think about it - the key thing that shows you have good H is when you run it on the foil there's no residue indicating little to no cuts that can't be  vaporised, and if there's no residue, then what happens to the cuts like caffeine?",1529439476.0

We all know that part of the biggest problem with opiate addiction is that the bad effects of withdrawals don't really appear until a while after your dose - 8-12 hours or so.  BUT, when you administer your favorite opiate while you are sick in the middle of withdrawal, you are immediately healed and your body builds a bond that see's the thing that got you sick initially as the cure, the antidote.  It doesn't have the ability to actually, at a subconscious level, associate the drugs with the sickness.  Great.  But did you ever wonder why when you are relapsing on your opiates, that the effects are not as desirable or as fun?  How many times have you relapsed when you were out of the woods with opiates only to go, ""that wasn't that great..."" and then you are back into your old habits. 

Well I think I figured out why.  When you are sick, the feeling of going from completely miserable to healed and then to high is a huge jump for us.  However, if we are already clean, that jump isn't as noticeable and doesn't seem that big.  That relief while being sick feels huge.

So let me say, Hello my friends. I hope you are all good and well. Sorry for the wall of text in advance. There's a tl;dr at the bottom.

I've recently decided to get my life together and quit my addictions. So about two months ago I quit taking benzos and have been on maintenance for my opiates. The road hasn't been easy but I feel like I've come a long way. As of right now, I really have no withdrawal symptoms but over the time I've been off everything, I've developed a noticable tremor. Mainly in my hands and its gotten to a point that it's starting to affect certain aspects of my life. Even just typing this out on my phone is a little difficult. Thank god for auto-correct, right? Another thing is that tremors actually run in my family. (There's a specific name for it but I don't want to be identified) My grandfather had them and passed it on to my father. The thing is though, in most cases they don't become evident until your 40's, which is still a ways a way for me. But it technically can develop at any age. My question is do you think this may be some kind of withdrawal? I mean, other than the tremors though, I'm fine. Or do you think I may have an early onset of the disorder. Maybe activated somehow through my drug use? The main thing that's strange is how it progressed after I quit. I mean, since my late teen years I would get a slight tremor from drinking even the smallest amount of coffee or when I was really tired but before this I can't say I ever really noticed much. I know 99% of you have no idea about genetic disorders so I'm mainly asking about your experience with benzodiazepines and/or opiate withdrawal and their link to tremors. Any personal experience would be greatly appreciated.

Im the person without the gaming console i sold it and i kind of have zero dollars saved up. 8:00 am i get woke up by bendernod. I think to myself he never calls this ealy so i answer.

bendernod ""did i wake you up""

me (sizzle)- "" yeah your good just tell me whats  cracking""

bendernod ""i was up all night in *locatiom removed* @heroin el chapo basketball nodding court of drugs** with these hoes dopefiends and dealers had a good night on coke and spent about $250 on just coke and one of the hoes shoots heroin into her arm with a needle. shortly after i asked  if i could buy some! She (kayla)-""yeah baby um here!"" she breaks out some black tar. i asked kayla if she i need to crush it up good because im gonna snort it"" kayla replied calmly yes and she procedded to light up some crack. so sizzle i snorted some and i was feeling real good but it was just a tease. asked Kayla for another bump she said do u have money im out. i gave her $85 and she used my phone and 4am and the dealer came and only kayla met her plug and by 5am i had some heroin. i put it on my scale on top of a $20 bill it weighed .1 so i figured she ripped me of and this would hardly get me high so i went home and  it was 6 am by now. i showerd and ate and laid in bed and figured 8 am was good enough to call you. can i come over""

sizzle- ""yeah pull up gang""

bendernod got here about 2 hours ago and showed me the heroin. reddit gang i believe my friend bought fentanyl!!  after getting the solid like heroin chunk out of the bag. it was pure white!

i explained thats fentanyl and its a good thing he showed up here so i could show him how to use it.

the whole white chunk did weigh 100mg after weighing on my scale to. 

I break bendernod of 6mg bump of this fentanyl and he snorts it up.5 minutes later bendernod feels very good he told me and gets all happy and thanks me explaining how lucky he is to have a kind friend like me and he offers me a bump. i do 12mg because i been doing east coast heroin the past week. and he does 4mg more and he starts nodding.

im glad bendernod had a good time he is still here and it was his idea for me to use reddit. if u want to ask us anything fire away we are gonna watch tv and try and get high. he is on my phone all the time because i trust him. 

questions from me and bendernod. if the reddit gang has a minute to help us out that would me nodsome!! <nod+ awesome> lol

we like any type of music. anyone have a youtube playlist they wanna share?

we have no job so we want to save as much heroin as possible. any tips. bendernod said the dealer told him to take a 20mg bump and lay down flat on back with head up quickly right after snorting a tiny bit for 30 minutes! dealer claims this will save money and promises it will seriously get us very very high if we snort h and lay down on back for 30.

thats pretty much it. we just wanna know if snorting small bumps and laying on back for 30 minutes will get us really high like the dealer saiid!

me and bendernod thank u for reading happy nods and stay high stay positive. throw out the hate and become great. stay safee

I feel mostly physically fine although my back is really acting up which got me to relapse in the first place after I was rear ended by another car. And the cravings are killing me mixed with the pain.

This is from about 5 years ago.

Now, I used to have a ""friend"" named Kevin. I know it's a meme to hate on people named Kevin, but I really didn't care for this dude, and his name really is Kevin. I still hung out with him though because his mom gave him her script of K-pins and he was an alcoholic so he would share all his shitty vodka with me. When we hung out I was basically also an alcoholic. I'd occasionally have some pills or dope or something and sometimes his neighbor would sell us random opiates. It was a friendship made solely for getting completely shit faced together.

One night we were getting wasted and popping some K-pins, as usual. There may or may not have been opiates, I can't really remember; the benzos made most of these nights pretty hazy. I'm not sure exactly why we went, but we ended up going to Wal-Mart at 4am. So, I drove there completely wrecked, but surprisingly i drove fairly well from what I can recall. Luckily the store was only a 10 minute drive from Kevin's house.

We were walking through the store and I had a razor blade in my pocket for cutting up dope/oxy. This was right around the time I started banging and I know I definitely didn't have needles that night. Well, when I'm on benzos I have zero inhibitions, so I impulsively started slashing all the bicycle tires in the toy section, obviously. After I had rendered a few flat I fucked up and accidentally sliced open the palm of my hand. I started bleeding everywhere.

I immediately walked to the pharmacy, leaving a trail of blood behind like Hansel and Gretel's breadcrumbs. When I got there I opened up a pack of bandages and some medical tape then bandaged myself up to stop the bleeding. I think I just threw the opened packages on the floor and walked away.

I knew we should probably leave after that so I swung by electronics and pocketed a spool of 100 blank DVDs, for some reason. I didn't even burn DVDs anymore, instead opting to use my laptop as a media server to stream all my movies to my PS3 (now PS4). But if I'm in a store and on benzos I'm going to steal something, no matter how pointless.

We got the hell out of there and I drove back home at 5am as school buses were taking all the kids to school. We made it back safe somehow and continued drinking. I still have no idea how I didn't get arrested and I have no fucking clue why I went to Wal-Mart in the first place.

I have to wonder though what they did when they saw the blood all over the store. Of course they cleaned it up, but surely someone would have checked the security tapes, right? Oh well, just another story on my list of why I no longer take benzos recreationally. Come to think of it, i don't really drink anymore either.

My girlfriend had never done opioids. Then, this past weekend, she got her hands on Percocet, and she's never really done drugs. It wasn't out of being stuck up or some weird backwards view on it, she was just never really interested, and was fine with her occasional drink. She's smoked weed twice I think, and didn't like it that much.

Little background on her, she's depressed, and is diagnosed with a few anxiety disorders, one of them is OCD. I was scared of her ever trying opes because I had a feeling she'd like em way too much. More than me. Anywho, she told me she wanted to take these percs, and I even had a strong gut urge to stay away from them. I didn't want her to do them either, I didn't want the withdrawal for her, I didn't want the fiending, and turns out, this would be the third day in a row of her doing them, she just wanted to do them with me. She promised not to do them ever again afterwards, and I figured that, what the hell, its 15mg of oxycodone, last time, she doesn't have access to more, whatever, and I've fought off the fiending before, I'll do it again to be on her level.

This was my fault and my mistake. I cut her lines. I taught her how to snort it. Turns out, she was planning to take her life after I left, and this was kind of on her bucket list. She didn't because I stayed longer than I had planned, and she couldn't do it.

I feel as though if she had never met me, she would've never even known what an opioid was, or how to do it, or what it did. I feel fucking awful. I don't know what to do. I've been lurking this sub for a while, and you guys have always seemed supportive of each other. I know I'm a dumbass, I know I fucked her up, I know I shouldn't have done it. But I did it all anyways. How do I stop? Does this fiending shit ever end? How do I help her?

My girlfriend sold alcohol to a minor. My girlfriend swears that the person was over 21 and it must of been a fake ID. 

They didn't arrest her but they made her come down to the police station the next day and gave her a paper to go to court (its 2 misdemeanors I'm not sure which level) 

Anyways im just sitting up tonight worried of what could happen when she goes to court July 2nd. 

She's also on probation in Utah, but she doesn't have a probation officer, doesnt drug test and they really don't give a shit about anything except her paying the court every month and doing 5 hours of community service a month.

I've suffered from treatment-resistant depression for over half of my life. (I'm 30 years old.) Since I was 24, I've taken many different anti-depressants including nearly all the SSRIs, SNRIs, Remeron (mirtazipine), Wellbutrin, pramipexole, and even an MAOI, Nardil (phenelzine). None of these worked. I stuck with 30mg of Remeron because it at least helped me sleep.

I had my wisdom teeth removed at 25. My dentist gave me a prescription for Percocet. This totally eliminated my depression and anxiety. I knew about the risks of addiction, but I quickly ran out of the Percs before any physical or mental addiction was able to take hold.

I started using a small amount of kratom to aid in the withdrawal from Percocets that I was on for 9 months. Then, sure enough, I found an excuse to use kratom all the time. After a year of it, I quit it cold turkey and the withdrawal was almost as difficult.

So now I'm clean and have been for months. I don't drink alcohol or any sugary drinks. I don't smoke. I exercise a lot. I get some sunlight every day. I eat well (lots of salads, nuts & seeds, chicken, and fish). I take all of the recommended supplements, including tyrosine in the morning, a good multivitamin, niacin, vitamin d, biotin, 5-HTP & GABA, LOTS of high EPA fish oil, zinc, magnesium, and melatonin at night, but I'm still depressed, anxious, and deeply anhedonic. The anhedonia in particular is killing me - nothing seems interesting to me. I know that it takes months to feel better after drug abuse, but it has already been several months and I'm not feeling any better.

So now I'm at a difficult crossroad. I started to read articles about ""Reward Deficiency Syndrome"" and think that I and many other people who don't respond to traditional antidepressants may have it. Here's a link to a good Psychology Today article explaining what this is: https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/addicted-brains/201308/when-the-thrill-is-gone-reward-deficiency-syndrome

Even though the theory still needs to be worked out, the basic idea is that, for whatever reason, my brain simply doesn't have enough dopamine D2 receptors, and, because of this, I have to supplement my brain with extra dopaminergic/endorphin-boosting drugs just in order to feel normal, otherwise nothing is enjoyable to me and is not worth pursuing. This might be why normal antidepressants just don't work on me. My issue isn't with serotonin or norepinephrine or even dopamine. My brain's reward system is just messed up.

I talked about this with my psychiatrist about this and, considering that I've been through every class of antidepressant medication, she is seriously considering putting me on an ultra low dose of Suboxone (buprenorphine/naloxone), even though this is controversial in psychiatry. When I say ultra low dose, I mean .5mg of Suboxone. The smallest dose of Suboxone they make is 2mg; I'd have to cut the already tiny sublingual Suboxone strip into even smaller quarters.

My psychiatrist knows about my past substance use and she is understandably very hesitant, as am I. I asked my psychiatrist if perhaps I should microdose with kratom instead and she said that while she might be supportive of the idea, kratom is likely different from batch to batch and that I might not know how to dose. With Suboxone, I'll be able to to titrate where, with kratom, I'll have a much more difficult time. So now I appeal to you guys to see what you think.

Should I take the ultra low dose Suboxone (.5mg) or should I microdose with kratom (from .25g to 1g)? Or should I do something else entirely?

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! :)",1529378837.0

Everybody hates not getting as high as desired... where he wanted to be. Especially, when the reason isn‚Äòt the lack of the substances you want to get into your bloodstream, but more likely to the naloxone  Pharma companies added to your favourite snacks. 
 
Yes, i‚Äòm talking about naloxone. Here is my thought on how to ‚Äûkind of‚Äú get to some kind of solution

I recently thought a lot about reducing, not quite eleminating the Nalaxon from combined medications like the well known Products containing Oxycodone and Naloxone and a relatively unknown one, since it‚Äôs more common in Germany and Belgium only - Tilidin/naloxone

As far as my research took me, oxycodone  and Tilidin are easily soluable in ethanol, while naloxone only slightly is. 
So using a quite similar way as people use to wash stuff with acetone out of their speed, it should at least be a way to significantly decrease the amount of Naloxone that was inside the perfectly crushed tablets before. 
It‚Äòs similar to caffeine. It‚Äòs poorly soluble in acetone, so most, but not all of it is gone after the cleaning of it 

Since naloxone becomes orally active when taken 25-35mg , that would be quite handy. 
Dosage Oxy (Targin 20/10) now is 50, to be on the safe site with the naloxone . 
Since I have a tolerance, it  does nothing for me. 
When it comes to the max. Dosage of 350-400mg  Tilidin (Extended but crushed and parachuted) due to the 28-32 mg naloxone  contained, I can‚Äôt just take more. 
First pass metabolism kills most of the naloxone orally since 97-99% won‚Äôt get into your bloodstream. 
But at 25-35 mg most people feel the rush to weaken and when reaching 35/40mg Naloxone or more, most people instantly feel plain sober. 
So here is what I found so far.., 

Solubility of oxy 

‚ÄûNearly insol in ether, water, potassium and sodium hydroxid. 

Insoluble in water; soluble in ethanol, chloroform
[Lide, D.R. CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics 86TH Edition 2005-2006. CRC Press, Taylor & Francis, Boca Raton, FL 2005, p. 3-410] **PEER REVIEWED**‚Äú

Solubility of tilidine: 

Physicochemistry
It usually comes in its hydrochloride hemihydrate salt form; in this form it is highly soluble in water, ethanol and dichloromethane and appears as a white/almost white crystalline powder.[3] Its storage is restricted by its insensitivity to light and sensitivity to degradation by oxygen, hence necessitating its storage in amber bottles and at temperatures below 30 degrees Celsius, respectively.[1][3]


And finally naloxone : 

Water Solubility Soluble in water (73 mg/ml), ethanol (3.3 mg/ml), methanol (50 mg/ml) and dimethyl sulfoxide (73 mg/ml). Insoluble in ether

My question is, how realistic my thought of just reducing the naloxone in the formula simply by using a small but not too tiny amount of ethanol  to solve the Tilidin or oxy in it while just some of the naloxone will be solved in it, run it through a coffee Filter and let it dry. 
Maybe repeat once or twice. 

Besides, I assume the ethanol should be as dry as it has to be when it comes to washing amphetamines with dry acetone, right? Same procedure to dry it? 

I won‚Äôt get rid of all the naloxone, but even half of it would allow me to double my dose, so I can actually get the nice active Rush from the Tilidin or make use of all the 20/10 oxy/naloxone that are widely available in my area,  means I‚Äòm aware there won‚Äôt be snorting or anything else. Just the good ol‚Äò swallowing pils 

Thanks if you read until now.

So it all started a few years ago. It began with a prescription of clonazepam. I realized that I could have fun if I took a few more than prescribed.

Then I realized if i smoke some weed while high on clonazepam it was really fun. 

~Fast forward through the psychedelic experimentation phase~ 

It didn‚Äôt take long for me to get my hands on hydrocodone. I had heard and read about the high, and I decided I wanted to try it. So I downed a few 5/325 hydros and I was on top of the world. I had no real connect to get pills from, so hydros were a rare but welcomed commodity. But I loved the way they felt. It was the one drug that I didn‚Äôt need to also have weed to enjoy. 

I continued to mostly smoke weed, and occasionally try other substances, mdma, shrooms, Xanax, you name it. 

One day I make friend with these two guys. Well call them Fred, and Robert. Fred was a pretty straight edge guy. Had smoked weed, done acid once, nothing crazy. Robert on the other hand had two brothers who sold cocaine up in the city that we lived near. So he had a bit more experience. Well once I became good friends with these guys, I decided I wanted to try coke. So we drove up to his brothers place and had a badass coke fueled night. 

Well, these brothers sold cocaine, but they also enjoyed heroin. They didn‚Äôt do it often, and didn‚Äôt seem like junkies, but they had access to it, and like a dumbass I decided I wanted to try it.

Where I lived the highest purity shit on the streets was tar. The lower purity shit was gunpowder, basically a tiny bit of tar that was mixed with a shit load of inert powder. So I started with monkey water, snorted it, felt the heroin, but it wasn‚Äôt all that amazing. I tried it a couple times after this, also snorting, and I got really high, but didn‚Äôt see how it was so amazing and addictive..

It was all fun and games until the day I decided to buy a fresh pack of syringes from the Walmart pharmacy. Biggest mistake I ever made. That night me and Robert went up to his brothers. We got some decent quality H, not the best, but strong enough for naive dumbasses like me. So I get one of the brothers to help me shoot up, took a second for him to find my vein, but he did find it. 

I watched as the needle entered my arm, I watched as the dark red blood was registered within, and I watched as the semi-clear, dark brown liquid slowly entered my vein, and suddenly I was in heaven. It took maybe about 30 seconds before I was so fucked up I thought I was going to die. I threw my guts up, but at the same time it was the best fucking high of my entire life. I will never reach that level of ecstasy ever again in my life. It was amazing, and I was hooked... 

I will write about my story in more detail if you guys are interested, I just wanted to share some of it.

Started doing Tramadols and Tapentadols, but have fully reverted back to heroin after only one month. I started to see flashbacks of my life before getting clean last summer, and it scared me shitless. 

My girlfriend(19F) of 7 months knew about my addiction when we started dating, but I had been a couple months clean when we got together, and she has been so supportive of me and believes I am a strong person for admitting my struggles and not pitying myself. I just told her I have been hiding my relapse from her, and we had an emotional last night, but it was out of care for each other, not anger. She promised me she will always be there for me, as long as I trust her enough to tell her anything.

I decided to fix my addiction temporarily because I am swamped with full time work and online classes. Went to a methadone clinic for the first time ever and got a 40mg dose. I feel happy and motivated, but fuck me this methadone feels like a long acting heroin peak. I feel like I enoy this stuff a little too much, but this will only be a temporary fix until I can clear my schedule for outpatient support. 

My girlfriend and I will go to NA meetings every Wednesday, start going back to church, and she is going to stop doing drugs along with me(she does alcohol valium and hexen occasionally). It's always a big help when you can work with someone through an addiction phase. The MMP(Methadone Maintenance Program) has alleviated any cravings for pain, but I feel like this could become my new dope habit if I stay on it for too long, so I am going to keep doing this program for only 4 months, enough to get me to have more free time to go to a treatment program and taper the methadone. Maybe I don't even need to go if the program is successful in stability, then tapering.

This is my first time doing methadone programs. Does anyone have any warnings about this stuff? I know there is a lot of negative stigma and unwarranted suspicion about methadone, but it is still an opiate, so the stigma has some truth to it possibly. I don;t want to be a lifetime methadone addict if possible.",1529344582.0

All in all, I think it was a necessary experience. It made me feel like the best version of myself - confident, anarchistic, laid back, and in a constant state of relief. 

But it also brought me down to my knees - luckily I wasn‚Äôt doing it for long or else I think personally it‚Äôd be inevitable that I‚Äôd end up in jail or OD‚Äôd. It was just too sweet, there‚Äôs not much I wouldn‚Äôt have done for that fix.

I decided to quit after seeing how disgusting my track marks looked and how much money I wasted yet still being sick a few days out of the month. I‚Äôm glad I got out of it. It‚Äôs consuming in such a perplexing way - where you don‚Äôt realize your soul‚Äôs depleting and you aren‚Äôt that ‚Äúperfect self‚Äù it gave you the illusion of being. Matter of fact, in my reflections I‚Äôm realizing that those traits have been mine with or without dope. 

Regardless, it was definitely all it‚Äôs hyped up to be - especially speedballing. And my thirsty curiosity for such a potent high has been quenched. At 22 years old, I‚Äôve had the opportunity to try every notable drug (not many research chems) and feel like the experiences were interesting and powerful enough to allow me to stay sober until I‚Äôm old albeit some weed of course.",1529336812.0

It isnt working.,"Today is 27 days clean from opiates and that's huge for me. Yesterday I threw always my relaspe stash of 2 press Roxie's and half of yellow opana because I knew I didn't think I was going to this time and it felt like that little league home run I never hit. 
Everytime I have tried to stop I always kept some for when I knew I would ''need'' it. Stupid I know.

I have fallen into a phenibut, baclofen, gaba, Xanax and wine person ever since I have quit taking opiates. Being completely sober isn't what I want in life right now but that is a pretty good combo to still be functional as long as the Xanax dose isnt above 2mg. Of course none of this is healthy to take all at once but that isn't what I'm going for and that wasn't the main reason I quit taking opates. I'm just trying to get threw life a little less high. Life may be more hazy but I'm less high for sure. The plan is the slowly get off these substances and maybe lower the Xanax and wine usage some.
 
Everything is fent or really expensive if it's real in NW Florida and it's bullshit doing 3 pharma 30s and not getting well from them because of the fake roxy habbit. I've never really done dope consistently because I hate going threw people to get shit and alot of our shit looks like grey and is so inconsistent sometimes you need narcan, sometimes you can snort a half gram and be sick. I'm sure it's just the junkies I know the their dope is shit and presses blow it out of the water. 
But...

What is your favorite non-opiate related med?
What do you use daily?

Also do you find it hard to not take opiates while not being sober from other substances or easier because at least you are doing something?

And will the using dreams ever stop? Fuck.. almost every dream I find a huge bag of assorted pills but I can never do them or break them down or anything before I wake up. That shit is stressful. 

I also am interested in tianeptine because I have a fucked up arm and I can't really grip or lift anything over 15lbs and the amount of nsaids im taking with the wine is destroying my ulcer and chrons disease which I never noticed really before like I do now. Using wine as a pain killer isn't really working as well as I hoped.   I know tianeptine is technically an antidepressant but it also apparently kills pain slightly and that's all I'm looking for. I also don't know if taking this will make me crave opiates more than I already do. Part of me thinks I shouldn't add anything to the gaba mixture. 

I tired to talk to a sub Dr almost a month ago and since I wasn't using at the time and was 4 days clean I didn't qualify. I was told this program since it is on the cheaper side only takes people in withdrawals or using so that is out of the question as of right now. 

Part of me want to go back to my old Dr and get the 90 15mg oxys back but i know they will only last 4 or 5 days and I'll be right back where I was a month ago. 

Trying to not take opiates while physically fucked is tough and I know it will be extremely metally tough if I tried it sober. 

I never do uppers but apparently it has made me talkative today. ",1529334758.0

I feel for myself- whenever I use opiates my mind is clear and I can focus a lot better on the task at hand. Whenever I‚Äôm sober, of course I have the same capabilities, but I find myself struggling to focus on what is currently in front of me.

I‚Äôve tried Adderall and other adhd medications but I‚Äôve had no luck with them. Whenever I‚Äôm on opiates I can get shit done; tedious tasks where I‚Äôd otherwise lack motivation to complete. I understand I could most likely train myself to achieve this same level of productivity without the opiates but I‚Äôve found they really aid me in doing so.

My job is extremely boring, without giving out tmi, the people I work with are on avg 30 years older than me and they tell me I‚Äôm literally the youngest man in the city doing what I do. I‚Äôve stayed high throughout the entirety of my employment here and I‚Äôve discovered that the few times I‚Äôve sobered up my productivity has hit a steep decline.

I may no be using the right words to describe exactly what I mean but does anyone understand what I‚Äôm saying or feel the same way?


EDIT: despite popular opinion I feel the need to clarify to you all that I am not saying this to brag. I was looking to see if anyone here felt the same. When I‚Äôm sober I feel alone. I‚Äôm 27 years old and I‚Äôm reaching my mental prime. I feel so fucking aware of everything when I‚Äôm sober; sometimes paralyzed with the anxiety from everything that I see.

I reacted out of anger that everyone was attacking me. I‚Äôm not fucking saying this shit to be against y‚Äôall. I‚Äôm with y‚Äôall. I was just looking for someone who could understand what it‚Äôs like. The opiates give me clarity because they dull my mind. I don‚Äôt want to see everything that I see. Regardless of whether you‚Äôre ‚Äúreligious‚Äù or not, I know this is for a reason.

I don‚Äôt care who thinks I‚Äôm a genius I just used the word to get the attention of someone who can relate to this. I know there are other highly intelligent people out there who use drugs and I wanted to speak with them. This is nothing against someone of average or lesser intelligence.

EDIT 2: throughout my years of drug use (13 years) I‚Äôve sobered up for long periods of time at a time; sometimes even years. When I was sober I never felt like myself. Often times I would go weeks (literally) without sleeping. This lead me to feel fucking insane and angry all the time because I couldn‚Äôt focus on my work. When I started using opiates I was finally able to get some fucking work done. This is what I really mean.

EDIT 3: By genius I don‚Äôt mean an astrophysicist or even someone proficient in calculus. An example of what I mean is- take a look at rapper 6ix9ine. Someone with a narrow mind may say ‚Äúhe‚Äôs an idiot, he‚Äôs bad for the youth‚Äù, etc., etc. but if you look at him from a different lenses you can see that the character itself (of 6ix9ine) is genius. Rap has been the same for as long as rap has been around but this new generation is changing it. The guy colors his hair rainbow- for attention, says crazy things- for attention and then people check out his music (which actually grows on you.) If I need to go into more detail here I will but I‚Äôm getting lazy and I hope you can understand the point I‚Äôm making.",1529331155.0

My first time posting (long time lurker). I have a question: 
Have any of you ever used deep dark web to find stuff? I am not trying to source (I know you can‚Äôt do that), just wanting to know how often do people use the the dark web to find stuff? Like people who just use and are not dealers? 
I got sucked in by the interwebs earlier and somehow ended up reading about the dark web and all that fun jazz.

During my addiction, I ruined relationships with not only my friends but with my community at large due to the ripple effects of heroin addiction stigma.  About half of my good friends, one by one, got into dope, and the other half stayed away and stopped speaking to the ones who started using.  The users very quickly stopped speaking to one another.

Fives years gone, two are clean, two are dead, one is still using and no one is talking to one another.  Our good buddy and one of my best friends passed of an overdose this past Spring.  I did not feel it was my place to go to the funeral... his family hates us.  None of the other users and none of the other clean folk went either.  And so I mourned in my apartment by myself, to my friend's life and to all the wasted years.

And it's two months after the fact and I still can't get over it.  Even though we all kind of hate one another, I just want to get together with my childhood friends and laugh and toast our dead buddy for one last time.  But it won't happen, and I'm stuck with a sickness on part of my soul that kills part of it a little more each day, to the point where I have pushed its screams so far down I can barely hear them.",1529295011.0

8rwey5,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8rwey5/story_time_pure_alprazolam_powder_from/,13,https://redd.it/8rwey5,Aspecpro,Story time!! (Pure alprazolam powder from Czechoslovakia + Heroin),"      So here's a crazy story that happened in my past. I'm flowing on suboxone, gabapentin and phenibut , and feel like writing out a true tale from my past. 

      I was around 20 years old. I was living for the moment, free of anxiety of consequence. It just happens when you're younger and on drugs. I had recently acquired a job working at a deli in a supermarket in my area. 

    The night before, I was at a friend's place that was about a 30 minute drive from my house. He had just bought pure alprazolam powder from the DN, and let me tell you this shit was real. I remember insufflating a very tiny line, maybe a couple of grains of salt, and feeling barred out the night before. I bought some of his powder and drove home and got home around 11PM to midnight.  (Warning: operating a vehicle under the influence of benzodiazepines is NOT recommended and I don't condone it!) I don't really know how much I bought in terms of weight, because I didn't and still don't own a miligram scale. 

        Fast forward to the next morning. The time is around 8AM. I don't remember going to sleep, but I do remember waking up and feeling VERY good and free. With work coming up in about an hour or so, I came up with the great idea to snort more alprazolam before work, ya know, just to insure I have a great day! I actually snorted the entire content of the bag, which was still a small line about the size of the cotton tip of a Q-tip. It might've been around 8mg to 10mg. 

           I get to work at around 9:30 and I'm a fucking mess lol. I remember I was dropping rotisserie chickens in their case on the ground, picking them back up, and putting them back on the rotisserie lol. So after fucking up for a bit, I decide to quit the job. Right on the spot, I walked up to the manager fearlessly as fuck, and told her I had another job on the line, and that I'm done working there, see ya, bye. She was pissed, but I walked out.

             I decided that now that I was free of that bitch ass job, it was time to get high and get some dope and spend the rest of the day blissed the fuck out. The time is around 11AM. But wait, I don't have any money. Hmmmm.....I KNOW! I'll go into the parking lot of the store that I just quit, and ask their customers for money. Great idea! But first I need a plan, what should I tell them to get their money? I decided it would be best to stay in my work outfit, and tell people I just got laid off from the job, and needed some money for gas to get home, because this store was so evil that they left me on the street with nowhere to go and no money. I kept this gig up until I made $55. Yes, i made $55 in about 30 minutes doing this. 

             Of course, this was making a scene though. Some customers went in and told the manager what I was doing in the parking lot, which got him kind of pissed. So, I WENT BACK IN THE FUCKING STORE AND WALKED TO THE CUSTOMER SERVICE STATION, ASKED FOR THE PHONE TO CALL MY DOPEMAN, AND STARTED COUNTING ALL THE $1S AND $5S I COLLECTED FROM THEIR CUSTOMERS. The dopeman said he'd meet me in the parking lot at the store (I left out the situation and ruckus I just caused in the parking lot...) 

             The manager found me, and started yelling to me from literally the other side of the store. This part is a blur, but all I remember is yelling ""I'M DEPRESSED, PLEASE DON'T CALL THE COPS, I'M LEAVING, I'M HAVING A HARD TIME) (lol imagine this happening) 

           Anyway, I meet my dopeman in his raggedy, beatup, diarrhea colored Buick in the parking lot, buy the dope, and drive home to my house (Yes, I had gas this whole time hehe)  The time is around 12PM. 

         I got 6 bags i think. They were good bags too. White, flakey, almost candy-smelling heroin, with a little whiff of Vitamin B12 and bacon as for the smell as well. Weird combination. Anyway, I think I shot up 2 or 3 bags, and must've made a PB&J sandwich and a bowl of cereal after shooting them. My mom told me she walked by my room, and saw me sitting in my computer chair with my head back, a half a sandwich sitting on my chest, a bite of sandwich in my mouth, and milk and cereal all over the floor. She claims she woke me up, and walked me over to the futon to lay down. I don't remember any of this part at all. 

         Some time after this, I must've woken up and decided to finish the rest of my dope, because the last thing I remember is waking up on the futon waaaaay later in the day. The time was 7PM. 

         I wake up laying on my stomach on my futon, groggy as FUCK, feeling like a truck hit me. I'm talking benz'd the fuck out, with no recollection of even getting out of bed this morning. I lift my head up, and see an uncapped syringe laying under my chest, and a dried trail of blood on my left forearm. I sit up with my head spinning. My mom comes in the room with a look that spelled out a mix of worry, shock, and confusion. 
          ""Do you know what you did today?"" She asked in a normal voice, not yelling or talking down to me or anything. 
        ""Uhhhhh, no?"" I answered. I was actually being honest, because I didn't know. 
        ""You went to work, quit your job, somehow got incredibly fucked up, and passed out with a sandwich laying on your stomach and a bowl of cereal spilled all over the floor!"" She exclaimed. 
             It all hit me like a ton of bricks. The entire recollection of that day burrowed into my brain at that moment like a Madagascar cockroach. 
           ""Whooaaa, I really did. Holy shit. What the fuck??? How???"" I said, completely perplexed with my actions. 

        From that moment forward, I learned to respect the ultimate authority and power that is pure alprazolam powder. I had officially roofied myself.

i was in rehab and i relapsed on heroin. it looked like heroin. it smelled like heroin. it felt weak, but the rush was pretty fucking great. the drug test results came back as hydromorphone and some other ""hydro"" drugs. but no 6-acetylmorphine on the list.

my question is: the fuck was in my heroin? 

does heroin metabolise into hydromorphone? ",1529273145.0

I remember crying on the front step as he loaded his shit into the car. I asked him not to leave, that I loved him, and he said ""I promise I'll be back and everything will be okay"". He never came back, and things were far from OK. For years I hated him, blamed him for being an addict. But now he is the only parent I have left. We speak occasionally, I send him pictures of my children he doesn't know. And now I've come to forgive him as much as I can. I spent years hating him, and those years were wasted. I got nothing from them. And now he is sick and will die soon, and I will never know him, and he will never know me.

I know a lot of your relationships with your parents are strained. But when their gone, their gone. They are the only parents you will have. Call them, tell them you love them. Visit them. Learn from my mistakes.",1529268962.0

Well, it just so happens that it has an active O-demethylated metabolite that's like 200 times more potent of an opiate. That's a big difference.  


However, you can't get as much of this O-demethylated metabolite without a certain special CYP2D6 inhibitor.  
What could this be, I wonder? Well, that's what I need you to find out. I need someone to try using propranolol, Atarax, or nefazodone to see if there's a marked difference in tramadol's psychoactivity.  


Please be precise.",1529266785.0
