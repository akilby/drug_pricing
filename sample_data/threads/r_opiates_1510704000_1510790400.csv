Many of the negative effects, especially those we experience as dependent individuals occurs due to tolerance, dose escalation and downregulation of the endogenous opioid system (fewer, less sensitive MOPs) and an increase in the level of signalling from other excitatory neurochemical pathways. 
Acute withdrawal is often the result of an upregulated overactive noradrenergic system combined with increased glutamatergic neurotransmission. These develop rapidly and are lost rapidly (although when withdrawing a week of the brain downregulating these upregulated systems in response to acute opioid withdrawal seems anything but rapid). 

It has been shown that many of the downstream compensatory pathways that are activated in response to chronic opioid use are triggered by opioid receptor internalisation.  Morphine, Heroin, Fentanyl all bind to the MOP causing its phosphorylation and eventual internalisation (as well as releasing a G-Protein from the complex leading to the positive subjective opioid effects. 

TRV130 is an opioid optimised for maximum G-Protein signalling (pain relief, sedation, euphoria) and minimal beta-arrestin2 signalling (internalisation, tolerance and physical dependence). 

It doesn’t feel like morphine to take, nor does it sedate as much as Fentanyl. I have used it to replace my entire Fentanyl and morphine usage for the last 2 days and have not suffered any WD or ill effects. Nor have I had to escalate the dose. 
I plan to continue the experiment for the rest of the week. 

Please take some time to read the [link](http://www.trevena.com/pdf/ChenetalJMedChem2013_TRV130leadop.pdf) to see how this opioid with unique and possibly very positive features for those dependent, in pain requiring excessive opioid doses due to tolerance and for those new opioid users in acute leading to chronic pain that may avoid rapid dose escalation and tachyphylaxis with this interesting almost licenced chemically unique opioid drug. 
There is also a Wikipedia article for TRV130 which contains less information but may be more accessible to everyone. 

(When licensed, if not before, this drug is bound for schedule 2, so any others interested in synthesis out there, the enclosed paper will also sure give you some ideas on how to modify TRV130, once scheduled, to produce legal analogs (until those get scheduled also), as it did for myself)

I lost the crooks of my arms, and I have a really hard time hitting other veins for no particular reason (I have really good veins too). I live in NJ so my dope is ECP (powder) and the veins in my forearm have a lot of scar tissue so they're pretty hardened and sore.

I couldn't hit any other vein so I went to my left forearm which I've left alone for a few days (really didn't want to use it but I'm desperate). I drew a tiny bit of blood, tried to dig around for some more blood and got some more to the point where I felt comfortable. I injected just a little bit - it didn't burn at all (it usually would, and I've missed a tiny drop with this same dope and it'll burn if I missed), so I kept going little by little until it was all gone. In the back of my mind I don't feel like I registered well enough, but it didn't burn at all, everything was fine after, and all was well. I didn't really feel the rush I usually feel, but I had also done a lot an hour prior to this one, and was just doing these 2 bags to get  as much of a nod as I could.

If I press to where the vein is, right before the scar tissue that I'm trying to avoid is, there is the tiniest of tiny bumps (where I IV'd). You have to press to feel it and it's barely noticeable. Doesn't hurt, isn't warm, isnt swollen, isn't red at all: nothing. But for some reason I still have some gut feeling that I missed.

So, the reason for this post is - can I still have missed even though I didn't experience any of the burning/symptoms of a miss? Does it always go the same way? Or did I just get lucky and I was registered enough to get it all in there without a problem?


TLDR ---- feel like I missed a shot but there wasn't any pain/burning, no symptoms, no redness, no swelling, no lumps/bumps, no nothing - I did register SOMEWHAT but I just kind of pulled the trigger on a whim because I was frustrated. Can you still miss without experiencing any symptoms? Would be the first shot I ever fully missed.",1510726917.0

It's crazy to think of how far I've come. Moved over 1000 miles away from my home state to a warmer land, winter has never been better. I weighed 130 pounds in May at my worst as a daily IV heroin/meth addict (6 foot 2 inch tall male) and I have gained 60 pounds !  I also have maintained the same job for 6 months and recently purchased a car registered and insured in my name. I'm registered for college in January and of course getting high still has it's appeal. But after going to an NA meeting tonight it just doesn't feel like an option.

Know that you can quit, it takes some courage and pain getting through the withdrawals, but in the end if you are REALLY sick and tired of being sick and tired, there are so many good rehabs in US, Canada, Europe, etc if that is an option. It worked wonders for me.

Not sure if I can do this but if anyone is in the American South West, there's a drug/alcohol treatment program I live at that is phenomenal. It's a ranch outside of town with animals and around 30-35 dudes at any given time that CARE a lot about their sobriety. The awesome thing is that it's a mere $700 a month which includes food and rent and treatment. Thats a steal compared to other programs charging thousands.

Or at least I thought.. If you dont Im about to really help you out!! Enjoy,"So I just recently saw a post somewhere with a picture of a pill and someone asking if it were fake or not, and I'm not gonna lie this kind of blew my mind.  First that people are still trying to detect if pills are fake or not by looking at it (which I guess can help sometimes but others its impossible and the fakes look better than the real ones) and the fact that by not knowing how to test for this and the current situation of the market these days that its ridiculous and I can only imagine how many times you've been ripped off and will continue to get ripped off, so I thought I'd share this method I learned, and hopefully it will help you guys out in detecting fakes just as much as its helped me.  Enjoy!

When purchasing prescription medication off the street's these days you at constant risk of purchasing fake or imitation shit, claiming to be one medication but in return getting a pill filled with a bunch of fillers and food coloring leaving you on the verge of withdraw and begging for anything just to get well.  So that's why I am going to let you in on a little secret I know, that someone taught me wayyyy back in the day and has been saving my ass ever since.  Because it might not be your dealers intentions to sell you fake shit but you never know when your going to come up on the shit and whether they knew or not you don't want to be the one getting stuck with the shit at the end of the day.  So use these quick couple of steps to test your medications before buying them and hopefully you wont be fucked and posting pictures like the kid mentioned above hoping that you have real shit when you and I both know if hes posting on here asking.. Its most likely fake shit.. 

So lets begin..

How to test if the medication is bunk or not.. 

When purchasing the medication what you want to do is take the pill itself and tap it lightly on your tongue.  I'm not talking slobber all over it, just one simple light tap on the tongue should do and you should be able to tell in a matter of seconds.  Also if done correctly the person your buying them from will have no idea what you even just did nor care because it wont affect the medication what so ever and if you end up not wanting it just hand the shit back and say no its fake and there's nothing they can really do in the first place.  

So don't ask if you can tap it on your tongue just ask to see it and take a few out at random and tap them on your tongue.  If the medication is real when tapping it on your tongue you'll immediately be able to tell.  The pill will have a sour, lemony, prescriptiony pill taste, that can be immediately' noticed and hard to explain but if you a prescription pill of some kind next to you (which I'm sure most of you have ;) ) grab that thing and tap it on your tongue and you will soon see what I am talking about.  Its almost exactly like what a fresh bottle of oxy smells like the second you get them from the pharmacy and open it up for the first time and inhale that beautiful chemical smell into your lungs.  Its that but in taste..


Now if the medication is fake or bunk and the guy is trying to rip you off.  The will will almost have the complete opposite affect once tasting it.  Instead of being pungent and sour and lemony, electric.  It will instead be so bland, chalky, tasteless, and seriously feel like its almost repelling the moisture off of your mouth and will taste like absolutely nothing, except chalk.  



You'd be surprised about how many real looking fakes are out there.  So much so that one time I got sold 1,000 fake pills back in the day and they looked so real that I used to take 2 out of 5 pills and replace them with the fakes and bet people that if they could pick the two fakes out of the group that I would give them the 3 real ones that were in there and let them look at it and examine them in any way possible, yet unfortunately no one knew this technique and no one was ever able to detect the 2 fake ones out of the group, but if they'd of known this method it would of been as easy as 123 and I would of been out of three of my shit.l haha

However, this method hasn't stopped me from buying fake pills since I learned it because honestly most of the time we are getting ripped of the con artist whose doing the deal knows whats going on and will distract you enough to the point where your going to hand the money over before ever being able to get the chance to look at shit.  So you've got to be smart when doing these things, and just remember when its to good to be true, or when you have the feeling you about to get ripped off.. Most of the time you are and you should just get the fuck out no matter how hard that is at times, but just try your best to get out of the situation and definitely don't hand over any money.

Because think, you and I both know that if someone if going to have a problem with you looking at the shit before purchasing it, most of the time its not a good situation.  You don't need to see them all.. Just one will do the trick.  So give it your best shot and just remember this the next time you buying your medication!

I've had a habit for about four years, but this past year it has gotten out of control. I have spent $450-$600 on opiates every week, all year long. 7 months  ago my four year relationship ended. He kicked me out, abandoned me, and went to rehab. My parent's are extremely religious, and have made my life a living hell since they found out I didn't hold the same views as them. I have been emotionally abused by them to an extreme extent. If I smoked weed at their house they would kick me out. I have no support from anyone. So, with  no one to turn to, I started shooting five months ago. I have been hustling and doing all kinds of crazy things to support my habit. I do have a job, but I am beyond behind on all of my bills. I'm about to lose everything. Since I live with my parents, they are starting to catch on to my habits. I think they are going to connect the dots sooner rather than later. I've been taking fent pressed pills, so my tolerance is ridiculous. I have tried to go through withdrawal, but I always cave in the first 24-48 hours. I don't know what to do. I am horrified of the repercussions of telling my parents. I am afraid to quit. I don't know where to go for help. Methadone/subs? NA? Any advice would be welcome. Thanks ",1510716426.0

Search result -The noun recovery refers to the process of healing after an illness.

-----For me, kratom has definitely allowed me to heal.

Search result -Recovery is sometimes used as a synonym for ""being in remission""

-----For me, kratom has definitely helped my addiction to heroin to be in remission. And then in turn my mind and body.

PSYCHOLOGY TODAY: In most of life, ""being in recovery"" means a person is making progress even though she/he isn't ""cured."" -Lance Dodes M.D. Addiction Doctor

Someday Kratom may not be available for you to try, so if you ever wanted to try it for opiate addiction, the sooner the better.

And for those of you that tried it and did not feel anything you have to do it kind of like subs, you have to wait till you are in withdrawals to start, it is very light compared to the other stuff we take: ie-subs, methadone, heroin

Saved my life and want your life saved too. Whatever it takes..

I am an addict. I accept that fact. I am in extreme pain from a broken metatarsal fracture on the pinkie side. 

I asked for pain medication, as I am on suboxone trying to fix my life. The buprenorphine does not provide pain relief.   

I care about my life and I talked to my pain management/suboxone prescriber and he said it was alright to stop the suboxone to get pain medication to be effective for my broken foot. 

They refused any pain medication of narcotic nature. I was not looking for a high. I'm in extreme pain and needed help, and was refused. 

I am not angry. Just upset that I'm labeled as a drug seeking addict and refused help for my pain. 

Thank you for inquiring

7cytvq,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7cytvq/deal_with_the_devil/,21,https://redd.it/7cytvq,sloan_fitch,Deal with the devil..,"Last Sunday I was summoned while in light WD to fix a wifi problem for my friend's sister. They wanted to use a streaming web app and they had some trouble. So I installed a range extender (which I will be taking back after I run a long Ethernet cable to their bed room with a shittier AP) and configured official premium channel apps to work on her fire stick.

The cable TV web app that lets you get the channel line-up without a cable box was not working so well because the laptop was shitty. It was given to her out of my trash heap as a birthday present from her mom and siblings that I configured for her.

So I decided it would be easier to give her a more powerful laptop from the trash heap. Nonetheless, I spent time and I did some good work so she got me a sub. Later that week she's bugging me on a friday evening after a long day and I'm just like ""I need to wind down, I had a long day and I just found out that I need to wake up at 6AM tomorrow.""

That evening she bought it up a couple of times how she helped me out last week but she didn't bring up much detail. Two nights later after a twelve hour work day I bought her an HDMI cable. Although it was free, I indicated that it cost me money. She asked me to bring it for use with a blu-ray player. So when I handed it to her she asked me if I could come up to help her with it.

&nbsp;

Upon explaining to her how simple it would be to plug the HDMI cable into her blu-ray player she explains she wanted help with the cable TV web app which I had already told her I'd address the following day. 

I explain to her that I'm currently setting up a new laptop to give to her and she brings up the fact that she already helped me and I'm like ""I got you, and you already have the HBO apps on your fire stick, use that for now..""

She then bugs me more. Brings up how she helped me the week prior with Suboxone and I'm just trying to shut her up because I didn't tell her brother that I got a sub that day. 


&nbsp;

Why would I withhold this info from my friend? When I need him to get subs, he'll give me dope or pills and assure me that he'll get subs then often fail to get them. Last time I needed him to get subs he lied about being in contact with someone who had subs and never got subs when I needed. In times of the past, I've had WD from fent laced dope and had to suffer through work so it's important that I get subs when I ask for them and am willing to pay for them.

I've shared subs with my friend before but this time around I wanted to have something that he wasn't aware of so that I'd have it on deck when I would otherwise be in a bind. As a result, I now have a half a sub left when I otherwise would've been dope sick at work on a cold day.

&nbsp;

So now, when I deliver her laptop I still gotta be nice because she may be my only easy sub connect. I'll pay cash so she can't hold it over me. I'll also carefully explain to her how she's an asshole for saying that she helped me get a sub when I needed it in front of her brother when she knows damn well that I didn't share it with him while he was under the weather.

&nbsp;

For the work I've done I should get multiple free subs from her for fuck sake. She likely bought it up in front of her brother get me to hustle since she was putting me in a bad and awkward spot. I was forced to explain it away in some busllshit way which I managed to do effectively.

&nbsp;

Once I give her this workign replacment laptop tonight she better shut the fuck up. I'm also installing the same OS to a spare hard drive in case the hard drive currently in that laptop stops working. Why would it stop working? The other day when she pissed me off I dropped the laptop and side-kicked it in my frustration right after she left the room. So I expect the HDD to be unreliable and possibly to stop working. The plan is to be prepared to swap in a working replacement immediately after she calls me when it stops working. This'll allow me to expend the most minimal effort when that time comes.",1510693861.0

I think that this question is born of the type of thinking that keeps people away from treatment...i will explain:

If addiction is a medical issue (I don't believe it is a disease, but I do believe that the only real way to deal with opiate addiction is medically), then why is it so scandalous to bring ones children to the clinic?  We would never say it was inappropriate to bring a child to the urgent care with us if we have a sore throat.  The fact that we feel this way doesn't bode well for the future of treatment in this country.

Take it a step further:  how many people avoid the methadone clinic (which, along with suboxone/subutex, is the gold standard in opiate dependence treatment these days, much more effective than fancy rehab or 12 step programs) because it makes them look like ""a junkie""?  I suspect that is why so many people avoid treatment for so long...as long as your addiction is a secret, you never have to face it yourself.  This attitude will kill several people in the US today, and will kill hundreds this year.  

We need to drop all the stigmas.  Sure, there are people who are former or current criminals at the clinic, but would they be criminals if the drug war was ended?  If their drug was available to them in a clean, supervised place, and at a non-prohibition inflated price?  The vast majority would breathe a sigh of relief that they could now get this drug without fear of violence and poisoning at the hands of black marketeers, and then, most importantly, find legitimate work.  This is not theory.  It's what has happened in Portugal.  It's happened in Switzerland and the UK.  It's about to happen in Canada.  

It can happen here.  We just need to be vocal, and not waste any time or energy fighting each other, claiming that I ""may be in the methadone program, but I'm one of the GOOD ONES"".  Fuck that.  We deserve to have health and happiness like any other American.  ",1510683344.0

I figure there's no better person to ask than users themselves.

I recently started staying with a family friend to take care of him. This guy let a couple of people stay the night a few months back and they never left, they offered to pay him $100 a month per person for rent if he would let them crash on his floor. Since I've been here only one person has paid anything towards rent and it was only $30. He makes $700 on social security though he's not disabled, he's just a heavy amphet user and he's only 29 years old. Last month the disabled home owner called him on his shit and told him that he knew he was doing meth and that rent came before his drugs or he would be out on the 1st. The first came & went and he paid $30 in rent and the rest of his money went to pay a methamphetamine debt that he accrued during the month. These two individuals don't work, they constantly rob, lie, & steal. They scream and fight 24/7 and it's over the smallest most petty shit. I caught them in the shower getting busy and they were screaming & fighting while fucking each other, I don't understand it. I can't bring my son here out of fear that these people are going to bring down legal hell on this house. Another family member lives here and her young daughter sleeps in the same room that these people crash in and they're up all day & night screaming at each other in front of her and they're exposing her to things she should never be exposed to. We have all told them to get out by xXxX date and when that day comes they always have some shirty excuse about how they're waiting on their ride to get here or ""we're getting our apartment next week and we'll be out."" But next week never comes. I have helped pack their items and taken them to the porch, but they always play this mentally disabled individual and make him feel so bad that he stays up crying at night. I've confronted them about their use and actions but they refuse to listen. They both actively and regularly lie about their use (DAILY) and tell us that they're not using while they can't sit still, they're talking so goddamn fast that they choke themselves up, and it's beyond obvious that they're using. I put my foot down and told them this shit doesn't happen here anymore, if they're going to use they can do it elsewhere as they're endangering everyone in this house and opening them up to legal repercussions. The police are very aware of who they are as one is being investigated for robbing a restaurant on Halloween. I work 2 jobs and I have a son that I can't bring here because of their use & behavior. Every night we are all awoken by them screaming at each other in front of our rooms (or walking in our rooms) and turning the lights on and off like a goddamn light show. It's like experiencing night time & day time 100 times an hour. These people weasel their ways back in by playing the disabled home owner and he's so sick of them, along with everyone else, that it's affecting his physical health and has put him in the hospital for chest pains & anxiety. Calling the police to evict them is less than ideal as we have no idea what they've hidden or what they've done, they would no doubt try to pin their drugs/contraband on someone else. 

How do we go about getting them out when they're horribly manipulative and refuse to go willingly or with help.

TL;DR I need an Amphetamine users perspective on how to deal with 2 users who refuse to work, lie, steal, and bum off of everyone they meet. They scream & fight every minute that they're awake and it's affecting the household & the children. They're extremely toxic & refuse to leave or even try to help out. Calling the police is less than ideal in this situation.",1510680287.0

Sat in my front room, crushed up two and split them into lines with a mate of mine (who funnily enough was trying DMT for the first time). I remember being particularly careful as I was worried about overdosing and had been told it was common to spew the first time on opis. 

I still remember that first ever buzz coming on, it was nice and mellow and I just felt fucking fantastic, not a care in the world, watching this dude have his mind blown to pieces by the DMT. 

After that I walk him into town to get his bus and he looks like he's been skullfucked by a freight train.
