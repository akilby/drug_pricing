As pure luck would have it, I did an unwilling taper....my source ran dry when I was taking over 200mg of oxy a day. I managed to taper over a few days with norcos but by like day five I was feeling pretty good. For the first  time in months 3 days had passed with no oxy whatsoever.

Technically I was clean and didn't *need* anything.  It was wonderful. It really was. I spent the day **knowing** I would sleep tonight if I copped or not, and that I wouldn't wake up in WD. 

And of course I fucked it up and copped last night. I am getting a cold or something (prob as a result of the sudden clean time?) and didn't really feel the oxy like I wanted but it was fine...not great though, just fine.

Now here I am, I *feel* good. I still have some oxy glow in me from yesterday and I've taken the daily lope, but the jury is out on whether I just reset my tolerance and will be kicking tonight or if I'll be ok.

In any case, it's the addicts lot in life, making bad life choices.

I smoked through about .2 and started to nod watching peaky blinders. About 3 hours go by and I'm feeling thirsty so I get to the shop for a bottle of sparkling Whites pear and elderflower (the absolute bomb). 

I get back home and realize I can't find the foil I was smoking from or my tooter/pipe. I have searched high and low for a hour now and can't find the thing but I know it's in here somewere.

I'm in the early stages of making a prototype automatic naloxone IM injector. 

Basically it is a strap that goes around the upper arm or upper leg. When activated, a device on the strap beeps every 3 minutes which signals the wearer to push a button on it, otherwise it will alarm for a few seconds and then if no further action is taken it will push a 1 inch IM needle into the wearer's arm/leg and inject a small volume of IM naloxone. 

Some questions: 
 - Would you wear this while doing opiates?  
 - When you normally do opiates, do you get so incapacitated that you would be unable to respond to the beeping and push the button, although not be ""overdosed"" top the point where you would want rescue naloxone?
 - Is pushing a button every 3 minutes going to be too annoying/ruin your buzz?  
 - Would an inbuilt oxygen level monitor which triggers when you have low oxygen levels or very low resp rate be better? ",1485936271.0

Tried to use suboxone but had an extreme reaction to it. No it wasn't pwd, I waited 5 days before taking it the first time and it went real bad. Waiting 5 more days and tried again and it went worse. That wasn't an option for me. Only way to get methadone is at a clinic every day and I just don't have the time with my career. So taper it is. I know many try and fail but this is happening. 

I had an insanely huge fent habit. Went through a gram in a matter of days. Over the last 3 weeks I have successfully weened myself from the fent but I'm not out of the woods. I was down to 2 or 3 salt granuals sized doses twice a day. I'm finally ready to move to something less powerful. 

I have access to dilly p4s for $3 each so I snagged fifty. Being the poor nasal/rectal/oral bioavailability, I'm going to bang them. Never done this before with anything. I tried taking 2 and snorting on a different occasion but nothing. I shot 2mg and I have been good all night. That's why I'm going this route for about 10 days then dropping down to oxy orally and then off from there. 

My question is, what are some valuable links about rotating veins etc. My wife works in the health care industry and got me a couple hundred barrels and tips as wells tons of sterile water and alcohol wipes. She will be administering the doses. Have narcan on hand but don't think we'll need it. Regardless it's always the two of us, I'm never alone. She's on subs, they worked for her. I'm still participating in my treatment and my doc knows I'm tapering albeit don't think he was aware of this facet of my plan to bang them. 

It's a short term solution but I'd like to cause as little irreparable  harm as possible. I know by design this is a bad idea but I've made a plan and stuck to it so far. Getting off the fent was like being in a perpetual withdrawal given how fast I cut down but it obviously reduce my tolly considerably. 

When I was st the height I ran out of fent and took 150mg oxy and 16 dilly and didn't even feel Better. 

What I'm asking is for generally advice - biggest issue is filters. Don't know where I could get wheel filters.  Not even sure what they are he's for outside this purpose.

She's the one with the awful abscess she won't get treated. His mom and I have been going and hustling every day and she's always talking that good shit about how we should split the dope We get with our hustle money so if one of us has a bad day the other makes up for it. Ok sounds good with me I'm a team player. Well the last 4 or 5 days I've paid for at least 75% of the dope. Also I can't stop her dumbass from buying scratch off tickets. Well yesterday I finally had a bad day and was expecting her to cover it like I'd been doing for her. I only made $20 opposed to 100 like usual. She got dropped off at her friends house and says she 'll be back in 30 min with our shit. I've been dope sick the last couple hours and need relief. 5 hours later she comes in geeked the fuck up and gives me a half point and promises to have another half pt for me in the morn. It takes a minimum of a quarter gram to get me well. I'm pissed. On top of that she doesn't have the other half pt in the morning so I get a half a motherfuckin pt for 20 fml. She did it herself during the night so I don't even get a little placebo effect dose to get up with and I have a court date in the morning. It was absolute Hell.

                 After court I go to hustling sick and have a bad day at it. She's supposed to be out hustling as well but ended up not going. All I have the $ for is a half g and since I'm in a city I'm unfamiliar with I have to go through her person meaning I have to give her my $ to get it. She went into his house and comes out with a slack half g. Even says it's slack before giving it to me. Some people are so fucking stupid as she knew my overly generous ass was going to split what I got with her since that was the agreement in the beginning and I keep my word tho she doesn't. And we have to keep her son and my cuz well though they don't hustle or contribute at all!. I said fuck it and gave her a .075 and told her she shouldn't have bought a slack sack with my $$. She threw a fit but fuck her. I don't owe her shit. I'll go back to sleeping in the woods if I must. Least I'd be high.

                       I know I'm expecting too much and being way too generous but I'm a fairly nice guy and wanted to believe the best. Not the first time my kindness has been taken advantage of and won't be the last. She took a point out of the half g. The persons shit is always on point and she's always in and out of his place in 30 sec. This time it was 3 min. She was hoping she'd get away with pinching a pt then have me split the bag w her so she'd get .3 to my .2 even though I paid for 100%. Now she got like .17 instead of .25 and I told her that her sons shit had to come out of her stuff completely. I'm done playing this shit. Tomorrow on we 're going through my ppl even if it's an hour trip. Going to tell her I'm never going through her ppl ever again because she knowingly bought a slack sack.  Dumb greedy dirty bitch screwed herself and mistook kindness for weakness . also I'm not splitting shit with her ever again. I hope she learns from this. I'm just so sick of these mooches. 3 out of the 5 ppl who live here just sit around and don't hustle and now she's gotten lazy thinking I'll cover everyone's habits at my loss. Fuck that shit.


They also bum all my cigs! I get like 3 out of each pack. I do nice shit like buy food for the house and get none. Bought 3 Dr peppers for the house since everyone here including me likes it and I got 1 cup! 1 fucking cup!

I miss having a partner in crime I can split everything with equally. Gf being in prison is killing me. I fucking hate seeing ppl sick so bad but she was ok with me being sick so fuck it. I'll still help my cousin some bc she's blood but fuck the rest. From now on they either hustle or get sick. 

        Sorry for the rant guys.sometimes this is the only place I can go to unleash my fury instead of holding everything in where it'll fester as a mental illness. I know I'm being petty. Tom petty. And a baby about all this but it's pissed me off badly.

Quick question. I live in a major city in the NE. I take methadone off the street. Recently that source has dried up. I also can't continue to blow check after check on dope. That being said I've decided to go to a methadone clinic. I feel like it will give me stability in life. Won't have to worry everyday about getting sick.

To the questions;

1) Do clinics dose on the same day? I will be paying cash. I live in a major city in the NE. I am flat broke and don't get paid until Friday. My parents are willing to help me with my first visit & first week, but just curious if I can just show up tomorrow to a clinic and get dosed if all goes well....

2) My methadone tolerance is already up to like 60mg a day. I can take 30mg a day and get by ok, just won't feel any kind of buzz & might start to feel SLIGHTLY shitty by evening. Should I even tell the clinic I take methadone? What will a clinic do for me in this situation?

3) During my year of off and on methadone I have noticed one side effect I get is terrible sweating. I can never tell if that is from not using enough or using too much. ANyone else get this side effect from methadone? 

4) What happens if you fail a drug test? Is it dependent on the clinic policy or...?

I chose to scar instead of tattoo because I used to be a cutter (four years clean) and thought I'd make my scars beautiful. You know, and let it lie. My first one was the Valkyrie wing on my rib cage (yes, I stole the design from Max Payne), the second one on my side is a filigree design. 

Just thought I'd share something bizarre about myself and you guys might find it interesting.

Its the worst feeling in the world to loose someone you love. Im sure a lot of know and have felt it too. The person im talking about though isnt dead but im pretty sure ill never see her again. shes probably the love of my life, my soulmate,my fucking everything. I know its messed up to feel this way because she can never feel the same for me and shes married. Married to a great guy that can give her everything a house,a job,a kid, and anything. Im so fucking happy for her. all i want is to see her happy but its bittersweet cause its not me that makes her feel this way and shes moving half way across the country for his work. I would follow her to hell and back if i could but its just not practical.

I loved her way before I used and she doesn't know I use. Fuck her leaving kind of drove me here, not that its her fault and i would never blame her.

Successfully chipped till 2012 when I developed a steady oxy/heroin habit. Between that time I tried just about every opiod thats out there. Was given a script of Tapentadol after a surgery and had never heard of it and neither did anyone else I knew until a friend was prescribed it and since then have never heard even a whisper about it. 

From what I remember it was pretty good despite being relatively opiate naive at the time and got me rocked the first few times until I leveled out and could enjoy the calm euphoria that came with it. I'm curious as to how it would stand up to the level my addiction has progressed.

A guide.,"I also posted this in /r/drugs but this is also a good place to post it. Also see the edit about promethazine.

It definitely isn't easy but if you happen to live in a legal US state, yes, it is possible to buy codeine. In most of the world (canada and the EU) it's not too hard to buy tylenol 1 and aspirin with codeine in it. I always thought that it codeine in any form was de facto illegal in the US without a prescription.

To find out whether you live in a legal state you need to google the laws. [Here's an example for PA that I found after googling](http://www.health.pa.gov/facilities/Consumers/Health%20Facilities/Home%20Health%20Services%20and%20Hospices/DDC/Laws/Code_28.pdf). Page 25-27 gives an exception for limited codeine to be sold under the approval of a pharmacist. In other states like Washington the law bans codeine all together without a prescription. I believe that after some research it's pretty much only available around the east coast.

So what do you do if you live in a legal state? Well in all likelihood your state requires you to be over 18, have no felonies, and to not buy more than a few boxes per month. Let's say you do meet the requirements (not that hard) and you're set. Now you have to find a pharmacy that will dispense it to you.

The only OTC codeine brands that you can legally get are either Robitussin AC or Cheratussin AC. Both are a syrup with a mixture of codeine and guaifenesin. Guaifenesin, although not particularly dangerous in high doses even up to 10-20 thousand mg, makes most people puke (which is why it's added to so many cough syrups). It really depends on whether you're body can handle it.

Look up all the pharmacies in your area. Now make a list of them. Delete all the chains from it. No chain pharmacy like CVS or Walgreens is willing to sell codeine because of the potential backlash. Now you're left with a bunch of independent pharmacies that are generally one store. Most phone numbers for them should be easy enough to get.

Just call up each one of them and ask ""do you sell Cheratussin AC or Robitussin AC?"". Cheratussin is usually more commonly sold so remember to include it. If they ask for clarification ask about ""codeine with guaifensin"".

To be perfectly honest you probably shouldn't even waste your time. Most pharmacies will flat out tell you no or give the ""we don't stock that"" speech. But, occasionally there is one rare pharmacy that might be willing to sell it you. Stress the point that you've tried everything and this is your last resort.

Also if you can't find the good stuff, you can always just settle for DXM. It would actually be easier to get some vicodin from the 40 year old drug addict outside the local walmart. But getting legal codeine is a fantastic feeling so if you have the time why not.

EDIT: Promethazine is a different than codeine. Just happens to be that most syrups which contain Promethazine also contain codeine. I thought saying ""lean"" would sound stupid, but I thought some people might not be familiar with codeine itself. Sorry for misleading.

After that i cried to her about how much i've been using and can't take it. We had a long talk and finally decided that I should try sub maintence.

Pretty long read but I had to share,"So 2 days ago on Sunday morning I'm sleeping in with my girl, and she woke up before me. When I finally woke up, she was salty as hell for what seemed like no reason at all..

Little background: been together since may of 2016, and she knew I had a problem with pills when we got together but I ""cleaned my act up"" since we moved in together in September ( by cleaned my act up I really mean kept my shit on the down low, cuz u know, junkies gon' junk )

Anyways, as of the last two or three months I started shooting morphine, fent, Demerol, and buying 50mL vials of oral morphine drops (20mg per mL) and as u can imagine, was flying sky high the whole time but still managed to keep my usage under wraps. Now let me clarify, my girl only knew about my pill popping and my cocaine usage from years ago, I never ever mentioned shooting anything before. And since September the subject hasn't even come up bc she assumed I was clean the whole time...

Now back to Sunday morning: I woke up and noticed she was angry, and asked her what was up. To which she replied, 'cloudnine, have u ever shot drugs into ur veins?' like outta nowhere. My immediate assumption was that she saw the tracks on my arms while I was asleep. But no, I obviously denied having done that and she said ' are u sure? Tell me now nd don't lie to me '

Now, she proceeds to tell me about the dreams she'd been having all week. These dreams were about ME. And guess what she dreamt about me doing, yep. Shooting hard drugs. I was ready to dismiss her dreams as bullshit but she proceeded to explain her dreams to me. And I shit u not, she literally described to the tee exactly how and where I was shooting. 

Like she was describing events that I didn't tell anyone about, and describing them with incredible detail. For example, ""I dreamt that u were in the bathroom of ur job and u transferred something from one big needle to another smaller needle, then shot it into ur vein"" but like she described how I was sitting, what I was wearing, the difference in size of the rigs I was using, where I was stashing my rigs and amps, etc. This got to the point that I was jaw dropped open mouthed staring at her in disbelief, speechless. And by reacting that way I basically validated everything she was saying... She then checked my arms and saw the tracks which proved her accusations to be true.

Long story short, Ive come to the conclusion that I picked the one psychic chick in a city with over 20 million people. Believe it if u want, or don't. But that shit happened and I still can't fucking believe the incredible detail with which she described what I was doing. Had to share this with u guys because I just can't fucking believe it and I got nobody else to talk to about this kinda shit. Anyways sorry for the novel of text. Hope everyones having a great day and happy nods to all u guys out there from Argentina. 

TLDR: my gf is seemingly psychic and apparently can see me doing shit in her dreams that I never mentioned to anyone at all. She found out abt me shooting up via her own dreams. What the actual fuck is happening man",1485882542.0

Just need to share my story.,"Not quite sure what to say. Just need this shit out of my system I think. 

He (27yrs) was very sensitive and caring, in a way sorta naive also. We did recreational drugs together for years when clubbing, never did it occur to me that he would be doing opiates. His personality changed. He lied, cheated and abused me. He blamed me for his moodswings and such. He stole from me. We were in the verge of breaking up but then he died. Before his death he lost his job and moved back home with his parents... they couldn't figure it out either. I still miss him every day. 

Later I found out he'd been doing opiates (suboxone/heroin/what not) for years. Sometimes mixing the shit with benzos (which made him a raging bull). We were kinda LDR so I never understood what was going on. I thought he  might be depressed and blaimed my self for being a bad girlfriend. He got badly hooked after one of our breakups two years prior to his death. 

I hope some of you do get better. Most narcs I know are kind and loving, sorta fragile people sober. Hard to say the same for when they go through withdrawals or are high as a kite.

Little did I know that in July, 2016 it would reap my soul. I'm July I turned into a Heroin Husk and did things that I would NEVER do and for the next two months I would continue committing those heinous crimes, even after getting arrested for the crimes and then again a week later for possession of my Reaper and it's tools. Once released, 8 hours later, I left the state for my birth state. I continued following the same path for a few more weeks before I came back to my home state. Once home, homeless, I moved in with my old dealer and after four days of helping him get its our fixes I finally was able to peak through the veil and see the Demon I've become. Repelled at the sight of myself, I knew I had to leave. I left knowing I'd be homeless, but hell, I figured beyond homeless was better than being a mindless Zombie that feeds not on brain but in heroin. I once again started having control of the Reaper. And over the next four months him and I waged war against each other. He would win a battle then I would win the next. Once the fourth month ended, A new Year had begun, 2017. The final week of war was upon us and I was not going to Surrender my Frayed Soul to the Reaper again and that's when I was finally able to piece it's soul and completely break every hold it had on my, I've deleted every trigger I had for it, and I was relentless on my final attack as I decapitated the Urge to use a Heroin!

*tramadol 
*dihydrocodeine 
*codeine phosphate 
*oxy (probably not)

**apt benzo choice**

from diazepam to nitrazepam, Ambien to zopiclone, I can get.

which type of benzo do you find most useful for withdrawing, or maybe a non benzo **z class** like Ambien and zop?

Do you prefer the anxiety crushers, the knock outs, or the Inbetween like Xanax? 
Is it the anxiety that gets you or the lack of sleep, any advice on the best tranquilliser?
Of course I'd love a non benzo like gabapentin and/or clonidine, seroquel... I can only get the gabapentin. (Budget tho)

I was doing heroin daily for a decent chunk of last year. I went to treatment, got on suboxone, and as of a week and a half ago, got off of subs. Sub withdrawal sucks, so I figured my overall feeling shitty was because of that.

Then couple days ago I started pissing blood. I went to the walk in clinic and the doc made me go to the emergency department because they couldn't do shit for me. The walk in doc and the ER doc both inquired about my current meds and I had to explain the whole recently getting off bupe thing. After a CT scan, ER doc just gave me a fucking funnel with a screen to piss in and told me to try and catch it. With a referral for a urologist, I was out the door with no prescription.  

What the fuck? This shit already hurts. I'm pissing blood for fucks sake. Obviously I'm an addict, but why fucking risk a patient going back to heroin because you don't want to write a script for a legitimate reason? The whole reason I even started doing dope was because I have a fucked up back and my doc cut off my percocet and I couldn't find any pills where I'm at.  Will the urologist write me a script?

So I have been breaking my 2 milligram kolonopins in half and instead of two milligrams every 6 hours I have been taking one so that at night I can use them to get some rest. They don't work quite as well so I use a bit of Benadryl to help me stay asleep. But I have managed to stock pile a few half's doing so taking a little extra where needed. 

Well I went in today and pissed dirty for methadone which I haven't done in over a year since leaving the clinic for Suboxone treatment. He asked me what over the counter medications I had been taking I told him Benadryl due to allergies which was true but wasn't true as it had nothing to do with allergies I just didn't want him to know that I had ran out of my medication prematurely. Well he said good as that can throw the false positive but only in high doses. 

I take 150mg (three of the sleep aids) which I don't think is too much as even the box says take one or two pills nightly. Which two doesn't quite do the trick but three with a milligram of Klonopin keeps me asleep along with my medication for RLS. He refused to give me my scripts today pending the results from the lab. Which I told him I was not worried about because I had not been taking methadone.

Here is where my issue kicks in he said that was not my only worry that if it showed I was taking too much Benadryl he would cut me off entirely as people use it to make opiates more potent. So I am a little worried as I had been using 150mg nightly for the last week as I was sure I would get my scripts today which fell through. 

So now I have very few benzos and withdrawals from them is worse then opiates IMO. The test should take 72 hours as I paid extra for express shipping. I can get some bars if needed but I'm afraid of a surprise test, my contract with my doc allows for 4 surprise test I must take within 48 hours of getting notification and my job is aware of my rehab so they let me go right away and with it being a new year he has four times to give me the go ahead. 

I have been popped for taking bars as I have to take a 30 something panel test as it will tell which opiates or benzos I have been on and how much. It's about as advanced of a drug screening I have ever seen for urine. 

Now I'm prescribed two 8mg strips a day and just got them not long ago. I only take 1/4 a day as I share my script with my fiance as she has no insurance and is afraid someone will know of her addiction. Three days before my test I take my prescribed dosage as they test levels, which sucks as I feel withdrawn when going back to 1/4 for three to four days.

So anyhow I came here to ask I be worried? I know the sleep aid can build up a little over a week's of use but do you think the amount I am using will set off any alarms cutting me totally from my Suboxone, temazapam and kolonopin. And I overly paranoid? I can't sleep, work or function without my meds I'm utterly useless. So much so my kid notices when I am not on them. ",1485982697.0

First the pipe info: According to my grandmother (who was horrified when grandfather brought it home from Asia after WWII) it's 100-150 years old and was 'acquired' in southern China or northern Laos, though I have no way of knowing when and where it was made. Almost looks vaguely Japanese. 
I inherited this and would really like to use it, but can't find opium nowadays, unfortunately. The pipe is ivory and teak and fully functioning. This thing is well made, all original, and the ivory inlay is engraved with traditional southeast Asian scenes. It's rather hefty for a pipe and feels good in my hand. I've smoked hash from it several times, but I have a better, more efficient set up for smoking and so haven't used this pipe in years. 
 
I'm hoping you guys can help me decide what to do. I've read on here that a few of you smoke opium. I've also read that people smoke heroin. Since I haven't used heroin in decades, and only IVed it then, I don't know anything about smoking it except there's foil involved. Maybe it burns like opium and this would work, I have no clue. 

I suppose my questions would be: 
are there any other uses for this besides opium and hash? 
Can it be modified (without damaging it,) to use with heroin or meth or another substance? Is wood and ivory even OK as pipe material for new drugs? 

If the answer is no to modifications and other uses, do y'all think something old like this would interest people who use opium today? All I do regularly now is smoke weed in all its forms and I'll do crack or meth every once in a while. Not thinking this is good for any of those, but you wizards would know better than me if there was some way. Or maybe there's some new RC out there I could order that would go with this. 

If there's really no way to make practical use, I was thinking of selling it, but I'd want to be sure that there's no weird laws about it since it's paraphernalia and has been used (no residue or smell though) as well as being made with now-banned ivory, though I think I'm good on the ivory thing due to it's age. 

If y'all think it'd sell, I'd like to try sell it to someone who does smoke opium so it can live on and bring someone closer to the  drug dens of yore. Is there a forum for stuff like this that you guys use or would recommend? 

Any advice or ideas would be welcome. Again, I'm sorry this was long and I hope I didn't break any sub rules asking for your opinions and engineering ideas. Mods, please just tell me if I'm out of bounds and I'll delete this.

For you! I know it's different for most folk.,"Just curious here. Coke is so fiendy. It's always gone within 5 mins if a half bag (it's really bad). 

How long does an opiate high last of snorting or injecting or smoking; whatever it is you do before it's time to do MOAR?!?

And I am assuming that different opiates provide different lengths as well depending on how much and strong they are but that's how it is with most drugs.  

I don't do opiates. No desire to but I'm addicted to researching about different attitudes and experiences. Living vicariously is best for me! Struggling with Coke right now; just don't get opiates and so not know anyone that does them these days. ",1485976347.0

Some thoughts,"For 9 years was a light addict: I used to avoid sickness with a few decent efforts to quit (two that lasted for a few months). I held decent-paying but soul-draining jobs, graduated from college, and had a fun but unhealthy relationship that I stayed in because I was lonely and had nothing else. I was doing much better than many of the people suffering on here but still I feel like the honest answer to what I had was NOTHING.

Last year I quit my job, got clean, and started a new career track. I had NOTHING before and now I'm getting paid 75k/year to do something I actually enjoy, I am blowing none of that money on drugs, I am working out and doing other healthy shit every day, I have my own room in a shitty apartment, I can pay off the massive debt I accrued from living like an idiot, I have a girlfriend (it's not perfect, but it's very positive) and I feel I have some mastery over myself.

I would like to encourage everyone and offer some advice, but the truth is you already know the drill. You know there are thousands of people on here rooting for you to make it out this time instead of the next time you try. 

I will leave you with one quote that helped me, from Confucius. It's not advice but I feel it has something important to say.

I am clean as of 1/28. No opiates. No benzos. No alcohol. No weed. No kratom. 

Two weeks ago I tried to cut my wrists. I had IV'd crack and benzos and morphine and oxycodone. 
I had a needle and I was on a rampage to die. On 1/23, my best friend went to get some fentanyl. The same fentanyl that her husband had overdosed from snorting multiple times. She had just gotten out of detox. She said she wished she brought her Narcan. She said she we were going to die. 

I had a plan to to IV the fentanyl when I got home. I had taken benzos that day and had many benzos in my car. 

I started my car and we sat it in and snorted it. I woke up and my best friend's face was turning blue. She wouldn't respond. I didn't think she was breathing. I called 911 and they gave her Narcan and let her go. I was given a field sobriety test and arrested and charged with a DUI. In the back of the police car, I ate the fentanyl packet I had in my bra and the police saw me and took me to the hospital. In the hospital, I was let out on personal recognizance and I was pink slipped to the state psych ward. I detoxed there.

I have no car. I have no money. I have no license. I believe if I woke up a few minutes later my best friend of 22 years would be dead. I believe if I went home and IV'd the fentanyl I would be dead. I fucked up. My life was beautiful. I keep ruining my life with drugs. I'm scared. I hate addiction. I hope this is it. I hope these are the consequences I need to get clean and stay clean. 

For anyone struggling right now...I understand. I know how powerful addiction is. It's so painful, everything is painful. I hate myself sober and I hate myself on drugs. I knew something bad was going to happen, addiction quickly engulfed my life in a few days. I could only function for so long and pretend I was OK for so long. 

I'm clean and alive and I have a chance again.

So I've been on the lookout for a reliable H connect for awhile now. So a couple weeks ago I ask one of pill connects if she knows any one, she said she didn't but would look around for me. 
 So last week I get a call from her asking if I was still looking I told her I was, she proceeded to hand the phone over to this guy that was at her house, we will call him T. T says he can help me out, yada yada yada. We exchange numbers, the next day I get outta work, and call him up. I tell him I'm looking for 20$ worth and that I'll throw him 5$ for helping me out. Since this was the first time dealing with him I wanted to start with a low amount to feel him out. He tells me to meet at his house, but that he had to go a mile down the road to get it and that he would be right back, and that I could sit outside of his while he goes. I'm thinking okay whatever, my lady vouched for him, it'll be okay. Plus if he does rip me off at least it's not hundreds of dollars.

So this mother fucker has me wait for an hour and half out side chilling in my truck finger popping my asshole hoping this guy comes back. Did you guess that he didn't come back?? Ding, Ding you are correct. After several unanswered calls/texts I left. Called up my lady told her what happend. She apologized, and said it would be made right blah blah blah. A couple days go by and she tells me she finally talked to him, and the story is, T got ripped off earlier in the day for 400$ and he was using my 25$ to try and make it up. Hahahah whatever. T said whenever he caught the person who ripped him off, that he would make it right with me. 

Ya sure. I'm not holding my breath. I know it will probably never be made right, but that's okay. 25$ loss is a lot better than hundreds of dollars in my book. And karma is a bitch. I hope he gets his one day.

I've been addicted to various opiates on and off since I was 17 but I've always been pretty good at finding my way out after a month or two. The stuff hits my addiction centres like a freight train but after a while I always realise that I don't even enjoy the stuff, I'm just doing it and don't know why, and then I can stop. They all make me sick every time, no matter how long the habit's been going or what dose I'm at, and the actual high isn't as good as half the drugs I *could* be doing instead. 

Grabbed some H recently because it was a really good connection and I didn't want to pass up the opportunity. I mean, with the fent crisis being what it is, I didn't really know if I'd ever have the chance to try out real heroin without any fent in it in the future. Plus, there's no better price than 'free sample.'

...yeah, I'm going to have a problem here. I actually *like* this. No nausea and the high makes Oxy or Dilaudid look like a down's-addled third grader. 

If I thought I'd be able to get stuff this quality from the same guy again, I'd probably be extremely afraid for any chance of me having a future that involves anything other than nodding in a dimly lit room. 

I used to think that people overstated how good opiates are, even after watching them ruin my life more than once. Now...well, I found my drug of choice, and I'm going to be very happy when the bag runs dry. ",1486091267.0

So I was 18 or 19 working at a grocery store as a cashier. I was a huge stoner and I had access to opiates but mainly stuck to weed and psychedelics. 

Anyway there was this customer Ill call C. He was a good dude, married, a little kid who was around 2. He comes up to me and asks me if I can get him edibles. I say sure, and hook him up. After that transaction he asks me if I can get anything else. He implied painkillers. 

So I call up my connect who says he can get oxy 80s and thats pretty much it. I call up C and tell him whats up. I dont know if he was playing dumb or not but he asked me ""whats that?"" I thought that was kinda wierd. I tell him the 80s are painkillers used for terminally/chronically ill people, and that they usually go for around $25 each. 

He calls me and tells me he wants 200 of them! I was like uhhh dude are you sure. He says yeah. He gives me a wad of cash the next day at work and I go cop it from my boy.

I ended up getting them for $12 each!! So as a broke youngin I was amazed at the amount of money I made. It was like $2400 profit. 

C tells me hes sharing with his friends at work. I dont really give a fuck $$$$&

Not even a couple weeks later he asks for more. I obviously do it. Same deal. Happens multiple times: 120 80s , 200 40s . Basically anything I could get at the time. 

This continues on every couple weeks for a few months.

Then my homie ODs and dies. Fuck. I hear that the cops searched his phone to find who sold him shit. I proceed to get paranoid and tell C that im done selling pills and that I was scared of something bad happening. He goes nuts and proceeds to blow up my phone. I ignore it until he hits me up a few weeks later like ""man im sorry i was a monster,"" 

Anyway in the next couple months this guys wife leaves him. To this day Im not sure if it was the fault of the pills or what (probably a combo). 

(This was right at the time OP came out. I had no idea of the difference until I did some research. This is why I came up on the pills super cheap)

Overall Im glad I stopped even though I coulda made alot more money

(Shit post),"So I have been going through the same dope boy pretty much exclusively for two years. Even after being clean for five months, I sought him out before using heroin again. Hands down the best dope boy I have ever had. But there is one thing about him that I absolutely cannot stand.

That one thing is, his crazy obsession with backwoods. Now I understand that this is his go to choice when it comes to smoking a blunt. Swisher sweet tropical fusion was my go to back when I smoked daily, so I get it. The reason his backwood obsession pisses me off is because, literally everything reeks of backwoods. My dope boy wouldn't be himself without his damn back woods.

All three of his cars REEK of backwoods. If I get in any of his cars, my clothes will reek of backwoods until I wash them. When he pulls up next to me and rolls his window down to talk, and do the hand off. The stench of backwoods rolls out of his car. Fuck as I am laying here typing this, I can smell the stench of backwoods on my clothes.

And the worst thing, is that literally every single ticket he hands me reeks of back woods. Even if it is just a regular piece of paper, it reeks. My ROA is snorting (by some miracle I have not returned to IV since relapsing. *knocks on wood*) and roughly sixty five percent of the time, the drip from his dope has a very noticeable taste of back woods. Sometimes he uses parts of his backwood package to make a ticket, and when he does that, it tastes like straight up backwoods, every single damn time. Even if he makes a regular ticket, the dope still fucking tastes like backwoods most of the time!

I always enjoyed backwoods, but found that unless I planned to roll a large blunt, they were difficult to roll. So I always stuck with my go to wraps. But ever since I starting going through him two years ago, I have developed a strong hatred for backwoods. Fuck I am tired of tasting and smelling backwoods. 

PS: I said backwoods way to many fucking times in this post. Does anybody else have a strong hatred for something your dope boy does? That isn't the usual ""about to pull up"" problem. 
Also I hope all my fellow junkies got well today, and have a nice nod going on. Hope you guys have a enjoyable night! After waiting all day I got well about an hour ago.

I'm a 26F who started my journey with opiates when I was 15. I still remember taking my first pill and I loved it. I was a very angry teenager and I had a hard time controlling myself but pills always seemed to calm me down. I worked with a lot of people who had connections so if they worked shifts with me I got free pills because they didn't want me to lose my temper. I remember telling myself I'd never actually purchase pills only take ones I got for free but most of us know how that goes. I've done other drugs but I've stopped them with no problem. Opiates seem to be the perfect drug for me. I can function completely normal on them so no one ever knows and are shocked when they find out. I got married just over a year ago and within that time I had a miscarriage which really opened my eyes to the fact that I didn't want to be a mom on pills. This lead to me actually thinking about getting off pills for real. I decided to start seeing a counselor cause I wasn't really sure where to start. She told me I have anxiety issues and PTSD from the childhood sexual abuse I went through. She told me she wouldn't continue therapy unless I went to NA and saw an addiction doctor. I spoke to my husband and we decided that I wasn't gonna see that counselor anymore. His main reasoning being that she was not a Christian counselor. This lead me to start seeing a Christian counselor. It was going great but the more and more I had to think and talk about what had happened the more and more I craved pills. Having people tell me over and over to pray about it doesn't help. I stopped seeing her about 2 months ago but my husband thinks I still am. I guess you could say I'm stuck and I'm just reaching out to see if anyone understands my situation. I'm still on pills and after 10 years of on and off use I have a hard time even imagining my life without them. Idk if facing my childhood sexual abuse is actually gonna help or just push me to use more and more. ",1486081601.0

I posted here maybe in October, about how I was worried about my habit becoming an addiction. I wrote that I was blowing one to five tens a day or oxys if I could get them, and that I couldn't stop thinking about trying h. Even though my best friend was addicted for a year. Even though she constantly attends funerals for people she knows from AA. A lot of these people just do a bag or two after being clean and die. Most of them.
 Everyone here was really supportive. You guys told me I was lucky not to be physically addicted, that it's time to stop. Don't do heroin. Then I'll really have a problem.
 I started blowing pills a little less over those next few weeks but then I met a heroin dealer. He gave me two bags for free and his number. That was in October. 
 Heroin is funny. It tastes bad. It's gross. It makes me sick. It feels fucking amazing.
 Ive lost track of the number of times I've bought heroin. Maybe 15. One time I bought a hundred dollars worth and was on it for days in a row. I was sick the whole time. I thought, this is fucking gross I'm never doing it again. Then a couple weeks later, I bought some again. 
At the beginning of this month I bought six bags. I think it was more like five, he didn't have it bagged up so he gave it all to me together. And I did it all within maybe five hours. It felt better than it ever did. It was amazing. And I felt like I was going to die. And I (thought I) really realized that if I kept doing h I'm going to fucking die. I could have died that night. I mean I don't have a huge tolerance, I'm a 110 pound girl. 
Tonight is the second time I've bought it since. The only reason I never got physically addicted is because I fucking love Adderall and I'd rather be on that. 
 I don't know what kind of response I'm looking for. I just want to talk I guess, noone has any idea I've been doing dope.

He didn't die on 2/2, but this was the day in 2016 his parents publicly acknowledged he was missing and asked for help locating him.  I spoke to his Mom the morning of 2/2/16, hearing what she knew and comforting her as best I could.  She was so stuck in the recovery mindset I felt bad.

I'd met Corey somewhere else but we'd stayed in touch after we moved to different parts of the country--we had similar views on the world and on life.  I could message him out of the blue and we'd continue the conversation as if we'd just talked the day before, even if it had been months.  I'd just spoken to him in January, just 10 or 14 days before his death.  He had moved closer to me after a long binge (a friend of his had OD'd mid-2015 and he'd let things get out of a hand a bit).  His parents had sent him to rehab and I was glad he was closer, I really wanted to see him, help him see some light in the situation.

Im 22 m, a few months ago I started experimenting with morphine. The first time I tried it I plugged 20mg with no opiate tolerance at all and didnt feel a thing. 2h later I plugged another 20mg, still very little to no effects. 

I waited for about 2 weeks, tried plugging 60mg and I felt something for 2 hours, after that I was basically sober again only with problems peeing and really good sleep. 

Again I make a break for a reasonable amount of time, then I plugged 100mg. I was high, finally. Not overwhelmingly, just a mellow nice high for about 6h. Since then this has been my usual dose, occasionally with 150mg doses in between when I want to get really fucked. 

I always do 2 weeks breaks between my uses, how is it possible that I need so much? Normal people would puke their guts out with half, or am I mistaken? Anybody else has this freakishly high tolerance where there shouldnt be a tolerance?

I use either substitol 200mg or compensan 200mg/300mg, an experienced ex junky friend of mine showed me how to cook it, so Im sure Im not doin anything wrong in that department.

Let me start by saying, I love opiates. Love em. And I'm pretty sure they love me too. I'm not here to tell anyone to change anything about themselves or their drug use, do you. Life can be brutal and terrible, and opiates can help with that. That said, I've decided to stop. 

My habit isn't what it once was, I started on Perk 30s and moved to dope as perks became more expensive and my tolerance became higher. At my peak, I did about a bun/bun and a half a day for a year. Nowadays, I enjoy a half a bun or so every 3-4 days. I found, for a while, this to be the sweet spot. I did just enough to get high, you know reward myself after a long week that sort of thing, without dealing with heavy withdrawal symptoms; like vomiting. And the wait made it almost that much better. My issue isn't that it interferes with my life or anything like that, it's just the fulfillment I get isn't what it used to be, and so it just doesn't seem worth it anymore. The high isn't that euphoric feeling, that feeling that you are God himself, anymore. I miss it, it's like I've lost a good friend. 

So at this point, my only options are to up my dosage or quit altogether. And as much as I love opiates, going back to my once a day habit isn't an option. I was happiest with opiates when I was using in the manner I just describe, and now that it's not doing it for me anymore, there's no reason to continue. 

Most people will tell you opiates will eventually destroy you, destroy your body, mind and life. And I certainly have moments I regret, but the good outweighs the bad really and I'm sad to have to go. 

So, I just did my last bun. Let the long goodbye that is withdrawal begin...

Does anybody have experience with drug testing for suboxone maintenance treatment? How do they distinguish between a positive for buprenorphine and a positive for some other opioid? Do they do bloodwork at all and make sure that you have been taking it as prescribed and that the levels of bupe in your blood match your prescription? Does it increase your tolerance drastically being on suboxone?

Well, a long time ago (like 4-5 years) I made a post here on this sub like the many we read weekly ""Hey Guys Love Opiates Plz Check my Chipping Strategy!!1!!1!!!1!1!"" - under another handle, just made this alt.








And as many I thought I was invicible and for sure could Indulge in using opis weekly without getting addicted (I have total control of life, this is never gonna get me!) But that feeling was too good to be experienced only once a week.









I've read someone describe an opiate rush as ""just imagine you are laying in the softest of clouds and god is massaging your back"" with that delicious warm fuzzy feeling inside. It was only logical, why would I make me go through a day without feeling that? It's way too good.









I had a fairly generous allowance from my dad that allowed me to keep using them (Oxy is my DOC) without raising any suspicion at all. As you all know that didn't last for long. Soon enough the money that was supposed to last me a month would only be enough for 15 days, I would eat less, go out less because who cares, popping pills is way better than that.










I started maxing out on the credit cards and soon enough I got caught, threatened with Rehab on an almost daily basis but I just told them that I was strong and could stop using ""piece of cake"". Only to figure out another way to raise money and get caught in a couple weeks. Rinse and repeat that was my life for almost a year.









Then things got tense and I was force to rehab (worst experience of my life, by far, even thinking about it years later makes me nauseous).  Needless to say not a week later I was back to using.










Things kept repeating and I feel like everyday of my life I am digging a bigger grave for myself, but to stop using? No way, those pills are to good for me not to indulge myself in them.








TL;DR: If you are considering chipping PLEASE just stop while you are ahead, nothing good wilm come out of it.

Throwaway since id rather not have this linked back to my personal life. Ive been addicted to opiates of some form for about the past 7-8 months now. Started out how popping the occasional perk to relax when friends had them. We all know how easy it is to go overboard. That turned into sniffing around 100mg a day oxy habbit. Dabbled in some boy for a while after the oxy got to pricey and i lost my job. Recently though my DOC has been opana. Was getting a decent deal with them and have been on those for the past month. Started out only needing 5mg to catch a nice nod. But after like 3 weeks I was sniffing 20mgs at a time to feel decent and catch the slightest nod. Now it seems the supply has dried up for now, and since i still havent found a decent job and have barely enough money to get by without my addiction. I figured itd be a good time to stop. So tuesday morning i took the last 5mg i had left and figured id finally try to get out of this hell ive put myself through. I know compared to some of the people on here I'm probably not doing. Crazy amounts, but i knew i would be in for a rough time with withdrawls. I was doing pretty good for the first 2-3 days. Using lope, xanax, kratom and some bud to mellow out the symptoms. And beside for the occasional wave of extreme depression i was feeling decent. And then a friend ended up having some roxy 5mgs last night. Idk whst compelled me to do it but i bought 2 of them and ended up sniffing them. And to be completely honest, i didnt even enjoy it. I knew it wouldnt even get me any kind of buzz, but maybe offer some relief. But all its done is just make the depression ive been feeling 10x worse. I was roughly 80hrs clean when this happened. The longest ive gone since my addiction started.  And i cant stop kicking myself for it. I feel as though im back at square one again. Im unsure if this is gunna kick the WDs back in. I was just starting to feel a bit better as well. I guess ill find out in a bit once the drugs leave my system. I dont really know why im posting this. I guess i just need to let it out a bit. I dont have the greatest support network to help me through this. Well. Sorry for the wall of text.

The answer is yes, about a week or two later (yesterday), I took only 20mg of Oxycodone and it was working more effective than the 30mg of Oxy I would take at a time. Not a placebo because I felt the radiating warmth that I usually get from the opiate.

So yes, under-dosing did drop my tolerance so a great extent and helped in the sense of going throughout my days compared to going without an opiate. 

PS: I also normally combine a small dosage of a benzo such as Ativan (1mg) or Valium (10mg), and when I took the Oxycodone without the benzo I felt the effect I listed above. 

Disclaimer: this worked for me, it may work for you guys, despite what any science says (if there are even studies out there for this tolerance drop regarding the euphoria produced by opiates), so give it a try, I have faith it'll work for you guys having trouble, like I did, going throughout my days opiate free.

I've taken the advice that many of you kind souls gave me and have taken a step back in order to preserve my sanity and my marriage. I still call and ask them how they're doing and visit once in a while. 

I've been seriously thinking of getting some narcan. I say this because the last time I was visiting my mom she was chewing her fent patch and I didn't want to start a fight by pointing it out. She'd been wanting to go to the ER for a cold or something that wasn't going away. I offered to take her but she said no and I visited later on that day. She said she hadn't been but she was still wearing the hospital bracelet. I was like whatever don't want to start a fight so we started watching TV. She was seriously passing out and I didn't notice it at first but when I did I realized she wasn't breathing normally, I'd say her respiration per minute were at like 8-10. I freaked out and shook her and she woke up. I was like ""Let's have some coffee!"" and went out and told my stepdad what I knew was happening and that if he didn't do something she'd probably not wake up. 

Since he's a nurse and an addict I'm pretty sure he had some narcan and that's what he went to give her because after a while she was really upset but alert. I've come to the realization that I need to get some narcan to keep with me just in case that ever happens and he's not around or worse-- just doesn't care. 

I've read a bit on this subreddit about narcan and the prices can be crazy. I'm going to do some more research as to where I could find it in my state and the pricing. Other than the scary overdose potential my mom has things have been going okay, I mean, I'm really trying to let go a bit for my sanity and to not create any friction when I know they won't quit/get clean until they are ready.

Not sure if anyone would care for the update I just thought I'd through this out there for anyone that read the last post.

We actually both still felt like shit and sick, just a little bit better. By that time out normal guy gets back to town so bf goes to get us some more.

  my boyfriend used opiates and dope casually and extremely safely the entire time i've known him. he would always do his research and would only shoot up one night every 2-5 months, never used alone, and always had narcan. i've never used heroin, but he really seemed to take every precaution to stay somewhat safe while shooting up. 

  three weeks ago, his long time friend (4+ years of knowing him) came by and convinced him to use again. he had narcan and a ""trusted"" friend who is very familiar with heroin and what to do during an overdose. unfortunately, my boyfriend did end up overdosing that night. instead of narcanning him or calling 911 and bailing, his buddy chose to rob him and left him to die and for me to find his body after i got home from work. 

  he was young, talented, smart, caring, and a fucking god damn amazing person. he had stopped using a few months before and helped many of his friends get clean with him too. he just really never thought he would actually die from using, and everyone that knew him and his habits was completely shocked. if you use, even in the safest way possible, it can happen to YOU. it can destroy YOUR family. YOUR loved one could find YOUR corpse. if you do wanna use, it's safer if you have the resources to use with multiple people as opposed to putting your life in just one persons hands. please, i encourage you all to ask yourself ""do i really trust this person with my life?"" next time you use alone with just one other person. thanks for taking the time to read this. best of luck to you all ‚ù§Ô∏è

But Very Glad It Did!,"So this evening once I was off work, I was looking to pick up, I had 57 dollars cash from tips on the day. I quickly find out my go to guy is out of town, most likely to re-up, so that puts him out of the picture for this weekend. The other 2 options are as follows.

Option A: Always available, always answers his phone, always has you come to his apartment, always has OK but not awesome quality, but most importantly, **ALWAYS** shorts it. Always. That being said, I don't go to this guy under any circumstances, outside of, well, a lack of *any* other options.

Option B: Hit or miss availability, never answers a phone call, like ever, will text you back, sometimes quickly sometimes not. Usually has you meet him at a gas station or liquor store parking lot, you know the drill. His quality is always on point, top tier stuff. The catch is.. he won't bother to serve you if you don't have 125 or better. Being as I have 57 dollars, I'm not even going to waste my breath calling or keystrokes typing a message to him. 

So do I fuck myself over, going to Devontray and letting him fucking short me AGAIN, or do I try my hand at pooling funds with someone to hit up Squirt? Let's give the latter a go. I start to call, text, FB, and snap chat message the usual suspects, those of us who will throw in with each other on occasion and get down together. Welp, getting off at 6 means that like the too tall, overweight lesbian girl at a middle school mixer, I'm left alone to sulk as everyone else has already paired off. Akin to the kind gym teacher that dances and twirls the poor girl around in attempts to make her feel included, I do have a buddy that says he has 20 bucks towards the cause; which is thoughtful, but still has us falling well short of the 125 mark.

In a line of thinking and decision making that exemplifies the addict mentality (and disregard for the welfare of my not too distant future self) I possess, I decide that I'll be going to the casino on my way home (there's a sizeable casino and horse track less than 2 miles from my house.) in an attempt to more than double my money so I can slide into Squirts DM's.

I decide to do 10 dollar hands of blackjack, betting mostly 10 or 20 bucks a hand. I'm able to build a decent stack to about 70 or 80 after starting off cold losing my first 2 hands. And then there's break time, and a new dealer takes over. He keeps me afloat for a bit, but my chips start to dwindle as he hits 20 or 21 4 out 5 hands, and I'm down to 4 5 dollar chips; two measly hands left.

 I step back from the action for a round, and after the hand I'm not involved in finishes, the male dealer is relieved by an Asian gal, who promptly begins to deal me sweet, sweet victory. I bet 10 of the 20, win, and stack that 10 I just earned onto the original bet of 10. I'm betting 20 bucks a hand, winning, bringing in the 20 I made and keeping the the original 20 out there. 

I do this a couple times with a fair idea of where I'm at, and a quick count reveals I'm sitting at 110 bucks, fucking right! I can do one more hand and not effect my acquisition funds, so I do it, and the dealer flips blackjack. Alright, take your hint, get off the table while you still have the 20 5 dollar chippers you need.

I cash my chips out and am elated and honestly surprised it actually worked out for me! I get to my car in the lot, and I try to get a hold of Blanch. Weelll.. you see.. Blanch had a buddy of his own who (free of charge) shared with Blanch the stuff Squirt has, and what do you know, true to form, it's fuckin good. Good enough that it's 7:45 on Friday evening and Blanch is assed the fuck out.

SHIT!! So now what? 107 isn't enough, and I couldn't squeeze a dollar out of anyone else earlier, it isn't happening now. Sooooooo, I march back into the casino, confident, but agitated that I'm back to these circumstances. Returning to a 10 dollar minimum table, I join and place 20 bucks out there. The dealer (different than either of the previous 3) throws me a 10 and king, gorgeous. I wave him off. 

Some Indian dude made an astoundingly bad hit, which didn't effect anyone that game as he was the last before the dealer, but man I was surprised. Between the sometimes extreme frugality of most Indian men, as well as their inclination towards numbers, math, software, coding, I just assumed that he'd be a little better with determining his odds.

Anywho, the dealer flips a 10 and 4, sexy. He flips his hit card and just as hoped, she was a queen, he busts and I get my 20 bucks. I cheer quite loudly at this, quickly snatched my winnings off the table (which confused the shit out of the other players at the table, a guy hooting and hollering about winning 20 bucks and walking off after playing a single hand lol) and boot scoot and boogey to the payout window. Receiving my final 20, I'm now in position to get a hold of Squirt, and reward myself for the mixture of skill, luck,  stupidity, tenacity, and whatever other Fort Minor lyrics there are.

I picked up maybe 20 minutes ago, and this was one of the more satisfying copping experiences I've had as of recently.

For those who made it this far, thanks for reading y'all, happy nods!",1486183781.0

 Of course smoking less weed, and more black will make my tolerance to weed go down. It's almost as if the weed high feels a little different now that I've been smoking BT. It kinda feels like a light went off in my head, that is telling the pothead side of me that weed really isn't as good as I though it was for the last 7 years.

 I always enjoyed the weed high, but now the negative effects of weed in general are more...pronounced to me When I say negative effects, I mean the little things. How on-edge it can you you, the paranoia, lack of motivation, laziness/fatigue. Honestly these don't bother me because I still somewhat enjoy the weed high. But some how heroin helped me cut back in weed...I know you can laugh a little at that now if you need to...but hey I've never been able to stop smoking weed like this. I still smoke every day, or every other day but only a few hits unlike grams on grams daily like before. Now I just have a heroin problem. CX",1486179899.0

The program told me to get a higher power, I picked Jesus. I started seeking this new found ""God"" to help me, being beaten an broken, all the while praying, asking if he's even God an does he even hear me? I didn't grow up in church and surely ain't ever been into it so if this Jesus is truly real I have to experience something outside of myself if this is ever gonna work... A month or so of daily seeking I had a vision. Bright golden words appearing in my mind like a theatrical movie playing against the darkness of my mind, glowing bright whitish gold as they first appeared then fading to a gold as the next ones came after the first . Oh how I knew at that point that this was the sign I prayed about!! (""Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the EVIDENCE of things not seen"" Hebrews 11:1)Oh and life just gets better after this... Not. Lol. Why? Because I had the faith and didn't do anything with it.. ""Faith without works is dead"" I end up getting locked up 3 more times after this, start shooting meth instead of dope. My last run I was MADE to go to rehab or get kicked out of my mom's house with no place to go, but I really did want to get clean. I wanted to get clean 3 years ago!! Ha I used get tweaked out an start talking about how much I wanted recovery and a stable life an burnt everyone out.. An how I knew that God was truly real and how I was blatantly going against him as I continued to stick a needle in my arm. So this brings me to may of last year, get out of rehab, Go to a recovery house in a completely new city, York PA, just a county over from where I used to live. So I got away from people places and things. Was made to do 90 meetings in 90 days but cheated my way through it.. People in the meetings be like, you got a home group, you need to go to a meeting everyday? How are you still sober? What I was doing different then all the people in the 80+ other recovery houses was actually taking the program out of the meetings, and working on a real relationship with God. Today I am going on 10 months clean (longest time ever) moved out the recovery house and most importantly I have a peace that surpasses understanding as the Bible talks about, therefore the irritable and discontent feeling of not being high is gone. I'm actually happy, there's a smile that comes not from myself. Is life perfect? No. But now when I'm dealing with a life situation I can put it in God's hands and literally feel the spirit come over me and wash it all away,instead of a drug that makes it worse. Thoughts of drugs come in but today I have the power to not act upon those thoughts, which I never had before. It was always a battle for my mind and I let the devil take hold. So many people may think it's a placebo effect, but then I must tell you that I used to try to listen to those music wave things that supposedly get you high and never ever did it work. Crazy stuff happens when you put your faith in the true living God, Jesus Christ!! 10 months may not sound long, but for a horrible lying theiving junkie like me, who couldn't last a week without atleast smoking weed or drinking once I was already clean for a while from being locked up (which alcohol and weed did lead me back into heroin and meth eventually) or resist the next urge after I just did that one and know I shouldn't do the next, but do anyways cuz now I already started and can't stop. it's truly a miracle.  You can have what I have. Wash away your prejudices, and believe in the name of Jesus,to be saved on this earth and the heavenly realms!! ",1486178930.0

LOVE THIS KID!,"Shitpost about how awesome my dealer is. After years of dealing with absolute assholes that would make me wait in parking lots for hours when I was spending $500 I finally found a guy that gives a fuck. This kid is by far THE BEST dealer i've ever dealt with.

- Has pretty fire dope for $100 a g
- Shits weighs out so well everyone always thinks they got more than what they payed for. personally I think the kid probably weighs out the proper amount and people are just used to getting ripped off.
- Delivers out to my house 30 mins outside the ghetto
- Will deliver FRONTS out to my house 30 mins away from him
- Gave me 4 grams for an Ipad that would have netted me $100~ from the pawn shop
- Isn't a fuckin' douchebag. Doesn't drive a super fancy car or talk to you like you're scum. I never really cared much about this until one of my other dealers shot a nine year old... I don't want my money going to people like that.


- And here's the doosey. Right now I'm 3 hours north of our city. We're from Mid-Michigan and right now I'm basically in the fuckin' upper peninsula. I texted him earlier today asking if he'd drive up for $700... no response. I figured he might be locked up because he always responds. Turns out I texted the wrong number! I texted the question to the right number and within a minute I got the ""wya"" text.

I LOVE THIS KID! I almost flipped a chick with him the other week... but decided against mixing business with pleasure. Also I'd never want to flip a chick with a black dude cos it'd make my dick seem ever smaller.

He said he's leaving now. It's 7:30 and it's a 3 hour drive. I'm gonna figure it'll be LATE by the time he gets here though.

I am tipping him $200 for the drive though. For $700 (including tip) I'm getting 3 grams of fire an an OZ of loud, not bad even if it was $700 flat!",1486168161.0

I get dealers want to batch some of their product with fent so when people hear of an OD they go to the stuff thinking it's strong and the normal stuff isn't cut. Why not just sell it separately?

This time.... HEROIN AND CRACK! Question for all you speedballers,"JEEEEESUS CHRIST. I have to work in a few hours and couldn't sleep.  Did a fat shot of dope which was my landing gear and that didn't really work out.  I mean I know another would knock me out but then I wouldn't have dope for happy nods later.  I feel like if I was a drug novice this would be a ""HELP I THINK I DID TOO MUCH SPEED"" post but I'm pretty calm in the mind and I'm gonna ride this out a bit.  Other than the intensity (just banged it like 10 mins ago) not fucking bad at all.

I've been posting a lot about my crack/coke and uppers experiences lately.  I have such a low tolerance that a few days earlier I was broke and payday wasn't around so I thought i'd just do uppers to make me feel better and it basically worked (plus had subs).  Now I'm at payday and got a nice sack of heroin and will be saying goodbye to the insane world of uppers for awhile.  Glad I got to check off my speed ball bucket lists though.  It's kind of like the Bowser level of doing drugs and I passed.  

I do have to ask the people who do this as their regular habit....how can you do this all the time?!?  It just wears me out so quick....My tweaker/speedball buddies always tell me about their staying up so long amounts of time and going and going like the energizer bunny and here I am unable to keep up like bitch ass Duracell (battery humor!).  There must be some tricks of the trade so that's my question.  How do you brave souls do it?

Well, back to the magical world of the downers...that is after I get done with all this crack.  Later yall.  Happy nods!

Anyone ever experienced this?,"I just recently bought some oxy 30s from a new guy. I've been taking oxy for several years now but something doesn't seem right about these. 

They look real, break in half easily but not too easily(I've heard fakes either fall apart or are hard  as a rock) they dissolve in water the way oxy typically does and they taste like bitter oxy. They also don't burn when snorted and have that bitter drip. They are light blue all the way though and the imprints look good. Everything seems legit except for the buzz. 

They take longer to hit me and don't give me the happy euphoric feeling I typically get with Oxys. The buzz is kind of a spacey feeling like I don't want to do anything mixed with a speedy feeling like I can't sit still. I've never been this uncomfortable taking opiates before. They do take away my withdrawal symptoms so there has to be some type of opiate in there but they just don't feel right. I usually love the feeling and have cravings to keep taking more but I don't have those feelings of wanting to take more of these ones.

Where I'm at, like a lot of places I'm sure, there is a problem with fent / other synthetic garbage being more prevalent than dope.  I vastly prefer real dope, but sometimes it just doesn't happen.  So anyway - a couple of weeks ago, I took a bit too much of one of these synthetics.  I passed out for a while, and slowly came to wheezing horribly bad.  As I came to the wheezing improved, but I felt like I had a bit of a chest cold for a couple of days after that.


Something similar happened last Monday, My usual dude doesn't fuck with fent, but for some reason that day he was, and that's all that he had.  Like a dipshit, I did too many of those and blacked out for pretty much a full day.  Pretty fucking terrifying looking back at it.  When I start remembering things again, I remember major wheezing, and coughing up nasty shit.  Again, chest didn't feel right for several days, and wasn't quite 100% yet yesterday (but close).


Now last night I got some real dope (not fent), did a fair amount - though not a ton with my tolerance - and then eventually went to bed.  Now, I didn't pass out, fall out, get sick, or feel in any way like I took too much. In fact I kinda wanted to take more, but real H tends to interfere badly with my sleep, so I didn't.  Again last night, I found myself waking repeatedly (which is normal for me on H), but wheezing just ridiculously at various times through the night, and I've got a kind of deep - although so far unproductive - cough.  Maybe a small touch of shortness of breath too, although I suspect that's more tied to anxiety.

I stupidly took another shot this morning when I woke up, which hasn't improved things, although hasn't really made things very noticeably worse either.  I thought about it and decided that I needed to take a break for my own health and flushed what I had left, and got rid of my kit and everything.

I'm hoping that this clears up on its own here in the next few days, or I suppose that I'm going to need to go hit up the Urgent Care.  Anybody else run into similar symptoms / have any idea what might be going on?

So recently moved to the great PNW in search of some scenery.

""awh, fuck that bullshit man that'll kill you, just get some coke or something."" I'm sure you know the type...

ANYWHO the Godsend that just randomly walked up to me got pinched apparently and the other dudes MIA for months. Which the later doesn't matter to me, one of those middle men who you have to hangout with and hear about their shitty marriage for an hour trying to cop. Just to get pinched cause ""his dude pinched him"" 


So I used to live in DFW. Texas sucks but dope was the easiest thing to get, literally just pull up to a gas station in ""Southside"" anywhere and 30 black dudes pop out of the bushes and sewer drains ""Aye boi watchu need!"" 

This area is different. So there's literally NOT a hood here. There's maybe like 3 black people in this entire state lmao. 

So my usual day consists of me parked outside the most run down gas station I can find, looking for people who fit the profile. & Either not finding any or being too much of a pussy to ask. 
I've never missed the hood so much in my life. 

So idk man, just some advice on how to cop specifically in the Oregon/Washington area (if that's too specific let me know and I can re word it) 
Or some pep talk or something...

Idk why I'm so hesitant to just ask people around gas stations and shit. I've read so many positive copping stories you think it'd have me pumped to find the dope man around my area.

I snort relatively slowly so it doesn't go immediately down my throat/lungs but the second pill, I snorted in my right nostril but *just* before inhaling, I decided to give it hell and snort the **fuck** out of it and see if there was a difference.

Usually when I snort oxy, I feel *something* within 5 mins but still takes around 15 mins or so to feel full-on high.

Additionally, I cop about 30 mins away from home so when I'm at point X on the road I take, I'm usually pretty good and high. Well today, after shotgunning that shit up my nose on the right, I was *fucked up* and had a major euphoric rush **way** sooner than I should have. Within that first 5-7 mins I was fucking *super* high. I almost worried that it was fake (it wasn't).

My theory is that alot went into my lungs causing me to immediately feel it.

Question - what is smoking pills like? Is it an immediate high with a fast onset rush like this? Does it wear off fast when you smoke them?

Within 10 mins of the super rush, I was back to normal...still high as usual. It just hit me virtually immediately and very strongly.

Ive read conflicting reports from at least 30 mg needed to be satisfied to 5 mg getting a non tolerant person blown. Ive also barely taken hydro (same price as hydro but less potent, wonder if its worth trying some more since some people find it more euphoric) so i wonder if 10 mg of hydro would even do anything at all lol.

I've never used any type of opiate for any reason. Couple of benzo's just to get high but thats about it. 

I've had an accident last year that left me with chronic pain in my ankle and ever since it's so painful it's practically debilitating when playing sports, something i love to do and a huge part of my life. The pain is ignorable when just walking and going about my daily life but whenever putting any pressure on it in slightly awkward positions it puts me on the ground the pain is so bad. 

I obviously went to a doctor and took an mri but to no avail there was no clear cut procedure or even diagnosis for my pain.

Right now I'm heavily considering pain medication but i don't know if it can be applicable to my situation. 

My main questions are:

Are there pills that can provide pain relief for a few hours of play time that wont cause me to become too drowsy?

Will my tolerance climb if it is only taken once about three-five times a week?

This is the story of my romance with opioids - from discovering them to almost dying. All in a month... yes, I was very very ignorant towards opioids.

Yes, there is a tl;dr at the bottom, heh.


Since this is my first real post, let me indroduce myself with a few words. I am 18 years young and already had ""some"" experience with drugs before I found opioids. Oh, I am also depressed, and trying to use drugs to escape reality. Basically, I was smoking weed daily, taking LSD as often as possible and did ketamine regulary. Stimulants every third day, or something like that. Nothing too special, just your normal kid.


While browsing a darknet market, I stumped across the opiod category, clicked it and saw that the ""common"" opioids are kind of out of my budget. Also, I wasn't really interested because... Well, I had my stash and was happy. I scrolled through the pages and after a few minutes I found a listing for 250 milligrams of furanylfentanyl. I knew what fentanyl was and how it killed people, but didn't know what this furanylfentanyl was. Google it, thought about it and the cheap price tag, bought it. Mistake. I also bought an empty nasal spray bottle and looked up volumetric dosing - usually I am REALLY into harm reduction. Usually.

The day of delivery finally came and I was super excited. I immedietly made a solution with 4 milligrams per milliliter and was happy. Then I inserted the tip of the nasal spray in my right nostrill and sprayed. I waited. I felt kind of fuzzy and warm, spray one more time and felt really great and euphoric - where was my depression and anxiety? I sprayed one more time and then laid down. I had a blast and pretty much redosed all day and then went to bed, stoked to dose again right when I wake up to feel nice again!

Oh boy, me and my addictive personality. As long as nothing happens, I think nothing will happen. I continued this behaviour for about 14 days. That's when I ran out. Oh. Shit. Where did all that furanylfentanyl go?
I immediety ordered again. This time I went for the one gram listing and waited. That's the first time I felt dope sick and it was BAD. I had high doses of furanylfentanyl in my system all day and night. I had to redose at night to not feel sick. I laid in my bed, sweating, crying, aching - you know the drill.
I thought about stopping there, since I was that it was destructive. I barely ate in those 14 days and forgot to drink often. I was living for the high - after 14 fucking days. I planned on only using like every third day. Everything will go well now! I quickly ordered some alprazolam and waited for it to arrive to be ready when the withdrawl hits next time. I also found a sample for heroin, which I ordered. 200 milligrams for ten bucks. Amazing, right?

I counted the seconds till my mail finally came. I was so happy! So happy that I dosed constantly again. For another 14 days. The last 14 days. I spent the first ten days nodding out all day, just doing the usual - binging The Simpsons. Great times. Then I noticed the heroin sample laying next to my bed. I sprayed a few more times and then snorted about 100 milligrams. I didn't even know the dose, I was too fucked up to think. Then I waited 10 minutes and had no increase in effects - fine, here go another 100 milligrams. This is where my memory ends, at exactly this point.
I woke up a few hours later. Nauseous, cold, completly unable to walk in a straight line even though I felt sober again. I thought this was weird, but hey. Some more sprays would help, right? I instantly fell out again. After I woke up again, I was unable to move, breathing was extremly hard, I noticed blue finger nails and was extremly nauseaous and puked in my bed. I just closed my eyes and prayed to Junkie-Jesus. After about half an hour of laying there, I got up and started my computer. I googled my symptoms and realized, I probably overdosed. Near death? No idea.

After, I noticed that six of the ten alprazolam bars were missing, great.
At this point, I panicked, because even after 2 hours, I barely could read because my eyes would drift to the right, it hurt to look left or right, I fell when I tried to walk because of poor coordination and the middle of my chest hurt extremly bad. I thought about telling my mother what happened and suggesting that I want to go see a doctor. But I didn't. I acted normal... after I almost died. I claimed I had the flu or something.

The withdrawl was extremly bad and I basically was in my bed 24/7, still having the weird eye drifting and chest pain. Coordination was a tad better.
Finally, after 7 days the eye drifting was gone and the chest pain too. I was really really really glad, because the eye thing and poor concentration and coordination are signs of brain damage due to lack of oxygen.

At this point the physical withdrawl was basically over. The cravings were really really strong, but no thanks, I won't use opioids ever again. For my mum, who is working hard all day for this family (that's why I can be fucked up all day without anyone noticing) and for me. For everything I did before opioids.

I have basically no memory of the perioid of my opioid use. Really, none. My mum asked me if I wanted the rest of the turkey we had for christmas a few days after my overdose - I didn't even remember what I did on christmas.
Also, yes, the main overdose was very close to christmas. How did my mum not notice, fuck?

Currently, I am doing much better. No cravings, no signs of persisting brain damage - except a really bad memory. I forget stuff all the time. I am occasionally doing other drugs like LSD, amphetamine or ketamine. Matter of fact, I am on speed as I typing this. I am grateful that I broke up with opioids.


If have many pictures of the time, including me nodding out on video, but I don't want to post my face. I however am able to scare some (to me) really haunting pictures of the exact molecules of drugs that almost killed me:

Furanylfentanyl: http://i.imgur.com/eIG9Ry3.jpg

Heroin: http://i.imgur.com/5KODkUn.jpg

Xanax: http://i.imgur.com/kNgqtux.jpg

Here you can see part of my bottom with scratches all over it. My whole legs, butt, chest and stomach is covered in those scratches. I have no memory of scratching, by the way:

Scratches: http://i.imgur.com/kHv9amZ.jpg


Tl;dr:
I found the opioid category on a darknet market, ordered furanylfentanyl, found out how nice it made me feel. Binged on it for 14 days, ran out, withdrawled, ordered again. Overdosed on furanylfentanyl and a 200 milligram sample of heroin the first time. Continued to use, overdosed the second time, on furanylfentanyl and twelve milligrams of alprazolam. Turned blue, woke up, had signs of brain damage. A few days later I felt a tad better - no permanent brain damage. Withdrawled and swore to Junkie-Jesus that I'll never touch opioids again, I can't handle them.


Extra:
Please, you don't have to tell me how stupid those moves were. This is one big fuckup, from start to finish. Why did I choose furanylfentanyl as my first opioide? Because I didn't have much money and said ""Fuck it!"". Why did I do the whole 200 milligrams of heroin all at once WHILE already nodding out? Why did I take the 12 milligrams of Xanax with the furanylfentanyl?
Because I am was a total idiot, too fucked up to make good decisions.

It seems that what I'm doing isn't working :/
So my questions are as follows:
1. Should you use cold water to begin with or warm water?

2. What happens if you use water that is too hot?  I used hot water the second time and I'm wondering if this affected anything.

3. Is the gunk left at the bottom the APAP?

4. Should i stir the mix before pouring it through the filter?  Thereby eliminating the gunk at the bottom by mixing it back in.

5. I have used coffee filters and paper towels for this but neither leave me with a clear liquid.  I believe that the paper towels are better bc it filters much faster (effectiveness is questionable).  The sidebar video says to not drink the liquid unless it is completely clear.  Even filtering twice there is still a color to the liquid so I just went ahead and drank it.  Is this extremely harmful?  It can't be any worse than just taking the pills in solid form correct?

6. Final question.. I believe that I am losing some of my drugs when i do this..  Does anyone else feel the same way?  I wouldn't mind doing it if I felt I was doing it right and it was working but I think that I am just turning the pills into liquid form and filtering SOME of the APAP but not close to all of it.

Sorry for the long winded questions.. I just want to get better at this because taking 6500 mg of APAP just seems like I'm asking for liver failure.

Inactive ingredient?","So bit of a story but bear with me. I've been buying buprenorphine online for the past few months, but recently run out of money and have started going back to the chemist daily. A move for the better. However, since I've been getting the buprenorphine (buprenorphine only, no naloxone) from the chemist, I've noticed that I have an immediate need to go #2 after 5 - 10 minutes or so of the tablet being in my mouth, and anxiety and sweaty hands later in the day. The brand is different to the one I was taking online, which gave me neither of these weird effects. edit Also, nausea, which I had attributed to the buprenorpine itself, but thinking on it it may be this brand too.

Has anyone experienced anything like this? Could it be an inactive ingredient in the brand I get from the chemist?",1486234014.0

I asked how everyone gets arrested for dope. I've been doing this a long long time and have never been caught or pulled over. I was told it was probably because 'I'm a white rich fuck who lives in the burbs'. Just because ive never been caught doesn't mean I'm some rich fuck in some nice ass suburban house. I might be white but I most certainly dont live in a good neighborhood. I don't dress great but I don't dress and act like I'm part of a gang. And I dont do fat shots before driving resulting in getting DUIs.

I know it's not always preventable. Some of us will just get caught, no fault of our own. But you can help prevent it to some degree. Try not to carry dope on you everywhere and if you do, try to hide it on your person better. Don't dress supisiously. Don't do to much while driving. Have a decent hiding spot in your car. 

There are some really awesome ideas on here for hiding dope and staying safe. Rather be safe than sorry and it's worth taking the time to learn some safety tips.

This guy does shit on his own time. Not the standard d-boy *I'll be there in 5 mins, shows up a few hours later*. No, this guy will go MIA for days after I get a text that says ""come through in a couple hours"". He only sells whenever it's convenient for him. He makes me wait for dayssssss.

Now to the good news! =)

I recently reached out to an old coworker when I was sick. We reconnected and made a plan to go to a near by city and cold cop as we both were sick.

I've been scared shit-less of cold copping for whatever reason. I already have bad social anxiety, so doing something like this is way out of my realm of comfort. So we go up to the city, try finding the spot where my coworker has had success, end up getting lost and drive around for awhile. 

All of a sudden during a ride around town, a dude rolls next to our car and asks us if we want boy. We get his number and eventually get a good deal on some pretty fire ecp. He let's us know he'll give us price cuts the next time we come out and sure enough today he delivered on his promise. We got nearly 3 grams for $150. **Praise ~~Jeebus~~** good fortune. 

I'm so glad I have a reliable connect and no longer have to deal with a money hungry, fucking dick head of a d-boy. ~~Junkie Jesus~~ Good fortune has smiled upon me. Cheers fellow bropiates.

I've been on suboxone before, and the induction never stood out to me as being exceptionally difficult. Lately I've been on a fairly long H run and I've been wanting to switch over to suboxone, and I've been having a hard time. On paper I know it's pretty simple; stop using, wait till you're a  26 on cows, and the start dosing 2 mg at a time, giving each dose a good hour to kick in, and stop when you're stabilized. 

Do you consider the switch easy, something that you could fit in to a weekend with little difficulty, or something more daunting, that's difficult to get through?

I've been off and on it since September. Was clean for about 3-4 weeks until the depression got too bad and I got more. 

The worst part is the half life. You have to redose every hour or two. So you have to take it with you everywhere because you can't get through Thanksgiving dinner with your family or your shift at work without feeling the withdrawals. So you bring it with you and go to the bathroom all the fucking time to redose. Then your mom asks your girlfriend if you're okay because you're going to the bathroom so much. But she doesn't know what to say. Because she doesn't know. Or at least she pretends not to - for now. 

When your addiction is at its worst, you can't get a full night's sleep. You wake up every 2 hours or so and HAVE to redose to go back to sleep. Then when you're staying the night at your girlfriend's apartment, you have to figure out how to get up, go to the bathroom, redose, and go back to sleep without waking her up every 2 hours. 

Trying to hide it from your SO is the worst because it's so hard since you have to redose so much. There's only so long she can wonder why you're going to the bathroom so much and only so long she can ignore the bloody tissues in the trashcan.

That's the other thing. Its also very caustic. Completely ruins the inside of your nose. Within a few weeks of constant use, you'll more often than not blow blood every time you blow your nose or sneeze. Then your nose swells up from the damage and you have to get decongestant spray to clear up your sinuses so you can redose. It's also a good idea to have plain saline spray to wash out your nose every couple doses to keep it healthier. Definitely helps a lot. You can take it sublingually but, again, very caustic and ruins the skin under your tongue. 

Eventually you'll definitely get a nasal fixation and love snorting shit so that's fun too.

I love it so much but I don't recommend it to anyone.

Heroin stopped me up, but it wasn't ever too bad. 

I started on Methadone about two weeks ago and just like the last time I was on it, it has stopped me up something fierce. I had only pooped maybe 3 times in the last week, each time it was a very hard compacted turd... yes, turd as in singular. 

Now I really enjoy my poops. I don't like not pooping. So I finally managed to get some stool softeners at the behest of the clinic and a friend of mine. I popped 6 of them, hoping that would hopefully at least have me poop by the next morning. Next day, NOTHING... same hard as shit, same singular turd. 

I took 12 stool softeners between friday and saturday morning. 6 on Friday night and 6 Saturday morning... NOTHING. 

So I strapped on my researchers thinking cap and started researching. I tried using a turkey baster to put milk and molasses up my ass... Poop was blocking the end of the baster... So nada.

Finally I read online that the active ingredient in the stool softener (Senna Glycoside and Bisacodyl) only works 12 hours after being taken orally and only softens the stool. But I read that when taken rectally (think suppository) it will evacuate the bowels within 5 to 30 minutes...

Well all I had were the pills and I had no way to administer it rectally... No oral syringe or even a normal syringe that I could remove the tip from... But I was determined to go poop. It was starting to become unbarabley uncomfortable.

AN IDEA! DING!

I crush 6 of those stool softeners up, add as little water as I can. Now the only way I could think of to administer it up my butt. I am an avid vaper. So I have ton's of empty eye dropper's for the bottles of juice. 

So, a milliliter at a time, I suck up the water/stool softener mix and push the glass dropper up by butt and squeeze the medicine up there. It took probably 20 insertions up there to get all the stool softener up there. I go outside to smoke a cigarette (I know, I know ""Why are you smoking if you vape?!"" I started smoking again when I started doing H again).

I am out there for probably 5 minutes when I start to feel my stomach doing something funky. Next thing I know I feel like I am going to shit myself. I go in the bathroom. immediately shit out a plug of shit followed by the most gloriously relieving shit I have experienced in a long while. 

TL;DR Was stopped up from methadone for a week. Nothing worked. Read that stool softeners orally only soften poo, but when taken rectally work as a potent laxative. Test theory out and profit immensely with a good shit.

This afternoon I am dealing with something that, as I'm finding out, is harder on me than any of the ODs in my life this last decade

One of the worst things about ODs is the aspect of being too young/too soon. This morning an immediate family member died far too young after a years-long battle with terminal illness. She did absolutely nothing to contract this illness, as it is not transmittable/contagious, but in her case hereditary

She didn't use drugs except the occasional puff of weed 2-5 times/year, and sometimes a few drinks at parties or events. 

Was an amazing person, one of my closest allies in this life; I trusted her with more secrets and struggles than anyone else in my immediate fam, and I am just fucking wrecked today after getting the phone call this morning. Tried to prepare for this call for over half a decade since diagnosis... May as well have told me that aliens had just crashed their flying saucer outside of Denver and announced their intention to obliterate the human species from the earth within the next 48 hours

I've lost grandparents and other elderly/much-older family members before to cancer and heart disease etc but this is the first time one of us has been taken off of the earth at such a young and tragic age

I am currently finishing writing the obituary- a very very heavy responsibility that I am incredibly honored to have been asked, but one of the most difficult things I've been entrusted with my entire life

I realize I've not said anything specific about opiates in this post, as it is very much on purpose. She was so concerned with my drug use throughout the years, as her days have been numbered for almost a decade and she wanted nothing more than for me to get away from such a dangerous and risky choice of lifestyle/company/etc

Trying to cope as close to sober as I can manage rn; I *need* to let myself feel the pain and the sadness and the grief in sync with the rest of my family and in real time. We had approx 5 days of knowing this was imminent so I've done a pretty rapid taper down to where now oxy 20s are the strongest I'm doing. Not taking anything that would be easily ID'd as illicit drugs without having to closely inspect and probably google. Can't be walking up to drop dirt in the grave and have a baggie fall out of my coat pocket or something equally horrible/disrespectful (everything including funeral and burial will be happening in a city 7ish hours away by car - and we also don't know yet whether I'll be driving or flying, I'll know by tonight but either will be better all around with an XL bottle of Advil than easily-lost tiny baggies or containers or whatever).

I've known this would be very very tough, and I suppose this is just an expression of grief amongst a community who know all too well how very tough it can be when so young/early. And I titled it ""good grief"" because while we are all heartbroken, her pain and suffering has ended, as it had gotten bad the last year especially.

A vampire doesn't want to be the way he is. A vampire is cursed, with an uncontrolable lust and thirst for something that he just can not do without. A vampire can not explain why he is this way. A vampire knows that without  ones vice he will grow sick and weak.  
Sometimes a vampire has reservations, and doesn't want to let into the urge of tasting the  soft, silky, flesh. Deep inside he knows it's wrong, yet it is unbelievably intimate  and erotic as well. You can not see the urge but he does need it, and that is concrete. I myself am like a vampire in many of these ways. Cursed with an uncontrollable lust, for a substance that I just can not get enough of, or go a few hours with out. As much as I hate it; I love it. As much as it will ultimately be my demise; I covet. Some thing overrides my logical thinking and, takes control. If I were never a vampire my life would be better, seven fold. This curse brings many emotions from nirvana to anger. I'll give in once agin and return to my chamber.

His personality has changed a bit and doesnt invite me over much anymore. (Lives by himself in an apartment and not sure what he does in his offtime)

 Im not meaning to offend here. Main reason im asking is cause i care about my friend and i dont want him going to far down the rabbit hole..usually do the dealers do the harder drugs that they sell?

My buddy tells me this guy got fire. I pick up a gram and try it all is well shit was fire. Well I have two solid rocks left that looked different from the rest in that they're a lighter color and when broken apart they're pure white on inside (like the little dope pebbles or what I perceived to be dope was covered in the dust of the broken down dope in bag.) Well I mix up this shit snd almost all of it didn't dissolve in water and these last two were super week (to the point I only felt the one with mainly powder the solid chunk I felt nothing.). I get curious and break apart one of the unused pebbles and take a tiny piece off and lick it to see if it tastes like dope. It doesn't it tastes kind of like coke and made the part of tongue kinds numb. But I could swear coke dissolved in water and got curious cause I remember someone telling me that a little vinegar is what you add to crack if you're going to shoot it. So I grab vinegar from the pantry and pull up 5-10 units of vinegar and shoot it at this now broken pieces of white I have swirling around in water and shit instantly clears the water color and all the white shit dissolved. So I am pretty certain at this point it's crack so I shoot some to confirm and yep hearts racing and I feel a speedy high. 

I just don't get why someone would throw a fucking crack rock into a bag of dope as a cut wouldn't that be a loss of money? Maybe dide sokehwo got mixed up with some of his shit and bagged it Up wrong maybe someone requested this and he gave is the wrong bag.

All I know is I'm a tad pissed cause I needed dope not fucking crack. Gonna tell my buddy to let his dealer know about this if it was an accident so he doesnt keep serving people wrong product and i think I'm gonna avoid this dealer now. I didn't wanna have to come down from a fucking coke/crack high at work tonight but here I am about to drive into work hear racing and probably gonna be irritable as fuck and tired pretty quickly and through whole night.

Third one: Im going to quit opiates during this month, and have been thinking about MDMA. Would it be good to roll while suffering PAWS? How about microdosing mdma, like 1-0,5 times a week?

The only veins I can actually *see* with any regularity are in my hip, hands, and feet/ankles. Not the best places. Sometimes I can see in my forearm but I've never been able to hit there.

Normally I use the ones on either side of the crook of my right arm, sometimes do the left in the middle of the crook. I am left handed so right's easier for me, plus I can't feel them on the other side for some reason. 

Today I had a hell of a time trying to hit, I actually wasted a shot because I fucked up moving it to a new syringe. :( I was so sad & the second one I made had much less in it cause I was then afraid to waste and get sick. I ended up hitting in my ankle on top of the bone on the inside, basically. I went really slow with the plunger and it went perfectly on like the first try. Is this safe? I see kind of mixed things about using the ankles, but it was so easy after working on this for like a damn hour, lol. So... okay or stupid?

EDIT: also, does dope make your veins pop?? I have been looking at mine since I finally got it, trying to feel it out for next time. Suddenly I have tons of veins everywhere. ?? Is this cause I'm warm now? lol

The final straw came two nights ago, when, after a sketchy pickup from a new dboy, I had to narcan my wife.

I'm a public defender and I'm providing some input on a legislative bill to change the weight thresholds between misdemeanor and felony heroin possession. I ask here because, while I could ask my clients, I don't want to put them in the spot of having their lawyer use them for research and I think that some of them would have reasons not to be completely honest with me (if they've misrepresented their use in court or to me in the past).

Currently, possession of less than 200mg of heroin is a misdemeanor, possession of between 200mg and 1g is a five-year felony, possession of between 1g and 2g is a ten-year felony, and possession of greater than 2g is a twenty-year felony.

I think some legislators are interested in making sure that personal use quantities are not getting draconian sentences. So there's a proposal to change the law so that up to 1g is a misdemeanor, 1g to 2g is a five-year felony, 2g to 5g is a ten-year felony, and over 5g is a twenty-year felony.

My question is: how much heroin do people regularly possess for personal use? Are these changes in line with the idea of keeping regular drug users in misdemeanor territory, or is the 1g cutoff still too low. How much does a regular heroin user buy at a time? How much gets used in a day? 

Also - tell me anything else that legislators who are considering making changes to heroin penalties ought to know...

    So my older brother went and bought some DAMN GOOD H this morning. I was drinking coffee when he went to pick it up and so was he. After I drank 2 cups of coffee I started drinking water to hydrate myself. My brother picked up .8 and he was only gonna do .3 spread throughout a few hours and said I can have the other .5! I recently took a tolerance break and it's only day 3 or 4 since I started back up again. Well I went balls to the walls and did the .5 within an hour in two shots then I rinsed all of my used cottons (about 15-20) and got another fat shot out of that. My brother did his .3 within an hour and a half doing .1 every 30 minutes. Well a few hours go by once we are out of dope and been drinking water to try to stay hydrated. Well we couldn't pee obviously, well my brother ended up vomiting 5 or 6 times and I vomited once but it was outrageously large. This is the first time I ever see someone vomit from H and the first time I vomit from H. Is this relatively normal? There was a point in time where I was IVing close to 2gs a day and never got nauseous. What's your experience with this kind of stuff?

TL/DR: Have any of you ever vomited or seen someone vomit from IVing H? I've only ever vomited from FAT shots of cocaine but never Heroin until today. Could it be that we drank too much liquid and our stomachs couldn't digest it because of heroin?

I have always used 29G 1cc 1/2"" insulin syringes.  I obviously knew about all the other sizes and had even used them, but for some reason I always swore by my 1/2 inchers and preferred them to any other size.

Lately I've been ordering my spikes online from heathwarehouse and it would seem every single 1/2"" 1cc syringe is like $6 per 10 pack.  That's obviously a crazy price to pay when you're buying them by the 100's (though still worth it if you don't have any alternative).

Nonetheless--I began to notice that even using a brand new syringe every single time, after any number of days (2-3) of constant IV use, it starts to become pretty obvious and/or develop tracks a bit if you don't rotate often enough.

So today I received my 100 pack of Advocate 31G, 1cc, 5/16"" insulin syringes.

These are still long enough where I feel comfortable in pretty much any spot, but I'm hoping the difference in gauge makes a difference in how noticable these are.  

Based on the first few uses, you can definitely feel the difference and with any luck I'm ultimately doing the least amount of damage to my veins possible.

I fucking pull over and park right in front of a bus pickup lol and tell my homie to watch the whip. I sprinted across a couple busy streets. Dont know how the fuck i didnt get questioned. Cops everywhere and im wearing a purple shirt, black dirty cig burn ridden pants, havent showered so my long greasy ass hair was a mess, and im like the only lily-white kid on the West side of Chi shitty. So i run up to dude and he's still there, thank fucking god. He's like ""oh boy i knew you was comin back when i opened up the box and saw what was in there. You lucky i dont do this."" Obviously i thanked him, gave him an extra $10 and was on my way

That fucked me up hahah but for the best. I dont make stupid mistakes like that anymore haha",1486506191.0

I'm using a throwaway because whatever whatever whatever. The only reason im even putting this on the internet is because there was so little information on iv opium tincture. I figured might as well ""document"" it since I'm being a guinea pig anyway.

I'm an iv heroin user who works with the elderly. There's one very stubborn but awesome old lady here that managed to convince a doctor to prescribe her opium tincture, then she shared with me.

The tincture I believe is 10mg/ml and I started with a 25 unit shot, did another a few minutes after, and then did an additional 35, from first to last shot it probably was a total of 20 minutes. I took 150mg of benadryl a half hour before the first one to combat any possible histamine reaction from the codeine, I already have a huge dph aswell as opiate tolerance. I also had naloxone on the side incase of respiratory depression.

Upon shooting it I instantly tasted the tincture and felt a rushing/numb sensation in my legs sort of comparable to the rush from dope but centralized in the legs. Before this I have only ever shot dope. The first minute I experienced an elevated heart rate and my face became flush. All of these subsided very quickly. I do/did not feel the alcohol. I only feel the opium slightly despite the very prominent rush. I have plugged it before and had a similar sensation in the legs though less intense. It's been about 50 minutes since the first shot. I was a little nauseous in the beginning and it has mostly subsided as well.

I'm not really sure what else to write about so feel free to ask questions. Oh and yeah I already know this was a very bad idea and that alcohol and codeine are not supposed to be iv'd but you can tell me yourself if you feel so inclined, I'm putting this out in the public and all that so it's expected.

We lived in the suburbs of NJ but we were always right on the cusp so we moved between the hood to suburbia often and easily.

Another show in April and more pending. We're gearing up to drop out first video, Love&Loathing in Suburbia. All heavily drug based lol.

In your parents driveway, looking strung out and thin, wearing a torn up Nirvana shirt. It was too big for you, but it fit the occasion. Your eyes were distant and your voice someone else. You said things were great. You weren't yourself. We stumbled through awkward conversation like scared kids walking the cemetery at night. It wasn't comfortable, but it fit the situation. 

February 21

We had nowhere to go, so we had sex in the woods. I was searching for pleasure at your expense. You felt like a tool, lifeless and tired. I felt like a predator, a parasite, a customer.

I spent years not using until I became disabled and started using for something other than recreational. Which has taught me a lot especially since I was such a bad junkie years ago. My point is, even if I wasn't using I was still a junkie, it's just how it is. 

I grew up in a small mountain town, the only drugs available consistently were shitty pot and shitty crank. Way before the day of ice and shards it was acetone tasting, ugly, dirty, filthy and kept you up for days. I've never liked uppers at all but I do like the drugs and growing up, I had few options so I ended up doing quite a bit of meth in my adolescence but as soon as I got out of that shit hole I found the wonders of a spectrum of different drugs and a myriad more incarnations of strains, batches as well as fun, new ROA's. I quickly dropped meth and aside from a few drunken times of bad decisions with worse people, I haven't looked back with any amount of fondness or warmth or even a craving. In fact I could still imagine that taste of a drop and still gag. 

I'm much more settled in my middle age, I'm married with a beautiful family who my wife and I work very hard to manage and support. As I said I became disabled about 5 years ago and have been back on the opiate train for most of that. As I said before I've learned a lot since my earlier and capricious years and have never had a problem or issue with my use through the years aside from slipping to using heroin when I moved and didn't have my scripts and it's too fuckin expensive to buy on the street. I used to spend 80 in co-pays for a month of Meds and we all know what 80 will get you on the street. I'm lucky if it lasts 2 days but I digress. My wife will, on very rare occasions smoke her meth. She gets extra work done, cleans the house, you know real productive shit.

 Anyway she's always politely asking me to partake on these occasions and I always politely refuse, thinking back to all of those years spent doing God knows what and as much as I try, I can't think of one good memory about using meth. It just one long, incredibly focused, pointless and intense introspective nightmare. I've never cared so much about playing solitaire in my life. My hands were blistered and raw. A new deck of cards looked 10 years old after a night with my grimey, filthy, masterbatey tweaker hands. 

Really thinking about it, I only ever enjoyed the high after being up for 4 or 5 days and sleep deprivation and delusions started to set in. That's not fun. Or healthy. 

Anyway I was out of dope tonight, I don't get paid till the middle of the night and my wife politely asked me at just the right time when all of my common sense is gone. These are the same times in life that I decide to do my wake up shot tonight as more always comes right? Or to buy a ball to last me a minute and I decide it's OK to use the front half in a day cause I can make the back half last just as long by doing half shots right? Or I shouldn't use a condom, I barely know this woman and the fact that she's even thinking about letting me stick my penis inside her, throws up a lot of red flags about her decision making processes to begin with but I'm sure we will make all of the other decisions after this one with maturity, dignity and the grace we've somehow missed out on up until this point. But im sure it will work out right? 

So I smoked some meth tonight. Boy has it changed since it's biker, bathtub crank of the early 80s but the experience is just as bad if not worse than I remember. I got the worst headache I've ever had, they weren't even like headaches. My head and sometimes other parts were throbbing in icy, sharp stabs. (I'm actually still enjoying them. Just not as bad) but just insane amount of pain. Threw up my Chinese food. And I'm still nauseous. My jaw hurts. And the best part is... Im wide awake. I don't even see sleep in my near future and my whole body hurts. The only thing that helps is doing dope. But then of I use the dope I bought late tonight, then I don't have dope when I need it. 

I know that people enjoy this drug. Quite a bit. But I am not one of those people. Nor do I want to be. I have so many friends that use both. But i'ma stick with my opiates and downers. Sorry for the mountain of a story... But im on meth. This shit happens to the best of us. 

TL;Dr: I never enjoyed meth. Did some tonight. Still don't enjoy it. In fact I had the worst time I've ever had on it and I'm still not done apparently. 

Thanks for the vent Kids. Hope everyone is having a great night. ",1486642168.0

I've only known him for a few months but he seems like a pretty straight-up guy, he's got a job, he seems trustworthy, and he doesn't mind my middle tax. Anyway last week he mentioned that he was buying some tar off the DNMs (we only get ECP around here) and that he'd throw me some when he got it. The last time I had tar was¬†about two years ago, and tar is what I started out using all these many years ago, so doing it is always pretty nostalgic for me. So needless to say,¬†I was psyched, but I wasn't going to hold my breath: it's easy to say you'll do something like that, but when the time comes and the drugs are in hand, I've found that people have a much harder time rationalizing their¬†generosity. So I was surprised, to say the least, when I got a text the other day from him saying that he got his package, and when was I going to be in town so he could give me some?¬†


I live an hour away from my ""city"" and I don't have my own car, so I can usually only make it there a few times a week and I can never go just on a whim--I have to plan in advance to make sure that I'll be able to use the car. So my heart sank a little bit, knowing that I wouldn't be able to get there until Wednesday, which was two days away. Who is able to hang on to drugs for two days, especially since he'd only be saving them to give them away. That really takes away one's incentive to hold on to them, I've found. But it turns out that he was willing to hang on to it, and that he'd meet me after work on Wednesday!¬†


At this point, I think it's looking a little more likely that he'll actually keep his word, but I still had a healthy dose of¬†skepticism. So when I texted him to say I was in town, I was¬†pleasantly¬†surprised to get a text in return: ""Leaving work. Meet me at X place in half an hour."" I started to allow myself to think that maybe, just maybe, this could be real.¬†


He ended up throwing me .2 for free and selling me .5 for cost, and he also wasted I'm-not-sure-how-much trying to teach me how to smoke (I couldn't stop coughing! I couldn't get it to burn evenly or to slide, and at one point I knocked the piece off into the center console of my car) so I have now done all of the major ROAs except muscling (does that count as a major ROA?). This was all incredibly generous of him, especially when you take into account how expensive dope is around here. Bags are normally only .03, .05 if we're being liberal with our weight estimations. It's $15 for singles, and $60 for a half bundle/$120 for a whole (10 bag bundles here). And he could have sold the .5g for $120: instead, he sold it for $70. 


So basically this guy, who I don't really know and who I've only been middling for over the past couple months, just gave me the¬†equivalent of 4 bags for free and sold me the equivalent of a bundle for almost¬†half priced,¬†if we're converting it to my local dope currency.¬†


I apologize for the length of this post: I'm pretty fucking high and also just refilled my Vyvanse after not having any for 2 weeks, so I'm rambly right now. ¬†But I wanted to share with everyone because I like you guys and I finally had something worth boasting about! ¬†¬†


I hope your nights are all going well, ¬†and that you're all getting well too. ¬†Much love, and stay safe!¬†


**TL:DR:** Guy I middle for gave me a lot of free and/or discounted product.¬†

I have planned that tomorrow will be the last time I use opiates. But.. before that im going to have a nice goodbye party. 
I have one 80mg pill of Oxycontin and 500grams of poppy seeds. Last time I drank PST was about 4 months ago, and my dosage was 1-1,5kg of seeds a day divided in two servings. My tolerance got high and I didnt want to drink all of that liquid anymore, and the seeds started to cost too much. Thats when I started using subutex via insufflation, 1-3mg/day. It was a lot cheaper than the tea, I didnt have to ""shake the bottle"" and all I had to do was crush it up and inhale. It was great for a few months, but then again I couldnt get high anymore off the 2mg and was using way too much money - again. So, now I have decided to call it quits. But first, the party..

I was thinking of drinking the tea (500grams) when i wake up, and was wondering if I should eat the whole 80mg pill at the same time or crush it up and dose twice?
I havent used oxys very much, so im kinda in the woods here. :P Today at about 2pm I took 40mg oxycodone crushed and it didnt quite hit the spot. Got a great mood lift and some mild euphoria, meh. Redosed after some hours and had almost no change in effect. I also took 250mg Pregabalin 3-4hours prior my first dose of oxycodone.

I will be smoking weed through the whole day, like I usually do.
I also eat 1mg clonazepam a day, but ive eaten only 0,5mg per day for the last two days to boost the euphoric effects of oxy. 

What should I do? Would be pretty damn disappointing to ""fuck up"" my last high, so I want to get the dosage right. Is it too much to  take the tea and oxycontin all at once? Feels like it could be a good dose, but then makes me wonder if its too much.",1486613247.0

Well I said no at first as I'm trying to stay clean. Then she said ""Well I am gonna give them to you so they are out of my house as my kid took one today and I figured you would want them but I'm sure you can find someone that wants them. They are free as my insurance paid for all of them."" 

So I said sure my mom I'm sure would be happy to have some spares. She said there were twenty of them left. And she had some of the pills she got for her anxiety during a flight she had. So she handed me the bottle and I couldn't believe what I saw!!! 4mg hydromorphone!! And what's this? Is that Xanax? Never saw yellow bars so I looked it up and sure enough R039 were in fact 2mg bars, she only got ten of those and seven of the 2mg bars. 

I fought with it for the whole day telling myself I am gonna give them (the Dillies as I take temazapam 30mg nightly and 2mg kolonopins every six hours.

Whiles Dillies don't last long they hit you like a wall once the tourniquet was removed. 

I'm gonna enjoy these while I can as who am I to say no from a gift from JJ? I had to share my excitement with others here as it was just to hard to say no to freebies like that.

I knew what was going on, usual prices around here are 3 for ¬£25 but I wasn't completely sure enough to call him on it. Finally one night another guy was there scoring too, I said I was getting 2 as cash was tight so he threw in ¬£5 and said get him 1 as well. My middle panics a bit, tries to shake his head without me seeing and they both jump into the worst acting I've ever seen;  
Middle: ""What mate, that's not enough, it's ¬£10 you know that.""   
Guy:  "".............oh... right... so it is *both glancing at me*, my bad.... can you lend me ¬£5 then as that's all I've got?""   
M: Yea don't worry mate, I'll sort it out.  
At that point I just wanted my bags, so I called him later that night and said to cut the shit, we're not doing that anymore. Of course he gives a million excuses, we reach an agreement and all is well. Or so I thought!  
He decided soon after that if he couldn't get 1 of each, he'd just fuck both of us over. If I go there and don't pretend not to hear him order himself 2 items + pay for it, he'll just deliberately go to someone with shit gear. When I complain the answer is always the same, ""well mate you know the good shit is ¬£10/b, what did you expect at 3 for ¬£25?"". Bare in mind including travel this means I'm paying ¬£34 for 2 bags as I'm still giving him 1, but he'd rather lose out himself than charge me a fair amount.

Anyway I'm rambling, this post is supposed to be about his pup. A few years ago he adopted an ex fighting dog, it was a lot of work but after a while he became the friendliest guy I've ever seen. Yet every time I'm there he'll smack the shit out of the poor thing, scream at him if he dares get off his bed etc. It's got to the point that the dog recognises me because I always spend my entire time there smoothing / playing with him. I'll always try to protect him as best I can, if my middle starts shouting at him to get in his bed I'll always say like ""ahh don't worry mate, he's fine with me"" but there's only so much I can do. I'd be very surprised if I wasn't the only person that showed the poor guy any affection at all, the way his eyes light up when I arrive speak volumes :(  

Even tonight this bastard middle just couldn't resist fucking me over. Money is tight at the moment so I only had ¬£20 to spend, and despite me repeatedly assuring him I'd get him back after I was paid at the weekend he still went and bought the shit gear. Think about that for a second, he chipped in his last ¬£5 buying shit *just so I wouldn't get the nice stuff at a reasonable price*. 
I hate the fact I keep giving this cunt money and don't say something about the dog, but what can you do?  
I'm seriously considering just cleaning up and sticking to my Mdone script, that shit tonight was the last straw.",1486602947.0

So yesterday at work I decide to call my phone connect for half a bundle of that good shit. He's usually not around in the morning and I don't really have the time to see him after work. But this day i was tired of my regular connect so i tell my wife I have to stay at work late to help out and that buys me about 45 extra minutes. I have to be very careful because the wife is on to me and I need to account for every extra minute that I am late. can't just walk in the door an our late with no story or else she will know I was out doing something i shouldn't. So, I call this connect 2 hours early and tell him I will be there exactly at 6:20. So as I am leaving work i call him to make sure he is going to be there and of course it's one of his team members that can barely talk and doesn't know where his stuff is and I get the old...""lemme call you right back"". Basically meaning ""I don't want to talk to you and I'll never call back"". So time is of the essence and I am running out of it quickly. the dope spot is about 30 minutes from home and I already told the wife I was on the way home. UGH! so now I have to call my 2nd guy who has the skimpy bags but at least I will have dope for the evening and tomorrow morning. Plus I ALWAYS meet him in the same spot, right off the exit ramp and it makes getting in and out quickly. I call guy #2 but he's out with his girl and the baby bowling. He is reluctant to meet me but after I beg him he agrees. He tells me the general area of the bowling alley and says to call him when I'm there and he will direct me.....ok, it's only like 10 more minutes out of the way and now the timeline is getting tighter and I know I can't waste too much time or I will have some explaining to do. So here is where it all goes wrong....I am a few blocks away of where I am going to mee my guy and i pull my phone out of my pocket. I must have hit the wrong button combination of power, volume etc. because I started an automatic factory reset of the phone!!!!!!! I'm like NO! NO! NO! I can't even call him from a pay phone because I don't know the number, it's stored in the phone....Shit, fuck, shit, fuck I'm screaming as time is ticking, ticking faster and faster. I was driving in the hood looking for a bowling alley but I had no clue where it was. I pulled over in a BK parking lot as I sat there and watched my phone erase all the data, do the updates and everything. Now I'm really late and trying to think of an excuse to tell my wife...I considered just aborting the mission and going home but i was so close I could taste the dope. After about 20 minutes I finally got to a point where I could make a call. I go to the contacts and more than half are missing. Of course the one number I need to call the man isn't there. I only have his personal phonde which he told me to never use, only in emergency...well this was an emergency. So I call it and he is freaking pissed that I used that number, and now he is even more pissed because I said I was right around the corner before my phone reset. Now I am trying to get directions to where he is and he blurts outs at the corner of X and Y street but go down Y a little then it's on a left.......I am now driving frantically in circles trying to find this place and I have to call him again. He says he is in the parking lot waiting and if i'm not there in 2 minutes he is going inside. Meanwhile I'm getting texts and calls from my wife wondering where I am. I have sweat dripping down my forehead as people are driving 2 MPH in front of me.....Suddenly I see it there a half a block down, a big bowling pin and bowling ball. I make an illegal left turn and whip into the exit of the lot. My dude comes over and I apologize for the mess and he is laughing more than he is pissed. Anyway, we make the deal as I'm parked illegally in a handicap spot and I don't even move. As soon as he leaves I dump 2 bags out on my phone, roll up a bill and sniff it up, and it was then that I looked over the divided highway and there was a patrol car with 2 cops sitting in it half looking my way. It was a busy location and I don't know if the were hip to what was going on or not, but if they were even half paying attention they would have stopped me. I stashed my shit and whipped outta there, texted the wife I ran into some bullshit and would be home in 30 minutes. Now all had wrecked my nerves so bad I had to pop a xanax bar that I copped the day before. I don't take them often and when i do they really hit hard. In hindsight I maybe shouldn't have taken a whole bar because by the time I got home I could barely keep my eyes open so I just tried to play it off to my wife that i had smoked a bunch of weed at work before I left and had a beer. She just started to laugh at me and asked if I took anything because I couldn't even keep my eyes open as I was scrolling the TV guide. I just gave her the remote and told her to pick something which I never do. She knew i was on something when I gave up the remote, that was my downfall. If I never gave up that remote I could have stuck to the story that I didn't do anything. Finally in the morning I told her that I had a hard day at work and took a pill that someone at work gave me to help calm my nerves. She just looked at me and laughed because I was more than relaxed.....I was faded.",1486594386.0

I go into my car and find a full wine bottle and open it and we are going hard, killing this wine bottle smoking some dank he has rolling spliffs between us.

Then a dea agent asks me where I'm from, how much I pay and how long an appointment last and at this point I'm about to call a lawyer I personally know because I didn't want to say anything to get my sub doc in trouble or myself in trouble.

(Big wall of text)","You say that forcing people into a black market that more often than not ends up with the addict dead or in jail is common sense. I say you're wrong. It's cruelty directed at people who have a disease (addiction) and the way they are treated would never be countenanced if it were any other disease (imagine if Parkinson's medication could only be found on the black market and you risked death because of the quality of the product, with felonies and jail time if you were caught with your medication). 

Ideas like yours and the policies that come with them walk right up to the line of pure, concentrated, unabashed evil. 

Here's why. 

Heroin (and this goes for all opiates, as well) is one of the least harmful drugs to your body (when the product is pure and not adulterated, and administered properly).

Heroin causes no long-term damage to the systems in the body. It doesn't hurt your liver (like alcohol), it is not carcinogenic (like tobacco and alcohol), it doesn't hurt your brain (alcohol), it doesn't harm your lungs (tobacco), and it doesn't cause any damage to the liver, kidneys, stomach, esophagus or mouth (alcohol and tobacco). 

It bears repeating, if the product is pure unadulterated heroin, not only is it safe for your body's systems as outlined above, it's also fairly difficult to accidentally overdose on by itself (it becomes much more dangerous if you start mixing it with alcohol or benzodiazepines). 

You can chalk up an enormous percentage of accidental overdoses to the consequences of its illegality.

1. There is no such thing as quality control when you're buying street drugs. Dealers package the product with different ""cuts"" which leads to wildly varying amounts of the active ingredient between batches and even in bags within the same batch. The consequence of this is an addict doing what they believe should be their normal amount, when in actuality they've gotten a batch that is 3 times as strong, and they accidentally overdose as a result (it's not as if you can judge the purity of the product by looking at it).

2. Because of the profit motive and the difficulty of smuggling the product out of war torn regions such as Iraq and Afghanistan, dealers have started cutting their product with Fentanyl and its analogs. Fentanyl is 50-100 times more potent than morphine by weight (it's dosage is measured in *micro*grams), and its analog carfentanyl is 10,000 times more potent than morphine by weight. In the same space you can traffick a kilo of pure heroin with a street value of around $250,000, you can substitute that with a kilo of pure fentanyl worth $5,000,000.

3. The rise of Fentanyl and its analogs is the true face of the overdose epidemic that we're currently experiencing here in the U.S. Heroin has been around in the U.S. for well over a century, with its heyday being the 1930s, and from that point until around 10 years ago there was plenty of heroin to go around, but not nearly the amount of overdose deaths per capita. This is chiefly because Fentanyl wasn't invented until the 60s and didn't become well known until the late 90s when the parent company that invented it started actually marketing it to cancer patients and children through their Actiq Lollipops in a variety of flavors.

4. As overdose deaths involving intravenously injected opiates are almost invariably reported as a ""heroin overdose"", the public and policymakers are being mislead and it results in them misidentifying the actual culprit and cause of the overdose, which in all but a minority of cases turns out to be fentanyl.

If heroin were given the same treatment that marijuana is being given in the states where weed is now legal for recreational use, we would see a decrease in deaths that would be absolutely staggering. We would also save tens of millions (if not more) on healthcare costs, court and jail budgets and the lives of twenty to fifty thousand addicts a year.

Quality controls on the product, clean syringes (don't get me started on pharmacies not wanting to sell syringes), educational opportunities on how to safely and cleanly IV, and help for addicts who want to quit the lifestyle. Also, there would be none of the severely life-damaging felonies for simple possession that keep people from acquiring gainful employment in their future which only serves to keep people circling the drain instead of getting on with their lives in a prosperous, productive manner.

The worst part of all of this is the current policies and ideas surrounding heroin and other opiates is based on a completely subjective measurement of the ""infamy"" and ""wickedness"" of the drug. It is prejudiced and in no way based in reality. It only serves to reinforce the already substantial stigma around heroin, which keeps people speaking about it in hushed tones and behind closed doors instead of having an honest, open and frank discussion about the problem and its solutions. Most people know or have a loved one who has had trouble with opiate addiction, and I ask you, ""What happened to compassion?""

We need to recognize that addiction is a disease like any other, and that the people are not choosing to put themselves in the existential danger of addiction, but rather are suffering from it, and need to be afforded the respect and dignity that they deserve as human beings and as fellow citizens. This is a problem that can be solved, but as we can see from the lack of success of the current policy and thinking, it needs a fresh look in an honest way without being tied down to the prejudices of the past.",1486584778.0

He's 18, finished secondary school (high school for you lot across the pond) with horrible horrible horrendously shit (day 3 of withdrawals type shit) grades, had big drug problem from age 12 with alcohol, weed, speed and benzos. How does a twelve year old pay for all this shit when his parents are piss poor after the recession. He has to do some questionable shit right ? 

Lying, stealing and cheating from age 12 he knows pretty much nothing else by fourteen. Destroying the only people in the world who love him unconditionally with worry, financial trouble, causing huge stress in the house and parents marriage. Above all his relationships with his family were wearing thin. What can they do ? Kick out a 14 yo ? I don't think so. He has them trapped. 

All the while turning tricks became more attractive than stealing from his family and loved ones. He starts coming up with fake raffles, shoplifting (master when on benzos for some reason) and essentially extortion. Threats of violence, beatings kidnapped. You know the normal shit 16 year olds get up to. 

All his shitty junkie pals do the same is just one of the many many things he says to justify this type of life to himself. Caught with 7 grams of weed. Sweet not even a slap on the wrist he's 16 but now he's on the guards (cops for the 'muricans) radar. They know what's up. 

He's now graduated at 17 to much harder drugs like LSD, coke and the devils mistress heroin. Tripping as frequently as twice a week for 2 months possible not realising the effects it would have on him (mainly episodes of psychosis.) He's smoking weed by the boat load and taking doses of LSD of above 1500mcg on the regular. What can go wrong ? ""You just wouldn't understand lad I'm expanding my perception of life and shit man."" He uses as his excuse. Another run in with the law. 7 grams of mdma 4gs of coke and an Oz of weed in a raid (tipped off by his loving parents who only want their piece of shit son to grab the world by the balls and make a go of life.)

He has no choice but to leave his hometown in rural Ireland. He just can't stay there anymore. Neither he nor his parents can stand him and this situation. He doesn't mean or want to do this to his amazing family and sister. He finds himself In a city 250,000 plus population from a village with 500 give or take. He doesn't want to leave but he knows he has to or will end up never mending relationships and probably dead within 18 months (will get to that part) 

18 rolls round and he gets a job! Brilliant a new lease on life. A great opportunity with good money for the position. But what does he do with his money ? He wants to save some, start paying back debts and actually functioning as a normal human being. But no his junkie ass goes on a massive benzo bender blacks out for a week on highly potent RC benzos as the whole getting legal drugs delivered right to the door was just so enticing. Loses said job after causing hundred of pounds of damage by crashing a forklift 3 times (maybe more can't remember.) 

Loses his best friend and favourite person in the entire universe. Turns to the needle. Bare in mind he has been smoking for damn near two years at this point. It's now been 3 months of daily shots since graduating trying to temporarily get rid of that constant pain in a wave of beautiful euphoria. He wishes he could go back in time but thats never going to happen. He wishes he could take back everything he put his family through. The hurt the worry the trouble the excuses the arguments and having a punch up with his daddy dearest. 

He can't and he won't. He will continue to shoot this poison into his blood stream and float away from the memories that trouble him so very badly. 

He's at the lowest point of his life and feels he has nowhere to turn except the seemingly very kind people on this sub. Not for pity or sympathy. We all have backgrounds but I just wanted to share some of mine. 

Anyway off to score Dboy just text back. Happy nods.",1486712722.0

Today, I drove the couple of hours to the closest major city to cop a bit of dope since the dope in my city is A. Super expensive B. Super duper cut C. Sold by awful dboys who apparently can't tell time or D. All of the above.:-{

 Anyway, I copped some boy from a good dbuddy of mine who I've been going through for quite a few months now and all went well, and afterwards, my friend who rode down with me wanted to cop some girl, so he called his connect and we make our way over to the hotel that dude is staying at. 

This was my first time I ever met this connect but was assured he was good people. He is straight from Hades and doesn't exactly speak the greatest English, but it didn't really cause any issues given that drugs is an universal language. He even gave me his number and Facebook name so I can hit him up when I'm not with my friend. Sweet, good shit. 

I texted Mr Hades to let him know it's me. The first response I get is, ""If I know you been here... I would of tell you to bring a puppy dog for my room..."" uhhh okay. I asked him if he meant a real puppy dog while internally wondering if the language barrier got in the way and that there was no way he'd want to trade someone he's a never met before a small domesticated animal for hard drugs. He replies, ""real puppy one.. Can't trust nobody in this hotel.. The dog will keep me alert."" 

oooooookkkkaaaaaay. Now I found this hilarious and jokingly asked him if hed like a chihuahua or a wiener dog and if he wanted a baby or a full grown dog, which he then tells me ""a baby one so I can raise him in my own.. Chihuahua is kinda of to small....i want dog when some somebody to stay the fuck away from my dog...if you do that for me... I take care of you."" 

I have now deduced that my new dboy would like to seriously trade an animal for hard drugs, which while odd, seemed like a reasonable trade. I told him I'd see what I can do and will keep him updated. 

I have no idea what prompted him to ask someone he never met before today right away but I am high as hell for the first time time in a few weeks while using daily (fuck tolerances) and felt I finally had something to share with all my bropiates and bropiatettes that was worth coming out of the shadows of the lurk. Good night and happy nods everyone! 

TL;DR: new connect asked me to give him a baby puppy in exchange for my babies",1486704163.0

 I'm looking online for other instances like this but i can't find them. how do you deal with this? 

edit: i told his dad everything and he took her name off of every bank account and the business- now I'm being told that this wasn't my business and i shouldnt have done that- was it wrong to do that if the house and business were going to be seized because of this alleged drug problem?

You all told me not to do it anymore and that I was stupid for thinking this way. I just thought to myself ""man what do these guys know let me buy a bun"".

I am sorry. I know you guys were just trying to help me and I foolishly didn't listen to your advice. I made my mother cry last night. I haven't done that in a long time, I haven't even seen her cry in a long time but I saw it last night. I am not myself anymore. I can't think like myself anymore. I don't feel good like I used to anymore. I don't feel high like I was before. 

I sold my xbox about a week ago to get some more money to give to my dealer. My dad's present to me. I remember thinking getting that xbox is the best present a guy could have. And it was. I never got bored of it. I loved COD, gears of war, assassin's creed, and I sold it along with all of those games for another fucking cop of diesel. 

I want to thank you guys so much for warning me, and apologize once more for ignoring it like the fucking dick head I am. I am in a rough spot right now. I can't think straight right now. I'm scared. Im scared of what's in my future. I miss the past. 

I'm sorry if this posts is written weird...the time you hook to read this post is probably the same exact time it took me to type it bUT I just feel I needed to owe you guys an apology.

Please. If you're thinking of trying heroin please please please do not do it. It's not fun anymore. Please don't do it. Please listen to the good people here who tell you not to fuck with it. Please don't make the same mistake I made. Because at this point I don't think I can manage much longer. 


Please just don't snort that bag. Please just be clean from it. You're too precious for this drug and you can't imagine what it would do to you. What you can become. What you would do for another cop of heroin... I'm crying right now so excuse any typos. 

I wished I listened to you guys. Feel free to call me a dumbas for not following your advice. I already know how stupid I seem now.

Sorry again... and sorry to the people Ive turned down advice.

I've used opiates on and off for like ten years, never developed a habit. I've used hydro, oxy, codeine, dihydrocodeine, heroin, poppy seed and pod tea, and (not exactly opiates) u-47700, kratom, tramadol and tianeptine. 

While all of these effect the strength of my urine stream to some extent, even to the point of sitting frustratedly on the toilet for like a half hour nodding out on H. Only recently, however, has it seemed to be a real problem. About a week ago, I took a hefty knockout dose of poppy seed tea for the first time in a while, and had such profound difficulty urinating that I couldn't go at all for over 24 hours. I went into the ER to be catheterized. Such fun. Anyway, being the genius I am, I thought I could get away with a lower dose a few days later. Got pretty high but not nearly as high, and was still unable to squeeze anything out for like 12-15 hours. Eventually I was able to void enough that I didn't feel I needed to be catheterized. 

I've used poppy tea plenty before, and even got significantly higher on it. Even on H, I could eventually go without too much hassle. Why all of a sudden should I get this side effect so intensely? Is this the end of my opiate use? Any of you regularly go so long without urinating? I still have a huge bag of seeds, and I ain't the flushing sort. That said, I don't want to be the tube-up-my-dick sort either.

I got clean and was disgusted by the fact that dealers have been straight up killing peope by selling fentanyl cut shit. When my UA at the methadone clinic popped for fentanyl AND methamphetamine when my dealer assured me I had straight  heroin, I said fuck it. I walked into the PD and asked to speak to a drug detective and I explained how within a few months of copping street dope I had become familiar with most street dealers, gangster delivery lines, and their mid level suppliers by name. I told them I didn't want a thing from them I just knew how near impossible it was for them to get an undercover snitch in the game so I would do it provided they had my back as far as minor transgressions of the law on my part would go.

First we popped a couple street dealers. Then we busted into some motel rooms and flipped a couple guys. I watched as one of the roided out Kojack lookin' cops beat the fuck out of a speed freak dealer who spit on the arresting officer's face. It felt really good to be taking people off the streets and intimidating scumbags. I immediately learned that just because they are cops that they don't necessarily not break laws. I saw a lot of people's rights get violated and a lot of violent beatings after people got mouthy or someone went for a weapon.

We worked up to mid level dealers and started shutting down delivery lines. It was as simple as roughing up junkies and making them call the lines and rushing the cars when the dudes showed up. I would sit in the cruiser with blacked out windows and watch this shit go down. It was thrilling seeing cops with automatic weapons blow off door handles and rush into houses I used to cop dope from.It got to the point where I realized we could do anything we wanted because politicians and citizens just want fentanyl off the streets. I didn't feel bad at all and I saw how little loyalty is in the game when these supposed gangsters and flashy young high rollers would flip on their plugs the moment the cops started talking about 15-20 years for dealing fent and then adding murder charges on top for the dead junkies they leave in the wake. In the end we worked our way up with my help to the main suppliers of this fent cut shit in town. Last I heard the detective I was working with raided a guys house after his drop received a shipment of carfentanil from china and immediately flipped. I taught the cops all about ordering fent off the Internet and how to track ppl through postal deliveries . The guy Is hells angel connected and is going to do many years. I believe he was the top of the chain as we would realistically get. He's gonna get charged for murder of three people who died using fentanyl cut heroin from dealers working under him. I never got any of the glory at the press conference after but we know what we did. The guys I worked with had violent tendencies but were family guys, overall good people who wanted to make the city safer for them and their children.

It was great and I would do it again. I never saw so much drugs or cash in my life, as well as shitty old handguns and beat up ak47s. I don't consider myself a true snitch because I never did it to get out of any years. I had a personal vendetta against these guys for straight up murdering people in the name of greed and money. I would do it again no questions asked. I did get a silent get out of jail free card for minor law related transgressions and the good grace of the local drug cops. I got to beat the shit out of the wannabe tough guy gangsters who used to treat me like shit and make fun of me when I would cop dope off them as a junkie. I remember once I was short a few bucks and they threw my money out the window as they were driving and made me get out on the side of the road, sick as shit. I can't describe how amazing it felt to beat the fuck out of this dude while his buddies sat watching in cuffs as these cops cheered me on. They tell me that fentanyl related ODs have gone down drastically since our operation and they told me they couldn't have done it without me. 

I grow pot and sell steroids now, the cops I worked with know I do and don't bother me as long as I don't cause trouble. I admit I'm a little worried about repercussions from these gangsters so I pack a heater now but truthfully, I saw what bitch ass cowards these dudes are and I'm not scared of what comes. I would be glad to throw down against any of them flashy punks and I accept whatever happens.  I made the streets safer, we confiscated and kept some of their cash for ourselves, and we destroyed hundreds of thousands dollars worth of drugs. I am going to write a script about it and one day you folks can watch my somewhat glorified experiences on the big screen.

For anyone who wants to call me a rat- go ahead, I did more for the better of society than you ever will. We saved lives. We directly targeted dealers putting fentanyl into the drug supply. We let a lot of low end user-dealers go in exchange for info, and lemme tell you 95% of people talk when they are facing years. The take home lesson for me is the people involved in the drug trade have zero honor or loyalty. Those flashy gang tats and affiliations mean fuck all when they are sitting in cuffs.

There have been 20 deaths in our county, and so far we've had 4 families come and talk to us about a loved one they know recently passed. My brother actually had straight up Carfentanil in his system. We learned it's a new trick that drug dealers do to cheapen cost, I guess it's mass produced in China, and so powerful a drop could cause you to OD.

I try to get pure Oxycodone IR whenever possible instead of Percocet... but for the days I can only get Perc 5/325mg, I need about 30-40mg of the Oxycodone to be where I wanna be in my state of mind right now.. but that's 2,600mg straight through the liver all in one shot... when taking Perc's with tylenol I'll take 3 (975mg), wait an hour and then take the other 3 (totally about 2 grams of tylenol.. I figure it takes around 30min for the tylenol to metabolize so by an hour later it'll reduce the amount of damage compared to taking it all at once..

TL;DR: you should really read everything I wrote about, but my main concern and point is, I've only been using Percocet for a little less than a year now let's say, rarely ever exceeded even 650mg of tylenol in a day back a few months ago (due to my lower tolerance).. but for the past two months my tolerance is about 30-45mg of Oxy in one shot...  if I consume 3,000mg of tylenol all in one shot is it going to seriously damage my liver if it's a once in a while things? I don't feel confident doing a CWE (sounds retarded I know, especially being an over thinker and how easy it is to do, but I feel like I'll up and lose my Oxycodone or perhaps the tylenol winds up filtering through hence making it pointless... and somewhat healthier 18 year old male)

TRUE TL;DR: will 3,000mg of tylenol all in one shot destroy my liver ONCE in a blue moon when I cannot acquire my Oxycodone without acetaminophen (tylenol)? People have been doing it for years 8,000-12,000mg of tylenol a day and their liver is in great shape...

I am an addict... have been for a long time. (pills, never anything other than oxy's etc). I for the longest time could put them down and it would not bother me. (never went thru w/drawls etc)....until this past year. I take FULL responsibility for my addiction....but, had a little help getting to the point I am at now. I have heard the saying my physician was my 1st drug dealer and I can honestly say that to be true in my case. I could have said No I realize that now but at the time I trusted my DR and really thought he was looking out for my best interest. I am in the health care field and truly trusted that man... he was probably one of the smartest physicians I had ever worked with. He is now in Federal Prison for selling, using, and writing scripts to patients who did not have a legit reason for the scripts. I have some health issues and also PTSD so of course I could justify (my addict personality) the ""need"" for all the narcotics and benzo's. After he went to prison, I was introduced to a dealer... one of the bigger ones in my area. He seemed decent always came through... lol if you cant trust your dealer who can you trust? ... being sarcastic of course. Like I said I am  a oxy addict... not even smoke green... One time about a year ago I stopped by his house to get a few blues... he shut the door after I came in the house... and needless to say he said why dont you try some green that might help your pain issue plus it would be a lot cheaper. Dummy me agreed to try it... it was way to strong and it pretty much knocked me out. What happened next.. I will not go into detail but he got a hold of me and there was no getting away from him. I was devastated... it was like looking into the devils eyes. I was a wreck for a very long time. In fact I went to rehab shortly after that happened. I caught myself thinking if I didn't go back he would ""cut me off"" (I NEVER went back). I never got stuff for free I always paid. I knew it was time to get help. Fast forward to a year later... like I said I have some health problems... and had to have a few surgeries. Even though I had been clean and not using... my tolerance was unreal nothing I took in the hospital touched my pain. I wondered if it was my addict ""minion"" just wanting more or if in fact my tolerance was so high that it was impossible to get any kind of comfort. I know I am a hypocrite because I did not tell anyone in the hospital I was in rehab etc.... the stigma that goes with a healthcare provider and addict is horrific. I told my husband what had happened (I told him right away)....he knew who he is but we decided to just leave it alone... I never go near that area of town... I do not know what would happen if I ever saw him... I am afraid my PTSD would get the best of me. So, lessons learned unfortunately in a very very bad way. I did all the testing and thank God I am clean... As far as pain... I take what I am supposed to and nothing more, but something happened to my receptors because nothing seems to help.... Thank you for listening. I by no means posted this for sympathy I know I am responsible for what happened to me... I am sure I am not the only person he has done this to. I know better than to put myself in that situation but its amazing what my addict brain would have done.   ",1486679112.0

do any of y'all feel like this is true or am i just being weird and overly sensitive? i am being really, really careful doing this because i can't afford to miss and have my hand swell up because i am typing all day at work with coworkers peaking over my shoulders and shit. 

also, possibly the shorts have something to do with this? it's not a burning feeling like a miss, just a dull pain that i don't seem to experience normally. i almost always use longs and obviously have only hit in my hands a handful (hehe) of times. 

are there any other good spots to hit with shorts other than the hand and i'm assuming feet? my wrist, crook and forearms all need longs at the moment because my veins got aggressively ambushed by heroin this past week and retreated like cowards.
