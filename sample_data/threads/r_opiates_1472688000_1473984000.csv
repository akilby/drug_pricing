I'm taking a break at work, just did the other half of a blue I saved for myself this morning and I'm jamming out to Good Ass Intro by Chance the Rapper. I'm gooooOoood lol. How many of you guys have good jobs in this sub? Do you use to perform better at work? I can bust some shit out if I got a few blues but they're so damn expensive out here!

I was super high, but still couldn't sleep. I've done dope before and it has made me fall asleep. That's the whole reason I used it. But I did the dope at like 2am and the last time I did some meth was around 8pm, so I don't think that caused it. Especially since I've used it to sleep before and it worked fine. So I guess it was cause it was tar? Who fucking knows. All I know is that I'm gonna have to be on a shit ton of meth today if I plan on staying awake all day. I still have more of that dope. Should I give it another shot  (heh)? Maybe I didn't do enough. I use way too much meth at a time but whenever I do dope I always don't do enough cause I think I'm gonna die or something.

The report lists out all the opioids including buprenorphine but only includes the brands of buprenorphine that are indented for pain management (Belbuca, Buprenex, Butrans).  Suboxone is not for pain management.  Do you think this is an oversight?

The MedWatch concern is the double use of CNS depressants.  Certainly there are opioids that are not CNS depressants (thebaine).  I always take Suboxone (1 mg) in the morning and have never felt any drowsiness, even when I was taking 8 mg.

Here you go:


I don't post on this subreddit much anymore and don't really plan on doing so. For years, /r/opiates was my home page so it was always right there every time I opened my browser, but a few months ago I had to change it. It's been almost two years since I've touched an opiate and have learned a lot along the way. One of those things that I learned was how fucking selfish addicts can be, and how often we refuse to acknowledge how much of a piece of shit we're being/have been/are going to be. I no longer see any appeal in dope porn. I no longer find joy or laugh when I read crazy JJ stories. I no longer find solace in hearing about a day in the life of another addict.

Coming on this subreddit bums me the fuck out. Badly. Every time I come back on here to see how things are going, it seems like I'm reading more and more horrible things every time I visit. More and more glorification of theft, deceit, neglect, or just straight up abuse. I haven't logged nor am I referring to anybody or anything specifically but all I can say is that as time goes on and as you distance yourself more and more from the junkie that you once were, you realize more and more how fucked up of a person you were, how much of it was truly your fault, and how much of it you failed to ever acknowledge. Maybe it's been here all along and I've simply failed to notice it until recently. I'm not sure.


I don't think I'm cool with coming on here anymore. Every time, all it seems to do now is make me either angry or depressed. I fail to see, like I once did years ago, why opiates and the lifestyles that accompany it are ever glorified. There is no fucking higher power that made you into a piece of shit. You made yourself into a piece of shit. Stop doing bad things to people for your own selfish motives of staying well or getting high. If you don't do immoral shit to other people, then good for you, as you would have been a rarity had I ever met you throughout my years of using. I hope that you all can stop using and see life for what it is, and not what you keep yearning for it to be. It's really not that bad. 


Thank you to Stormy, FashionablyFake, the other mods, and anybody else who may have kept me company in any way, whether via replying to me on this subreddit, or shooting the shit with me in the chat back in the day. 

I'd like to give a MAJOR THANK YOU to /u/traceyh415 , who has gone so far out of her way both physically, mentally, and I'm sure financially, to help people stay safe for free as they use all over this wonderful, green earth. I can only imagine how many lives her actions have saved.

This subreddit is capable of doing a lot of great things for the addiction community and has definitely done so, but I don't feel right in participating in something anymore that I feel plays a part in the glorification of a lot of people's heroin usage, as I know that it definitely did that for me. It helped me as well, don't get me wrong, but I'm clean from opiates now and have been for a long enough time that at this point, all this subreddit could do is harm me. 

Stay black ya'll,

I went through a rough patch and got myself physically dependent on H, for about 2 months. This is the first time I've been dependent on an opiate. 
I tried the cold turkey kick and successfully got through the 5 days but found that the compulsive voice in my head telling me to use was so strong that I couldn't help going back. 
So I went to the Dr here in Aus and he's put me on 8mg suboxone daily. I've been on the bupe for almost 2 weeks. 
I'm finding myself feeling very flat, and irritable, and almost robot like. I think it might be from the bupe. I asked the doctor about a taper schedule and he seemed not at all interested in ever getting me off the suboxone, and he mentioned a taper schedule would look something like cutting down to 2mg and then jumping off, 'because you cant cut the film up'.
From what I've read on the internet this would still result in quite heavy withdrawal symptoms.
I've recently been given the freedom of 3 takeaways per week from the pharmacy and was wondering if anyone here had any experience with only taking subs every second day? Do you find you start to get sick towards the end of the 48 hrs? 

I was thinking if I could do 8mg every second day that might be equivalent to doing 4mg a day due to the long half life of the bupe.

That way I'd have a small stockpile of missed takeaway doses at home that I could cut up into 1mg / 0.5mg etc when I do a taper. 

Hopefully in a few more weeks I'll be granted more takeaways and could start to do my own taper plan.

So sick of Drs here just putting me on medication and then refusing to help me taper off it when I ask for it. I had the same thing with 2 different Drs and 2 different anti-depressants and everytime I have to sort out my own reasonable taper plan at home :/ ",1472705175.0

Acquired from plastic surgery complications. I was so desperate for any way to be happy, I thought being not-ugly was the only way that was feasible - because society told me opiates turn me into a miserable hobo. Research has shown me that the risks were so overstated. I had a passive income and no social circle to disappoint. I should have dove right in.

Happiness is such a big deal. There's nothing worse than a life without happiness, nothing. Even a life filled with 90% pain and 10% happiness is better, that's just how humans are wired. We are genetically predisposed to seek happiness over avoiding pain, otherwise our species would not have reached the heights it has. 

You guys get to be more chemically happy than the great heroes of the ancient world did on the eve of their greatest achievements. Happier than Michael Phelps when he won 8 gold medals. On the daily, whenever you want (at least when you can afford it). Just appreciate how cool that is... and maybe think about sharing the knowledge with those who could benefit. There should be opiate evangelists in /r/foreveralone so people on the edge can actually try opiates and be able to at least make an informed choice for their lives, not just trust what society tells them about drugs. 

Edit: To be clear, I am not using opiates. I've tried and they have no effect on me due to the brain damage. Hence the envy.

my slips were, after 3 months clean snorted some heroin but it was a one time thing

about 4 months later i smoked some weed with a friend, then a roommate came out with dope and a syringe so i shot some dope. which was once again a one time thing.

now anyway, those are my slip ups, some background i went to a rehab facility for 3 months and then lived in a halfway house for about 5 months. i am now finally back home living with my family

during my time in rehab an halfway houses they pushed the 12 steps on me and shoved it down my throat, i opposed it for a month but then i gave in and tried it, i found a sponsor with years of sobriety under his belt and i put my all into working these steps with him, but after finishing these steps, righting my wrongs through them, trying to correct character defects through the program, ive realized that nothing is working.

its been 8 months and i still wake up every morning like its the first day i quit. i crave dope like no other, all i want to feel is that warm opiate embrace. ive talked to people in the program and they tell me to pray about it, my therapist tells me to go to more NA meetings which i go to 3 a day if i can an my psych thinks its my meds fault even though my meds calm down most of my conditions. 

im getting a new therapist tomorrow who soley only takes bad opiate addicts according to my family. my family and i are currently exploring other options of treatment for me to help. 

the topic of discussion right now is getting me on suboxone at least for awhile but i dont think id be able to get on suboxone since ive been clean for so long. does anyone have any alternative treatments other than the 12 steps? would i need to relapse to be able to get suboxone? cause if something doesnt change soon im gonna have a needle in my arm very soon. ive been stuck in obsessive thoughts and nothing is helping me, everything my sponsor says doesnt help, my family isnt helping the cravings, doing things to keep my mind busy isnt helping an im going insane.

ive been pacing the house chain smoking newports all day just trying to do something to get my mind right but all that happens is me plotting on how to go pick up some dope. i really need help and i think suboxone would help the most because it keeps my opiate receptors happy to keep cravings at bay and it would prevent me from shooting heroin. 

i just really need help guys, im at the point of tears because i dont know what to do anymore. staying abstinent from everything isnt working, ive been having these thoughts for months. i just wanna shoot some dope. i hate it. i cant take it anymore. i just wanna use,,,",1472686515.0

Same batch/shit outta what I had done previously and doing even more.. the very next day when i'm in a better mood overall the same dose I did day before same exact dope I had put up will get me high as a kite and in a great fuckin' mood lovin everything. It's just weird to me just HOW much my mood effects how high I get. Is it the same for everyone or am I just some freak anomaly? 1-2yrs with blues 2 yrs+ doin dope everyday and i've had days like this outta no where maybe every few weeks or so

Is it because of the popularity of painkillers, which still seem to be pretty widely available, despite the crackdown on pill mills? I understand that the Port of Miami inspects more cans in anticipation of drug trafficking, but then why is coke so popular/inexpensive? East coast coke *and* dope both move mostly through DR (and to an extent, Puerto Rico), and Florida certainly has a healthy opiate scene that's saturated with addicts .. Why doesn't the dope follow the coke? More than once, I've heard of dealers (or their mules) driving down from *Philly* for their dope, and I can't think of any reason why .. Does cocaine just have such a monstrously bigger scene there that dealers simply write off the loads that are seized (but then why not also traffic heroin) ? Somebody please help me.

My town's been disgustingly dry lately, and though I typically prefer my blues and/or Opanas, I must say I am beyond pleasantly surprised to have found a plug that seems to carry these semi-regularly. 

Anyone seen these around lately, or mess with them frequently at all? Not quite sure how 'rare' these 200mg ovals are, but these are legitimately the only pharmaceutical opiate I had yet to experience at least once, even being from a smaller town.

If you're currently clean, do the same to remind yourself that you've made it this far and the potential consequences of going back are not worth risking the fleeting yet unpredictable brilliance that life has to offer.

A bit drab of an outlook, but I think it's an important outlook to carry when still actively using. Being ""aware"" doesn't just mean remembering those who we've lost, it means remembering that *we* are still alive. Everybody in this world (at least everyone on this sub, I'm sure) has someone that cares about them. Whose world would be shattered if you suddenly weren't in it. That doesn't mean you ""owe"" them a miserable, clean existence on this earth, it just means that you make their life better.

He says at 3pm his delivery will be in for sure. Fuck. 3 more hours? I'm screaming in my head. Thinking so hard how I'm going to get through the next 3 hours even though it's not really a long time, but when your sick and expected to have stuff 2 hours prior it makes you a tad crazy. 

So me and my dboy/boss are sitting in his driveway bullshittin, and he says so how we gonna get you feeling well till 3? I say idk man I'm screwed got no money on me, and the other people I can call aren't around now...fuck. So he makes a call or two and next thing I know we're at an ATM he's taking money out and then driving to another dboys place so he can buy me a 40 to hold me over. Who does that???? Dude spent his own money just to help me get well till his stuff was ready to be picked up. This dude is a blessing. Never had a dealer that gave a shit about me in anyway at all let alone go out of their way to buy me a couple points to hold me over. Back in NY my dboy woulda just said tough shit, wait till 3. This is southern hospitality at its finest.

He did this yesterday too, bought me a 40 when we found out his plug wouldn't be liquid till today. So over two days he's been dry he spent $80 of his own money to keep me well till he would be good again. Granted we work together and he wants me able to work, and I sell a lot of H for him during the workday. I never expected him to come out of pocket like that, at all. He's a good dude for real, doesn't expect anything in return except my friendship which is s rare quality in humans these days especially in this scene. 

Anyway just felt like sharing while I wait now for 3pm to roll around. Feeling normal again, no more sweating and restless legs thankfully.

Why the fuck can't it be the same with opiates? WHY? Why can't I just say, ""You know what, I wanna feel good today."" and leave it at that one time, like I have done with every single other drug ever?

Why do you think opiates in particular have so much power? Or do you think it's particular to the user (I mean there are crack/meth/coke addicts too)? 

Just curious... For me, I think opiates are so hard for me to stay away from because I've always had some issues with depression and a problem accepting life as it is. I always want more- more adventure, more experiences, whatever. Not just filling my life up with work and hoping I can save enough to take a vacation once or twice a year... Opiates took away these issues. They made me content with the day to day. Of course eventually they just brought more problems, really only due to lack of being able to afford them, though. Spending all of your money on drugs of course is gonna have huge implications, and running out and having to go through w/d is gonna have impacts too.

So I have a pretty decent habit. I try to keep it to .5g> a day but if I indulge I can easily put 2g's up my nose. So I am currently on a trip with my family in a popular city in Greece. I tried to taper prior to the trip but I didn't really get as clean as I wanted. Well I brought a little less than a g of ECP with me on the trip. I know, stupid idea but I was confident there was no way they could find it even if a dog hit on my bag. Anyways, I thought I would be able to spread that out over 10 days and by day 2 I quickly realize there was no way to make that happen. I get on Reddit and searched ""(city I'm in) Heroin"" and come to find out this place is chalk full of it. As my parents sleep off the jet lag I take to the streets to try to find me some #3. 
     It's 9:30am local time and I start wandering up and down the alleyways and streets. After walking past a few homeless people nodding out I knew it was only a matter of time before I found somebody who knew what was up. These first homeless people I encountered did not seem like they would speak English or be very friendly so I kept going. After 45mins or so I saw 2 white homeless people in a doorway. I made a b-line at them and asked if they spoke English. They were from the U.K. and seemed friendly enough. I asked if they knew where to get...and he cut me off and said ""weed?"" I laughed and said, ""No I was actually looking for H."" The 2 homeless guys looked decently surprised as I don't look the part of a junkie. It was still early in the morning so he says, ""come back in an hour and a half, I don't use but I know where to take you."" I asked several times if we could just go now, but he insisted on waiting.
       So I walk around killing time for an hour and a half before going back. He was ready to roll and explained the prices and product. It's 10 Euro for a rock. He asked how I used. I indicated snorting and he said good. With this form of H you need to mix lemon juice (citric acid) with it in order to IV. We kept walking towards the dodgy part of town. He was a super friendly guy and we talked about all sorts of stuff while we found the spot. We walked past an incredible amount of homeless people on the way, which he said 9/10 were junkies or dealers. We first try the Albanian neighborhood which was a 20-30 minute walk from where we were. When we get to the spot he said to keep walking and sit on a bench a little ways away. I handed him 80 Euro and said there would be 10 in it for him after. He came back in 2 minutes and said no luck, the guy didn't remember him and didn't want to sell. Shit.
          My new friend said we wouldn't go back until we scored, and I agreed. He said we would go to the Nigerian neighborhood and try a gang of guys he knows there. Another 10 minute walk and he says, ""when we get to that group of black guys keep walking."" So I walked past and hung out on the next street corner. 30 seconds later he walked by and indicated we were good. Excited and relieved, I asked if they had it on hand ready to go. He explained the dealers keep the baggies in their mouths and just spit out the little pellets. I saw the product and it was 8 perfectly spherical plastic wrapped pellets. We walked back to the tourist section of the city and we parted ways. As soon as I got back to the room I emptied a baggy and was surprised to see an off-white powder. Everything I read said the H they have in Greece is a brown, rocky substance. I shrugged and cut up a line and straight up my nose. A wave of comfort and poppy bliss rolled over and I knew it was solid product. I've only ever done this sort of thing once before and it went well, but I know it's asking for trouble. But right now I'm sitting by the pool enjoying the euphoric effects of Grecian #3 dope. Hope everyone out there is having a good Friday and found this somewhat interesting.

Another one of my friends warned me about my guy's quantity. I was in a rush and needed to pick up. Another connect said they could get but that it might be a while... Couldn't wait so ended up going to my guy. The first tip off should of been the price. Usually my guy charges 40 a point. He was willing to let it go for 30 a point.

Fast forward 2 hours, got my shit. There was barely any smell to it. It didn't smell like anything until you cook it. Thought ""Shit this might be fent, I should probably only do a half""... Blast it, didn't feel much... But it crept up on me.. Decided to blast another half. Felt a little bit more, but not much... 

Usually I can do a half point to a full to get pretty lit. Well all said and done, I did a point and a half... I feel pretty domed right now, but I don't know if that has more to do with the hydroxyzine I took after the first shot didn't do much.

I wish I would have gone through my other connect. They said they did a half and were good, and usually this person does a point, point and a half in a shot.

Is it fiction? Is it nonfiction? Is it a biography? Is it an autobiography? Is it fantasy? Is it science fiction? Is it a series of books, or a specific book in a series? Is it a standalone novel? Is it a play (yes they count)? Is it a piece of Gonzo journalism? Is it a short story, or collection of them? Of course, tell us why. 

Sorry for all these random days I miss, life gets in the way, but I do my best. Hope you're all doing well (and staying well), excited to hear your opinions here. Happy Nodding (and reading)! ",1472878864.0

I wasnât there.

Cancer ravaged your body quickly like a vulture feasting on a corpse,

I never got to say goodbye.

I was too busy getting high.

When your condition worsened I missed visits,

skipped visits, how I wish I could turn back time,

oh mommy how I wish you could come home.

Okay, well, I've never encountered that in 5 years of IV. Except.. perhaps today. So, I've had an 'ole faithful in my hand between my thumb and wrist that I've been using this week. The skin/muscle area under the skin started to get tougher and harder every day, until it feels like there is something solid under there, I'm sure its just bruising or swelling. There's no pain or discolouration. But, I went to hit it today, and without injecting anything OH MY GOD, it felt like FIRE there at the end of the needle. I pulled out and 10 seconds later the pain subsided, I won't be going there again because that was so intense, almost/equal to an artery hit. But - without injecting anything, I didn't even try and register - the area went white and swelled up like a histamine reaction. Every other site down my arm I had hit this week also came up in a bump, then most of my arm was swollen and areas were white as the blood was pushed out from under the skin because of pressure. It looked like a regular histamine reaction x 1000.
  
So.. um, nerve cluster? What exactly is a nerve cluster? Like a point where all the nerve up and down a limb collect in one point? Do they need a lot of blood to survive, hence why it was near a great thick blood tube? I would have thought they'd be deeper or somewhere more significant than a thumb!",1472994042.0

I was asking anyone I remotely thought would have access to something, still no luck. Went into work at 6pm and was feeling horrid, then I realized I should ask one of my co workers who wasn't at work today, because I know he sells weed. I got his number and his cousin had 9 10mg vicodin, so I asks how much he wants for them, as they usually go for 5 or 6 by me. He responds with ""10 for all 9"", I thought that was a typo and that he wanted 100$ for all 9 which is a super steep price. Luckily he's a good guy and didn't raise the price as it wasn't a typo, 10$ for 9 vhydro 10 mg os a hell of a deal, I told him ill give him twenty. So he comes to my workplace and drops them off to me, I ended up taking all 9 over the rest of my shift till like 2 am, and I'm feeling pretty great right now, and this is the first time I ever got high off vicodin as when I was using I started off with oxys and went to heroin. Junkie Jesus was looking out for me, I would have been screwed without those. How's everyone else's day been? ",1472979085.0

My question is when I inject into my cheeks, Am I supposed to press hard on the needle so it goes into the muscle, or do I just have to have the needle all the way in, but not put any pressure? See I don't know if I'm injecting into the fat, or the actual muscle. No one has explained this too me!

I told him I'd get him one for getting them, so he went and got them while I grabbed a case of Yuengling at the store. When he got back with the blues he had a friend with him who was really cool and had brought some really good fishscale with him, then the new friend took an oxy 15 and crushed it up and mixed it in with the coke and made up four fat ass rails for the 4 of us, (me, my girl, Joe, and his friend) then the friend had to leave cuz he's got a 3-month-old baby to take care of at home. We were just chilling at my apartment drinking beers and shooting the shit when one of my best friends, James, who doesn't do any drugs or even knows about me and my girl's use, hits us up to tell us he's at the strip club across the street from my place for his friend's bachelor party so I'm like hell yeah, we're coming over there! But first we had to run and get some more coke down the street from this guy at another bar. So an hour later we're back at my place with the coke and we break out a few more fat rails and head over to the strip club, it's BYOB so we get more beer and take some of it with us. We're throwing money around at the club, having a blast, I almost get in a fight with this dumb drunk guy but the bouncer grabbed him and ripped his shirt and kicked him out haha. After we left the strip club the three of us (me, Joe and my gf) go back to our place and do a lot more coke and drink a lot more beer, and she and I do the rest of our pills. At this point we've done 2.5 oxy 30's each, drank 15-20 beers apiece and who knows how much coke. A lot. Everybody is wide awake talking their fucking asses off, smoking mad cigarettes and just having a great time hanging out. This is something we've done a lot of. At about 6 am, my buddy passes out on our couch and she and I head to bed. I put a movie on Netflix to pass out to and pretty soon we're both out. 

A little while later, I'm half asleep trying to cuddle with her and she's not hugging me back or responding to my body language at all. I start noticing her breathing is irregular and she's taking quick, quiet breaths in like gasping and no breaths out. At this point I get scared and start shaking her to wake her up and she's not waking up at all, not breathing and turning blue. I start tapping her on the side of her face going ""wake up, wake up, wake up. Hey! Hey! What's going on? wake up!"" No response. I lift up on her eyelids to see her eyes and they're rolled back in her head. She needs oxygen so I tilt her head back, open her mouth and start giving her mouth to mouth. After blowing air into her mouth for what seemed like 3 minutes she finally opens her eyes really wide and looks right at me and takes a deep breath in and sits up. I give her a big hug but she's still not OK. She can't talk and she starts taking really shallow quick breaths and is shivering so bad her teeth are chattering. I make her stand up and drink water and she's really weak and can barely stand so I hold her up and make her walk around the room with her arm over my shoulders. I put clothes on her and tell her I need to take her to the ER but she musters up a ""No!"" So I say if she doesn't get better we have to go. I walk her outside past my passed out friend on the couch and we take a walk around the parking lot outside. For the next 20 minutes, her breathing is still really shallow but she's hyperventilating and shivering so bad that at one point she bit her tongue super hard and made it bleed. Finally, after all that walking I notice her breathing slowly start to go back to normal and she tells me she feels better but she's really tired and weak feeling. I tell her she can't go to sleep and I need to keep an eye on her for the next couple hours so she throws up outside and tells me she's hungry so we go to McDonald's and grab some breakfast. She's really scared and confused and I tell her she OD'ed and slipped unconscious and we're so lucky I woke up and realized what was going on. We're still really shook up but we decided today we're going to do a taper and quit this shit for good because I can't bear to lose my best friend and that was too close of a call! Anyways thanks for reading and sorry for the wall of text, I just can't tell anybody I know about this and needed to share with somebody.

So I was doing a job replacing 2 AC units at my house. So me and my boss finished the job, and we were waiting for his buddy to drop off frion cause we ran out. So my stupid moronic ass decided to do a shot while we waited. But instead of being smart and doing it in the comfort and privacy of my own room or bathroom, I decided to do it in the work truck in my driveway.

So I'm out there and I'm mixing my shot up and my boss says don't worry buddy I got my eyes peeled for ya. Cool. So I should be good I'm almost finished anyway. Next thing I know my moms walking outside and my boss says put it away buddy your mom! Your mom! So I get it down quick enough and hide it all, but turns out my dad decided to look out the upstairs window and somehow was at a perfect angle to see just the passenger side of the truck. I was bent over sitting down where I thought no one could so, but I guess I was wrong.

So my mom says come inside right now! I say what why?!? And she says you know why come in right now!! And I open the door and step out while saying idk what your trying to say here, and boom my cap of the rig was on my lap and it fell off my lap right by my moms foot as I got out. Fucked. Great. Dunzo. Worst part was they saw me doing this while I was sitting next to my boss. So now they're skeptical as fuck. 

So now I'm standing in my kitchen wit my folks, and my boss and their just talking about another job we need done, and writing out the cheque. As soon as he leaves, I'm sure I'm in for some bitching about it all. I was so good, months now they've thought I was sober. All ruined cause of one stupid ass move on my part. Fml. 

I mean shit, I'm 27. I work everyday. I don't ask my parents for shit. Hell they owe me $24,000 that I lent them over a year ago when they were hurting.

But for the sake of posterity and literary mirth let me explain my position:
I used to live in New York and shoot 3-5 bundles of dope a day, with my habit at this point for the better part of a year. I moved when my life began crumbling and finances could not bolster such a habit, to live with my family and attend university while beside them. I began a 16 mg. suboxone dose (the only dose post-titration where I wasn't not still feeling WD's -- I don't need people telling me my dose is too high). 
I continued to abuse heroin, sometimes cheating my subs, sometimes using on subs and just using enough to break past them. I now have a few gram habit, and while I don't use daily I do use 1-3 times a week. Usually up to five grams of dope (and some hard or soft alongside if I can muster the funds) per relapse. 
At this point I have lost so many friends, love, and the trust of my family due to this insidious lifestyle. While a switch to methadone won't solve the entire problem, it may certainly help. Suboxone simply isn't working for me, not taking away my cravings, and I still feel withdrawals on them after using. I think that having to take the methadone at clinic every morning + having a full agonist like methadone will help. I think it's what I need.
Anyone else do this and have it work for them? Again, I am not looking for someone to tell me to stick it out with the subs, get off the subs, etc etc. And I'll have you know I do go to meetings (IOP), work a program (meeting with a psych/therapist weekly), and go to DBT. I am well-researched in the full-spectrum approach regarding this matter.

I really want to sleep, and I know the whole ""you probably shouldn't for  the possibility of relapse etc etc"", but if I take one or two hydrocodone will it make the withdrawal last even longer or will it get bad again? Or will it do anything to mess up the withdrawal at all? I just need some sleep. Please help!",1472918724.0

Long time reader, first time OP post (in this sub). So I've been IVing drugs since before dope. About 10 years. I know my safety / harm reduction. I FINALLY managed to stop using H and got on Subs. A few days in I started shooting them  (save time, taste, better fx, fixation etc.) and now I'm struggling to stop it. I know it's psychological and I'm as safe as can be. It's always a clear solution (or as close to clear ad possible) going in.

 Does anyone else have experience with this? Does anyone know what dangers there are with this (aside from obvious IV related dangers), based on facts or direct experience? I can't find anything much online. My eventual goal is abstinence and I know I'm just reinforcing my fixation / ritualistic behaviour. But am I in any physical danger? Can this have some side effect I'm not aware of? The experience and brotherhood in this sub have been invaluable to me over the years so thank you to all of you.

We have all been there, either getting in our car or filling up the tank at the gas station. Meanwhile, someone will approach you with a long story ""my car broke down and I'm 60 miles from home"" or something along those lines. ""All I need is x amount of dollars and I can fix it or fill up the tank. The other night I even had a guy try to sell a phone so he could buy a water pump at 1 am.

Tonight was different. I was leaving the gas station with some grub I bought with my last bit of money, and this car pulls up next to me. He motioned for me to roll down my window, and I oblige. He points to his back seat and says ""look man I got my family with me, and my girl has been out of work for mont-"" I interrupt, ""dude sorry I don't have any cash.""

Today wasn't one of my finer monents. I relapsed and I'm so disgusted with myself. I'm even more disgusted because I told these 3 highschoolers I'd get them weed and ripped them off for $40.

So I know this kid who's 3 years younger than me. He's still in highschool and always hits me up asking for weed or acid. I'm sorry bro I don't have the time every day to go out of my way to get you drugs. I'm in the middle of butt-fuck egypt and this guy expects me to figuratively fly to fucking the artic circle to get him drugs every.fucking.day. I got projects bro. So I decided to rip him off.

The problem with highschoolers is that they don't have cars. Fuck man that shits so gay. So I pick up this kid and his friend and tell them were going to get mango tea from the store. We get in the store after they gave me their money. I said I forgot my wallet and had to get it from my car and that I'll be right back. They followed me outside so my plan of driving off like that was foiled. So I devised this STUPID fucking plan. I went to the dispensary and then sat there while waiting to pick up a dub from my friend.....Fuck you said you'd never do it again. Well I fucked up for sure. 2 and a half weeks down the drain :(. Once I got the dub I told them I was in this white truck in the back of the parking lot. 

So one of them goes over there and the other sat at my car. So I ran to my car and unlocked my door got in a drove away. The kid was just sitting there banging on my car window. God so sketchy. I feel horrible now. I shouldn't have fucking done that. Well all I can do is move on.

The one where the poster saw that ad on CL, and was clearly desperate enough to consider trying it. Everyone obviously mentioned how bad of an idea it was, yet few gave any real advice on what to do instead, other than just vague guidelines to 'cold cop' instead. 

My post, while rambly and messy, contained a lot of good tricks and tips on cold copping from various stories and sources I've heard from. Also what to look out for, what's a good idea and what's not, plus a ton of harm reduction info and repeated warnings. So I feel like my info wasn't wasted, I'm going to post it here. It's long so half will be here and half in the comments. If anyone finds it just a rambly, stupid mess that isn't worthy of being posted, that's fine... but I figure if even one person can get one good thing out of it, then it was worth it. The next paragraph is the beginning of the post:

**Part 1:** Since this is in broken english, and lists a ton of  various drugs and other illegal items for sale, I'd bet my life on it being a scam from africa. 

**But I'm genuinely curious about what the sentence in the ad: ""-Will not give any Prescription to go in your car and return."" means**Been racking my brain trying to think of what it could mean and came up with a bunch of stuff, but none really make sense. It seems it could be a language barrier thing or translation error... which would further increase the likelihood of the ad being a scam.

**PLEASE OP, DON'T RISK THIS. COLD COP IF YOU MUST, OR USE THE DNM (DARK NET MARKET) OR OTHER OPTIONS BEFORE YOU TRY THIS.** 

Legit drug ads on CL usually never have blatant drug names in the title. They'll say like 'Roofing Tar' or 'Roxy shorts size 30' or some similar shit. When people have dealt with ads like that in the past, they've usually had luck, but beware of them in general, since sketchy shit can occur and you don't wanna get fucked over out of more than just money/time. 

I'd doubt cops would make ads trying to bust just users, but some lazy, worthless, piece of shit scum pigs who're bored, trying to make their quotas, and trying to 'catch the low hanging fruit' so to speak (a.k.a. anyone dumb enough to fall for that) could potentially be behind at least some ads. 

Cold copping, CL, DNM, or 'other options'... regardless of what you proceed with, be cautious at all times, never let money walk, and be on guard at all times. If your gut instinct is telling you to back out ASAP, then do so. Getting a fix isn't worth an arrest, being raped or beaten/mugged, or sold a drug you dont' want, that might make u OD or have a bad experience (esp. if you're in withdrawal, which you'd probably be)... and worthless 'human' trash assholes take advantages of those who're desperate for a fix and in withdrawals, since it's often obvious. They'll often try to act as nice as possible, and that they'll get you feelin better asap... jus to end up fucking you over someway.

Those 'other options' include going on backpage.com (or .net or whatever , just google), searching for 'escorts' in your area, and, since a lot of them use, or got friends that use,  they're  a good way to get dope. Hit one of them up, say you're not interested in sex, but were looking to get some dope. If you do I'll buy you a bag. If it's good I'll buy some more even. Something like that should be said. I've heard more good experiences with that route that bad ones. Same goes with strip clubs. Going up to a girl, throwin her some money at first, and asking if she can get dope. 

Then when she has a chance like a break or w/e, you guys go score, and you get them a bag for doing it. Obviously try to get these people's connect's if possible (like if you meet them, e.g. you're all in the same car, you could say ur a friend of <stripper or escort>, could i grab ur number? but some dealers legit like don't want new customers, and if you're told that by someone who got shit for you if you asked for their number or to meet them, it doesn't necessarily mean they're lying and  wanna keep the connect for themselves so they're guaranteed a cut if u buy... but sometimes it's just that. And I can't really blame em. Plus it takes a lot of the legal risk off of you. Hell the only time I had a drug charge in court was cuz I was middling and holding the dude's dope. But I didn't care since I understood the risks, and that's why I was getting paid in dope mainly, for taking that risk... and because I had the connect lol).

So yeah, in conclusion, and as others have said... DO NOT DO THIS! There are far better, less riskier, and more likely ways to  cop some dope/pills/whatever. But the general rule is only bring out like $10-$20 and nothing more. no valuables. maybe a cheap burner phone but not a smartphone just to be safe. not even your wallet. So yeah be safe if you try any of these suggestions. and keep in mind that I have no experience with them. I only 'sorta' cold copped, although my 'friend' at the time did all the work and we got skimped (but at least it was real lol). I never used backpage and hit up a escort looking for dope, and I never went to a strip club to ask.

If I were you, I'd give a panhandler or someone obviously high a proposition that if they bring you to their dealer (preferably for an introduction to them, but if they just middle it'd be alright too), and everything goes well, you'll take care of them (buy them a bag of their drug of choice, maybe give em some cigs and a few bucks too if they really helped you out and were really sincere and honest, as well as kind in general, and not like 'crazy', you know? Anyway, be safe especially with shit you haven't done before, and when doing it in a place you've never been before ('environmental tolerance' is a real thing, surprisingly). ALWAYS do test shots, since you can always do more but can never do less (without narcan ruining your high, and waiting out 30-45 mins of precipitated withdrawals until you can use again... provided you still have more and no scumbag pigs/paramedics 

took it, or your 'friends' didn't loot your dying body... god I hate people like that so much >:(

Sorry for this long winded novel of a post haha. Just wanted to share some helpful info on various tips for cold copping, and obtaining shit via unconventional channels (like the darknet market for example. I won't explain that here, check out /r/darknetmarketnoobs). 

Best of luck with copping! And never let desperation make you do something that'll fuck you over in the end. I know it's hard when like someone's claiming they can get shit quickly and you needed that shit YESTERDAY haha... but they just need to run around the corner to their dealer for a sec, or in a building... and they never come back, or they leave thru the back exit and aren't seen again. Never let money walk if it can be avoided (I'm pretty sure I said that but it bears repeating. Only in very rare, certain situations, should money be allowed to walk, and even then, always with collateral that's of equal or greater of value to the money you let walk. If they offer jewlery for you to hold, unless you're a good appraiser and have tools with you, you can never really know if it's real and what it's worth, so don't allow that. Same goes for credit/debit cards. Most likely have a $0 balance or are flagged stolen or suspicious by the bank or are overdrawn. Same goes for any type of cards and shit. 

And btw if they let you hold onto a smartphone, be weary of that too. It could be broken or stolen and isn't their's... so they'll take off with your money, get high, since they couldn't get into the phone or sell it. And if the true owner of the phone is using the GPS to track it currently, you could be standing there, waiting for the middle to return, when the phone's owner (often with the police) are arresting you for either robbery, larceny, or receiving stolen property. Smartphones nowadays aren't worth stealing unless you have a connect who'll buy them, knowing they're hot, and can like 'hack' them to make them work, with a brand new IMEI number, so they're not blacklisted, and won't be illegal to be caught with... or they'll just disassemble it and sell off the parts for a profit. 

Just another thing I thought of since I've heard of a similar situation happening... (Middle can't bring others with her to cop [although i had a dealer like that before so it *is* a legit thing], but some compromise and /or deal needs to be made in advance, like u need to be within view of them, but not be able to be seen by their dealer, or if in a car, and they get in a car, follow them but not making it obvious.) But I'd say the MOST IMPORTANT part of cold copping this way (finding someone who'll cop for you but can't introduce you to their dealer, is judging their character. It can be pretty easy to tell who's more likely to just ditch you and keep the money/dope, and who's genuine, and will return, content with the bag you bought him, and happy to help someone else out. I was always like that, but the dope game has probably more scumbaggy people than it does nice ones like me and a lot on this forum (but even on this forum, there's been reports of scumbaggy behavior, which is 95% denied of course, since people hate admitting to anyone else, let alone themselves even, that they're a scumbag thief. They do these insane 'mental gymnastics' to make it seem to themselves like *they* somehow were in the right, and the person they beat was somehow either deserving of it, or was in the wrong somehow.

They end up believing their own lies often since in the junkie lifestyle, no matter if you're on the street or have a 100+k a year job and are functioning well and no one knows mainly... you still gotta lie, a LOT. Like way more than the average amount of lies normies tell daily. It's sad that prohibition/stigma makes it this way, but it's all about survival. And often we become so good at lying that we can concoct a great story on the spot that's so believable to others, yet it's 1000% false. It's so believable to others that we end up, sometimes even inadvertently, believing our own lies. Sometimes as a defense mechanism to console ourselves, and/or so it's easier to remember what the lie is if it needs to be repeated. The latter I can understand of course, and I was guilty of that as well in the past. But I only lied to my parents/family, because the truth means that using would be way more difficult, and that I'd get no money ever, and get bitched at for a while, etc. But I'd never lie to a fellow user, except for little white lies to get me out of a situation, like 'sorry this is my last cig/i just bummed this'... or if I'm in a sketchy situation and wanna leave, ill look at my phone, or watch, look surprised and say 'fuck, i totally forgot, i gotta go home asap i had to do this, or there's a family emergency, etc... ill hit u guys up later, sorry about that.'

My habit is about a gram a day of bth. I've been holding on to the subutex for just over a year now. Does anyone know if they'll go bad in this time? I've read official release documents on suboxone and it appears they passed IHC guidelines for storage stability to a point point that they were eligible to be retested for stability after 52wks that to me says they should be fine. Anyway I'm wondering if anyone can advise me on how to best taper. I'm trying to avoid building any kind of dependence on the subs to we're I could possibly WD from those as well. Would it be easier to start the transition with the subutex first to avoid precipitated WD?  Although I've always heard the naloxone plays little if any role in precipitated WD.

Within the past 3 years I've done oxycodone 5-6 times, hydrocodone 5-6 times, codeine once, tramadol once.

Anyways I just got prescribed hydrocodone 7.5/375 a few days ago because of surgery and i'm in absolutely ZERO pain so I've been abusing them a bit this week, done em 3 times since I got them prescribed 5 days ago. I want to get 1 more high out of them but just need to know what dose I should do to feel good considering my tolerance...

1st day I did 22.5mg with 25mg DPH and 3 glasses of grapefruit juice.

2nd day (the next day) I did 30mg with 25mg DPH, it felt just as strong as the 22.5mg the previous day.

3rd day I didn't do anything.

4th day I did 45mg with 25mg DPH and a glass of grapefruit juice, it was a bit stronger than the last 2 doses but didn't feel like the whole 45mg.

5th day (yesterday) I didn't do any, so now today is day 6 and i'm wondering how much I should do to feel good. I want the dose to feel like I did 30-40mg with no tolerance but how much should I do considering iv'e done 20-45mg 3 times this past week? Btw I always do cold water extractions & got about 100mg hydrocodone left.

PM me if you're interested. Right now I have enough to send 5 packages, but I may be able to send out more depending on how many people can pay for their own. **If you can't afford your own postage, don't worry! I can still send them, thanks to a donation from an awesome person (/u/huffinit) and my own funds.**

Just PM me your name and address and whether you want just narcan or rigs too. And whether you can pay for shipping or not. **Either way I will send them to you.** If just narcan I can send it out Tuesday but I won't have rigs until Wednesday. 

I'll take this down when I run out.

I started the methadone clinic about a month ago. Got up to 60mgs/day. Never stopped shooting dope on top of it, so 60mgs of done a day + ~.5 of pretty fire ecp. I got myself into a shitty little hole mentally, I was suicidal just wanting to die constantly even though I was never sick thanks to the done. I was just miserable. I asked my family for help, again, picked up and moved to a tiny lil mountain town in another state with my moms sister to be with her family, my cousins and their families, and my grandma. I moved on sunday. I took 120mgs of done around 7am sunday morning and did my last shot. Havent had anything since. The original plan was to transfer to a clinic here, continue on methadone, and just get off the dope. Well that got shot to hell...there are no methadone clinics within 100+ miles of where I am. So the plan was to go to the sub clinic my cousin and his gf attend and have been successful at for almost a year now. I knew I wouldn't be able to cold turkey methadone withdrawals. 

But the point im getting too (not so quickly) is I am not sick hardly at all. Like 2 days later now, and the worst ive suffered is a lot of bullshit sweating last night and achey body. I literally feel fine other than that. So I'm sitting here thinking, if this is as ""sick"" as im gonna get then I dont need fuckin suboxone. Honestly even if get a good bit sicker than this I can still probably handle it and would probably rather do it cold turkey. I guess my question is are the horrible, worst ever methadone withdrawals coming? Has it just not been long enough? I figured 2 days in and i would be sick as a dog if I wasn't induced onto subs yet. Also makes me wary to take any subs for fear of pwd.

I'd like to ask these questions to hopefully learn what does, and certainly doesn't.

First for the sober people:

* 1) Length of sobriety, drug(s) of choice -- Oh, and did you take any maintenance drugs to get there? (or currently are)
* 2) What do you think helped *you* get this far? We've seen people with everything give it all up never to 
bother to regain it. Willpower and motivation are not enough on their own.
* 3) Any relapses? Did you learn anything from them?


For people who are using:

* 1) Drug(s) of choice, amount of time actively using heavily.
* 2) What stops you from stopping now? If you had no w/d's and only had to deal with PAWS what do you think would keep on bringing you back?
* 3) Any meaningful periods of sobriety?  What happened?

Thanks for your answers.  I'm compiling a list that I hope to build some research from so far from my personal interviews it seems to come down these commonalities: family, job, and good friends -- but that's hardly enough.",1473138887.0

My parents found out I was using H, sent me to rehab, and I was clean for a year after. Recently my mom was diagnosed with terminal cancer and deteriorated very quickly she's now palliative. I relapsed and my family knows but was brushing it under the rug and pretending I was clean so my mom wouldn't have the stress of my drug use.

When I was going to visit my mom I couldn't help but snag meds from her. I felt guilty because I know she needs them for pain, but I also couldn't resist the temptation. I stopped visiting her to fix the problem but my dad got on my back about it and insisted I go see my mom.

As per advice of r/relationships I asked my dad to lock up the meds and he refused and told me I was a selfish POS but continued to insist I see my mom. Now when I go to see her my dad is accusatory and stern and I think my mom is cluing in on the tension and will find out about my relapse.

My mom doesn't need the negativity at her current state and I can't get through to my dad. I know he's grieving and I understand his actions but its he's making it worse for everybody. I think I need to stop visiting but I don't know what my dad will tell my mom if I do and he'll probably keep showing up at my door to make me go. Any advice I'm not sure what I should do.

Interested in opinions from mods and everyone,"I don't post much at all here but I'm lurking every single day, largely because this is a really great community which has a lot to offer people of completely different circumstances. 


ATM I'm supporting someone really close to me who is having a *massive* problem with opiates. The story will be familiar to all here: he recognises that they are fucking his life up, but life without opiates is seriously scary for him.


So we've been talking about the options etc and although he hasn't posted he has been getting a lot out of this community, and when people post about what they're going through with withdrawals in particular he gets encouragement from that.


Bear in mind that like a lot of opiate addicts he had a difficult past. His childhood was pretty grim and now he carries a lot of pain around with him. Now he is a lovely guy but he is very gentle and sensitive too.


So far so typical for this sub, would you agree? Obviously we're all different but I know a *lot* of addicts who suffer from pain, mental as well as physical, and it can be hard to find non-judgemental support. That is why this sub is worth its weight in gold IMO. 


Anyway he was browsing the sub when he came across a thread with a petty argument in it. Comments like ""kill yourself man"". Basically he couldn't deal with being attacked like that, he said it put him off making an account and contributing. 


Now I'm all for free speech but when sensitive people don't have anywhere else to find people who understand and care, that sort of comment can be devastating if aimed at you. It may be something that bounces off most people's backs, but not all. Who knows, someone could be told to ""kill yourself"" and do so; I don't reckon that's far fetched at all.

I figured I'd share [this](http://moonbit.co.in/?ref=0579c1333376) here. Its one of the easiest ways I found to get free bitcoins. To be completly honest youre only looking at a buck or two a week if you are on top of it but its super simple. Just claim your BTC ever 5 min and at the end of the week it goes straight to your address. I use mobile and there are no popups, nothing that slows phone down or any of that BS. 


In addition to [MoonBit](http://moonbit.co.in/?ref=0579c1333376) I use BitMaker on android. Same concept click a link every 10-30 min and boom free BTC. I couldnt find a link for BitMaker but if you search playstore it should show up as an orange icon.


Anyone know of any other hastle free ways to acquire free BTC.. faucets.. reviews.. link clicking etc? I choose these two because they have the most reward for least amount of work.

Ok. So this has happened to me in the past and never thought much of it. But now since joining up to this sub, of what feels like thousands upon thousands if doppelgÃ¤ngers of my addict self, I think someone should have an answer for me.

So after I do my shot, while the rush is ringing my bells, some dope will give me this weird ""taste"" of sorts, in the back of my throat. I guess you'd say it's a taste, though its very faint and in the back of my throat only. It's strange. It's rare that it happens, I know that it's from whatever the dope is cut with. It's always different tasting depending on the dope, and the size of my shot. It just happened again after my last shot. 

This dope I'm doing right now has some gross cut in it, it's super bitter tasting, but a completely different taste in my throat during my rush, and I actually have to cook it a bit in a spoon just to draw it up without any of the gross shit in it. Which is very rare for me, I NEVER have to cook my ecp usually. It's really good dope though don't get me wrong, just whatever idiot had it at whatever point decided to use some unorthodox cut and mucked it up big time, it's leaves some gross plaster looking hard mush in my spoon once I'm done drawing up, and my cotton is hard as a rock after 5 minutes. Pretty fucked up that I'm even still shooting it into my veins after seeing that lol. But a junkies gonna junk.

So has anyone else had this weird taste or whatever you wanna call it? Any input would be appreciated! Thanks!",1473126507.0

anyways, after about 4 days of this (in which, like i already stated, i only took one 8mg strip in total) i decided to abort the suboxone. i really do not want to be physically dependent on this substance. 

so i now it has been a little over 3 days since i took suboxone, and the withdrawal symptoms i am experiencing are remarkably mild. when i tried to quit the heroin without subs a couple weeks ago i was incapacitated with anxiety and all the standard physical symptoms. i am very weak when it comes to tolerating withdrawls. 

so is there a chance that i ""withdrew"" from the heroin while i was taking the suboxone for the brief period, but also did not maintain a suboxone program long enough to incur withdrawals from that drug? or is suboxone still in my symptom, and do you think the withdrawals are yet to come for me?

Well I answer the phone the last time to tell him I'm about to turn on the street, and this foreign guy who looks like French Montana cut me off so I honked at him. He then proceeds to get out of his car screaming at me and waving a fucking bat around telling me to get out of the car. I say fuck that and speed off, luckily my dude was on the corner already so I pull up and do the transaction in about 3 seconds and the guy pulls in front of me and does the same shit! I speed off and he continues to follow me, weaving through traffic and driving on the wrong side of the road. This goes on for another few minutes and then I see him get on his phone to call some friends to help him. At this point I say fuck it and call the cops because this isn't going to stop on its own until he either gets pulled over or beats me with his baseball bat. Not even 2 seconds after I dial 911, a car in front of me tries to block me in! This is a different car than the original guy so now I have 2 people chasing me. I remember that on my way over to cop I passed a bunch of police officers that were conducting a bust or something at a house so I head back that way. On my way there, a third car starts fucking chasing me!!! Keep in mind I'm in a major city, on busy roads weaving in and out of traffic going anywhere from 50-80mph. The guy in the blue car stopped next to me at a stop light and told me to gtfo out of the car and fight him. If he didn't have a fucking bat and 4 other people in the other cars I would've done it and gotten it over with. But fuck that I'm not getting beat with a bat and jumped by a bunch of guys all at once. So I told him I'm not fighting him and to leave me the fuck alone. Doesn't listen. So I speed off yet again and thankfully some good Samaritan in a pickup truck saw that I was running so he pulled in front of the car to stop him, but one of the 2 cars still following me managed to get around the truck. So finally a cop pulls me over for driving crazy and I explain what happened, and as I'm doing that one of the cars is driving by! So I point him out to the cop and as I do that he rolls down the window and says ""your dead motherfucker"" and made a hand gesture like slicing my throat. So the cop was cool about it and let's me go and says he will take care of it. IDC if he takes care of it or not I just don't wanna see those fucking crazy people ever again. Sorry for the wall of text. 

TL;DR-crazy guys chased me in cars waving bats, had to call cops to get them away because there was 3 of them and they wouldn't leave me alone",1473095603.0

I have been on and off shooting cocaine and heroin for 6 years.  I always was floored by the rush of IV cocaine, but for some reason never really got hooked by it. Heroin is a different story. However, about 6 months ago, for some reason, the pull of IV cocaine really got me. The combination of both heroin and cocaine in a single shot has really taken me from ""chipping"" to unmanageability VERY fast.  I do not really crave either drug separately, but the combo has now become a mental obsession more intense than anything I thought possible.  

Also, this is the crazy part that I can't stop running through my head.  I had always heard of bell ringers and the train and all that when referring to IV cocaine. I thought I knew what that meant. Really, I did.  But about a week and a half ago I shot a speedball no different than any other I had done for years, and for some reason, I GOT A BELL RINGER. Thought I was going to die (in the most euphoric way possible). This has opened me up to a whole NEW level of drug euphoria, and my mental fiend of a brain cannot seem to comprehend that all this time, I was not experiencing this phenomenon that I, until now, didn't even know existed.

How do you guys control the craving for that coke rush? It's really made using drugs damn near impossible for me now because of how expensive and the consequences it has on my life/health.

TL;DR- After 6 years IV use, finally had a bell ringer speedball... mental fiending is now unprecedented... how do you guys deal with the fact that such a feeling is obtainable in this human form? Borderline throwing away my life to get that feeling as much as possible.. ",1473094045.0

(weird chemistry I guess),"I'm just posting this to add to the general body of knowledge. I have had weird experiences and if this helps other people evaluate their own situation then I'm glad.

1) Started with Tylenol 3/codeine. That was great until I found 

2)Hydrocodone cough meds/vicodin. With the hydro cough stuff you could drink as much as you wanted to (the deterrent they put in is not dangerous like Tylenol just annoying.)

3) Graduated to Oxy

4) Recently got my master's in H.

5) Spent a year on pods. I used to grind and eat the powder in grapefruit juice. OH my god the giant awful shits!!!

Ok...cut to now...Hydro no longer gets me high at all. I can consume large amounts and barely feel it (even after months of being 'clean'.)

I recently tried PST with well-rated source. Absolutely nothing.
Tried Kratom- nothing.

H. has a weird effect on me. Very little euphoria but I get- best I can describe it as manic...I yell and curse, run around, kick my legs if lying down. I know it's weird.

Oh I forgot- I had a shady doc Rx me like 1000 Tramadol back in the day and I was 'stable' on that. I took 2 tabs per day and never increased the dose. It always gave me a little high and helped me deal with work. When they scheduled it it basically ruined my life.

Ok, so basically all I have are Oxy and H (sort of) to get high. ",1473261738.0

Proproxyphene was originally a hydrochloride so they put napsylate in which lowers peak blood levels, hence why the original Darvon had 65mg proproxyphene hydrochloride, but to deter abuse and avoid IV use they changed it to napsylate...so apparently 65mg proproxyphene is equal to 100mg proproxyphene? 
        
I've gotten 3 or 4 scripts for Darvocet N - 100 (100mg proproxyphene napsylate / 650 APAP) and always thought it was quite a weird opiate. Usually did nothing or barely anything, but a few times it really fucked me up.
        
One-time I had just finished off a script of #30 perc 10mgs. Went back to the gp and she said pain level shouldn't warrant oxycodone but she'd  RX me Darvocet for diarrhea lol. Tolerance at time was 50 to 70mg oxycodone. Got home and took ONE Darvocet and 20mins later was high af. Mostly like a codeine methadone mix feeling nice body load and sleepy euphoria. Happened a few times over the years (even with a high tolerance) with 1 to 5 pills pre suboxone, but the next dose after felt like weak Tylenol 4.

She tells me she knows someone who can get me anything that I want.

That first bowl already got me high because low tolerance and some of the best bud ive had. I waited 20 minutes and took the other 50mg then layed in bed. I began to feel the high switch from a weed high to a tramadol high as the weed wore off. I noticed because it switched from sativa feelings to a heavy indica feeling. I got up, and damn, I didnt really know opiates could get you this kind of high. Has all the opiate body buzz but is very stimulating mentally. 

I then took another 1.5 grams of kava kava and smoked another fat bowl. Here I am now, 2.5 hours in and holy shit I feel good. Like insanely good. Breathing is a bit weird but im not nodding so il be fine.

My only other opiate experiences was 2oz of lean about a year ago and 10mg of hydrocodone earlier that day. This left my tolerance nearly at 0. I also only weigh 118 lbs.

This is a massive wakeup call for me and I'm not going to touch heroin again as I don't even like it that much! It gives me a slight motivation and mood boost and that's all, the only reason I even use it is because it's like a mild stim (I love stims!) but with no side effects or comedown...

As requested, here's the full story.","Before I indulge myself in some pounding on my keyboard for the next hour or so, let me preface this by saying that I am by no means a great writer. Don't start this lengthy post expecting my writing style to be that of u/morbo2000 or other similar writers on r/opiates. Anyways, here's a window into my fucked up past. 

In high school I was your average stoner kid. I had plenty of friends who messed with prescription pills (oxys and xanax mainly) but always had that mentality of ""never fucking ever."" From when I started smoking pot until halfway through my senior year I was that guy who preached ""pot is enough for me. I don't need any other drugs."" I didn't even drink alcohol in high school.

I'm a curious person by nature and one night randomly found myself researching the effects of MDMA. I spent days researching it. What it felt like, effects on your body and brain, all that jazz. Then just days later one of my friends randomly gets his hands on some ecstasy rolls (this was before molly was a thing/trend/popular). I sat with that pill in my dresser for months then one night out of the blue I decided ""fuck it."" That was the night that my outlook of ""weed is enough"" changed completely. Anyone who has done some really clean ecstasy for their first time knows how insanely mind blowing it is (or at least it was for me). 

I still stayed away from prescription pills and 'hard' drugs but started experiments with psychedelics, party drugs, and stuff of that nature. I went straight from high school to KU. I wasn't in class for 2 days before someone was offering me adderall telling me how much it would help with school. That was the first prescription drug I took and afterwards I had the realization of ""maybe prescription drugs aren't bad...I mean DOCTORS prescribe them, the GOVERMENT makes them so they must be safe..."" 

Fast forward two years into college my grades were so borderline that I failed to meet the criteria of academic probation by .004% of a GPA. By this time I'm an extremely heavy xanax user with a small group of new friends all doing the same thing. Needless to say I was losing weeks, if not months, at a time due to blackouts. I ended up being kicked out of KU and became determined to do whatever I needed to for my family not to find out. 

My home address was still my parents house so all of the mail from KU would go right to their house. I knew that since I was kicked out, I would be getting a letter from KU notifying me of the dismissal. Except this would go to their mailbox..After calling the main KU offices I had about a week window that I knew the letter would arrive during. I spent a few hours everyday for 5 days camping out waiting for the mailman. My patience paid off and eventually the letter exchanged hands straight from the mailman to mine. I scanned the letter and envelope (never know when you're going to need an official looking envelope or letterhead) and after it was put straight into the shredder. 

My mentality at this time was that I could met the requirements for re-admission and get back in by the next semester without anybody ever knowing. I was kicked out after a Spring semester so I had an entire summer to plan everything out to a T. After being kicked out I came to the conclusion that I was addicted to xanax and needed to stop. I had no idea that withdrawals from xanax were actually dangerous so I pretty much locked myself in a room for a week and rode it out...0/10 would not recommend. This is also the summer that I started using opiates. Until finding this subreddit I never knew how fortunate I was with the drugs available but my first opiate was a beautiful orange-ish G74 opana (40mg). That one pill lasted me probably 2 weeks due to being cautious with my dosing. Opana was always been readily available so I never knew how uncommon it was. I digress; 

Eventually the summer was over and I moved back to KU. As an addict when theres a major obstacle (such as what the fuck do I do when my parents want to pay tuition) I tend to think ""I'll cross that bridge when I come to it."" Well, eventually that bridge came. KU has something called a ""Beak Em Bucks"" account. Which you can put money in and it can only be used at local food establishments and the KU Bookstore. My genius idea was to put their account info into my Beak Em Bucks account instead of tuition account then just photoshop up an invoice for tuition. So that's exactly what I did. It took a few days and my parents called me because they got a call from KU saying that the money was being refunded due to me not being a student there. It was such an ""oh shit.."" moment for me I'm not sure what lie I even came up with during that phone call but I do know that it worked.

I ended up offering my roomate 300$ to let me put the money into his Beak Em Bucks account. Then he could go to the bookstore and buy as many Macbook's as the account could afford and I would just sell them on Craigslist, new-in-box never opened for 200-300$ less than retail and sell them within hours. That's exactly what ended up happening. Well, one semester lead to another..and another...and another. I kept telling myself that I would get back into school ""next semester."" But as an addict I'm practically a pro at coming up with mental excuses not to do things so it never happened. It came to the point where I determined I was just going to ride out the storm and let the cards fall as they may. Again the ""cross that bridge when we come to it"" mentality.

It was coming up on my 4th year of faking college, 6th year overall and my family started asking questions about graduation. I ""changed my major"" a number of times as excuses for needing more time but now it was practically time to graduate. I kept with the ""I'll deal with it eventually"" train of thought.

In late December one year I had the mortifying experience of accompanying my then girlfriend of 6 years to the apartment she lived in with her mother. Her mom was an addict too (Not sure what exactly..I never really asked specifics because it was a tough subject for her). She had killed herself a few days prior. It changed me. Seeing the pure, raw emotion my girlfriend went though. Hearing the tone of her voice, the look in her eyes, and her deemer impacted in a severe way that day. I will forever remember that day as if it happened yesterday. 

Until one night (February 2nd..I'll never forget it) I came back to my parents house for dinner. I was withdrawing probably the hardest I ever had, broke, and broken mentally. I knew if I came home for dinner I could bullshit something and get 100$ out of them. Shit I would have settled for 30$...Being a mother, my mom knew something was up. They ended up giving me money but my mom stopped me as I was leaving and gave me this huge heart to heart about she knows I'm not in a good place, and how if I just talked about it to them they would help me in anyway they could (later found out they thought it was about a female). At the time I shrugged it off. My mind was focused on the 100$ in my pocket and the text on my phone saying ""come through.""

Now I'm not religious by any means. Sure, I accept the higher power thing because I've been through rehab/NA and they practically shove it down your throat. But something happened when I left the house that night. Something intervened on my path from home to dealers house. I was pumping my gas and paused for a split second and everything my mom said hit me like a mother fucking freight train carrying bricks. Got back in my car and just bawled for an hour sitting at this gas station. I'm sure countless people saw me but I didn't give a shit. I didn't go get high that night. That night I ended up going back to KU and I sat in silence, alone in my room until morning. I wanted so desperately for it all to be over. I wanted the drugs out of my life, I wanted to stop getting sick, stop robbing people, destroying my relationships, I was done with all of it. I texted my dealer at 5am asking when I could come though...but at 6am before he could respond I decided to throw in the towel.

I called my mom at 6am (a phone call I will never forget my entire life). I was expecting her reaction to be hostile, fuck you, good luck, something along those lines. When she answered she could tell I was crying and the first words out of my mouth were ""Mom...I'm a drug addict...Not like I smoke too much pot...Like I put hundreds of dollars worth of pain meds up my nose on a daily basis.."" I went on to tell her I wasn't actually in school, along with a list of other things a parent doesn't want to hear. Her exact words were ""*opticsoldier* put the dog in your car and come home. We're going to fix this and everything is going to be alright.""

Shit I'm tearing up just typing this now haha. 

I was expecting that to be one of the last times I talked to my parents and their reaction was the polar opposite. Honestly had they told me to fuck off I'm not sure I would be alive today. I was in a dark place and the only thing that kept me going those last few months was a Saint Bernard that I got during a couple months I spent clean. I couldn't abandon something I forced into my life. I did exactly what my mom said. I got my big-ass-dog in the car and headed home. It's about a 45 minute drive to my parents house and they spent that whole time researching what addiction even is. They never even knew I was smoking pot more than once a year. 

That's the bulk of the story. This was ~3 years ago now. I'm just over a year clean now. 1 rehab, 6 therapist, and countless NA meetings. If you're reading this, high or sick and sober, thinking that it isn't possible, just know that it is. Love all you guys. If you made it this far through my post you're a trooper! 

Stay Up and Stay Safe. (Stay Clean for those of you clean and struggling). 

I'm headed to dinner and wanted to post this before I left. I haven't checked for typo's and grammar yet but I will when I get back.

Enjoy!

On the grass just beyond the curb lay a female on her face, purse and one shoe strewn around her. Her shirt was bunched in a way as if she'd been thrown. I stop immediately, throw on my emergency flashers, exit my car and run toward her. My first thought was she's been hit by a car hit and run style just by the way she and her things were laying there.

I get to her, she's trying to move and I say stay still, please don't get up as I'm dialing 911. I tell them she may have been hit by a car but I saw no vehicle near her or the scene. So they're enroute and I'm asking her what happened. Her speech is sort of garbled, incoherent and she keeps trying to move her head around. I see that she has been/still is sobbing, snot just pouring from her nose and smeared all over her face but I see no blood. Ok, maybe that's good but she keeps saying ""they are trying to kill me"" but when I ask who? I can't make out what she's saying again. Her eyes keep rolling around as myself and others who've shown up to help, keep trying to keep her down. All the while she keeps insisting ""they"" are trying to kill her. This time when I ask who is ""they"" and what have they done, she replies ""my roommate's boyfriend shot me!! Oh holy hell!! Where?? Where are you shot?? She's trying to shake her head ""no"" as I'm trying to keep her still, trying to calm her down because this whole time she's hyperventilating,  screaming she can't breathe and her chest hurts bad!! 

I'm thinking, these first responders better hurry the he'll up!! Finally, I hear sirens in the distance, getting closers and closers. Yes, finally!! But now this poor young woman is REALLY trying to move, get up, roll over .... I don't know, thrashing of sorts and she's trying to speak again saying ""they"" shot her with heroin because ""they"" want her dead. I'm thinking ohhh man, ok...this now is making more sense to me. So when the first responders get there, I run up to quick fill them in that it may not be a car/pedestrian accident but a drug overdose and I tell them what she said. The first responders took over, my car was parked in the road still so I left but I pray they were able to help her and that she's OK.

A common practice to seperate the opioids and APAP is doing a cold water extraction, which can be a lot of hassle and easily wasteful. 

Instead, what I was thinking about is this: APAP toxicity can be almost totally prevented/reversed by administering Acetylcysteine within the first 8 hours of ingestion. Research also shows that the two taken together in appropriate dose-ratios even if the APAP dose is much higher than the liver can handle, work just as well to cancel out toxicity. So instead of doing CEWs on painkillers, it is safe to assume that taking big amounts of them with Acetylcysteine would be just as safe, am I correct? Acetylcysteine is OTC and not expensive in pharmacies as far as I know. It would save codeine/hydrocodone/etc. users a lot of time and hassle to use their opiates just the way they want to without having to worry about liver damage.

I've never had this before but I'm going to see the doctor today and hopefully he'll just cut it open, drain that shit and have me go on my merry way. 

Have any of you had an abscesses before? Any horror stories or weird junkie remedies?

I thought you guys here might just appreciate my writing more than anyone else I may know.,"Imagine; walking. Just walking, you keep going, but you decide for a moment to stop. You look down and realise, that whole way, you were just carrying a big old bag- one just holding the weight of your world. 
Imagine the feeling when you just drop that bag you never knew you were carrying. When your shoulders cry in relief, but you never knew any different. 
Getting home and taking off your gloves, your jacket, your boots; just laying back and enjoying that feeling; the one of knowing you don't have to carry it all around anymore. 
But you get too used to it; you become accustomed to loosing the weight of that bag, to sitting in loose clothes, laying in bed. Because you'll have to pick up that bag, get on your shoes and your jacket and your gloves, and you'll have to keep walking. You'll have to keep walking knowing you could be walking without all that weight. It feels heavier. Where your feet bounced upon each step, now you struggle to lift them off the ground to move another inch forward. 
Addiction isn't a weight, it isn't a bag, it isn't a monkey on your back.

It's that relief, just disappearing into how it was. Knowing it could be so much better than this. Knowing the potential you have to be happy, weightless- but still carrying that luggage, constantly remembering now, remembering that weight. 
To you, it was never there before. You don't remember the weight, because you've never let it go. But, the moment you do, the moment you let that relief melt from your head down to your toes, the moment you let go of that package, you will, forever- the rest of your time-  remember how easy it was  to simply let go. And you'll never want to hold on again. 
That moment of happiness simply isn't worth a lifetime of yearning.",1473321829.0

I was on 16mg a day for two years..... Last November I tapered down to 1mg every other day and went to rehab.  Stayed for a month and by the time I completed my month and got my stupid metal I had lost 25 pounds and got about 2 hours of sleep a night due to restless body syndrome. It never went away and as soon as I got home I sniffed a line and before you know it was up to 2 and a half 8mg subutex a day. I felt like I was going to be on it for life and contemplated suicide everyday. So here's the cure I'm talking about. 

I like to partake in recreational research chemicals and have loved MXE/ketamine for years it's my drug of choice second being benzos. There is a research chemical called Deschloroketamine which is a longer lasting more sedating analog of ketamine. I always knew ketamine took away opiate withdrawal but always would take it while on the bupe. Last week I ordered some DCK off of my go to rc vendor and got high on it for three days straight using benzos and gabapentin to sleep. I didn't take any subs during these three days.  Here's the kicker.... When I woke up on the fourth day I noticed my nose wasn't running I wasn't sneezing or suffering from restlessness. ABSOLUTELY  NO WITHDRAWAL AT ALL.  KETAMINE OR EVEN BETTER DCK CURES YOUR BRAIN FROM OPIATE ADDICTION WHETHER ITS A FULL AGONISTS LIKE HEROIN OR PARTIAL AGONISTS LIKE SUBOXONE/SUBUTEX. 

I haven't been this happy or felt this good in 5 years. I can finally look forward to my future. My depression and social anxiety / general anxiety is completely gone also. I wish this was widely known but you know it never will be because rehabs across the world would lose 90% of their business. ",1473316460.0

https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/5107ti/timesensitive_i_have_chronic_pain_which_i_took/

Well, I'm starting to get concerned with what I have to do to fight for proper medical care when it becomes time for that. Currently, I'm legally disabled with NO insurance (except for my psych meds but whatever) and I really, REALLY need to be on a medical regimen of either hydro or oxy. Not a lot. I just want to be able to live my goddamn life.

Right now, I'm practically sans medication. I'll have a few month's worth of kratom in about 5 days. So the short-term is mostly fixed. But I have no idea what I'm gonna do in a few months when I run out of the only thing keeping me functioning.

Vent time.
I'm a 19 year old kid and I feel like I'm 70 or some shit with how I feel. I barely passed high school and I had to go to the nurse every day to lay down because my pain was so unbearable. My only saving grace was my mom, who has helped me so much through this and been so understanding. She's a chronic pain sufferer too (disc/shoulder issue and neuropathy) and neither of us are on any effective pain medication. A relative is, and we ""share"". It's not nearly enough or even close to a normal therapeutic regimen, though. It sucks. I'm on gabapentin AND an SSRI AND I've been through rigorous physical therapy which only made things worse and made me feel like I was lazy or it was my fault I wasn't getting better, because fibromyalgia patients apparently don't deserve opiates no matter how much they help and no matter how hard they've tried to use other options. I feel fake, and lost. I feel like no doctor in the world will ever care. I have latent depression which has been nearly cured but I'm having a horrible episode right now over this. My life is in someone else's hands, someone who may or may not understand. I'm scared. I'm scared of having to live in my bed. I'm starting to get really upset so I need to stop, sorry for that.

Vent over, real shit begins
I really need to know how the pain management system works. How the fuck I can get insurance, how to get a doctor, and all of that. I've never done this before and I'm really confused. I dunno if there are any websites where you can like, talk to doctors in your area to figure out options or something, or what. I hate going into this blind. I really need the perspectives and experiences of people who have been through the circuit, whether medical like me or recreational, I don't judge. Please helpme figure out how to take this into my own hands, because I feel powerless.

He says I'll hit you up when in close! He's only 15-20 mins tops from me so I'm like cool...set my shot up and stare at my wall waiting....and waiting...and waiting...Dafuck?!

So I call him...he says oh I'm still with buddy waiting for him to give it to me....what?!? It's been 45 mins and you didn't even leave yet....omggg haha I'm screaming in my head visualizing jumping off the Empire State Building into a pool of syringes.

Finally the 3rd call he says I'm 10 mins away! Oh snap! Ya boy bouta get his medicineee.!!.....

So homie pulls up 12 mins later, I grab it, thank him, and sprint into my house, up my stairs, into my roo--- wtf? I'm locked out of my room! Why Jesus, why me?

Is smoking more potent or way less? I understand that high heat and opiates is a wasteful way to *do* a pill but will smoking one pill do it for me where I would have to eat 2 or would I have to smoke 2 to equal the oral 2?

Does that make sense, what I'm asking?

Also, I know that shooting up is way more potent and yields the best B.A. and that you need *way* less but how much less?

ANYWAY


i'd smoked a fair amount of herion eariler and had maybe a tad too much and had a touch of nausea which took away the euphoria. I decided to have a very small bump of Hexen, a Research chemical (Full name Ethyl-Hexedrone). it's a cathinone NDRI so basically acts quite like coke. However it's a bit gentler than coke. diet coke. It had recently lost its magic for me. However, when combined with my H high, it gave me the most wonderful rush and flush of euphoria that lasted a good 2 hours. and came back when redosed.

I know this could be bad advice and primary focus should be harm reduction. But i used the smallest ammount. About 1/4 of the amount i'd usually use of hex-en.

Be careful always when combining drugs. i feel this is relatively safe as it's the smallest little tickle of hexen on top. But yeah, if you have both of these drugs, i recommend trying this mix. I imagine it's a bit like a diet speedball. (heroin was smoked, hex was snorted)",1473270547.0

So I was just really rude to her and brushed her off and she got the hint and left. And when my dealer got there I told her what had happened and she was like, ah, Fuck that bitch. 

But I wish I hadn't have been waiting for her at the time. 

How could she have thought I would have wanted to see her? How could she have thought I wouldn't hate her for what she did? She admitted it and I saw papers proving it, it's not disputed. How delusional is this girl?!

My mom was out today for a while and she ran into a lady who also has fibro, and apparently she's completely stocked up because she had every pharm you could think of. Very nice lady according to my mom. She gave my mom some fentanyl patches for free. Anyways, I have a very low tolerance and I'm barely on anything right now due to low supply and I can't use these, even at the lowest dose (which I think they are). I really wish my mom had told her that I couldn't use them so I could get something else, but I digress.

So... I have these low dose fentanyl patches sitting around now. Since it's caused a lot of dangerous events I feel like it's probably in low demand (I wouldn't know, never dealt or been dealt with) but since it's actually in the patch at a known dose I guess it would be more in demand. Anyways, I'd really like to trade these for some hydros and/or oxys because I can use those but idk if I should even try. 

Basically I want to know what the street price and pill equivalent is (I live in the south if it's regional) and whether it's in demand enough for someone to even WANT to trade with me if I had the opportunity.

Thanks for the info, I appreciate it. I feel like I'm gonna get more tempted the more these stay around, so I hope I can do something about it without straight up tossing them out.

Then, on tuesday, I popped 10mg hydrocodone and smoked some good kush before school (horray being 18 in senior year). At first I only felt the weed but soon i felt extremely orgasmic all over and was flirting with 2 girls at my table pretty heavily. Then that evening, I had a headache all day so I took 150mg of tramadol when i got home from school. Again I smoked hella kush and ended up not feeling it so i took a 30 minute nap but when I woke up the intensity blew me away. It lasted so long too, was very fun to smoke kush and nod after every hit while playing video games all night. The next day i had a headache again all day, so it seems that opiates give me a hangover. So that evening I popped 3 norcos and went to bible study, everyone noticed I was tired even though I felt normal. Apparently I was just super slow and I fell asleep eating my lasagna more than once. 

Today I had the house to myself so I pulled out a bottle of 300-60 codeine pills. I ate 6 of them after looking up the doses and seeing people saying take 500. WhatI didnt realise was that these people were opiate addicts and not opiate naive kids. So i start smoking some of my super fire kush, decide to buy a 60sack from my guy. He takes 30 mins to get to my house and I am super high off the kush at this point. The codeine starts kicking in and I smoke a bowl in his car, he notices im slow af. So i take my bag of weed inside and decide to test the new batch. I smoke several fat bowls, but I am already extremely high. So high that no matter how much I smoke its not effecting me much more so I put everything away. Well,  I always thought the ""lean has me horizontal"" song lyrics to be bullshit until this high. I litterally couldnt walk straight and had poor balance like a drunk person. 

But thr bad part happens here. I brushed my hair against something which started the most intense itch of my life. I started to scratch and instantly the itch spread over my head and face. Scratching was so orgasmic that as I feriously scratched it gave me visuals and I kept feeling so overwhelmed I would almost think I was dying. Anyways I decided my head was gonna get raw if I didnt stop but every time I tried to stop the itch got so much worse. It was tingling all over every part of my scalp and I ended up on the floor begging for it to stop. Then it got worse. It spread to my face, and I didnt want to scratch it, so i used the pads of my fingers to rub the skin, however wherever I rubbed my skin suddenly felt as if it was on fire. The burning was so bad and it moved from my face to my head to my whole body. Suddenly the skin on the inside of the rim of your eyelid, the part that gets puffy when you smoke, started to itch. The slightest touch and all around my eyes felt like someone was butane torching my eyelids. Then my eyes started toitch and I couldnt see. I made it doen stairs and popped a benadryl. The benadryl relieved me in 30 mins but made the nods so sedating that it wasnt as pleasant as before. I really enjoyed the high, but rolling on the floor on the verge of tears from the itch almost made it not worth it. 

Does anyone else get the itch that bad? The syrup didnt make me itch, neither did the hydros or the trams.",1473389223.0

Idk why so sick considering I had 2 nice bags the night before at like 9pm. Didn't sleep all night, and restless legs kicked in around 3-4am. Fucked. Idk why so fast. So around 11am I say fuck it, I had money but no way to my dude who was busy helping his roommate do trim work at their house. So I take a lyft about 25 mins to him. Only cost 15$ pretty decent, beat a taxi or waiting for the bus and the 2 hours the bus would have taken. Get into my dudes truck, he hands me 3 bags. I start making my shot, start to draw up, and boom my fucking rig gets stuck and the plunger pops out leaving rubber in and it popped out so fast that I dropped my spoon all over my shorts. Fucked. So fucked. Just lost 2 bags. Down the drain. Dunzo. So I say fml and do my last bag so I can get relief, and head up to the Burger King where I got my cousin to scoop me up and save me the money for a ride home. I get home, and have like 3 cottons that were pretty soaked with shit. So I do em, and instantly I'm nodding out like I just shot all three of those bags at once. I get woken up to a call from another job I applied for. So that's cool a second job would be good for me to keep me busy and pockets fat. So now I'm sitting here, staring at this huge white stain on my basket ball shorts, and these restless legs are kicking back in. Literally 2 bags of dope soaked into my basketball shorts and I have no idea how I would even get it out, haha I tried to put some water on it and rub it then suck up with my syringe but he material sucks and just wouldn't let me suck anything up. This blows lol. Why are my withdrawals starting only a few hours after each shot all the sudden? I mean the past month I was on a crazy bender doing as much dope as I wanted all day and night and then went from that to nothing really since my dude has been in and out of hospital and we haven't had any jobs. Fuck man this life is too crazy too many ups and downs in such a short time I'm getting gray hairs from this stress and I'm only 27.

Tl;dr.  Woke up sick, took a lyft to cop. Spilled almost all my dope due to a faulty rig and me being clumsy and sick. Got relief for an hour or two and I'm back to shit. No Bueno. I need my license back",1473377382.0

I usually snort perk 10s to get off but I think I have an extra needle in my cabinet from when I had to vaccinate my kitty. It's the same thing as an insulin needle so I imagine it'll be fine to use. Do I have to use a lighter and ""cook"" it to dissolve it into a shootable form like you see on tv and shit?   
  
I don't wanna fuck this up cuz I'm low on dough, but I've got a little cake and all I have to do is go down to the hood and ask one of the brothers that are out for heroin instead of tree like I normally get so I got that covered. So really I just wanna know how many heroin bags I need to get my nod on and have some cool ass nodding dreams like dude was talking about in the other thread. No wonder the people on this sub love dope. It sounds like the best thing since sliced bread.   
  
And, I know y'all are gonna give me bullshit and say not to do it because it's a slippery slope and I'll just get addicted like you guys, but you'd be wrong cuz I've done weed, ecstacy, mdma, and even did crack once and never got addicted so y'all don't gotta worry about me cuz I'm too strong and unlike most people I have self control and shit, so suck it. 
  
I'm gonna get some heroin bags and do them anyway, I just figured I'd ask for some harm reduction advice to try and be safe. I just want to know how many should I do so I don't OD? Thanks.    
  
EDIT: I've also got some experience speed balling cuz I mixed a line of coke with a perk 30 a few times and got super lit so I'm pretty sure I can handle a shot of heroin. I'm not a noob so plz don't treat me like one....OH, and I've got a couple of xanax bars for the comedown cuz usually when I get all fucked up I have trouble going to sleep.

I am not a drug user, and have never been. But my brother was an intravenous user of cocaine or heroin (I am not sure exactly which one.) We are from a good, middle class, educated family (mom is a doctor, and dad is an engineer), so when we discovered him doing drugs it was pure shock that felt like stabbing. It was a complete loss of interest in life, depression, and endless crying behind close doors for all family members. His 2 close friends died from overdoses (and we had no idea they were doing drugs because they were very good boys from decent families too). 

His friends hooked him on drugs when he was around 25 years old. One day under influence he attacked our dad with a knife on the second floor of our house near the stairs. My dad is an old man and with a much smaller frame than my brother, so he had to put a crazy amount of strength to subdue my brother (they nearly fell off the stairs together with a big kitchen knife in their hand). For the next several days dad was so sick (all the joint, body pain and emotional distress). 

My brother was so mean, violent and angry at us all the time, we couldn't figure out what was going on. We mistakenly thought that he was having too much stress at work. 

It was a hot summer day when I saw many little red and blue dots on his arm. For a little while my brain couldn't connect those dots with drug use  (I was 14-15 years old at that time). It took me a lot of thinking to relate his violent behavior with substance abuse. And by the way, if it was not me who noticed, my parents would have buried him already. 

So during this process it hit me that the notion that drug users are only coming from broken, unhappy, low income families is just not true, and my family was a glaring example. Little did I know that dealers are in fact preying on those who can easily afford buys all that crap like my brother could. 

We all (mom, dad, and I) still suffer from post traumatic stress disorder, although it has been 15 years now.  

He is now fully recovered, which is pure magic. We just got lucky. I know we just won a lottery with such outcome because other examples are nearly always deadly. 

So... When you put a needle again next time up in your arm, think about those who you hurt the most even when they don't know it now. They will learn about it nonetheless when you die from an accidental overdose. 

The pain is profound and indescribable, and it never goes away.

I chew up 1/4 of a 100 mcg patch, and about 4 hours after chewing it I decide to say fuck it, let's take this sub. Cuz usually once I'm in WD I don't want sub, I just want more Blues or Fent Patches, or even Black if im desperate. So I take the sub EARLY. I wasnt high at the time but definitely not sober nor in withdrawal. 

About 15 minutes after I take it I start to feel like I'm not myself. It's not hallucinating, but it's a feeling of depersonalization and derealization. Probably the worst part of Precipitated WD to be honest. Anyway, the usual stuff happens - dilated pupils, runny nose, stomach cramps, SWEATS, teary eyes... the funniest part was I had the AC blasting in my car before the sub, and then once the WD started I immediately had to turn the AC off and turn the heat on actually. Went from warm to FREEZING in about 2 minutes. 

But the hell only lasted about 2 hours I would say, and then after that I just felt barely sick. It's really not that much different than a normal withdrawal, and overall I am glad I took the sub early because now I have been on sub 3 days and I'm off the fent patches.

annyyywayysssss, just wanted to say after 5-6 years off moderate prescription drug use, to really stepping it up to boy in the past two years, to IVing in June/July, I have decided to go onto maintenance via methadone.

nothing too serious, 70mg.

I have watched 7-8 people I cared about either 1) overdose, or 2) fucking drop dead, all this summer.

what really made me jump off this unicorn of opiates was watching my homie's sister OD right in front of my face. I'm a young guy, & never witnessed something like that before.

the next day I was signing up for treatment at my local clinic.

I know methadone isn't the cure-all, & can be worse to come off of than boy, but, it's allowed my to function like a 'normal' human bean..

on a side note, i've picked up a little benzo habit, 'little' is all a matter of perspective, I guess.

I love you all, & have had a blast on this fourm, reading & chatting with you all. I am not going away, just figured I'd let you all know what's up.

I almost killed my mother via stress over these past few years, & the past 2-4 months especially.

not saying I'm sober as a judge now, obviously, but, I have hopped off this wild roller coaster we all know & love so much.

wish me luck, & I'll do the same for you all, as y'all are fam.

peace & love, stay safe out there, the blocks are hot, & the streets are cold as ice.

Got into opiates back in the mid 90s doc hopping getting Norcross and old school oxycontin's. A few years later I was sick of always running out a week after I got a months worth of scripts.
     Move to heroin shooting BTH.  After a few years could not handle the wd's. So I moved to MMT.  Back then the still offered LAMM so for my first year at the clinic I stated on methadone, switched to LAMM, then they discontinued it and it was back to Methadone.
     I was lucky enough to find a doc who would prescribe my methadone for pain and on my first visit with him he gave me 360ea 10mg methadone pills (I was on 120mg a day).  (By this time pharmacy's couldn't give out the 40mg wafers anymore as the wafers were regulated to clinics only.  
     After a few months this guy was giving me my methadone, 120 10mg perc's for breakthrough pain, 120 350mg somas, 90 10mg Valium and 60 provigil 
     As soon as I saw they were brining opana to the market (1996) I printed out their info from the website and told him I wanted to switch from methadone to opana.  
    The man started me off with 40mg yellow stop signs 3x a day.
     I loved this guy but he left his job to be the head medical dog at a prison a few counties away.  After he left no one in his practice would continue my regimen.  So I was forced to go back to MMT.  I was back there for 6 years with a dose of 100mg a day (I knew I would fuckÃ¬ng loose everything if I went back to smack)  
     Fast forward to last year when I was in an accident and now I found a decent PM doc who listens asks what works for me.
      I think it's a matter of time till the titrate me down to where I'm fuckÃ¬ng uncomfortable.  So when that time comes I guess it's back to MMT.

Been busy lately but wanted to share an observation. Opiates has very much decreased my weed consumption. Not that it was heavy, and it's still regular, but much lighter now. Some of this is obvious, but it has literally caused me to be more productive. Weed is great, but it does have this dulling, antimotivational aspect to it. Now, my tolerance is lower, so I enjoy it more, and I'm literally doing less than ever before. 

It's become where I have my set times I can get high. Because of this I don't find myself sitting around puffing many hits of weed. I wait until the time is right, I have one hit, and I'm great until the next time.",1473505688.0

God i love this and hate this so much.","This drug has ruined my life, i had an absolutely gorgeous girlfriend who wanted to marry me. and who i was going to ask to marry me this winter, start a family and spend the rest of my life with me, who stuck by me through all the lies over the course of the almost 5 years we were together, of me telling her i wasn't doing drugs, when i was either popping pills or doing coke or whatever, first it was doing adderall behind her back, she found out for the first time that i was doing drugs, and told me she wasn't cool with it, so i stopped, then a couple months later i started doing perks, figuring i wouldn't get caught, i said fuck it and started doing shit again, "" she wont leave me "" i thought, and she didnt, eventually moved to Roxys, and of course, got caught doing that, she stuck with me through that too, fast forward to getting caught another 6 times doing various pills and drugs and lying to her and getting caught and shes pretty fed up with my drug problem at this point, but now weve been togehter for 3 years and we love each other very much, weve spent every single waking day together, and work at the same place on the same shift, we literally were with each other 24/7 365 for almost 4 years straight. then the pills got too expensive, so i tried heroin last summer, and i got hooked on that bad, despite the fact that i found my best friend dead on his bedroom floor with a needle still in his arm because he died instantly from whatever was in the bags he got, and eventually i got to the point of shooting up to about 2 bundles a day, sometimes more, and i got sloppy one night and left the open needle on her bathroom floor ( i lived with her and her family at the time )


Her brother woke up in the morning and almost stepped on my used needle, and i got caught using heroin via IV by her, at this point i am destroying this girls heart, she was such a good girl, shes never done a pill a day in her life, she dint even want to do the ibuprofen she was prescribed for her tooth pain. But she agreed to give me one last chance to prove to her that i can finally stop taking drugs and that i can be the man i have to be that she deserves, and treat her the way she deserves to be treated after all i put her, her family and my family through i owed it to them to get clean, i didnt have a job at the time so i said fuck rehab and i quit cold turkey and detoxed off a 2 bun a day habit for 2 weeks straight. With just her by my side taking care of me. This was this past exactly one year ago.


Fast forward 10 months and i was at work having an extremely bad night, and i had someone i work with who said "" you want a bag or something you need to chill out "" and i thought long and hard about what the consequences where, i knew if i got caught my girlfriend would leave me forever. So my other co-worker who gets suboxone offered me a sub instead and said don't be stupid take this so you don't wind up relapsing and doing dope again. So i took the sub, and it got me so fucked up, the second i walked in the door that morning coming home from work, my girlfriend knew i was fucked up, and she asked me what i took, i told her the truth that i took the sub and she left me. She doesn't understand that as someone who was addicted to heroin like i was, me taking a sub is not a bad thing, i did the right thing in that situation at least i think i did, but her mentality is if after 10 months of being clean i needed to take a sub because i had an urge to do dope how can she be so sure and feel safe starting a family with me with the change that 10 months after we have a kid i could wind up getting an urge again and doing heroin again.
Ive completely lost the trust of the one person on this planet i never wanted to hurt, i lied and hid it from her because i didn't want to hurt her or risk our relationship, but i had an addiction i couldn't get under control at the same time and shit hit the fan.
Fast forward to now and i'm an absolute fucking wreck, i still have my jobs, i make good money and can afford the things i need but im spending mostly all my extra money on heroin, i cant stop doing it, i just want to stop, im almost up to 30-40 bags a day, i have someone out for me right not at 3:30am picking me up a brick. i want the love of my life back, i want to show everyone that i can be trusted, i want to show everyone that i got clean before and i can do it again, but this time actually stay clean. she said when i get clean and show her im okay that maybe we can work things out, but shes already talking to and fucking some other kid, and its killing me inside, i seriously debated taking all this meth my friend left here and just shooting all of it and killing myself just so i dont have to go through this pain anymore. i just want to go back to the way i was, when i was happy and sharing love with my absolutely amazing and gorgeous girlfriend, she doesnt understand now how much ive learned my lesson, and i dont expect her to believe me after ALL the lies and all the times ive been caught and broke my promise. Shes finally done and will not even budge or give me the slightest chance to try and explain myself. She left me and finally gave up on me and im so lost.


Im sorry this is some absolutely huge rant but i have no one to talk to, no where to go, nothing to do, i need to get off this shit, i want my life back, i dont want to look like im using anymore, im a good looking kid when im sober, im a good person, ive never stolen for drug money or done any grimey shit, i just got hooked onto to some bad shit like an idiot and its ruined my fucking life, i just want to be the normal person i was 6 months ago when i was clean. People were telling me how good i looked, everyone in my family was so proud, my girlfriend loved me and we were closer than ever. And all i did was betray all of their trust and dissapoint myself and everyone around me and lost the best thing that i have ever had in my entire life, and it doesn't seem like she will ever give me the chance to prove to her that i can be the man she deserves. Ive ran out of chances, and im at the end of the road at this point and i dont know what to do or where to go or who to talk to. I tried to message her today to get her to come talk to me, but she "" was too scared because i dont know if you used today "". She doesnt know anything about drugs or what ones do what or how they make you feel and doesnt understand that i would never lay a finger on her, no matter how much heroin i did. but because of all the lies over the years she literally cannot trust anything i say, i have destroyed her as a person, i destroyed the love we truly had for each other, i was going to marry her, start a family, but instead all i have is my computer, a shitty room at a friends house, these needles, these bags, and thats it. Mom kicked me out, girlfriend who said she wanted to marry me and spend the rest of her life with me finally gave up on me. Im so close to the point of giving up on me too, this drug needs to go away for ever, i fucking hate it, why did di have to e so fucking stupid and do this shit again after 10 months of being clean.


TLDR: Im a fucking idiot and relapsed when i knew it was my last chance to show everyone i could be a normal person and my girlfriend of 4 years and future wife finally gave up on us and left me, lost all my familys trust got kicked out of my mom and her boyfriends house. And now all i have is this shitty room, my computer, a chair, a desk, some needles, some bags, and my job around the corner. No purpose in life without my girl anymore. Idk what to do, i need to quit. Now",1473500269.0

A lot of people go with the misconception that after an Overdose, if you use Narcan on someone, they are good to go and safe. THIS IS WRONG! Someone who has overdosed and had Narcan administered by someone, needs to seek immediate medical attention afterwards to be monitored. 

**Half-Lifes:**
>>The Half-Life of Heroin = 3.6 Hours
>>>The Half-life of Narcan/Naloxone = 30 to 81 minutes.

If you do not know what half-life is, the half life is the amount of time for half of a drug to be eliminated from your system. The half life of Heroin 30 minutes, during which it breaks down into Morphine. Morphine's half-life  is 3.6 hours, meaning every 3.6 hours a half of the drug is excreted. 

So let's use a half gram of Heroin as an example.  3.6 hours after dosing, .25 is left in the system. At 7.2 hours, .12 is still in a user's system. 10.8 hours after dosing, .06 is left.  So on and so forth.

Narcan's Half-Life. Initial dose .4mg.  30-60min after dosing, .2mg is left in the system. At 60-120min, .1 is still in a user's system.  90-180min after dosing, .05 is left.  As you can see, Narcan/Naloxone's half-life is much shorter than Heroin/Morphine.

**Okay to break down how it would work with Heroin and getting Narcanned.**

You shoot up a half gram. You have gone over. Someone has administered Narcan to you. They bring you back. You are pissed, but scared, you do not do any more dope even though you feel like shit. But 30 minutes later you are starting to feel super high again. an hour after you were narcanned you are out again. You die, because Narcan is expensive. If you had gone to the hospital, they would of continued to administer Narcan every 30 minutes for 4 hours to make sure all the Heroin has reached a low enough level in your system, so it wont incapacitate you again.

*To explain it in TL;DR*
The legs on Narcan are much much shorter than the legs on Heroin, if you have overdosed and have been given Narcan, you still need to get medical attention.

**Another important note, with the popularity of Carfentanil as a cut, the amount of Narcan you have on hand may not be effective in reversing an opioid overdose. Contact Emergency Services (911) immediately if suspected or Narcan is not bringing the person back.**

Being homeless wasn't too bad, losing a portion of my friends didn't bother me really, but this really fucking did. I've had 2 incredibly close friends since 4th grade. These guys and I fucked shit up all through the school system. When we all got accepted to the same university we roomed together. It's been 2 years of solid rooming together. 

Well my two lads, Bob and Mike (well call them this for anonymity ) decided to go to another city approx 1 hour away from the one we live in to see a live show and see their parents. I wasn't able to go because I had a pharma project. I had no idea how fucked things would become. The time hits 2 am and I'm still working, smoking weed, and watching tv. I received a call from the Denver General Hospital saying my 2 friends had a car crash on the highway with a semi truck. I sat there in shock, all of our memories flashing before my eyes.


Unfortunately I couldn't visit them as they were in critical condition and in emergency surgery. One friend was drunk and coked out while the other passed out on heroin without a seat belt on. The drunk one drove and had 4 shattered vertibrae enter his throat. The other one is in a coma still. I heard this and just cried. I cried for hours. My girlfriend came over with a bag of dope 30 minutes later. I was kind of glad, but I was still crushed. 

The next day we drove up to see them. And what I saw was horrible. Mike had a broken femur as well as 4 prosthetic vertibrae and had an 8 hour surgery to remove all the debris from his throat. We talked a while and he asked how Bob was. Bob had brain swelling so they had to drill in his head and remove pieces of the skull. His face was absolutely swollen. His eyes looked like plums. I couldn't dare tell Mike this because he'd flip out and make things worse. I'm worried because they don't think Bob will make it. That would give my friend a vehicular manslaughter charge and he'd go to prison. Needless to say when we got home I was doing dope again. Fuck. I'm more depressed than I have been in a while.

Sorry for the long post I just needed to vent.... my life has been shitting on me for these past few months   :(.

Tl;dr: 2 friends got in a horrible wreck and I'm doing dope again. Magical",1473489041.0

Your eyes a distant vacant stare,

As I toy with your dark soul, each time your wounds bleed less for me,

Your blood satiates my hunger, I pretend not to notice my stomach rumbling,

I look away from the tears that no longer fall from your cheeks,

I trick myself into thinking you're still bound to me,

I pour out lines, thicker than the scars in my skin that stare at me,

A reminder of my sins,

When I pick up the pen to write our story, the emptiness comes crashing in,

My love I have strayed, I reach to heal you, where Do I begin?

In our current state of opiate induced bliss, 

we kiss, loose lips, wet tongues,

I soak in your pain like a sponge,

We cannot apologize enough, an idea emerges,

as deranged as it was...

it was us.

Take this bullet, and I'll take mine,

take your life and I'll take mine.

We'll meet again on the other side

We'll wipe away the blood and the lies

reconcile where darkness resides

our only hope of rekindling the fire, to be reborn into it,

it will lick our skin clean of our wounds,

we press the cold steel to our temples

I don't consider myself a smart person (in some repects, this being one of them) but I always thought I could handle most drugs and prove the scaremongerers wrong but alas I was wrong.

I started out small, half a gram once a month smoked with my friend. Then it became a bit more frequent but still at a slow rate. I would purchase a half gram or a gram  every week for a friend and I until one day I made the fatal error of finding an IRL contact...

""Yo man know anyone that can sort h?""

""Yeah mate their name is ""X"" here's his #""

I then discovered bags, or 0.2g wraps for a tenner a pop. ""I-fucking-deal"" we thought and proceeded to spiral out of control to the point where both my friend and I were using 5 bags each a day smoked. That's when money got tight so we had to find ways to afford our new habit without fucking anyone over and we did (until fairly recently, different story).

Whenever we tried to stop we would get withdrawals obviously so we decided we were ""functional addicts"" and constantly had heroin. Worth noting we had people-facing jobs and you can tell when someone's a junkie.

This carried on for a long time until last Friday when I came clean to my parents out of desperation to avoid going to work due to withdrawing so badly.

So started the worst withdrawals I've ever experienced but they looked after me until I was better which I am eternally grateful for however I relapsed on Wednesday, bought a few bags, smoked one that day and thought to myself hang on, I don't wanna go through that shit again so I have been, for want of a better word, chipping away at the rest and am about to finish it. My intention is to not use ever again after this and I know my folks and friends will be there luckily but it's gonna be hard because I know the cravings are insane.

Since that Friday last week I have enrolled in a drug counselling group and feel ready to give up for good this time.

Thought I would share this moment with you all whether you like it or not. This is literally my last smoke. Any newbies please be careful, withdrawals ain't fun and you mix with a different kind of dodgy. No matter how curious you are heroin isn't worth it even though I enjoyed every moment of being on it, and you probably don't have the self control you think you do!

With everyone on this sub telling them not to do it.

I get it though. This sub is for advice and general discussion about opiates, and new users are and will always be welcome. I rather have a new user get their info from here than from yahoo answers or bluelight.

But c'mon. Its everyday with this shit. Some dumbass kid asks about opiates, saying he has some and wants to try them, all the users tell him not to, that he's throwing his life away, that we all started just like him, etcetera, etcetera... and then he does it anyway, becomes a member of our community, and tells the next dumbass kid exactly what we told him 6 months ago. It's a never-ending cycle of wasted time for everyone involved.

I'm not saying ban these posts or anything. Like I said, I'm glad new users come here first before trying opiates. It really shows how important this sub is to the opiates community across the world.

But maybe add something to the sidebar that answers all newcomers questions? Or make a sticky that says **Everyone about to try opiates read this** with all of our advice on it with the stories of how we got addicted, and explaining that they're not special, and will get addicted as well?

Just a thought from someone who spends way to much time on here.

It's been three weeks since I stopped using oxy or dope daily. Used subs and meth for 3 days and then stopped everything for like 4-5 days. It fucking sucked. I mainly laid around and slept since I was fortunate enough to not have to work, and by day 5 I was losing my shit. Got some meth and used that for a few days, still no opiates at all at this point. 

The cravings weren't that bad, I just wanted to feel normal and be able to be productive and useful. I was pretty fucking miserable though. Got some meth and used that for a few days. Ran out of meth, had a shit rest of the day and then decided the next day to take some Trams I had laying around- worked surprisingly well at keeping me from being super depressed. 

Next day-no trams, no meth, nothing. What, be totally sober all day during a busy day at work? HA! My boyfriend had already gone back to opiates by this point (but had told me only OPs, which I realize is the same shit but it's different for us) so I knew he had something, and fuck it, it's Friday and I've done such a great fucking job and just want ONE DAY of happiness, I'm gonna ask for some. Turns out it was oxy, our DOC, that he had. He gave me like, 10mg with the idea that only a couple of mg throughout the day would help me. Maybe if I was in physical w/d, but no, I just wanted to have a good damn day for the first time in a couple of weeks, damn it. 

I did the whole thing and it was great- apparently I had a bit of a tolerance decrease in the last two weeks. However, within probably only about 3 hours, I was coming down and feeling 100x worse than I did when I woke up, and knew I had made a big mistake. My mental and emotional state was honestly pretty damn scary. My boyfriend brought me more and I was fine after that, but he asked me to try taking methadone with him. I resisted, but gave in. 

Taking 10mg of methadone a day has helped SO MUCH. I've been taking it for almost a week now, and the past two days have only taken 2.5mg. I did do some meth yesterday just cause it was around, but aside from that I've only done methadone and honestly haven't had the desire to do anything else. I don't feel high, I just feel...content. I'm able to function normally, experience happiness... 

A couple of days ago, I realized that my birthday is coming up. You know what I wanna do for my birthday? Get some fucking blues. I haven't had any cravings, and honestly even now it's not that the craving to use is intense, it's just... it's my fucking birthday, why not? What else would I do?

I realize that this has correlated with the decrease in my methadone dose- anyone have experience with that? I cut down so much because we're almost out and haven't gotten more yet, but if this is a result of that and I can go back to how I was feeling just by taking 10mg a day I will happily do that for awhile and accept the risks/consequences of that.

Anyway, just another shit post/long ramble about being clean and wanting to use on my birthday. Horrible idea? I'm sure I'll do it anyway.

Thanks for listening. Love to all of my fellow addicts here, I hope you're exactly where you want to be whether that is clean and happy or high on the couch ;) ",1473442182.0

So I wait 3 weeks and I get this check in the mail. 

2000 fucking dollars.

I text the dude and I'm like wtf is wrong with you we agreed on 600$ and he was like I'm so sorry my accountant messed it up, when you deposit and cash it send me 1400 through western union.

Now this check looks real as shit, but I have never seen one like it, I get work checks all the time but this apparently is a deposit check where you have to take it to the bank deposit it then cash it.

Also the check is from some corporation not a person. 

On top of that theirs like a note attached that says text your full name and check number to this number. 

So what do you guys think? 

TLDR Put phone on Craigslist, dude makes me wait 3 weeks cause of accountant, dude sends me 2000 when the phone is worth barley 400, tells me keep 600$ send him 1400$ via Western Union.

Roses adorning a majestic stone walkway. A cat curled up peacefully in the shade, exposing his fluffy belly to the sunshine. A stream of crystal clear water flows to your left, you take a knee and cup some into your hand, taking a long refreshing drink. Thereâs a park bench with a couple smiling and embracing each other, he plays with her long blonde hair, her manicured fingernails grazing his thigh. Their love for each other warms your heart, and you get up from the stream and continue your walk on this enthralling day. You are filled with constant contentment, and nothing matters.


Then imagine desolation, gray, decay. You are standing on dry cracked earth, there is nothing, you are nothing. There isnât even a tumble weed. The air is neither hot nor cold. You could sit, but you donât want to. You have no desires, you just are. For miles there is not a thing in sight, and here you stand as time passes but nothing occurs. You are just blank, and nothing matters.


That is the difference between heroin and withdrawal. You go from feeling and being to being cast into an abyss of nothingness. That is what makes it so difficult and impossible to overcome, but keep walking. If you force one foot in front of the other, the dry cracked earth will once again give way to blades of grass.

Once there, I am taken back to get vitals and put in a room.  I am being honest with them telling them it is heroin withdrawals.  A nurse comes in and gets my story from me, then a doctor.  I had wrote a letter that I brought with me explaining my situation, which I handed to the doctor.  He read it, and asked me what I want him to do for me.  I tell him I would like clonidine for wrestless legs, something to help me sleep, and a benzodiazepan to calm me down during the initial three days of severe withdrawal.  He agrees, gives me a scripts for 14 clonidine, 24 hydroxyzine and 5 ativan.  Aftrerwards, I was discharged.  All covered by Ohio State Medicaid :).

tldr: yes it is worth it to go to the hospital for opiate withdrawals.",1473604578.0

Myself being more of a meth head and having very little opioid experience, I tried fentanyl, which was probably a very stupid thing to do but anyways.. I was really surprised and wholly disappointed with the experience. Here's a list of the effects I got:

- nausea
- itchy all over my entire body
- confusion
- absolutely no euphoria
- the mild pain in my shoulders, kinda needing a message sort of thing - totally not relieved
- difficulty walking straight
- dehydration, felt like a med-severe alcohol hangover the next morning

Am I allergic to fent or something?? :(

I also tried OxyContin IR 10mg a bit ago. Snorted the entire thing, felt ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! :(

      As a Brit, well a Brit in France, No.3 is the really the only thing available, as my smoking technique is poor and shooting really isn't something I want to do (Fear of needles) hence I've been reading about the conversion of freebase to salt in a non-lab setting. As I understand it if I add the freebase to an acidic solution (e.g. citric acid and water)  this will convert the freebase to a salt, specifically diamorphine citrate, then simply allowing the precipitate to evaporate it will have converted the no.3 to no.4. 

Now I have a couple of questions for any would be chemist;

i) if when i have converted the freebase to a salt in solution there is any parts that haven't dissolved would it make sense to then filter out any undissolved matter, will this be advantageous to the purity of the end product? 

ii) As I'm not a qualified chemist (Degree in Biology) can anyone work out the molecular mass of Heroin freebase and Heroin Citrate to determine the quantity of Citric acid required to produce a complete reaction? I will be working with 1000mg of heroin freebase.

iii) how much water will be required for complete reaction with said 1000mg of freebase heroin? 

iv) Has anyone done this before? 

v) Will the end product be brown or whitey/beige like ECP? 

vi) Does this sound worth while? (time really isn't of the essence)

Any help really is appreciated! scientific or anecdotal 

Thanks,

I mean, little things, the way we make it through the day, experiencing pleasure. Trees over streets or a small bird fluttering about the garden, paint flaking from the kitchen window panes, dust motes in the sunlight, the wind through the trees. I'm alert, you might say, to the beauty of these things the local nuances that bring life alive. But now all there is is quiet.

If there's enough heroin in my blood, the world gives me comfort. if there's not enough the world makes me sad. Comfort is beauty muted by heroin. Sadness is beauty drained by lack thereof.

I am so far removed, from everything, that I can't even cry. There's a chasm between me, where I am, and the world we are in. The world I move my feet through. The atmosphere I breathe is thick like syrup, twenty seven layers thick. I'm wading through the world, consumed with... consumed.

I'm wading through the swamp that my body has become. Trackmarks, what a beautiful expression. Trailmarks. I am blazing new trails all over my body in the search for virgin rivers that will carry me home to glacial happiness, to Arctic oceans of narcosis... But I dredge the river with my giant harpoon until they wither and die. Gouge the rivers into rubble.

My arms are like two bricks, there is no sensation of flexibility at all. Holes everywhere I can barely clench a fist and throw a punch, I can barely straighten my crook. it will go away, but it's never pleasant.

Today I found a new vein - hooray! As each vein collapses I have to look for smaller and smaller ones. A vicious cycle forms: the size of the needle rips apart the tiny veins after one or two hits, setting in motion the search for other (smaller) veins, which in turn are damaged just as quickly. I am swollen like a balloon though I feel like a block of cement. And nothing like a vein in sight.

In the end, I won't have veins, just some kind of trinkle system, my tired blood spreading itself through tissue and skin,around bone loosened from cartilage, drip drip drip into calcified cavities...

Look, I am so fucking tired. But I have to ignore that and hardly sleep and scar my brain even in dreams and wake up tomorrow. Still, how can I think of the future when,I can't even remember the past. Really when we're nodded out, we're still running.",1473582097.0

Back story: 
I've been an addict for about a year now. Before the opiate addiction, I was a smoker for roughly 6 years  I quite almost 2 years ago. Shortly after I quit, I started taking Modafinil as a way to get through long work days and still have time for school.  Never had full access to it so I went looking for OTC alternatives which lead me to Adrafinil. I felt like I needed it to function. Looking back, I realize why I felt I ""needed"" it so badly. It masked some deep depression and extreme anxiety that quitting smoking uncovered. 

I dabbled in the ""nootropic"" scene for a while and shortly after discovered Tianeptine. I remember reading reviews warning of opiate withdrawal and addiction but did the classic, ""that wouldn't happen to me,"" line. I filled the capsules myself, right at the recommended dosage. I loved it. It took care of my social anxiety, made me happy, and motivated me. It was a Godsend. I took it responsibly for about a month.  Each time, I filled them less and less carefully. Each time I slowly increased the amount- unintentionally. I remember the first time I experienced the high. I thought it was the combination of Modafinil and Tianeptine that left me with a rush of euphoria. (Later on realize it had nothing to do with the Modafinil). I was hooked. 

I ignorantly became an addict. I say ignorantly because I knew the risks... I just didn't think it could happen to me.  Each time the amount of powder I put in each capsule increased. This went on for a year. I'd rather not say the dosage I was at when I hit ""rock bottom"" because it was a lot.  More than I've seen any one admit to on here. I was working 10-12 hours a day, 5 days a week AND going to school full time. It was killing me.  It was so bad that I woke up 2 times every night to dose.  I don't remember much from Jan-May of this year. I was out of it 90% of the time. Thank GOD I graduated in May after 6 years. I told myself that once I graduated, I was quitting my job, and detoxing. Well, I never had the chance. 

A few months ago I had an accident and broke my hip.  Was taken by ambulance to the hospital. They pumped me full of fentanyl but never felt it. The EMT was in shock that he administered 3 doses and I wasn't reacting to it. After my blood pressure refused to go down, and me asking when I was going to get pain medication, he gave me the 3rd round. I was unaware they had even given it to me. I was not about to reveal that I was an addict.  I'm that person no one would ever guess was an addict. I've hid it successfully this entire time, I was not about to give it up now. 

We get to the hospital and they try Dilaudid- no luck either.  They gave me so much pain medication, they had to have someone monitor my stats 24/7 to make sure I stayed conscious. The funny thing was, I was more sober than I had been in months. Nothing they gave me had any effect. I never felt any of it. I even was set up with a pain pump before I had emergency surgery. The only relief I had was when they administered the anesthesia. When I woke up from surgery, I was virtually sober. The pain was something I could never forget. My tolerance was so high, they couldn't manage the pain at all. I was in ICU for a few days and still had the 24/7 nurse to make sure my heart didn't stop-that's how much I was given. The doctors couldn't figured out why/how I was still awake and conscious.  I don't think they ever caught on. My boyfriend did inform  the anesthesiologist right before surgery that I took tianeptine for depression only because it effected the type of anesthesia he used. He didn't seem concerned. 

They started weaning me off the pain pump and lower my pain meds so for days I was not only in excruciating pain from a broken hip and having plates and screws drilled in my body, I was also going through withdrawal. We saw this as a great detox opportunity though. I had my boyfriend throw out all paraphernalia and about $450 worth of unused Tianeptine. I figured being in the hospital was the perfect excuse. I was safe, tapering down, and best of all, no one knew.  

Two weeks post op, I went home with a script of 60 10mg Oxys, 10 a day. I was still experiencing withdrawals with that dosage but after a while, it became tolerable.  I was then cut back to 8, 10mg oxy's a day. I turned it into a competition to see how long I could go. I was able to get down to 6 a day and shortly after than, 4 a day. After about a month though, my surgeon referred me out to a pain management facility- a good one. He didn't know I had already cut back. So I went to see the pain management and they put me on 10mg Percocets, every 6 hours and added Gabapentin to it. I went back and he lowered it to 10mg, every 8 hours. The last time I saw them they decreased it to 7.5mg Percocets, every 6 hours. 

Because I was able to take less than they prescribe, I'm able to treat myself every so often with doubling up or even tripling. Right now, my dosage is I can take one 7.5 Percocet every 6 hours. (I also asked him to lower my dosage because I do eventually want to be sober. I also don't want them to label me drug seeker, even though I might as well be. I find myself taking an a extra one here and there and I can feel it getting bad again. 

When I took the Tianeptine, I was waking up atleast twice every night to dose because of the pain.  I haven't found any accounts of what I feel. Within a few hours of taking my last Tianeptine dose, my body would get a rush of heat. I felt like my blood was boiling and my skin just hurt. I still have that. When I'm reaching that .5-1 hour before its time for anther, I feel sick. The restless legs are ungodly. 

I wanted to give a background as to what my dosages are and other factors. Does that happen to anyone else? I feel like shit-""restless legs"" feeling throughout my whole body, intense ""blood boiling"" feeling, and painful skin, like you get with the flu, only hours after taking a Percocet. 

Is what I'm experiencing, beginning of withdrawal or midway? Does it happen that quickly to anyone else?  Getting withdrawals only house after taking one? I feel so alone in this because it's so painful.  I'm so uncomfortable. I can't sit still. It hurts.please tell me I'm not alone. 

Thanks for listening to me rant to get to my question ð
TL:Dr: addicted and abused Tianeptine. Broke my hip and found out my tolerance was incredibly high.   Quit Tianeptine cold turkey since I was in the hospital. Anytime I miss a dose or its close to dosing time, my blood starts to boil and skin hurts, with terrible restless ""legs"" all over. Cut myself way down to 7.5mg-4 times a day as opposed to 10mg-10 times a day. Is it common for these feelings, and this soon?

Edit- I should also mention that I'm a month away from 25, and female. Not sure if it makes a difference though. 

Edit 2- I tore my ACL one year ago where my real dependency started. I was prescribed 10mg oxycodone 6x a day. When I tried to quit, I realized I was physically dependent.  Shortly after I found that increasing doses of Tianeptine was much better than the Oxy. It spiraled down hill from there. ",1473576895.0

I knew about the potential dangers, so I was very conservative with my doses (1 mg of Xanax and .1 of H). To make a long story short, I didn't like it at all.
First of all I can barely remember anything from the 5 hours after I got high. All I recall is laying down and intermittently falling asleep and waking up. Aside from the roughly 3 hours that I spent sound asleep, I was sitting in my chair and nodding off every 10 seconds. But it wasn't the pleasant, euphoric nod I usually get from opiates, it was more like quickly falling asleep. (Does that even make sense?) It was  far less enjoyable than an opiate nod.

I most likely won't be doing this again. In a way I'm glad I didn't like it, because it can be quite dangerous.

Also, I was planning to detox this weekend, but fucked that up by getting high last night and this morning. However, I still want to get clean, so I've come up with a plan to taper down over the next several days and detox next weekend. Then hopefully I can stay clean for a couple months, because I really need to get my shit together.

It was strong, that's for sure. I leaned my head against the dashboard of my car and began to doze off, needle still in hand. The last thing I remember is feeling my husband take the needle from my hand and not having the energy to open my eyes. I was going on 48 hours of no sleep at this point. What happened next, I'm not sure, so I will tell what I was told.

My husband, thinking I was only in a nod, left to grab something from store, 3 minutes tops. When he got back, he realised I hadn't moved and tried shaking me awake. Then he realised I wasn't breathing. He began frantically searching the car for the Narcan, but, probably due to his hysteria and being high, he couldn't find it. He dumped water on me, also to no avail. At that point, he pulled me out of the car onto the ground and attempted CPR. A woman driving by stopped to help - she was a nurse. She continued CPR while my husband called 911. He then left the scene due to a warrant he has. The woman continued CPR for 5 minutes before I got a pulse and took a breath. I remember sitting up and seeing her face, then the firetruck, then the EMT telling me I had overdosed, and I began crying and hyperventilating. How could this have happened??

I tried to refuse transport, but they convinced me to go get monitored. They asked me the basic questions, which I knew all the answers. I began nodding off again on the way to the hospital and the EMT kept shaking me awake. I remember climbing into the hospital bed, them taking my vitals and me asking to call my husband, but the nurse didn't have the code to make a long distance call - no one did. I had no way to get a hold of him. Then a blur of doctors in and out. Them telling me not to fall asleep, and me telling the nurse I couldn't stay awake. Please help me stay awake. I'm falling asleep. And I did.

I woke up to someone putting something on my face, and I started grabbing at it. I couldn't see. It was an oxygen mask. Wait, what's happening? My head HURTS. I can't see or hear. Someone tells me I fell asleep, and they had to give me medicine to wake me up. I ask if it was Narcan. It was. I start yelling at the nurse for letting me fall asleep when I begged her not to (I later apologized to her - she was great). Fuck, everything HURTS. I'm going to puke. I look around and suddenly everyone's gone, and the door is closed. The monitor is beeping - my heart rate and blood pressure are through the roof. I can't breathe. I'm in a weird state of extreme panic. I know I'm awake and my eyes are open, but the image isn't connecting with my brain. I'm so disoriented. I can't breathe! Someone help me! Why did everyone leave?! They don't know I'm dying!! Where is my husband?? I keep taking breaths of the oxygen, and start talking myself through it. I'm not dying. I'm in a hospital. They gave me Narcan, and this is normal. How long will this last? Where is the call button? I just want someone to talk to me!

It was the most terrifying thing I've ever experienced. Eventually, the Narcan wore off, and I started to calm down. My husband found me just by taking the bus to random hospital's. He came in then and sat with me. They wouldn't release me until they were sure the H was out of my system. Some of the nurses gave me a lot of attitude even though I was just trying to go along with everything, but my doctor was super nice. I asked for Tylenol for my headache and was told I couldn't have anymore and ""that's what happens when you do drugs"". I finally got released about 1 AM. I haven't fully wrapped my head around it yet. It might be no big deal for some people, but for me, I feel like this is a wake up call. I could have died. I did die. My chest is extremely sore from the CPR, and I feel like complete ass. I don't know what to feel or think at this point. But I know I'm done with dope, at least for now. 

TL;DR - Overdosed, CPR, hospital, fell asleep, Narcan freak out, got released with no issues, existential crisis",1473536282.0

Hope everyone's dopeman just picked up some fire new powder and yall are nodding and feeling some Saturday love. would write about this on bluelight but I'm a pretty well known member and meet ups are against the rules and generally frowned upon. Another reason why you guys have quickly became an awesome new replacement. We really do have an amazing community here. But fuck all that, I got a new private message notification on my Samsung last night...

... Dude is messaging me asking if I'm still in South Florida ... 

..  I say yes, we exchange numbers, he ends up driving to my apartment to chill with me and my girlfriend and was there with plenty of cash in ten minutes. 

Taking the risk of meeting someone for the first time always carries a miniature thrill of danger for me: double when there's drugs involved. That being said, I encourage everyone to do their research as thoroughly as possible prior to meeting face to face with anyone. The kid ended up BEING awesome as hell though. He was my age and slangs trees, subs, and addies and wanted me to help him facilitate a planned break from his subs with fire dope. Normally I wouldn't help someone in recovery relapse, but this kid was still getting high besides subs and had plenty of them left as a safety blanket. He was gonna get high with or without my help. 

He was very concerned with quality and didn't want any dangerous ECP cut with fent. I told him I was the right man for the job.

... We've gone and picked up 0.6g of the firest chunky, clumpy quality dope twice since last night. He was ecstatic I could find such seemingly uncut shit and I didn't step on it or rip him off at all. 

... I got him a clean point and we shot up with my girl at my crib. With what he generously hooked me up with for middling and the little we made my girl and I both got a point. 

... He throws me a fat sack of bud and a Narcan auto injector device on the house. 


So anyway guys just wanted to share about how meeting a friend off bluelight really worked out. Its safer to meet people that are members of prominent forums because you can research their post history and get a decent idea of what they're about before the time comes. You always gotta worry about police, but 99/100 times if a cops really tryna set you up over the internet, he's gonna be on Craigslist. It's hard for me to imagine someone in law enforcement making 150 posts about IV subs over a year's time span to go and bust a random member over a gram. 

This kid was really cool. Genuinely a good person and very generous. He understood harm reduction to the T and really had me crediting bluelight for all the amazing information that's being shared in there. Him giving me a narcan rig was really fucking cool of him. Down here they're still pretty expensive and no where near as readily available as they should be. Thanked him twice for that one. 

I told him about this place and showed him how much cooler than BL it is in that it's more relaxed and you get to see everyone's crazy dope porn pics. Guess the moral of all this is that if you're careful and a little adventurous good people are still out there. Rarely there's even one or two in the game. 


TLDR; Met an awesome kid online over bluelight and had an awesome time banging dope and talking HR ",1473534934.0

Seeing as how there's no good legal opioids left now, I've decided to forfeit any attempts to keep my substance use within the law.

I know heroin is a pretty cost efficient way to get high, but the 10 panel drug tests my employer requires his peons to take will show it in my system for sure. 

Even though they're cheap too and probably won't show up on a 10 panel test that only looks for morphine based opioids, fentanyl based drugs are out of the question as they have only ever given me extreme sedation with almost no euphoria, not to mention they're too dangerous for my liking. I've only ever tried pharma grade fentanyl and acetyl fentanyl and I hated them both, but I've heard decent things about FU fentanyl. Is it any better than the fentanyls I've had experience with?

I've never tried it, but from what I've heard methadone gives a satisfactory level of euphoria and, being a synthetic opioid, won't show up on a 10 panel drug tests but, like all other prescription opioids, it's too damn expensive where I've seen it.

This may sound retarded, but if I used heroin how hard would it be to just make the case that I really like poppy seed bagels? Also, I have a prescription for diphenoxylate/atropine because of my severe ulcerative colitis, so if I got a positive for opioids could I just say it was because of that? I know diphenoxylate is closely related to demerol, but iirc demerol is a synthetic opioid that wouldn't show on a drug test in the first place so I don't think that would work.

Is there any other opioid out there I could use? I've been fortunate enough to someone who can be a responsible opioid user, as in the past 2 and a half years I've been using hydrocodone, demerol, morphine, kratom, fentanyl analogues, oxycodone, and U-47700 and not once gone into withdrawal. It wouldn't be the end of the world for me if I had to drastically cut back on my opioid use, but I'd really rather it not come to that.

One more thing, the only ROAs I can ever bring myself to use are oral and intranasally, so I'd prefer an opioid that has decent bioavailability via those routes. I'd be willing to smoke something too, but anything involving needles or sticking something up my ass is out of the question. 

So unless someone can help me out and suggest something better, it looks like my only options are demerol, tianeptine and methadone. Tianeptine's pretty shit though IME. I've never bought demerol or methadone; Which one is usually cheaper?

Just to be clear, not asking for sources, just typical prices. I read the rules before I made this post and as far as I can tell asking about prices in general isn't against the rules, but if it is, please go easy on me mods.

Any advice from more experienced users would be greatly appreciated.

Edit: I don't have a reputation as a drug seeker, so my gastroenterologist once told me that if my ulcerative colitis symptoms worsen that he might give me a low dose of codeine instead of diphenoxylate for the pain and diarrhea. I know codeine and heroin are morphine based, so if I used heroin and got a positive for opiates on a drug test, could I just blame it on the codeine and not have them do further testing to see which opiate was in my system? I had a friend freshman year at Uni who used rc amphetamines while on probatation for a dui, but he had an Adderall prescription so even though he tested positive for amphetamines, they didn't do further testing to be sure it was just the Adderall that gave the positive.",1473691912.0

They were supportive, and I told them I wanted to try an at home, cold turkey detox, at their house.

I took some time off work, as did my girlfriend. We tried to not use, and went to meetings every day. We also saw a therapist. But we kept fucking up. I had already lost my car, and in this time, we blew a coolant line on my girl's car. It got to the point with my family where they said if I fucked up again, not to come home unless I'd go to rehab.

Well, we couldn't do it. So, four and a half weeks ago I took some money and got me and my girl into the city. We knew we were about to be homeless, as neither of us were willing to go to rehab. We still left completely unprepared. We had the clothes on our back. We proceeded to hang with the other homeless people, panhandle, fly signs, and basically accept our new lifestyle.

Anyways, we found a methadone clinic that would take us on Wednesday. So Thursday, my girl and I started methadone. Its been amazing. Its like a miracle drug. And the methadone doctor is a psychiatrist. And the fee includes everything, including psychiatric care. So we will be working on ourselves. And we're living with my girls mom now. My parents held the insurance money from my wrecked car, so I will be getting a new motorcycle on Thursday, once I've demonstrated to my family that I can be successful on methadone 

But I called up an old friend today. Someone who I had started getting into drugs with in high school. We both experimented with all substances. But he told me he got a promotion with a raise. He's now lead technician at the shop where he works. He said he make $4900 per paycheck after taxes. That should be me. I'm smarter than him, not to be conceited. This is what heroin has taken from me and my life. I could be making $120,000/yr, in a trade that I love, providing for my family. But instead, I'm now unemployed, and my girl is going back to work at a shitty pizza place tomorrow. But at least we're alive and making positive change. It just sucks to see it in that perspective 

Tl;Dr - I came forward to my family about my use. Tried to go cold turkey. Couldn't. Got kicked out. Lived on the street for a month with my girl. Found a methadone clinic to take us.

My luck it would be arsenic ð Anyway, I know the opiate scene around here and it's nearly non existent. Sure I can find my pills, but it's a lot of effort and very, very hard to do. Even in my younger years before the responsibilities of motherhood, I have never seen or even heard of anyone doing H. And I ran with a rough crowd once upon a time. I'm sure there could be some around though. It's in a beautiful metallic blue/turquoise capsule and it an off white powdery substance. What do y'all think? I'm a daily user but nothing heavy, so I'm not sure I want to test it further. For all I know it could be fentanyl and I would od. Is there some way to test it? Help!!!",1473654035.0

We've been doing these Question of the Day's for a hot minute, and I know I've had a recent dip in quality. For this I apologize, but it also opens the door for some improvements, so I'm asking for feedback! First, the main question is this: what would make these better? 

What do you want me to ask questions about? What do you not like about the QotD? What *do* you like about the QotD? Do you like the everyday format (except for when I drop the ball)? Do you prefer story based questions or simpler answer questions? How personal do you want the questions? How would you get more discussion going? Do you hate them altogether? Do you hate me altogether? As always of course, why? 

Also, when I'm on top of things, I do these around midnight my time so they'll be up all day. How do you guys like this? Would you prefer them posted at a different time? Is everyday good for you or would you prefer less frequent? 

Any and all feedback is appreciated, even a simple ""good job"" or ""Fuck you"" works! I'm back on the needle so I'm around the subreddit more often again, meaning I should be back on top of the Question of the Days. Can't wait to hear your ideas and feedback, and Happy Nodding! ",1473649545.0

I got a new job that's entry-level rather than managing because I haven't worked in a minute and I don't want to jump into something super stressful. 

I'm grateful for this job and a friend help me get it. I had actually trained her years ago at a previous place. All the other jobs I applied for looked at me like I was crazy because I went from making a lot of money and managing to applying for an entry-level job that pays ok just so I didn't have to deal with stress and have that much responsibility. I want to start out kind of slow, then once I'm ready to start taking on more responsibility and move up. 

I own a house but I'll be moving to a different city so I'm renting it out until it sells. It's been for sell for quite some time so I hope it gets sold soon. Until then I'll be renting a room so I can save some money and still put a little to the house. 

Usually changes like this kind of send me either in a good direction or bad hole. *How do you guys manage for change like this or big changes in life? Things can be stressful which usually means more use.*

He has a bad back, knees and legs due to 1) accident in his youth 2) manual labor for many years of his life. He has been on disability insurance for years. His pain management doc recently put him on suboxone and he said he felt much better when he was on it and I noticed a huge difference in his coherence. Apparently his insurance(disability) did not cover it for long (the details here are sketchy since it's coming from him) ""forcing"" him to go back to vicodin. I have a health condition myself and do not make enough money to have regular insurance and am on Medi-cal (CA Medicaid) and it covers my very expensive drugs. I feel confused about why he can't stay on suboxone and a little lost trying to navigate the Medicaid/Medicare/disability healthcare options trying to find a way for him to get him coverage he needs to stay off of narcotics. Additionally, he has low testosterone which causes low bone density which intensifies the pain that caused him to be on opiates in the first place. When he has his RX for testosterone he has less pain and seems to be better about managing his addiction.

Mass shipments have hit my location on the west coast. Up to 5 orders of magnitude more potent than Morphine.,"If you have not nodded out before you have reached the bottom of this post I applaud you. 2 or 3 hours ago I said I was gonna write a quick reddit post....

For those of you who have your heads buried under a pillow or on a constant nod please read this with an open mind if you can open your eyes. I've 'been' a junkie for 15 years. I got clean last year but most of my friends, the ones that are left, are not clean so I still run the circles indirectly. Do what you do just be safe. I'm on the methadone clinic keeping a lowish dose of 130MG. I will not go past this. Been on it for 13 months.

Not all junkies are the same and not all heroin users are junkies. I firmly believe there are what some of us call the 1%ers. I am not one of these. A 1 percenter is able to dose his or herself 2 or 3 times a day and maintain a job, friends, working relationships, and live life as if nothing has changed. Except for the obvious feeling better. These 1 percenters will quite before it takes over their life and they know they are on the tip of a knife's edge thus are always making sure they are properly prioritized and keeping shit maintained. Again, I am NOT one of these. I didn't and couldn't do any of this shit BEFORE I was on dope so when I started I soon after became a junkie. Homeless for over a decade at only 28 years old right now. I had a place to live within weeks of getting clean. I am a freelance web developer as I have been for years so I could still maintain work as a junkie but that was it. 

The point is, be safe I don't wanna come off preachy but this new shit is deadly. I have lost 4 friends this past 3 months. The last one died in my arms in the back seat of shitty ass car on the way to the hospital last night. (why I'm writing this) Needles, caps, stoppers, cookers, foils, baggies, and everything around me in the seats, the floors, everywhere. I administered Narcan and CPR multiple times. The hospital was 20 minutes away traveling 90 on the interstate. I performed CPR till I could no longer lift my arms. The paramedics took over at this point as we had also just arrived at a hospital just outside of Oakland/San Francisco. She was DOA. It was this new dope. The bag was marked ""Joplin"". The news media is talking about one of these new types called ""Hollywood"". It appears the ""Hollywood"" and the ""SacTown"" has made it to Akron Ohio. 2 dozen+ overdoses reported last I checked 

The dope to watch out for are in your typical folded wax bags or wax like paper that is basically a Goody's like paper. Each dealer folds their shit and stacks it differently but the names are what matters. ""Joplin"", ""UrsaMajor"", ""Hollywood"", ""Frisco"", ""SacTown"", ""NorCal"", ""SoCal"", and some other CA relevant names as well as some Asian significant names. Asia being where it is coming from. Presumably.

Everyone in California is going crazy over this new dope that suddenly sprung up last month. As most of you know, if you are on the west coast or midwest, typically the ones on the street selling the dope are the ""Hondos"". And it's typically Tar, sometimes gunpowder, or the occasional fake china white that's real heroin but with fentanyl packaged as China. 

A lot of people are saying ""OMG fentanyl is in the heroin and it's killing people."" that's always been the case. Sometimes it just springs up around people who are not used to it. For instance. When you throw high-grade heroin into a small country town where everyone has a pain pill habit because rarely does anyone have heroin. Even if your shooting 200MG a day of Oxy. Roughly 7 Roxy 30s a day. That's not shit compared to this new shit. Hell 200MGs of oxy a day is not even comparable to good CLEAN and REAL heroin.  Someone just happens to be in Cali from Akron Ohio when the dope hit the street and when they went home (presumably this is how it happened) they took some with them. Quite a bit it would seem. 

Gone is the day of worrying about fentanyl, though. This new shit has Etro, Ohmefentanyl, and Carfentanil as well as other analogs and isos of each and others. Some of these are on the scale of 3-4 orders of magnitude more potent than morphine. Some 2 -3  orders of magnitude more potent than their initial derivative fentanyl itself. That is mind-bogglingly potent. For example, something that is 2 orders of magnitude stronger is 100 times stronger.  Something that is 3 orders of magnitude stronger is 1000 times stronger, and something that is 6 orders of magnitude stronger is one million times stronger. Pure china white is in the minor leagues in comparison to this dope. It's not even dope really. It's only got a small bit of heroin in it.

I live in LA with a friend and have my own place in San Francisco. A camper. Work requires me to be in both cities quite a bit. Well, this past month in LA, the streets have been flooded with none tar dope. All the way from San Diego/TJ heading north out of Norcal into Oregon/Portland and starting to die off in Seattle. Only had one friend who knows two or three dealers with it in Seattle. In Portland, it was a little more prominent but still not as much as Cali.

Now between Socal, Norcal, and even Washington State, the streets are absolutely littered with this shit. So all of that being said above, this is how some situations unfold. Pill head starts to withdraw and hits the streets looking for some Percocet (Oxy) and finds this heroin instead. Someone tells him it's cheaper. Only $10 - $20 for a bag vs a dollar a millie for some oxy. He weighs it out in his head. He's got $50 bucks. So he can buy 5  10mg per or 2-5 bags of this heroin he always heard good things about but never wanted to try. In the end, they almost always do so he buys it cause he's sick. Dealer tells him he doesn't need to shot it. that he can snort it so he tells himself it's ok just this time. Why not. He goes home and to himself, he thinks ""well I've been on pills a long time and I have a bad habit. I can eat  10-20 perc 5s in a few hours"" So he tells himself he will do just 1 bag to be safe. He thinks about doing only half a bag but does not want to waste it cause he may not feel it and then half do even more to get high and he's sick as shit anyway by now. So he does just one bag to be safe. He snorts it. He lays back to see how it feels. It kicks in in just a few minutes. He likes it. Enjoys it. He turns on some music and closes his eyes.... they never open again.

Morphine is way more potent than some 5 millie percs. This guy thought he had a high tolerance. He was not opiate educated. While his oxy tolerance and pill tolerance were high compared to grandma, who takes 5 mg percs 3 times a daily and is comatose afterward, what he just snorted was on the order of thousands and thousands of times stronger. Morphine is insanely more potent than percs and Fentanyl is 10,000x-18,000x more potent than morphine. That's just Fentanyl. This new shit is yet an order or two more potent still than Fentanyl. He had no chance. 

I'll close this out now. Put simply; this new stuff is almost 100,000x times more potent than anything you've done.

Remember this and there is no reason why you should overdose. You can always do MORE but you absolutely can NOT do LESS. Don't be a junkie. Or at least be an educated junkie. Try a little bit. when we are talking 4 orders of magnitude potency 1 bag is not a little bit. IF there is a possibility that what you have in your hand is the strongest shit you have ever done by x100k, and it is obviously possible, put 50 units on the 1 bag and do 5 units. Do 10 more. Give consideration to the creep delay. May take time. At that point, you will know how strong the dope is. If 5 units of a 50 unit 1 bag shot are too much you are fucking with some potent dope. The new shit. 

I lost my friend this past night because she was sick, shaking and impatient which is not like her but brought on by sickness, and she didn't want to try it first. She always tries it if it's a new person or from the street. She didn't this time. If I had known prior I would not have let her do it. From the moment she hit and went into a nod till the moment, she was in full respiratory depression and not breathing was less than a minute. She was out in 20 seconds and her breathing was stopped 40 seconds later. This is approximate. She didn't even get the needle out of her arm before she passed out. It was like watching some get hit with IV valium to knock them out. Asphyxia. Suffocation. This is how she died. Typically these are the worst ways to die if you are conscious. while I hate to use the word in this case luckily she wasn't so she felt no pain. I just wonder if in that those first few seconds, the first 5 or 10 which were simultaneously her last if she knew she had done too much. If she was able to have a single coherent thought about what was about to happen. She was smart. Everyone can fuck up.

TL;DR Lost a friend to this new dope, please be safe. It's mostly in California but it's spreading. Remember You can always do MORE but you absolutely can NOT do LESS. This new dope (not really dope; only has a little bit of heroin in it) is orders of magnitude (10's of thousands to 100s of thousands of times more potent than morphine and regular grade street dope.) This dope will spread fast across America. Please be safe.

Anyone else?,"So, I've been a whole month without pills, I used to take pills a lot, maybe not as much as some of the posters in this sub my favorite were Hydrocodone. I used to take up to 80~100 mg a day, it all went to shit creek one day, that is a story for another day, ever since then I've been trying to stay clean, I have been on and off on Suboxone since July, taking some pills here and now then.

But now for the last month I've been strictly on Suboxone, celexa and meloxicam, the one thing I noticed it is that now all my poop is at the [Type 2 on the Bristo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/BristolStoolChart.png)l scale it hurts and my ass hole bleeds almost every time I take a shit.

Now, this never really happened on pills, I only had this happen twice while taking pills, before I was hooked I my pops were on the Type 6 on the bristol scale and I was going up to 3~4 times a day possibly due to an undiagnosed IBS condition I never really had a solid poop before I was hooked.

While on pills my movements became more predictable and solid, but now that I am on Suboxone they are hard as shit and only once a day, it is a bit uncomfortable, but I don't want to take laxatives since I don't want to over do it and go back to my creammy poops. 

My diet has remanned largely unchanged, but I would like to have more comfortable poops, I only wish that my poop would lube it self, but I guess I could start doing some X-Lax or something similar, but mostly I just wanted to vent on how my movements changed from going to pills to Suboxone and finding out that Suboxone, personally, makes constipation much worse.

tl;dr My shits are like this http://i.imgur.com/AO89kKU.jpg now that I am on Suboxone.

I am, however going to share with you an anecdote from my day yesterday. 

I'm a certified EMT.  I frequently get calls to OD's, and it's a simple procedure if it's in the hands of professionals who know how to treat the situation.  Yesterday i went for my daily run at a local park.  I noticed some weird things, but put it on hold before i jumped to conclusions.  

2 Laps after passing a girl face down on a bench with some guy sitting next to her casually, i asked if she was okay.  He responds with 

""Oh yeah, she's breathing.  She's okay"" 

I stopped and looked at him.  He was shaking, he was fumbling through a small blue bag.  He was in a panic, and i knew something was up.  I approched and began my assessment.  He began to cry.  

She was completly unconscious.  Hardly breathing.  This girl had OD'd on whatever they were using.  He began talking about how ""The narcan wont work!"" I looked at it, and he had it assembled completely ass backwards, in fact, i dont even know what he did, but he was pressing the nasal cap into her leg and motioning to me like WTF IT DOESNT WORK. I asked what she was using, he said he didn't know.  I asked if it was heroin, he said he didn't know.  I know the telltale signs of opiate OD, and there was no question.

I told him to call 911, and give me the Narcan so i can administer it. He refused, said no way, he can't call 911.  I conscripted a couple kids on their bikes to do so, as they stood on in horror watching the unconscious husk of a person lay on a bench no more than 20 ft from them.  

I assembled the Narcan, and administered it.  30 seconds later, she was conscious, talking, and hysterical.  I don't know how long she was out for, or what exactly she had on board, but seeing her eyes look into my soul coming up, i had a very upsetting realization.  

What if i hadn't gone for my run, and gotten involved.  How long would her boyfriend have sat there not knowing what to do before calling for help?  Would he have called? This girl could have died.  

I know each of you make your own choices every day.  I'm not going to sit here and pretend to know what you go through, and preach how bad drugs are, mmkay? What i want you to take from this, is knowing that just because you HAVE narcan, it doesn't mean OD's aren't dangerous.  

If you OD at a park, and your boyfriend, friend or whatever doesn't know what they are doing...you know what could happen.  If they don't call an ambulance in that situation, what's going to happen?    Lets say you do know, and you get them up.  They aren't cured.  you have about 30 minutes before they could slip back in.  Narcan is a TEMPORARY thing. 

Learn to use it, it's not just common sense, it's something you need to familiarize yourself with.  If not for you, for your friend who's in danger.  ",1473611888.0

Have had pretty strong heroin habit for about 2 years (on and off but on much more than off) using anywhere from .25-1g a day. A couple days after July 4th I got clean and relapsed on heroin once on July 21st. I relapsed in large part for pain relief as I had a badly herniated disc. 

I avoided the hydrocodone I was prescribed for quite some time but started taking 30mg a day (15 in the morning 15 at night) about 4 days ago. FWIW I had almost no pain relief from these low doses. I had my surgery last night and it went well but I am in a lot of pain atm.

I was prescribed 60 perc 5s and had the following questions: 

1. How many percs would I take to get some substantial pain relief? 

2. How many percs would I take to get a decent buzz? 

3. Does anyone have any advice for how to break the 60 down over time? 

FWIW I have given the pills to someone more responsible than I am- but if we agree to a schedule it shouldn't be a problem to get the dose I need. ",1473779234.0

(Strict facility)","Okay so far I'm getting her a framed picture of her dog, art supplies a letter. The letter can't imply that we are in a relationship, as dating is highly frowned upon in the first year of recovery. So if there's a picture in me in the there it Has to seem like im her cousin or something. Anyway it is a 6 month program with no visiting except once at Christmas which no doubtedly would be the case . 

Anyway she's an amazing  artist so the art supplies were a no brainer. Same with the dog. Luckily she snuck her phone inside so we have been texting every night (so thankful). This is a pretty hardcore and strict facility from what she says, so she doesn't even know exactly what I can I can't send her. Throw some ideas out there I'd love to hear from you!

Side note?; During our last goodbye.. she said "" you have the green light from me to hook up with other girls while I'm away, I would hate be in your position.""

I had no intention of this never even crossed my mind. To me she is the most awesome person I've ever met and she also happens to be extremely gorgeous, so that's a plus. The problem is that she is the only girl that even  remotely interests, we've been in love I'd say since this past January. Bottom line i can go 6 months without punani, especially for this woman. No problem.

But by her saying that does that mean she doesnt take our relationship as serious as I do? I hope she would do the same thing if our roles were reserved. Guess im skeptical because she met a guy in a different rehab like a year before we met. But apparently that rehab was like a resort and this new one is more like a prison.



I'm 22 (M) she is 27 (F) we met may 2015 and live about 45 min drive from each other. Usually spend the weekend together every week. (3 nights, 2 days) I trust her even though everytime we go somewhere  guys are always checking her out and trying to talk to her. I'm not jealous, she just knows she can get any guy she wants 

Gonna be up all night so I'm open to any questions or comments.

Thank you .

My mother has only told me that he does coke apparently. If she knows of his drug use I'm about to get to, then she must think I'm stupid. She's highly against acid, shrooms, etc. she doesn't know that I'm decently versed in substance use.

About a week and a half ago, I found out that two old friends of mine are leaving my province. Aside from being sad they were leaving, I was also in a panic upon realizing how long it had been since I bought oxycodone off of anybody else.

So of course, I go through my phone and Facebook contacts, messaging every person I've ever gotten high with over the years. Of course, I was getting reply after reply of people saying ""I quit, sorry"", or ""I only do (insert shit tier opiate here)"". I was about to give up when a friend of mine who doesn't even use opiates contacts me about a guy she knows.

Sure enough, I meet him and he's probably the easiest guy to deal with I've ever had. The guy whips out what I want along with a bunch of pills I'd either never seen, or didn't think anyone had here. It's all real too, as I learned over the weekend.

Of course, now it's Monday, so I'm back on my best behavior. Sitting at my cubicle typing this in my last few minutes of work.

I went from being a complete fuck up who constantly struggled with depression, ADD, and anxiety, to finishing out my BS with a 4.0GPA, getting a great job, and getting married to a wonderful woman, all while keeping my dosage consistent.  

I also experimented with U4 earlier this year, and I guess it being so much stronger than kratom, really lit a fire under my ass at work for a while.  Now these DEA fuckers are taking both of these legal options away.  Fortunately I don't have to worry about drug tests, and am well versed in DNMs, so virtually any opiod is an option.

It really hasn't been too hard to be honest. Don't get me wrong, it's sucked, but I was expecting it to be MUCH harder. Yes, it's dragged out compared to something like dope withdrawal, but I would much rather go through this. 

  The only physical symptoms I have left are: Insomnia (FUCK, I'm getting maybe 5 hours of sleep a night, split up), sneezing (annoying as hell sneezing 20 times+ a day), chills sometimes, temperature fluctuation, non solid poop but not diarrhea 6+ times a day, and lethargy. The first week was the hardest, and it's just gotten progressively better. 

  I look at sub detox videos online and read other's peoples' experiences coming off of suboxone and they seem like they have a pretty hard time with depression and cravings at this point, both of which I really don't have. I know I'm not immune, but it's just not happening. I feel ""weird"", but not depressed, but honestly that's expected. As for cravings, of course I think about dope and subs (it was a part of my life for 4+ years), but to go as far as wanting to use, I honestly have no desire to. I have been working out really hard for the last two weeks, eating really well, and have been using a bunch of supplements people recommend taking for opiate withdrawal, so that could be it. Am i just lucky in this aspect? Someone have any ideas why this is? I'm not complaining, that's for sure! Just curious. I know I'm definitely not done, and I know I have a lot more to go through. 

  CHANGES I have mentally, besides the fatigue/lethargy, I feel pretty great mentally. A bit bored, but that's expected. While on subs I had the attitude of ""whatever, fuck that. I don't care."" whenever I think about what led me to my using, etc... But now that I'm off, I actually DO care. And I accept what has happened, and I'm fine with it. I'm only going to move forward from it, and I'm excited to do so. The future is looking really bright. Never have felt this way in the past 4 years and it's a good feeling.

  Opiates and SUBS depress the hell out of you and make you not care about shit in my experience. Subs helped me immensely, but something just clicked a couple of months ago and I knew I was ready to be done with this. I didn't want to live life by being content with being complacent. If any of you are on suboxone and are scared to get off because of the withdrawal, you CAN do it, and you'll feel so much better that you did do it. Yeah, it sucks, but it's definitely doable. Just look up a taper plan and follow through with it. If you need help, feel free to PM me.

  I love this sub, and all of the support it's given me over the years. I can easily say this is the best, most supportive community on reddit. So, thanks you guys. I love all of you, and hope you can be happy with whatever you choose to do. 

  If anyone wants, I can make a detailed post about my experience coming off subs and a timeline of the physical/mental symptoms, and what supplements I'm currently taking.

While my cravings were high, fear of the off chance of getting caught of being extremely unlucky at the wrong place at the wrong time has kept me in line all those times when I wanted to say fuck it.

Up until yesterday... I had moved back to the county I grew up in 3 months ago and went from being required to reporting to probation twice a year to having to twice a month just because I changed addresses. Where do I have to report in to? The beautiful capital of New Jersey, a 5 minute drive my old cop spot. 

On my way to my therapy appointment (for drugs), I decided I might entertain myself with an alternate route. While copping drugs was in my mind, I was not set on definitely doing it.. until I am driving with the windows down on yesterdays beautiful day and hear one of the most amazing sounds to a deprived dope boy, ""Yeoo!"". Two black guys sitting on a bench under some trees give me a nod. I drive 100ft down and park the car and approach my caller.

Me: ""Whats good? 4 for 20?""

dboy: ""Ay what?""

Me: ""D, you got an deisel?""

dboy: ""uhh yeah but its weird how you just like pulled up""

Me: ""You were the one that shouted at me""

I eventually told him who I used to get off of which instantly always makes the dboys around here feel much more safe that I am not a cop despite my haircut, build, and dress just shouts it at this point.

We drive to his friends house, and oddly this was the most polite soft spoken d-boy I ever met. We make a quick exchange after I drop him off and pull back around after he gets the stuff and 4 double sealed bags marked ""Training Day"" become mine.

I was scheduled to get drug tested at my drug therapy because I like to proactively show my wife how good I am doing.. ironic now huh. Miraculously I wait until after the appointment and get some rigs at CVS. 

I decide to only shoot one bag even though before after taking long breaks I would usually do at least 2. That was a good decision because the rush hit my like a train and I was already nodding after one.

I go do some errands and before I am about to ride home despite to shoot another.. I am not ZONKED. I taught myself a quick lesson not to do drugs and drive anymore eventhough I used to all the time I was so scared nodding the whole riding being all over the lane in mid day. Praise the lord I made it home alive and not getting pulled over. Miraculously my wife was not feeling well so we had a long night of just laying down napping watching movies all day.


Now today I just shot another bag and feel amazing, only one left... but now starts the hard part. I make literally 10 times what I used to make so money isn't the barrier it once was before, but I truly do not want to get addicted again. My barrier of being afraid of getting caught trying to find a new connect is no longer as I have someones number. All my experience showed in the past I am not mentally strong enough just to chip. Please pray that this was the last time for a while.

Peaks and valleys. Weâve all had our share of ups and downs. Sometimes the downs can be pretty damn deep, they can seem bottomless. The dark of the tunnel can seem to stretch on into the distance without end. Light can be found at that end, which isnât always an oncoming train, if you just refuse to give up. That doesnât mean we wonât fail. Life happens. But you donât have to surrender.  

Iâm a dinosaur on here. In one of her blogs, Tracyh415 refers to herself as a dinosaur, so Iâm borrowing, but Iâm a bit older than she is. Iâm on the cliff between Baby Boomers and Generation X.  I got to be a dinosaur both because Iâm stubborn, not too bright sometimes, and I have not given up.  

Some of us started dancing with the devil to escape something, to tamp down emotional or physical pain, some just wanted to party or chase a new rush. Regardless, most, if not all, of us have one or more triggers that really get us going and turbo charge the urge to use, whatever be the d.o.c. Whether youâre trying to put the pipe, bottle, tube or needle down for a day, a week, for good or not at all, something drives us to it.  

Triggers. My first, at least recognized, triggers were deathly shyness and a fear of loss. Some roots go deeper, or grew later, but, hey, Iâm not willing to wave all my laundry in public. So, I became the boozing weekend warrior at 13, finding liquid courage to approach the hot girls or join a group going to the lake or whatever. Or. That twelve pack or bottle or pipe to forget the funerals of loved onesâ¦my paternal grandfather at 7, my best friend Charlie at 9, my one, and only, uncle at 13. I never knew my momâs parents, they were gone before I was a twinkle in anyoneâs eye. My friend Greg at 14, my buddy Chris at 15â¦my buddy Richard at 16â¦then Mike later the same year and John at 17. Car wrecks, gun shots, drownings, suicides.  And during this chaos in crept my buddiesâ¦.weed, hash, acid, shrooms, X, Darvon, Darvocet, vicodin, valium, H, coke, Oxy, dilliesâ¦â¦no meth though, go figure.  While, sure, it doubtless sucked worse for their familiesâ¦still, it felt, and often still feels, like I was a walking plague bearer. Then, the ODs. The long, never ending, blue tinged list of ODs. So. Fear? Loathing? Fury? Atâ¦death. Kind of an inescapable thing to start hating and fearing out the gate and so young. But. We all have our issues, our triggers, and itâs a subjective thing. My pain isnât more, or less, than yours because, well, itâs yours and you wrestle with it in your own hell.  

No matter where you go, there you are and your memories follow, haunting, whispering, not easy things to escape from. Just one more drink, another bong hit, another line, push that plungerâ¦maybe it will go awayâ¦for a time.  

So if youâre trying to put it downâ¦to walk away, I salute you. Itâs a path, already littered with pain before you start, ragged, jagged and bloody. But. You can reach the top. This dinosaur keeps dodging meteors and keeps rolling along, getting back up after being knocked, again, on my ass,  and Iâm nothing special.

52qitw,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/52qitw/precipitated_withdrawal_question/,15,https://redd.it/52qitw,inEuph0ria,Precipitated withdrawal question,"So in another post, there was a discussion about subs and PWD.

There were a few people who claimed that even if someone isn't physically dependent on opiates, they will still go through precipiated withdrawal if they take a sub without waiting enough time.  Like, someone who doesn't use very often...they take a Percocet.  Then, a couple of hours later after the effects have worn off, they take a sub.  They claimed that person would still go though PWD the same as someone who is physically dependent, because it is ripping the Oxycodone off the receptors and that it what causes PWD.

I was wondering if anybody had any clear cut information about this being true or not.  I just don't see how someone who is not physically dependent can go through PWD, if they aren't even dependent enough to go through WDs in the first place if they were to stop taking opiates abruptly.  Even though it is ripping the opiate off the receptors, I wouldn't think it would affect a non-dependent person as their body doesn't physically need the drug.

I honestly think if a non-dependent person claims they are experiencing PWD after taking a sub, it's actually just that the sub was too strong for them and made them puke.  People underestimate how fucking strong Bupe is if you don't have a tolerance.  If I am wrong, I will apologize for assuming this.

TL:DR -  ELI5 how someone who isn't dependent on opiates could still go through PWD.  It doesn't make sense to me.  ",1473860494.0

I found this one this morning and copy pasted for your reading pleasure. 

**START:**

"" There has been a rise in the use of Naloxone by non-medical personnel or civilians due to the rise in Heroin overdoses that have happened in the past few years. The result of the overdoses has brought attention to the quick responding drug, Naloxone. This can bring the person back to life with one quick dose. Public health authorities have noticed overdose of heroin, and they have equipped not only the medical first responders with Naloxone, but police officers and other civilians that are willing to be trained to administered this drug, I donât think this is a good idea in helping the Heroin addicts to help them to get off this drug. This only makes the Heroin addict have a second chance at life.

I feel there is a reason that medical staff have many years of training before administering medicine to a person. The Heroin addicts that are taking the drugs may or may not be thinking about the consequences of that drug when they take it, but regardless, they now have a second chance to do more heroin thanks to the prevalent disbursement of Naloxone. Heroin addiction has a powerful control over the body and mind of the heroin addict. This Heroin addict is not aware of what the person is doing to himself/herself. Therefore, there is already little fear of death or overdose to the addict. Now that we have equipped more first responders to save the addicts life and give the addict more chances to use Heroin once the addicts serve his/her time from prison. 

Being that Heroin can be injected into the blood stream as one method of taking Heroin, it gives the addict little time to think about the action of taking this drug. The effects of the heroin are immediate, which is why heroin is highly addictive, and there is little time to stop the process if you did have second thoughts and decided you didnât want to continue the drug. There is an immediate rush of relaxation in the body and a decreased sense of pain. So why would the addict want to stop using this if this is the great feeling that occurs inside oneâs body? 

Heroin use destroys the physical and mental body with lung damage, kidney failure, danger to the heart, and causes your thinking ability to decrease over time. This addiction is very strong to the body and mind, so much that the heroin addict isnât aware of the damage they are doing to their own body. This is why there are so many groups such as the Narconon.org, and mental health facilities to help the person come off of the Heroin safely and effectively. The euphoria that the addict feels when taking Heroin is so pleasurable that it causes many to not want to stop. Also, knowing that the sickness and pain that you feel of withdrawal is painful and unpleasant, most just keep using the Heroin. This is why the abuse of Heroin is so strong.

Again, why are putting the pressure on police officers to save the addicts lives, who are already dodging bullets and trying to keep our world a safer place, and now we want to bring these addicts back to life? Why do we make medical staff train for years on medicine to help others but we can give a crash course on administering Naloxone to police officers, non-medical personnel or civilians? When you take heroin and you know it may potentially kill you from the very beginning, then why do heroin addicts get a second chance at life? I have yet to read a story where someone gets saved by Naloxone from a police officer, goes to jail, does the time, and comes out to turn his life around for the rest of his life. Please help me understand why this helping the addicts and not enabling them to continue to use.""

Think of all the people you set a line to at a party, they are part of the statistic, think of all the people you know who tried it once and puked their guts up for hours, they are part of that statistic, and most importantly think of all the people who just aren't bothered about sourcing more and just drop it after a few tries. 

THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO DON'T GET HOOKED

When I see you planning the night, pooling your money, getting antsy waiting for the boy to come, I don't see people who are just gonna drop this drug. I see addicts, YOU ARE THE ONE IN TEN. Something in your brain latched onto this chemical and said 'This is what I need' the other 9/10 don't have that, if you crave it, if you get sweaty palms thinking about the burn of that first line, if you can't hold onto cash without thinking 'well I don't really need this money' then you are the one in ten. 

So many people think they're special, that they're that 9/10, but you aren't. you're just a dumb kid looking for an excuse to jump into the hottest water this earth has to offer offer.

Just had a question for you all regarding the strength of ECP in New York City, despite the fact that I know it varies tremendously.  I have a pretty decent oxycodone tolerance, I'll take around 100mg split between orally and up the nose for a nice time and like 140mg for a real nice time. Had never done ECP until tonight though, only smoked tar once and it was a very underwhelming amount. 

Just got a movie of some off-white powder though and tried it for the first time. I insufflated (don't use needles) 1, waited 30min, 2, waited 30min, 3, waited an hour and fifteen, and 4 stamps of it and feel super laid back now and have been noddin a bit but it's more what I expected two bags to feel like. To me it feels like roughly 80-120mg oxy, is that competitive for 4 stamps of NYC ECP?

Nodding too hard; didn't read ~ not much experience with ECP but a lot with oxy.  Bought ECP today and not sure how strong it should be. Should one stamp be about the same as, if not slightly weaker than, a 30mg roxycodone?

Edit: just took my 5th line and also thought I should add that I've been smoking weed the whole time",1473847435.0

Monday noon that area felt a little sore. Then by the evening that arm felt pretty sore but i did a decent amount of driving with just that arm. And its not uncommon for my arms to get tired from driving a long time.
Tuesday my arm was still sore. But tuesday night it feels like the soreness has increased from just my bicep and inner elbow to my real upper arm muscles/shoulder. 
Wednesday at 3am i tried sleeping on my back. Woke up at 430am and my whole left arm was numb/asleep. Shook it out, massged it and its not anymore, now it just feels sore again but like if i dont move it around every couple of minutes it will fall asleep again.


Whats going on? Could i really be just that sore from driving and having bruises [probably slowing bloodflow] really have made a difference?
Like i said only shot up twice over 2 and a half days and it wasnt an artery hit, the high was intense, probably shouldve done less, but there was no redness, swelling, pain, etc. Not until a day/2 days was there any pain. 


Should i go to the doctor about this or is there anything i could do yo help it? Im kind of freaking out and thats probably not helping the issue.

Now onto hitting a vein, it says once you do the blood NEVER comes out on its own without pulling back. And that its dark red and shouldnt hurt aside from the tiny prick. Now this is where im confused. Whenever i shoot i poke till i found a vein. If i pull back and nothing comes? I take it out and poke again until ive got the vein. But the thing is i can never tell ive hit the vein until i see blood in the rig BEFORE i even pulled back. Which contradicts the harm reduction pdf thing. Now, hardly any blood comes out just a teeeeeny bit, then i pull and it comes and seems dark red, so then i go at it and everythings usually fine.

Every day I deal with multiple patients who have overdosed.  They are usually more frustrating to deal with and make the day extremely difficult.  Its started to negatively effect my ability to spend time with other patients who are there for heart attacks/strokes/sepsis and other severe medical conditions.  

One year ago I was doing a scene flight (usually trauma) where someone had struck a road worker with their car.  The patient was a 27 yo M who had been pinned between the oncoming car and his truck.  His lower extremities were almost severed by the impact and it had taken crews a long time to get him out.  He had been bleeding out for his wounds for a while and was barely conscious.  I remember he only said one thing ""please don't let me die"" then went unconscious.  We gave him blood and got him to the hospital.  We tried further resuscitation and took him to the OR.  His wife and daughter showed up but he died in the hospital that night.  The car that struck him had overdosed on heroin and struck him.

I understand that since a lot of you are on reddit you are probably relatively high functioning users of opiates.  You are probably knowledgeable and may not overdose or use dirty needles.

I'd still like to ask you to please stop.  Every time I think about you and this community I get so sad.  You probably could be an even better version of yourself than you already are if you weren't involved with this substance abuse.  There are so many interesting things in the world that aren't heroin I find it hard to believe that you can't indulge in something else.  You are also supporting an industry that builds itself on the self-destruction of individuals and their communities.

I often hear that people get addicted to prescription pain killers and then start using heroin.  Initially percocet and norco were not thought to be as addictive as they turned out to be.  Most research points to that they are not if they are used to suppress pain as opposed to induce euphoria.  We as physicians need to discuss the responsible use of pain medication in people who need it.

I hope if you are reading this that you have at least a small twinge of wanting to rid yourself of opiates.  I hope that you are successful.  Please try to figure out a support system, triggers, and other planning to be successful in that endeavor.

I'm happy with only ever being able to get one pussy as long as it's hers 

That is all I really have to say 

I love you Celest but I'm not going to include you in this twisted way .

I know you think you know what you want but in time you will understand. I pray for the baby's that aren't born that you and i do them the favour and bring them into a happy, perfect world. I believe you when you say that I'm the one for you and I knew from the moment I saw you that I would never be able to love anyone the way I would want to with you. But this isn't a movie or a fairy tale. I cannot function sober and I am not able to give you the kind of life i want to while struggling with the pain I feel everyday.

The schedule I've worked out is using dope for the last time tomorrow morning ~9 AM. I'll go the rest of tomorrow not using and take some sleep aids to help me get a little rest. I'll take 2 mg Thursday either when I wake up or at 9 AM, whichever comes later. Then, if needed, I'll take another 2 mg.

Why am I asking? Because I'm a legit pain patient with a specified amount I am supposed to take. I'd like any fent I consume to be as LONG-ACTING as possible. If this is impossible or too complicated, I'll bite the bullet and shell out for patches. Thanks to anyone who can shed a little light!

52mduk,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/52mduk/fuckboy_dealer_shit/,38,https://redd.it/52mduk,_randy_randerson_,Fuckboy dealer shit,"TL;DR- dealer shorted me two bags and gave BS excuses. He's normally on point so I'm giving him a pass this time, but I'm finding a second dealer in case this becomes a regular occurrence. I'm getting clean via a quick sub taper within the next two weeks.

Edit: I'm realizing now that this whole post is probably a big overreaction. I haven't been having the best day and I'm taking it out on my dealer. Sorry for yet another dumb high rant.

My guy shorted me two bags today. I never check the number of bags till I get home. The reason is because my guy and I usually just do a quick handoff on the street when we meet. I don't have a car and he works on the corner most days so we don't really have any other options. So we do a quick swap on the sidewalk and I slip the dope into my sock and then walk back to the el. Only when I finally get home do I take out the bags and count them. Today when I counted there were 12 instead of the expected 14 (my guys bundles are always 14, no exceptions). I texted him that there were only 12 and he said that he had counted 14 and I must've lost them. Then he called me and basically repeated his text and said ""I would never short you bro, you probably dropped them, the rubber band was loose."" I knew this was BS because the band was actually very tight, and the bundle had gone into my sock immediately after he handed it to me. But I didn't press the issue, because I couldn't prove anything.

This is the first issue I've had with this guy. Other than this, he's been great. He's always ready to meet when I call. He tells me where to meet him right away and I've never had to wait more than 20 minutes for him to show up. I can consistently have dope in my hand within an hour of calling him. So I'm gonna let this one slide. But if it happens again I may have to start hitting him up less and get a new main connect. I've been thinking for a while now about getting a second dboy(or girl), and this incident solidified that decision. Soon I'll go out cold copping/dboy shopping. That way I'll have someone on deck to replace my current guy if he keeps trying to fuck around.

I just don't get why he had to short me by two. If he had just shorted one I would've chalked it up to a mistake on his part and not even mentioned it. One missing bag is an understandable mistake, two is premeditated fuckery. If he had been less greedy he would've gotten away with it.

On a better note, I also scored some xannie bars and subs and got a plug for them. I'm planning to start a quick sub taper sometime in the next week or two. This lifestyle is quickly becoming unmanageable. My brain is mush, I spend half of the day scoring dope or nodding off in it. I'm blowing off responsibilities left and right and rapidly draining my bank account. The good news is that despite how far behind I've fallen, I can catch up, but only if I start soon. I'm stoned off my ass and just realized how fucking rambling this post is so I'm cutting it off here. ",1473794943.0

Excited to see the answers, I'm sure we all have different use patterns, and I think it'd be interesting to see and discuss. Also, I think I'll be doing these QotDs every day at noon instead of midnight.

the more worrisome problem is the vomit. i'm used to throwing up from opiates, but this stuff was black. it actually looked like a super dark wash of pst, but that doesn't make sense because there was so much more than the amount i drank, & it was like 8 or 9 hours later.

52vsmk,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/52vsmk/opiate_shaming/,14,https://redd.it/52vsmk,HarpuaUnbound,Opiate shaming,"I think I'm going to start taking pictures of people vomiting in gutters outside of bars from alcohol. I certainly see enough of them. How about video of smokers hacking up a lung, we'll do this and post the shocking pictures everywhere. 

It's unfortunate that for the most part, the results of drinking too much are vomiting, passing out, and a giant headache. So it doesn't create the same level of ""shocking"" images. Anyone who's been to a college dorm has gotten used to the sights of heavy alcohol use. 

The numbers of people destroying their lives (and all their children) from alcohol in this country probably far, far out numbers the opiate addicts. Is that ""shocking""?. Let's run around to trailer parks and snap some ""shocking"" pictures. 

So, nice easy target to find a couple laid out on opiates and swing your head in shame. Go up to some meth heads and do the same thing. Lecture them, see how that goes. 

And about medical responders. Yes, you're already doing good, valuable work. There are all kinds of medical emergencies. You are not some benevolent God making sacrifices to ""bring people back to life"". You have been handed a supply of basically magic shots, and it's your job to stab people in the ass with it. Thank you. It's probably much better for you than a gun shot wound, rape, or other messes. 

Stop the shaming of people. Unless you have a comprehensive set of ideas and are actively working towards solutions, the only thing these pictures are going to do (and it's nothing new at all), is give fodder to the media, which causes the ignorant to start pressuring law enforcement to ""do something!!"".

52v5pf,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/52v5pf/if_youre_ever_on_the_fence_about_quitting_read/,6,https://redd.it/52v5pf,bigbootybigdoody,"If you're ever on the fence about quitting, read this first and then make your decision.","Opiates are amazing. I'm not trying to tell anyone otherwise. I've posted here before and under an older account (until I got doxxed, but I digress), and I've never been one to say, ""You should quit, blah blah blah."" That's a decision for you to make, and you alone. Unless the courts have decided that they should make that choice for you ð. I do, however, think people make the decision to quit under poor circumstances, and that makes the follow through so less likely. And when you fail a couple of times you start to think that it is an impossible struggle. That you'll never accomplish it. So, here are some tips from a few people that I've seen do it, myself, and some anecdotes passed down through junkie history:

1. Remember, you have to make the choice to quit. Others making the choice isn't the right motivation. Sure, you may start your journey because of others, through forced drug screens, court, jail, rehab, or family and friends giving an ultimatum, but once you start you need to find a reason for you to do it, whatever that may be. There is no right reason for everyone. It could be health concerns or it could be the fact you can't save up for a car while on it. Whatever it is, make it yours. 

2. A lot of people make the decision because they've ran out of their script, their plug is dry or pinched, or they've run out of money. Don't make the decision a week before payday or a few days before your script is back. Make the choice right after you've been paid or your script is ready. When you choose to quit because you're poor on Monday and Friday you get paid, when Friday comes around you're going to cop. If you've been paid and you're actively choosing to not cop, then you're making a choice. You aren't forced to do it. And shit, if you decide to cop, it's because you want to, not because now you can. 

3. There's nothing wrong with pharmaceutical help to maintain, taper, quit or feel better. People that say ""using Suboxone isn't really quitting"", or ""if it isn't cold turkey it doesn't count"" are douche canoes. There is no scorecard to quitting. You don't get a gold star for cold turkey, and you don't get docked points for using Suboxone. And the idea that you need to really experience withdrawal to appreciate getting clean is moronic. No opiate fiend has ever partied like a rockstar and then decided to quit by using aids and never experienced withdrawal. We all know how it feels, we don't need to force ourselves to experience it fully to know that it blows dick. 

4. Whether you want to go to meetings or not, doesn't matter. What matters is having a support group. It can be as big as you want, 10, 50, or 100. But just 1 will work, too. They don't have to be at a meeting or in rehab, and they don't have to know you in real life. Just reach out to someone, anyone, to talk things out. Knowing that other people have gone through it, are going through it, or want to go through it is enough. It doesn't even have to be someone that knows the struggle. Just someone that you can be open and honest to. 

5. Don't set a time for you to feel better. Five days, fifteen days. Forty-five days, fuck it. Keep track of.your sobriety, but don't tell yourself, ""I should feel normal by now."" That's the attitude that makes you fall back into the game. It takes some people a long time to feel right, whether it's mentally or physically. You could find your identical junkie twin, and they could get over it months before you. Just realize that everyday past the first day is a day closer to the end. All you can do is put time behind you and your habit. 

6. Break the routine. Wake up. Scrounge around for that last hit you saved for the AM, hoping you didn't decide to do it at 4am, knowing you had work/family event this afternoon. Struggle to your free time, and then pick up the phone. Voicemail, voicemail, subscriber your trying to reach cannot be located, text, text.  Get the call back. Wait twenty minutes past the time your supposed to meet, be at the spot, wait thirty more minutes. Finally go home.  Look at all that time you wasted trying to make it and then getting it, just to get back to solace. Now you've got all that time freed up. And your mind is racing. Your mind is bored. TV sucks, video games suck. Food is unbearable. Ugh. But once you stop calling someone every day and driving for an hour, you'll start breaking your routine. The struggle isn't a joke. You've conditioned yourself to do this every day, every other day. Whatever. You have to get to a point where you aren't mentally jumping over hurdles to get to your ""me time"". 

7. Find something that you can do that makes you happy, even if it's just a few minutes out of every day. It's hard to be happy coming off. Your brain is fucked. Anxiety is through the roof. Maybe you love reading, writing, or painting. Maybe you like to go to the park with your dog. Even five minutes of enjoyment is five minutes out of hell that is withdrawal. Teach yourself to be happy again. 

And the most important fact I've learned from everyone I've associated with, and myself...there is no true equal. Remember that time you took that giant hit, your buddy gave you a line of killer yay, you smoked a blunt and then you managed to get laid at the end of it all? What an amazing feeling. Yeah, you won't get that again. You can replicate every part of it, but you won't replace that warm and fuzzy opiate high. But it was a fake feeling. Yeah you felt great, but it wasn't real. There's a reason everyone feels like shit after its all said and done. It's like your body was maxing out on excellence, and you threw gasoline on the fire. Like in Back to the Future 3, when they make the train go 88mph using those crazy firestarter logs. Where's the fucking train? In a ravine. In Fast and the Furious, when Brian blows all that Nos and almost has Vin Diesel. How sweet was his ride at the end of the race? Keep in mind that the highs you had were only attainable by overloading your body. There are things in this world that will make you happy, I promise. You might look back on those highs and become reminiscent. But remember that you had to sacrifice happiness from future days to have it those days. You're just borrowing happiness from the future. Eventually, you'll run out, or your train will crash in a ravine, or your intake manifold will crack. Whatever. Just don't hold your future happiness hostage by comparing it to past exploits. 

So yea, that's it. There's guides all around for tapering, ""pain free"" withdrawal (haha), and there's endless sources of support and outreach groups at your disposal, so there's no need to bore you with that. And again, this wasn't here to convince anyone to quit, that's dumb shit. Maybe it convinced you that you could quit, now that's a different story. If I could convince you that you could do something that you wanted to do, then that's all I'm after. Hell, think of the absurd things you've done to cop when you thought it was impossible, and imagine applying a fraction of that to quitting. If you wanted to. Don't do anything you don't want to do, there's no point. We've all proven time and time again that we are going to do what we want, otherwise we totally would have just done it once or twice a month, or just on the weekends. So make sure you want to do it if you're going to do it. That's the most important step. The mind is powerful and the human body is resilient. Convince yourself you can do something and it'll happen. 

If anyone had any questions or reads this and wants advice, pointers, or just needs to vent. I'm here. PM me. But this probably took a while to read, especially if you were nodding out, and maybe your DOC has midget legs, so go ahead and take another hit. I hope it's fire.a the you'll catch that dragon. I got really close, but he's exhausting to chase. 

Peace.

Recently my boyfriend relapsed on heroin and our world has been falling apart since. We fight all the time and think he secretly doesn't want to be with me. 
I just feel so desperate to be loved by him. He used to make me feel so special and put effort and energy into our relationship. Lately because he has been so focused on his addiction our relationship has gone in a downward spiral. He doesn't enjoy talking with me. He's out of it or sick all the time. We haven't been intimate in weeks. I just feel so second place to heroin in every single aspect of his life. I feel so unimportant and unwanted. He keeps saying it will get better but I don't know how much longer I can feel like this. Like am I supposed to believe as soon as he starts getting sober that everything is going back to the way it was? He used to make me feel like such a princess, which is every girls dream. With him I felt like I was on cloud 9 and nothing could change that. Now I just feel so so undesirable.


I know it sounds like I'm complaining but it don't want to keep bothering him with telling him I feel unwanted because apparently while he is going through his addiction that  isn't top priority. Thanks for letting me vent. ",1473922904.0

So now I'm going down 10 - 20g every week or two. It hasn't been that bad but still not the easiest thing.

What do y'all think about using drugs like coke and benzos (in a non addict way, from once a week at most to twice a month at minimum) during my taper? I use it as a way to kill boredom and kill my want to get high every once in a while. The rest of the week / month I'm totally fine about not using other drugs, especially other opioids.

So, what's your personal opinion on this matter? Do you think it's cool that I still use rarely with non-opioid substances to have some fun while continuing my taper schedule with no hiccups?",1473918950.0

I was hyped to try this stuff as it seems EVERYONE has positives about it. Until me. I don't know if it was bunk powder or what. But it might as well have been Valerian Root. 

Anyone else have this kind of experience?",1473887272.0
52shlg,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/52shlg/the_overdose/,17,https://redd.it/52shlg,RandomJunkie28,The Overdose,"We were sitting around with her parents, I canât remember if we were still having lunch, or sitting outside on her patio when she showed me a text on her phone. It was from her friend rachel, asking if we could drop of some dope later today. I just nodded at her and looked away, worried her parents would suspect something. Itâs so important to keep their suspicions minimized, if they found out that I use itâd ruin my reputation. They like me at the moment, and I like that trust and respect Iâm getting from them.
Her friend wasnât going to be paying as much as I wanted to, but I wanted to give catie a chance to see her, she was so excited when she heard Rachel was back in NJ. Lately sheâs been more annoyed with her than anything else, but whatever.
âShe kept texting rachel, I didnât see the point of it, since it would be house before weâd be free. Catieâs mom (pat), catie, and me would be going to a SMART meeting later tonight. Itâs like Narcotics anon lite. Itâs basically the most boring form of a support group possible since one of the rules there is no âWar Stories.â Personally my favorite part of NA.
âLater on at the meeting catie was still nodding out, claiming that she was going through W/D. Everyone buys that shit, the dude hosting the group seemed to allude to having done H in his own past but I dunno if I buy it considering how gullable he was. He was blonde, with some of the bluest eyes Iâd seen. At the start of the meeting his attention was leveled on me, making sure I was following along and everything. He could clearly see me holding my girls hand, but seemed to be the same as everyone else. The people that know assume Iâm the addict dragging the girl down. In reality itâs pretty equal (and she got us started with shooting!).
âI canât remember his name, the hosts, the way he spoke was affected by something; my suspicion is that his face is partially paralyzed but Iâm not sure. He talked like he knew the truth about the world around us, without any doubt in himself. Hypnotizing. The meeting passed too quickly I could have listened to that blonde asshole talk for hours.
âAfter the meetings itâs our custom to go home and do some dope, to take ourselves back out of the reality of trying to quit, reduce the stress of knowing one day the W/D is going to come and itâs not going to be over until weâre actually clean. I canât belive it, I refuse to think that Iâll be hooked for much more than another week. Of course I will, who knows how long this is going to go on for, or how this is going to end.
âSo afterwords we get home and we do our last stamps. The dope was good, really good, weâd been lucky with that lately. Never getting anything much below average. These bags weâre about 2x stronger than the norm. The stamp was rolex. After we bang up I tell catie to call Rach, sheâs under strict parental rules since she just got kicked out of her halfway house for using. She shouldnât get caught. I tell Catie to call Rach and figure everything out while I take a piss. Coming back from the bathroom Catie tells me thereâs a bush in front of Rachels house, whatever. We get in the car, everythingâs figured out. Weâre going to get her debit card, go to the bank, go down to cop on the block, drop off raches stuff and go home.
âWe drop off raches stuff and start headed home. Making the impulsive choice to stop at our usual place and bang up before starting the trip home. I mix up a shot and hit myself first. The stamps #FOH, one weâve done a million times before so I mixed two bags. Fucking woah. Itâs good. Itâs really good.
âEverything is far away and doesnât matter, Iâm noddin. Two bags never makes me nod like this. Iâm not even worried, just feels good.
âCaties getting pissed cos Iâm taking so long to mix her shot; sheâs getting mad whiney so I try to hurry up but I really canât. Nothing really matters anyway. It takes me like 20 minuts, or feels that way to mix her shot and finally try n hit her. I put the needle in her arm and push it down Letting it dangle after. I look at her and ask: Right? She nods at me, clearly off her ass.
âI start driving
âShould I get gas?â I ask mostly myself, she doesnât respond. âyeah, couldnât hurtâ so I pull up to the pump. Itâs NJ so thereâs a dude there to pump the gas for me. I stop at the pump and the dudes chillin by the gas cap waiting for me to open it, Iâm having a hard time figuring it out. It takes me a minute but I get it open. Okay, now Iâve gotta find my credit card, where the fuck is it. I dig in the center console, pins fall out and onto the floor of the car, fuck it. I find the credit card and roll down the window. âFifteenâ I mumble at the guy. He didnât get it, Iâve gotta say it again. âFifteen! Regular!â I try to say, he sticks my card in the pump. I look at catie.
âHer heads leaning back, looking up, her mouths open and drools coming out. I shake her a bit, âbaby you okay?â nothing. No movement her eyes donât open her mouth doesnât close. I start to worry thinking about how high I am. I shake her violently âCATIEâ I shout at her. Still nothing. At this point I know exactly whatâs going on, and I refuse to accept it. I start slapping her face, not to hard at first. âBABY come onâ still nothing. I grab her hair and shake her violently. Nothing, the attendent hands me my credit card, 0 fucks given about what Iâm doing. I pull into a parking spot and check her breathing.
âSheâs not. âCATIEâ I scream at her this time, shaking her way harder and slapping her face as hard as I can. She doesnât move or anything, sheâs not breathing.
âAt this moment the reality of the situation sets in, she canât die, not in my car. Her parents will know it was me giving her the dope, I should drop her off at a hospital or something. Call 911. I donât know what to do, and the love of my life is dying next to me. I try rescue breathing, opening her mouth and putting mine against it, I breath air into her. Her lungs fill, I did it right. I do it a few more times and check her heart; still beating. Okay, Iâll just do this till the rush passes and she comes to, shoultnt  take too long. Iâm paniking, making dumb choices, scared out of my mind. I put her seat down and keep breathing for her. Every now and then stopping to slap the shit out of her, check her heart, and beg at her to wake up. A car parks next to us, Iâm dreanched in sweat from the effort of breathing for her; looking up at them then looking down and slapping my girlfriend and breathing. I donât casre about anything besides this girl waking up. Nothing matters if she doesnât wake up. I think to myself thank god Iâve got enough left to OD myself if I canât save her. Weâll both be dead, found in my car. Nothing matters if she wonât wake up. Twenty minutes in and the sweat is mixing with my tears, my face is slipery, Iâm still forcing air into her. Iâve never been so scared, and so determined. I blow more air in, slap her some more, and finally I get the idea. Thereâs a water bottle, I take the cap off and throw water in her face. Catie sits up quickly looking confused.
ââBABY! Please say somethingâ, âWhat?â sheâs partially lucid, Iâm starting to relax. âYou were deadâ I croak,my voice harsh from screaming at her for the last 20 minutes. âWhat?â, âBaby please just let me hear you breath on your ownâ She takes a deep breath, I could cry Iâm so happyâ¦.",1473884215.0

From the addict's perspective, the precipitated withdrawals are, to say the least, incredibly painful, and they necessitate another fix ASAP to kill that pain. From society's perspective, it's a consequence-free way of enabling bad decision-making; after all ""they're just going to get high again immediately, and we're footing the bill.""

At one point in my active use, I was using fairly large amounts of acetyl- and butyr-fentanyl ordered from gray and dark markets. To fund this, I sold some of it for profit in pre-measured shots. Having experienced several overdoses from these chemicals, I knew there was much risk there, even with those pre-measured shots. So I started giving out vials of naloxone obtained from my area's needle exchange to my customers. It took more naloxone to reverse a fentanyl overdose than a heroin or oxy overdose, but it always eventually worked. Sometimes I would run out of naloxone and be unable to obtain more quickly, so I would cook up shots of Suboxone or buprenorphine-only meds and hand those out to customers.

The buprenorphine-only and Suboxone shots proved more effective at reversing overdoses, presumably due to bupe's higher binding affinity. I did get complaints, however (ungrateful much?). Because even though the initial PWDs were followed fairly quickly by stabilization as the bupe settled in, people found it harder to break through the bupe; if they went back at it with fentanyl, it would be several hours at least, and if they went back with anything else, as much as a full day. In that time, they found it pointless try and use, although some tried.

From this, I propose buprenorphine as an adjunct to or replacement for naloxone in reversing overdoses. It would be better for users who would not have to suffer through full-length PWDs, and it would be more palatable to the public because it would force a cooling-off time after an overdose where a user would perhaps consider the consequences of the lifestyle and would not be doing anything and everything to fix the PWDs.

Tldr: buprenorphine or bupe/naloxone would be better than just naloxone for ODs.

Thoughts?

Edit: I think it would also be pretty easy to get pharmaceutical companies behind this, as it would be a new use for an old chemical, and thus a new avenue of profit for them, all harm reduction aside.",1473880933.0
