So: I am generally in very poor health, and I also often partake in heroin. There's a good chance that I might die relatively soon for reasons unrelated to my heroin use. My biggest fear is that one of my friends or dealers might get in trouble if I die because they'll mistake something for a heroin overdose and go through my phone and see my messages. Even if it was a heroin overdose I don't want my dealer to get in trouble. IMO drug dealers shouldn't suffer the consequences of users using their drugs, unless they're doing something really shitty like cutting it with fentanyl (in which case I still don't if it was \*him\* who cut it or if it was someone higher up in the chain.)

\*\*If I die, how do I make sure no one gets in trouble?\*\* Right now, as silly as it sounds, I leave a note on my fridge saying that don't feel right and I'm having heart palpitations - in case I drop before I can call 911.

I never smoke when I am in the same city as him but this isn't the point of my post so please don't get caught up on how I am a shit girlfriend (although, I do agree: I am a shit girlfriend). He was injecting everyday for eight years and, at the height of his addiction, he says he shot up eight times a day. I was raped several times a year ago so we haven't actually had sex (I wasn't ready). I want to change this and so does he but every-time we have a serious conversation about it he keeps saying that heroin has fucked up his body and he doesn't want to disappoint me, and how he hasn't had sex in years etc. When I try to ask him what he's actually worried about he just says he's not the same and gets really upset. It devolves pretty quickly and he says that I am not very reassuring. 

I want to understand what the fuck he's worried about because I just don't have enough knowledge on the subject to understand. I tried googling it too but a lot of the sources I find are pretty vague and related to general drug use.

Also, I know I don't come across the best in this post but I genuinely want to know if anyone has some experience with this as I'm just a bit confused.  ",1540237332.0

I've never been to0 active, except when a tramadol thread pop-out, I was there to fight the myth and the wrong facts. I lost my previous account **tramalove** in case anyone tries to reach out, but I don't have a ""reputation"".

&#x200B;

Now to benzos. I had a GREAT connect, and have been in a binge for around a month. A couple days ago I tried the combo I called ""one and one"", 1 diazepam and 1 clonazepam. Then 2, then 3, then 4 ""one and one"", and I wasn't wasted. Now I'm scared. I've been through opi WD hundred of times, but benzo WDs are on other level, life threatening seizures level.

&#x200B;

Do you think that if I stop cold turkey I might have a seizure? A bad time is almost unavoidable. I still have like 8 diazepam left and 12-15 clonas, is taper an option? Do any of you have any experinece with these doses?

So, objectively - which is better - taking it every day in low doses or taking a high dose every so often? My guess is making breaks let's your opiate receptors adjust to the natural endorphins your body produces, and tolerance doesn't set in quite as fast if you take a 6 day break... but i might be biased on this one, would love to hear everyone's opinion here.",1540232604.0

&#x200B;

So heres where my questions start.

Ive tried looking online for info on the different kinds of Heroin. ive found some useful things, just havent answered all the questions i have. 

what are the terms #3 #4 and ECP referring to?(are they a regional term?)

In school my boys used to cop stamps, im assuming thats ECP? 

What does ""legs"" mean? Does it have something to do with how long it last?

Ive been gaining interest more to the point i wanna try this shit. (i know noone should try it and im aware of that. still want to try it though) i prefer to sniff my drugs so i was wondering which is the preferred flavor for that ROA?

I will 100% test what i get if/when i do cop, can you get reliable test strips from any stores? Or should i order from an online store? 

How do i go about getting Narcan? im getting a new job and my insurance ends next week, and wont kick back in for 6 months.

Last and least important question, whats your guys favorite slang term for dope and your favorite term for your ROA?

My car is sitting in my apartment parking lot just got notice that if it's not moved it will be towed and I will be fined. The day before my car got totaled I dropped 200$ on a new battery which is destroyed now. This is the lowest I've been since I started my habit. I've definitely felt like I've hit rock bottom before but I've now realized it most certainly gets worse. I had a good job binged through thousands of dollars worth so quick, I always thought heroin was bad but xanax is what is really destroying me and fast. I've never wanted to be clean more than I have right now but at the same time I've never wanted to use more, I've officially lost everything. Right now my urges to use are the highest and my tolerance is fucked and I have nothing. Absolutely fucking nothing.

I‚Äôve searched and haven‚Äôt found a straight answer. Then again, there may not be a straight answer, but I‚Äôll ask anyway. 

For the last month or so I‚Äôve dabbled with oxy and opium, never more than 20mgs of the latter at a time. I realize now that it‚Äôs been roughly every other day. 

Today I realized that I can‚Äôt stop thinking about going home on my lunch break and dosing. I don‚Äôt like that. I realize that I have the beginnings of a psychological addiction. 

My question is primarily about the physical addiction. I have 4 20mg pills left. I don‚Äôt have a local plug; DNM only. I‚Äôm not ordering any more. 

If I crank through these last pills over the next week or two, should I expect anything resembling withdrawals?

I‚Äôm done after these. Famous last words, but I‚Äôm serious. I‚Äôm married, a father, making six figures in great industry. I run marathons and still manage to lift like i did in the corps. Im not throwing it all away. So, asking out of curiosity. I‚Äôm thinking it won‚Äôt be anything, but what do I know.

If you search my post history you can see more details on the actual severity of the sores/infections that have been popping up throughout my body. I blamed it almost all on the coke until today I noticed for the first time that gunpowder heroin seems to form these grains as it cools. So if I cook up a shot, I‚Äôll generally see a few on the cotton after filtering. Even if I spray the filtered solution back out, optionally spray a little cool water, and then refilter with a fresh cotton, the same happens. I‚Äôm freaking out because my habit has been monstrous and recently I‚Äôve been being freaked out more and more by these grainy specks that were appearing on missed shot sores and even in my bloodstream (to test my suspicion, after finishing a shot, I drew back out and found the blood to have a lot of tiny grains (smaller than in the imgur links though). I‚Äôm at least 90% sure they‚Äôre the same thing. The thing is, Ive been using the same consistent dope the whole time. I got another source recently, and when I realized this yesterday I found both batches had the same property. They‚Äôre both super high quality wholesale gunpowder (before it turns to tar) that my dealer and friends/other customers have used for ages, although my habit has been by far the worst. I dont think there‚Äôs anything particularly unusual about the dope since its been touched much less than most batches and everyone I know who‚Äôs tried it loves it. So wtf is up?? Anyone else who has gunpowder‚Äî does yours do this? I really fucking hope my body can filter this out if I take a break now but it‚Äôs been so long before I put 2 and 2 together. I hope I‚Äôm crazy and this is just something else.  It seems obvious but then why is this not a more common issue? Is it just the fact I can go thru a few grams a day, leading it to build up faster than my body can filter it? Omfg

He's always been good, sometimes I have to wait like a half hour but I don't consider that bad, and he always seems fairly straight up about it (and if it's gonna be a while he just tells me to wait to later.

one time while waiting for him I get a knock at my window ""yo what you want"" and I said nothing right now thanks, and the guy says take my number. So, some days later I can't get my regular guy and I figure fuck it. the stuff I got was -really good-, and a little cheaper. so next time I need I call this new guy again. Then I bounced back to the first guy. \*\*(I want to edit in that this has happened before and never ended badly, in case people who aren't located near any of the dope capitals find this ultra suspect)

So this weekend that just ended, I was going to -a vacation spot that's about 2 hours from here, intending to get high in a free room and rent some movies while my mom gambles with the money they comp her. So I poke around and this newer guys says buns for cheap (idk if I can drop exact prices here btu basically he was giving a better deal per bun than I'd get even buying bulk from the other dude). So, I bit.

Now, I know we've all heard the phrase to good to be true so you'd think I could stop there but it's not that simple. this wasn't weak shit, or light bags ... this was something I'd never encountered. Full disclosure, my habit lately is where if I buy 5 buns, that first bun is going up my nose all at once and usually before I get home. but since 1) these were actually very heavy bags 2) I was still new to this guy and 3) I hadn't used in a few days, I decide to dump out 4. But of HUUUGE note, after less than a quarter of that line I stopped. it hurt my nose a bit, I had to drive, and I just figured what's the rush.

This is when things get weird. That pick up happened at about 9:30. I start driving home. The literal next thing I know, I'm at my desk, I've made a mess of it with ice cream, there's an empty bag of sour patch kids that I vaguely remember buying and eating, but also an empty bag of welch's fruit snacks which I do love but I don't remember eating. what's more, I go downstairs and there are 2 7-11 burgers (again, something I like but don't remember buying or cooking) in the microwave and they've say so long they're inedible (and yes har har they aren't really edible to begin with).

My mom gets me for our 2 1/2 hour ride and I can barely talk. my words are slurring... I've been using for 5 years. my parents know in as much as there's been times where I'm nodding and I have been to rehab, so it's not some huge secret , but I've never been so blatantly fucked up that they searched my pockets and that's exactly what happened here.

I'm not going back to rehab, I didn't get kicked out, there's many many worse ways this could have gone... but what I AM is here to say, if you see a stamp that says gunsmoke written in red, please stay away. I know I can't say where I got it but even as mostly a lurker here I'd feel wrong to not share. I've been high as shit before, I really love heroin what can I say... but I don't think this was even close to heroin.

The closest I can describe the feeling is taking a bunch of xanax. I couldn't keep my eyes open, slurring words, and I lost memory of a day and a half. further, this was all friday right? I lost a bun somewhere, or I did it, I truly don't know. friday night ends with me hold 2 buns and 7 bags with the intention of maybe doing 1 bag the next day to see what happens, or trying to barter somewhere to get something out of it if my conscience would let me. Instead I woke up the next day thinking my parents flushed it, so I asked them. not even mad just did you flush it? and they said no, we woke up to a ton of empty bagsin the bathroom, although they didn't count them to see if it was all 27. I have zero recollection of this and zero reason to think they'd lie if they just flushed the stuff as I'd made clear this was some stuff that was worse than bunk, it scared the shit out of me.

Anyway I guess this is sort of a PSA but also asking for advice. when I finally called the guy I got it from he said it ""must have been too strong for me"" ???? I'm not trying to brag about tolerance, I don't shoot up and I am not wealthy enough for the heavy regular use I'd probably be doing if I had more money. but even still, overdoing it has only ever led to severe vomiting and headaches in my world, not extreme word slurring and absolutely not memory loss (besides if you consider nodding memory loss in some convoluted way, but I was forgetting entire conversation, journeys (not with me driving)

I flew home to the Midwest for winter break, and while staying at my folks place noticed my dad had installed a safe in the closet of the room I was staying in. Being a reckless hoodlum and oh so young at the time, I snuck up into his room got his keyring out of his pants and low and behold the safe key was attached..

Upon opening the safe, I was greeted by two large plastic Tupperware containers with all kinds of old Rx meds...Vicodin, Percocet, lorazepam to name a few....and inside as well was a CURIOUS small glass vial labeled for my then deceased grandpa. It was a Rx from the early 90s with a small piece of paper slipped inside identifying it as Meperidine 50mg. Some research discovered this was an old Rx for Demerol, which is rarely used anymore but used to be used in hospitals during and post surgery and sometimes prescribed for acute pain afterwards. There were 12 of them. Greatest opiate I have ever done, even through my 5+ years of heroin use both ECP and BTH...

Here are my thoughts.,"Long story short. Used opiates from age 14 until I was 22 (currently 23). I graduated from University and decided to move half way across the US and start clean. The plan has worked very well so far. I am completely sober, even from alcohol and all other vices. I work a job in the insurance field on the West Coast and life is pretty laid back.  


With that being said, being sober has been a drag. Life is really boring nowadays. I can't seem to find the excitement in life anymore. I wake up, work, eat dinner, watch some basketball/football, go to bed. Even if I get invited out with friends or co-workers, it all seems so bleak. I associate night life with partying. Bars, clubs, house parties... hell, even tailgating lol.

I don't have the desire to go socialize in a non-work environment if I can't rip lines of roxi, drink a cup of codeine, and pop some vicodin. 

&#x200B;

My hobbies are also really boring too... I don't find any joy when playing video games and I have no desire to work out (on opiates I would work out all the time.. I know.. that is weird as hell)

I basically logged in to show him I was ice. We got along great. Crackin jokes and cutting up..

&#x200B;

They're one hell of a drug. I can't say I love anything more. As horrible as that sounds, its the truth my body has established. But Ive realized, sometimes the things we love aren't the things that benefit us.

&#x200B;

I started using opiates probably about 8 years ago, when I was 15 years old. It started with trying different pills as an experimental teenager. This lead to me finding out that I love the way opiates make me feel by far more than anything else. I found that I was more social with them, less inhibited, more funny/outgoing, and quickly started using them as a social lubricant much like the ""normal"" person would use alcohol. I then realized my grandparents had a stash of 100's of 5mg vicodens and that was game over for me. I would take them periodically through the months and use them in strategic times. What started as a recreational high, quickly turned into something where I was using the opiates to compensate for insecurities/lack of feeling social in the way that I always wanted to.

&#x200B;

This never got too out of control, but then I tried heroin three years ago.

&#x200B;

I would never have imagined myself saying this, nor would wish this statement upon anyone's psyche, but; Heroin is amazing.

&#x200B;

I thought my use was under control, as I was maintaining my grades, kicking ass in the gym, and establishing healthy friendships, all while under the periodic use of heroin for 2 years. I didn't realize however, how much I was setting myself up for dependency, as even though I wasn't a full blow addict, I would purchase and utilize the substance when I felt like I wanted to, and use it. Having a hypothetical sense of self control was stimulated by witnessing friends who tried dope at the same time as me, go down extremely bad paths very fast. So i thought I was a ""born prodigy"" in the managing life while recreationally getting high department.

&#x200B;

This is untrue.

&#x200B;

My relaxed view of dope affecting me as a person with ambitions in life, and inability for loved ones to realize what I was doing, reinforced my stance on use, in some way or another for as long as I can remember experimenting with drugs. About a year ago, I really started diving into the drug game. I was snorting ketamine and going to space, then buying dope here and there still and going to therapeutic lala-land. I could study harder and longer on dope. I could go on runs and beat my record times and have longer stamina on dope. I could out-lift my record PR's in the gym on dope. I could talk to girls the way I wanted to on dope. I was a self proclaimed super hero on dope.

&#x200B;

I started using every day. Never injected, thank god, but smoking in the bathroom strategically at my house, under the noses of all my loved ones, never getting caught.

&#x200B;

I realized I had a problem probably about 6 months ago, when my best friend passed away from fentanyl. I wanted to stop, but realized quickly how hard that was. I stopped for 5 days after his death, then used again, feeling like an utter asshole for doing so, but nonetheless doing it. High at his funeral, I was numb, didn't shed one tear, yet torn apart to little pieces in my body about my best friend dying from substance of the like. I felt ashamed. Yet I felt okay. That double edged paradoxically present feeling is the fine line that I always find myself dancing on before establishing that Im going to use, and urgently finding it and using.

&#x200B;

The negative effects of opiate use has affected more than just my wallet. Ive utterly forgotten that theres other pleasures in life than getting high. I didn't realize I had forgotten about sex, masturbation, and appreciating subtle things in life. I want so much out of life, but feel like I can't achieve a lot of these things without feeling that rockstar feeling that allows me to feel like I can take on the world; that I get from dope. My internal hormones and male feelings of confidence and most likely testosterone levels have depreciated. I haven't had sex in a long time because it just wasn't a priority. I have forgotten how to properly flirt with woman and naturally hook up, etc., because through important developmental years where I otherwise would have encountered/learned how to maneuver those situations, I was always wielded with an opiate of one form or another in my system.

&#x200B;

I'm tired of feeling reliant on something other than myself, to be the person i want myself to be. I'm over feeling lost in life, and like I want to drop out of college, even though during moments of clarity, I know college and scientific motivation has always been of utmost importance to me. Im tired of sacrificing vital opportunity to create meaningful relations with girls and guy friends, because getting high or coming down was more important at the moment.

&#x200B;

I feel like I need a support group, or people to talk to who are in the same situation - but can't seem to find an NA meeting that fits my school schedule.

&#x200B;

I use to deny being an addict, and think that I can do any drug or anything without any repercussions - however, today, without drugs present, I find myself binge eating food, smoking nicotine constantly, or just urging to find dope in some way. All these things said - at the end of the day, I truly don't want to use. I want to get out of this vicious cycle, that has only benefitted me with superficial beliefs that it is actually benefitting me. It has never advanced me in life.

&#x200B;

I transferred schools, and am in a bachelor program now. Have been here for a month, used the first week, and was 3 weeks clean, then drove back home (2.5 hours away) last week to get more dope.. out of literal urgency to get high. I dropped everything, bailed home, and drove back the next morning. As soon as i get the thought in my head that It is feasible to go get dope, its like i can't shake that feeling and i get tunnel vision on getting that dope as my highest priority. its so psychological its unbelievable. I feel so drowsy, and unmotivated in the mornings, without dope, even during the later part of those 3 weeks i was clean.. i don't get it. I have suboxone, but am almost out.. they help with the energy, but they don't last forever.

&#x200B;

How have you guys dealt with this in the past? Can anyone relate to this? I feel trapped. I feel like i want a psychiatrist to prescribe me anxiety meds, and focus meds, so i can curb the feelings that make me want to use dope in the first place... but then I also don't want to get caught in a further circle of drug use... anyone have any insight? What has worked in the past? Do feelings of sexual deficiency come back to a natural state after stopping use? Can you feel happy, and not urged to use after gotten clean?",1540171308.0
9q90mp,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9q90mp/best_heroin_story_i_ever_read/,57,https://redd.it/9q90mp,missilesarefun,Best Heroin story I ever read,"I feel as if I'm in warm water, rising, ascending rapidly toward the surface. I can see the light at the top, filtering down, its getting closer. I don't want to reach it. I don't know why but I'm terrified. And then I hit the surface, I gasp for breath, open my eyes... I'm lying in bed, covered in sweat. It soaks through my sheets. I left my window open last night, and the cold morning air stings my skin. Now I remember why I didn't want to reach the surface. To wake up. To face the day. I slept in, I realize, looking at the clock. I'm already sick. I rip the covers off, nausea rises in my stomach. The eyes water, that sick metallic taste lingers in the back of my mouth.... I should have saved something for the morning... I pick my cell up off the floor. 15 missed calls. All from S. I call him back.¬†

'Hey man, your still down to go right???'He's trying to hide the panic in his voice. 'Yeah, don't worry' I say, 'I'll be there soon as possible' I stumble to my feet, pull some dirty jeans on, the denim hurts the skin on contact. I pull a shirt on, and its immediately soaked with my sweat. I've been wearing these clothes for 6 days now, haven't showered in just as long. My hair and skin is greasy, my face scattered with zits. I eat half a banana, feel like puking, and throw it into the yard as I walk out the door. When withdrawing my walk takes on that of an old man.¬†

I hobble out to the car. Its at the end of my driveway. it seems like a mile. I'm glad to just sit and drive, although now the sickness is getting to the next stage. My bones feel bruised, my legs radiate with dull aching from the bone out. I drive like a madman. 20 minutes later i arrive at S's house. I can't get out of the car. I honk.¬†
He comes hobbling out just like me, quick as he can, and jumps in. He looks at me, eyes wide and frantic, pouring sweat, and screams. 'AAAHHH!!!! FUCK! Lets go, PLEASE, PLEASE!!!' 'Alright! Alright! I'm going!' I back out and tear down the road. S starts laughing. He still has a sense of humor. 'I'm sorry dude! BWWWAAAAH!!!' - his signature sound. 'I'm just so fucking sick... Don't have much cash either its looking pretty grim.'¬†

'well I'm broke dude, you know that. All I can do is drive' I say. S had been buying bags and kicking me shots for like 2 weeks now, 'cause he has no car and I drive, every so often I get extra cash and can actually get high, instead of just getting 'well'.¬†
I drive toward Portland. Soon we hit the freeway, and as if on cue S grabs my phone and dials. He uses his very slow, precise speech so the Mexicans can understand. 'Hey buddy, I be there soon where can I meetchu? --- street and --- street, 2 north 1 east?' I automatically start memorizing the location, saying it over and over in my head. 'ok 10-15 minute? ok buddy' S hangs up.¬†

For the next 10 minutes we don't speak until we get to the spot, we drive to the designated intersection, then go 2 blocks north and 1 block east, like they said, parking in a residential neighborhood. And the waiting game begins. the worst part. 15 minutes go by, they aren't here yet. We call, they say 5 more. 8 minutes later we call again, they say 5 more! We wait another 10 fucking minutes, getting pissed. I pick up the phone about to CRY I'm so fucking sick. As I'm dialing the numbers S yells. 'LOOK! THERE THEY ARE! LOOK! LOOK!' I drop the phone.¬†

The Mexicans are coming down the block towards us in their old blue car, they smile and wave as they pass us. I flip a U-turn, my tires screeching. Finally, I think, FUCKING FINALLY. We follow them a few blocks, until we get on a block with not many people outside. Theres only one guy outside, mowing his lawn. He doesn't take notice as the Mexicans pull up to the curb, and I do the same. S jumps out and runs up, jumping into their car. I follow them again, 2 blocks down. then they slow, S jumps out, and runs back to my car, jumping in, out of breath.¬†

'SHIT YEAH! THANK GOD!' He yells. 'Lets go! Lets go to somewhere with a bathroom dude, quick!' I hate doing this, but we can't wait to get all the way home, we're too sick now. But the sickness seems to subside just a little knowing that I'll be well soon. I grin uncontrollably, but I'm filled with sadness at the same time. If my girlfriend and my family could see me now... God. S has 5 different colored water balloons sitting in his lap. Its a chunk of tar, wrapped in plastic, then a water balloon, for $10-$15 each. He told me he didn't have much money, I think to myself.¬†

He opens 2 balloons and starts breathing onto the powder to make it turn to tar. Soon he has 2 pea sized chunks of gooey, black, vinegar smelling tar wrapped in plastic. He hands one to me. He's generous today. 'Thanks for driving, man' he says. 'No, thank you' I say, 'I don't know what I'd do without you.' I pull into the parking lot of a big store and park. S hands me a clean rig, we fill them up from a bottle of water off the floor of the car. Then we get out, I don't even lock the car I'm so anxious, and we both power speed walk towards the store. By now my entire body aches, my skin stings, my stomach is turning over, my bones feel like their on fire. I would be crying in agony if it weren't for the fact that I know I'll be high in 3 minutes. S and I get inside the store, acting like we don't even know each other, and head for the bathrooms.¬†

We each go into a separate stall. I pull an old spoon out of my pocket, and place 3/4 of my balloon inside. Then I squirt the water from the syringe into the spoon, and begin cooking it. my hands are shaking, I nearly spill some. Soon the tar, black as night, melts down into the water, turning to a brown puddle. The bitter, vinegar like smell fills the bathroom stall. I worry about people outside the stall smelling it, but theres just one old man at the urinal out there. I tear a small peice of cotton off of a cotton ball I had in my pocket, and toss it into the brown sludge. I watch the cotton soak up the liquid, until its consumed, sitting in a small puddle. I stick the end of the needle into the cotton, and draw back,sucking the entire contents into the syringe. A dark brown mixture, filling 1/3 of the 1 cc syringe. I cap it, and take off my belt, wrapping it tight around my left arm.¬†

This is the part I hate, I don't understand people who enjoy this. I slap my arm a few times, and a large vein reveals itself at the crook of my elbow. I pull the cap off the rig with my teeth, and slowly begin sliding it into the vein. I hear S grunt a few stalls down, and mumble 'mother fucker, fuckin thing'. My right hand, holding the spike is shaking, it takes me two tries, till I feel that 'pop' of the needle entering the vein. I draw back the plunger, it fills with a crimson mushroom cloud, the deep red overtaking the brown mixture. My stomach turns over, my heart pounds in my chest, this is gonna be a big one. I loosen the belt around my arm and push down the plunger, slowly, careful not to let the needle pop out, missing shots is horrible. Then, its done. I pull the needle out, cap it, place it in my pocket.¬†

I put my belt back on. But the whole time I'm counting, subconsciously, 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, and then WHOOOSH, I feel the warmth, emanating outward from my chest and deep in my head, I feel a tingle deep inside my being, like being on the verge of an orgasm. My eyes close, all on their own, my body seems to sink into the opiate. The warmth takes over, eradicating the sickness, and I'm glowing. I feel ten feet off the ground... my god, its almost too good. I wobble on my feet, my eyes closed, having trouble keeping balanced. Suddenly I hear my name. Where am I? I open my eyes, oh yeah its S calling my name, but I don't care, I'm in a blur, a beautiful merciful blur. I feel like I'm in a warm bath. For a second, I almost forget the hassle of the day, and that I'll have to do it all over again tomorrow. I step out of the stall and see S waiting for me, a slight smile on his face. 'Man,' I say, ' I don't wanna do this anymore, I wanna get clean.' S is nodding out, standing there. He shakes his head around trying to come out of it. 'Huh? Oh yeah. Yeah I know dude,' he says, ' We all do. Come on man. Lets go home.'¬†

I'm curious if anyone knows precisely what's happening though. If I clearly register and push in verrrry slowly, why is it that the vein can't handle it if it is already pumping blood? Is it maybe that the vein is just borderline functioning and the moment the cocaine solution enters it, it destroys them (through acidity? force of the needle combined with structurally compromised veins?)?

Any harm reduction advice/ideas of ways I can avoid this happening but still manage to get the shots to actually work (I just get the delayed effect of a subcutaneous/missed shot, as expected, from most of my shots). I'm trying to go for different areas but even new ones seem to react in a similar way. 

I know even in the mid term the only answer is to quit. I'm essentially going to rehab in a month and am committed to getting clean then, but I want to continue until that point.

This dealer said they were strong so I assumed they were pressed because people don‚Äôt usually say a pill is ‚ÄúSTRONG‚Äù in comparison to the normal supply... The imprint was ‚ÄúCDN 80‚Äù and when I googled that which pretty much said I had a guaranteed Fent pill. I broke it in half and then in half again so I tried 1/4 of the pill which was hard AF to break. I ended up feeling a decent buzz but I threw up about 4 times in a hour. I felt good after throwing up each time but I would swig some beer after and immediately throw up again and I was on my first beer of the day. I didn‚Äôt feel anything close to the normal Oxy high but it was a different kind of social buzz, I would obviously prefer pure oxy pills but can someone tell me if they feel a different high on fent cut substances? Is it pretty much impossible to drink on fent? I‚Äôve never thrown up on oxy and I‚Äôve mixed heavy drinking and adderall with oxy for the past few years and now on my first time trying this pill, I kept throwing up. I know fent is way stronger but I still did 1/4 of the pill which should equate to about 20mg, but I‚Äôve been prescribed 60mg oxy everyday for years with zero issues... if fent is still an opiate then why does it feel so different than Oxy? Do other users here feel that Pure H feels better than stuff cut with fent? I‚Äôve tried pure H that I tested and had zero fent in it but I don‚Äôt wanna go deep down that road. I got this pill for super cheap, less than 40 dollars, but I know people who take 3 of these 80s I tried everyday and they say throwing up is just a phase of that pill.

I started on subs 4/5 weeks ago to come off of a dihydrocodeine habit - may seem overkill but it was a pretty huge habit and I‚Äôm in no state to handle it on my own at the minute. I get it supervised through the week but get my weekend doses to take home. After a couple of weeks i started saving some of my take home doses, 4mg a weekend, to have some lines through the week. I didnt think this would make much difference.    
   
But on friday, i went to my therapy session at around 20 past 11 in the morning, after taking my sub at 11 sharp. I know this sounds late but i normally pick it up around that time, or even later (12-1) sometimes. I did cycle there really fast but as soon as i got there i felt really sick and had to go to the toilet, sat down to shit and started vomiting as well and sweating all over. I basically went into full withdrawals, right in the fucking toilets at the therapy place... fml. Anyway the sub started to work slowly after about half an hour and i got a lift home, and jumped into the shower. I felt fine for a bit, then vomited again but pulled around after smoking a little spliff. I actually didnt sniff any bupe that day til about 7pm.     
   
Yesterday, i woke up and felt a bit ill again, anyway went for a shit again and knew it was coming. So i shoved my sub under my tongue and waited in the shower for it to kick in but it didnt save me quickly. Still ended up vomiting for about 30 mins to an hour. Pretty much straight. There was a lot of yellow bile and a bit of blood (thought the blood was just down to all the retching though).    
   
Today, i woke up and went into withdrawals really quickly. Didnt have time to have a shit, just started the retching as soon as i got to the bathroom. It took me a fucking long time to stop vomiting for long enough to let my sub dissolve. I managed to kinda do it eventually, just stuck it under my tongue and went in the shower again. But the bit that concerns me is, it seemed like there was a lot of blood today. I dont know whether it is blood - but i was puking some really dark brown/red stuff, looked like blood mixed with bile maybe. But there was so much fucking red in it, i didnt get a really good look cos i was starting to get faint but im fucking sure that is not meant to come out your body.    
   
Tldr; Im really just asking whether anyone has any experience of sniffing bupe causing withdrawal to onset quicker, or whether people think this might be something different.   
Thanks for any help people. And I‚Äôm thinking of calling the local on call doctors this afternoon, wanted to post here too. Ive just smoked a spliff and im heading to the spa to fucking chill out for a bit now i finally feel human.    
   
Also worth mentioning that this seems to get randomly worse through the day, like I‚Äôll get a bit sicker again midday and have to sit down. Ive partly remedied that today with a bump of sub and that spliff but i still dont feel right, which makes me think it might be something else. Sorry for the huge ranting post, I just wanna know wtf could be going on!

He tells me to come around to the backside of his apartment complex, and I will see him in his window.

This confuses me because his window is on the second floor and there is no access to it. (no stairs etc)

So I'm standing there, freezing my ass off, in this dimly lit parking lot in the bad side of town, with my car parked around the front, blankly staring at his window directly up from me.

I text him ""yo dude I dont really know what to do from here...""
Suddenly the window opens up and a little coin purse comes slowly but surely dangling down on a fishing line. Mind you this is in a really burnt side of town and to anyone wirnessing this, it must of been the greatest thing ever. I look up at the window where I see him, in all his glory, holding a fucking fishing pole out the window, waving at me with his free hand. 

Trying not to laugh I open the purse and place my money in. I give him a thumbs up, and he reels in my cash like he's pulling in a 20 pound Salmon. 
It reaches him, he pulls it in and then moments later it comes dangling back down, with ny dope inside. I grab it, give him the thumbs up again, and walk back to my car.

&#x200B;

I have thought of things that could land me in a mental institution. I feel shame, regret, and anxiety every hour of every day. Many of those on here who have interacted with me before are probably saying ""that fucking guy deserves every bit of guilt he is feeling and worse"". What can I say, I don't blame you for thinking that way. I apologize, I do. My brain makes it impossible for me to let things go, to think positively, and to block out the grotesque images that flash through my mind.

&#x200B;

I abused a variety of drugs for a long time to escape the prison that is my mind. Stimulants, depressants, psychedelics, dissociatives, you name it. I thought it helped with my depression, anxiety, and ADHD but now that I've been clean from just about everything (I've had a few drinks, use my e-cigarette, and I have taken my prescribed adderall) for 4 weeks, I realize that all they did was help me bottle everything up. 

&#x200B;

I realize that I fucking hate myself and how terrible of a person I have been, and I realize now how hard it must be for my friends and family to deal with a negative, lazy, weird, disgusting fuck up like me. 

&#x200B;

I am so sorry. I feel crazy and alone. I thought that life would be easier once I got clean and got past withdrawals. I feel more mentally fucked up and anxious than I've ever felt before, which is stupid because everything is going well for me. I now have a great job, I'm moving out of my shitty house, I'm clean from all illegal substances, but my fucking brain won't let me be happy and it won't let me block these terrible images from my head. I realize drugs have truly fucked me up.

I'm sorry for venting and just for everything.

Please read this and offer up some advice if you can.","My life honestly depends on how I play my cards tonight. My fiance, child, and I live with my brother and his husband, and my mother. I have struggled with sobriety for years now. About 3.5/4 months ago my brother got a new job in California, and we all moved here. Up until the day I got on the plane to come here, I was kicked out of the house and separated from my daughter (who just turned 2 at the beginning of the month) and fiance, because I had relapsed. I was homeless and living on friend's couches for 4 months, after I had slipped up and had been using for about a year when my fiance finally told her therapist, who called CPS, and my fiance told my brother. 

Now, my brother is the most emotionally, mentally, morally, and personally abusive narcissist you will ever find. I'm a grown man, and I chose to do the dope. I fully acknowledge that. But you guys have now clue how hard it is to say sober when you have someone keeping you up until sunrise yelling at you about how big of a piece of shit you are, or telling you everything you do is wrong, from smoking weed in a recreational state, to the way you wear your hair, to going on a walk at night, to the way you raise your child, everything. And then goes to your fiance and make her choose between agreeing with him or having him unleash on her, too. Then makes gigantic deals over the smallest things. Literally, living with him almost makes sobriety impossible.

So recently, I fucked up and met a dealer. I've used for about two weeks now. Last night/today my fiance found a few QTips, each with one end missing its cotton, and found a piece of toilet paper with black soot from the bottom of my spoon, that was sitting in the toilet because somehow it hung onto the bowl and didn't flush. Now they are all losing their minds. I ended up getting the day off work today, but they all think I'm there now. I need to figure out a way to pass a home drug test, and I need to explain away the QTips. If I don't, I will be homeless and never see my daughter again. I even decided last night to switch back to my subs because it wasn't worth it a vowed to find a healthier way to deal with my stress. And then this happens.

I understand that I shouldn't have done it, and I totally get that I fucked up and no one else did it for me. Please, I don't need lectures right now. I have to have urine that will test positive for weed and not dope. I have a bottle of Quick Fix. And as far as explaining the QTips, I got nothing. Maybe I can say that's one of the muscle habits that stuck with me from being a junkie and that when I'm stressed I pull off the ends and roll them into little balls? Idk. Please, someone help me.

From my experience in rehab and NA, most people agree that you need to abstain from ALL drugs if you want to remain sober from the ones you wish. 
They say that relapse always starts with small usage like smoking weed and drinking alcohol. 

As a recovering opiate and benzo addict, I have so far found this to be true in my past few relapses. How many of you have been able to remain sober from the harder drugs that ruined your life but are still able to dabble in smaller shit like smoking weed and consuming alcohol? It may be a stupid question but I‚Äôm curious as to how many people actually are able to successfully do this.

Are we of any help to the community?,"Lemme start of by saying that i'm that guy. I come here (and to r/heroin) almost everyday to lurk, look at photos of different gear and read stories. It's almost like i need my curiosity for opiates filled in everyday with new shit.

I've been fascinated with poppies, needles and foils since i was young. My country had the worst heroin epidemic in europe in the 90's so i've seen a lot. IRL i've befriended some randos just to see them smoke or inject and listen to their stories and provide some comfort if i can. I used to carry around new needles (stolen from my mum, a nurse) to pass around because some users had this camaraderie thing around here and they all shared the same shit and it was nasty, with most of them getting hepatites over time).

Overall i find the rituals (and individuals) extremely interesting, although i always said ""no"" to heroin even on my darkest hours, because some of them really tempted me. Others were extremely protective of me and said that, around them, i would never smoke/snort/inject or they would beat me sensless lol.

At some level, i think i need to see opiates around. I need to know that they're here helping people. I also need to constantly made aware of the dangers so i don't go through that path. I think the community of users and ex-users around here is a great deterrent for others like myself, so i guess a ""thank you!"" is in order.

He gets in my car and first thing I notice is the bag looks bigger than a quarter g, so I hand him the money and he says, ""it should be 80"" and I told him I only ordered a quarter g and he says he swore I said a half g. So I pull up my phone and sure enough I was right. So I give him the bag for him to split it up, he splits the bag the drops half of the tar in no man's land in my car. He just says fuck it and dips. I get home, search my car for 10 minutes and sure enough find the quarter g piece.

Since I have such a high metabolism I started having withdrawals (aches/pains, anxiety, yawning, excessive tearing up in my eyes, etc.) after only eight hours of not using h so I took the sub at 8:30 this morning.    I cut it up into three pieces and took it in thirty minute intervals. 

At first I felt a little better, but wasn't feeling the relief I expected. I tried to go to work but was sent home because I could barely stand up. I was craving h so bad. So since I didn't have to work I decided to help one of my dealers out and take her to do some drops in exchange for gas money and h.

Since being home I've felt pretty great, I've smoked a little tiny more h but I only felt physical relief and wasn't getting high. I'm not really craving h right now I just feel kinda normal. 

I feel like the sub I took had lost most of its potency from being out of its package for so long or maybe I took it wrong by cutting it up? Because I only felt serious relief after smoking a little h. My boyfriend expected me to take this sub and be able to get through heroin withdrawals for the next few days then stay clean for a couple weeks and save money.

anyway i was in jail for about a month and then my girl bonded me out. i met a new plug in jail but ill get to him in a bit. she had to go to work when she bonded me out and obviously i just wanted to get high so i called my old plug. he knows i went to jail and has him meet me at his buddys house in the hood and strip searches me. doesnt find anything and lets me get my bag and go. a day or so later i deleted his number bc im sick and tired of being a junkie and going to jail and doing nothing with my life. plus i never really liked him. a lot of my dealers over the years ive become friends with, but this dude is just a straight asshole. i even heard him say ""i dont care if all yall motherfuckers OD and die. which is dumb bc there goes his income. so ive been out of jail for about a month doing pretty well, ive slipped up a couple times but im not too worried about it. i just cant get to the point where i NEED it everyday ever again. i dont want to be a slave to any substance. 

so i get off work yesterday and come home to relax. my girl and my sister go to the grocery store and i stay home with my 8 year old niece. im sorta half asleep bc i work for a landscape management company and my job is tough. all of the sudden my niece comes in and says ""theres a black man at the door for you"" i thought it might be my new plug i met in jail bc i owed him some money. but it wasnt, it was my old plug. keep in mind ive only seen him once since i got out of jail and the whole strip search thing rubbed me the wrong way. so hes standing there in my door way with his 9 tucked in his waist like always. and he starts up with this story. ""so the feds kicked in my door , yeah they didnt find shit though just bags and scales. then he looks at me and asks me if i rolled on him in jail. its cold outside and i dont have a shirt on and im also terrified of getting shot so im shaking pretty badly. i explain to him that im not on probation or anything, and yes this is a felony but in my state they are going to offer me prob 3-5 years of probation. im not a huge fan of probation but im not gonna roll on someone to the feds to save my own ass. if i got jail time or whatever i would just take it like a man. and then he starts asking me about my buddy who was in the car with me and also got arrested. he got arrested for VOP and also they charged him and me with the bag they found in the car. his story is a lot different. hes on first offender probation for some bad charges, and considering he VOP'd with a new felony, he is more than likely going up the road for a few years (to prison). and then my old dealer tells me that he has boys in jail who told him that the other kid asked to talk to investigators. which means hes probably rolling on me, the plug, anyone he can to save his ass. he finally starts to believe me and then gives me his new number, which i dont even want but it would look suspect to say no. 

and then my new plug shows up this morning to collect the money i owe him and he notices something is wrong with me so he asks if im ok. and i told him what happened. he said fuck that i would have called the police if that nigga brought that street shit to my house where my family stays and threatened me like that. this new plug is such a good dude im so glad i met him. he just gives me about a half g today of ECP but its rocked up, for free just bc he felt bad for me and knew i didnt have any money after paying him back. and tells me not to worry about paying him for it. ive only known him a month but hes already made at least 2 grand off me. i middle man for a lot of people that only like picking up from me. i know its all about money and shit for him but i think ill end up being friends with this guy too.

the one time i asked my old plug for a point on the front he charged me $55 for it. (i usually pay $20 up front) hes just all around a piece of shit and i cant believe he showed up to my house threatening me. and im a convicted felon so i dont even have any guns in the house. anyway sorry for the rant i just had to tell someone.",1540065006.0
9px4vs,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9px4vs/my_life_is_falling_apart/,20,https://redd.it/9px4vs,Kylerdub,My life is falling apart.,"My life is literally falling apart. Not in the way you would think either. 

So I recently quit all drugs to improve our chances of having a child. Which worked, I got my girl pregnant and everything was going just fine. 10 weeks in everything was perfect, I was proud of myself for staying sober for as long as I have (about 4.5 months now) and extremely excited to start this chapter in our lives. Than everything went to shit. My girlfriend started bleeding, so we went to the doctor and had tests done and it turned out we lost the baby. Nothing we could have done to prevent it, it's just something that happens sometimes. I had to keep an eye on my girlfriend to make sure she didn't start getting flu like symptoms or anything like that because there could be an issue with the body expelling the fetus. Gross I know but that's what happens. She seemed okay, until I get 12 missed calls when I finish writing an exam at school. So I call back and her mom answers the phone and tells me she is having emergency surgery to possibly remove on of her tubes because she could have ectopic pregnancy which can be extremely dangerous. 

Of course I immediately leave school, sit in the waiting room in the hospital for over 12 hours until 4 in the morning. (meanwhile I have a major exam at 8am) turns out they didn't have to remove the tube, but she had to have a D&C procedure. I decided to not go my my exam that day so I could be there for her because this is obviously hard for both of us but mainly her.  I did email my teachers but unfortunately there is no re writes for exams. She had to stay in the hospital for 2 days, and I didn't leave her side until I was able to bring her home. 

We get home and I get her settled and she is on lots of pain pills and stuff for the pain for the surgery. Since I'm sober now I didn't even think about taking her pain pills because she obviously needs them for her pain because she can barely walk or do anything for herself.  Before I got sober the piece of shit I was I probably would have taken some of her Dilaudid and shot it for sure. Not this time. 

In the midst of all of this I missed 3 crucial exams, and am now failing my courses when I previously was above 90% in all of my classes. Everything is just falling apart and all I can think of now is getting some pills or heroin and getting high, high as fuck and forgetting all of this. Forgetting that I just wasted over 10g on my course at my school since I don't think I can recover from this since my exams are worth 20-25% of my final mark, forgetting we just lost the baby we tried for 2.5 years to have. Everything. 

I got some kratom, I'm going to use that and hopefully push the cravings away from getting high but any word of encouragement would be great in this dark time of my life right now. Has anyone gone through something similar to this and any advice anyone can give me? I just feel hopeless. ",1540064702.0

It seems to me that highly intelligent people have a natural preference to the best drug out there, aka opium. No idea why anyone would be into anything else, but oh well. Anyways. Are there any people with a high-skilled job? All shows always show addict characters as cool, sophisticated high-achieving people with money, doctors lawyers nurses etc. 
I‚Äôm a software engineer myself. 
Well truth is that I am not an active addict not have I ever been, but I have a super addictive obsessive personality, so if I had permanent access, oh boy. Luckily though it would have to be access to a script/Pharma drugs because the OCD part of my brain would only let me do drugs that are 100% clean. Even when I was able to buy a couple of pills I took 2 hours researching and looking at pics online making sure they look exactly how they should. Just paranoid of any chemical out there on the streets. Anyways. I don‚Äôt have any dealers that sell pharmaceuticals (or any dealers at all for that matter) so I never became actively addicted - which is great because even with a good job those pills sell for a crazy amount of money. I did a few calculations for fun, and I‚Äôm pretty sure even those fictitious well-paid characters would run out of money feeding their daily habit. A top corporate lawyer in NYC would make 500k annually, but I think you‚Äôd still need a few millions in the bank rolling and in investments to keep income super high regularly, but with just a salary of 500k coming via regular paychecks - you‚Äôd not make enough. You need to literally be a trust-funder. Only a money-making-money amount would support a pure pill habit. And that blows. ",1540063870.0

No tiny shot, no rinses, nothing. I had some suboxones but my last shot was only twelve hours ago and I'm not trying to deal with that right now.

I was getting money at 11:30am; it was 9:00am when I woke up. Two and a half awful hours between waking up and getting well. I had talked to my Main last night and explained the situation. He fronts me often and I currently owe him 140$(due on Monday) but he still sells me sacks until then. He told me last night to hit him up when I get up and if hes awake before I get the money he'll help me out before.

So 10:00am rolls around and I've sent him two texts, he responded with a simple ""Sure, Ross parking lot in 20mins"". And sure enough I was there in 19mins and he was waiting for me. I pull up next to his black Toyota and we exchange a pack of cigs; the sack enclosed inside.

He cracks a fat grin which I've legit never seen him smile in the two and a half months of our buisness relationship and says ""I threw in some extra for you"", and the sack was legit twice the size it should be. Instead of .3 for 40$ which is normal he hooked me up with .65-.7 for 40$ and I didnt even have the money on hand to pay him this morning and he still hooked it up fatter than hell.

This dude is awesome, I snatched him up by my middle man calling him on my phone one day. My phone low key saves all the data outside the call log so even though my middle cleared my call log the number was still saved. I sent him a text explaining who I was. What I wanted. And why i would be worth his time. (I spend roughly 400$ a week on dope, not anymore but used to). It's been awesome since then.

Waited 20 hours to take suboxone and no matter how much I took I didn‚Äôt get relief. I know I waited long enough.

It wasn‚Äôt PWD because things didn‚Äôt get worse. And even if it was, I didn‚Äôt get relief the next 3 days. Last year I kicked for a little over a month with a rapid sub taper and it was relatively easy. But that was when I was just using oxy. Shit was getting expensive and harder to come by and decided to start buying presses 7 months ago like a fucking idiot. I gave up yesterday morning at the 84 hour mark. I had lost probably 7 lbs from not being able to eat and could hardly use my legs to get up to go to the bathroom. This was WITH subs. And I swear that honestly I would feel worse after dosing a sub.

I was eventually put on 20mg Oxymorphone 3x day and Hydromorphone 8mg 4x day. Great pain relief, great sleep and nods.
Then around the beginning of the last year, I start having major tolerance issues - 60mg Oxymorphone and 32-64 Hydromorphone wasn't even giving me as much as a feeling in my chest.
  
Then this year I asked my Dr to switch my ER from Oxymorphone to Fentanyl for insurance reasons. As per usual Dr starts Fent dose at 25mcg and over the course of 3 months, my dose is titrated until I reached 100mcg. I still have my 8mg Hydromorphone too but they I receive no relief for pain. 
  
I've done semi tolerance breaks for weeks at a time, keeping half a fent patch on and no hydromorphone. Sometimes after a week my tolerance feels fixed other times it does nothing.
  
Id also likes to point out that my ROA for Hydromorphone is intranasal 53% vs oral 35%. I have noticed pretty bad post nasal drip lately which I thought may be hindering the drug from absorbing via nerve and mucus instead.
  
I guess my main question is how have others on this board managed to bring down their high tolerance down, via other methods than just a break tolerance break, while still being able to relieve their pain?
Did you make any plans with your Dr in using Clonidine or using it in conjunction with a tolerance break?
  
  
Also, was me asking to switch to the fentanyl patch a mistake here? Have there been reports of others having a lackluster response to fentanyl patches via transdermal?
  
  
I'd really like to hear how chronic pain patients have managed to bring their tolerance down and stability to their pain level again.

So i go to the appointment and walked out with a sub RX. I told the doc i was reluctant to start subs and after about 20 min he had me turned around on the idea that i would be replacing one with another.  He told me that I shouldnt think of it as getting on another drug, but that im making a committed effort to stop using heroin. he told me that everything i know about subs and using them as a tool to kick is learned from the streets and most likely from people that were not truly committed to their recovery. 

&#x200B;

So when i got home i talked to my fam about my plan to start with the subs and i felt that they thought i was just trading up heroin to get high with subs. But thats not the case by any means. I felt like they had kinda passed judgment on me over it. like they had just walked in on me with a needle in my arm slumped out.  I didnt even know that he was a doc that could give out a sub RX. 

&#x200B;

CORRECT ME IF IM WRONG PLEASE, but subs dont get you high correct? Im looking for the help in taking cravings away as well as the blocker so i cant get high even if i tried. 

&#x200B;

it really upset me though that they took that type of attitude with me.  I checked myself in to rehab detox and i made the appointment w my doc not to get drugs but to address shit that needs to be addressed. they asked me why na wasnt enough and why i thought subs would help me and how it was actually going to be different. I dont feel that i am a bad person because i am an addict, i just dont know if my fam feels the same. despite all things i have done for them and helped economically and various other ways all i am in their eyes now is a drug addict and nothing more. i have a masters degree and own my home and the one my parents live in. like i said, im not a bad person because i like to get high. 

&#x200B;

i told them i didnt know if they would help but i was going to listen to the doctor who has experience prescribing and helping people like me. im at the point where i am tired of this shit and I need to change. the addict in me says dont take the subs cause i wont be able to get high and that i should keep on keeping on with dope.  I know that it is the disease that is telling me to say fuck the subs and not get that help.  cause i really do feel powerless in it and im hoping to get some of that power back through the treatment.  

&#x200B;

Anyone have a similar experience? any advise on how to deal with them would be appreciated.  Im not excited about starting subs, but i am willing to do what ever it takes at this point cause i am a fucking addict and i want to make shit better for myself. I plan on taking them as the RX instructs and also refrain from other drugs.  I start an iop program monday and im hoping that will help me as well. 

&#x200B;

I know this is kinda a shit post/rant but i have systematically eliminated anyone that will or could hold me accountable for my addictions by moving to a new place. so i dont really have many to talk to and my fam is supportive but doesnt really understand what is going on because they are not and never have been addicts.  kinda sad to think that i gotta reach out to blank faces through reddit to voice my shit..

&#x200B;

if anyone reading this can relate or has something to say to me about it i would very much so appreciate it. 

&#x200B;

im just trying to make moves forward to better myself. i understand that i cant make this shit work for me anymore and that i am not only better off with out it but that all my problems are based around dope. or at least about 99% of them.

&#x200B;

so im not gonna leave my house and go get high right now. im gonna sit here and do nothing cause i know im better off at home in my home where i am safe and most certainly not going to relapse if i stay in place.

hope everyone is having a good night.. take care all.

I‚Äôve been struggling the last 4 months or so. Maybe longer. Getting clean for a couple weeks or a month or so but then relapsing. I know that some do not consider taking suboxone or Subutex as being clean but at this point in my life I need it. I‚Äôve tried using Kratom to keep off the dope but it never really workEd. I never decided to get clean for myself it was always for someone else or some other reason... 

I relapsed a couple weeks ago and I‚Äôm beyond done with this shit. Luckily for me, my psychiatrist is licensed to prescribe Suboxone. I have my appointment on Monday at 2:30... 

Anyways, my question is ultimately this. I cannot stand the taste of suboxone, the smell alone makes me want to vomit. Not only that but I seem to get some wicked headaches from suboxone that I do not get from Subutex. If I tell my psychiatrist this, would it be possible to get prescribed Subutex instead of Suboxone? 

I plan on taking the suboxone or Subutex or 7 days before I hop into getting sublocade... my end goal is to ultimately get back onto Vivitrol. Now if I can endure 7-10 of complete abstinence from all opiates and kratom then I can hop right onto Vivitrol...

Things are better now, so I finally made the appointment to get an implant.  Replacing a tooth with an implant involves screwing a post into your jawbone, I would estimate about an inch or so deep if the pictures they showed me are to be believed, then attaching a crown to that when it heals.  

Turns out I have enough bone in my jaw to do this, yay!  Cost is $2300, I assume another $800 for the crown.  I doubt if insurance will pay for any of it, but I've been wanting it for a long time and I work hard for a reason.

So the doctor was evaluating me, explaining to me how it works, and asked me if I had any prescriptions.  I told him about the tramadol I get for my back.  He then tells me that since I take an opiate he won't write me a script for any more.

I'm actually cool with that.  I don't take all my tramadol every month so I have plenty, and they work great with me.  But... what if I weren't in this situation?  Tramadol work no better then aspirin for my husband.  What if that were the case for me?  I'm kinda a wimp and I doubt I would go through with having a chunk of metal screwed into my skeleton without any pain relief.

I was extremely upset and without even really thinking about it I found myself in the locked bathroom mixing up a shot. And I‚Äôve been shooting up every day, multiple times a day, since that day. Generally a bit more heroin in the shot every time if the amount of my stash permits me too atleast. Each time I push down on the plunger I‚Äôm hoping this is the one that finally does it.. this is the one that finally is too much for my body to handle and takes me life. I‚Äôm not happy here.. and I don‚Äôt want to be here any longer. I had so many dreams and aspirations for things I wanted to achieve in life.. I‚Äôve given up on them all. I won‚Äôt get into it all because I‚Äôd be typing all night wasting your time making you read it. But basically I‚Äôm sick and tired of being sick and tired. I live at home with my parents and little brother. He‚Äôs only a year and a half younger than me, growing up we were literally inseparable. I loved him more than any other person in the world.. actually I still do even tho I‚Äôd never admit it to him or anyone else now. Why? Because he hates me. Has for some time now. He‚Äôs only spoken to me once in about 2 years until earlier this week. That one time was one sentence ‚ÄúI will kill you‚Äù. Now I know he never would because he‚Äôs going to med school and would go want to ruin his life but it gave me a glimpse into his current psyche, while he wouldn‚Äôt actually kill me himself he secretly wishes I was dead. Doesn‚Äôt matter how it happens, he just wants me to die already. Before he told me that I tried talking to him numerous times in an attempt to fix things between us, even offered to stop all drug usage if that was his problem with me(he‚Äôs never told me the exact reason why he doesn‚Äôt speak to me anymore despite me asking numerous times), but he has no interest in fixing things between us, has no interest in speaking to me ever again or having any kind of relationship with me ever again. Earlier this week he came out of his room while me and my mom were arguing over something more debating I guess neither one of us was yelling or anything like that we just disagreed on the subject and told he interjected to tell me to shut up. As soon as I went to respond my dad blew the fuck up on me, yelling cursing calling me all kinds of names and telling me all kinds of different fucked up things I‚Äôd rather not repeat. No one told him to stay out of it, no one told him not to speak to me that way, no one told him anything. Because he is going to become a doctor and I‚Äôm a disappointment. He is valued much more than me. In fact I‚Äôm not valued at all, I‚Äôm a burden something they‚Äôre stuck with and wish they weren‚Äôt. Almost every day I‚Äôm yelled at and told all kind of fucked up things. Well by my dad atleast.. my mom doesn‚Äôt even speak to me most of the time sometimes goes literally weeks without saying a word to me. The sad part is I‚Äôm even used to it by now. And when she does it‚Äôs usually complaining about how much of a burden I am. She doesn‚Äôt love me.. but then again none of them do. None of them value me at all. None of them even want me around. So why should I want to be around if none of them want me to be?? I‚Äôm no angel or perfect by any means but I try my best to be nice & respectful to everyone... literally the only flaw I have that someone could point out is my substance abuse issue.. and even with that I don‚Äôt hurt no one but myself. And it‚Äôs not like I do it for fun... I haven‚Äôt got high for fun in a long time now... at this point I‚Äôm only getting high to escape my misery for a bit. Every night I go to sleep hoping I don‚Äôt wake up. To my disappointment I always do... maybe through shooting up I will finally be put out of my misery. It‚Äôs hard waking up knowing nobody loves you. Idk why I‚Äôm telling you guys all this I guess since I have no one else too.. I‚Äôm sorry for wasting your time.. I just can‚Äôt take it anymore..",1540006312.0

Then he cut me off, saying he was no longer prescribing narcotics. I ended up reading in the paper that he was being investigated for knowingly prescribing opiates to patients that admitted to selling their scripts. At my last visit, he referred me to a new pain management doctor, which was cool, but they couldn't see me until early November. I've been clean and sober since early September and just waiting for that appointment. Hell, I obsess over it...
     In the meantime, my primary doctor put me on a second antidepressant. I already was taking 20mg of Lexapro for my anxiety, but she added 150mg of Wellbutrin to that to help with my increasing depression. Everything online says there is a risk of interaction, and I can't seem to find a straight answer. I am just concerned the new pain management doctor won't give me percs any more because of the Wellbutrin. Is there a significant risk for seratonin syndrome or anything else I should be concerned about? When I have percs, they do more for my depression than the Wellbutrin seems to be doing, so if it's gonna hinder me getting them, I'll stop it.

A HR lady came up and said we need to talk to you in the office. I knew it wasn't good since there was 4 supervisors in there plus the head of security.

They pretty much told me I was acting to happy and they wasn't like me apparently? Which is not true. They asked me if I'm taking any medication which I said yes i am prescribed 90 mg oxycodone x3 times a day. I offered to show them the bottle which they refused

I don't take the oxy at work only once when I wake up and 2 before bed. Needless to say they took me to a drug testing clinic. I couldn't believe this.

Regardless I wasn't able to pee as I just went before going. So they resorted to doing a oral swab test. Right after they gave me a breathalyzer test which was funny because I don't even drink alcohol.

I am prescribed oxycodone so I'm not worried about that
 I however did take a xanax 2 days ago which I snorted anyway but I still doubt it would show up

My question to u is I know oral saliva tests aren't very effective. Even if xanax does show up I'll just say my sister gave me one to help me sleep. I'm not worried about the oxycodone since I see a pain management docto

But I‚Äôve been learning how to live again being on Suboxone for about 5 months stable, just a few attempts to quit but no crazy Oxy binges like I used to do, I‚Äôve lost interest in getting high due to the price, the life that comes, etc..

But Pickle here has been putting himself out there to find a job but I‚Äôve had absolutely no success.

It's really hard to believe for a junkie like me.

No suboxone. No whiskey. No heroin. No weed. No kratom.

Nicotine? Caffeine? - Yes

Going from vicodin, to oxys, to opana, to heroin, to heroin/coke/whiskey. I just did a little work and got honest about some shit. Its amazing how much my life has changed. Going from homeless, to my own place, in a great city, in less than 18 months.

I hope this resonates with someone... I remember using oxys/opana/alcohol and making close to 100k a year. I remember sitting on my couch that I inherited from my parents, and wanting to buy a side table so bad. I couldnt do it. If I had an extra $50, you and I both know exactly where it was going. I was broke. The money went to one place. Fuck food. Fuck a table. It went One. Fucking. Place. Its amazing today that I actually have money in my bank account to buy the shit that I want. Something so simple, was an absolute impossible fucking task in addiction.

I love you guys. People have been there for me since the old days. I appreciate all of you, and hope you all the best on your journey.

Cheers.

It had occurred to me that I complained about work but shouldn't really be complaining too hard.

This time last year ish... oh my goodness it might've been this time last year. I tried going through my post history real quick to narrow it down but I think I remember this story possibly taking place this time last year because it was before I completely stopped getting subs through Cliff, it wasn't hard decision because he never had them even when he said he did or would anyway!


&nbsp;

What I do remember is that I had work on a Sunday and it was cold outside. I was beginning to ""turn"" as I had woken up for an early afternoon shift at work which ended around 8:30pm. 

I was beginning to turn and the shadow of being dope sick was rapidly moving across the lands of my mind's eye. Although I couldn't' get a couple of extra bags on credit or trade or something from Cliff the night before, I had woken up to one snorted bag or something to get me through work. I hardly got straight. After I was already no longer straight, my first symptom was the yawns followed by the overall sense of it being colder around me.


&nbsp;

For some reason, Cliff said he could give me a couple of bags... I forgot the exact convo but I probably had given him money for subs two days earlier which never showed and I would eventually be paid back in pills or dope. Anyway, that day Cliff offered two bags. So all I had to do was bike back home on my lunch break.


&nbsp;

It was a busy day, back to back customer action... didn't know how I was going to plot my escape, didn't really care about the plot. Just that it had to happen. No promises of ""40 minutes sharp!"" Must avoid being given that order. So I get my ass to my bike and drug closet and beeline out of the establishment. I get my ass on the main avenue, although it's only 6pm it is dark out. My bike ride should be no less than 17 minutes but could be as long as 30 minutes especially if I'm riding dope-sick. Still, on normal re-up days (unlike the one in this story) can do it in 17 minutes, especially if its' nice out and I'm unencumbered by a coat and stiff muscles. Even then I do well as I would often unload my backpack of everything except for a spare inner tire tube and a pump. On the good days he'd say ""the eagle as landed"" and I'd get 20 15mg oxys or buns of dope that I ordered earlier that day just when I needed it!


On this occasion, I get there and am gifted two little shit red bags. Whatever, should get me straight. I also went out of my way to find his sister and her male friend. Somewhere in the fray of rushing I did a line of dope inside and another outside on the deck in the cold wind. That was stupid, I don't remember losing much I didn't lose nothing. I then asked his sister's friend if he had anything and he did for $20. I didn't know it was crack. I used it in snorted form back at work.

&nbsp;

Yeah, I biked back to work in that cold with a $20 back of crack that I thought was heroin to really get me straight. I was gone for 45 instead of 90 minutes. My boy called me while I was at Cliff's house and I had to say I'd be back ... soon. He thought I abandoned my shift. Back then and to this day he still doesn't know why. Now that he will soon no longer be my boss, perhaps I could tell him but I'm weighing on the back burner.


&nbsp;


Anyway, I snorted the bag of crack before returning from a double-long lunch break that was misinterpreted as desertion.


Luckily, I did not get fired and I did not get pressed hard on the personal points of why I did what I did. I was a bit suspect overall at the the time, getting more flu than usual perhaps but mainly the visual.. occasions where I'd have red dry skin beneath my eyes from rubbing so much. This on my face, I could not cover up easily and was challenged to come up with some kind of explanation when it came up in small talk. Sometimes lotion would make it worse, so I would tell the truth in that regard.


&nbsp;

If I was engaging in this junkie behavior the prior year with the prior manager of my department, I would have be F-U-C-K-E-D, at the very least at some point not long after it would become evident that my days are numbered in some way or another. Probably would've gotten near maximum penalty below termination for this offense and then a spate of write-ups on anything and everything that could be used to build an strong HR case against me.

&nbsp;


I am thankful to them in ways they may never know. They being my manager and supervisor. Captain and first officer. My Picard and Riker as my supe is certainly no Spock. Come to think of it, more like Janeway and... Chakotay, I suppose this analogy will have to work. They both have tats. 


One time my supe and a higher manager asked about my eyes/irritated skin after writing me up for being late. Which the write-up itself was fair, I was late quite a bit to that point. But yeah, they were genuinely concerned and I had to just use my go-to reason and assure them all was well and make sure I avoid it in the future best as possible.


&nbsp;


Now they they are leaving, on one angle we may be happy not to have manager who tolerate frequent call-outs from certain employees. Granted, some people really play it up with doctor's notes and a few are genuine. With new management, I may lose the ten minute grace period we get for lateness. They may schedule me a shit ton of hours while bieng part-time. Good and bad.. good for money but bad if you're trying to develop other skills for a better job. The way I see that is, it'll get busy every holiday but there plenty of time during the slower months for busines.


On the other hand a new manager may give me 5 hours a week more than not. That would be worrisome but they probably wont do that because I rock. Still, shit.. change is probably coming. Sigh. I don't know what else to think until more details come to light such as who will replace my bosses.

This evening I was out for a walk with my dog and I don't know how it happened - I think I got a bit carried away and I lost my purse. I think I might've sat on a bench and I accidentally left my purse there. I had a bunch of needles and syringes in that purse and I'm fucking terrified about the possible outcomes in case someone found it. Some of the needles are used. I've been searching for an hour and still can't find it, and I looked everywhere so I suppose someone found it and took it. Now there's two possibilities: 1). someone stole the purse - and I hope he/she fucking did AND 2) someone took it and he/she is going to return it to the police station.

&nbsp;

I'm fucking terrified. I had my ID card in that purse and, in case someone is going to report it to the police, they will probably suspect me of shooting up dope. I don't shoot up dope and probably never will. I've actually never injected any drug myself. I'm a very casual drug user and by casual I mean DXM, weed, molly and some codeine here and there. I use the needles for self harm. I know it sounds stupid, but whenever I feel like shit I enjoy stabbing myself with needles because it makes the emotional pain more bearable. So I usually go outside,  try to find a dark and quiet spot where I can be alone and I start stabbing my flesh with needles. But if anyone found that purse (and someone surely did), they're going to believe I shoot up and I could be in great trouble. I hope that, whoever found it, is going to take the needles out before reporting it to the police. Or I hope he/she fucking keeps it, I don't need the money and I can go and get a new ID card. But I'm terrified about what could happen to me in this situation. Can I get sued for this? What could happen in this situation? Please someone make calm down.",1539973749.0

Throwaway for obvious reasons. Can someone shed some light on what kind of systems (if any) are in place to prevent filling prescriptions of narcoitics from multiple doctors in multiple states? I'm currently traveling between 3 states for work (Alabama, Arkansas, and Tennessee) on a regular basis. I have a PCP in each state in the event something happens with my condition that requires immediate action. 

I generally have the same doctor fill my rx in my home state, but I have had the others fill the rx on occasion over the last few years. Sometimes I will also end up having 2 of the doctors write the prescription, but in the past I have only actually picked up one to get filled.

Now my question is this - can I have all 3 (or 2 even) write the prescription for me each month and I pick each up and fill them in their respective state? I understand that my insurance will not cover it... and would probably rat on me somehow. The only 28-30 days things you know. But can I insurance one and then pay cash on the other 2? 

I know each doctor runs their individual check to make sure I don't have any other active prescriptions before filling it for me... but I believe (Could be wrong) isn't that within their state only? Or is there some national database? Or do the states communicate with each other? That's the first step of course. And given that I've had multiple doctors actually write the rx for me before, I'm thinking it may not be issue. 

The second step, and more of a concern, is with the pharmacies. Since I've never tried to fill a second or third rx within the 30 day period I'm not sure what to expect at all. If I try to use my insurance I have no doubt that it will get denied and bust me. But what if I pick up the written prescriptions and take them to a pharmacy to fill without using my insurance - or probably a pharmacy I've never used before so they don't have my insurance on file at all. Is there a national database that they look me up in via DL, SS#, etc? Or do they only check with the state database similar to PCP and then insurance (if I use).

Please advise. Thank you.

The federal rules limiting number of sub patients is counter-productive to the rhetoric we hear about fixing the problem.

If you have things that you are not supposed to have the moment you enter your room place the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign outside the door. 

Also I know you want to be messy and leave your contraband all over the place, or setup that table with all your vials, blow, clear, 52g of black, thousands of dollars worth of cash and take that I'm trapping in hotels picture and just leave everything there.

Maids will report 100% of what they see, and if you're lucky and I mean boy do you have to be lucky you'll get that maid who will steal your stuff and say nothing.

Even if you have the DND on the door, put your stuff away. There will be 24-48h well fare checks now because of the DND.

You could be like the guy who's friend opened the door while someone was hitting a meth pipe and hotel security walked by seeing everything.

They will not tell you anything is wrong, your keys will be deactivated. They will pretend it was an accident, have you come down keep you occupied getting new keys until Local PD comes and off you go.

Also if you do get that maid who steals your black, please don't come to security and sign a report stating the maid stole your ball of heroin.


Edit: One slipped my mind that's very important, some places still have balconies. Well cameras are watching these and any type of fucking around on these will have security at your door and your stay at the property is immediately ended.

Edit 2: Any type of burnt material that has been obviously smoked in the room. Like a lighter, foil with burnt opiates on it and your toot. If you are in a non-smoking you will receive a minimum of a 1000$ fine at a decent place. 

May or not be reported if no other contraband is in view. 

Edit 3: I know comments are kinda dark and off topic. My only goal is to provide all information I can to keep you safe in all possible situations I am aware of. ",1539947835.0

I am living at my grandparents home at the current moment until i fix my military health checkup, since life at home was hell i decided fuck it, time to leave. My parents thought that i am abusing codeine, since they found my filters that i left hiding instead of throwing them out because i was a lazy, depressed shit.

The one thing that left me curious is - i passed my military health inspections and urine tests, even though i took some codeine 2 days ago. They didn't even inquire me about any medicine use, they didn't find nothing. Yet the drug tests at the clinic did. Could it have been the huge, poppy bagel i ate before the drug test day? I asked the doctor, and she said it was ""impossible"". And now that i failed the test i will have to take another one on Thursday, since i'm meeting a girl who i believe is the perfect woman i'll ever meet in my life, and i don't wanna fuck it up by being an anxious, depressed shit that i was before i started using.

Are 4 days enough for codeine to completely leave the body? Could the huge, poppy bagel fucked up my test and my doctor is just a dumb shit? Thank you in advance, opi fam <3

Finally he replied with nothing that would make me suspect he was mad or anything. Finally he got home and asked me to come out to the table where he threw down the crunched up foils. He said a couple hurtful things and packed his backpack and told me I had 2 weeks to get out... I pleaded for him to come back and talk to me but he left. Wouldn't answer my texts or phone calls. I want so badly to be with him I will gladly get sober but he just won't talk to me. He has claimed that he loves me time and time again but I don't think this is the case because he just said 2 weeks and get out. I am absolutely devastated and crushed. I fucking love this man and he is acting like I use to hurt him. I have never stolen or used him for anything. We always split bills 50/50 yet he claims or feels taken advantage of. Both of our names are on our lease. What do I do and how should I approach him as far as wanting him to stick with me through this...

When at the end 10-25 units, it starts to burn similar to a miss, but it's definitely going into the vein. 

Is it because I need to rotate IV spots more? There's a fat vein on my right hand that I've been using religiously (4-7 shots per day for the last week) because it works really well.

Can it just be sure from too much use? If that was the case I figure it would hurt the moment I started pushing the plunger, not just at the end.

I ran through the black fairly quick (shit quality, started like glass and then went to straight syrup goo over a few days, foil trail was black and shitty,) and he offered some of his 'white' -- I immediately was remiss to try any of it knowing how easy it is to grab fentalogs and die from a bump. 

&#x200B;

After the black ran out I started doing tiny hits off the foil of the white. It never really got me high per-say other than just feeling well and the duration didn't seem to line up with any fent I've read up on. It was obviously mostly cut (it's a taste I've tasted in black before, probably a sugar or lactose)... what I'm wondering is what the fuck it could've possibly been. I'm at around 24 hours after my last dose with little to no feelings of W/D aside from some sleepiness, which is unusual after a few days on black let alone adding a few days on this mystery powder. Usually if I stopped black as abruptly as I did this powder stuff I'd be in a world of lame with mild W/D symptoms that can usually be curbed by kratom pretty well. 

&#x200B;

The powder has less itching, less euphoria, decently long legs (no feeling unwell even 12 hours after small doses), no vinegar smell, no marked sedation and didn't mess with my vision... none of these things aside from the less euphoria and no acetic acid smell lead me to look at fentalogs...

I have sever degenerative back problems, had surgery a year ago, now in PM. The doctor is condescending, and told me because I'm young, only 3 7.5 oxycodone a day should work. I've always had a higher tolerance but accepted what little help they offered. Last week I had a old lady sell me three 50mcg Fent patches because she needed money to move, and I've been taking small slivers of the patches and sucking on them to supplement my dosage. I'm literalltystill only on the first patch the sliver is SO small. My next appointment is Tuesday morning and I'm worried what will show up on my u/s if they test me. Does anyone know how long such low dosages of the Fent patch stay in your system for those urine screens? I've got like 10 of my oxycodone for Sunday/Monday so I can show in my screen.....

Second question, how do I finally get them to take my pain seriously and up my dosage? They make me a nervous wreck and act like everyone is looking for a high. i'm just trying to function properly. Been seeing them since February seems like I spend all this time for nothing.",1539892141.0

i'm an actor and recently booked a film gig where i'm playing a gal with a heroin problem. the only drug i do is occasionally coke, and i've smoked weed off and on for about ten years. i do drink a lot. i have no experience even being around anyone on heroin, i've only ever seen it portrayed in film or television. i want to do this role justice and play it honestly and was looking for any insight if anyone is willing to provide. i've already done some digging through old posts and i've found some things that i can use, but i just wanted to ask you all as a whole and see if you'd be willing to help me!

i just want to be able to think and react like a heroin addict and portray it as honestly as i can. i don't want to play a caricature of a person. this is going to be one of the more challenging roles i've had in a long time, so i'm excited for that but also a little intimidated by portraying something so unfamiliar.

i'm curious about thought processes and thought patterns. i'm wanting to know more about physicality... if i'm being too vague please let me know. i'm not exactly sure how to pose these questions. this is a first for me!

thank you in advance to anyone willing to answer such a personal question. i would never feel comfortable asking this in any other situation.

It's awkward because we all know it's a scourge, but like... It's also not this ultimate, holy grail of evil that Americans seem to think it is. I mean, lest we forget, clean heroin doesn't cause any organic tissue damage (unlike even medically prescribed amphetamines like Adderall). It's not neurotoxic, and in theory, if you took it responsibly, you could have it every day of your life and still live a long time. Arguably it's healthier than sugar and cheeseburgers if you wanted to really go deep into it.

There's so much misinterpretation about the opiate world. It's ironic I have to defend something like this, and have people tell me if I've taken it ONCE, I've ruined my life, and you might as well call it quits, which simply isn't the case. People are retarded.",1539889689.0

So I shared this story 10 months ago, and today is my 15 months so I figured I share this here as it may be more relatable.

So this happened a couple of years back, and it's one of those stories where you look back and think ""how the fuck?""

Anyways, I was fresh outta high school working for some dude from Isreal renovating this apartment complex from like the fuckin 1860's. I was paid under the table so i got handed cash at the end of every week.

I was pretty gone on heroin at the time, it was like finding the love of my life. A buddy of mine who I went to school with was from the hood and was selling some grade A 10/10 brown. I never really hit up this dude to just cop, we usually would get into some shit. Id drive him anywhere he needed and he'd throw me a few free lines of this nice 10/10.

As soon as we both meet up, i immedietely tell him he can drive so i can just chill after workin all day. I buy my usual $100 (whenever i got paid) and he throws me a free 20 (.1 g) of some different shit. Any dope he got was gonna be MINIMUM 8/10, so i just blew the whole 20. My eyes started watering as soon as i finished, and that bittersweet nasal burn was more intense than usual. Now it usually takes like 5-10 min of solid nasal burn before it subsides, and thats where the high REALLY fucking kicks in.

Literally 10 minutes later we're on the highway heading east, and I tell him im about to start vomiting. So he pulls over on the side of the highway so I can puke my brains out real quick. I get back in the car, and I felt so relaxed and content, basically reflecting where im at in life. As soon as we get to the light at our exit, im hangin out the window puking again. I didn't even care that people were staring at me, like we're in the fuckin hood this isnt unusual. Well everytime I finished puking, i was rewarded with the best high and the best euphoria of my life, so if I got nauseous at all, i wasn't hesitating to vomit.

I started to smoke what I bought, and thats when I started nodding out hard. He told me it wasnt a good idea do 2 different kinds, but like what does that mean? So once I actually decided I should just chill, we were bouncing around all these spots, hittin notes, hangin with some cool ass people for a minute. If you've every chilled with someone from the hood, then you understand its hard to grasp everything you do in a night because you're basically all over the place. I must've poked my head out of my window to puke every 10 minutes the whole fuckin night till about 4 in the morning. I don't even remember driving home, and its a solid 40 minute drive from the hood to my house.

Looking back, after being sober and all that, I cant even imagine how that couldve been enjoyable for anyone, but at the same time, I see what heroin does to your brain once you lose yourself on it. Every addict is different, and every person can handle more or less than the next guy, so it sure paints a clear picture on how bad things can REALLY get, and how much worse it can be if you keep following the path of addiction. Because any addict would know, its ALWAYS worse the next time around.

TL;DR: puked over 20 times in a night after railing a fat line of heroin, and still had a good time and enjoyed my high. DONT FUCKING DO HEROIN GUYS",1539879913.0

I‚Äôm opiate naive. The only opi I could get was BTH from the DNM (I would get pills but they are all fake there)

I figured I could ‚Äúmicrodose‚Äù heroin. Doing mgs at a time, and work up my tolerance till I would find it enyojable. But no

If I do too little I don‚Äôt feel anything pleasurable. If I do more I only get more sedated and queazy. Leaving enough time in between each redose does not seem to work for the purpose of feeling high. I just fall a sleep for 6 hours and wake up feeling awful

Doing an initial larger dose sends my heart racing, get super nauseous and disoriented. Just feels like shit

I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs just too powerful if you haven‚Äôt done pills before

Just snorted around 8mg in monkey water. Snorted half mL softly and held my nostrils shut while it absorbed. 5 min later I thought for a second I was going to faint while it kicked in. Then came the nausea. Now I just feel retarded, pukey, and shitty overall

The body is like dude wtf is this shit. I tried using in consecutive days. With multiple redoses to maybe get my tolly to an enjoyable level. Didn‚Äôt work

My doctor and I have went thru a huge list of different pain medications attempting to control it. The thing that's work the best is oxycodone 5-10 mg, but I feel guilty for it. Society says that you are a pos if you need opiates but I can't believe the change in quality of life between being on them and off them. It controls the pain and also fights off the chronic fatigue I've developed. I feel like I am able to live agian. My fear is if I am them I will become addicted and let the drug control me. Ways I'm looking to avoid this is using a kitchen lockbox thing I found on Amazon so I can't use more often than I am supposed to.

Questions I have for people experienced in opiates is how can I use them to increase my qol without losing myself? Is it worth doing na or some sort of therapy while on the drug to avoid letting it take over me? I personally don't mind the idea because the quality increase is immense, I love the idea of being at a point where I'm enjoying life agian and am not waiting to die. I just don't want to harm my loved ones like my biological parents did with a potential addiction.

""I can't treat you""

WHAT LOL

Then this dude gave me a 10 minute speech about Suboxone

The nurses then told me that everyone that takes opioids has heightened pain (which could be true if long term ABUSE, i dont fucking know)

Then they're like ""Go see our favorite neurologist, even if you don't have the money or your insurance won't cover it. ITS WORTH IT! ""

Ive already been to a neurologist. How do you think i got here in the first place

These people said my case is ""very complicated""

So how many doctors am i going to see? I am at 10 at this point.

That is NOT including physical therapy , chiro or accupuncture lol

This is pathetic

Every doctor that sees me just tells me to see someone else , which imo in this latest refferal was just their buddy .

PS: If you haven't read my past posts, ive been on Buprenorphine/suboxone for over 10 years, only Buprenorphine till' recently i was given Tramadol for extreme pain. 

This is hopeless . 

Do i write a  bad review for each doctor?

What the fuck DO i do? like ????????

My mom just had 3 surgeries,
My father's cancer has just returned


so now im stuck and i probably wont be able to see any doctors for a long while . as i dont drive . 



My sub doctor tried to give me Lyrica  , but i can't afford it, even with the coupon its over $140 . That would atleast calm me the fuck down temporarily . I forget to take Klonopin, or rather would only take it before bed . 

Neurontin aint that great

And the muscle relaxers are fucking garbage . atleast the ones ive tried. Soma is the best, but they're all still garbage.

Hopeless, utterly hopeless, i am legitimately better off possibly treating myself

BTW

I have received shots in my neck before 

So idk why this dude is ""uncomfortable""

Not only have i received them before but i received them on the first visit to a diff doctors office whom accepted my insurance at the time but now does not . 


Everyone is fucking sick and fucked up and only looking out for themselves

This guy that told me he couldn't help me and that i was too complicated LOL was a surgeon who ran the pain clinic at the local hospital . the Anesthesiologist was a fucking weirdo . 


so yes, i can blanket term say that , all doctors, for most problems, are fucking horrible, if you are me, if you're on suboxone and haven't already been receiving help or help from the right people . i just remember that things were easier 15 years ago when i was younger, eerything was easier and the doctors were much nicer in general tbh ",1539856100.0

Recently, I managed to get my hands on a few oz of codeine/promethazine. What sucks is that it‚Äôs pretty weak for me, even with zero tolerance. Since I knew it was weak, I potentiated it beforehand with Cimetidine. I chugged 3oz on an empty stomach and I didnt feel shit. I googled it and APPARENTLY codeine cannot be potentiated. Instead, the cimetidine actually makes the codeine less effective. So I just wasted the last of my drugs for fucking nothing, I didn‚Äôt even get a buzz. ",1539842224.0

I was going to try and detox with 60 mg of methadone( 20-15-10-5 then stop) but my dealer only had 4 at the time and said he'd be able to get more but unfortunately he couldn't. So I've been holding onto them and yesterday I woke up, smoked my last point of black and figured I'd take 20 mg so I wouldn't need to pick up more and save some money. Just to preface, I've only been using for about 2 weeks now(not in total, just since my relapse) smoking about 3 or 4 points a day. 

I've never taken methadone before but from what I've been told is that if you do get high from it, it isn't too enjoyable and is more sedating and long lasting. Well, I didn't get any kind of ""opiate"" like high from the 20mg i took yesterday and the 20 mg I took today. But holy shiit, I got a crazy mood boost. Almost cocaine like but without the stimulating effect. I was felt great, and was super talkative. I had to interact with a lot of people today and I was talking my head off(while usually I'm not too much of a talker) and a lot of people noticed and were remarking that I must've had a good day. and I also didn't get sick, so that was nice. Overall, it was really nice and definitely wasn't expecting that, anyone else experience something similiar to that?

She went through hell loving a junkie, and always trying to help him get his shit back together. No matter how hard he would try to push her away.  
I know her in passing, and she's always been nice, but we've only hung out once.  
I know she's pretty square, only drinks occasionally, plays a lot of WoW.  
I just don't know how she would feel about hearing from me. From one of ""those"" friends.  
I just want to tell her that I'm sorry for her loss, and that he was loved and will be missed.  
How can I be sure I won't just be turning the knife?  
How much could she possibly care what some punk loser thinks of the man she was with for 10 some odd years?  
Will she want to hear that he was loved, from someone like me? Someone else like him? Do I, did my relationship with him, represent the very thing that took him away from her?

So to the question, can I crush these Oxy ER 10mg and snort them like the Oxy IR 10mg?

Soooooo I began texting the dboys to see who was around. My fav guy was at work until 5:30 but one of my other guys was able to come by now. It was about 11am

So my husband and I decided to just spend $100 now, and hold onto the rest for whatever reason and I'm so glad we did. 

Dude shows up about 45 min later and says ""I'll give you 1.5 and you can owe me $50"" 

Ok that's cool. I should've known something was up then. This guy never fronts. 

Anyway, he leaves and I go to prep some shots when I realize its not dissolving and it's not drawing into the syringe easily. So I take a closer look, and it smells like chalk. 

Well, fuck.

I snort a little bit just in case to no avail. 

We are pissed. Obviously. 

It was around 1 ish o'clock so I texted my other guy to see if he would come out after work for $140. He said ok.

Thank God we didn't spend more money this morning!! Something told us not to for some reason. 

Dboy #2 got here at about 6:15 which was way faster than I thought he would, and hooked me up with 2gs for $140 (usually $100/g)

So in the end it worked out, thank the good Lord, because if we would've lost all our money I dunno how I would've handled it. 

Of course the first jerk off turned his phone off as soon as he left here so I can't even call him. I fucking hope he actually asks for the $50 so I can tell him to fuck off. ",1539818180.0

Did i not use long enough? Id say the mental part is the hardest part but I dont know if I can hurt my mother anymore I just think of her if I ever get an urge. How long does the mental part last for someone with an addiction like mine? I was fairly good at keeping my addiction at bay and I know my addiction is nothing compared to the majority of you guys.

I chased a tiny piece and left a trail, had it running way better than any #4 I've smoked before.

The second time I went over the trail the dope pretty well completely vaporized except at the end where there was a little glob that ended up getting a bit burnt.

Never had that happen usually the second time I go over the trail it just goes black.

Pictures are attached here http://imgur.com/a/3Olvx5X

It also gave me a real nice buzz for such a tiny piece especially for my tolerance being on a 70mg methadone dose so I'm pumped about that.  Anyone seen it vaporize like that going over the second time before (maybe it's normal and I'm usually getting lower quality) or have any idea what it could be?  Thanks !",1539805857.0

Wasted about a quarter g, so nothing excessive but still fucking pissed. Managed to salvage some, but now I got this tar covered in fucking doxyaline and all those fillings and binders. Tried smoking a bit and tasted like utter crap. 

Hey guys, so I know there's a few posts on here about making powdered BTH. essentially from what I gather, is you mix 2:1 tar to powder in a empty pill bottle with a nickel and shake and magically it turns into powder. I'm just curious from people who have tried it. 

From what I understand snorting has a higher bioavailability than smoking heroin(which is my current ROA), so this cheese should theortically should be stronger than smoking. I want to try this just for the novelty out of it, but also because money is getting tight and I figure I'd get more bang from my buck this way. Looking at the sidebar, smoking has a 35% bioavailability versus 44% with insufflating, so a 9% difference. So just curious to people that have done this, did you notice this cheese being stronger than just straight smoking black? Is there anyone here that exclusively does this over smoking? 

Also a kind of side question, I know some people use benadryl over baking powder for this. But any powder should theortically work right? I have some doxyalmine, which I figure I'd use since it's an antihistamine but also because I don't have any baking powder or benedryl and don't really wanna spend the few bucks on it lol.

About 3 years ago I was diagnosed with a nerve issue. Jumped through a million hoops and spent a ton of money on tests, dr. visits, etc. Found a legit PCP that was willing to subscribe me a decent dose of hydros. Nothing crazy, but enough to take care of the legit pain. After about 2 years the doc left the practice and I had to see a new doctor through the same office. Well the new doc is kind of a dick and has made it very clear that they dont want to prescribe me what I'm taking. Stating the only reason they continue to treat me is because I was already being treated by previous doc (basically grandfathered in). Well things changed with my insurance and I am now having to pay 100% of my health insurance (previously paid through work). The monthly payment is fuckin expensive.

I want to change insurance to save money on my monthly premiums, I dont trust my current doc wont try and stop prescribing me opiates, and lastly because my current doc has said that they do not prescribe anything stronger than what I have been on. I've gotten several comments that I should switch to pain management, but I wouldn't be able to do pill counts/ piss positive for my meds at the end of the month (because I use them all in the first week or two).

 Since changing docs could mean loosing my script, I wanted to get some feedback from  you beautiful peeps. I have 2 questions;

1. Is it possible to make an appointment with a new dr., let them know my situation, and ask if they would be able to continue my treatment if I make the switch? I want to find out before I switch, so if they won't do it I can continue to go to my regular doc. Not sure if that would be considered ""doctor shopping"".

2. Does anyone have any advice for finding a primary doc that isn't on the anti-opiates bandwagon? 

Thanks in advance for any advice.

TL/DR: Should I change docs and risk losing my script to save money on insurance and possibly get stronger meds?",1539781466.0

And to no one's surprise the rehab I'm in is 12 step based. I think there's value in these programs but I also have some gripes with them. 


YOU CAN SKIP THIS PARAGRAPH it's just about how I feel about the details of aa. I guess as I see some of the components of this program are meetings, calling your sponsor/other addicts, complete abstinence, working the steps, having a higher power, and being of service. I think the value of meetings comes from maybe just seeing that recovery is possible, being able to relate to people if you feel alone/isolated, simply filling up your time, and most importantly having a support group if you're thinking about relapsing or having a tough time. But 90 meetings in 90 days and multiple meetings a week does seem like a lot and idk if it's necessary. Calling people keeps you accountable and again gives you a support group, but again doing it every day seems like overkill and most of the time you end up talking about nothing. But then I hear it's about getting into the habit of 1) calling people so when you really do need to do it (like if might relapse) it'll be much easier and 2) doing things you don't want to do so you get better at not giving into impulses more generally. And idk about complete abstinence like if I smoke weed and drop acid or do nitrous would it really take me back to h? I'd say it depends on the person and asking for abstinence from everything is playing it safe just in case. The steps I see value in cuz you face the consequences of your actions, admit you can't go back to your doc, try to become more honest and accepting and less critical and stuff. The higher power thing I've sort of just used the group/the program because I'm definitely an atheist and a lot of the HP talk doesn't make sense or is contradictory. I think being of service is something that everybody should try to do regardless of whether it's in the context of AA or addiction. I feel like that's where fulfillment and purpose come from. 


So I guess the parts of the program I like are the community and support and meaningful relationships where people care about you, being more self aware and honest, and finding some sort of purpose or meaning (even tho I think the universe is inherently ""purposeless"" or whatever it wasn't made for humans or anything I think that meaning and purpose is self made and to some extent arbitrary). But as I said there's also some things I'm not a fan of. Have any of you been able to use the parts of aa you like without fully committing to everything and done fine, maybe supplementing your recovery with other things? I mean part of me acknowledges that if ii just did everything they asked and ""turned my will over"" I'd probably stay sober, but part of me is hesitant, which I should probably explore. If it's something as simple as I'm too lazy or anxious to call my sponsor every day I shouldn't let that stop me from staying sober if it's what I need. I know that some of that is just not wanting to become ""one of those"" AA people which is kinda stupid and embarrassing but it's there. I guess the argument is it's not much of a sacrifice to try the program out but the results of being sober are amazing (which I know they are). Maintenance is something I'd consider in the future but I'm gonna be on vivitrol for a couple months. Just looking for insights into how some of you guys managed to stay clean. Thanks!",1539760040.0

I am a daily user of H, administered via IV, using 4 points a day. Sometimes twice a day if I'm partying. 

Ive always wanted to try dilaudid due to the crazy rush everyone is always talking about, so I grabbed 4 of the 4mg white rounds for 50$, think I got a decent deal. Maybe I got ripped off, either way it happened.

I prepped two shots of 8mg each by crushing them down and cold mixing with 50 units of water, and filtered with a cotton. I did them back to back and didn't feel a dang thing. 

lesson learned: maybe try 16mg in one shot next time, or maybe 24mg.

Well, as it turns out, there was no problem at all. The people who worked at the clinic were very sweet and incredibly helpful, not to mention very understanding of my situation.

I erased my older reddit account that was full of drug related stuff and also started listening to different music, all of this to rewire my brain and make me think like a ""non-addict person"".

This plan lasted 3 days before i bought more dope and it even wasn't because of withdraws (i don't use enough to get into withdrawls) but because i missed the feeling.

Now, after 3 weeks i came up with a new plan: Yesterday my company paid me my salary and instantly i paid all of my bills and transferred all the remaining minus $50 to an investment i have that forbids me to withdraw money unless i'm willing to pay taxes and literally lose money. My company also pays for my public transportation and food with their cards so i literally had $50 to survive the next month and all this to make sure that i don't spend it on dope (because with only $50 i would need to manage my money very carefully).

Today i paid mine and 3 other friends our lunch with my company's food card and told them to pay me with money because ""i didn't had a lot in my wallet and didn't want to go to an ATM"". After getting out of work i went to the trap and copped with the money my friends gave me.

I've been an addict for about 9 years. The longest I've ever made it without using any opiate was 2 days.t

  


Startingast Monday (Oct 8th) I started using street subs. 8mg in the morning and 8mg before bed on the first day. Than from Oct 9th - 13th I used 2mg when needed, sometimes less, and used one 8mg sub. 14th I used .5mg in the morning.

  


  


If I decided to take some Oxy or H today or tomorrow will that put me back in withdrawal? If so, do I need to wait my normal 10-12 hours to take a sub? I just want to use once than not take a sub or anything. I am planning on using two weekends a month after I get off of daily dependence. 

  


  


Ever since I was a child life felt completely empty until I found opiates at 23. I went from a college dropout working at a detail shop getting drunk and having casual sex to getting married, getting my PhD, getting a dream job, and just feeling like a normal person.

What are the principle differences of chewing my Oxy vs swallowing it? I have a fairly low tolerance (maybe 60mg of Oxy on a strong day), so normally take a half of a blue at each sitting. Not really looking to nod out, just enjoy the chill, some minor eye rolling, etc.

Today, instead of just swallowing my half, I chewed it up a bit before I swallowed it. I was expecting it to probably hit a bit faster, but it also seemed noticeably stronger, which surprised me.

Was I imaging things, or does chewing it up increase the perceived strength? Additionally, I understand snorting greatly decreases the time it takes until you feel it, but also wears off sooner. Would the same principle apply here? ",1539668595.0

But when youre an addict as some of us are you dont have a care to give a shit about yourself. 
The only reason one can find to care about ones self is sinply because someone you care about cares about you. When you loose that person you loose everything. Relationships in addictions will always be flawed, because you have to care more about yourself to be able to relate and care for someone else. 

Not to say addicts cant care cuz some of the ones i know and have met are the most passionate and caring types. Almost why we become addicts is because life beats one down and is cold and favor you when you detach and dont care. 

Its hard to connect with others when we go thru this gauntlet and thats why i think we connect so much when we do.

Before that, I was sleeping great. 8-9 hours a night, was even able to stop taking my sleeping pills over a month ago (along with all my other mental health meds).

*Now* I'm sleeping probably worse than I can ever remember.  It's like I'm tired as fuck at night so I go to bed at like 10pm.  And then I wake up less than two hours later.  I try to go back to sleep but can't.  Most of the time I end up having to get up and watch a movie or something for *at least* two hours before I can go back to sleep for maybe another hour or two.

My fitbit tracks my sleep but hadn't been syncing for over a week.  It finally synced this morning.  The most sleep I've gotten according to that, including daytime naps, since I started suboxone is LESS THAN FIVE HOURS.  It's *AWFUL*.  

To keep my bipolar disorder and severe anxiety under control, I need 8-9 hours of sleep a night.  Since I started having the sleep issues, I started taking my sleep meds again but it's clearly not doing anything.  

My GP gave me tizanidine as a muscle relaxer and that makes me tired as hell but it's not actually helping me sleep.  Neither is the hydroxyzine I was given to replace the klonopin I was forced to stop taking a few months ago.  My shrink/suboxone prescriber said that I can no longer smoke weed (I've got a medical card) because of potential DEA audits. 

Is this sleep shit a normal thing? I'm taking the suboxone as soon as I *really* get up in the morning (sometime after 8 or 9am).  I'm trying to get off my ass and exercise every day.  I'm working.  But I'm a cashier and I'm so tired I can barely count out change.

I see my shrink tomorrow to follow up on my first week or so of suboxone and will obviously mention it to him but does anyone have sleep medication suggestions I can take to him? 

I'm so tired I barely even know what I'm talking about right now so sorry if I come off as a whiny bitch.  Thanks for any help any of y'all can give me.

I always tell myself that relapsing will ease the pain of whatever I'm going through at that moment- but over the last 2 years I've noticed that I'm always incredibly depressed and let down by my relapse- like not even fleeting happiness.

At some point in my addiction I remember the excitement and joy that would come with a relapse- I'd literally get butterflies (the happy type) on my way to copping. Now its just the knowledge that I'm about to go down a dark and painful road- and then on top of that I find that I'm not even enjoying the high.

Have any of you relapsed after a couple months or more and been happy about it? Like you forgot about what you were missing and were happy to have it again?

IDK I never want to go back to full blown everyday use and thats almost always where it fucking leads me to- but I always feel like something is missing and I've been dealing with a lot of emotional pain lately. I'm just curious as to if its a complete lie that this will make me feel better in any type of way.

I would take one 30mg in morning and in mid afternoon I‚Äôd take another 30mg and sometimes I‚Äôd buy a 30mg break it in half and take a 15 mg at night. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôve become this. I am an immigrant and came to United States from Somalia with my grandmother and older brother for a better life. I‚Äôve always been a decent student and person I‚Äôve never wronged anyone. I‚Äôm turning 24 in a few weeks. I should have completed college a few years ago but I found myself fucking around. But thankfully I am ready to quit and go cold turkey once again. I have tapered down my usage the past few weeks and I‚Äôm feeling relatively alright except for slight anxiety and poor sleep. But nonetheless I‚Äôve set my mind in putting this dirty and shameful habit behind me. My family don‚Äôt know of my situation and don‚Äôt seem thing I have any issues. I gave my agonies and miseries by myself. I always have. Never had a father or mother in my life. But that doesn‚Äôt concern me much I could give a rats ass about them. I blame myself for who I am because I know I am capable of so much more. I‚Äôve never used beyond some months . The last time I went cold turkey I was using much less than what I am using now. But that last time was hell for me and the biggest issue was that I had horrible insomnia and couldn‚Äôt get any sleep. It was fucking me up mentally too driving my anxiety through the roof. But eventually I started going to gym and keeping myself productive and after 3-4 weeks my sleep became better and anxiety became nonexistent. But since I‚Äôve been using much more now and getting ready to go cold turkey I am very fearful of the withdrawals especially with the insomnia and anxiety I hate them the worst. I know eventually they‚Äôll get better but just thinking about dealing with them gives me the creeps. I am ready to quit for sure. I used my last 30mg yesterday. Any suggestions on what I could expect and how long I‚Äôll be going through withdrawals. 60-75 msg is a lot I know but I‚Äôve read a few stories on here where loads of folks were using 200mg+ and have been able to quit and get there life on track. Talking about it very helpful I think this is my very first post on reddit about this issue. I‚Äôd gladly appreciate any helpful feedback on how to ease the withdrawals non medically but naturally and how I could stop myself from ever going back to this horrendous habit. Thank you for whoever reads this and helps me. God bless!,1539623484.0

If you have you've heard it a million times. *""Dude heroin is like the WORST drug you can do.""* Blah blah.. I always want to say actually its the best?! besides its not like I woke up one day and decided it'd be a good idea to try out some good ol' hurr-ron. BUT, I know there is at *least* one of you whose first opiate was hurr-ron. I'm going to need your autograph you fucking champ but really, what was it like? how much did you do? My first opiate was hydrocodone. *Blue Watson 10*. Yeah, I know you remember those bad boys. For some reason they always seemed stronger than any other tab huh? The crazy thing is the first time I tried it. I ate 3 of them. Total surprise, I was stoned and my buddy literally threw 3 of them in my mouth then went out to mountains. I remember feeling alriiiight, nothing special. I liked weed better. I didn't take any opiates nor care to until I was 18. At that point, I had been clean off drugs for a year. I had a real crazy reality check when I was 17 and went to jail for a night but that's a story. a helluva story. LOL (got a 2nd degree felony dropped to a disorderly conduct) I'll post later. I already had to retype this post because I'm an idiot.   
Anyways, yeah so my gf at the time gave me a blue 10, I took it with me to work but I waited until I got cut to take it because I didn't want to look fucked up in front of customers. ^((I was a server)) So I'm doing my side work then **BAM**. My whole life changed forever. ^(BTW she had tons of pills because her grandma had passed away and she was helping clean out her house and they had threw all the medicine in trash bag and tossed it. Well, she came back later and grabbed that trash bag out and the rest is history.) I literally felt like I was floating on the fluffiest cloud ever. I know you know the feeling. On top of that I was mackin' on big booty judy with my new found confidence I never knew I had. Remember the first time you felt that confidence?<3... That was 9 years ago. My DOC now is definitely morphine. I miss her so much. Her pins and needles in the most random spots. Her warmth rushing through my body. Sitting with a flushed face, a freshly lit full flavor newport, and of course my pepsi. Pure Bliss. If I feel like partying aka video games I gotta have a goofball.  
Sorry for rambling, like many of you I don't have anyone to talk to about my addiction/shenanigans but I kinda like it better this way. All you wonderful people. Whats your favorite adjective?

I've never used drugs. It was obvious to me something was up when we first met and she admitted she had a problem. 

It was long road.  But she is now clean.  She's been on subs for over six months and is doing great with sobriety. 

I'm struggling with some things I learned recently. 

When I met her, I found out that one way she was funding her addiction was through sex work. I accepted that about her. At a certain point in our relationship we both decided to become monogamous.  I had no reason to think she wasn't faithful to me until recently. 

I was selling her old phone and was going to wipe it. I found a texting app on it and that showed she was meeting guys for sex/money pretty much right up to the point she got clean. 

I confronted her about it and she confessed. 

I consider this cheating on me. She says she couldn't control it because she needed drugs. 

This is probably true. I don't know why someone would do that stuff for anything except money. I also feel very betrayed and lied to. 

I'm not really sure what to do about this. 

Why do addicts turn to things like this?

I know she feels horrible about herself. She hates that she did this stuff. She has other issues that maybe she needs to deal with too. 

It's just hard for me to let this go because I feel personally betrayed.

A bun maybe 2 a day. My last dose was at noon on Saturday so I woke up 6am in mild withdrawals. By 9am I said fuck it and dosed the suboxone. 3mg at a time until midnight and it got rid of all the withdrawal symptoms besides tossing and turning all night with absolutely no sleep.

I started browsing this subreddit after rehab because it was just interesting hearing about it all in there as 90% of the people I was with were for opiates.

I can wrap my head around ""getting well"" and how your tolerance gets so high that you don't even do it to get high any more, but feel normal.  I was drinking beer mainly over 20ish a day, and I couldn't even really drink it quick enough to get drunk.  I could get drunk if I drank liquor, but I really didn't like it and didn't want to get used to doing it, I suppose in a way similar going from smoking/snorting to iv in a way but obviously not exactly the same.

So towards the end before rehab I definitely didn't even feel normal unless I had a good 4 drinks.  I would shake and sweat like crazy and have panic attacks all the time.  The main reason I was afraid to quit myself though was because of how much I was drinking I was at risk for seizure or DT's and didn't want to die from withdrawals, but the actual acute withdrawal feeling wasn't the end of the world to me.  So my liver started to fail, went to hospital then right to rehab for a month and did actually end up having a seizure there.  

The opiate addicts there didn't really seem all that bad with withdrawals though, where as on here I read them as war stories.   I know they did sub taper them not much more than 2 weeks at most though if I recall correctly.  I'm just curious as to why when I read this subreddit lots of people stay using to just stay well or when they do get on subs they stay on them for years and not taper.  I'm also curious as to how you describe withdrawals, I think if I wasn't afraid of DT's or Seizures being very common with alcohol/benzo withdrawals I would have just stuck through it at home, so I'm guessing heroin must be a lot worse.

I reread this and don't intend it to be coming at anyone for still using I'm just to lazy to word it in a non blunt way, anyone can do as they please in my opinion.  Just as a lurker of this subreddit I'm just really curious.",1539581631.0

A few questions ...,"He had a spinal injury 1-2 years ago and was prescribed an insane amount of pills. When I met him he no longer had debilitating back pain, and was basically just giving half of them away and taking the other half at night because he just simply enjoyed taking them, and he told me that. He also told me he wanted to stop, so I encouraged him and helped him to stop filling his unnecessary prescriptions. 

Some time went by, once off the PKs he started to take benzos recreationally. At the time I viewed benzos as less dangerous, though I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs true anymore...He had a benzo withdrawal seizure but I also believe at the time he was still taking some of his fathers PK prescription- tramadol, and these may have both been at play there. Before I met him he apparently had 2 seizures from benzo withdrawals, both (at least the first) were prior to his back injury and painkiller prescriptions. 

He was honest with me about the benzos but initially refused honesty having anything to do with opioid use recently because I believe he did not want me to freak out and leave him after he promised he had stopped those.  So the week after quitting benzos after the seizure, I caught him nodding out last night (again), and after much arguing, he FINALLY admitted that he took a tramadol last night and has a ‚Äúfew other times my dad gave me some‚Äù.

How much does someone need to take to nod out? Just one tramadol? I‚Äôm pretty sure they are 100mg pills. I know he has connections for stronger painkillers and I had to resist going through his phone. He has nodded out on me with out with out drinking alcohol. From experienced users, what does it usually take to ‚Äúnod off‚Äù.. like 10+ times in one night before 12pm? Also, if he did only take 1 tramadol, could the addition of some benzo have caused him to nod too? 
One last question, for a skinny guy, how much tramadol or opioid does it take alone (with no benzo) to cause a seizure, if anyone knows?

I need to know for his safety, mainly because of his apparently higher sensitivity to seizures. Thank y‚Äôall so very much for reading. ",1539552253.0

It happened again, I sometimes run out early and have to deal with withdrawals cold turkey + kratom. Well I was depressed and used it as a coping mechanism. I know I fucked up, I am just trying to make this the least amount of pain possible until I can pickup a new script in 14 days.

They have been extremely supportive, especially considering I have no insurance at the moment (I was kicked off their plan because of my age). I am extremely fortunate, I know there are so many people in my boat who do not have the support system I currently have.  


So I'm going to my first NA meeting today, I'm a little nervous about it. But I know counseling and meetings can help so I'm going to try.  


Like many of you, I don't think I can do this without Suboxone. I have never come close to going to a clinic, and I'm going tomorrow for the first time (since it has been the weekend and today is Sunday). I have had a friend give me a couple subs to get me through the weekend without using H. I was worried that being on subs instead of H this might hurt my chances of getting Suboxone, but my friend tells me that if I'm honest with her doctor that it won't be a problem.

&#x200B;

But my parents are insistent that I go somewhere TOMORROW, and honestly I agree; it's for the best, the sooner I do this the less likely I am to go through these subs and go do something stupid. Wherever I go, though, I just want to know what the best way to ENSURE that I can actually get the script, as I don't know how hard they are to attain.  


I really want and need the 8mg strips, but the ones I've acquired off the street I have cut in halves to make them last through the full weekend. Should I be honest about this or should I just tell them I've been taking the full strips if I want to get 8mg strips?  


Also is there anything I should say or anything I should avoid saying to prevent them from holding off on giving me some subs?  


My friend did say that it will be okay that I have subs in my system and not H as long as I'm honest about it and why that is, is that really the case most clinics I would go to?  


Thank you guys for any help and advice  you can give me.

How I found H,"I want to share how I made the switch form oxycodone and hydrocodone to mexican black (which is all that was available in my area. I was using pills for a good two years almost daily and as you all know it gets expensive so I would run out and WD would kick in. Forutnatly I  was very lucky and never had a situation where I waited more than 24hrs before coming up on some pills. One Friday afternoon after scoring some 512's I decided to go to my barber since my hair was getting too long, one of my favorite places to get high was at my barbers, just sitting there in a lovely euphoric bliss while my hair was cut. While talking to my barber the topic of pills came up and I mentioned how I took pills from time to time, I was lying of course i did them every day. I asked him if he did ""anything"" and told me he did ""chiva"" which he told me was heroin. He showed me the brownish powder alongside some black rocks, I smelled it and for the first time got that vinegary smell we all know. I just thought to myself, ""I would never do that"". He offered some to me but I passed, and told me if I ever wanted to try some just to call him.

Fast forward 3 months later and I am out of money, my paycheck is 4 days away, and my plug wont front me anything. I had nothing left to pawn, no one would let me borrow money and I had already taken out loans from all the payday loan sharks in my area. ""Fuck it something will come up"", and I went to sleep that day, no WD yet. Upon waking up the next morning the restless legs began, my body started to ache, and racing thoughts began. By mid day I was about 36hrs since my last dose. The malia (term for the sickness in spainish) began to intensify and all I could think about was getting my hands on bottles full of pills, I imagined myself finding a large stash and getting well. By 3:24pm (I remember the exact time) I recalled the offer my barber had made. At that point I did not care, I called him frantically, told him I wanted to try some to see if it would get me well. Unfortunately he did not have any or money to buy some, ""fuck"" I thought, but he nonetheless asked me to go over to his shop, he said he could get some, I was unsure what he meant as he had no money and neither did I. When I arrived he had already called his plug and the waiting game began, good thing for me he arrived no less than 15min after I arrived. He asked me to walk with him, I saw a truck pull up and a mexican fellow greeted us. He intruduced me to him as a new customer, and my barber said that I wanted to try some of this product. So we ended up getting a free half gram. Plug thought he was going there sell a gram, my barber never told him he had no money XD the plug was not happy but later on he admitted he was ok with it since I became a good customer.

Moving on, I knew I did not want to go the IV route, so my barber dissolved 10cc in a syringe and I put it down my nose, at this point the sickness was at its peak. I let 5cc go and OOOWEEEEEE did it burn!!!! ""fuck it here goes the other 5cc, AHHHHHHRGHHH!!!""... minutes later a wave of calmness swept over my entire body as the sickness was eradicated and I just sat in the barber chair thankful for this moment, but I soon realized I had done heroin for the first time, something I vowed not to do..... I vowed never to use the needle... two month later............

&#x200B;

But, with opiates the chioces seem much more slim, particularly in the U.S. in the wake of all the opioid hysteria. Like, you can either get absurdly overpriced pills that aren't going to get you very far, and if you don't like that? Well you can jump straight to Lady Heroin which may be laced and kill you on the very first dose. 

&#x200B;

Plus, I guess I'm a little bitch about it too, like I have to take everything orally or sublingually. My sinuses and respitory system in general is very delicate so no snorting or smoking/vaping anything. No mainlining because, welp, I just don't want to go that road. Putting it up the other end? well I mean I'm not entirely opposed but mixing together and administering an enima sounds like a real hassle, lol.

&#x200B;

I guess I missed out on all the relatively cheap oxy from the mid 2000s-mid 2010s I guess, oh well. I looked into stuff like Morphine or Methadone? Idk how I'll respond to that. May try Ketamine as well just to see how I respond to it. 

&#x200B;

I mainly want to keep painkillers around just in case I develope chronic pain or have an emergency, since they don't get my particularly high in comparison to other drugs like Shrooms, Ambien, and MDMA, which are my favorites. I may want to just try and stockpile what I can before the nanny state inacts martial law to stop all opiate prescriptions so they can look big and tough -\_- or maybe just grow my own poppies and make some laudenum like some old timey alchemist, lol.",1539474321.0

And if you need me, remember I‚Äôm easily found, I live all around you, in schools and in town.
I live with the rich, I live with the poor, I live down the street, and maybe next door.

You‚Äôll lie to your mother; you‚Äôll steal from your dad, when you see their tears, you feel sad.

But you‚Äôll forget your morals and how you were raised, I‚Äôll be your conscious, I‚Äôll teach you my ways.
I take kids from parents, and parents from kids, I turn people from God, and separate friends.
I‚Äôll take everything from you, your looks and your pride, I‚Äôll be with you always, right by your side.
You‚Äôll give up everything‚Ä¶your family, your home, your friends, your money, then you‚Äôll be alone.
I‚Äôll take and take, until you‚Äôll have nothing more to give. When I‚Äôm finished up with you, you‚Äôll be lucky to live.

If you try me, be warned, this is no game. If given the chance, I‚Äôll drive you insane.
I‚Äôll ravish your body; I‚Äôll control your mind. I‚Äôll own you completely; your soul will be mine.
The nightmares I‚Äôll give you while lying in bed, the voices you hear from inside of your head.
The sweats, the shakes, the visions you‚Äôll see; I want you to know, these are all gifts from me.

Why do so many photos and posts have benzos being combined with your opiates? 

Most literature (media, anecdotal, and medical - I work in healthcare) states that the combination of benzodiazepines and opiates is quite dangerous and greatly increases the risk of overdose. Is this an overstated risk? Is the combination just too good to resist? I would love to know more.

Nobody see that, its because I am in Brazil and we dont know how to deal with opiate addiction, I had a almost overdose (stayed fucked up and leaved to the hospital by the family - everybody just new you are addicted to cigarettes, weed, coke, crack, and everykind of a pill (morphine, dones, xan, valiums, kpins, phenorbital, somas, oxys, promethazine, dividol, really everything), including my opiate IV morphine addiction.

I go:
8am: 1mg kpins, 75mg ER lyrica, 20mg lexapro, 20mg dones
3pm: 2mg kpins, 20mg dones
11pm: 1mg kpins, 75 ER lyrica, 20mg dones, 300mg XR seroquel

I overdosed on I think 800mg of morphine IV along the day, 3000mg of somas along the day, 100mg of diazes, 8mg of rophys, snorted coke all day, with some crack pipe rounds. 

Black out, wake up 2pm with my unclke pushing in my bed to the hospital, telling him not to go, just to leave my there sleeping, I would get up sometime, telling it every second and forcing to my bed, he had more force, I was resisting going, but my family puts me on the car and take me there, blacked out. 

Woke up same day, 6am, sober, my family new everything, in my bag was everything, I was with many trackmarks, fuck.

My psychiatrist was on vacation, they dont give my any medication, just leave my under supervisation, my bpms were 35-40 sometime during this time, and my pression got down too, but wake up with my doc telling my it was a miracle, so, I was glad I was alive, but down there treatment.

 I was on 600-700mg day IV, started on 30mg oral every 6h hours, second day 20mg/6h, third day 10mg/6h - it stayed 3 days, then 10mg morph/8hr, with 10mg of dones on the night, then 10mg dones on the morning, then they put morph 12hrs 10mg, and 10mg of dones in the evening, so 30 daily, then just one dose of morph, after nothing, but 20mg of dones in the night, and then stabilized with 20mg/8hrs. All this with 2mg kpins/6hrs, to help like if it this help something, and that. Yes it was hell, more than hell, hell x 1000, I was begging them to just drop up the morph, I tried not to take, family discovered, and forced medics to see if I take it, so I am on 60mg dones.

Still feeling some discomfort, some early wds symptoms everytimes, restless legs, muschles aches, stomach discomfort, sweats, and some more symptoms, still hopes that my next psych up my dose of dones and put my on a manutention, even with all my family thinks contrary, and thinks I need a detox.

I heated up my rig and waited for it to cool a bit took most of it in within 1 hit and exhaled within seconds I knew I fucked up I ended up getting so fucked out of my skull last night I was passing out  and I think I almost oded as I was smoking pure heroin out of the rig.

Now I like it a lot I enjoy the nod very euphoric but I tend to get really nauseous and so I find that unless I'm constantly taking benedryl while on heroin I get sick. 

Now I've heard/read that other options such as oxy vicodin codeine can be less hard on the nausea. BUT from what I see/hear they are ridiculously expensive!!! A $1 a mg? Mother of God! I pay about $90 a .5 for H and its some of the best stuff you can get.

But last night, I splurged and bout half a G to get me through the weekend. Since I had more than usual, I decided that instead of getting not sick, I would try and get a little nod, and took .2 grams at once. Next thing I know, I'm getting narcaned on the bathroom floor with two paramedics and about nine cops in the room. 

So, I assumed, the paramedics assumed, everyone assumed I just took too much. Stupid, I know, but here we are. The cops took my stuff, so I hit up my guy today. 

I just took .1 grams, like usual, but I still just got awoken off of the bathroom floor. Not narcaned this time, my roommate managed to slap me out of it. 

Like I said, at this point, .1 grams is not getting me high, it's keeping me from not getting sick. I've got a high tolerance. So the fact that my usual dose is knocking my dick in the dirt is concerning enough for me to share my story and let you guys know that there is something the the NE Georgia region that is possibly quite dangerous. So I want y'all to be safe. 

To give you an idea of the range without getting too specific, the town's involved are Commerce, Dacula, and Laconia. I won't say which is which, but one town is where the dealer is based, one is where I purchased it, and one is where his source is. I don't want you guys going out looking for it, so I won't say which is which. But it should give you an idea of how far dope travels and why I'm saying the entire NE Georgia region. 

Mods, if I put too much info on the location, I'll edit the post. 

Please be careful you guys. I almost died last night, and I almost really hurt myself tonight. This lifestyle is dangerous, so be as safe as you can be. Test your stuff. Don't take too much. Make sure that somebody is around who can possibly save your life. ",1539389622.0

After going four months sober for my first time, I relapsed around two months ago after my girlfriend left to train in another city. I started right back up with H and became dependent immediately. Very little IV use my first go around, but I began using the point a lot more frequently this time around. Though I stopped IV use a week before my girlfriend returned (only reason was to hide tracks), my tolerance had skyrocketed. Forward to two weeks ago, I decided to rob a good friend of mine for her Nintendo switch (tho I already had one) and other small possessions. I've never really stolen from anyone before (other than $20s out of my moms purse). My friend then proceeds to call me assuming that I had stolen it bc she knew I was one of very few people who could access her house. I denied the allegations religiously, and EVEN HELPED HER FILE A POLICE REPORT (yes. I practically called the cops on myself) long story short the device was tracked back to me, called my lawyer and told him what had happened, and he just arranged for me to turn myself in either this evening or Monday morning (I know the police don't sleep on the weekend but the city I live in, they are very incompetent and I can lay low enough).

I'll try to keep it short and sweet. I just want some opinions on the matter

So my girlfriend is an ex heroin user. Like, it was bad. The kind of bad where she tells me stories about that time in her life and I can't help but cringe first and then cry. Her recovery was a struggle, but she made it through it and got clean. That was about the time I met her.

Fast forward to almost a year into our relationship. She started going through this horrible pain. She would lay in bed at night and cry. Cry and cry and cry. We would go to the emergency room. We went to doctors. They talked about cluster headaches. She couldn't find the answers she wanted. She tried doctors, chiropractors. She got MRI's of her head and back. Some recommended it was her cervical spine due to past traumas. She even had her sinuses operated on for a deviated septum. Nothing worked. Suddenly she found a home in the chronic pain community, and started looking into fibromyalgia. This started her to start saying that's what she has. Doctors have tried to give her many medications, but she always refused anything that was an opiate. Nothing worked and she would still cry about her pain, and say things like, ""I wish I could just feel normal"" and other things like you hear everyone in the chronic pain community. We live together and I have watched her cry and cry and cry and beg for her life to be normal. I believe it. But  suddenly she begins taking tramadol. It's her only escape from the pain. I was weary of it (for obvious reasons), but I don't want her to deal with this pain all of the time. I try to ask her to be open about it, but she never tells me about her taking it
I love this woman to death and I don't want to see her fall into an opiate addiction. One of the main reasons I fell in love with her was her strength.

So after a few squabbles asking her about the tramadol, she agrees to let me hold onto them and control them and just give her one whenever the pain is too much.

Enter this semester of college. She asks for the bottle. The reasoning is is that she doesn't want to be at school and suddenly have a terrible pain day. I think to myself, you know what? She's right. It could be bad
 I don't want her to have to deal with pain so horribly. Time passes and she never talks about it. I have trouble asking her about this, and because of her past this is a  sensitive subject for her. She gets very offended and brings up how everyone ever (family, doctors, me) see her as an addict. How she will never get out of this pain, and how she needs this to feel normal. I feel terrible. I cry and apologize. She's used up the remainder of her script  (which was fast compared to when I controlled it) but I reason that her walking campus all day is rough with her illness.

Today I find an empty script she had filled the 20th of last month in our medicine cabinet. 50mg tramadol twice a day is what the instructions say. She's never once told me directly she had it filled (which I asked her to be open about). She will say ""her medicine"" but she has several prescriptions, and the tramadol is the only I know for certain that is a opiate. SO I ask her about it. She got very defensive and pulled the same ""I need this to feel normal, I'll never feel normal again, I wish I had never told you about my past, all the same anger she gets anytime I ask her about it.... I don't know anything about opiates.... And I may just be freaking out... can anyone PLEASE give me some light on the stuff? Maybe some experiences? Some signs I should watch for?",1539334956.0

What I‚Äôm curious to know, is do the effects of buprenorphine last longer if the pills are taken like they are supposed to be ‚Äî under the tongue ‚Äî or do the effects last longer if aborted? I have seen a lot of conflicting information. Some people say taking them as directed is much better, and a lot of people swear by snorting them, saying the effects ‚Äúhit you instantly‚Äù and last ‚Äúmuch longer‚Äù making the pills last longer if used this way.

Does anyone know for sure?",1539364180.0

Why is it that opiates or synthetic ones cause this annoying  itching, what is it that makes your body release the histamine's? What's in the chemical that does this? Is there a reason for it etc etc?
Second question, what is it with opiates that stops you from pissing, I know that this happens to others, some get it worse than others, it's the same with itching, it's so Fuckin anoying if your at a public toilet and your stood at the urinal for ages, even though your bursting to piss, and eventually you give up for fear of being branded a cock watcher, what causes this water retention, the only thing I can think of is the body is numbed so much it fails to register when you need a piss, I don't know.
Sorry i know were all not Professor's on here mainly humble users of this shit, but if any one can shine any light on these questions mainly the two things that ruin the pleasurable feelings off these drugs.

After discovering the lovely opana, I've been railing probably 40-50mgs per day. It's expensive and I can't keep doing this, not only that but waking up in withdrawal, it's not fun. This morning I woke up major restless legs, almost 24 hours after my last dose, (oxymorphone withdrawals are fucking brutal) took a bunch of kratom and gabapentin, it hardly did anything. Instead of taking more to try and relieve the symptoms, I got a hold of my plug, got more opana, and railed that right away. 


I do have chronic pain, but I'm an addict too. I feel like I can't quit on my own, the pain gets too intense. I'm considering going on MMT, I called the nearest clinic and I'm waiting on a call back. I'm not sure if methadone or suboxone would better for me, but I do think it would be a good idea for me to get on one or the other. I just feel like I'm at the end of my rope here. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, love you guys. ",1539355353.0
