I started shooting myself two weeks ago. I have east coast powder available to me. Now I'll take you step by step to see why I don't get half the high I get snorting.

I empty the amount I want in the spoon. Always use a new clean needle and fill maybe 30-40cc with water. I squirt the water onto the dope. I take cotton from a Q-tip and drop it in. I then insert the needle in the middle of the cotton and pull till dry. I take syringe for air bubbles and take them out of the equation.

I have small and shallow veins. Even doctors have always bitched about it. I use a belt without loops, it just kind of goes through two metal hoops and tightens, probably not the best but I can't find a proper turiqute(sp?)

Anyway, I have to find the best vein available and after two weeks I look like a pincushion. 9 failed punctures for each ""success"" and I have a lot of bruising. I'm using 1cc 30g short needle insulin needles from a pharmacy btw.

After a while, I finally find one where I pull back the plunger and dark red blood comes into the syringe. I thought that means the deals done. I'm sure I've wiggled some at some point and ruined this perfect hit. A friend said something about breaking the vein? I don't know if she meant going through the other side of the vein. I do notice sometimes I'll get 10-15cc of dark blood then air come into the syringe. What does this mean?

I'm sure I missed something but it's late and I'll make any additions in an edit tomorrow. I just see all these people look like they hit heaven the instant they shoot and I wait 5 minutes to feel ""decent"". The dope isn't anything to win a contest but if I can get high just fine snorting then I'm doing something wrong.

Any suggestions would be helpful.",1490087230.0

A few days ago a friend and I met up to go cop from my usual plug who typically has some fire shit. So we're in the bathroom at this apartment complex and I fix his shot for him and hit him since he'd never really don't it himself before. I give him a small dose because I know he's not used to slamming and I don't wanna kill him. He seems perfectly fine and to top that off he's barred out. So I'm thinking it's all good and I cook up my shit and do the whole shot at once (big mistake). I got the most amazing rush I'd ever had and put my hands down on the counter and looked at him and said ""woah this is some strong shit"". He laughed and told me to be careful cause it looked like I was going to fall over and maybe I should sit down. I think he said some other stuff but at that point it all sounded really far away. That's the last thing I remember before I woke up to like 6 paramedics over my, a tube down in my nose and down my throat and an iv in my arm. Apparently about a minute after I took my shot I fell over and my lips started to turn blue, causing my poor friend to panic and call 911 (he's so sweet), and drag me out of the bathroom and as close to the sidewalk as he could get me so the ambulance could get to me faster. They gave me 4 doses of narcan, had me connected to a machine to breathe for me and were doing chest compressions until I woke up. As soon as I opened my eyes I popped up and immediately began vomiting so violently it was actually painful. I can't describe how fuckin bad that narcan hurt. On my way to the hospital in the ambulance the nice paramedic girl told me that if they had gotten there only 30 seconds later I would've been dead and there would've been nothing they could do for me. I spent the next 5 hours at the hospital with an oxygen tube, adrenaline and my crying parents. I later found out that the tar I had was likely laced with fentanyl and I probably hit a hotspot in the bag we had. Only upside was the shot of Valium they gave me right before I left. The entire experience was terrifying for everyone involved and now I'm in the process of trying to stay clean once again. Fuuuuck me. 

Tl;dr - overdosed after doing a shot that was the amount I normally do, paramedics used 4 doses of narcan and still barely brought me back, had they gotten there 30 seconds later I wouldve been dead. 

GOD BLESS my friend who actually called 911 instead of bailing like some people would have. ",1490076065.0

It's all the same advice that I received the 15+ times I tried to quit. 
This is ultimately a slow track journey to your personal rock bottom and once you're there it's dependent on your current state of mind as to whether you just completely break loose and reside within it or whether it's your turning point. I guess this is down to a combination of personality type and current situation/surroundings.

All the times I failed to quit there was a theme that I'd be sober for X amount of days but I'd be actively counting them and I'd be craving on a psychological level - not just craving an escape from the shit physical WDs. When I finally cracked it and stayed sober was the time where I'd downright loathe the thought of opiates for the complete havoc they caused on my day to day life and the complete waste of time that they are. (Yeah, strong opinion to express on an opiate board but unfortunately years of ruin brought me to this conclusion. I feel nothing negative towards anybody that uses and I have no interest in judging others. This is how I feel if I consider myself taking opiates. You do you.)

It seems to me that one of the most important things for successfully quitting opiates is being of the opinion that you hate the lifestyle you've created and not that you hate yourself for where you are. We all know what happens when you find yourself hating yourself, withdrawing from opiates and having access to them. Sure, it's not a universal formula, in fact I may be one of the minority where this is the case but hey, I'm just trying to share my thoughts from my experience. For me, the self-hatred followed and it's still something I'm dealing with - I still can't forgive myself. 

So what do I think are the important points to note?

- If you try to quit and you fail, do not beat yourself up over it, but also at the same time do not take it as a reason to feel too good (Oh I quit for 7 days I'm doing good, a few days won't hurt now) etc. The fact you've tried to quit and you've gotten somewhere shows that you're trying to face the battle that lies ahead. It takes time.

- Once you are past physical withdrawal and are left with PAWs, when you are feeling low please talk to somebody understanding about what is on your mind. This is important and I do not just mean when you're craving, I mean when you're depressed/anxious and such, because as opiate addicts we very often use opiates as a way to escape these problems and learning that there are other ways is a very helpful tool.

- Actions speak louder than words. You can say you're going to stay clean this time and you won't relapse, you can truly believe that and then have it fall through. Reserve telling yourself and others this - tell yourself that you're doing all you can at the current time to stay clean. A negative effect that I experienced/still have troubles with is all the times I said I'd get clean to somebody and then fell through on it, I felt that I completely nullified any validity of my statements - ""Yeah, but this isn't like last time, I'm going to really change"" loses its effect after it's been said more than twice. Be optimistic but realistic. You can't fail to try your best, but you can fail to do.

- Take things that will ease your withdrawals but not things that will completely remove them. WDing with a ton of benzos and more can certainly help some, but for others it can definitely reduce the perceived intensity of your problem. When I finally got clean I treated it very much like an introspective acid trip - I made this bed and now I must lay in it. When I was at the point of owning up to the shit storm I had summoned, I embraced the horrid situation for all it was and took it as a very sadistic lesson for myself. LOPERAMIDE and MAGNESIUM, I'd always brushed these off as probably not helping that much but when I'd gotten clean for a week or two in the past I'd have those days of running to the bathroom 50x in a day at the peak, with loperamide, taking ~20mg/day and decreasing by 2mg a day I didn't experience this issue at all, which is one of the worse sides of physical WD. Magnesium and hot baths are great for RLS and shivers/aches.

- You've got to replace that huge amount of spare time you invested in getting high in something else. For myself, once I'd gotten past 3 weeks of quitting I started cycling like crazy. I'd cycle 2-3 hours every day regardless of the weather and I'd set myself goals for distances/speeds I'd want to hit. It hurt, it exhausted me, but it was all a big mental battle - teaching myself determination and proving to myself that I can follow through with things. If I can quit opiates then surely I can do this menial physical task, right? Building up that determination and belief in yourself is key. Endorphin's and exhaustion from exercise are also great help when you're dealing with the strange new state of being comprehensive and conscious the whole day.

- There were many things I disliked about myself and my lifestyle due to opiate addiction. Use all this new found free time to fulfil any desires you may have. For me this was losing weight, reading and getting over the anxiety I had surrounding sharing music I'd recorded. For me opiate addiction started because I hated my life and whilst my life did change for the better in ways during my habit, there is always more to strive for.

- No, you won't just use again this once. If you're thinking this then I'm afraid you're probably not at the point of seriously wanting to quit. WDs will come on so much faster and stronger having had a habit in the past - I'd quit for 2 weeks and believe that I could use once or twice, then after using 3 days in a row my WDs were reset and I'd gone through 2 weeks of hell for nothing. 

I doubt that everything I've said here is relevant to everyone, but I hope that someone finds something in here that helps them. This is just my experience and my opinions and everybody's situation is different, I was using opiates as a last resort having failed suicide and having those thoughts creeping back. I had clearly very much upset those close to me when I failed to OD and the support and love they showed me made it too hard to justify doing it again when the desire came back, so I began using as a means of trying to work things out. I'm closer to happiness now than I was when I began using, but it has not been an easy ride and I am 100% certain that there would have been better ways to tackle this problem. 

My battle now is not quitting opiates or avoiding cravings, but forgiving myself for what I have done and the hurt I caused during this addiction. Again I say, actions speak louder than words. Every day I wake up and I do all I can to progress and show change makes a difference. It is not easy, but it gets easier every day.

My last words? Opiate addiction is like taking out a loan on happiness and the interest is huge. I truly hope all of you can find what you're after if you haven't found it yet. I have love for all of you guys, I hope that the next day is easier than the last.

>Back in the day my hustle was busting through passwords on laptops (someone has a stolen laptop that is password protected brings it to me and for a point I'd crack the pw and wipe the drive).
Disturbingly often I would find kiddieporn on the drive. When confronted with that I would just pull the drive and slip it into the local PD's night drop slot with a post-it on what they can expect to find.
After doing this for a bit, I was all the sudden labeled as a snitch due to this police interaction. Seems the thought process was that there was NO acceptable reason for ever talking to (or ""helping"") the cops regardless the motivation.
Personally, I call bullshit on this viewpoint, but a frighteningly large amount of the local druggie population looked at things in this manner.
I'd like to hear all y'all's opinion. Do you think it is acceptable to ""rat"" on kiddy diddlers or are you of the stance that one should never cooperate with law enforcement regardless the crime?

I've been a daily user of oxycodone for about a year now, around 90mg a day habit (let my tolerance go up lately by mistake), with no issue doing 120mg-150mg to catch a better high, 90mg is more so baseline but I still feel fairly powerful effects. I always preload with White Grapefruit Juice I get at Kroger plus Tums & benedryl (& zytrec I take daily for my actual allergies). 

For the first time ever, I was provided with E8 oxycodone pills (I've had always had a rotation of: A-215, V48 12, M Box, & A-51) on Friday. I did around 105mg each day (Fri, Sat, Sun) with me running out on Sunday and that being the first time I took a few E8 pills orally (2.5 E8s & 1 V48 12). 2 Hours after taking I got really bad sweats from my forehead which never happens, and started sweating all over for hours. I also had some hot/cold flashes as well which continued through the night. I consumed 2 beers later that evening & went to bed. 

I was roughly woken up at ~5:40a to feeling extreme hot / cold, sweating, and completely unable to fall back asleep. I had slight restless legs that seemed almost like Withdrawal, but it had only been since 1p that day when I dosed (just 16 hours earlier) which didn't add up with WDs but 100% felt like it. Eventually got well around 4p today with more E8s (only option), took them, and AGAIN am feeling the sweats and slightly hot/cold after taking 105mg (90mg oral / 15mg intranasal). [Here's what they look like](http://imgur.com/a/np7bx)

This is really strange as I've never experienced anything like this before. Does anyone have any insight into this? Also, my pills are confirmed legit, script never anything else and have never been wronged.  Thanks

tl;dr Regular does of E8 pills is making me sweat a lot, have hot/cold flahes, and woke up in what basically was WD's not just 16 hours after my oral dose (NEVER has happened before, ever). [Picture of the E8 Pills](http://imgur.com/a/np7bx)",1490051997.0

I had been taking nucynta from him for about 9 months. Never took any other opi or anything. Passed all urine.

Friend from HS had a bachelor party and did some stuff. Asked my friend that happens to be a girl, to pee for me. At my doc office they don't label the urine sample jars and there's often a few other samples by the end of the day all on the same shelf. 

Urine came back from lab with oxy in it. Also, none of the meds I'm suppose to be taking. My friend is an asshole and told me she didnt take anything in about a month. 

Anyway, they booted me. My question is should I ask them to test it and say it must be a mistake? I know she was on birth control and heard that can be tested for. So, should I just bite the bullet and find another doctor and pray they prescribe now? Or should I try to do something to bring up reasonable doubt and that the lab, or doc office might have screwed up the test? 

My only concern, if I go down the latter route, is that they don't care if the pee isn't mine either. Then they just say that I tried to switch urine on them. The whole process was dumb and lazy it seemed. I constantly thought to myself, what if they mixed up mine with those other unlabeled samples?

And that's how I started and now I'm a fucking mess who steals piss from toilets, shits themselves at the bus stop after a bad morphine plugging incident, and puts their tit and manky drug paraphernalia on this sub.

So no 13th stepping, unless I get the rehab equivalent of a prison wife; which I'm not particularly interested in with all the love and respect to the gays. But I'm just a bit apprehensive about what the expectation vs reality is in rehab. So I'm just asking if anyone's experienced with this kinda shit and can offer any good tips, advice, stories, what to expect etc, I'd really appreciate it.

Also I won't have access to a phone or any internet, so it's goodbye for a while /r/opiates. I might be back after rehab, I don't know.

I apologize, because this isn't opiate related, but there are more IV users here than r/stims. Please no lectures.

I bang meth occasionally, and I've had no issues in the past. New needle each time, alcohol swabs, rotating veins. Anyway, tonight I tied up my forearm to hit my cephalic vein an inch or so up from my wrist on my thumb side. I am a very skinny female around 100lbs, so my veins are very little. I used a tourniquet of a shoe lace in a slip knot and held it with my teeth. Once registering, I let go of the shoe lace, but it did not completely loosen. I'm unable to let go of the needle to release a proper tourniquet. My shot was maybe 20 units of a U 100 insulin needle. Since the tourniquet wouldn't release completely, I pushed very slowly. I didn't even do the entire shot, because my skin/vein started bulging. I immediately pulled the needle out and untied completely. I got a warm compress on it right away. It's not very red, but it does look like it's going to be a pretty gnarly bruise. It also is not very painful if I poke it, but more so feels very irritated. This happened about two hours ago. 

I am not freaking out, but obviously I'm concerned. It's not hard from being swollen, it's not very red, and it's not hot to the touch. Did I just burst the vein because I fucked up with the tourniquet? Should I continue with warm compresses? Anything else I should be doing to help this heal? Likelihood of this being really bad??",1490174771.0

Completely sober for two years, about to graduate with an associates in Software that I can land a job with and work while going for my Bachelor's.  Life is good and that's what I'm afraid of.

I don't even feel in control in any sense of the word when I use and it would hurt soooooo bad to see it go.

It's like... I can just feel 'it' creeping in sometimes.  This jagged, crazy mental state that I associate with addiction.  I'm not sure if it's what drove me to addiction (it's unpleasant) or if it's a result of being addicted, but it's like something is gnawing on my brain, a jagged, dysphoric sensation that is just screaming at me to go use and kill it for a few hours.  I just feel myself so close to succumbing to it and slipping back in.  Maybe I'm just crazy but it winds me up and I can't stand it sometimes.  I feel like a caged animal.

I'm also on daily sub anyway so my hard opiate using days are gone, but it's also nice because despite my huge tolerance the sub definitely acts as a kind of Speedball Jr. or something. I mean usually it's barely noticeable, but tonight I tried crushing up like 0.5 - 1mg of Subutex and mixing it with a fat line, and it was really, really fucking nice actually. It was also great because I currently have the kind of subutex that crushes up into fine powder super easily (unlike the other brands I've tried); it's an orange-pink kinda color exactly like the old school Suboxone tablets, and it feels exactly the same when crushed and snorted so it might be made from the same binders/fillers or whatever.

Anyway, good coke is just something else. It's definitely energetic but it's also pretty relaxing in a way, you don't have to be bouncing off the walls or whatever. It's just pure, calm euphoria. And so mixing judiciously with an opiate makes it even better. Having a beer or two before a line also feels amazing, but it's fairly dangerous/toxic (much more than either substance by itself) so I try to avoid it or only have a beer or two, just a small amount of alcohol, if I do combine.

I've got some really nice fishscale-like stuff currently -- it has a definite shine to it, but nothing wild, what really makes it stand out is how flaky and sticky/clumpy it is, how hard it is to crush into any kind of fine powder. I have to hotplate it to get anything snortable, as sniffing without totally crushing first really fucks up the nose. But this stuff must be the best I've had. It feels super clean and I'm sure whatever it might be cut with isn't active or especially dangerous (I hope so, anyway, but sadly I know how pervasive that evil levamisole is). Just beautiful stuff. And like all good white it lasts for a pretty good while, not just a quick 15-30 minute thing or whatever.

There are downsides, of course. It's pretty impossible to get to sleep within 3-4 hours of doing blow, and I don't like the all-night binge kinda thing, especially when it goes into multiple days. If used in moderation (which is hard admittedly), though, it can be really great. It's just so addictive, the urge to have ""more"" is so strong, but you must fight it if you wanna have any left in the morning...

Who else here loves some white with their opiate of choice? It's like peanut butter and chocolate, you can't go wrong with this kind of combo. (Except I must add that it's technically not very good for you to combine an upper and a downer, so be careful with speedballs, etc etc.)",1490169915.0

We have along the years been programmed to believe psychedelics are secretly good and prescription drugs are acceptably good. Inside the acceptable was the loving opiate like a warm embrace in a Mother's womb. Outside the psychedelics, or more specifically the fringes of a psychedelic experience was the cold and repelling, like space.

I grew up with a regular childhood, had friends here and there, indeed felt abuse verbally by bullying from like assholes and my older sister, I believe we all have to be rounded in this way for some reason, whilst being aware bullying is wrong (and an epidemic). Rights of passage? Lol. Had awesome cousins to model being a good person from. My parents are shitheads. 

Yadda-yadda- Smoked weed at 14, cigs at 15, didn't touch anything until I was 17-18. Adderal in high school, sophmore to senior year. Tried a single xanax at 17. Snorted 8mgs of dilaudid at 18.

Dilaudid did it for me. That feeling stayed in the back of my head for a long while and I didn't expect to miss it. I pushed it away. I didn't at all have an interest in opiates or prescription drugs any more. I wanted more. I tried LSD at 18 and through the pain and revelation of that suffering being that it will grow you to Love in a certain way (sacrifice to be a genuinely good person). Pessimists can think that is narcissistic and I would agree because I relate to them. I am an optimist, though, and this proves my narcissism because... I am insecure. As fuck. I skipped just about everything and went to heroin. After a supposedly ""enlightening"" substance. Lol.  Are you familiar with the Smile Train charity shit thing? I was born with a cleft palatte and (although I see past that at times & admit I'm sexy as fuck) being that person who had to answer the question ""Why do you look like that"" took a mental but most importantly an emotional affect on me. I'm an emotional hot mess filled with cold turd. 

Yet, I still found it in me to live and love and appreciate. I've had a suicidal thought or few however I've never intentionally tried to kill myself. Always just wanted to get high. Higher. Push my limit? Break the glass ceiling. Look at my inferior self and dissect it and know it and *fuck its daughter*.

(NOT MY DAUGHTER I DON'T HAVE ONE I sincerely just mean to OWN my insecurities & somehow make others recognize my efforts & help perceive me in the ways I need to react to life & its interactions to step into being a new person)

I can't grasp my personality? I'm not sure how I am expressing myself and projecting myself to people. I want every body to see me the way I recognize myself. As objectively as possible.

If *any* of that makes sense. Another insecure yet semi-intelligent narcissist... aren't we all like is there really no difference or anything remotely unique about us?

And thus pangs of creative philospohical existentialism shrouded in the mist of calculating rigid logic haunt my reality through these actions and rituals I never *really* decided to become apart of. Quite daunting isn't it to attempt to express the subjective self perception blanketed in white canvas never touched (except by Dad...ow) by a real corruption disrupting the monotone, neutral Ego you've never wanted to know to begin with? 

I didn't mean to ask that.

If I had to say anything it's that drinking a highly hallucinogenic & spiritually revered beverage (or two) twice for two nights, 8 hours each, for *free* will not, won't, super ain't gonna make you stop using until you REALLY don't want to look at yourself any longer. I've played the games down in the rabbit hole with intention of love and light and servitude and it's broken me down to putting dope in my arm. The scales don't weigh out to me. 

*Trying to justify, justify, justify, observe, observe.*

I don't know if I'm good or bad. A week with no opiate whatsoever, now

I'm probably a scumbag but I give you this shitpost to *hopefully* be critiqued or criticised or supported or give you a thought to think. I dunno but thank you bliss up y'all, be good, happy nodz.

The walls feel like they’re closing in on me. My mortality becoming a bright, blinking neon sign. At 27, I feel too old to change and too young to resign myself to death. I keep putting off getting clean. Tomorrow when I wake up, tomorrow, tomorrow…

There has been thousands of tomorrows. In that time I lost 21 pounds. I lost the love of my life (although if and when I become clean, I will be able to see clearly, and I’ll realize she was a vapid, controlling, abusive bitch). But right now that wound is weeping and fresh, and feels self inflicted. I lost my charisma and charm. I don’t shower EVERY day, let alone twice a day like I used to. When I look in the mirror I avoid my own gaze, quickly darting my eyes from the toothpaste encrusted glass that is overdue for a cleaning. I walk into my room and lay on my bed. I open my iPhone. Maybe I’ll do a shot, maybe I won’t. I binge watch seasons of shows that I’ve heard are good. I’m catching up on the fucking Wire while I’m simultaneously, slowly killing myself and wasting every shred of talent I have.

How much talent is that? I don’t know, that’s hard to quantify. Some people are amazed at my intelligence. Their astonishment offends me, but it only stings because it touches on an excruciating truth. I don’t LOOK like I’d be an amazing writer, I look like a fucking junkie. I wear sweatpants every day. If I can keep food down, it’s ice cream or macaroni and cheese. I used to cook every meal, clean eat, and be finishing up an intense workout by 11 am.

So if you are a smoker, use a foil tooter (straw).  Before you take your first hit, breath out of the straw and make sure it is a bit humid inside the tube.  Then, as you take your first hit, be sure to breath out of the same straw (exactly reverse to how you breathed in to begin with).  This will make sure that it builds up residue much much faster and you will be able to enjoy this longer.  If you are going to breath out anyway, you might as well do so with your tooter and capture that smoke.  Just remember to store the tooter in an open place so it will dry out - otherwise it gets gross and wet!

I have been an addict for ten years, and I have never stolen from my family. Sure, I am done things that I am not proud of because of my addiction, but overall I am still a thoughtful kind person who is grateful for all the help I have gotten from my friends and family.

These people are using their addiction as an excuse to act like compete assholes, when in reality, that is just who they are.

This makes us all look bad. A normal person watching the show sees that and think that all of us are like that, when in reality, these people are just garbage to begin with. 

(This is a getealization, and some of the people on the show are just fine, but the assholes on that show are what drives me crazy)",1490146334.0

I am a long-time drug forum lurker now working for the Washington Heights CORNER Project in NY, where I'm involved in drug education and online outreach. The CORNER Project is a community-based organization that mainly works with homeless folks who use drugs-- typically IV heroin-- to help improve their health and quality of life. We have an operating Syringe Exchange Program and offer free naloxone trainings, health services, support groups, care coordination, and peer education. 

AskSasha is a persona that we've cooked up in order to expand our reach to the online community and offer drug use advice-- particularly in regard to heroin/opioids and cocaine-- and resources to anyone who needs them. I've been asked to act as ""Sasha"" since I am frankly obsessed with psychoactive substances. For some background, I received my BA in Neuroscience and Behavior, during which time I focused on drugs and human behavior. I've assisted teaching college classes, consulted for several local groups, published some pieces, and still work in two labs that deal with these topics. So to be fair, I've been very busy during my lurking days collecting as much data and information as I can on this subject, and hopefully I can now provide much more useful contributions than I would've otherwise. Heroin and cocaine are the major focuses of our organization, but honestly, I love to talk about all drugs so you'll likely see me on a few different subreddits. That being said, if anyone is in New York and wants free naloxone (opioid overdose antidote) and syringes delivered, please message me. Anonymity is assured.

We also want to hold online naloxone training sessions for anyone interested (likely Skype or FB live). These trainings will also focus on dosing and using when fentanyl is a likely possibility, as over 50% of the street samples we recently tested from our area were positive for the more potent opioid. Once again, please message me if you are interested in attending one of these trainings, and I will be more than happy to let you know when/ how we are planning to hold them. 

(I really hope this doesn't violate Reddit rules-- esp. regarding the naloxone offer-- but please let me know if it does! Just wanted to make sure folks knew that they have a way to get this incredibly important resource for free.)",1490113918.0

My Heroin usage is a little more than a 10 bag to feel anything. Yesterday a friend let me try a 8mg Suboxone sublingual strip, and I took about 5 milligrams.

My question is, since to my recollection the sub half life or length of the 'high' is 24 hours, if I wake up and take the other 2 1/2 or so mg. with 5 hours left until the 24 hr. point of taking the first 5 or so mg, will I catch a good buzz?

Well, the surgery is currently scheduled for monday. Having had no experience going to the doc during my addiction, naturally i told him i didnt use any drugs. But the surgery involves anesthesia and i just found out that could potentially kill me if i continue using. I just did what i plan on being my last shot before the surgery, giving me about 4 days clean time before i go under. Now, obviously i need to tell the doc that im an addict, but the front desk nurse made me sign the paper that says they can talk to my parents about the surgery. (When i tried to put that they couldnt talk to anyone about it, she said that i had to put someone cause i was going under and that i also had to put my parents because im still on their insurance and theyre going to be paying the bills). So, i have several questions. How do i go about telling the doc before the surgery without him telling my parents? Should i tell him ive only been clean for 4-5 days, or will it not make a difference if i tell him ive been clean for 2 weeks? (I feel like hed be less likely to tell my parents if i tell him ive been clean for a couple weeks instead of a couple days and it may make him less hesitant about giving me stronger pain meds) also, how do i tell him i need better pain meds than tylenol #3 and motrin for after the surgery without sounding like a junkie?

So I ask for help from this friendly community to answer a few of the questions that I have regarding my recent relapse. 

First off how long would you think heroin could possibly be detected in urine under these conditions?
-I have used heroin for around 3 months prior to getting clean.
-I have been clean for around 6 days after maybe a bit of weening.
-I have used 0.1-0.14 smoked all in one go tonight on the night of day 6.

I really need to know because I have a drug test sometime in the next 2-3 tops i'm positive so I need to be able to detox once again , but given the fact that I was most likely clean at time of relapse, and usage was minimal will I should up positive for heroin In the next 2-3 days. (I was previously using Kratom, Xanax, Vitimins, Nutrients, Protein Shakes, and lots of Marijuana if that matters.)

The method I think I will use for detox will be activated charcoal, plenty of water, vitamins, and steamy showers 2 times a day until drug test.
I apologize for the boring post I've just have very little experience with having a time frame to detox, and as unfortunate enough it is that I have to do this, I really have the inner willingness to get sober, and even though I was using a lot, it was a short period of time to a relative  long-term opiate users. I already know that I am going to get at least a few great helpful comments from the people who know the substances effects on the body the most, so thank you so much r/opiates in advance for having my back!",1490258362.0

Im 22 & have been using for about 4 years now. I am 21 days clean today. (515 hours, i set a stopwatch 24 hours after my last time using before quitting.

The physical withdrawals are over but the depression is horrible. I don't get what Im suppose to do now with my life now. Everything is so boring and I have no motivation what so ever. 

Ohh plus all my friends are gone, which I don't blame them for. Bc I've been a terrible person the past 3 years. My family thinks of me as the druggie. 'hes hopeless', 'hes gonna die first out of all us', 'i hope you overdose', or 'go shoot up' is some of the common things Im told in any minor disagreement. (not by my mother thankfully ❤️)

me: hey bro quit using my deodorant, you have a job buy your own. 

brother: go fucking od you faggot. 

this coming from my kid brother who use to look up to me, come to me when people were picking on him or took his bike to fix shit. now im the scum of the earth and that kinda hurts. 

Ive been hiding basically the past 3 weeks. I havent talked to my baby momma or even inquired about my baby girl (10 months old) in 22 days since I dropped her off. shes starting to get pissed. Not that I dont love my baby girl its just the anxiety has been crippling honestly. 

Im broke as fuck, on probation for a year. Ohh except Ive been running from that for about 6 months now. So as soon as im caught or turn myself in I get to do 2 months in county jail, yay fucking me! I doubt when thats over anyone will even be there to pick my ass up. 

I cant get an id to get a job until that shit is taken care of because of a warrant block. Thank you very much to the fuck boi who stole my wallet! Really appreciate that, hope the 0$ that was in it got you far. Wasnt even real fucking leather. 

So what the fucking fuck should I do? I have NO clue. 

I thought things were supposed to get better.. Everything is worse.. And now as a 22 year old man ive just thrown a pity party. Yay me woohoo. 

Been looking at all this dope porn and really want to use. But feel so hopeless And down 

I literally dont mentally or physically have the energy to do this anymore. The hustling up money, waiting on 'T's' stupid mumbling ass to show up 3 hours late, pull into my driveway blasting music at 2 in the morning. 

THIS SHIT IS DEAD AS FUCK!!!!!!!!!!!

I love this sub because even though we're all different, we're all the same. And the same goes for every heroin addict - we just all have different experiences. And I wanna read about some of them.

Now. Oxy same way... But you have shavings. Heat... Mix... It's gonna stick to the needle or razaor as you mix.  Just. Remove from heat bad scrape it in spoon. Keep at it . You want a brown goo. Should be consistent gooey mess. Shock it with 2ml saline... Mix it... Try to get the stuff to dissolve. It all won't. Draw it up through cotton.... Add more water.. Heat.... Mix..

Today was different. I've been having trouble hitting, so by the time I got the shit in my veins my arms were covered in blood. Sitting in my roommate's car in the underground parking lot, I didn't even have time to take the rig out before I knew something was wrong. I looked over at my man, and his eyes were open, but I could tell he wasn't there. I got cleaned up a bit, panic setting in quickly as I started to trip. I could hear him breathing (I've developed quite an ear for it after counting his breaths so many times before) so I knew he wasn't overdosing. I've never experienced anything like it. It felt like the worst acid trip of my life. My head was spinning, I was paranoid, and I was yelling at him, ""Babe, help me! Something is wrong!"" He didn't seem to hear me. He barely blinked. 

After about a half an hour of trying to get him to come back to me, he finally came to enough for us to get out of the car and get our stuff together and head back up to the apartment. 

Man, I thought I wasn't coming back from that. I thought I was going to be lost to the insanity. I figured we'd die there, just two junkies dead in a car, and if not that I was fated to be the crazy lady limping down the street yelling nonsense that people avoid. That wasn't fucking heroin.

During the period when you were becoming physically dependent on opiates did you realise it was happening? If you did then how did you justify it in your mind? Did you make any kind of active decision to go through with it? Or were you so caught up in using that you didn't give it too much thought.

Suicide that is. Done properly this is supposed to send the bullet into the part of the brain that turns out your lights for good.  Well, I am sure the fact that it is 45 hollow point will help as well.  I will setup plastic sheeting also since that will help whoever has to cleanup this mess. UGH! No no no. Get out of my head, I try to once again focus on my task at hand.



I had hoped that going to work on my third day of kicking would keep me (my mind) occupied. I could keep this persistent thought of suicide shoved to the back. Never to be brought out into the light.  No such luck. Just became harder to focus on my work.

Next question, when?  Does it matter, no I guess not. Next question.  Should I write brief notes to the people who will be left wondering how they could have helped me?

Sick of puking, kicking, insomnia, panic attacks, sweats and chills, sick of fighting suicide ideation.  Just sick, whether I am ""well"" with a recent hit, it doesn't matter. Damage is done. I am sick, and it is terminal. 


Sigh, I don't want to die. I pickup my phone, find the number, send the text; ""how you doing, you good?""  No response. Well let me give him a minute or five or until I spray my brains onto the plastic.


I know my own weak spots or rather my mind knows them, my brain waits until I am properly weakened. Usually within 2-3 days of last dose I am truly in despair. No sleep for 3 nights will do it. It then begins, the reasoning. Hey body, I tell you what. Let's pick a little bit up just to get some sleep. Nothing more, we will use it very carefully, make it last, you know what I mean?  Ha ha, yea right! I've fallen for that before, at least a dozen times. 


Well I still have the .45 with a full magazine. How I managed to keep it all this time is beyond me.  It's sits in my nightstand while home and center console while driving, my pocket when on foot. I had it for what, 19 years, wow it has been a while. Where does the time go?  I must have saved it just for this. It will be honored to help free me of this world and hand me along to the next.


Plastic sheeting is in the garage, check. Got the gun, check.  Still have to write the letters. Fuck it , I will just leave a note addressed to anyone who might care about the why, they can discuss it amongst themselves at my funeral. Alright, alright I give in. 


My phone goes off, incoming txt, ""yea I'm good come over"". I answer ""be right there"". Hurting. As usual.

Our family supports him through the process each time but it's painful to watch him throw up and be in so much pain. He just finished up detoxing at home and was in bad condition for three weeks but got through it and started working again. 

In the past him working often led him to relapse due to having income and because of the dull nature of his job he once told me. I got a call from him and he told me he was in jail but wouldn't tell me for what besides the codes as his jail phone call was recorded. The front desk representative didn't have any more information surrounding his arrest besides him being with others who were also under the influence.

The codes were 11550/11364 which after looking up appeared to include;

11550: ""Willfully using or being under the influence of a ""controlled substance"" or an illegally obtained narcotic drug subjects you to prosecution under this section.""

This includes; stimulants, depressants, hallucinogens, and opiates. Specific drugs appear to include methamphetamines, heroin, cocaine, and PCP.

11364 is similar to the above code but for possession.

He's set to be released from jail in the morning but other than that I'm really unsure of what will happen. Should I be concerned that he could have relapsed? Is there anything I can do to responsibly help him through this process?",1490349665.0

How about Vicodin/Percs?,"Hi Everyone, I have a scenario here and i am curious on a few things and had a few questions. Knock on wood this doesn't happen, but if it does, I was wondering a few things.

So let's say your employer decides to give you a random drug test while your working and you know you've taken Heroin basically everyday so far leading up to that test. 

1) Does anyone know what the heroin shows up as on the drug test - is it Opiates or 'Heroin' ?

2) Is there a medicine I can say I took that caused the positive on the drug test? Like let's say some magical way I could get a doctors note or a valid script, does Morphine and Heroin show up as the same thing? How about Vicodin/Percoset? 
Or is there any valid opiate pill that shows up the same as Heroin if tested?

Basically I am asking this so I am prepared if this happens. I am afraid if i am tested next week and I test positive for whatever 'H' shows up as, that my employer will ask me on the spot what I have taken? Obviously if I say Opana, it doesn't show up as the same thing as Heroin so they'd know I was lying. But I was told I could say I've taken Morphine which they would not be able to tell the difference between that and Heroin so I am just wondering.... 

Thanks for any feedback!

Now, of course they didn't put a gun to my head and make me buy and shoot. What they did do was refuse to allow my pharmacy to refill my usual monthly meds by denying a pre-authorization. 

I have been addicted for the better part of 20 years. It started when I got out of the Navy after serving as a Hospital Corpsman and took a job at a local pharmacy. I should never have taken the pills, that's totally my fault. 

We filled daily prescriptions for several area nursing homes and every kind of pill in the world was being packaged into our own little plastic wrappers for single pill distribution. We'd grab a bottle of 1000 Vicodin and feed it into the machine and it would kick out these single packaged pills with the name and strength. Those pills would be transferred into bays where others would fill drawers person by person. There was very little accountability and it was nothing to pocket 10 to 20 percocet every day.

It wasn't long before I lost that job and was dopesick on my parents couch. That was 1997. The next 20 years was a sickening blur of doctor shopping, nightmare cold turkey kicking attempts, loss of jobs and relationships, and frequent misery. I lost my fiance and my daughter, I lost the trust of my friends and family, and I lost any chance for a normal future.

Fast forward to 2014 when I heard about Suboxone. This old Jewish doctor in Florida told me not to go online and read about it, not to tell anyone I was on it (strange eh?), and that it is a miracle cure. I was sick as a dog and my first dose took the misery away like nothing. It was wonderful.

Tonight is my birthday and I've been on Subs for over three years now. I've accepted that I will probably be on Subs or something like it until either I die or they come up with a miracle cure (sorry I just dont have the balls to try the Ibogaine route and I've tried everything else). 

Oh yeah, to help fill out my medical picture I should also mention that I am a double Cancer survivor that beat Renal Cell Carcinoma by have part of my left kidney removed and I still have and will always have Follicular Lymphoma as it in currently incurable. I also have frequent kidney stones and have produced over 15 stones since 1994. My shitty health insures that even if I were to take the hard road and kick it's only a matter of time before Im back in a hospital bed in pain and receiving opiates again. I've kicked and done the tough-guy thing once or twice but eventually the pain kicks my ass, and my addiction does the rest.

Okay, that's my history so what the hell am I talking about with my state insurance forcing me onto heroin?  Well this is what happened: For the last year I had been taking my Suboxone faithfully and doing pretty well overall. Then one day I drive to my Sub doctor and pick up my prescription and drive the hour back home and drop it off at my closeby Walgreens store. That's when the shit hit the fan.

I still had 4 days Pre-auth'd from last 6 months so they were nice enough to give me 4 strips.  When I came back the next Monday I was told that my state sponsored health insurance has refused to preauthorize my prescription because I had filled the last year each month early.  They had added up the last years scripts and every month I picked up my Subs a few days early. Multiplied by 12 months and they claimed I was just over two weeks early and would have to wait.  WTF!?!

I called my Sub doctor who was sympathetic, but there was nothing he could do (or was willing to do). Each month as I took my Subs I sometimes took my dose a little early. 22 hours instead of 24. Little by little this added up over time.

I tried talking to the insurance, I tried my doctor again, I even went to the E.R. and there was nothing anyone could do. My choice was to be sick for 2+ weeks or do something about it. Most of us in this thread that live near a large city know we can score in the right neighborhood. An hour drive, hangout at a gas station, give guy in car the nod, ""do I party?"" and then ""girl or boy?"" and that is that.

The first time...I was jacked. They guy took my money and disappeared. The second try was no worries.  I didn't like what I was doing but I had a new job to start the next Monday. 

When you are on 8mg of Suboxone regular and thats ripped out from under you and literally no one else can or will help you, you do what you have to in order to get by. I did what I had to do. My insurance did refill it a little sooner than they claimed I would have to wait, but I still had to go through this bullshit for more than two weeks. Life has returned back to normal for the most part, just with a whole lot less trust for my state insurance and that bureaucracy is very very alive and well.",1490328741.0

He was asking me for advice since I'm more experienced with opiates but I wanted to see what you guys think since I've never had to have surgery while using.      
      
He smokes BTH and he doesn't have a very large tolerance, he smokes about .1 - .2 a day. I know that they will give him anesthesia. And I assume they'd give him possibly morphine or some other painkiller. Let me know if I'm wrong about that please because I'm really not sure.       
       
He mostly just wants to know whether he should smoke a point as usual and just tell the doctors what he took so they can adjust the levels of anesthesia accordingly, or if he could just smoke a bit less than usual, just enough so that he is not dopesick but also not enough to get any amount of buzz or high, would it still be very important to mention that he smoked a little? He is afraid of being flagged as an addict and having that fuck him in the future and also doesn't want to screw himself out of any pain meds that they'd give him after the surgery for while he recovers.           
        
So what do you guys think? Would he be fine to not mention it if he only takes a few hours just to not be totally sick? Or is it so dangerous that he absolutely needs to tell them even if it's a very small amount? If it is the latter would he be able to get away with saying a friend or relative gave him a spare oxy or Vicodin or something they had from an old script? If he were to just not smoke any at all, do you guys think they will give him morphine or something in the hospital before the surgery? If that is the case I could tell him to not smoke anything and just wait to get in there since the morphine or whatever they administer would get him well anyway?      
      
      
Thanks for taking the time to read this. I know that I can always count on the folks here at /r/opiates to give the best advice or of anywhere on the web for this kind of thing. I just don't feel comfortable telling him how much to smoke or whether to just not smoke at all without getting some more opinions on the matter.  ",1490318615.0

I justify with a list of things- no kids or family yet, cheap AF housing with no more than a 1.5 mile drive to the office building and only half a mile to the university where I study, good investments and safety nets, no debt beyond student loans, blah blah blah..... I'm sure you can all guess pretty well what I did with some of that check instead of saving it....

Well, I went with my buddy to my old neighborhood this afternoon so he could sell some shit to platos closet and he didn't know how to navigate that side of the city. I took him to dinner next door at my favorite restaurant of all time because A) I LOVE it when I have an excuse to be in <nickname of my old hood> and B) I had a leftover gift card for there with about $20 on it

So a lady comes in and asks if I can buy her a quesadilla because she's homeless and hungry. Didn't want money to go get food later or whatever, didn't act anywhere close to as weird as I've seen many in the same damn city trying to guilt people into giving them money- she just asked politely and explained she had been saving for a new roll up pad for her tent and would be able to get it today if she could eat for free (she said she lives in tent city- which is in a very hard-to-see area under the largest freeway interchange in the city to avoid law/civilian harassment - it's also by a small creek surrounded by rocky and gravelly terrain so a pad makes sense tbh)

So ya I was already buying myself and my friend dinner with a gift card, I'd already wasted a little bit of that paycheck on things that will be gone sooner rather than later, and I still had a little extra to spare because I got my tax refund a few weeks ago and haven't decided what to do with it yet. I bought her the damn quesadilla and- GASP- a drink!!!!

So, after it all was over and she had gone her own way the manager came out and decides to tell me thank you but he wanted to me to know she does that pretty often, as well as other shit that I literally wasn't listening to because I didn't care lmao

Then I sat down and my buddy was speculating all the different ways that She coulda maybe just committed major sabotage on me because I bought her half of a meal lol... 

So I realized that the worst thing about panhandlers isn't even deciding which to ignore and which to give a little help to.... ITS THE OPINIONS AND JUDGMENTS OF ANYONE WHO SAW IT HAPPEN. Like, yes I'm aware she may just love that restaurant and be running a major long con to get a free dinner every other week there. Or that she was actually gonna buy a crack rock instead of a sleeping pad - BUT IM NOT EVEN HOMELESS AND MANY WOULD CONSIDER MY DECISION EVEN WORSE THAN IF SHE WERE TO GET A ROCK

but come on people- we can't go back in time. I don't know her. I know what it's like to be literally homeless and sleeping in a constantly agitated and terrified state on an old mattress with my boyfriend that we pulled out of someone's house who had died that day in the disaster. It's not like our own houses or even workplaces survived. We were able to get on our feet pretty quickly because of our age back then but it meant being broken up by 2500 miles of geography

I may have only slept on the street as a refugee for a week or two along with thousands of others so it's not the same at all. But I have had every single thing in my life taken from me in the snap of a finger caused by nothing but god damn wind. Who am I to tell this lady that she needs to fuck off and get a job for that quesadilla? It's not mine to judge. I could have denied her but I'd rather have been taken advantage of in the smallest way tonight than to have denied someone who has possibly had everything ripped away for whatever reason! If she was lying or running a scam I honestly don't care; if I didn't have the money to afford to do it then I definitely wouldn't have. But I did, and it was less than the cost of a damn Percocet that someone tried to sell me for $12 today haha what an idiot

TL;DR- if your friend or traveling companion feels something for someone asking help on the street and throws some change or even food/supplies their way, just let them be at peace with the decision. Most all adults in this world know that people will take advantage, lie, cheat and steal rather than being honest and hard-working. But just as many people hit rock bottom daily and for some, it's such a deep pit that it may take years or decades to climb out of.

That shit really irks me.

So I was with my D'boy, parked in my driveway having a drawn out conversation about credit history & car insurance (as he has neither), etc. He gets a phone call halfway through and tells the guy on the other end. ""I'mma hit you back later, I'm with my fiend right now"" and hangs up.
 
Now I've had other D'boys I've dealt with call me that shit before, but this really pissed me the fuck off. More so because I was relaying information of genuine value to him at the time, and it seemed he was actually intrigued (as it directly pertains to him and his current situation)

I think he robbed me because he's a lonely loser who says I only call him when I need dope, yet other than that we have nothing in common so I don't see why he cares and it's not like I was mean to him anyways. I have reasons not to want to associate with him though. and honestly, yes the only thing i like him for is him getting dope. Fuck, he was the one who got me some when i relapsed and had 11 months clean beforehand. I have no good memories really with this weird dude. Here's why he creeps me out:

-The first time i met him two summers ago he was wearing a pink ladies underwear.

-He asked me to take some strange asian looking viagra pills with him one time, pretending not to know what they were 

-He said twice that if i od he would just leave me there to die"" then says just kidding

-He will demand like 5 bags or just middle man and take my dope and pretend like hes taking it then give it back like hes teaching me a lesson or something.

-He faked an OD like twice one day with his shirt off as like I was going to give him mouth to mouth cpr... was so fucked up

-Most negative human being I know, yet acts like I'm supposed to be his good friend. I feel sorry for him. He has ruined his life and hes a prime example of what I don't want to be.

Anyways, this fucking weasel robbed me today. First i called saying to meet me, then when i called him his location he said whats in it for me? I was like wtf.. you dont have to do it and he demanded 6 bags so i called him a retard and went back home.

Then he texted me like a minute later, saying he was just joking, but his attitude was all nice for some reason. i should of seen it coming. he was like, lets split a bundle, you put in 50 ill put in 50. im like sure okay..? and then i gave him the money, and this time he just left. he blocked me on facebook and shit lol but i know where the fucker lives.

I also found his facebook again on another account. I am going to make a facebook profile in his name with the picture of him shooting dope. its pretty graphic picture lol. the reason i have it, is a reminder for what i dont ever want to stoop to. this is the grimiest motherfucker i ever met and he was so doped out he didnt even know i took the pic. so im going to pretend to be him under his name, with the fucked up picture of him shooting dope as the profile picture, than add all his family members who like almost all have disowned him or family that might still think hes a good guy lmao. is that too much? lol

The subject really says it all; I've been opiate free for three months today (minus a quick, 3 day bupe taper), and I feel fucking fantastic. Basically I found myself at a crossroads, where I could either continue burrowing my way back into the life I lived for 6 years - before initially getting clean from January-april last year - or get my shit together and focus on living.

I chose the latter this time, and while of course it hasn't been easy, it's amazing what you can get out of life when you get outside of the tunnel vision of this game.

I love dope. I will always love the ritual, the pure ecstasy of seeing that crimson mushroom cloud exploding up a rig when I register, and then the warm, blissful embrace that comes from a simple push. But even having typed that out and relived it in my mind, I know that I want more out of life than just that; and for me it's always going to be an either/or, all or nothing situation. I want to love and be loved, I want to participate in society, and I want to form and maintain real, lasting, substantial relationships. In just 3 months I'm well on my way to having those things. I'm putting the pieces of my life back together, and for the first time in over half a decade I'm actually excited about the future. 

I know 3 months isn't shit in the long run, that the road ahead is long and treacherous, the odds are against me, that there will be bad days/weeks/even months, and that I'm still perilously close to relapse whether I think so or not. But I'm looking forward to being the person I was supposed to be, to winning this battle, and the next one, and the next one, and actually LIVING my life. 

Sorry for the braggy shit-post, but it's Friday night, I've got money in my pocket, nothing really going on, and no desire to go out and get high. So take a look at my handle - there's no hyperbole there - that was probably the most accurate description of me possible when I created this account; and if I can get here, then so can you. If you're blissfully nodding off in ecstasy, be careful, obviously, but enjoy the hell out of it...more power to ya...As I said I fucking love it. But if you're sick of it, if you want out but just don't see a way...Don't give up. You absolutely can change your life. If this piece of shit junky can do it there's no doubt in my mind you can too.

Again, sorry for this rambling mess, but I'm feeling good tonight, and I hope y'al are too! Happy nods to all my bropiates; but if you're unhappy with your nods, feel free to pm me, if only just to vent, or whatever.

Man, its' been a LONG 5 months. I've been clean since October 20th, 2016. I thought I'd miss Reddit, but I don't.

I'm on 16mg of Suboxone. Working from home full-time, as a web developer, and spending time with my family.

Today is my 27th birthday. This time last year, my addiction started driving my life into the ground. I ended up living in my boyfriends car for 5 months before entering treatment. Being homeless, hungry, and withdrawing is a position I NEVER want to be in again.

 Just the simple fact that I'm clean now, and working on my life, showed my dad he can trust me to live in his house again.

My boyfriend are no longer together, but hes better off. He has a decent job, and living with his parents almost 12 hours away.

I spent 3 years high on anything I could touch, but Suboxone has given me my life back. I don't even THINK about getting high. Sure, I do miss the people sometimes, but I'm not sure I can say I miss heroin.

I love you guys. 

What's happened on the sub in the last 5 months? I wanna hear from you!

I was watching out the windows of the store and sure enough the Cop drives over to my car and hovers around it, parks next to it, in front of it, behind it, I was like woah wtf is he doing. I'm like ok I will check back my shits legit, I'm walking around Goodwill and I turn around and the fucking Cop is right there, ""is that your car?""

I normally have to drive over 30 mins, a couple times a day, to pay $35 to $40 *per* blue.

My perc girl is 10 mins from my house, and charges $5 each for 10/325 percs which is a kick ass price for oxy. So that's less than half of what i usually pay, not to mention the gas savings alone.

So I usually eat 2 to 3 blues (60-90mg) at a time to feel good and will usually start wishing i had more within 3 hour or so. This morning around 11, I ate 8 percs (80mg) and was high as fuck all day. Finally, i went and picked up more around 3:30....still high but needed to stock up for the evening, ended up taking 9 of them (CWE) and am currently declaring UNCLE! NO MORE.

I'm so fucking high I'm nodding my ass off and it's all I can do to write this post. It's what I *wish* taking blues did to me but they just fucking don't. I **never** nod on blues unless I throw weed into the equation. There have been some really good threads on whether percs (OXY/APAP) is stronger (subjective term) than the equvalent oxy-only offering. In my experience the oxy/apap is orders of magnitude stronger.

I digress....the point is that I'm really fucking high, almost *annoyingly* high, thanks to percs and will be retardedly high for over a week. Good stuff.",1490394302.0

Going to stop it before it spirals out of control. Thoughts?,"Hey y'all. Long ass post ahead but plz read if u have time. Thx

So about a month ago I posted here about getting my first 30 day chip and ended up getting quite a big response. First, I'd just like to thank y'all from the bottom of my heart for that, and for being so supportive. I've been here a couple years at this point, and I'm not a super frequent poster (I'd like to think some of you recognize my name when I post) but still, I always feel super welcome and try to give back with harm redux tips whenever I can

Anyway. So I ended up using last week. Just once. But it ended up being kind of a tease.. and you know how that goes. Always chasing that 10/10 nod city bish etc etc.

Long story short, I used two days on, 1 day off, then 4 days straight, skipped a day, and then again tonight. Realized today that I was starting down the same rabbit hole as last time and deleted my connects phone number, && literally anyone who could give it to me if I asked, as he's the only one still around these days. Also haven't talked to any of my dope friends(deleted their info months ago)  and have a pretty big, great support group of ""Normie"" friends and family so I think I'm good on that front, plus I'm going into an outpatient Monday to help keep me accountable.

My real question is, how fucked am I in terms of WD? Idk if it's my brain chemistry or I'm just a lil pussy, but I could NEVER work through withdrawal. Just couldn't do it. It was withdrawals that caused me to lose my job the first time around, and triggered my descent from a long win streak of ""functioning addict"" to ""broke homeless theiving junkie"". and I literally can't do that this time cuz my job and stable financial situation are the only things keeping me from using. And keeping a roof over my head. If I lose this job/living situation then that's A home I don't know if I'll be able to get myself out of, and things are going so well.. I don't know if I'd wanna keep living if I ended up on the street hooked on dope again. Hence why I'm trying to nip this in the bud now.  I have acces to a small amount of benzos, I have 3/4 of an 8mg sub tab, some clonidine, and the local smoke shop sells kratom as well.

Any tips for getting they work if the withdrawals *will* be pretty bad? And *would then even be that bad?*  How bad would they be after 30 days clean after a year of smoking roughly a half G a day, followed by roughly once a day for a week (with a couple lil gaps as I mentioned above)?.How can I properly take these meds to get thru work this week? How long will these WDs  last?

Anyway, much love everyone, sorry I let y'all down. I was debating even telling you guys cuz so many were so happy to see me clean but it's better that I'm being honest with y'all, as well as myself. For once. Outside knowledge of my shit really helps me stay accountable so I figured I'd do it.

Love y'all and thx in advance <3",1490518637.0

I'm feeling pretty sad rn I've been home for the past few days. Some things have happened, I've been able to stay high so my problem isn't about dope directly. I think I'm feeling a combination of joy and misery. I've made amends with my family. Things are great, best they've been in years. 

Being home has been amazing. Catching up with people i haven't seen or spoken to in years. Being in a comfortable and familiar environment is just good for my mental health. 

Anyways onto what's bugging me, it's a girl.
Now I'm 19 and have little experience in 'serious' relationships. I've had one gf I'd considered serious but I didn't feel atall the same as I do about her (I could just be being young and dumb) but I can see a future with this girl. I'd go as far as to say I love her. 

Anyway i get home and we're talking and she tells me she feels pretty much the same way about me. Now I'm so excited and just over the fucking moon tbh. Then it hits me like a ton of bricks. I'm going back to England soon. 

Now i could just say fuck it and not go back to England and be a homeless junkie, which is fine by me. I can deal with that lifestyle. I'm more worried about her. 

If she loves me would I be best to walk away now ? She's a uni student from a good background. I'm worried I'll drag her down and into this life of addiction. I'm also worried that she feels as though she can fix me and I can't put her through the hurt of my lies. 

She's my rock and I'm hers. We tell each other everything with no judgement but I can't lie to her in a serious relationship. It'd kill me. 

Please help me here or give me some advice. I'm so conflicted. ",1490510200.0

At least in my circles, its taken on a lot of the characteristics we associate with the n-word: I might call myself a junkie, and other junkies can call me a junkie, that's fine.  But if a straight calls one of us a junkie, get ready for a fight.

Anyway, my question is this - what do you guys think 'qualifies' someone to be called a junkie? Is it about severity of their habit, frequency of use, or what? To me, a lot of people use opiates. An opiate user, even if they're addicted, isn't necessarily a junkie. A junkie is someone that does junkie shit. You use everyday but it comes from your script? Not a junkie, even if you did milk things a bit to have the doc bump you up to the good stuff.  Use the same amount, but pay for it by stealing aluminium from air conditioners?

So, i currently am an opiate addict and my girlfriend is not. She used to use all sorts of drugs daily, for about 2-3 years. Her DOC were/are stimulants. She was not ""addicted"" to any particular substance, as far as she knows, but used all kinds of drugs everyday. Sometimes this and sometimes that, hope you get what im trying to explain. :P 
In 2011 she went ""cold turkey"" on everything else besides cannabis and occasional alcohol.
These days she smokes cannabis, almost daily, and drinks alcohol 3-6 times a month. She also takes small doses of opiates or benzos VERY rarely, for medicinal purposes. (for example to get a good night of sleep after being sleep deprived for a long time/if she has been stressed out for a long time and wants to release it/take a break, using drugs as a tool) 
Of course she enjoys the pleasurable effects also, but that is not the main reason why she sometimes dabbles with these substances.

So, now that I think ive covered her drug use im gonna get to the point:
She would like to know how it feels to be in withdrawal, so that she could understand me better.
How should we do this, or should we do this at all? One way would be to get her addicted by dosing her daily for a while and then stop. But it is risky because it might lead to her being addicted to opiates. Because, like we all know, it is quite enjoyable to be on opiates and she might get ""used"" to it. 
The other idea i had, which i think would be more suitable, is precipitated withdrawal induced by buprenorphine. Maybe give her a nice dose of something, like 30-90mg of codeine and then have her snort some subutex. What opiate do you we should use in this ""experiment"", if we are going to do this?

What do you guys think? Would this even induce withdrawal symptoms for her?
And if it would work, could there be any negative consequences from this little ""experiment""?

What do you think? Please say anything that comes to your mind on the matter.

But we still use on occasion. The methadone has improved our lives a ridiculous amount. It has truly been a godsend. We were homeless before the methadone, and during that time out tolerance had gone down a lot.

Anyways, we wanted to use today, and had only $40 to spend. My guy in the suburbs lost his plug earlier this week, and now he sticks to meth. So without him, I have to go into the city for dope, which is a 30min drive, without traffic. I call up one guy, and a girl answers, she says he's not around. So I call another guy who I've been going through about three years, who lives a bit further. He says come through. I tell him it will be 30-45 minutes.

I get to his area after 40 minutes, and there's no answer when I call. I wait about half an hour, blowing up his phone a bit. Still nothing. One guy driving by asks if I need any kush (my city's slang term for K2 or other synth' 'noids), and when I say no, he starts listing off stuff I may want. I tell him a 40 of black, and he says to wait for two minutes. I of course didn't give him my money, so whatever.

I see him drive to an apartment complex where I know a guy who deals dope is living. This is a guy I don't like because his weights are so inconsistent and his dope just isn't that good. So I don't go through him anymore. The guy doesn't come back and after another 15 minutes, during which time I was still calling my guy. I say fuck it, he's not coming back, so I jump on the motorcycle and head up towards the open air spot.

So I head there and circle around the block. There's not many people out, but I recognize a few ladies at the bus stop. So I go down a few blocks to park and walk back over, to be less conspicuous. I don't normally cold cop because there's scammers, the bags are often small, cut with sugar, weak, etc. Plus all the people who I knew over there who would just set me up with a dealer or had good, consistent bags, have either quit, been locked up, or are just not there anymore.

As I'm walking, I see my old favorite corner boy. He's an old Mexican man with no front teeth. He had been MIA for months. Rumors were rampant, but the most common one was he had gone to Mexico to pick up for some cartel, and had fucked them over somehow, and was on the run from them. There was even supposedly a price on his head. But there's always gossip among that community. But either way, I was very surprised to see him.

I tell him what I need, and he says one minute, walks off, and comes back with it for me and two other people he had waiting on the block nearby. It's two small 20s, which is how it's normally sold if you have to buy out on the corner. They were about the average size for what's sold in that area for $20, which I'd say is ~.1g. I was skeptical. Honestly disappointed. His bags were normally the proper amount, and much bigger than the competition's. I get on the motorcycle and ride to a place I knew of nearby to do it. (I was homeless in that city and that area, so I knew where I could go)

I get to the place. Tell my girlfriend what's up over the phone. Cook up one bag, saving one for her. When I shoot up, I realize that it's really good. I even got some pins and needles. Her and I had split .45g between the two of us the day before and I hadn't nodded, and had barely even gotten high. But this .1 left me nodding in and out uncontrollably where I was sitting for a good 20, 25 minutes, while trying to put my shit away. I had continued to nod for about an hour after that, and am finally starting to get control to where I'm comfortable driving my motorcycle. Until then, I'm just going to chill here.

But anyways, I was very surprised! It made me very happy to say the least. It was glorious. Not only was it the best rush I've had in three weeks, it was one of the smallest shots I had done in that same period of time. It was great. I loved it. I can't wait for my girlfriend to get to do her half. Sorry that story was so long.

TL;DR: Girlfriend and I are on methadone. Decided to use today. Only had $40 for two people. The only guy I can reach stands me up. So I have to cold cop. I run into my old favorite corner boy, who I thought was gone for good. I get two small 20s, each about .1g. I am very disappointed. Then I actually do one of the 20s, and it's the best high I've had in weeks. Good day today.",1490490034.0

So it's been ~ a month since my wife split and for like the first week or two i had irrefutable proof of her fucking pretty much any guy that'd get her high, and doin other skeezy shit. Despite that i was being a sucker and wanted nothing more than to have my family back together. Didn't help the whole time she was doing all of this i was being told she loved me, wanted to work shit out, etc.. (she didn't know i had all the evidence of what she was doin).

For the last two weeks i've been coming to grips with what's goin on but it's still shitty. I've been on like a month long binge after being clean for 3-4mo's and as much as i want to be clean again don't see an end in sight (can't cope w/ the misery and depression sober). She has a new BF and even tho i'm trying to avoid all things social media i'm constantly having people show me shit, etc.. that's her and him being all lovey dovey and it's fucking heart wrenching. Thanks to this no contact i can't even try and get any sorta closure and i'm left wondering if she ever loved me and if so htf could she do this to me.

Anyways, sorry for the long shit post, just figured there would be a few people here interested/atleast wanting to know i was alive. Things are supposed to be getting better but it's stlil a shit show and i'm starting to lose hope. Anyone that read this is a trooper, thx for giving a shit enough to waste 2 minutes of your life. Haters can save the hate i'm hating myself/my life enough right now and don't need your help. Those of you that have shown me love/support i appreciate it way more then i can even begin to articulate.",1490484567.0

For about a year i've had a pretty nasty Oxy 30 habit (Roxis). Ive tried kicking the habit twice before. Once this last December (My plug went dry and I went through 2 days and once he reupped...boom) and this last month in February (Where I went 5 days clean and said ""Hey one can't hurt right?""). Finally this will be the last time,never will i touch these dreaded things again. I have two different strains of Kratom on hand and have already dosed myself with 7g of Bali Kratom. I have about 5 grams left of this and then 32 grams of Maenga da Silver Kratom.
My last Dose was at 3/24 at around 11pm to almost midnight. 12 hours from my last dose I woke up feeling a bit of WDs. Slight Diarreha (Or maybe I just finally took a shit), headache and the chills for sure. Felt like absoulte shit to be honest with you guys. I open my drawer and take out my trusty Kratom Capsules and toss them onto my bed. I take 12 of them and wait. Also taking 12 capsules is so horrible just thank god that i'm used to taking pills, I used Animal Pak which is a multivatmin with around 10 pills, or else I would have had to resort to tea.
I thought I felt no effect and kept waiting. Slowly the chills subsided and I felt a small burtst of energy. I wasn't satisfied and i instead took 2 more caps to total 7g (I forgot to say that each capsule has .5g of Kratom). I took a nice hot shower and brushed my teeth. As I got out I noticed I wasnt sensitive to slight cold anymore which I should be because of WDs and me just taking a shower. The Kratom had worked, right now im sitting at my desk with no WDs at all. I have a huge burst of almost jittery energy so I had decided to type this out now im gonna occupy myself with some NBA 2k17. Also I had the motivation to actually eat something. I will keep this updated as I go through the rest of the 3 days of the ""heavy"" wds and then i'm gonna try to drop the kratom and just go free of anything.
Lastly at around 2:45 pm (16 hours after last dose) I smoked about a .3 of some very heavy Sativa Blue dream.",1490471877.0

I was just thinking about a few from my current job and decided to try to get you guys to pitch in on a fun thread featuring tales from our jobs. Obviously I'll go first. 

I work in a specialized department where everyone (for the most part) on my team was hand selected for standing out as good employees. We have to be on the ball 95% of the time that we are on the job or someone could get hurt. 

Well we had this one really strange/different guy that I'll call M. If you just think of everything normal people do this kid did the opposite of just something that made zero sense. ""What's up, M, happy Friday."" M- ""Is it really? Everything is happy because of the day in the week? Did you know in Syria kids are being blown up daily by our government?"" I'd just walk away wondering why I even continued trying to be nice to him. One day he was standing in an aisle eating a massive cheeseburger which is a big no no. He liked to incorporate your name into little raps. ""What up Shane, how's the pain, today will it rain, I'm working in vain.""  Trash like that. 

I knew he smoked and fucked with bars, but I started noticing him straight up sleeping standing up by his cart. I know bars make me do that sometimes, but after a couple months I just KNEW he was nodding out. I talked to his friend and he said he had no idea what he was on but agreed that he was getting worse. 

One day he was nodding out by some potentially dangerous equipment so I went to talk to him and told him he should go home if he couldn't stay awake. Less than 5 minutes after I walked away a manager caught him with his forehead resting against this dangerous machinery. M was out cold. 

They suspended him pending a drug test which originally came back inconclusive, but he never came back. He hit me up for $20 a couple months after he admitted it was heroin, but he said he was on pst and just needed an emergency phone, so I gave him a bunch of food, drinks, and more than $20 because I honestly knew I'd never see him again. Last I heard he moved up north with his mom to get clean. 

Story number two was this dude named J. He was pretty cool and I was his trainer, so we talked a lot. I quickly learned that he did H when he saw a sub strip in my wallet and asked to buy some for his sick days. I declined because I need every one, and after a couple months he just started leaving for 30-45 minutes at a time to meet his dboy. 

Well, after a while he started being watched because I assume word got around that he was leaving. So he started making up reasons why he had to leave for an hour or so. He told his boss one time that his girlfriend's car broke down at the trap house they guy their drugs from and she was in danger being there. 

He was drug tested and fired the next day. They let him go get his chick that day though. Dude was crazy. 

So whatcha got? I'm on mobile or I'd type more, but I'm dying to hear some stories!

Edit: Just remembered being a valet. I worked a summer at a horse racing track running cars. I got into such good shape I could literally run full speed every car I went after because I was also on oxy. Saturday nights consisted of a 2-3 hour rush at the end when everyone was trying to leave simultaneously. 

It was pouring rain one night and I pulled at least 65 cars that night. Such good money. My boss was my age, maybe a year or two older. He asked when we were gonna go grab some drinks and catch a game at a bar. They went out drinking all the time. I didn't like hanging around any of the younger guys cuz they all listened to trash like Drake and Lil Wayne and that basegod douchebag. 

The funny part is when me and my boss went out, midway through the first drink, he goes, ""so what's your thing?""  I was confused but he said ""you're like a fucking machine. Even Damian (played college football) says it's insane how you don't get tired...so what's your thing. Did you run cross country?""

I ended up telling him I would pop a roxy 30 every 3 hours or so, and at night it was xanax after work. Coolest boss I've ever had. Now we're just good friends. ",1490467433.0

I personally have purchased enough naloxone to save my entire neighborhood. 


If allowed by the mods I will share the specific companies. 


Not mentioning sources, I have discovered that major chemical retailers do not require any specific paperwork to obtain naloxone. 


Many states allow citizens to possess naloxone legally without a prescription.  Ordering the powder is legal in these states and hundreds of times less expensive than prescription naloxone.


Harm reduction groups are required to use prescription products and their funding is hammered by the cost. You as an individual are not held back by these restrictions. I know that the initial investment costs a little more than one hundred dollars however you and your friends/families lives are worth it. 


I hope this post has helped at least one person. 


Mods if I am out of line, please correct me.

Edit: Make sure you obtain training on the use of naloxone. Naloxone is not a permanent solution to overdose. When naloxone wears off the old drugs are still in the body; this can lead to another overdose. All overdoses should be treated as potentially fatal and users should seek urgent care. ",1490465490.0

I can't afford enough dope to last me four days, but I *know* I can afford 5 pounds of seed. If I can't find suboxone, I'll prob bring CFO AKA 'concentrated flake opium' (and while I vaguely know how to make it, any advice would be helpful .. PM's are welcome, so we don't blow up the spot of our last semi-legal alternative). My only concern is the shelf-life .. Seed tea won't survive storage longer than 24-30 hours before it starts to go bad, so how can I keep my CFO from turning? There's little worse I can imagine than going through withdrawal with food poisoning on a family vacation in a southern state (all while missing Stevie Wonder and Snoop Dogg). I won't be able to refrigerate them, so would an ice pack (that I leave in the freezer overnight, each night, then left with my CFO during the daytime) be enough to make them last for days? Or of course, do I have nothing to worry about, as far as it going bad in such a short period of time? I intend on removing as much liquid as possible (hopefully turning it into a powder), but I'm nervous to overcook it or get it stuck to the dish. I've made CFO into a powder/goop that i instantly consumed once, but never put it in a gelcap and thus don't know how that differs from poppy extract consumed as a tea.

That's a complete different story. His stroke of course was not opiate related. He took ecstasy which made him break out in a severe case of shingles due to the stress the ecstasy caused on his body (A fucking 40 year old man shouldn't be doing ecstasy) and in turn shingles can cause a stroke.

1. How long have you been using opiates? I've been using opiates in general for about five years but my doc, heroin, for three years this year. every single day since i started. 

2. Any specific drug music you like? Artists/albums/songs: My favorite band is Alice in Chains and Dirt is an awesome dope album. Also Junkhead and Godsmack are my go to using songs. 

3. What do you mix your dope in? I saw a thread like this a few days ago and saw mostly spoons. I use the little metal cookers they give you at the needle exchange, there must be hundreds around here. 

4. Have you ever had cotton fever? Too many times to count. But i still use cottons and save them. I haven't had it in a while. 

5. Where on your body are you getting off right now if you inject? I had to recently switch to my feet which honestly grosses me out but my arms and hands desperately need a break. 

6. Has opiate use ever landed you in the hospital? Yes. Infected arm. 

7. And lastly, what's the best dope you've ever had? What color did it draw up, how'd it feel, etc: My current dope, stamped Bad Boy Habit fro, the Bronx. It draws up almost clear and it's fucking amazing. It's cut with fent and it's by far the best i've had. 

Anyways that's it. Just write the number and answer the question, no need to copy and paste it all. i hope this isn't weird i'm just bored and thought it might be fun cos i always likes these dumb quizzes on myspace years and years ago. glad to join this group. ",1490625073.0

The realization came to me when a pharmacist today commented that I've been purchasing too frequently for the past six months, which seemed odd to me because I've been doing it for much longer. I then realized, that's around the time I received a new ID.

I realize this loophole will be useless next year with new regulations, but at least if this really works we can stock up in the meantime! I'll test this theory in a few days.",1490622091.0

Found some 5/325 oxy pills (512 ident) from July 2013, read some shit on the internet, decided to take 15 as a first dose. 


Since then I've been laying down watching Jurassic World. Been about 1.5 hours and I feel pretty much nothing. Not even pain reduction. For a second awhile ago I felt a little surge of something but then nothing. Kinda pissed. 


So some questions for you lovely folks, think they may have expired? Did I not take enough? All I had to eat in the 3 hours before was a protein shake, and before that some Domino's boneless chicken.

Btw, I'm only 140lbs 5'11.

I am prescribed 3600mg daily and never had a problem picking up my meds early. My insurance will cover it up to 10 days early. However, I am out of town and had my prescription transferred to a local pharmacy and I went to pick it up 4 days before my 30 day date. They said they cannot fill it until it is within 2 days of my 30 day date. 

I was only 4 days early!  The pharmacist was extremely nice and called around to other local pharmacies and they all had the same policy.  They will not fill it until 2 days before the 30 day date. This is usually a rule for narcotic precriptions. Well now this applies to Gabapentin too due to abuse concerns in this area. 

I asked her to call across the river into a different state and the first pharmacy she called said they would fill it, no problem. So I drove 10 minutes across state lines and got it filled.  I suspect that there is a local ordinance probibiting it being filled early in the first state.

I would not be surprised if this drug gets scheduled and becomes more difficult to be filled. ",1490606198.0

(chemistry question),"Whew, talk about questions that shouldn't be asked... Anyway the other day I was trying to fathom why this sub loves that candy. It's delicious, yes, and makes for a pretty funny banner, but other than that *why sour patch?* Why not skittles or mike and ikes or combos or whatever the fuck?


When I looked at the ingredients in listed on the box of sour patch I was munching on at the time, something hit me: *I once heard that mixing a small amount of clean acidic solution improves the solubility of dope. Acidic solutions are sour. Sour patch is sour. The end result of eating sour patch is a pile of acidic crystals...* 


Every ingredient in sour patch appears to be water soluble and, with the exception perhaps of corn starch (which might contain fungal spores), harmless in an IV solution... See where I'm going?


It stands to reason that the crystals coating SPK are probably  citric acid, stearic acid or tartaric acid, and sugar, as listed in the ingredients. 


Now correct me if I'm wrong about this (source: drugbank.ca)...


The free heroin molecule is, like most drugs, alkaline. This seems readily evident from it's sharply bitter taste. Illicit heroin is also usually cut with other basic substances like caffeine or quinine to conceal the presences of other cuts, like sugar. Indeed some samples may even contain ""#3 heroin"" (free base smack). At STP only about 25mg of pure smack HCl dissolves in 1mL water, though since IV solutions are usually heated, a higher concentration is probably found in most shots. 


In medical practice IV solutions are usually isotonic, or identical to blood in pH and concentration of electrolytes. This is because hypo or hypertonic solutions will cause fragile blood cells to become damaged and possibly burst. This effect is negligible for single injections, but with a habit it seems possible that this could measurably weaken your body (you likely wouldn't notice it high on smack though). 


Because your blood is so sensitive to pH changes your body has a pH buffer system that absorbs most of the increased acidity/alkalinity. But though the buffer keeps your blood neutral, it becomes weaker with each insult, and likely it's ability to suppress natural changes in pH decreases.  


Interestingly, since merely eating acidic foods causes your bodies' pH to drop (and increases the removal of basic substances) this could mean that this sub's love of SPK could in fact be caused by an unconscious desire to reduce the damage caused by repeated injection of alkaline heroin solutions. 


No I have not tested this, I believe that is what the impressionable masses of the internet are for (but seriously don't try this if you don't know what you're doing....)


Anyway, if you understand this shit well, feel free to correct any errors you believe I've made, the overall value judgment notwithstanding...

first of all... hello everyone. i haven't posted here in fucking forever, and i don't really use this account anymore at all. i use a newer one, which i occasionally post my face on various subs (so obviously avoid commenting here using that one).. so this is my oldest and most anonymous account. i still lurk here on opiates but i've been around and a part of this community for 5-6 years. don't recognize most of the usernames around here these days, but i see old heads pop up every now and again. anyway... what the fuck is up y'all?!!? 

my husband and i have been on subs for two ish years now, but every two-three weeks we treat ourselves to some black tar (IV). we got a new hook a few months ago, which the way that happened is a funny story and could be a post all on its own, but this new guy is basically part of a professional type business of dealers - there's the top dog - the boss - and his various runners, all of whom have different ranks, work different days of the week, have days off, closing and opening times, etc. it's great because we never have to wait more than 5-10 minutes (so far) and he's always got high quality product, never is dry, doesn't fuck us around, and is just all around legit.

so the thing is, this new hook sells white (crack) along with the black. we've both done regular coke before with our shots, so speedballs, but holy fucking tits on christ you guys, a speedball made with crack... is beyond words. it's mind blowing and exhilaratingly pleasurable.. it feels like a cheat code for life - as in, people aren't supposed to or meant to feel this good. so we've gotten both black and white every time we pick up now, with the ratio being about 40/60 white:black so we have the tar to help come down with. 

i hate to say it, because i honestly didn't think it was possible, and heroin is my only other true love besides my husband... but doing a shot now without the white added to it is actually kind of disappointing! it's not near as good as a speedball, it doesn't even compare. like, don't get me wrong, dope on its own is and always will be fucking great. but it seems that i've opened the pandora's box of drugs or pleasurable feelings, and nothing will ever feel that good. not my favorite music on some good lsd or sex on mdma, not cold water when you're dying of thirst, nothing in my imagination could top that feel. 

i'm conflicted on how to feel about this! anyone else experience getting to this point?? 

***edit: tl;dr:*** **heroin has ""lost its magic"" aka isn't as awesome as it used to be and actually kinda disappointing these days since i've started doing speedballs with crack (IV) cuz that is so much more fun and feels so much better than black alone. thoughts?!** ",1490597360.0

Im hoping this will help a few people to have a better understanding of addiction in general Im not a professional  addiction expert or any shit like that lol but Id like to think I got a pretty good grasp of how addiction works. I also believe this part plays a big role in being able to label  addiction as a disease.) --

Ok Im not sure if this is accepted as ""scientifically Proven"" or ""scientific fact"" but when I did my 2 stints in iop along with years of reading and researching on addiction. This is my understanding as to why it happens. When your actively using a drug, doesn't have to be opiates any drug. Though Im sure they all differ slightly its all the same concept... When your ingesting your DOC your brain kinda goes on hiatus. It stops producing seratonin and dopamine through natural stimulus. As its no longer necessary because the drugs are triggering those responses ""remotely"" per se... Hence the reason people feel the need to keep redosing. As tolerance goes up the amount necessary to get ""high"" will also. Eventually reaching a plateu and the high slowly diminishes and you get to where your using just to feel ""normal"" again so to speak. This is where it starts shifting more towards dependence then addiction. Alright stay with me lol. So now after one has been using for enough time  your brains ability to naturally produce seratonin and dopamine have almost seized. So when you stop using drugs and sober up your heads empty for a pretty substantial amount of time leaving you sad depressed and miserable. Until Your brain finally wakes back up and realizes its starving for seratonin and dopamine. So it then goes into crisis mode and it starts over producing like crazy. Causing you to experience overly happy and joyous emotions for a period of time. kinda giving you a false sense that your ok and things are getting better or its gonna be easier. Unfortunately that's not the case. After a while your brain realizes that it has been flooding itself with way too much. So it starts to pull back the reigns again trying to find the right balance. This is where things start getting difficult again. You can  experience  major mood swings. Where your happy and things are great. Then the next thing ya know your depressed as hell and hating life. The only way to truly fix this problem, that I know of is by staying drug and substance free for as long as possible. In a perfect world indefinitely. From my understanding it takes a minimum of a year being substance free before your brain starts sorting shit out and functioning halfway properly. ",1490583249.0

Some topics to start things off:

-Identifying fent and basic harm reduction surrounding it. It's so new and explosive most of us dont know what the hell to do about it. Especially regarding black tar, which is starting to happen.

-Distributing narcan to current users. There's definitely a push to get it out into the community but no one really knows how best to do it.

-Kratom as medically assisted treatment versus methadone or suboxone.

Around 7am I was sitting in the corner and pacing around screaming bloody murder wishing I could die. Flash forward to the hospital, the Dr came in immediately told me he would give me a shot of pain meds which I was whole expecting to be a morphine shot, which I do love. After sitting there and pacing some more I ended up sitting in the corner behind the bed rocking while I cried and screamed. A nurse came in and told me to stop making so much noise I was bothering other patients... I was outraged at that. From the time I was told I was getting that shot til the time I got it it was 45 fucking minutes. You think waiting on a dboy is bad? Nah, this was torture. Finally somebody comes in with my meds and he tells me the Dr wanted me to have dilaudid that you could tell I was clearly in pain and not just seeking attention. Oh hay, cool! Never had it before, and for the first time in my life I finally felt the 'warm blanket covering me' feeling. It took a bit to hit even though it was a shot, which kinda confused me. I don't IV but I assumed it hit you like a ton of bricks. The nurse told me it would take about 20 minutes to fully feel it, fast forward 30 minutes I'm in the lobby waiting on my ride still in massive pain as I nod but so fucking relaxed I kinda kept smiling at my pain, it was just a slight annoyance at that point nothing like the hell I was in beforehand. 

They gave me a script of .5 Norcos. Don't even know if I want to keep them or what. I used to love them but my tolerance is shit. And I do enjoy the high of pills from time to time because to me its different than any street drug high. 

Forgot to mention, why was I in so much pain? 3, yes you read that right fucking 3 exposed nerves in my mouth. Crack is a hell of a drug kiddos. This was all around 8am, its now 3pm and my body still feels like I am on the drug. I came home and went right to sleep which I was so thankful for.

With a brief thought about it, I've decided it must be some modafinil from ages ago so I thought I'm gonna leave it for the morning before work. You know, have a better start. 

Morning. Used some weak opiates, felt OK, drank a bit of tea, and downed 'modafinil'. Then sat down and watched something waiting until all my stuff will kick in and I'll go to my work. 

Well, I've started shivering a bit. Ignored that.

 Then an abnormal pain in my stomach appeared and I started screaming out of it. Literally screaming... 
In next 10 minutes I've decided that my organs must be shutting down and I have some internal bleeding. Now it's either I'm gonna die or call ambulance and lose my life, work etc. Which is nearly the same as dieing to me.

 I felt hopeless but I wasn't in a panic mode to my surprise. I've remembered my 'modafinil'.. 

And I've realised it was damn naltrexone!! 

I've briefly laughed and felt happy. Then I've experienced horrific agony and pain for next 6 hours and after effects for next 24 hours. And even after 3 days I still get mild spasms in my intestines. Precipitated withdrawals aren't the best thing in the world.

I looked up ""Roxie blue jeans"" obviously. Most of the time it's those ads that claim they have every single kind of drug you could be looking for,  that also ask you to Western Union them the money before anything. I hope nobody is actually that dumb  lmao. 

 Anyway, I texted one of the numbers and emailed my number to another person. The one I texted responded sooner who is a little further away, but obviously I wanted to make something happen. The shittiest part is that they charge by the mg,  and I'm used to doing less than that. The other guy also answered who lives in the same city as me but it was a little bit too late. 

 I only bought a couple because one they were expensive as shit, and two I figured I would hear from my dude when he got back into town. But I didn't. So the first one went super smooth, he was a little bit late  client before me was lagging but he was totally upfront with me and let me meet him at a shopping mall so I could do a little shopping lollllll.   But anyways it went super smooth Lee, almost more smoothly than some of my regular people. 

 But, since I only bought a couple and I never heard from my dude I ended up wanting to find a few more. So I ended up texting back the number who is in the same city as me and decided to meet up with them… Mind you I have the worst anxiety, I have been arrested before I am SUPER  sketched out. But I know to kinda  throw them off a little bit in case things start to seem shady once I get there.   Anyways, the second one went great too.   It was super fast, and he gets them out of his own prescription. Both of the dudes were super nice and I was surprisingly able to find two new plugs from fucking craigslist.  They also both offered to let me try them before I bought them,  which I thought was pretty legit.

But anyways so I was a heavy daily IV user of heroin for about 8 years, up until this past December. I moved 1200 miles away to my mothers home to get clean and help out with a few other family related issues. Since I've been down here I've used heroin about 10-15 times and got into meth a little bit, maybe about 30-40 times. But as of the past month or so Ive only been using subs sparingly, as I have other monetary priorities. The past week I haven't done any sub at all. 

So on to what I feel is a major accomplishment in my road to recovery! I'm home alone, getting ready to go to bed in an hr or two, and normally I take some benedryl to help me sleep throughout the night, but I just ran out last night. I know that my Mother had purchased a bottle yesterday so I looked in the kitchen for it but no luck. I glanced into her room to see if it was sitting out on an end table or something, but again no luck! However I did happen to notice a pill bottle with a mixture of different pills in it. I opened it up and it was full of melatonin tablets and about 8 round pills, I took a closer look and they were 10mg methadone pills. I know she has a script of them because shes given me some in the past when I was really dope sick (such a great momma bear!)

But I actually had enough self control to put them back and not take a single one. I know this may sound silly to even some of yall other users, but this like a HUGE accomplishment in my book. I've never walked away from free opiates before ever, regardless of who's they were. I know I may come off as scumbagish for saying that but I'm not ashamed to admit that I had horrible, horrible self control in the past. Sorry if this is shit post tier but I just feel really proud of myself for not being the normal scumbag I've been for the past almost decade..

Question for the lot of you IV users. My go-to syringes are 30g 1/2"" (12.7mm) 1cc insulin, preferably EasyTouch brand but brand isn't that important.

However today she held up the bag and after a super quick glance that looked fine I paid for them assuming she grabbed the bag I was asking for (this is at the pharmacy counter). Problem is, I get home and realize it says ""SHORT NEEDLE"" on the bag beside the length section (after opening the pack so can't return now). They weren't 1/2"" (12.7mm) but they are **5/16"" (8mm)** spikes and I've never used these kind before man they are ***short as fuck!***

So my question - what is your preferred spike length? Have any of you ever used (and/or use regularly) 5/16"" (8mm) spikes and if so, any tips for someone who usually uses the 1/2""? They just look so small I'm concerned about getting registered and then when I go to move ever so slightly to pull back and/or hit the shot that my fucking needle will fall out or something lol.

Thanks fam for the pointers!

Mayyybe a little hard time sleeping for a week or so but I think some of that is just jet lag anyway. But being under water and breathing compressed gas like that makes you tired as fuck so after a few dives a day you sleep like a baby. Diving also makes you really hungry and thirsty. My last dive job was on a yacht that I lived on and I would eat 5 meals a day. I felt so fucking healthy. Plus, just getting all that sunshine on your body and that little bit of exercise probably helps along with being in some cold water that really forces your system to just flush itself out.

Started sub yesterday. Today I feel fine physically just hungry from not eating, but really mentally spaced out. When do you all think it'll get better?

I now have a steady source of subs and when adjusted feel great at around 4mg a day. The first couple days are always a blur - figures - so this is probably normal and I just don't realize it. Right now I'm a ball of apathy and feeling very dissociative. Sure my bpd prob doesn't help much. and that gives me extreme anxiety. I'm assuming that since today I'm physically okay for the most part I should adjust soon like I have before.... right? I fucked up and missed work due to crippling anxiety attacks. Even considered copping although would be an absolute waste. I know that between my pain and how much of a total opiate fiend I've become, I may not ever be *fully* clean. Sub maintenance is frowned upon by some, i will lose everything and/or die without something like this. 

Think I'll be ok soon? How does everyone else feel adjusting onto subs?

Love y'all. Praying for a better tomorrow. ",1490636375.0

I want to get clean but I have a very low motivation to as well as being quite depressed overall, and not in shape. I feel like in my current condition there is no hope for me quitting as I have no energy or dopamine running through my brain whatsoever without oxy in me and I will fall apart fast. I am wondering if getting myself physically in shape first will give me something to be proud of as well as raise my energy level, providing more motivation to quit and better health to handle the battle, kind of priming myself for it.


  Do you think i'm wasting my time though? Can I actually put on muscle and get in legitimately good shape without getting sober or will it be an uphill battle? I am talking about actual physical problems more than mental motivation, I don't know if the opiates will physically hinder my ability to get stronger. Anyone else manage to pull something like this off while addicted?

  The problem with my long term addiction is not tolerance for me, it's frequency, over the last two years my time between withdrawls has been shrinking more and more. I find it quite strange that I could get to that point, but maintain my tolerance and actually lower it by almost 50% over a year, but during that time feel withdrawls faster and faster, I always thought the two aspects were parallels and moved with one another.

I've been taking suboxone for opiate maintenance for a few weeks now and I just kinda have that feeling I just want one night to chill out again.

I take 1- 8mg subs each day. Don't know if it's true but I heard fent can basically be felt over Subs.

I'm thinking one day I take my 8mg sub in the morning, then 8 hours (maybe less? ) I should be able to get something out of the fent. Then a night goes by. Out of fent.  I return back to subs as my social break is over, should I wait 36hours or 32?28?12? (I know fent has really short action and half life. ) Before redoing subs? Or when I'm in mega wds?

Undoubtedly the best dope I've done all year, hands down (and arguably the best ever)

Definitely fent as it draws up clear as water in the rig, but somehow it feels different from DNM fent (and I've done a wide variety of the mainstream fentanyl derivatives, including, but not limited to, acetylfent, butryfent, furanylfent, and 4fibf: U4 too, though that isn't an analogue)
And they all pale in comparison to this stuff in terms of euphoria and overall enjoyability. My  guy usually consistently has fire, but this is definitely the best shit he's had. Approximately 20mg (eyeballed) had me sucking my own dick for 3 and a half hours. IV'd, it gave me pins and needles and a rush reminiscent of my very first experience using heroin. Absolutely blown away. Wish I had the equipment necessary to test this gift from the heavens.

This happened back in late January, I was at my house sleeping in after spending the night getting rocked with a girl I had met not long before when I get woken up by my phone ringing non fucking stop, I answer it and it's my buddy Cody asking for a ride. He said he needed a ride to burn someone, I wont fuck anyone who doesn't deserve it and Cody knows this so he said it was the same guy who a month prior fucked me on $200.

I wake up the girl who stayed with me and we set out to go pick up Cody and another buddy Robert down at his house and head off to get a little revenge. I parked my car on the street below the gas station Cody was to meet dude at and waited there while he went to do his thing. After maybe 10 minutes Cody jumped in the car and told me to hurry that the guy was chasing him so I took off on back roads out of town and to my home girls house to pick up a couple buns. On our way back to town Cody insists on taking back roads and starts acting sketchy but that's not all that weird for Cody so I just do as asked, at this time I thought it was gunna be a pretty good day. That's when my phone rings, it's my child's mother telling me to be careful coming back into town because there were cops everywhere, I live in a very small town so anymore than the town cop is cause for concern so I asked if she knew what was going on and that's when she informed my someone had robbed the gas station. At this time we were already back at Roberts house so I got off the phone with her and flipped the fuck out on Cody.

While trying to decide what to do about the situation I get a text from my dad saying I needed to call the state police barracks followed by a second text this time it was a picture of 6 or 7 cop cars parked around the front of my house.

While on the phone with the cops I hear a commotion on the porch and realize my child's mother (Robert's sister) is arguing with the police so I quickly hand my shit to the girl who had stayed with me the night before and instructed her to hide everything while I kept the cops outside.

Everyone in the car ended up getting arrested and taken to the barracks to be questioned. Cody and the girl went to jail, Cody for the obvious and the girl because of warrants.

Apparently Robert and Cody willingly told the cops that after leaving town we went to a drug dealer that only I was able to meet and used the money Cody stole to get high, the cop then asked me what I wanted to tell him about ""DRUG DEALERS NAME!"" I couldn't fucking believe those fucking cock suckers openly told the cops where we got the shit, I replied saying ""I'd like to tell you that she's one of my oldest and very best friends and we always look out for each other,"" which pretty much told them all they were gunna get me to say.

Cody is fucked when I see him again, I knew he was an idiot but I never thought he'd rob a gas station that he lived right next to. I've found out since then Robert and another kid knew about it before it happened so Robert's fucked too but he doesn't know it yet. Names are changed

So, i've been on codeine/paracetamol for a good 3 years, sort of on and off, but since my sciatic pain has increased over the past few months, ive been taking it more frequently (but not overdosing as in, taking more then prescribed, its 6-8 a day, i sometimes take up to 10.

I do take breaks between lots of painkillers, maybe 2-3 days, and i don't have any withdrawal symptoms as far as i know, apart from some sleep problems, which is sometimes from the backpain waking me up.

What are the symptoms? and how soon does it happen? in my case, with my dosages, will withdrawals be common (each pill = 30mg codeine, 500mg paracetamol).

I don't want to talk to a doctor about this because it's the only thing thats helping with the pain, i've tried other drugs like lyrica and stuff, and they had shitty side effects... and well, ibuprofen, not gonna touch that.

I do try to regulate my usage of codeine, i know its addictive, im scared of being addicted, so, that's why i came here...

I hope i can get atleast a little bit of answers here.

To try and make a really long story shorter, I've been caring for my uncle who is completely bedridden with multiple sclerosis. For the past three years, I made the 40 minute drive from my  apartment to his house to be with him and take care of him all day, for free and on my own time, Monday through Friday.

 Well, I knew his end would come eventually, and sooner than we would both like, but he died rather suddenly 10 days ago. For so long, I took care of business. I took care of the house, the bills, the shopping, the cleaning, the cooking, and my uncle-in every way imaginable. The only thing he was able to control was his voice and his right thumb. My uncle was my friend, my therapist, my father figure...for those last three years, he was my world. 

Besides my wonderful fiance, my uncle was the only one I could be completely honest with about my opiate addiction. He wanted me to be clean and happy so badly. This was a guy who (being bedridden, unable to move, and in constant pain) was so fucking generous that he would offer me his last morphine or fentanyl patch and happily go without his meds if it meant ME not being dope sick. My junkie ass didn't even HAVE to steal from him, he would have sacrificed everything for me anyway. That's just the kind of guy he was. 

I don't know where I'm going with this, it hurts to even type this out. I feel so empty and lost, and on top of that I'll be out of drugs tomorrow, as my only supplier was my uncle. 

Getting into fentanyl these past couple years has given me an astronomical tolerance. I was doing about 350mcg of fent in about 2-3 days. I really fucked myself here guys. I don't know what I'm hoping for or asking for with this post, I guess I'm just fucking terrified. I have about 100mgs of methadone I acquired and a seemingly endless supply of gabapentin. I know I can do this if I have to, but I'm not ready. I'm terrified of losing the numbness of drugs because I already feel destroyed by the loss of my uncle, and I know it's only going to get worse when I start really feeling again.

Then they have us pull the usual fucking drive them to cop and all their usual bullshit that comes with that after explicitly telling them we cannot drive anywhere and aren't coming if they need a ride ANYWHERE.

Once I got home I pulled out mine and realized they were just plain white tablets, same exact size and shape of the ones we get, with NO imprint or scoring. Knew I was beat then and there even tho they swear up and down that they are ""generics."" I know that no pill in the US, even OTC, comes without imprints.

I had one of those horrible pick up stories.... only things that happen to opiate addicts because we sometimes... prolly deserve it.  

So to give a small backview... I've been using opiates for About 6 years.  Was mainly just an obnoxious amount of norcos for the last 5 years- but just did the faithful switch to H bout 3 months ago.   New Years Eve to be exact.  Sweet New Years resolution you idiot.  My boyfriend and I use together - basically started right after we began dating as a weekend thing - and it's basically been the third person in this relationship since then.  K - that's done.  

We were POSITIVE our tax refund was gonna hit yesterday.... so we spent all our money - and did our last lines of dope around 1pm.   Did the faithful .... trying to go about our day without staring at our phones for that deposit alert.  But let's be honest - we're addicts and we loyally obsessed about it all day - willing it into existence. Googling dumb shit like ""what time of day exactly will the IRS deposit my refund into my Netspend"", scouring over refund schedules. Today was gonna be the day!!! it should be in there any minute!!   

Couple hours in we're both sweating that nasty sweat - only us opiate lovers understand.  Feeling like 200 degrees on the inside.... fucking freezing on every inch of our skin.  How the fuck can I be so hot and so cold at the exact same time?!  This shit is gross.  We're not even smart addicts.  We don't know how to keep ourselves well - so it seems like we spend 50% of our time sick.  Why haven't we figured out that magical formula?? After all -  we should be really good at withdrawal considering how much time we spend doin just that - withdrawing.  Ugh.  Who cares if all the bills are late and there's no food in the fridge and chores need done.  None of that matters at this particular moment.  There's only one thing that matters and that is getting this feeling to go away....  NOW. 

So we go to bed early -8ish.   Because nothing else sounds doable.  By bed I mean simultaneously flipping around in bed - trying to get comfortable - trying not to be hot.  Trying not to be cold.  FUCKKKKK.   How am I going to go to work again tomorrow - dragging ass and not doing anything productive.  Have they noticed how bad my production has gone down?? Have they noticed how much I call in?  Why can't I stop?!?

So - I'l not remind everyone how slow each minute went.  After 72 hours... oh wait - I mean 6 hours - it's 1am and we scheme up a way to make a trip.  One of his friends has 20 bucks and no car.  He will buy us ALL THREE one bag.  One little tiny bag (maybe .2? .1?).  Let's be honest - I don't really know.   I just know what that beautiful tiny little black bag looks like.  

We live about 20 minutes away from downtown - I generally don't go on the drives.   I have the timing down to a science considering I spend my time staring at the clock, waiting for him to return.  20 minutes there.  Usually bout a 20 minute wait.  20 minute drive home.   Let the 60 minute countdown start. 

It's 1 AM.  

He leaves...  I flip thru reddit - between opiates and opiatesrecovery:... because a girl can dream amiright????  Trying to make he time go by and not obsessively text him ""where ya at???""  ""How much longer???""  ""Can you tell me in minutes!?!?!?""

So I get a phone call bout 33 minutes it.  This can't be good.  He never calls.  They got pulled over.  Just for being down there I guess - wrong street.  Wrong time.  It is so obvious what These two skinny white kids are doing at this hour.  Two cops - each show up at a window.  But wouldn't you have it - they ended up being cool.   Never got to the part about iDS, insurance, registration.  Asked some general questions - basically told these two to go home.  Made a few comments about ""tryin to pick up some weeeeeeed??"".  But they let them go. 

So he tells me.... add a little time to your clock.  Oh and we're at 0 miles to empty.  That doesn't REALLY mean 0 miles right????? 1:30ish and they""re finally headed to the dboy.

So by 2am I'm texting - asking him to shoot me a text when he leaves.  It takes a while - he calls me bout 2:15 - he's headed back. ""I need gas - but:. Ahhh fuck it - we can make it home.  Jumps on the freeway -  and not even a minute later....
FUCK.  We just ran out of gas."" It's 2 in the morning.  They only have 3 dollars between the two of them.  He hangs up on my and tries to figure out a plan.  Calls everyone we know semi-close.  Nobody answers.  Why would they?  They apparently attempted to push the car back?? Sounds dumb.  Walk to a gas station at the nearest exit.  

I'm at home - pissed I'm not gonna get my dope anytime soon.  Ugh.

Gas station man is no help.  No gas can we can borrow lol.  No... they cannot put gas in water bottles and try to transfer it that way.

More dumb shit.

Realizes we have roadside assistance about 3:30ish.  Calls them -  they will be there about 3:42.

I'm subtracting.. adding....multiplying.....trying to figure out WHENS IT GONNA BE HERE?'

Texts me and tells me during this whole fiasco they dropped the bag.  Yup.  The small, pathetic little 1/3 of a bag is gone.  I'm convinced they prolly did it and cut me out. ......Just misery.

gets home around 4:26 with nothing for me.  
That sweet sweet sweet relief is never coming. 

Lay there in my sweat- don't sleep for one minute and then hear my alarm go off.  Gotta get up and start my day.  I don't even want to imagine how horrible it will be.

The end.

Inspiration post: https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/61wjkr/kinda_just_wanna_brag_for_a_minute_sorry/ 

So I finally got on a Subutex script at the beginning of this year after a year of heavy heroin use. It was difficult at first to fill the hole that getting high on heroin left behind but the thought of not being able to get high due to my script helped re-wire my brain.

It's been 11 weeks to the day since I last used (and when I first started on my script) and I can finally stand to be around heroin without fiending again! Granted I'm replacing heroin with *off-n-on* Xanax and cocaine use but heroin is the last thing on my mind!

I realised all of this 3 days ago when I helped my best friend (who uses heroin very sparingly) move his old bed into my other best mate's house. After it was all said and done he asked me if I would mind scoring a couple bags for him (his Mrs just miscarried) and I said ""No worries mate"" like all good friends do.

Anyway I scored the bags and we went back to his to chill out for a bit. I was on about 3mg of Xanax and we had split a £50 bag of cocaine. Just as we got back he asked again if it was ""...okay to smoke up around you..."" to which I replied ""Of course! If I didn't feel comfortable I wouldnt have scored for you in the first place!""

We proceeded to watch a film while he was smoking away happily and the whole time the only thought that went through my mind was ""Sucks I can't enjoy myself that way anymore!"" Crazy right?

Anyway I just thought I would share my success story with you guys because, fuck, you all kept me sane throughout my kicking of heroin - as did my best mate which is why it didn't bother me that he was using in front of me.

If you made it this far thank you for reading and thank you for being there for me albeit indirect or otherwise. Take solace in your friends, family or even this community coz it really does help; well it did for me anyway!",1490717802.0

This stuff grows wild everywhere near me so I plan to try it out this summer. I tried to submit the link but it wouldn't post so had to copy and paste.,"Wild Lettuce (Photo Source)

The reason it’s referred to as opium lettuce, is due to the pain relieving and sedative effects that it has been known to produce through a white substance found in the stem and leaves.

This milky substance is called lactucarium. And, while it doesn’t contain any opiates, it has similar side effects when used –  it acts directly on the central nervous system (CNS) to lessen the feeling of pain, just like morphine. 

Lactuca Virosa is the scientific term for it, and many people have used it in place of addictive prescription pain medicine. It’s a leafy and tall plant, with small yellow buds, and could be grown right out your door. Morecommonly found in North America and England, it’s a cousin to the lettuce we typically see at the grocery store. It’s also referred to as bitter lettuce, or more appropriately for the purpose discussed here, opium lettuce.

Even though it seems to be the best kept secret, it has a history of being used as an alternative to pain relief.

Historical Use

Back in the 19th century, wild lettuce was already being used by some as a substitute to opium. But, it was in the 70’s that it started to gain significant popularity by those wanting a more natural remedy. Individuals were starting to use it for both pain relief, as well as recreational purpose.

In the earlier days, people using wild lettuce prepared it a couple different ways. One way was to cook the plant in a pan of water and sugar mix, until it reduced to a thick syrup-like consistency. While this was an effective form, it was quite bitter even with the sugar added. The most common form however, was drying the stem and leaves to use as an herbal tea.

The tea remains popular today. But, it’s also being dried for smoking, or vaporizing. If you don’t care to grow it yourself, it can also be purchased as a dried herb, extract, or resin substance.

My D'boy is a godsend. Big, solid 3 gram rock for 125 bucks, and it's grade A gear for sure. Delicious dope, as I described before in my last dopeporn post.

Just curious. Fentanyl is commonplace down here, but this stuff is in a category of it's own. Starting to suspect it's (heavily diluted) carfent, as someone in my last post pertaining to this gear theorized.
As I stated, I've done a vast array of DNM fentanyl derivatives and nothing compares to this shit. Though I have no clue how carfent would end up in a dopehouse in the ""hood"".

I have a pretty heavy past of using and then ending up in rehab, staying clean for a year or more then ending up shooting dope and ending up in rehab on suboxone again.

America has a huge culture surrounding opioids, and since getting suboxone script seems to be much easier than gettin a PM script (or smuggling dope across an ocean / two national borders).

About 3 and a half hours ago I took a 30mg Adderall. Helped me get focused, wake up, etc. But now I'm shaky/jittery/etc and my anxiety is pretty high.

I have three 2mg bars, plus a 3/4th of one. My tolerance is usually 1mg, but it's a bit higher now as I've been taking 1mg for the past few nights. Usually I like to keep them for nights, so I can enjoy the buzz, but I was thinking I should probably try to take the edge off this anxiety-- I just don't want to ruin the buzz for later since the Xanax half life is so long and if I were to take, say, .5 or 1mg now (it's almost 9am here) and then try around 6pm to take maybe 1.5 mg, it won't feel like I've taken much or any at all. If that makes any sense.

And yeah, really I need to be taking it for when my anxiety starts up and not just for the buzz-- but, with my PTSD, I'm always on edge whether my anxiety is bad or not. Sometimes it's just nice to take it for the buzz and for the chance to dull down the constant fight or flight response, yunno?

When you do your heroin/opiates do you find that you like to lay down, chill, relax or do you find yourself more active? 


I've been shooting heroin for close to thirteen years now and I always find myself being way more active... I start cleaning, cooking, talking with people. I don't know if it's the confidence that I get from it - I'm definitely sure that it's not cut with any kind of upper or what have you since my Methadone Clinic has a precise drug testing screen and heroin (well... morphine is the only thing that shows up). 

There are the rare times that I get too fucked up and start nodding but even then my mindset is on doing something active
- unfortunately it never works out as when I stand up, I nod off and wake up in the same position like four hours later when my high is already about to end. 

I've seen people who take the same batch as me - began non stop talking as if they just took speed and then others just like to sit or lay down and watch Television just relaxing. 

I don't know for me to lay down and just lay there doing nothing is like a waste of a high? But I guess to each his own...

Maybe you have a certain activity that you always do when high? I like writing a lot or looking at articles especially involving history and making notes on things I find interesting... I know it's weird but I don't have friends and I just enjoy doing that - high.

So how about you guys and girls? ",1490846614.0

I was a VERY heavy use of 10mg Lortabs for a couple of years and I was so dumb that I had no clue I was addicted. Once I realized what I was doing to myself I asked my counselor and she suggested this drug called Suboxone. She gave me a number for a doctor friend of hers that would prescribe it to me. 

Fast forward a few weeks and I am just plumb out of drugs and this was my first experience with W/D's and it hit me like a fucking jackhammer. I was NOT prepared for this experience. 

I was in full W/D's for several hours when I decided to call the doctor. I didn't have much faith because it was a Friday evening about 6:00 PM, but he answered and I told him how I got his number. 

He did a exam over the phone and called in a script for me for several of those 8mg pills that you put under your tongue that taste like orange shittyness. He asked me what felt like 40832 questions about how I was feeling and now that I think about it, he was just making sure I was in full withdrawal. Anyway, I go to the pharmacy and pick up the pills and took one right there in the car. Literally, 5 minutes later I was totally fine. No symptoms whatsoever anymore. I felt like a million bucks. 

I stayed on for about 3 days and felt fine after that. 

Fast forward a few years when I am neck deep into another opiate addiction and I am ready to jump, I get on Subs again. However, this time I stay on them for almost a year! The doc I was seeing was of the mindset that it was OK to be on them forever as long as you were not taking pain pills. 

After about a year I decided that I needed to get off the subs and it was fucking hell!!! OMG, I would rather jump off Oxy again than go through that. I seriously feel like it was easier to get off pills rather than subs. 

What are some of your experiences with Suboxone? Do you think people should just be on it forever? When you jumped, was it harder than other times?",1490845581.0

I have been in almost constant agony and practically bed ridden for about 3 months.

My doctor has refused to prescribe anything for the pain, other than muscle relaxers and Gabapentin for the nerve pain.

Even if she did, Hydrocodone or Oxycodone are going to do nothing for me as I have a bit of a tolerance. Last year I was going hardcore using everyday all day. Since last May, I have cut way back. A few times a month I will pick up .3 and use it over that evening and have a little for breakfast. 

I am so scared of how its going to be after I have the procedure. I have never once asked the doctor for anything for the pain, but I do try to stress to her the significant impact it has had on my life. 

I guess i'm asking for advice from this community. Maybe someone has been through something similar. I have been dealing with the most excruciating days, some that I just wished for death all day. And i'm sure I'm going to have a few more coming my way after the surgery. I truly don't know if I can handle it much longer, and I don't know what to do about it. ",1490828921.0

so after a few weeks of lagging, i finally went and saw a sub dr this week. my plan is to do the last of my dope today and start taking the subs tomorrow so i have most of the weekend to adjust. 

i'm just wondering if theres anything i can do to make the 24 hour wait before i can take the 1st sub any easier. 

i don't have access to benzos unfortunately, is there anything else otc that will make my time less shitty and also not cause precip wd?

also i have access to kratom, but i havent been able to find out if taking kratom before subs causes pwd. all the posts i saw were asking if it was possible to get high off kratom after already taking subs. anyone have experience with this?

i know you guys(and gals) all hate these kind of posts but i don't really know where else to ask (everyone in /r/kratom seems to think that subs are the devil and kratom is just as effective at killing wds, which is bullshit if you have an actual habit to kick) 

any advice is appreciated.

62kjec,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/62kjec/small_victories_day_three/,22,https://redd.it/62kjec,ilovedrugs666,small victories (day three),"let me preface this with a couple of things; i like writing during this time because i have never gone through this alone before. and although many of you have, (i admire your strength and willpower) it scared me because i was terrified i would give in to the cravings. just like every other time. i figured even if only a couple people here responded, it would help to just be totally honest with the people here.

day 3

today i had to drive to the nearest city (where i always copped from); to retrieve my wallet from a woman who found it on a bus. i was a few hours away from reaching 36 hours aka day 3 of my umpteenth attempt to kick my dope habit. i had $10 in my pocket. enough for a pack of smokes. enough for two more blues and a nick of good weed to help carry me through the last of withdrawals. enough for a bag of good dope. 

long story short, a couple days ago, i accidentally left my wallet on a gas station convenience store counter. no less than 30 seconds out the door i realized what i had done but the wallet was gone that fast. cashier was a dick and no help- nor were there any customers besides the guy behind me in line (99% sure he was the wallet napper) who i barely got a glimpse of on my way out. so i gave up on ever seeing my wallet again and returned home to do my last bag of dope. jokes on the dude that swiped my wallet because it contained absolutely no money of any kind, nor cards (no bank account so therefore no debit or credit cards, gift certificates, etc.) 

At this point, all i'm thinking about is getting my wallet back because it has my license in it. for once i was glad that I''m super poor so the thief tossed in on the bus where the minister lady found it. she called and wanted to meet in an area where i could find dope in a mile in every directon. Luckily she was sweet and already waiting outside when I pulled up. She gave me my wallet and I thanked her profusely. 

With my wallet and all it entails back in my possession, I decide to grab some extra things for my wd kit since I'm working tomorrow. The old me would have copped dope even before I picked up the wallet. But it was different this time. I haven't thought about using once. I haven't had a craving once. I have always given in but this time I can tell something is different. I want this more than anything and i will not give up so easily this time. Something about my mindset is different this time but i can't pinpoint it. every day that I don't use is a miracle.

You may have dumped me. But I'm done numbing the pain and my reality.

Why the fuck am I awake at 3:36AM?? Why? It's certainly not because I'm streaming Night Vale, unfortunately. And it's also not because I am work-less tomorrow either - nothing could be further from the truth. So what the fuck.

You know it. I know it. We all know why. Because I [got some fire](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/62bokk/fucking_landedgypsy/), which I'll admit a good portion of my being and psyche are somewhat regretful about. 

However, the rest of me is shit-bang high as a mother fucker. Not one word, 'motherfucker', because that's how goddamned high I am. Mother. Fucking. High. Kites ain't got nothing on me.

And what's one of the symptoms of my opioid intoxication, dear listeners? That's right. It's goddamned insomnia. As spoken many times before, I am not a typical nod user. I actually get pretty fucking wired amped juiced unless I do a good quantity more than I actually need to get high. 

The bumps at 5:30PM were probably *not* inadvisable. I do fear, however, that the same could not have been said for the bump later on at dinner, oh maybe three hours later. That, my noddy audience, may have been a tragic mistake within the context of my retiring for the evening.

I have to ask, if you do not begin your title with a solicitation for votes, but instead end it as so... is it still a [violation of intergalactic law](http://i.imgur.com/FgAA5bJ.png)? 

In any case, my sweet fellatophilic and cunnilinguistic playmates, I desperately need to sleep. Tomorrow will most certainly ~~more~~ be quite challenging, much more so than the average weekday tends to be.

So, I opted for the most obvious and opiate-appropriate resolution that I could comds(*come*) aack(*back*)dddddddddddddddddddddd to.

Just took 14mg Dilaudid and I'm [mostly] opiate naive... will I be OK?,"So I think I may have overdone it out of impatience because opiates and opioids have worked on and off for me in the past (usually ""off""). Maybe I had too much hubris. Anyway:

In the past, I've taken grams upon grams of kratom over an hourlong period with little noticeable effect, and have taken up to 40mg oxycodone up the ass and nose over the course of a night and woken up fine. (I take Seroquel 100mg ER at night as well, just for the record.)

I only use opiates about once every 2 or 3 weeks, so I consider myself ""opiate naive"". Even then, I feel like the effects are subtle at best. It makes me wonder if it's at all possible that some people are genetically predisposed to feel the effects of certain drugs, opiates included, less or more.

Anyhow:

I started tonight by snorting 4 mg Dilaudid, feeling kind of good, but in a subtle way, though that wasn't good enough, and then snorted 6 mg more. I felt pretty good but I wanted just a bit more of a kick, so I plugged 4 mg about five minutes ago.

I realized at this point, being distracted by a video game, that I didn't really look up dose charts and whatnot, and am probably playing with fire.

Anyway, so as not to ramble on, my point it this: Have I basically OD'd? Will I be OK? Should I, like, call poison control?

I'm looking up Dilaudid dosages right now and can barely find anything on it.

So yeah. I know I just did something probably foolish out of hubris, impatience, and naivety... but if someone could give me a quick reply on whether or not I overdid it with the dose, I'd appreciate it.

I don't mean child molesters or pedophiles that physically abuse victims, I mean viewers of child pornography and people who are sexually attracted to children. In either case, addicts and pedophiles are likely ashamed of their actions, but continue to do so because they can't help themselves (or choose not to). It is something you are born with, and they are not victimless habits (a child was abused for you to receive child pornography, and people were likely killed at some point by the originating source of your drugs). I think many people view addiction as a public health issue instead of a criminal issue simply because most Americans have been affected by addiction, either personally or through a loved one.

I could tell they were thinking like ""the fuck this white boy want."" Lol. Asked if they knew where I could get well. Chick was like ""you mean heroin?!"" I said ""hell yeah."" She hopped in the whip and 2 minutes later, we at the spot and I got 0.3 of some fiyah tar for $20. Broke her off a little bag to say thanks, got her number, and ran home. Easy AF.

I'm currently clean for a little over a month, but it hasnt been as hard as it would normally be due to a fent OD scaring me shitless.
That being said when it comes to opiates we dont scare long unfortunatly and Im finding myself really wanting relief again.
I have extensive injuries from a really bad motorcycle wreck and it wears on me everyday.
Ive tried Kratom but the only thing it helps with is mood really, although I do have bad depression and anxiety with some PTSD and suspected bipolar as well so kratom is probably second to opiates. I dont like drinking very much as it takes like half a 5th to do much for me and I dont enjoy the taste or being drunk much. 
I dont like smoking and it also makes pain worse. Weed is ok, but not what I was hoping it would be. 
The jury is still out though as I havent smoked very much of it really.
Heroin is just so risky and so dangerous and so expensive its not even feasible at all. But that doesnt stop me wanting it. The longest Ive gone since I started it was 3 months with lots of other few week breaks where Ive caved after. How does one function after this sort of thing?
Anyway I think thats enough from me, thanks for any advice you can give.. and stay safe.",1490922611.0

I'm actually writing it here, because I don't have anyone to tell this story to.   
I had this guy I was bying pills from, long time ago, before heroin. We were drinkin, smoking weed and taking pills together, until one of us (usually me) had to go home, he was also selling all the pills and the weed obviously. We had really good time together, and we remained friends after I swiched to heroin and didn't have a business contact with him anymore. The problem is, that he had a really dark thinking about the world, his position in it, and himself as well. He wasn't just depressed. He totally lost any will to continue his life. He often was talking about killing himself - or someone on the street. He was all against people and society. But these periods came and passed, and time to time he seemed ok. I quickly realised i can't help him. When he was talking these kind of things to me the first time, and then again on fb, i tried to talk to him, but he reacted so angry and so sure about his truth - not leaving me to finish a sentence - that i decided not to poison my own wellbeing, and took a step back. I knew, he doesn't have much friends, or any contact with his family, but i never thought how much he is detached from reality. I think all the meds he was taking didn't help.  
So last week i borrowed some money from him, and that i am going to give it back to him this week, but this monday he started to write all the crapy things again. I was half in withdrawal and didn't have my patience, and started to reply about how he should maybe start over everything. I shouldnt have done that. We ended up in a huge fight on the phone, and he named me everything, from a piece of junkie shit that tries to give him a lecture of life, to his personal enemy, that takes him down, when he has a bad day (seriously, all i was saying, that maybe he should leave the house, and try out some new things in life). It kinda continued the next day, but i wasn't replying, so after a while he came down, and was speaking normally again, like ""lets forget this, it was all stupid"" etc. We even talked with a totally normal voice about me coming to him and giving back his money, as I promised.  
So today came, and I tried to call him, text him, but he didn't reply. I was like, ok, he is sleeping, or whatever. I took a tour in the city, was scrolling down on fb news, when news about a shooting in his street came up. You could even see his house on the picture.   
I immediatly knew it was him. Apparently he was arguing with 3 other guys down the street, pulled out his (gas) gun, and shot (with rubber bullets I think, but not sure(they can still harm people badly)) a couple of times. The cops got him, and he is probably somewhere in jail now.   
I'm shocked. I knew he was capable of a lot of things, but never in my life I imagined seeing him as the leading news in my city. Also I feel like I did something wrong, or not enough, or I don't know. I should have told someone about his condition, or not acting like that on monday, or leave him years ago, when I already knew I can't help him.   
Sorry for the long story, but I had to write it down somewhere, and this seemed the place.

But not this time. This time is different.

I don't want to pretend that it's all mental either. I do have a couple sub strips, a few xanax, some weed for the nausea, and benedryl for the watery eyes and runny nose. The combination works wonders. I can't even tell I'm going through withdrawal. I'm lucky that I don't have to go through this cold turkey like other times. 

This time is different. For the first time, I actually want this. 

I know the battle isn't over. I know a long, difficult road lies ahead. 2 days might not seem like much, but to me it's amazing. every single day I don't do dope is a miracle to me. Getting high and avoiding my emotions became as natural as breathing and I questioned my ability to stop for good.

And guess what? I still might fuck up. Because that's the nature of the beast. But I have goals and dreams and I believe that one day I truly will be able to say I haven't done dope in years. I will make it to day three. I will prove to myself that there is more to me than a weak, shitty, escape artist who uses heroin to avoid everything and everyone.

Continuing off my general excitement of having a car finally after not having one for months. Once we finally got the car and able to get away from my brother we started off calling all of our dudes like, let's blow this money right meow! We were so excited we tried all of our back up dudes like fuck yeah we can finally go where we haven't in so long. Nobody would fucking answer so we called our main dude, he is fucking awesome real stand up dude but his shit is subpar. But whatever, we finally got a car to fucking cop! 

He told us to go to the worst spot in all of town. We have a bigger gas station smack in the hood that people literally stand outside and sling shit 24/7, like drug selling before cell phones and technology. It's cop central, and we're white in this bitch sticking out like a sore thumb. I dropped my boyfriend off at the door and pulled up to the pump in an attempt to blend in. We hadn't been there long when it all started, the scene setting up the moments to later play out. A cop was chilling in the lot, I got my phone out texting dude trying to warn him but no he is fucking calling telling me he is there. I'm all like stop wait there is a cop so he tells me to pull out go right, and another right. Y'all know fucking typical dealer directions. But as I pull up to the exit to make my first right I notice the cop is chilling at the other exit just kinda watching me. I had this vibe this feeling ya know. I told my dude what's happening, he's on the phone the whole time and I take a left instead to lure the cops away knowing he is merely cars from me. He thanks me for thinking smart on my feet and looking out like that. 

Pull out the parking lot onto this side street making my way to the main road, that's when I'm sure I'm being followed and watched the cop slowly eases out after me. Shit. Fuck. I get on the main road just as she flips her lights one. The one rule was do not get pulled over in this car, and I broke it within an hour. Wtf my luck. She comes up to the window and turns out to be a nice cop, wanted my license wanted to know why I'm in such a bad area and why. I fed her some story about how I'm borrowing this car and just joyriding and enjoying the vibes of driving. She smiles and accepts that answer that it was in fact that, that we were doing as well as just stopping for smokes. She took both of our licenses and noted I was shaking a little and wanted to know why. I joked about how isn't that her job, like to make me feel a little scared at least? She laughed, you could tell she appreciated that I was basically an easy traffic stop. She goes back to her car to run our licenses. Other than traffic violations we are both squeaky clean. 

But wait, fuck. I have an unpaid ticket from several years ago. Shit. I've been to jail over that exact issue. A simple traffic stop and bam I'm in jail. I start freaking like do I have a warrant over that? Well at least we got the money to get me out, I guess. But not the fucking car. Ugh. Why is she taking so long to run our names? Has my car been running this whole time? Let me turn that off. Why am I so worried about turning off the lights I'll just keep letting them beep. Fuck. She is still back there? What is that bright ass fucking light to my left? Cops! Two fucking cops with lights shinning them in brightly trying to see if we got drugs, if we're trying to buy. They know, they aren't stop. Dealers and buyers think nobody notices. I see you piece of shit car pulling in, and leaving after that car rides up to you. 

She still isn't back. Fuck, yeah I'm going to jail. Why does it look like there are more cop lights in my mirrors? Wait, there is one, two, three, fou... hold on he just busted a u turn to come back to this scene of cops. She isn't back yet and my car is starting to be surrounded. Yeah, I'm going to jail. Will they want me to snitch on my dealer? Do I have it in me to do that? Oh wait, here she comes finally. I ask if she minds if I turn off my lights the beeping was driving me nuts. She told me I can turn my car back on actually. DID SHE JUST SAY THAT?! OH GOD I KNOW I'M SAFE, NO JAIL FOR ME. She didn't even ask for my insurance, which I don't have yet. So win win. She asked me if I knew were I was driving to and I said just around enjoying the night still, she told me to be safe and have a good night. 

HOLY FUCKING SHIT, DID THAT JUST HAPPEN?! Let me just keep driving straight trying to get away from them, the farther the better. My fucking dealer won't tell me where to go so I just keep driving. He finally tells me a place and I'm far as fuck away. He knows this. Ugh. He got pissed that I went so far away and wasted his time, he legit laughed his ass off when I told him I told the cops I was out joyriding, he was like, 'you didn't fucking lie, you told that cop the truth!' Acting like it was a knee slapper, chill dude. 

An hour after first pulling into the sketchy gas station I am sitting in a liquor store parking lot waiting for him, he told us run into get him wraps and blend in. I stay back and decide to throw my cup away, as I'm walking to the trashcan I lock my car, its the hood after all. My car has an expensive aftermarket alarm system with a high tech keypad. I click my lock button and was startled that it makes a police siren sound when the car is finally locked up. Shit, did anyone notice that? Let me run back to my car and text my cousin we'll be over in a few. Get back in my car and start to type the text only to realize the only thing in my hand is my cup, where the fuck is my phone? I had it when I got out. I didn't do what I fucking think I did, did I? Ugh, I did. I fucking threw my phone in the trash while everyone was watching that weird ass white girl. 

We finally got our shit. Finally on our way home after this, god we just want to get high at this point. I look down and see a text from my dude. He gave us the wrong order. NOPE. FUCKING NOPE. I am taking whatever it is and we can sort it out later, I am not dealing with meeting him again. Turns out he got us the right order but forgot to add a half gram of hard when we changed our order. Its cool, he'll just get us tomorrow, he knows we'll see him tomorrow. 

We are safe to go home and finally enjoy our drugs. 

And I broke the number one rule of the person selling me the car, do not get fucking pulled over. 

But. Boy was I so fucking high last night, its all like a blur.

Chris Christie is in charge with leading this new commission that was designed to combat opioid addiction and the opioid crisis.  How effective do you think this will be?  One way to combat this epidemic is to legalize marijuana because here in Colorado we have seen addiction to opiates decrease since people can use pot for pain without being thrown in jail.

What is your guy's opinion on this news?",1490890053.0
