I just got a bunch of sites telling me it was risky but not how to use it safely. 

I'm just wondering, do I drink it before taking my meds, and if so, how long? take my meds with it? drink it right after? 

bear in mind I'm also on promethazine which my doc claims can also be a potentiator. idk if that effects my ability to use grapefruit juice safely, but figured I'd ask. 

thanks in advance for any help you can offer. ",1535694431.0

I don't want to see people struggle, and for some people to use hate or judgemental messages to label addiction and to validate their viewpoint - this is not the answer.

Basically I had the typical story of starting on hydrocodone and oxy and eventually graduating to heroin and now I‚Äôve been on subs for 6 months. I really quite enjoyed being on the subs if I‚Äôm being honest but I‚Äôm moving across the country to get a new job and I have to quit before then. Basically what I want to know is, about how long will it take for this feeling of absolute boredom to go away? Every single day I just feel like I can‚Äôt enjoy a single thing and I just feel so depressed and uninterested in everything. I know the physical withdrawl will end in about a week, but how long do the mental effects typically take to start getting better? Keep in mind I was only seriously addicted to heroin for about a year and a half before I switched to subs but it would seem I‚Äôm hyper-sensitive to addiction because even when I was only doing 30 mg hydrocodone every day I was still so deep in it and quitting seemed like an impossible feat. But now I really have no choice, because I can‚Äôt get anything out there. It‚Äôs gonna be hard leaving my home and everything I‚Äôve ever known and I feel like the mental effects of withdrawl is going to make it unbearable. Oh and just for some perspective I‚Äôm only on my 1st day clean but I know how it is because I‚Äôve ran out many times in the past. I warned myself down to like one 8th of a suboxone every day before I quit. So, in your opinion, how long do you think the mental aspect will last?

&#x200B;

For the record I know many people think it is not enjoyable to take bupe but take it from me, an opiate addict for just about two decades now that has had very little clean time and had a high tolerance to iv heroin and pharms, if you let your tolerance drop enough low doses of bupe can be very enjoyable. Not in the I'm nodding out all day but definitely a good buzz. Been doing it for about a year now so please don't post to tell me its not possible or unsustainable to get a bupe buzz for more than a month. It is if you space out your doses by at least every other day and keep doses below 2mg a day, preferably 1mg a day you can maintain the buzz. Ideally I try and take 1 mg a day or less and only use once or twice a week. Been going strong this way since I was locked up. Know plenty of junkies who made the switch in prison and enjoy it plenty. Many who have done so for years.

&#x200B;

So please, people who have both snorted and iv'ed their bupe, which do you prefer for getting a buzz and why?",1535682752.0

I feel like I have the flu but obviously as we all know and despise this is the caveat that opiates inherently carry. 

Its been 3 years of opiates now so far. These are sourced from my regular gp who knows a fair amount about chronic pain. I have problems with sciatica, herniated discs in my lower back, narrowing discs in my neck and signs of spinal stenosis and degenerative disc disease all shown on my MRI I waited about a year to get. This was my second MRI. 

Admittedly I'm dependant and borderline addicted at the time however because I had not found alternatives for my pain  I relied on opiates way too heavily and my drug use in general became obscene to a point I seriously couldn't even actually perceive who I actually was and all my identity centered around substances. 

Basically I became a psychonaut I guess you could say but not with psychedelics but addictive substances making me no better then a hardcore junkie. But I digress that's enough backstory. 

Shakily I walk back to my room and pull out my pill crusher and a 40mg oxycontin and 10 percocet. Twist the pill crusher and dump out the white powder and grab a pen and hollow out its contents so I can insufflate. Then grab a card and line up the powder into two trails. Each one is delivered up one nostril and I then down some water with the 10 percs. I also decide to grab one of my 2mg clonazepams and put it under my tongue then proceed to smoke a snap out of my bong. 

At this point I'm feeling extremely euphoric but still stable and functional and go outside to check the mail as I have a darknet order I have been waiting on. I grab the key unsure if it will be there and find four pieces of lettermail addressed to me. Inside one of them just encloses the drugs in a greeting card and a simple plastic bag. Suffices for domestic orders really. This order contains 1 gram of pure acetyl fentanyl. I ordered this based on my tolerance being excessively high, also for if I get cut off my prescriptions and wanting to conserve some of my pharma opiates as they never seem to last the full month before my next appointment to refill 60 40mg oxycontin, 30 2mg clonazepam and 100 10mg oxy or 200 percocet ( A few months before my doctor was actually writing for 300 percocet a month which was insane)depending on what he feels like writing. The next envelope is more secure and uses a vacuum seal and a moisture barrier bag. This contains 1 gram of pure powder shiny crystalline looking etizolam. I ordered this to make my clonazepam go farther or if I get cut off. Next envelope contains a gram of mxe as currently at the time this is my favorite drug. On top of that I also receive a gram of rock MDMA in the last envelope for my girlfriend. 

I leave these drugs at home because I need to see my doctor as its refill day. Everything is fine and he fills them without any questions or concerns really and I head home. Once I get home I have a small line of the fentalogue and pass out waking up to my girlfriend coming in the room. She comments on how I was sleeping strangely and look sort of out of it. However she knows I take prescriptions and order things off the onion fields. She has had a hard day doing residential cleaning and though she is not much of a drug user takes an ativan for her anxiety and I show her the MDMA that looks like a chunk of glass almost. She decides to take a couple points and eventually her eyes roll into the back of her head and she is nodding just not the way we all know and love. 

Through the night I use mxe and etizolam and also have 1 beer and we watch movies and listen to music and have sex. We stay up all night long and eventually we can see the sunlight coming in the room and at this point we are dead tired and my girlfriend goes outside for a cigarette. I realize I'm not much opiated anymore and have a line of acetyl fentanyl. This is where everything goes black and I don't remember anything.",1535658790.0

I figured, okay sure, I'll come by while she's at work and throw away the miscellaneous shit I know she doesn't want. I smoked a joint and brought some trash bags.

Here comes the fuck up.

I threw away a bottle of aspirin that was sitting under my mom's basement cabinet. I opened it and checked, and it was for sure the yellow aspirin that I know my dad takes for his heart. The lighting in the bathroom is kind of weird and I saw that the pills were kind of off but I didn't think anything of it. I thought maybe the coating had melted off a little because of the heat.

Well here comes the fucking realization. 

15 fucking years ago, I watched my mom take my grandmothers M boxes and shove them in an aspirin bottle. I only remember this because I asked my mom ""why does gram have to take so much medicine?"" And my mom explained that pain medicine was helping her deal with a botched surgery and whatever, and that she just had another surgery, and yada yada.

GUYS I THREW AWAY AT LEAST 10 FUCKING 40MG OXYS AND BROUGHT THE FUCKING BAG TO THE DUMP. I MIGHT BE THE DUMBEST MOTHERFUCKER ON THE EAST COAST.

I thought this was interesting.

>it has generally been thought that all opioid molecules, natural or synthetic, impart their signal only from receptors on the surface of the cell. Opioid-bound receptors are then taken inside the cell to compartments called endosomes, but receptors were thought not to signal from this location. Overturning this long-held view, the research team discovered that receptors actually remain active in endosomes and they use the endosome to sustain the signal within cells.

>But in the most intriguing twist, the research team discovered that morphine and synthetic opioids activate receptors in yet another internal location called the Golgi apparatus, where endogenous opioids are unable to produce any activation at all.

¬†‚ÄúDrugs, which we generally thought of as mimics of endogenous opioids, actually produce different effects by activating receptors in a place that natural molecules cannot access.‚Äù

9bk2rt,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9bk2rt/uldn_and_opioid_tolerance/,6,https://redd.it/9bk2rt,InfiniteEyes0609,ULDN and opioid tolerance,"I thought I'd make an official post about this since it may help someone in the future.  The first thing to note is that I've achieved these results with Kratom.

A little background.  I had been taking Kratom for a couple of years.  I took 6g per day, split into 2 doses of 3g.  I never once felt bad on this dosing regimen; never woke up sweating or feeling moody.  I could go 12 hours between doses pretty easily.  At this point, Kratom did not interfere in my life one bit.

Then I tried tianeptine.  After my first real big dose of tianeptine sulfate, I found out Kratom no longer worked on me, so I was stuck using tia to fight off withdrawals.  After 7 weeks of tia use and abuse, I jumped and haven't looked back since.  It's been over 3 months now, and I developed such hate for it that I haven't craved it once, not even when I found an old NM container with some...I didn't hesitate to throw it out.

After this I had to take about 20g of Kratom per day to feel fine, and now I had to dose every 4 to 6 hours.  Needless to say, this dosing scheme sucked and it did interfere with my life.  I started to look at all the ways I could reverse my tolerance.  I learned about proglumide but couldn't get any.  I learned about memantine and got some but it seems like it was bunk, as I've taken big (150mg) doses of it and not felt the slightest thing.  I'm waiting on some more memantine from a different source and will post my results with that.  I've been taking 30mg DXM every night before bed.  

Then starting about 6 days ago I began taking ULDN (Ultra Low Dose Naltrexone).  I bought some LDN drops and further diluted these drops in distilled water.  I made a solution that was 50ug of naltrexone per ml, or roughly 2.5ug per drop.  The first day I took 2 drops, or 5ug.  The second day I took 1ml, or 50ug.  The third day I took 100ug, the fourth day I took 250ug, and the fifth day I took 500ug, or 0.5mg, and last night I took 250ug.  Before starting ULDN I had been able to taper my 20gpd of Kratom to about 13gpd in 3 or 4 doses thoughout the day.  Then, magically, on day 4 of my ULDN experiment I took 3g in the morning and 3g in the afternoon and all of a sudden I could dose 6gpd like before and go 12 hours without dosing.

My plan is to stay here for a few days and continue cutting.  I post this in case it can help someone with tianeptine, as I've already read various studies that say chronic administration of ULDN along with an opioid agonist may reverse tolerance, shorten the acute withdrawal period, and attenuate the expression of any withdrawal symptoms.  I'm hoping this would work with tia and any other opiod as well. 

TL;DR:  Tianeptine ruined my tolerance so bad that my usual kratom dose of 6gpd split into 2 doses 12 hours apart became 20gpd split into 4 doses 5 hours apart.  After a few days of taking Ultra Low Dose Naltrexone, I was able to go back to my old dosing schedule and could once more go 12 hours without dosing.  I'm hoping these results translate to tianeptine and other opiods and may help others taper and quit in the future.",1535639190.0

I'm in it for the long haul.,"Currently sitting in my parents bathroom as I am typing this, at 6am on August 30th, 2018. Just did the last of my dope. My bags are packed. I'm officially moving out in two hours. Away from this place, where I can take a short 15minute drive to pick up my favorite drugs, crack and heroin, sold out in the open on the street, in front of passerbys, in front of cars driving by, and in front of cops parked at the corner, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, no appointments necessary, no connections necessary, and no phone calls necessary, for as little as $7. It's a really run down, stereotypical looking trap spot, a spot you'd see ina rap music video. A very short drive from my nice looking, upper class neighborhood. A place that'd seem scary to a lot of people, though a place I enjoy driving to, being in, and using in, where people I don't even recognize know me by name run up to me and ask me what I need. It's an odd type of place one would enjoy the environment of, however what I really loved about it was the drugs. 






Starting out as a Heroin addict 6 years ago at the age of 18, I'd never imagined a place where the drugs were SO easily and readily accessible and available. It was a dream I didn't know I had. My time is finally up though. It's time to leave before I end up dead or in prison. I was officially taken off supervised probation a little over a week ago, and my parents and I had been planning this move. I HAVE to leave. There's no other option. Rehab didn't work. Suboxone didn't work. Functional use is not possible [for me]. I've done this before, 3 or 4 times to be exact, quitting. The longest I made it was almost two years. The issue I have here is the accessibility. Once I leave I am thoroughly confident that I can surpass 2 years and longer of clean time. The place I am moving to is states away, a small town almost in the middle of no where, away from that toxic yet seemingly graceful environment disguised by the wonderful rush of dopamine the drugs gave you. 





Taking me in is my brother. Oddly, it seems like fate, we had only reconnected after being separated for over 15 years, on Christmas of 2015. I visited him at the place I'm moving to and when it came time to, I did not want to leave. It is a beautiful place, with a beautiful beach just a drive away as short as the one I'd take daily to buy drugs. My brother and I have so much in common its almost like we lived the same life. We have only seen each other 3 or 4 times since we'd separated, yet are closer than my father and I who I Iived with for all 24 years of my life, who just yesterday asked me what my girlfriend's name was. A girl I had been seeing for over a year and a half. I never fully grasped how estranged we were until he had asked me this. Our relationship, which was never close in the first place, is permanently ruined through my drug use. I've stolen thousands of dollars worth of things from him and my mother, so it is absolutely understandable that they are kicking me out, however it is in the most gentle way possible, and in a way that is helping me. I never deserved the number of chances they gave me in the first place. For all of that and this last bit of help they are giving me, I am truly grateful.

No idea how I'm going to stay awake at work today.,"So, I didn't sleep much Monday or Tuesday night from doing opiates. I was super sleepy at work yesterday and could barely hold my eyes open. Told my boss I had not been able to sleep the previous night and used PTO to leave at noon. The plan was to go home and take a long ass nap, and get plenty of sleep last night. But then of course a curve ball is thrown my way. Dboy texts me as I'm driving home and says he got some new product. So stupid me bought a bag, figuring if I used it mid afternoon it wouldn't affect my sleep. Well despite being tired as fuck last night I only slept a few hours. 

I've had multiple cups of coffee, and three Vivarin tablets (caffeine pills). I feel like I should be wired as I'm already pretty sensitive to caffeine. I'm barely able to hold my eyes open sitting here at my desk. And the worst part is that I have to help a colleague work on building an app today, so I can't leave early. I also had planned a first meet/date after work. Fuck me. 

Is it possible to be so tired that no amount of caffeine will actually help? Like I feel my eyes are so tired that nothing is going to make them alert and wide open. ",1535634083.0

I'm literally still very young, younger than maybe half of the people in this subreddit, though that's irrelevant to this.

Recently, my life has gone to shit, quite literally.
Each day there's always something that prevents me from feeling 'Happy' etc, etc.
I'm burdened with this unholy depression that, to many of you, can be considered as, 'not bad'
Though I have a different belief.

On top of this, I seem to want to die. I don't want to be alive, and I mean that with every bone in this young bois body. I can't stand being alive, so much to the point where I've cried. Cried at the thought of being held captive in this terrible, plague-like thing called, existence.
I believed that drugs would make everything better, like most of you.
I'm well interested in other drugs, rather than weed and stolen antidepressants.
I want psychedelics, I want something other than this depression inducing drug.

I'm getting well off-track, but for full disclosure, I'm not apologizing, I'm just stating something.

""Hey man, get off me "" I heard like an annoying conscious voice inside of my own head,
     ""What the fuck?? ""
      I scanned my surroundings, realizing what had just happened and quickly faced the window folding my arms and cradling my head Into the left arm of my seat as I dozed off again into my last great slumber .
     4 and a half hours before that very moment,  I snapped awake with the SWOOSH of water splashing my face , I scanned cautiously, realizing again , ""Fuck, not in the shower again, I could've drowned or something, Eh, who gives a shit anyways "" , I laughed quietly under my breath to myself, knowing death wasn't anywhere close.
      ""C, TURN THE FUCKING SHOWER OFF AND FINISH GETTING READY, YOU'RE GOING TO BE LATE FOR THE PLANE !!""
      The euphoria I was experiencing quickly fading into a suttle anger that didn't faze me, but rushed the intoxicated slowness of my walk when it came to getting shit done period. 
      "" Just putting clothes on! I'll be out in less than 5 minutes!"" 
      I heard no reply , but at this point my parents knew what was up, knew that 5 minutes NEVER actually means 5 minutes nod time, no more time could be wasted , as my phone glistened with the codensation of the warm vapor flowing throughout the entirety of my small suburban bathroom. 1 line lay protruding from the opaque , glistened screen. Quickly, I grabbed my small-cut straw and inhaled quicker than I would at the last second arising from the depths of a dive into a pool, ""the dying fight for air"" , Threw my clothing on, hair in a bun, ready to have an exciting plane experience! 
      This was absolutely incorrect, I ran upstairs into my room, knowing my room would be searched upon leaving , i had to find somewhere good , it was my only chance , Think, Think, C , where could she not look,  where the fuck should i.... "" "" OH SHIT, PERFECT!"" I then put about .2 (What I had left), into a piece of parchment paper and stuck it in a candle with a silver lid atop it's cylinder fixture. 
      ""WAIT"" my mind screamed as I almost exited my room, ""I need just a little more , just a little bit "" , My brain had the best of me at this point.
      I grabbed my straw once again,  lifting the chrome lid,  then , while opening the parchment paper carefully I noticed a good amount of powder along with the rocks , perfect , just to stick the straw in and get all the powder... a second later all the powder was gone, leaving a few rocks (one maybe being gone may have snorted a rock along with it I'm not sure ), vision, increasingly fading to grey , then back to normal , then back to grey , I threw the lid onto the candle , stuffed it into a box and wobbled out of my room , barely conscious,  I walked out   of my house towards my car, parents waiting to drive me , slowly fading to black as I reach the seat of the car ...

So in the last 6 months ive basically maintained on loperamide at about an average dose of 100mgs a day sometimes more sometimes less. 
     In this 6 months I developed a bad benzo addiction which I've since stopped as of a month ago, but I can't give up lope even tho I know its terrible for me, and I'm just tired of keeping up a dope habit, so I'm stuck on lope, however I chip occasionally sometimes with dope/fent lately its been with oxy( ir oxy not shitty neos) anyway the past 6 times I've tried to get high on oxy I barely even feel it at all.
  I figured it was because I wasn't doing enough even tho my tolerance should be pretty fucking low, last nite I snorted 130mgs of 100% real oxy no presses or anything I know its fucking real and I barely even got a head change I got a little body high but I thought i should feel pretty Damn good from it, now ive tried slamming it and eating it and all of them have been pretty much the same I felt iv decent but not like I feel i shoulda.
   So ive basically given up on getting high for rite now but if some one with a little more knowledge about body chemistry please give me some input about this shit. And I'm just gonna go ahead and say this because I already know some one is gonna be like oh but loperamide doesn't cross the bbb so your just psyching yourself out and this doesn't make sense, regardless of what Wikipedia says I know at least some of it does becausr when I don't takr it I get withdrawals like any other opiate and ive used it when I was dope sick as Fuck shooting Damn near a ball a day and it got rid of 90 percent of my withdrawals.

I am sure sone of the finer stuff got pulled through or stuck in the paper towel but I would say I got about 80% of it back at least. 

Sucked it up onto the paper towel then held it over a book and turned off the suction and shook it off onto the book.

My father has always trashed me. He callsme a druggie, and everything else, even though ive only used Suboxone and Klonopin at very low doseages, and am at my lowest doseages ever, i dont get why he has the gall to be like this to me.

I chose not to go to my MRI with him based on all the things hes said to me, and made fun of me, i am truthfully scared that he will try to have me committed to a psychiatric facility because he doesn't like it when im in pain and considers it a psychiatric problem.

Meanwhile, his heart problem is entirely ""real"" (even though theres no evidence)


He is totally against all opioids including suboxone. I hurt , myself, trying to talk to him. I do not have a choice . 

You can call me a bitch, whatever, but im not in a physical state where i can move out, as well as support myself, as well as take care of my pain problems.



So i guess my question would be, how do i speak to my father about pain in a way that he will understand? My father grew up in the Bronx and he is very hard headed and thinks everything that he ""thinks"" is based in reality and fact, and everything anyone else says , even if it comes from a doctor, is untrue.

I do wish to get along with him, but i also feel he also he underlying conditions, maybe bipolar disorder. He will go off and scream at things for no reason . no reason whatsoever.


When i was younger i believe my MOTHER would make fun of my father after he had cancer saying he was a pill popper (this was over 20 yrs ago)

All the things that have happened to me come back to haunt me everytime my father is obnoxious to me. 

in year 2000 i had my ass kicked by my older brother whom i had not seen  in over a year. i was speaking to my mother on the phone, asking her where is $5 as i had just come home from the fair and wanted to get something to eat . My brother gets on the phone, drunk, cusses me out, threatens me, hangs up, 

I walk out my back door, lock the door, and the motherfucker pulled up in the backyard, lol, oops, i effectively locked myself out.


my brother beat me up for over two hours . i was screaming for someone to call the police but nobody heard me due to the noise of the fair which is diagonally across the street . 

when my parents came home, they could not stop him, and were not calling the police. at that point, i pulled out a knife, and he proceeded to spear me through a tree/bush , and i stabbed him a little bit (not much, but enough to make him keep punching my lights out ) {in that moment i knew that if i could show my parents what hes doing to me i knew that i would be the better person so to speak so i began laughing while he was punching me}

My father took the knife an threw it in the woods

My mother lied to the police,
I got taken to jail,

5 hrs pass and my parents come to pick me up, as obviously my brother wasnt going to press charges

My brother is a professional bodybuilder, he is very strong in comparison to me  or anyone really . 

After that, is when i began my ""real drug use"" i.e. taking suboxone and oxy 80s . 


When my brother beat me up, i had detoxed, cold turkey, from 32mg of Suboxone due to the fact i was being over-dosed . I did it the hard way, as my kidneys were causing water retention in my feet i was scared i was going to die.


Theres more to the story but

I can't really talk to my father anymore, and everything gets blamed on me, no matter what. My father treats me as if i am subhuman because i use suboxone and used to take pain meds. 

Yes, i had an addicton, over 10 years ago

But now i have intense pain and that doesnt give him a reason to not only treat me like shit, but treat my mother like shit.


my father has continuously called the police on me because i will not take his bullshit anymore. the same things that he does to me, he does to my mother, and i really need my mom, as she is the only one i can truthfully talk to . However, she cannot drive very far . And i cannot drive due to the pain i am in.


Overall i am in a very shitty situation and each person involved is suffering because of it .

i want to kill myself in one way, but in another way, i just wish people would be nice and not have an agenda . i just dont want to be in pain anymore. i have tried a lot of things, all NSAIDS, etc... accupuncture, chiro, phys therapy (my Dr. told me NOT to go back.)

my mother tells him to be nice to me, and he says hes going to beat her up and throw her out .


i have records of some of this as he threatens me everyother day


my father and i also run a business together that i developed from the ground up 10 years ago. while i am appreciative for his great help i also want a father that i can simply talk to without him getting agravated. Who teh fuck screams over meaningless shit? Like me asking him to help me move something, or while im doing the dishes he is screaming at me ""im wasting water"".


i would l ike to get counseling/help but i also dont want to be blamed .


My mom wants us all to get along but doesnt follow through with truthfully getting us all help, and ive been in pain for 8 years or more , and its now radiating into other areas of my body and getting worse and all i am looking for is fucking help and i get destroyed .


Yes, i yell and scream, but thats because i think about all the shit that my father has said to me , and i wish that he was just nicer, i know he has it in him, 
But he was also abused by my mother's parents. Which i guess he thinks gives him the right to shit on my mother and i day in and day out


He thinks that i am brainwashed , and i was brainwashed to ""hate him"" by my grandmother and aunt.

This part is partially true unfortunately . My grandma and aunt are in the divorcee club, and i had to stay there when i was very young. They would say to me ""repeat after me""

""Your father is wacko jacko"" (which is what was popular at the time)

""Your father is OJ""


Then we would drive past the bar, and we would see a truck at the bar, that looked like my fathers, they would point and laugh and says ""Look, theres your father at the bar!"" and i would say to them ""No, thats not his truck""

They would go ""yes it is"" ... thinking i am too young to know better, so yes , my father was shitted on.

My mother left my father two or three times when i was younger, as above, i was forced to stay with them. 

My mothers reasoning for this , is that, he wasnt nice to me, and was beginning to become physically abusive, one time throwing me across the room for touching the mousepad.


My father will frequently bring up opiates and drugs to draw us into having an arguement with him. and with my mother he will bring up things about her mother and father just to draw us into arguing with him.



The only time i felt my father was truthfully nice to me in this past year was a week or two ago when he thought he had a heart problem.


Im stuck.


My suboxone Dr. is 2 hrs away


I am not CURRENTLY in need of suboxone, but in the future i will be, and the car ride hurts my neck and jaw so fucking bad that i vomit several times on the way there and the way back . 

my father has called the police on me for no reason, after drawing us into arguing with him . then my mother gets flustered and doesnt know what to say or do with the police officers so she usually just tells them ""well my son was yelling because he doesnt feel well""

Then i do this song and dance with the police officers where they try to force me togo to a mental institution . Its fucking hilarious TBH especially when i get these PO noobs , i just fuck with them at this point. My father doesnt care to be nice. he just doesnt care..


But the problem with this is that the nervousness is causing me not to eat, i have lost 40 lbs since the start of 2018 and my blood tests are coming back good so far . Why am i losing so much weight when i cant even fucking move around?


if you have any questions about my situation ask them, as i need all the help i can get.

I plan to admit myself to a counselor or psychologist as i have nobody to really talk to as my mother pow-wows with my father because my father says he will beat her up and throw her out .... its sickening, just sickening . 


i just want my dad to be nice. if he was nice, theres a chance my pain would be greatly reduced. i would be less nervous, i would move around more , and be a little more social . 

Maybe i wouldnt need any medicine at all ,

But he is just a pompous ass. He also, thinks, now that Donald Trump is president, that he can get away with more of this type of abuse.


I understand that he doesnt like me taking suboxone or whatever, and that i had a hard time when i was younger, but jesus christ, if he has a heart problem, how can he scream for 12 hours a day?

He claims that ""he  knows what i am looking for""
and that ""you only want opiates""
as another one of his gimmicks to draw us into arguing with him.

So now when i get my MRI - if theres nothing on it - its free game for him to run his mouth about how all my pain is psychological rather than physical .............. im sad . i just wanna be happy tbh

im not really depressed, i just need a little easier life, i.e not driving 2 hrs to acquire a suboxone script.

I am looking for local  sub doctors, but i dont wanna pay $700 introduction fee..
And not only that, im not truthfully sure that it even helps me with my pain at all , i have to even feel nervous when im taking them becaue my father hates everything besides nicotine and alcohol...................


Suggestions? (besides moving out, id lose my business.... and i wouldnt have any help for pain .)

anyone been in this position before?


When i wake up at night, sometimes i scream, because of the pain, it is very hard for me to go back to sleep, as my neck gets extremely swollen if i get up and down several times. i feel bad that i have to wake my mother up for a neckrub, and it is all wareing on me. 

Im also blamed for all problems that they have. anything and everything. I don't smoke, yet im blamed for his walls being yellow . ....


Somewhere in my father is a good person....

My mom doesnt know shit about computers, but she wants to help me, she doesnt really know how, as she works, and my father doesnt . its hard . its also weird. my mother sleeps in the fucking livingroom... for a long , long, long time now. When iw as younger, my mother would jump out of the car and run away. my mother would run away at night time which caused me to sleep with her at night because i was scared she would leave me . 

so basically, my father blames my mother, and my mother blames me because she doesnt have anyone to blame. 

honestly, i think my mother enjoys being abused . shes like subserviant to it . its weird. she wont do ANYTHING to help their own personal martial issues  . because she likes it. my father told me she was abused when she was young, and then she goes on to tell us about how her father would drag her up the stairs by her hair . 

Im going to be 30 in a few days. My dad is 70. my mom is 61.



My father has a friend that overdosed, died, and was revived on the operating table. This dude is obese like 500lbs and was taking like 500mg of morphine a day. 

He literally would rather that i kill myself than have an opioid for pain.

I have been prescribed weak opioids for pain, i have NOT tried getting aNYTHING at all yet. I WILL BE, in the future, especially if this negative attitude of theirs does not cease . my mother only supports my father because my father will do things , like, when they take a ride to get a pizza, he wont let her out of the car until hes finished yelling at her, and i see them driving around the block several times.


So yea, pops is super anti-drug, anti-opiates . i swear to god imma tap his morphine line when he gets ill . just kidding. 

My mom is very nice, but she allows this to go on...


I feel really badbecause she feels bad .


Sometimes its very hard for me to shutup because ive been in pain for so long and ahve been dicked around by many physicians due to being on suboxone . in a way its the greatest drug ever, on the other hand you get treated as if you're sub-human. even by your own father.",1535566157.0

Early 2000s, oxycotin booming. It is very easy to obtain in large amounts, in some cases, multiple scripts from multiple doctors. Millions of people get hooked, recreationaly or for legit pain. 

9/11 happens, we invade Afghanistan. Many people use painkillers to cope with with loved ones going off to war, or ones that died in terror attacks. As well as emotional pain from loss of jobs. I know personally many peoples lives fell apart after the terror attacks just because of the scary state of the country at the time and it triggered mental illness in them, and used drugs to cope with that.
___________________________________

Afghanistan, one of the biggest heroin producers in the world, is a country we are still occupying today. Many argue we shouldn't even be there anymore. We start seeing a flood of heroin in the country like never before, and the DEA starts cracking down on pharma painkillers.

People losing their huge scripts of painkillers make the jump to heroin as they can no longer get it/or as much legally. As time goes by, fentanyl laced heroin starts to become way too common, and the DEA continues to crack down on legal opiates so much that doctors are scared to prescribe it, and are even worried about the DEA looking into the scripts they've been prescribing for years to their patients and end up cutting it down, if not cut it off completely. 

Now, we have the biggest opiate epidemic we've ever seen in the United States.

My question is, was this all planned to happen like this? I can't understand how this would all be a big coincidence. I can only come to the conclusion of this being some sort of population control. Similar to the theories in the 70s and 80s with the DEA in Columbia cracking down on cocaine, then seeing a flood of crack in the 80s

Xanax: I was originally enticed by the mix as i heard it enhances the nod with the negative of having Xanax take away the euphoria. 100% DID enhance the nod, which sounds great but the euphoria (not necessarily turned to dysphoria), but with the intense nods not being euphoric it felt almost pointless in my opinion, won‚Äôt be mixing the two again.

So I luckily got my first paycheck today from my new job. I had enough in my sack to last me a little bit longer than today, but of course I had to celebrate the fact that I could go get more. So I finished that little bit and finished up all I had to do at work in order to get off and hit up the ATM. Everything is going smooth, traffic was sweet, was feeling real good the whole way down to the city, and I had finished work at the perfect time for my plug to open up shop himself. So I make it to see him, go in and get a free cookie and lemonade and grab my sack and I'm on the way back in less than 10 minutes of making it into the city. Well it's been a tradition that before I leave I gotta find a safe place to either park or a single toilet bathroom that locks and gives me privacy. So I've found a gas station that has this and I always stop at it before I hop back on the interstate. Well as I pull in and park I see a girl looking a bit rough just sitting there up against the building. She was wearing some Dark John Lennon looking sun glasses so I couldn't see her eyes, but judging how her body was reacting you could tell she was nodding. So I go in, buy a scratch off and ask for the bathroom key, do my business and walk out. I don't smoke in my car so I'm outside in the shade near her and the building smoking a cigarette. I heard a guy, that had the look of someone who used, hollering a name and she wasn't responding, not only because nodding but because it wasn't her name. So he walks up and asks if she's alright and stuff and ask me if she's ok I'm like I dunno I'm not with her I'm just smoking a cig and about to head back home. So he finally gets a response from her and he asks again if she's okay she just says yeah I'm just a bit sick. So he sits his snack cake and drink down and says don't let anything happen to my stuff and he walks in the store. As he walks out to get his stuff he tossed her down a bag and said here it ain't much but it should help. I got his attention as he took off walking and said bruh that's what's up man, that shits cool as a fucking fan. He said yeah man it's the way it is, you just gotta give and let the cycle do its thing and good karma. So after that she asked me if I had a spare cigarette and I obliged and I stood there smoking and having a conversation with her. She was intelligent and knew about bioavailability but she mentioned something about BTH and how it has a good bioavailability of swallowing it  and I was like no no no. Don't swallow the H. She didn't know what boofing or plugging was though. I told her to check out reddit if she ever got her phone working again. It's just cool to see someone getting blessed like that outta nowhere. 

 
Side note, I love my plug as far as being prompt and professional in the business, he takes great caution in making sure we're not sitting around in the hood all day looking suspicious and getting eyeballed by the police. Ain't it funny that the only time white people are racially profiled is when they are in the hood buying drugs? Like come on that's not fair...

Before you ask, no I didn't want to chance doing a hand off of drugs to someone I didn't know for one and other things considering my given situation that I personally am in. I don't care to share and I'm not a completely greedy person, but I was still technically in the hood and had to be safe and yeah...

‚Äã‚Äã
‚Äã‚ÄãDiane didn‚Äôt look like a crack head. Sure, she was short and overweight and her age showed. I always imagined she was somewhere in her mid fifties. She showed me pictures of herself from her younger days and she had been drop dead gorgeous, once upon a time when weed was Moroccan and pants had bell bottom legs. Now she was an old cape battleaxe. Her voice was low and raspy from years of smoking Newport 100s. I‚Äôm sure all the crack smoke played a part too. But underneath all that pudge and the hard leathery skin was a big heart. Diane cared about people. And when she learned I was homeless the night I met her, smoking coke in her car with reggie driving around Hyannis, she immediately offered me a place to live. Diane had been homeless in Hyannis years before, but she had never forgotten her roots, so to speak. She had lifted herself out of the street and into a life in a beautiful 4 bedroom house that she shared with 3 older men, all of whom had also been homeless at one point or another. It was a strange arrangement but somehow they seemed to make it work. 

‚Äã‚ÄãDiane took me to Ocean State Job Lot the very next day after I met her and bought me a $20 twin airmatress that we setup at the foot of her bed in her bedroom. She washed pillows and a big plushie purple blanket for me to use, and that blanket was the warmest fucking blanket I‚Äôve ever had the pleasure of sleeping under in my life. It almost made me forget the absolute disaster my life had become. 

‚Äã‚ÄãDiane and I started to run together, and people noticed. Everywhere her white Chevy went, I was usually in it, riding shotgun. We got high together, daily. She drove me to reup when I started making moves, and to hit sales when I needed to move work. I fucked with Diane the long way, even if I never actually fucked her. She was good people.
‚Äã‚ÄãFor example, I had been living on Diane‚Äôs bedroom floor for a few days when, one night, I slipped into her bathroom around 1am. She was snoring on her bed, sound asleep. I had been waiting for her to pass out because she hated that I shot dope. But like any good heroin addict will tell you, I had no choice in the matter. The methadone clinic was in Yarmouth off exit 6, but it might has well have been non-existent. I had no transportation of my own, and there was no public bus route to speak of. So I was shooting dope, even if Diane didn‚Äôt want me to. Like I said, I didn‚Äôt have much choice in the matter.

‚Äã‚ÄãAnyway, I got myself into her bathroom, which she had exclusive rights to, I locked the door, making sure the exhaust fan was running to muffle any noise I might make. To anyone else I hoped it would sound like I was just taking a shit. I got my heroin out and prepped a nice size shot, one I had been waiting many hours to do. I sat myself on the toilet, tied my arm off, and then‚Ä¶. nothing. Deep, black, silent bliss. I don‚Äôt even remember actually injecting the shot.

‚Äã‚Äã
‚Äã‚ÄãWhen I came to, or better said, woke up, Diane was standing over me, shaking my arm. 

‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúOh my god, you scared the SHIT out of me!‚Äù she barked as I tried to get my bearings. My neck ached and I realized I was pretzeled in between the wall and the toilet I had been sitting on when I did my shot. The needle was still in my arm, hanging out of my skin, a long trail of blood down my forearm and wrist. 

‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúI thought you weren‚Äôt shooting up anymore!‚Äù she exclaimed as I removed the needle from my arm and dragged myself up and out from in between the wall and the toilet. 
‚Äã‚ÄãI couldn‚Äôt help but laugh a little at myself as I began apologizing to her. 

‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúLook, I‚Äôm really sorry, I didn‚Äôt mean to scare you.‚Äù I offered meekly, turning on my best puppy dog eyes. Diane was so good to me. I hated deceiving her. But heroin addiction isn‚Äôt about impulse control like cocaine addiction is, at least not all of it. Diane understood cocaine addiction. We smoked a lot of coke together, we bonded over it. But her knowledge of opiate addiction was limited, like most people. 

‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúWell what will it take for you to stop shooting up? Because I can‚Äôt have you overdosing here, I care about you too much to find you dead.‚Äù she asked as I cleaned up my shooting kit and washed the blood off my arm. 

‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúI mean the only thing I know of that works is methadone. But the clinic is in Yarmouth, and I would have to go every morning, 7 days a week without fail. It‚Äôs a giant commitment.‚Äù
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄùWe will go there in the morning‚Äù she countered without a single second of hesitation. ‚ÄúIf I take you will you promise not to shoot heroin anymore? Not shoot anything at all anymore?‚Äù
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄùFucking absolutely‚Äù I said. And she did exactly that. She took me to the clinic day in and day out, 7 days a week, from that day forward until we had a falling out, months later. While I lived with Diane I kept my promise. She took me to the clinic, I never missed a single day. She was a fucking angel to me. She never complained about having to take me. Eventually she let me start driving her car, her sleeping in the passenger seat, to the clinic and back. She never even asked me to reimburse her for the gas we used. In a very real sense, I owe Diane more than I could ever repay. 

‚Äã‚Äã
‚Äã‚Äã 
‚Äã‚ÄãAnyway, Diane used to volunteer at the soup kitchen. She pretty much ran it, actually. So I‚Äôd ride with her to dinner almost every night, and by doing so, I began to get to know a lot of the homeless crowd in Hyannis. 
‚Äã‚ÄãDiane introduced me to everyone. People would look at me a little funny, trying to figure out if Diane and I were fucking, but they quickly made their own realizations. It was obvious. I was not romantically involved with Diane. And to her credit, Diane never tried to be romantic with me. She was just a true friend. At least until the drugs got in the way, like they always do.
‚Äã‚Äã
One person I met was a lady we will call Joan, mostly because I have forgotten her name.
‚Äã‚ÄãI ended up at Joan‚Äôs tiny efficiency apartment one night that spring, hanging out with her sniffing her xanax and smoking coke while she got hammered on natural ice cans. Eventually her beer ran out, and she began to tell me how her next door neighbor was out of town, but that he had beer in his fridge. She convinced me that she had permission to go in his apartment and get the beer, but had lost the door key. And then she convinced me to break in. 
‚Äã‚ÄãI was never into that type of shit, breaking and entering. It felt wrong to me. I always imagined what I would feel like if it was my place being pilfered. But I had been sniffing xanax, so I was in that dissassociated haze that comes with large amounts of benzodiazipines. For some reason, when I take benzos, the person I become is nothing like the person I am sober. Its like Dr Jekyl and Mr Hyde, it really is that much of a dramatic change. I am not proud of some of the decisions I‚Äôve made in a benzo-induced stupor, and this is one of them.

‚Äã‚ÄãAt Joan‚Äôs behest, I first went to the front door, which was literally right next to her front door. It was the corner unit, in a single story building that stretched along the property. It must have been a small motel at some point, but now they rented the rooms out as a year-round efficiencies. 

‚Äã‚ÄãThe front door was locked, so I went back in to Joan‚Äôs room and she continued to prod me, working me up to the point that I went back outside, determined to get in this apartment. I didnt even really want to, but again, xanax. 

‚Äã‚ÄãI found the bathroom window in the back of the building, and a stray empty bucket laying against the foundation. The bucket was my step ladder. I went back into Joans room again and found a roll of duct tape. Back outside, I taped over the bottom pane of the bathroom window, and then with a single punch, I knocked the pane glass out and all over the bathroom sink and floor. The duct tape didnt do shit.
‚Äã‚ÄãI‚Äôm not a small man by any metric, but I somehow made it through that tiny bathroom window and into the apartment without a single cut from all the broken glass strewn across the bathroom.
‚Äã‚ÄãInside, I first made sure I had not tripped any alarms. I then opened the fridge, grabbed a case of cold beer, and walked out the front door, back to Joan, handing her the beer. 

‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúI‚Äôll be right back‚Äù I mumbled, as I walked back out. 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúDont take anything else!‚Äù Joan commanded, but I wasnt listening. Now, I was going to get something I wanted too. It seemed only right. I dont drink.

‚Äã‚ÄãInside, I found a filing cabinet. It was locked, but I found the key in about 30 seconds, and opened it up. Immediately, I knew what I had found when I saw the blue plastic case inside. 

‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúFIREARM‚Äù I screamed silently in my head. 
‚Äã‚ÄãI slid the case out of the cabinet drawer onto the floor and opened it. The sight of a brand new .38 caliber Smith & Wesson revolver took my breath away. 

‚Äã‚ÄãI‚Äôd be lying if I said I didn‚Äôt love guns.

 My girlfriend has been treating me like shit lately and I was mad because she slept with her ex  anyways this girl led me to the bathroom and tried to fuck me but I couldnt get hard partly bcs she was ugly and partly because I was in nod city haha.

She pulled my pants asked if I was clean and stuffed her face in my crotch. She started sucking my dick, I was mad at first but god damn it felt good. Then I put on a condom and had sex with her.

I find methadone so lackluster there is just no euphoria that actually make short term opiates enjoyable. Well that and I think the highs and lows actually have a pronounced effect on how good it feels when you cop a bag and get inebriated. 

Holy crap triggered lol just walked by foil with some powder sitting on it and a bag and a tooter at the train station just chilling on a seat was going to grab it but within two seconds someone saw it before I could. Was either buddies stuff who grabbed it or someone nodded and left forgetting about it. Really rare to actually see drug paraphernalia sitting around in my  middle class/upper scale area shows how much opiates are beginning to creep into every demographics area.

This is How it Went (Ms.AHL),"So my dad has know about our addiction for awhile. Hes an ex addict and I didn't choose to tell him. He knew far before I ever admitted it when he confronted me. Note that I'm the type of person who once confronted about something serious by someone I love is a) a terrible liar if I try and b) most of the time I can't even bring myself to lie or should I say, keep lying. So my dad has known and is the only person who did. He said a) he knew he couldn't stop us until we we're ready and b) was ""okay"" with it, not really but you know what I mean, so long as we we're happy. 

We've been struggling to detox by ourselves. Everytime we try we end up getting to the point where we're so sick we go back to the d-boy, if we had the money, because usually we help him out and it's free but if we've been sick the last 2 days we can't exactly run a few errands first. Or if we were too broke, before we had our nifty little arrangement, we figured out the cash side of things. Note we've gone 15 hours into day 2 before, so 39 hours total. 

We decided we needed help and I knew my dad was willing to help both of us. But, there's a complication, my dad along with being an ex-addict is a felon and he's in a work release prison program. While he doesn't live ""on-site"" anymore because he's progressed enough to have his own place, he does still have restrictions. 2 days ago today I called my dad and asked for his help detoxing. He said he'd do anything he could and started the approval process to do it at either his house or my grandpa's. Obviously some of his ""team"" had their concerned. 

Right off the bat they said my fiance ""AHL"" couldn't do it with us. He'd have to make his own plan. A plan my dad was still 100% willing to help with. Up until today though I knew they were worried about the ""safety"" of doing it in a non-medical environment, ER, hospital, mental hospital (just detox, or inpatient) I didn't think there were going to be any problems once we got the logistics figured out. 

Boy was I fucking wrong. Don't get me wrong, some of his team are on board but there is one person specifically who isn't. One of his therapists, let's call her A. I called A last night after meeting with my dad to talk about how it was going on his side and what he needed from me. He said A was concerned because she's had too many patients die before, in even medical detox. That even an MD she knew who specialized in detox wouldn't let his son do it at home, because of the risks and because if something did happen they'd have everything they needed right there (no shit, it's a hospital). It should be noted that I hate hospitals. I just went to the ER Sunday night after 3 weeks of having an asthma attack. I have a fairly mild form of asthma so yes, it is possible. However they told me if I had let it continue for another couple days to a week I could've died. 

I told A all of this and basically her response was she won't approve it at my dad's house or my grandpa's, her exact words, ""there's no way I'm letting that happen"". That the only way to do it is at a hospital. I told her I won't go. She said if I'm so eager to do it by myself that I can do it by myself and then go to the ER when I can't deal with it anymore. I told her I've tried doing it by myself and I know on my own, in that much pain I'd go back to my dealer before I ever went to the ER. I guess she doesn't believe me because her tune didn't change. I thanked her for her advice and here we are. 

TL;DR ready to get clean, dad is willing to help, he's a felon and has a team who needs to approve it at his house or with his involvememt at my grandpa's, one of his team (one of his therapists) told me she would never let either happen and that the only way to do it is in a hospital of some kind.

If that goes well, perhaps we can think of the best songs that aren't about heroin but which take on a new meaning when you're using, but for now, I'll go for those that are absolutely in there with you right now...

There are so many songs by Lou Reed to choose from but I'll go for a slightly less obvious one -

So lately, whilst keeping outwards appearances, it seems things have started going to shit and I know it's all my fault. I just can't stop myself, it feels as though nothing can make me feel happiness except chasing a blob of brown gunk down a piece of foil, ad nauseam (literally, as I'm eating so little I usually puke when I start smoking).

I'm tired of all the lies and bullshit, all the juggling with the money and pretending I'm buying books and clothes and cigarettes when in reality it's all going into the same thing. It doesn't even satisfy me that much, yet it's the only thing I yearn for. Not even the high, just chasing and chasing.

My girlfriend has stopped living with me because she doesn't want me to just leech off her money cause I spend all of mine on dope. I get angry more and more often, and she tells me I scare her. I've started using knives to persuade people to give me money. If it weren't for the fact that my girlfriend says that's not normal I would see no problem with it, as I feel entitled to rich tourists' cash.

My life is a long waiting period between baggies, and my only social contacts are with middle aged junkies who smoke up at my dealer's (I'm in my early twenties), as well as my girlfriend and three friends I see less and less, as I believe they are alienated by my recent behaviour.

The worst thing is that I am doing exactly the same things that were done to me when I began taking drugs. Intimidating people and manipulating them into buying a gram of chalk they know is not coke, taking them to an ATM at knifepoint; exactly the same things which were inflicted upon me and which made me believe people were pieces of shit. And now here I am, and I enjoy it because I like feeling power over some poor hipster teens or tourists.

I feel like I'm slowly becoming a piece of shit, a waste of space, and I don't seem to care. Why do I keep getting away with this? Deep down I know that as long as people keep believing my bullshit, I will go on with this shitty behaviour, and it's not going to end well. Only my girlfriend knows about this, though, and even then she doesn't know the full extent. My parents think I'm keeping it together and just smoke weed and such. They made me promise not to screw up, but it's starting to seem inevitable.

I've told myself I'll go back to NA, but I still have three baggies left, so it will have to wait...

Thanks for hearing me out, I needed to tell someone and I know you guys understand this shit. Hopefully one day I'll stop being a lazy, nasty fuck. The thing is I've alway's been very polite and helpful, and still am (when in ""normal"" mode); yet now it seems so easy to betray people who thought you're cool when they met you, and joking along with them knowing full well you'll pull a knife on them in a few minutes if they don't give in to verbal intimidation/insistence. I promised my gf I'll stop that shit at least, but man the idea of getting such easy money...

By the way I know I'm a massive cunt, at least I won't lie to myself on that aspect any longer.

EDIT. Thank you for confirming my suspicions. I am indeed an arsehole. I think I needed a reality check cause most of the junkies I hang out with either approve of these methods or they don't give a shit. This is not normal behaviour and I shall try to correct it. And thanks for telling me what a cunt I am (I mean it, I really needed that, people treat me like the victim, but I'm anything but.

So I went into rehab, one that I‚Äôve been to a few times that I absolutely love. Was there 3 times before I went in this most previous time, but always left early‚Äî 14 days was the most I‚Äôve done, but it‚Äôs a 28 day program. So this time I actually graduated, June 22nd-July 20th, and then I left, went home, and that night smoked bud, next day went to a meeting at that rehab I was at, then bought a bag‚Äî basically in the 4 days I was home I hit the ground running, not to mention I overdosed on the day I went back, July 24th. 

This time was cool too, so I stayed until August 11th and then went to a sober living part of the building, and it was fucking AMAZING. The set up there was a 3 day restriction, you could go outside and such but you can‚Äôt leave the premises of the building until your restriction was over, so that was awesome. Then on my 4th day being down there, I relapsed on dope... of fucking course..

So the day after I relapsed, long story short, one of my favorite counselors I was talking to from upstairs where I was at, who is in recovery (14 years), saw my pinned ass pupils and had them drop me, so their thing was either go back upstairs to Aspire, (The unit I was on before), or go back home. So I went back upstairs for 2 days, then I left because I felt as though I had learned about everything that I could, it just was the type of thing where I had to use the knowledge I had accumulated. 

So I‚Äôve been out about 10 days and just am fuckin up. I used for about a week up until Saturday and then went through baby withdrawals.

They have spread propaganda convincing generations that the uninsured poor are the reason healthcare premiums are so high.

When that gets proved wrong and They are pressed for the truth, they use their back up scapegoat topic research and development.  Do you trust corporations to create the drugs for humanity's future? How many drugs, vaccines, viral understanding, life saving procedures, and antibiotics have been buried and shelved because they develop drugs based on market need and profit margins? How much longer will you allow politicians to keep shooting down legislation and allow them to keep these monopolies on our health?

It took me 2 emails to get a number to set up a sales meeting to buy the active ingredient in a drug that costs 25k a month with insurance. 5 kilos would cost a .months pay for a full time 10 dollar an hour wage worker.  According to the estimated statistics, I could provide every diagnosed patient with daily medication for their life time.

United States laws make only one company a legal a seller. This medication keeps people alive. It's a necessity. Not a relief-comfort drug.

How long can patients afford 20k a month? They die without this medication.

How can a corporation price gouge these people? The CEO is on record smiling quoting ""supply and demand allows us to charge whatever we want. If they want to live, they have to pay""


This is sickening and lobbyists ensure this remains the status quo. Lining politicians pockets is how this whole system was created. Its why the govt spreads propaganda to keep the public arguing with each other instead of demanding change.

Our whole drug approval system needs over hauled. Even Cuba has a lung cancer vaccine first developed beginning in 1993.  Investment managers for,corporations are not interested in developing cures or vaccines. They cannot be trusted to make these decisions.

Their developments are decided by profit and there is hardly any profit in cures. Only drugs that manage symptoms so keep buying them for life.


Health care costs so much because of corporate greed. Nearly every other 1st world democracy can produce medication that costs chump,change or provided free. They also can afford R&D.


DO NOT BELIEVE THE CORPORATE PROPAGANDA. TAKE YOUR UNIVERSAL RIGHT FOR HEALTHCARE TO YOUR POLITICIANS FACE.

I'm utterly disgusted every time I hear another story about families going bankrupt and having to watch their loved one die.  Leaving their family a lifetime in debt as if the death wasn't enough.

Up until recently I had never thrown up on pills, almost did when I first vaped and was off norcos, realized quickly nicotine and opiates don‚Äôt mix. And the only other time I almost threw up was when I took my first blue oxy.

Getting to the point I know for some people taking any opiates makes them extremely nauseous and can cause them to throw up even. I‚Äôve never had that problem, until recently. For the last month of so every time I have taken any opiate, be it a hydro or oxy, I‚Äôve always felt sick to the stomach, so sick that I‚Äôve even yacked a few time because of it, and it all started recently

I don‚Äôt take opiates that often, maybe 2-3 times a month, 20-30 mg of either hydros or oxy. I thought maybe it was the lack of food because I don‚Äôt really eat before taking pills but I have always done that. I then decided to take 30mg of hydros last week and eat before and snacked a little during my high but I still felt nauseous. And I almost threw up the next morning

A story of why relapsing after ten years was the worse decision I‚Äôd ever made. It all started with that positive pregnancy test.,"I woke up this morning, slightly panicked. I thought I was back in my country of birth but I turned around and could feel the warmth of my boyfriend‚Äôs chest around my back, and his breath slowly tickling the back of my ear. I had put him and our family through so much. He has a child, they were broken up, she carried through and he took full responsibility. I had one too, mine was the product of trauma I thought I had resolved. I had full custody and raised that child alone, pushed through the post natal depression and learned to cherish life. Life at its most innocent and most vulnerable. We were happy alone, the little one and I. We both thrived in ways never thought possible for two and a half a years. I enjoyed my own company and that of what I had created looking at me softly and sweetly every night. I didn‚Äôt want anything to change. I had a social life, but didn‚Äôt drink. I didn‚Äôt want a companion, I had one for life whom I would teach to be independent, compassionate and loving, one that I would shield from the years of trauma I had undergone. 

It all changed that one night halfway across the world. Every time I‚Äôm in my partners arm the memories of that night keep flashing back. I wasn‚Äôt seeking anyone, and in the blink of an eye two lives became one. I knew who I truly was in that moment and didn‚Äôt have to hide it and didn‚Äôt feel the need to hide it. That same smell I wake up to every morning as I snuggle up tightly under the douna brings back electrifying feelings of a connection that can‚Äôt be explained. I‚Äôd never experienced love before. I‚Äôd experienced what I thought was love, masked as manipulation, gaslighting and abuse. 

We were at a big event, surrounded by mutual friends we had all known for years but nothing mattered anymore. The warmth of his lips, the way he gently stroked my hair, looked into my eyes, the way we writhed and wriggled all night long, not once letting go of each other. The intensity of those feelings grew between us every day and it continues to grow. 

But we‚Äôd been broken and healed in the past. We both had our coping mechanisms, I was more open about my emotions, he contained his. I knew something was off physically, I didn‚Äôt feel myself, I felt drained, nauseous, and at the end of a long day, I robotically went to the pharmacy and purchased a few tests. All five of them came up positive. We had a family, but not a biological one. I never wanted children, but I did now. The way he looked after my own child and his, both brought into the world without our consent. It was still a little early but we could make it work. We could make it work he said as he held my face tightly but gently, wiping the single tear slowly making its way down my face. We‚Äôd discussed it, but not this soon, just throwaway comments, baby names, the usual, we never expected it to happen this soon. 

Six weeks and three days. Perfectly healthy, I was told to come back in a few weeks. We had done this before but this time it was tears of elation and joy. The sickness started to get worse, much worse than my last one. He stayed up with me clenching my hands as I emptied out the bile and choked and the acidity, knowing this time it would be worth it. 

It was 3 am. I never leave my phone on loud but I had that evening, I quietly left the room and took the phone call. My whole world collapsed around me as my uncle told me my mother had been hiding cancer from me. It was serious. I don‚Äôt remember but I just screamed. She was my only parent. She had abused me, physically, emotionally and financially but she was just repeating the cycle. She was my only parent. Or so I thought. 

Baby was doing well. I had to leave the country soon to see my mother, and I had come to terms with it. The prognosis wasn‚Äôt as severe as first thought. I used breathing excercises to get myself to sleep as he was away on work. I felt this tingling pain down my side. I ignored it. It got gradually worse but I slept through it. 4 am. I woke up in a pool of blood. Alone. I called him. He told me to hang up and call and ambulance and he‚Äôd be on the first flight back. I couldn‚Äôt talk to him for 24 hours, just me alone in the worst hospital in the eastern suburbs as it happened to be the closest. I was sedated. I woke up and there he was. Nestled in between my neck, bloodshot eyes. How would we pay this month‚Äôs rent? We earned good money, but a huge tax bill had just hit. The rent had gone up. He lost the job and I couldn‚Äôt work. I felt like it was all my fault. He was distant. 60% of relationships ends after abortions or miscarriages, I was terrified. Out conversations were monotonous. I had never felt so alone and the hormones were playing tricks with my mind. 

That‚Äôs when I made the worst mistake I possibly could. I knew where to score, so I did. I knew it was the worst possible thing I could do. I never had any cravings over those ten years. I turned to the needle pretty fast. Things got nasty. We were arguing. I can‚Äôt remember half of it. It was all my fault and i had to change it. I went onto subuxone. My dose was too high and after a few months the side effects were killing me. I tried to taper until that fateful message came though. ‚ÄúShe died last night‚Äù. My sister, 20 years older than me had succumbed to ovarian cancer I went out for a long walk. It‚Äôs a safe area normally but those who hunt vulnerability can sniff it out a mile away. Out of nowhere. Three guys, two holding me down, one trying to grab my stuff, two trying to undress me. Two women across the scream saw and screamed for help, the men ran, my clothes has been torn but my bag was intact. I used all my strength possible, everything I had left in me to retain my dignity. I couldn‚Äôt tell how quick time was passing, but the NSW police and paramedics were here. Court is in mid September. Straight back to the H. 

I returned to my country of birth to see my mother shortly after that. She could tell I wasn‚Äôt well, but everything I told her, would be my fault, the miscarriage, the attempted mugging and rape, all of it. She would just berate me and make me feel like the useless piece of shit she had done a good job of making me feel all my life. The H was cheaper out there. It didn‚Äôt stop. My wife beating, alcoholic piece of shit dad who we thought was missing and presumed dead had died and been cremated a week before my sister. My use got heavier. The rest of my story can be found in my previous posts. 

I‚Äôm done. I woke up smiling for the first time this morning. Four days out of hospital. He told me it was going to be ok. It felt like that first night again as our bodies intertwined into one and he kissed me gently on the forehead. We made love like we normally do, selflessly, each taking care of each other. The mild WDs had started to kick in and the oxytocin was flowing through me. We held each other like we normally do and had a playful fight about who loved each other more. 

I think I‚Äôm going to start my bupe taper tomorrow. I‚Äôll see. I have a family. I have someone who loves me unconditionally and I‚Äôm learning to love myself unconditionally again. Never again. 

If anyone is struggling. Reach out to me. Don‚Äôt keep it to yourself. No matter what anyone tells you, you‚Äôre a human being who is worthy of love and respect. ",1535444532.0

I‚Äôm personally a chipper that uses 3x a week at night to get high, been that way for a year, and I got my schedule DOWN. 

I usually like taking my oxy at 8:30 PM - 10 PM. 20 minutes before I take my promethazine/other antihistamine. If I have some blow, i‚Äôll take that 10 mins before the antihistamine, so when i‚Äôm coming down the oxy will hit. 

So my schedule usually looks like this:

8:00 PM : hit some lines (if i have any coke)

8:10 : 75mg promethazine, coke has hit

8:25 : coke starts to comedown

8:30 : Opiates start to hit, bliss from here.

I call and ask if they're out there and they usually always say yes and to come thru. They're open from 7AM-9PM EVERY DAY (including weekends and holidays) like clockwork. They sell bags of boy (dope; my DOC) and raw if someone wants to buy raw. Also sell hard, soft, bars, bud, etc. Basically a one stop shop crew. Not always on the corner but that's why they got numbers. They usually out there tho in the summer, winter not so much. 

&#x200B;

They trust me enough that I got both the ""bosses"" (it's two brothers) of the crew's personal numbers as well as the standard number (some burner phone) they give their customers. Basically I get their bags because it's cheaper for me than raw and I don't buy anything else they sell since all my bread goes to dope. 

&#x200B;

So about their bags. They sell some of the BEST bags anyone would even find here on the west side and are always on point with quality. Shit they even never put fent in their bags (I've had lab tests done on my urine MANY times in my treatment center and I only ever had fent show up once and that was from another connect with shitty bags when I was desperate. Basically I'm saying their quality is on point.

&#x200B;

So today I went to grab and as usual I call and as for 8 bags and they say they'd give me ten. ""Shit, cool thanks"" I said, must be some new shit I thought. When I went there both the brothers were out which made me assume that it was new shit even more. After I grabbed I even noticed the bags were a different color than usual as well.

&#x200B;

Anyways when I got home I did a couple bags and HOLY SHIT. These bags were fire with LONG ass legs. So long that when I decided to do a third bag a few hours in they got me nodding out so hard I haven't experienced that in a LONG time. Basically had the BEST rush ever.

Really not impressed at all with this clinic I've been on the phone with my pharmacy and methadone clinic on and off most of today too and they still haven't resolved my script. The first two days without actually weren't that bad but today is absolutely abhorrent. Abysmal stomach feeling can't puke but feel like I need to the only way I could describe this is feeling like acid is sloshing around in my stomach. 

Probably doesn't help that methadone makes me nauseous naturally anyways. Just wish I could actually eat feels like there's a vault of empty space In my stomach lol. And it's windy and kind of ugly outside so evidently I'm absolutely freezing and also having cold sweats thank God the shits haven't started yet. 

I really despise methadone all it does is make me sick to my stomach when I'm on it so I can only eat a meal a day and generally puke bile once or twice everyday ( thankfully I don't have sexual side effects from it like alot of people). And as for subs I can't tolerate them I get a really bad drug rash from the naxalone.

Thankfully recently I did find a program in my city that offers slow release morphine orally the same way that methadone is offered and you can keep increasing to I think about 500mg to a gram depending on your habit. That and when I get takehomes in this program then I wouldn't always have to take orally and could boof/plug. I'm In Canada but where I am does not offer HAT ( heroin addiction treatment). They may be offering hydromorphone assisted maintenance in the future but currently isn't offered either in Alberta. Wondering if anyone thinks it would be a good idea to switch from methadone to morphine substituted treatment.   

Update: Fucking finally I'm not sick anymore I got a dose. Still frustrating as hell though. And my dose was 85mg and because of the clinics fuck up making me miss two days of dosing I only got 65mg today...lame. Positive is at least because I haven't dosed in 2 days I have a bit of a buzz off this 65mg.",1535402545.0

I received an unneeded rx for hydrocodone/acetaminophen syrup after dental surgery and last night decided to try to get high.‚Äã

I'm aware of acetaminophen toxicity - I calculated that the entire bottle of syrup was not anywhere near a toxic dose. I drank a little over half the bottle of syrup, which I estimate was about 37mg of hydrocodone.

I chilled out and shitposted on Reddit for an hour or so, then got in bed. Didn't feel ""high"" so much as just relaxed. I could feel that my heart and breathing rate were significantly lower than usual.‚Äã

I got up at my normal time and felt super SUPER tired and incredibly nauseous. It's now about 14 hours after I took the syrup, the nausea has diminished a bit, but I could still lay down and take a nap right here on the floor. Everything I've read suggested that the drug should be out of my body by now, but I feel very unlike my usual state.

Is this normal? Is 37mg a high dose for a 125 lb woman? And is there anything I can do to make myself feel better for the rest of the day?

2) Will I get anything recreationally out of them? I usually do a point of mediocre dope snorted to get high. To give a better idea of my tolerance, 60mg of oxy would get me buzzed, though I could prob handle a bit more.

Ive had chronic pain for quite a few years now. Also my immune system sucks and the only indicator of that is elevated levels for lupus like 9 years ago but not enough to call it the disease. I decided it was time to get off suboxone a few months ago. I wanted to see what my baseline was and I hated the effects it had on me. So I did it, it was hard but survived. Meanwhile I had a staph infection which wasnt taken care of after going to the dr like 5 times. They just kept putting me on antibiotics. Worst case scenario happened, got c-diff. Was hospitalized for a week and they finally opened up the staph. Two months later, still recovering from c-diff and staph is worse so now I have a nurse coming every other day to repack my wound. Through all this I havent asked for pain medicine at all. In fact the surgeon argued with me in the hospital about needing something for pain so I took a few norco and that was it. Now Im having a lot of pain in my arm after dressing changes for 12 hours after. They will do nothing about this. My aunt is a nurse and was shocked they didnt prescribe pain relief for dressing changes at least. I had to go to er this weekend they did blood cultures and gave me another antibiotic which Im worried will give me cdiff again and 6 Tylenol with codeine. She did give me iv morphine and is the only one that seemed to care about the pain. This wasnt hurting for the last two months and now its unbearable. I was supposed to see the same surgeon today, they called me and said dont come in we cant give you medicine take Tylenol. This is the same doctor that wanted me to take medicine in the hospital. I was like what? Ok well thats not my only concern. They still wouldnt see me. He just stares at me when I talk to him and ask for advice about staph infection and which dr to see for other symptoms. Like seriously what the hell. First of all you have to see like 3/4 different doctors for the same issue. US healthcare sucks. And then as soon as you say you have pain people are suspicious instead of actually helping. Im like no wonder so many people just try to find a connect. Its insane. Ive refused pain meds many times, i dont want to take opiates on a schedule anymore. Anyone else have these issues? I know Ive read some stories on here about pain management horrors. Is this because of new regulations? My visiting nurse looked at me like I was drug seeking as Im yelling while they pack the wound. Like your an idiot woman. Im just done with it all and venting. Im too young for this shit but i suppose Im not the only one. If anyone read this, thanks for letting me vent.

Waiting for the methadone WDs to kick in before I start my bupe taper.,"As the lucidity set in, I realised what I had done. I realised that this wasn‚Äôt ten years ago and I wasn‚Äôt that teen who could conquer all her demons and burn all her bridges without consequence. The trauma I had tried to suppress was bubbling to the surface so quickly yet quietly. It was Friday evening. My boyfriend came home, and I was making a cup of tea. Suddenly I couldn‚Äôt see. I couldn‚Äôt speak. There were ants in front of me everywhere. The room was full of ants. I was told to go lie down but I couldn‚Äôt walk. I was carried somewhere. I went to lie down but it wasn‚Äôt my room. This wasn‚Äôt my house. All these people were around me. Was this it? The afterlife. It was pretty boring. It was bright. 

I woke up. 

‚ÄúYou have severe PTSD‚Äù 

I couldn‚Äôt open my mouth. 

‚ÄúYour NSW health records told us you relapsed a few months ago. You are on a methadone taper. Do you know what year it is? Do you know where you are?‚Äù 

Nothing. 

Just my boyfriend crying so much that I could feel his emotional pain throughout my body. 

‚ÄúDo you know what your name is?‚Äù 

Nothing. 

‚ÄúHer Mum‚Äôs got cancer. We had a miscarriage. Her sister died. She found out her dad who was a wife beating alcoholic died and was cremated a week before her sister died. She got mugged and borderline raped before the police arrived‚Äù he blubbered. 

They gave me an injection, I passed out and he snuggled up into my arms. 

I woke up. It was 6 am. We walked the five minutes home as he held me and we fell asleep. 

I never sought him out. I was living a sober life and had achieved amazing things in those ten years. He had also undergone trauma in his life, we had both been in unbelievably fucked up abusive relationships and both had children from those relationships. We weren‚Äôt codependent, we wouldn‚Äôt use anything together except the odd bit of coke once every four months. I didn‚Äôt even drink. I love his child like my own and he loves mine like his own but they‚Äôre being taken care of and in good hands while I heal. We take care of each other. He taught me what life and a healthy relationship was. He taught me what a normal family dynamic was. 

I was happy before I met him and he was happy before I met him. I didn‚Äôt rely on him for my happiness. He just added to it. His beautiful dimples.

*The introduction*

The year was 2012, I was in high school, I found some pills in the back of a drawer. I knew enough about pain pills from hearing my older neighborhood friends talk about them. I knew they had *something* in them that would get me high. My dad had mouth/jaw surgery, but it was over a year before. These had sat unused, as he hated the nausea they caused. I looked some info up on the internet, and everything said it was pretty much safe to take. I dug more around the house and found two more bottles, these ones full and semi hidden. 70 total 10mg hydrocodone/ 325mg acetaminophen. And then about 20 total 7.5mg norcos. The bottles were semi dusty, I knew they had been forgotten about. I popped one 10mg and within a couple hours I knew I would really like them.
I hoarded them all.

*The young entrepreneur*

I waited weeks before I even touched another one. I didn‚Äôt want to be high around my parents and them notice the pills were gone. They‚Äôd put two and two together. I told a few of my class mates I had found some pills, interest grew and some people asked what they were like. Some wanted to buy a few. I had some friends, some of the older kids from school who sold drugs, so I asked what I should charge if I had a script. They basically said $6-$10 for the 10s and $4-$7 for the 7.5s, depending on how much I liked the person. As I had not paid anything, my profit would come no matter what. So I sold for as much as possible in every situation. Made a pretty penny. Did a couple. That‚Äôs when I fell in love the first time; my god look at this money. My fourteen year old self was astounded.

*Now your scripts you found are out, now what?*

Those older kids I was friends with, one had an ability to grab Percocet scripts. I had my money I made, and bought three Percocet scripts. A total of 90 10mg oxycodone/ 325 acetaminophen. I would owe him some money when I made it, but again I sold them so quick I only had the chance to do a few. I did this a couple times. One of my favorite hobbies.

*You sit on top of your throne of sins*

Eventually I went over my connects heads and met their plugs. My friends were generous enough to put me on. They saw my potential. I was good enough for a couple months. Saved money. Didn‚Äôt do my own drugs too much. But eventually, ran into relationship problems, and I grew nasty drug habits as a result. Switched the Percocet for Oxy 20s. I had it on tap, and I didn‚Äôt worry about making money, I knew it would come. I had made enough addicts, now one more in myself. I grew less reliable, they put up with it, or else they started to get sick. 
I started to get sick. I had to slow down, most of them sped up.

*Only thing that makes the voices stop*

My head, has always been plagued by insecurities, anxiety, mood swings, unwarranted aggression, violent depression, sadism and narcissism; a sick mind medicated and sedated by a warm comforting chemical. Docile and seemingly stable, my family thought I was doing better in life. My peers, thought I was like two people. There was the one who was using, and had his dose that day. He was funny, charismatic. The one you wanted to spend time with. The one who was calm and confident.

Then there was the sober one, the one who collected debts. The one who made their hair stand up. The one they hated picking up from. Scary and sober, unstable, bat shit insane. 

*Head in the clouds, fuzzy thoughts, puddles in my brain. My sanity loves to jump in puddles*

The year is 2015, three years of heavy poly drug use, began to take its toll on my mind. I began to think how Yoda talks. I wanted to quit using all drugs. The event that made me decide was a shamanic type trip, induced by making tea with 2 grams of shrooms, cooling it. I dropped in 100 mg of MDMA crystals into the tea, and I put 50ug of LSD onto my tongue. During the trip I felt my body so polluted that I was very sick and threw up after giving thought to how I felt and what caused that. My own choices to over do recreational drugs. I weened off opioids over the course of a month. Cocaine I was able to stop without problem. Quitting amps made me narcoleptic for awhile. Dissociative‚Äôs really were the crux of the problem I‚Äôd say as far as mental scattering. Benzos and opioids made me increasingly nauseous and hung over the next day. I took it as my body supporting my decisions. 

*The journey so far afterward*

Every once in awhile, if I get the ability, I will indulge and buy a few Oxy 20s. I will also wet my beak with other substances, but this is the opiates sub. It‚Äôs been three years and I want to live life like I used to. I can‚Äôt, if I was half as high as I am now at work, I couldn‚Äôt focus on anything. But damn I miss this warm feeling of euphoria. My life now seems so boring to what I used to do, the people I hung out with. Over the past few months I‚Äôve found myself slipping back into that lifestyle. Riding around the strip, visiting the different plugs and partying hard. When I used to be involved with this scene, fake pills weren‚Äôt the norm. Pressies weren‚Äôt everywhere. The candies were real, and always hit, always safe. It‚Äôs so dangerous now it seems, and more expensive and harder to find legit stuff. 

Please be safe when you go out and play, I‚Äôd like for you to be able to come out and play tomorrow. Look both ways before you cross the street, test your drugs. Don‚Äôt sell fake shit.",1535361294.0

I think my brain is fucked up pls help,"Hey everyone I have a few questions about some shit that I need help with. Sorry in advance for the wall of text.

I've been addicted to opiates for about three or four years now. I was on subs for about a year and then I had a big relapse last year. My habit wasn't as big as some, but I was doing 5-6 oxy 30s a day. I've switched from oxy to subs way too many times within the past year and I just had 3 months clean from everything but subs. With that being said, this weekend I decided to have a little fun.


Within the last month or so I've been experiencing some issues where the subs have been giving me anxiety. I've been snorting them because I have an intranasal fetish (I realize that I need to stop doing it because it's just a waste), and I don't think I'm even taking 1mg a day (I've been trying to ween myself down). The lines I'm doing are extremely small, but sometimes I do get ""high"" from it. I dose the same size line about 3 times a day, which is MAYBE .25mg per dose. It may be a tad more/less. If I don't take enough, or if I wait too long to take the dose then I start feeling kinda weird and shitty. I know most of you have experienced the pre-withdrawal fogginess, and the restless feeling in the pit of your stomach. I thought subs had a pretty long half life so should I even be going into withdrawal so soon? There have been times where I've woken up in the middle of the night with restless legs.

Anyway, I did two of those lines on Friday: the first was around 9am and then again at like...11:30-11:45am. I had to dose a second time because the first line didn't really do anything. Later that evening I bought three oxy 30s around 7:30pm, dosed 7.5mg (just to be safe, lots of fakes going around) and I felt it. It wasn't strong or anything, but I was feeling kinda nice, and then I took another 7.5mg a little while later. I've dosed like this pretty much all weekend and I've felt it every single time, and now I only have one left which I'm saving for tomorrow.

I'm not gonna lie and say that this weekend hasn't been nice, because it has. Subs have been doing some weird shit to me lately (lots of anxiety and lots of brain fog/depersonalization) so getting some relief and getting high has been wonderful. I promised my fiancee that this is a one-off and that I'm getting back on subs once the last one is gone. 

As for questions, has anyone else experienced this with subs? Why is my tolerance so fucking low? Is it because I've been snorting them? Is my induction period gonna be bad or will the withdrawal be pretty mild since I wasn't using too much? Should I not take the subs and see how it goes for a couple of days?

I know this post is kinda all over the place, but I just want some advice. Tell me whatever you wanna tell me or whatever you think. Everything sucks right now and I don't wanna do this shit anymore. ",1535336355.0

I'm currently on Suboxone after having been addicted to Fentanyl for just over a year. I'm happy to say I'm 6 months and 1 week clean. I started at a very high dose of Suboxone and have now managed to taper down to 0.2-0.4mg per day. However I have a surgery coming up in a couple of weeks where they will be putting me under with anaesthetic. Would the Suboxone in my system affect the anaesthetic? I really don't want to wake up halfway thru surgery or something like that but I'm also cautious about mentioning my Suboxone use to the anaesthetist as it's not prescribed to me and also he may put me on some sort of nation-wide drug addict registrar which would be far from ideal considering how far I've come since my Fentanyl using days.

https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/92k18g/why_opanas_is_dangerous/
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 There was a lot of back and forth on people saying my math was wrong, users who stated that there was no way oral Opanas were stronger than Percocets oral, personal experience not adding up to my conclusions, etc. I am back now, after doing some more research, to give a more in depth walk through of what the actual truth on the potency is. To start, I will give a recap on what information I was referring to, and the point I was trying to get across:

First, the base comparison we start with is the ratio of potency when comparing Oxycodone to Oxymorphone, which many people throw around is a 2:1 ratio. 2mg of Oxycodone equals 1mg of Opana. This fact is true. HOWEVER, people forget to add the next bit of CRUCIAL information with that ratio, which is that this 2:1 value is when comparing ORAL administration. This value is only true when you are trying to calculate oral doses. Next we will look into the bio-availability of different ROA(routes of administration):

Oral Absorption: Pharmaceutical Ratio: [2mg Oxycodone = 1mg Oxymorphone]
Oxycodone= ~87% efficiency
Oxymorphone= ~12% efficiency
This means that Opanas are DOUBLE the strength of Percocets, with only 1/10th of the total administered dose even being metabolized. Oxycodone, with almost 90% of the total dose being absorbed, is still only HALF of the potency of Oxymorphone.
---------------------------------------

Intranasal Absorption(snorting):
Oxycodone= ~47% efficiency
Oxymorphone= ~42% efficiency
(This is where I start to lay out my point. Also, keep in mind I am getting these values from simply looking up the bioavaliability of these opiates with different ROA's online on health websites and medical journals. Anyone can find any of the values I start with by taking a couple minutes to Google search.)
---------------------------------------
As shown, Oxymorphone has now jumped in it's total absorption from ~12% orally, to 42% when snorted. This is a 350% increase in potency. Let us use an example just to see how crazy this value is. I will start with us scoring a 10mg K71 Pill(Instant-Release Oxymorphone). This is one of the very few Oxymorphone pills that can be crushed effectively. To compare:
-If swallowed, only 1.2mg of 10mg will be active in the body. However, that 10mg Opana will be as strong as swallowing 20mg of Percocet. At 87% oral absorption, 17.4mg of Oxycodone will be active in the body. Using the 2:1 strength ratio, 10mg Opana = 20mg Percocet. after calculating the absorbed weight, we see that 1.2mg of metabolized Opana EQUALS 17.4mg of metabolized Percocet. That is a 14:1 active chemical ratio(14mg absorbed Percocet=1mg absorbed Opana).

Now we can move onto snorting. Let us take that same 10mg Opana IR pill again. Instead of swallowing the pill with only a 12% efficiency rate, we will snort it to get 42% efficiency. Snorting the Opana gives us 4.2mg that is metabolized. Let me explain that to you again; 42% absorption VS 12% absorption! 4.2mg / 1.2mg = 3.5X increase in potency from the SAME DOSE just by snorting the bastard. So what does this mean? Well, Snorting all of that 10mg IR Opana would be the same as ORALLY TAKING 35mg of Opana. Now, remember that 2:1 ratio? That is the absolute ratio for oral Oxycodone vs oral Oxymorphone. I will input that into the string of steps in our calculation. Now:

10mg Opana(Intranasal) X 3.5(value snorted vs oral) = 35mg Opana(Oral)

35mg Opana(Oral) X 2(oral value Opana vs Percocet) = 70mg Oxycodone(Oral)

Now, let us compare snorting Oxycodone instead of orally taking it. The Absorption rate of Oxycodone goes down from 87% absorption orally, to 47% intranasally. This is a 46% reduction in potency(That sucks. Kids, always eat your Percocets!) We now continue our math:

70mg Oxycodone(Oral) X 0.46(Reduced efficiency value) = 32.2mg(amount that is lost from non-absorption) - 70mg(Oral Oxycodone initial weight) = -37.8mg Oxycodone(Insufflated)

Ignore the negative sign; 70mg of Oral Oxycodone becomes only a 37.8mg dose when snorted. Divide both values, and we find that:

 1.85mg Snorted Oxycodone = 1mg Oral Oxycodone, OR 1.85mg(Snorted):1mg(Oral)

Finally, in order to get the same potency of 70mg of oral Oxycodone, one must snort about 130mg of Percocet up the nose!

10mg Opana(Snorted) will now be equivelent to: =====

35mg Opana(Oral)
70mg Percocet(Oral)
and 130mg Percocet(Snorted)

There you go. I hope this has became clear to understand how powerful Oxymorphone becomes when one decides to snort the contents. It is easy to see how people are overdosing on Opanas with little tolerance.

As always, feedback is much appreciated! Stay safe out there :)

Now, I've sent myself to my mothers in the countryside to keep me from scoring and shooing up, so I have no way to get dope. My strategy has been to buy some co-codamol from the pharmacy. They are 32 tablets, 8mg codeine /  400mg paracetamol. I bought 2 boxes. Earlier I did a cold water extraction with one box, drank the codeine (which was FUCKING AMAZING btw). I've been popping pills from the other box regularly. 

My hope is that this will make me test positive, without actually doing dope, in the assumption that it will metabolise into morphine in my body and come out as such on the test. 

Am I on the right lines here? Will this work? 

>Please forget your ""if you're 32 days clean, why do you want suboxone?"" comments. I just do, to keep me from relapsing.

9aispy,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9aispy/variety/,2,https://redd.it/9aispy,lazerberriez,Variety,"I love doing as many different drugs as possible. I'm at about 90 right now. I love to compare all there nuanced differences. One class I hardly explored was opioids, only having done hydros, oxys, trams, and more recently codeine a limited amount of times. Recently I decided to say fuck it and just order all the ones that caught my interest. I got tapentadol, opium, hydromorphone, methadone, heroin, and oxymorphone, doing most only once (except tapentadol, that shit is so cheap its impossible to not get a g worth of pills). It was a fun and very risky experiment I did on myself since I am most addictively inclined toward opioids over anything else (addicted to kratom, I know, pussy shit; also stims don't have much of a hold on me, I have fun and then reach a point where I'm done and give away whatever I have left). Anyways I have found the differences between opioids to not be that interesting. I mainly just noticed differences with duration, euphoria, and level of sedation. Anyways Imma rank em anyways, keep in mind that I don't IV and don't wanna cross that line.  

hydrocodone- seems to be the basic bitch of opioids. Nothing really amazing when it comes to euphoria and just doesn't hit the spot that well. I give it a 7/10 because any opioid is good to some extent  

tramadol - was fun, I enjoyed the duration and energy of it but did not like the nausea. 7.1/10  

hydromorphone - I boofed it, it was nice but went away fast. I also didn't really know my tolerance so I played it safe and didn't get that rush people love it for. It was very short though and I didn't think it was worth the cost (pills ain't cheap man) 7.5/10

tapentadol - alright euphoria and decent duration and not too sedating. I found it quite nice. I also like the kinda dissociating feelings it can bring with light visuals, definetely a more unique feeling opioid. 7.5/10  

Fentanyl - forgot to mention this one earlier, I got it before surgery at the hospital and since I was able to get pretty high I'm counting it. It made me feel quite warm and nice, I was buzzing from it for a good couple hours. I still didn't have that awesomeness of some other opioids I've done. 7.8/10  

Codeine - I really like codeine, probably cause I'm a noob but it gave me a level of relaxation that I've not experienced on other opioids. It was very laid back and just nice, although its a bit lacking after the come up. It's also the only opioid that made me itch a slow moving red rash that started at the top of my head and slowly moved down my body til I took a benadryl. I looked like I was tweaking with how much I was scratching myself.

Opium - I liked this one quite a bit. There's nothing like smoking some opium off foil with the gang. I enjoyed it smoking, it gave me a weird very dreamlike state and I felt very relaxed and comfy. It wasn't too sedating either. I liked it even better when eating it, although smoking a couple cigs on it with some kratom made me throw it. Gave me the warm and fuzzies before that though. Solid 8/10.  

Methadone - I really liked methadone. It was nothing crazy with euphoria but was still one of the better ones I felt. It was a little sedating. What I really liked was the long duration. I was high all fucking day and when I throw kratom on top my face started flushing (I fucking love the flushing) like when I first started drinking that green shit. 8.5/10  

Oxycodone - Now oxycodone really hits the spot. It just hits you right in the right spot of your receptors if ya feel me. I only did it a couple time but I found it to be very enjoyable. That's all I have to say, sorry I'm not very good at this and am just stimmed out and thought rating all the opioids I did would be fun cause fuck it why not amirite y'all. 9/10 cause you deserve it oxy  

Heroin - I smoked it. Made me feel really gooey, one of the most magical feeling opioids and had an afterglow that lasted all day keeping me in a good mood. I see why this is alot of people's favorite. 10/10  

Oxymorphone - Oh my god... I never felt like I did when I did opana before. That was the euphoria that people chase for the rest of their opioid careers and holy shit it was so good. Just a freight train of pure euphoria ran me over. I also had to make sure I was breathing enough and was ready to have my buddy drive to the walgreens to get some nalaxone because I kept getting higher and higher for like 90 minutes. I took 35mg ER split into pieces and didn't know how much the time release would affect how it hit me and what would be safe even though I knew the conversion of potency from oxycodone to oxymorph. BTW sorry guys, don't hate me for eating it, I was just too lazy to put in the work to break the abuse protection, plus god knows I didn't need that much opana after how awesome it was. It was the first opioid to give me legit craving for a few days after one use. It was just perfect, I can only imagine slamming it (don't wanna know until I'm on my deathbed, I don't trust myself enough with that). 11/10   

Anyways my little adventure is over. I am still content with just having kratom in my life cuz I would like to avoid those withdrawals and the complete grip opioids can have on your life. I shall not order any more internet opioids because they are just too easy to get. Anyways I hope somebody enjoyed this, I spent way too long on it lol

Today I came clean to my mom who told me last month that if I used again I would be put out on the street. For the past month I have used in secret, sold literally everything I have except for a couple changes of clothes and my bed at her house, I have stolen from her, pawned my engagement ring, and all the other jewelry I have. I have realized anyone ‚Äúin the game‚Äù I thought was my friend was not and have been used by every single one of them. The best past week I have wanted to kill myself every time I wasn‚Äôt high (which was getting harder and harder to do) so I decided yesterday was my last day. Today has been complete hell except for the fact that I had a 10th or a suboxone left. I‚Äôm in pain, eyes watering, nose running, extremely tired, depressed, anxious, goosebumps, sweats, and stomach cramps. But I am making this the last time I go through this shit. I cannot go on living everyday either suicidal or selling stolen stuff for the high. 

I have previously had alcohol and benzo addiction and went to treatment for a month and came home and stayed clean for 1.5 years. I was able to finish my Masters and get a good job and live on my own. I would go to 12 step meetings a few times a week and had a sponsor I worked the 12 steps with. 

Then I was introduced to heroin. The first time I tried it my boyfriend at the time shot me up. That was in October. I have been using on and off since then. It usually takes about .3 to get me high. So since October I have been to treatment 2 times, sober living once, tried opioid maintenance therapy with suboxone, and 12 steps. I could not stay clean. The longest run I‚Äôve had was 85 days. I have lost 3 apartments, 1 job, a brand new car, all my furniture, all my electronics, all my jewelry, most of my clothes, and a lot of friends. I have nothing left to give heroin. 

If anyone out there is willing to help me get through this it would be much appreciated. I just need someone to talk to (and I do see a therapist weekly but she really doesn‚Äôt understand 1st hand what this is like). Any books, tv shows, movies, etc that can help me through this process would be much appreciated. Everyone I know is DONE with me (except my mom being willing to give me one last chance). I just need to know that it gets better and that it is possible. 

A little backstory: I am diagnosed with narcolepsy, depression, panic disorder, anxiety disorder, and ADD. The heroin really helped me self medicate the depression, anxiety, and panic attacks. The heroin also surprisingly helped a lot with my narcolepsy (which you can search online about the studies being done with opiates and narcolepsy to see that it isn‚Äôt total bullshit). 

Any help would be much appreciated! ",1535311426.0

But then since Monday I've been having numbness in that left hand, on that side, it basically is numb from my wrist to the tip of my fingers, from my pinky to my ring finger, middle to thumb and down is not numb. So half of my hand, if that makes sense. 

I thought it was numbness from killing my left arm veins and loss of circulation or something until talking to my girlfriend who said prolonged numbness would only be cased by nerve damage, which reminded me I hit a nerve right where it's numb last Sunday. 

This happen to anyone else? How long can I expect this to last?",1535296980.0

Risk of taking?,"Okay so I‚Äôm in the hospital in a normal room. It‚Äôs my last night, getting checked out to go home tomorrow. 

Next to my hospital bed there‚Äôs a small dresser/nightstand with three drawers.  The bottom two are empty but the top drawer has 5-6 unopened sharps. 
No idea why they are there. 

In the top drawer there is an empty box of IV Labetalol HCI. I believe it was what they were injecting in my stomach to help prevent blood clots, as I also have those weird things on my calf‚Äôs/lower legs that inflate to increase blood flow to prevent blood clots.

In the same top drawer there are also 6 unopened sterile 
‚ÄúMagellan 1/2mL Insulin Safety Syringes. ‚Äú

Below that text, in italics, the wrapping says ‚ÄúPermanent Needle‚Äù

Below that if says:

‚Äú29 G x 1/2‚Äù (0.33 mm x 1.3 cm)

To the right of the top-ish text is also says in small font ‚ÄúFor use with U-100 insulin only‚Äù


I have no easy way of getting of getting sharps in my state unless I go a state over to a pharmacy and they still give hassle, Iv never done it, just friends who needed sharps.

They haven‚Äôt moved. Since the day I got in the room, tomorrow will be my third day admitted, nothing in the drawer has moved. 
I‚Äôm in the hospital due to an asthma attack the weather triggered. I‚Äôm not prescribed any opioids and haven‚Äôt received any while here.

But, at home I do have some fire id love to bang. I usually have to use insufflation as my ROA due to my inability/laziness to get sharps. But it seems right now I have an opportunity to take one or two.

I‚Äôm just confused why they are even there, they are completely sterile and would obviously work for IV ROA of dope.
What kind of risk am I looking at putting 1-3 in my bag before checkout? There‚Äôs no cameras in this room and like I said they‚Äôve just sat there since I got in this room.

TL;DR 
In hospital for few days due to weather related asthma. In the top drawer of my beside dresser there are unopened sterile insulin 29 G x 1/2‚Äù sharps. What is the ultimate risk in pocketing s couple of these before I get discharged tomorrow?

Saturday and Sunday. The hard days at work. A little reward for not doing any stupid shit throughout the week. Surprisingly enough I've been able to stick to those two days, haven't slipped up past that. And because I give myself a solid 5 days off in a row I never get even a hint of WD. 


Recently my guy stopped getting Zubsolvs and started getting methadone. He's been selling my the 40mg wafer. Last week I got 1, and took the whole thing. Didn't feel much. So this week I got 4, and today I took 1 3/4, for 70mg. I enjoyed that, and wasn't too crazy. But I don't have a lot of experience with methadone and have a few questions. 


So I know the half life is very long. Will my prior strategy of 2 days on, 5 days off work with methadone? Work to the point of not having any physical WD? That is how the bupe was for me, and if I start developing physical WDs after giving myself 5 days off I am going to have to stop taking it. I won't risk physical WDs/


Second question is about dosing. Like I said, today I took 70mg. I enjoyed that. My plan was to take the other two wafers I have tomorrow (80mg). However when reading up on methadone redosing I am reading a lot of people warning about redosing. That even 24 hours later there can still be so much in your body that you can OD. So is redosing a day later not a good idea?


tl;dr 

Question 1 - If I take methadone for 2 days and then give myself 5 
days off and do that every week is the 5 days off enough to ensure I never get physical WD.

Question 2 - Should I not redose the second day since it stays in my system for so long? Ideally I would take 80mg Saturday morning, and 80mg Sunday morning. However if that effectively means I am on 160mg on Sunday after taking that days dose it may not be the best idea.

Is there an issue if there's stuff in the syringes? It's impossible to squeeze every single drop out and I've used a few for bloodletting so they're stained in blood.

I don't know how to do this, help me.

Someone had finally paid her for a car she sold them and she hadn't made it to the bank in a week to deposit the money.

I know I'll get a fire ass check in two weeks but I gotta survive in the meantime right. So I'm like I need a loan. Lol I gotta pay my car payment, my girl is paying our insurance, and mom is paying the house bills and shit. She's like how much do you need? I'm like well 400 dollars will probably help me out cause my first pay check is gone to bills whenever that hits and I still gotta make it two weeks and gas and shit. So shes like I gotcha. And she counts me out 4 bills. So I got enough money to pay my car payment, got a gram, and got my gas and juice covered for the next two weeks. Talk about a blessing for real. I gotta make the G stretch out but wow. I was honestly shocked. She's like don't worry about paying me I know you're good for it, you're family ya know. I was amazed the whole way back.

I would like to ask you something: do many of you use opiates and the pleasures that they deliver as a replacement for sexual activity, or as a substitute that made up for (or more than made up for!) a non-existent or pitiful sex life and all the anxiety that that brings?  
Personally, I would go as far to say that opiated pleasures are erotic...it's generally accepted that they are sensual, but erotic? For me, definitely that too...especially at the beginning before the magic starts to go and you're saying, ""uh oh"" but that's a different story. I like the sound of 'opiosensual'.   
For male opiate/opioid users like myself, the sensual roles are reversed...these compounds are the lovemakers, and people like me are the receivers, the ones who can lie back and relax without anxiety whilst 'the other' does all the work.  
I'm no MGTOW, but I do not have the motivation to chase women for sex...and back when I did and was successful, I came out the other side thinking, ""that sure did take some time and energy"". I questioned the whole charade, even if the sex was good and the lady was beautiful: everyone's breath smells in the morning though, right?   
So for those who are romantically inactive, did you fall further and further out of it as the substances lowered your testosterone? Did you renounce sex with humans first, and then go on to these, and perhaps other substances too, to fill the sensual void left behind? Was it a really quick turnaround in a ""wow, these are better than sex! Opiates are my new love and I'm not looking back!"" kind of way? For me, opiates blew sex and masturbation away completely...and not masturbating or having sex intensifies psychedelic trips anyway, which is advantageous. I'd rather abstain and use the saved-up sexual energy to hallucinate that I'm having energy intercourse with a goddess anyway, than ride the endless merry-go-round of dating.  
Eros takes on many forms, the not-so-humble poppy of pleasure being one of them. I wrote in one of my notebooks: Eros ---> sex, erotic dreams and nocturnal emissions, opiates, celibacy and semen retention, erotic psychedelic trips, eunuchs, creativity.  
So, are you opiosensual who is in love with the poppy? Are you opiosensual but still have a romantic life? Or is it another mundane thing that does not deserve this new name that I've given it?

This is just a thought and wondering if any of you think the same thing or different?

So in the States and Canada there is an epidemic of F. In my town we call them Death Dealers. Thousands of people have died in B.C and Alberta just this year in Canada and by the stats this is the worst drug epidemic of all time Right Now. Holy fuck what the hell happened? I have a theory on how it started ( just a thought if im wrong i wont be surprised).

&#x200B;

So 8 Years ago in the U.S Oxycontin was discontined(2014 in Canada) and Docs were put on notice by the media witchhunt and Gov morons to be more stingy with Opoids(pill mills being shut down which fed most of the country  Pharma safe gear). So you have all these people used to getting there fix from a safe opoid of there choosing at a not bad price due to volume of product being put out.

&#x200B;

To put it simply i imagine this created quite a vacum and drought of opoids as time went on. Without missing a step the death dealers moved there F into pressed O.Cs and Roxys. Heres a situation-Youve been out of O.Cs for 2 days and sick, depressed and most of all bored, you call your neighbourhood Dealer"" No Oxy but i do have this other stuff and it will blow your head off"" without knowing the danger as F wasn""t mainstream back then you have a line. Without realizing you just done the most dangerous and addictive opiate in the world. Im sure many roads didnt go to well with the switch from Pharma Safe to pressed 10000x More potent than morphine.

As the drought of opoids continued the flood of F Grew. Opoid prices went up which pushed users to H that prolly has F in it. Perfect storm for the users of North America. Fast foward to today what is everybodys thoughts. Did the Gov stupidly set up a lay up for one of the worst epidemics in History?  The Cat is out of the bag clearly but any ideas on how to help and do some damage control? Pharm Heroin clinics perhaps? Pharmacies giving free F test kits? 

&#x200B;

In my opinion Adults should have the right to choose what they put in their bodys, and that all drugs should be legalized and be able to buy safely in a pharmacy OTC.  Would addicts have to rob if they could afford their gear for 5$ a day from a pharm instead of spending 100+ a day?

I have found some 120mg and 200mg Sevre-Long morphine pills.

Sevre-Long = extended release (48 hours lasting effect).

Does someone know how to unretard them?

 I just wanted to ""unextend"" like 30mg. I tried to ""melt"" them in hot water and drink it. The effect wasn't that strong and felt not like 30mg.

Is crushing them an option?

So. About me. I‚Äôve been heroin-free for over 8 years now, and meth-free for 11. I‚Äôm honestly a tweaker by nature but heroin found its way into my life due to a series of very unfortunate events. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love tar like a brother, but it‚Äôs not my main jams. I really only like heroin because it shuts down my PTSD and makes me not have to live in this reality. I do not appreciate this reality due to many factors, and many traumas in my life. I crave heroin most when I‚Äôm in pain. 

At the moment I‚Äôm facing many things from my very sordid past and it‚Äôs just really sucking. However my present life is actually not too bad. I have a lot going for me, which is the main reason I haven‚Äôt cracked and used h in the past 8 years. I‚Äôm doing it more out of fear of losing everything, going to jail, losing housing, ruining my relationship (he‚Äôs very special), losing my job (which I love dearly), rather than actually caring if I‚Äôm off heroin.

So it was all I could take today not to cold cop off the various potentials I could have hit up just on the streets today. I live in a socially and economically depressed area.

The past several hours have been a bit of an odd blur. The sort of temporal shift one might only find in a Nolan film. I was all set with my buffet of garbage food. Enjoyed a full bag of H which I'd picked up earlier from the dboy. It hit rather hard, and wasn't long before I knew enjoying my eats and treats was going to require more coordination than I readily possessed. 

Somehow I'd acquired two cheeseburgers and a chocolate milkshake from McDonald's. Oh, that sweet tasty shake went down ever so smooth. I now realize the cheeseburgers are simple overkill, but I musn't waste food.

As I nodded in and out trying to get the burger to my mouth, I enjoyed an episode of breakingbad. Every so often I'd come to with my burger resting against my chest, me rocking it to sleep just as I'd nodded myself off to la la land. I was able to eventually get the burger to my mouth, though chewing was a whole new project of its own. So thirsty. Where's my powerade. Oh, poured out on the floor. You know, I'm just going to put the burger down for a sec. and check my phone.

Oh, my buddy is going to call me to catch up on how I've been. About 20 minutes later I'd composed the text: ""Nah, rain check I'm having a sick and then I'll hollar at you when I find it"". Send. 

I better get the rest of my powerade, I'm thirsty. [INSERT PERIOD OF BLACKNESS]

I awake three hours later on my courch with quite the belly ache. Not one of a stew of vomit churning about, but more of a abdominal distention; a belly packed with yesterday's and todays culinary trespasses. A colon packed tightly with poo that will soon be chuckling at me as it rips my asshole and leaves a dookie the size of a forearm floating in my commode. 

Enough to make this a one off stumble? Hopefully.

I went about a week and a half not passing stool at all. I was using constantly, with subs in between. No space on the calendar without opiates.

Then, one day when I used, I had the following symptoms:

‚Ä¢ Bloating  
‚Ä¢ Horrible Sulphur burps, very long ones  
‚Ä¢Awful Gas  
‚Ä¢Abdominal pain  
‚Ä¢ Explosive diarrhea  
‚Ä¢ Feeling like something was backed up on my intestinal tract  

I didn't think much of it because I have usually had a BM that was a solid log AT LEAST once a week.

Another few days pass and I use again and the exact same symptoms appear. At this point I only have liquid stool, with small bits of solid. At this point I am scared. I stop using all opiates.

The day after, I had a VERY small amount of solid stool, and in the following days I took every laxative imaginable ( senno, docusate, PEG, enemas, milk of magnesia ) and only had either liquid stool or very small slivers of very soft solid stool. I have literally no appetite. I could easily go the entire day without thinking about eating once. I can feel a huge, immobile mass somewhere in my gut. Enemas do nothing and I am very scared.

My question is this: Does the fact that I have stool at all rule out the possibility of an impaction? Can it move around/squeeze around the traffic jame so to speak? I have a doctor's appointment for monday. Any help/advice (besides ""Hey make sure you eat more fiber) would be appreciated.

After midnight there was only one place we could get black on the streets. And it was actually black mixed with cocaine, what we called one on ones because of the one to one ratio of coke to heroin. They were Rufus‚Äôs favorite. I never liked them as much as Rufus did because whatever the chemical mixture did to my heart always caused me to immediately and uncontrollably retch up vomit the color of green highlighter ink. Rufus would be dancing down the sidewalk like it was the best day of his life after we each spiked a vein with the concoction. I would stumble behind him moaning and lost with strands of stinky slime hanging from my chin.

But when we did, we always bought the one on ones, which came in multicolored balloons slightly smaller than grapes, a dozen blocks from where we slept. They came from a Guatemalan guy named ‚ÄúChato,‚Äù who had been born and raised in the capital city there. The guy always had a smile on his face and spoke little English. The first time we went, Rufus explained to me that ‚ÄúChato‚Äù meant ‚Äúshorty‚Äù or ‚Äúthe short one.‚Äù It was a nickname originating from slang spoken in the jungles in Peru.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean Peruvian jungle slang?‚Äù

‚ÄúSlang is like a way of speaking that is less than proper. You know, like how we talk on the streets or whatever.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know what slang is.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, then, just figure that there is a certain brand of slang spoken in the jungles of Peru. That‚Äôs where the name ‚ÄúChato‚Äù comes from.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI get that.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen what‚Äôs the question?‚Äù

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt you say he was from Guatemala?‚Äù

‚ÄúI did, and he is.‚Äù We slowed to let a car pass in front of us. Rufus lit a cigarette.  

‚ÄúThen why does he have a nick name native to the jungles of Peru?‚Äù

‚ÄúHmmmm‚Ä¶. I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôve never thought about it. Most people don‚Äôt realize that Peru and Guatemala are different places when I mention it.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey are, though.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. They are, very far apart and very different. Where did you learn all of this?‚Äù

‚ÄúI might ask you the same thing, but what I really want to know is how you know they are different places and that a Guatemalan going by a Peruvian handle makes absolutely no sense but never asked yourself.‚Äù We approached the squat man standing under an overhang wearing a plaid shirt and gray beanie. He smiled at us. He wore a black strapped back pack.  

‚ÄúGood point, but here he is. What are we getting?‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou said 20 a piece, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. But he does 3 for 50.‚Äù

I never found out why the Guatemalan had a Peruvian nickname. I never found out how Rufus knew all those things about Guatemala and Peruvian slang. There were other things Chato could mean depending on where it was used, but he specifically said it was the way they used it in Peru. And I never found out how Rufus managed to avoid questions about it all, but I did do my first one on one with him behind a dumpster taking turns holding the flashlight for each other. As we walked back up towards our spot, he danced. I stumbled and puked. ",1535122548.0

A long while ago I had come across a website that detailed all the world's countries (or most) and what their methadone laws and regulations were, both for locals and for travellers. I thought I had bookmarked it as I knew I would eventually need this information, but I guess I must have been high and fucked up that one simple task. This website said if you could bring methadone into the country as a tourist and if there were any time restrictions (for example, like you could only bring in a 3 day supply) . It also said if methadone wasn't prescribed in that country but you were still allowed to bring in a certain amount as a tourist. I think it also noted if it was possible to get a prescription locally once you've arrived.

This info is super important to me for helping me choose which country I go to on exchange in university. I'm considering a country in Eastern Europe but for privacy reasons I'm not naming it.

I'm also wondering if anyone ever went for a semester or two abroad and what were the logistics of trying to arrange a prescription transfer to a new clinic in the new country you're studying in. Does traveller's insurance cover this? Did you get the same amount of carries you had before? Was it a pain in the ass to set it all up? Anything I should know?

\*edit: forgot to say that the website looked like it was made in the early 00's and the info was clearly organized in one big table with a few headers to organize the info.",1535109579.0

Well I ate one and instantly noticed that the taste was really weak and was def not oxy.

I remember trying to eat a popsicle trying to fight the intense nod taking over me, next thing I know I‚Äôm in a haze of paramedics yelling as if they were far away. Kinda remeber puking in the ambulance the second time they narcanned me. They say i was brought back twice, once when they got to me and then I fell out again in the ambulance which was when they sprayed me again and I puked. The whole thing is still a blur but the nurse said they had to use 4 doses of Narcan in total to keep me stable until the Ivs were set up. I‚Äôve already told my boys what happened and the plug said he‚Äôs gonna warm people from now on but I fucking doubt that. I got out of the hospital and detox last week and these fuckers are getting around in my town. People are dieing and I gaurentee it‚Äôs these K9s

Been on opi for about 8 yrs, which is disgusting/sad to hear for me as I can't recall many eventful things throughout the time. But anyways, I had moved from NJ to the Cali area and had to switch from raw/ecp to the black (BTH) for the first time. Got the hang of IV tar (feels so much worse on the veins compared to powder) but I also learned to appreciate IMing. It seems anytime IM is brought up though, the pitchforks start coming out. So while others may have different thoughts/experiences, for me personally, I have not run into any problems from IM use, even with BTH.

I am not advocating the use, but just want to describe my personal experience with the ROA. I think the problem lies with people confusing Intramuscular (IM) with Subcutaneous, with most thinking of the latter, especially when they talk about a ""miss"" while trying to IV. I think the key to successful IM use is making sure you actually hit the muscle. Longer rigs are obviously easier, I have had to resort to using insulin rigs preferably atleast 1in (have been able to use 1/2in due to sucky pharmacists, but need to push harder into the skin)

I will also admit I learned the hard way as well from not knowing the difference. When I would not successfully reach the muscle during the early stages, I would say an abscess formed about 1/4 to 1/3 of the time. Majority of the time when I failed using IM, a bump would form and be sore for a few days but then eventually dissipate, especially when adding alot of heat as treatment. However the times when an abscess did form, I gotta say it was pretty damn disgusting.

I haven't posted about this as it worried me that I had never seen anyone post or link pics to an abscess that looked similar to mine throughout the many years I've lurked here. I was mainly using the outer upper arm and outer upper hip area before I finally figured it out. But when I did miss subcutaneously, sometimes it would go through the typical abscess formation, with it coming to a point (like a pimple) early on and eventually rupture, with all the pus and nastiness coming out. I would say the typical size of the burst hole is about a quarter, with the overall inflamed area around a golf ball size. I just keep the area dry/bandaged and it eventually healed itself but it was a major pain nonetheless. (Note: for me, they took very long to completely heal. Imagine having an open hole around your waste/hips, or multiple, that slowly leak constantly and takes over 3-4 months to heal)

But other times, the abscess will not come to a head and burst and instead just continue getting sore and heated for a few days. Sometimes it was multiple abscesses that would connect or ""tunnel"" with each other. I had read that you shouldn't force it to burst so I wait until it gets to a stage where I can feel the pressure building and from an old abscess booklet I read, wait for the texture of my skin to feel like a blister and then make my own incision. The dark pus/liquid/debris starts pouring out immediately. And when I apply some more pressure on the harder parts of the bulge, a ton of thick jell-o like black stuff comes shooting out onto the air. Ill hit an end point where nothing else comes out, but it will require a few more daily sessions as more builds up (maybe loosens?), which lessens significantly each time.

The jello like substance appears to be more like coagulated blood and pus, however towards the end of drainage, as it takes a couple days, these dark clumps of what I am guessing is the insoluables from the cut and dead tissue and other nastiness combines. I figure its the former tissue/muscle that used to make up the newly drained hole. Prayed it wasn't the necrosis but after getting as much squeezed out as I can, it slowly starts to heal (from the inside up like any abscess) It's really twisted but I get this weird sort of relief, like a massive blackhead being removed, with larger clumps feeling ""better""? I'm sickened even writing this but I know I keep the incision hole as small as possible as it can still come flying out from pressure. 

I swear the amount of stuff that comes out is mind-boggling. I gently apply pressure from all angles and depending on the size/severity of the abscess, the draining will eventually stop when the pus is all out. I imagine all the solid debris that looks like dark flecks are the insoluble parts of the cut that my body couldnt eliminate? When I had an abscess like this, the size of the open hole was similar to quarter size, but when you softly palmed the area, you could definitely feel a ""hollow"" space under the skin layer where the abscess filled. I am guessing that is the lost tissue/muscle? I only took pictures the first time this happened (upper arms) but I was an idiot (like most addicts) and let this happen around my hip area as well. 

Now I imagine by this point many readers think I should die just from stupidity and being retarded from not going to get medical treatment. I will admit to being embarrassed/shamed of public knowledge of my use as I'm a middle class corporate worker and at the time, I was really worried about the cost for treatment and somehow scheduling it without my family finding out, and most importantly, it wasn't really that painful and didn't notice any other symptoms. Repeat, the pain was not unbearable nor did I observe any other negative or ill like symptoms as I monitored myself and would have gone to get help if I even felt remotely worse. I just think common sense goes a long way too, not that I am some special case. Also learned that stressing  out just makes it worse and to remember to think rationally. I seriousle drove myself crazy researching other posts and all the warnings about sepsis, staph, necrofacblabla, amputations, and believe me, those thoughts were definitely in my mind.

Again, I am just stating my experience and learning lessons. I continue to use IV and IM (properly) and have not encountered any abscesses for a while (hope forever). I am definitely an advocate of harm reduction. The aftermath of all this wreckless harm to my body is the skin on my upper arms each have about 3-4 small bump scars from where the abscess holes finally healed. The skin is definitely darker and a but pigmented near the bumps. I was fortunate that they are high enough to not show when wearing a t-shirt. I am not planning to wear any tanks/beaters in public as well. Also, I have similar pigmented/darker patches of skin where the abscesses healed near my hips. Fortunate again as they are right below my waistline and not visible per how I usually dress.

If anyone really wants to see an example, I should be able to retrieve the few pictures I had from my old phone, just let me know and I will try to get it onto imgur asap. It just really grosses me out and I recall erasing some of them.

TL;DR - Have been able to use IM as ROA, even with BTH. But Subcutaneous use lead to abscesses and I found out the hard way.

                            27 Male/33 Female
                             3 year relationship


                                  Background

  Our relationship started January of 2016, approaching 3 years ago. I have been mostly single my entire adult life. I'd been on many dates, this woman absolutely captivated me from day one. After a year of being together, we got our first apartment together. For the first time in my life, I felt fulfilled. Eventually, it felt so right, I proposed. Everything seemed to be falling right into place....

                                     Doin' Time

  In the beginning of our relationship, she was on probation, and had to serve 8 months in a Work release program. If you're unaware of what Work release is, it is essentially a lighter version of jail. You get passes to go places, you're able to go to work, that kinda thing.
  I didn't leave her at that time because I saw past her mistakes. I was so captivated by this woman, I wanted to make a difference in her life, and I succeeded. When she got out, there was a huge difference in her maturity. In those 8 months, that is where we developed true love and best friends. I had also helped her with her son, whom I also developed a relationship. When she got out, we got our first apartment together.

           I don't like the drugs, the drugs like me

  This is the hardest part to discuss, because everyone has their own strong opinion of the matter. Please, try to have an open mind if you can't relate to substance abuse.
  She and I both, have had substance abuse issues prior to meeting each other. It wasn't really a problem in the beginning. It was seemingly casual, up until the past 6 months. 
  One day we went to the store, I ran into a friend of mine I hadn't seen in years. Long story short, he asked me to come by since he lived down the street from us. From that decision on, we quickly fell down a slippery slope. Full blown addiction grasped us. 

                     The beginning of the end

  In the past 6 months, it has been by far the hardest I've lived, she as well for that matter. She caught a possession charge, I got my first DUI. Between finances and the legal system, our relationship has been strained.
  The night she caught her possession charge, obviously she went to jail for 60 days. At the time, I had no idea how long she was going to be there. Had I got my sh*t together in that time, we probably wouldn't be where we are today. With that said, I completely lost my mind. My addiction was the only way I knew to cope with my now broken family. In that time, I gave up my apartment, caught a DUI (my first offense ever). The world seemed to be crumbling right before me.

                            Where we are today

 60 days pass, she finally comes home. By home, I mean a friend who has allowed us to live with her, god bless. I got clean the day she gets out. I had enough of the crap, and it was time to fix this once and for all. 
 Sobriety happened for us for a month, before drugs found us again. A month passes of using, and she quits. House arrest, there is no messing around. She has successfully been sober since, she's been sober for a month. 
   This is the sad part. I have mostly been clean in the month she's been sober, I have slipped. I came home one day, 2 weeks ago, and she could see it in my eyes. One too many times, she had enough. From that day, I haven't touched anything. I went home to my parent's, believing that was it. 2 days pass, she misses me and asked me to come back. We have sex, I love you's are back. 
    As of today, I'm receiving mixed signals. We are back to sobriety and getting along well, but the romance is shifty. One moment she seems to be about working on this, the next she seems unsure. I honestly, don't know where I stand at this point. I don't believe in letting go when times get tough. You get through it and grow. Anyway, that is our story this far....



                                        tl;dr
My girlfriend of three years made the decision to dump me. Considering her reasons, I've truly made the effort to fix the problem. One day she seems to be about the possibility of making it work, the next she's reminding me why it won't. She is still defensive over me as if we are still together, she got overly jealous when her friend wore one of my sweatshirts. Maybe that doesn't matter, but it seems to be a clue something could still be there. Back to the point, I'm unsure how to approach this. Do I stay here at her friend's, and see what happens? Do I decide to go back to my parent's, possibly leaving her for good? I don't have any answers. I have complete determination to make this work after a hard lesson learned. It..means..everything.

I have some limited experience with both as I successfully used DCK for tolerance which helped. I snorted the dose and didn't use any more opiates that day, and it helped me to lower tolerance from 75-100mg a shot to 50mg which was the dose I started with (ie the dose I was taking when I first started using morphine). That was about 2 months after I started taking opiates daily.

I've also used ketamine for managing tolerance (I injected around 35mg) which didn't really help (I used morphine around 3 hours after K).

I took the same dose of ketamine few days later and it helped me with withdrawals (I've been using morphine (at doses around 300mgs daily) and other opiates for 4 months at the time). I haven't experienced any physical symptoms but mentally I didn't make it and started using morphine again after 3 days.

What are your experiences? Do you have any research papers on that matter? How should I administer ketamine to lower tolerance?",1535068011.0

There is no room for feelings or weakness. Many have been consumed by its vast pitfalls. Many still dance on the edges of certain doom. But there is a power that comes from knowing how to navigate in the danger, and it becomes intoxicating. Regular life, the life of a ‚Äúcitizen‚Äù as I have come to describe it, loses its flavor. One begins to crave the taste of risk, the rush of broken laws and the way surviving the street each day feels like destiny manifested. 
But after so long, inevitably the rush and the euphoria fades, just like the chemicals one may have been seeking when he first began to foray into the street. Things we are so quick to take for granted in our old lives disappear, like regular hygiene and steady employment. The chaos wears us thin, and we begin to shut off more and more to the outside world, receding deep within where physical and emotional pain can no longer hurt us. We worship at the feet of a god who knows not our name or our path. We drill down onto whatever false savior we have aligned ourselves to with the focus of a surgeon. Our salvation is always within our reach, in the bottle or the pipe or the needle. It never judges. It never questions. It never notices.
When the day of reckoning arrives, if one is fortunate enough to reach that day, it is a stark and terrifying truth we are forced to confront. The drugs stop working. The bonds and the routines betray us, and we are once again empty, stumbling deeper into the vast emptiness of our own tattered souls. Two paths are presented. One is the path we have been running from for so long, we know immediately where it leads. It is the path of living a purpose driven life, filled with obligation, accomplishment, love, disappointment, plans for the future, failure, despair, joy, and so much more. The path to a life lived is one we have the greatest fear of taking. 
The other path, dark and treacherous, beckons to us, but we can feel the danger and the deceit that hides along its jagged rocky outcroppings. This is the path to death. A sad and lonely death is the only destination. Usually those who choose this second path are the catalyst that rockets them toward that shallow grave. It‚Äôs is the only escape for the lost and broken soul who can no longer find refuge in the false gods he once served. 
The human mind and body are not indestructible; there is a limit to the amount of suffering and utter despair one can endure. Offer prayers of love and forgiveness for those of us who have given in to the path of oblivion, for no earthly creature can truly say they have found true peace. No one can save a man who has journeyed down the path of oblivion, and too often it is true that turning back becomes impossible. Mercy and peace to them all. Mercy and peace to the livers of life as well. Both paths require courage and fortitude. Both are harrowing and often offer no quarter.",1535064418.0

This has been the first binge when i dipped into #4 H as supply suddenly dried up and didn't want to deal with a sudden stop as i hide my use from friends/family.

Seems H can get out of hand real quick and tolerance obviously builds fast so i got up to about a bundle a day. I definitely don't feel like i NEED a bundle to avoid sickness and assume half of that would be sufficient enough to avoid sickness while dropping my tolerance but unsure as its my first time doing this.

Can anyone recommend a practical plan for someone whos been doign a bundle a day for about 2 months? should i cut it in half for a week and then drop 25% per week from there on out? would love some tips from veterans, thank you.

TLDR: What % of a drop from daily use would you recommend for someone trying to ween off of a bundle per day habit? Been snorting this amount for about 2 months. I assume its not very strong stuff either in case that matters, don't have much to compare it to...

I will say that speed was a much more toxic addiction for me than opiates, that stuff drove me crazy and very easy to lose control of your mind(amp psychosis) and make your appearance look terrible. This lasted 2 years and i had developed a huge auxiety disorder and felt terrible( panic attacks when i was out couldnt sleep),this led to me standing with my Mom talking next thing i know im on the ground(Huge headrush and lost control of my body). i checked into detox for 5 days  after that, they gave me 2 10mg valium during my stay. Havent touched speed or alcohol since.

&#x200B;

Downers,psychedelics, and valhalla  

When i got out i went to my doctor and explained my situation and was prescribed .5mg clonazepam 4x daily for my auxiety. It worked and the cravings for speed and alcohol left completly. Benzos Benzos Benzos goddawn i thought quitting speed was hard, anyone whos been on heavy does of benzos for months on end knows what i mean when you quit cold turkey. My girlfriend recommended shrooms and that changed my whole life(i looked at myself in a new perspective and didnt like what i seen) stopped benzos completly(still use Xanax every now and then) and went on a journey through my mind-acid mescaline   and god of them all DMT(what a trip). No more auxiety since none its almost like the DMT changed something in my brain and i was at peace with myself and still am( this is not a sad story im doing great which is why im writing this).

At this stage im 20 have a great job, great girlfriend, my own place life is good and still is. I was out moutain biking and hit a turn and ran straight into a thick branch of a tree. Broke my collarbone ( doctor gave me nothing but anti infammitory) but my friend gave me some perks 5/325. Holy Fuck is all i have to say about the first time i got high on opiods it felt like heaven on earth and in my mind was the perfect high. Started getting 25 every month and would take around 20mg a day till i ran out. Best sex of my life was on Oxycodone i dont know if its just me but does it ever put me on that level. This went on for 6 months or so but after awhile i found out that the tylenol was bad for my liver so on to oxycontin. But it was discontined and i hate Neos they make me itch soo bad. As some of you know there still going strong in other parts of world.

&#x200B;

At this stage im 21 still have my job, a different girlfriend, and still renting my own place and getting 14 O.C 80s every month. Im using 40mg a day(still do) and living my life happily. I take a 2 week break every 2 months.

Here i am at 24 still doing the same thing and still on my same dose every night when i get off work. I have my own house now and a new car thats paid off no girlfriend atm though. Oxycodone seems to not affect me like the speed or benzos, im addicted no question but im a functioning addict and healthy person for the most part. The reason im writing this is because everywhere i read that if your on opiates your gonna end up shooting up and ruining your life etc etc. In my opinion through my 4 years of use opiods are not hard on your body and you can live your life perfectly fine while on them. I find with opiods you just have to take breaks so your dopamine has time to recover. Iv only ever used them orally and at my height was using an 80 a day.   Have any of you had the same experience? Have any of you been able to go 10 years while being a functioning addict compared to my 4? I feel like opiates get a bad rap but when your not to greedy and live a healthy lifestyle you can function just fine in my opinion. Im sorry for the long post thank you for any input:)

Will post some pics once i fugure out how to do it discreetly.

I was all over the place when I wrote that post. I didn‚Äôt know how to cope. My mum got diagnosed with cancer, I found out that my wife beating alcohol father who who presumed missing only died a died a few weeks ago and my sister died two weeks ago. They‚Äôve changed the immigration laws in oz, despite the fact that my son, partner and ex partner are all Australian it‚Äôs almost impossible to get a job despite being highly qualified. I‚Äôm very well known in another field and got fucked over brutally in ways I cannot describe because someone women choose to us their vagina and a demonstration of their talent. 

I get the impression that some people get preferential treatment on here. Stories of people losing custody of their children, losing their children altogether, getting away with major felonies as well as stories of extreme violence towards other individuals and leavings others to do OD. 

I‚Äôm not looking for sympathy, i don‚Äôt want it in any shape or form.

I wrote the post in a rush as I needed to vent to a community that i thought would understand the plight of an addict. Let me clarify a few things. I hadn‚Äôt taken taken anything except the cannabis which I was did not intentionally take. Not an excuse. I see so many posts about people driving high or after having taken a shot and most don‚Äôt get the same reactions. My last dose of Xanax was 36 hours before the incident. My lose dose of H was 8 hours before the incident. I did not take any in my kids presence and never did and have never have. I was starting to go through mild WDs. I‚Äôve been using for two months after my ten year relapse. Not an an excuse but I had no idea the vape pen had cannabis in it. 

A lot of things were phrased incorrectly, i was just telling you guys what I had left and wondering what to do what that gram. I‚Äôve sold it to a some guy who used to middle for me and using the money for therapy. 

The child was born without my consent. The court granted me full custody but a child needs his father and and I never had one growing up. He sought therapy, worked on himself and became a better person. 

The police got me to drive physically get into the car and drive it into a safer spot. My encounters with the NSW police has not been great in the past- they didn‚Äôt give a shit when all my my stuff got robbed or when I got mugged but they were amazing. They‚Äôre experienced enough to not to let someone who is fucked up beyond belief not to do that. 

The hospital and police report says I suffered from a seizure. They both noted my my first priority was my child and that he was an extremely happy young boy with a strong bond towards me. 

When I said the gram is gone and I‚Äôm done, I meant either sell it or flush it. I chose the former and used the money for CBT.

I‚Äôm not a nasty or malicious person. I give and I give until nothing is gone. I have my child my life even thought he was the product of rape the best that I could. When I‚Äôm at my lowest I always help others. I have never ever reached out to anyone for help. Any time I reached out for help to my mother, it was a torrent of abuse, malice and insults for something as simple as wanting a little bit of a help with my maths tests or picking an outfit. My life was strictly controlled to every extent despite having started school two years early and excelling beyond belief. Last night‚Äôs post has taught me that reaching out for help or venting no matter what will bring me back to square one. 

Medical professionals often treat us like scum because they‚Äôve never been there. A huge part of me wants to call it quits because this isn‚Äôt something i can do alone. You guys are right, I am a piece of shit and my loved ones are better off without me. I can‚Äôt do this alone. You guys are right, I‚Äôm just a junkie piece of shit who doesn‚Äôt deserve anyone around me.

I sincerely hope that those trying or struggling to stay clean get there. Shoot me a message while I‚Äôm still around if you need to vent. ",1535011064.0

The grateful dead have become the band people patronize through jokes about drug filled fans who only love songs so long cause the drugs.

The grateful dead created alternative rock music and the idea of concerts. They played bluegrass before becoming the dead. They took weekend festivals bluegrass bands began in rhe early 60s and decided rock music should have the same. So they pulled together Monterey pop, Altamont, the free love in, sunshine day dream, and. Even the Woodstock promoters got help from the band/band,manager.

Their philosophy has always been making a living through ticket sales. Real musicians play live and sound better,than any studio recordings. It's impossible to recreate the synergy, chemistry a band gets playing live.  They have acoustic ballads, country songs, blues songs, jazz songs, covers, funk, first adopters of electronic music ( now edm.), they have songs 4 minutes long to 48 minute long meditative journeys, pop songs, old rock n roll songs, blue grass songs, and psychadelic space time ripping orchestras your brain can only hold on to as it makes you dive deep in the brain.  

They have over 2400 songs in their catalog.  They never play a song the same way twice. A song played Friday night might have a guitar solo in a completely different scale mode/category/type Tuesday night's version has. Played by the piano between a different verse too.

They improv together and the songs are long because they either jam one song into another, or write songs meant to morph into the next without stopping. I often find myself holding my breath, or feel my heart beating through my chest when they play. They build up whole concerts with separate waves of energy over 6 to 8 hours. Slowly building to songs rocking like the freebird solo speed, or so delicate, one tickle of the piano ivory keeps the beat of an old gospel tune.


The dead had 4 main singers. Jerry is only one of the two main. Bobby is the other and I prefer his songs better. They were forced to after their main singer died in 72. In the 80 to 90s, young Brent brought his songs and voice.


Listen to them. I guarantee they're not at all what you expect. Lmk and ill give you a show to listen to. Live is how thru want to listen. They've always encouraged the audience to record and give the shows away for free. From 65 to 95. Every show is available for free and the soundboard recording to. Pristine.

Even the acid tests. Where you bought a ticket and you got a cup out of multiple huge trash cans filled with koolaid and lsd.


Unfortunately, jerry died when he checked into rehab. His heart gave out starting his detox. He started smoking heroin in the late 70 s and continued off and on til his death. Brent died of a speed ball too. The rest of the members ALWAYS tried getting,them to stick to anything but dope. I'm with them.


Get at me. I bought my first live show at Xmas at 14. I still listen to the dead and the stories their songs tell are priceless. Songs for any situation in life. 

Tldr: listen to the dead. People always connect the dead to heroin. I wanted to clarify it was only a big part of jerry's life and he didnt shoot it. He also died trying to get clean.",1534988671.0

How many baggies to get charged with selling?,"I live in WA state for the record. Like do they test an already cleaned off baggy for for microscopic residue just to charge you or can you have a tiny bit on you and not get charged etc.? I'm asking cause my purse has a secret pocket (I guess not so secret now) I made that I keep things like my hit kit and tooters (for smoking,) any other random paranaphelia and small amounts of drugs (which I also keep in a separate hiding place in my purse.) The drugs are usually meth and sometimes heroin. I know that people aren't idiots though and could probably notice things like there being things in my purse if they were looking through it that they can't seem to find if they touched it which would lead them to the ""secret"" pocket so I'm just wondering if I shouldn't keep like old bags and slightly dirty tooters that may have residue on them in case I get searched (why do people get searched anyway, like for what reason could a cop search me and my stuff?) Is there a certain number of baggies you can have on you cause I heard if you had a certain amount (I""m not sure how much though) you'd get charged with selling but those things accumulate fast when you buy small bags and my mom spends most of her time at home so it's hard to clean out my purse at least really frequently (our walls are thin.) And how much time do you think I would be looking at if I did get caught with them? I know it sounds pretty fucking dumb to carry those things around in your purse but I live with my parents and they don't know as far as I know and so I can't do them in the house when they're not there and it looks normal to leave with my purse or a backpack as apposed to my hit kit out in the open etc. I can also bring my purse into the bathroom and still look normal so they don't go through it and throw out my stuff when I'm taking a shower and stuff so it has it's advantages too. My parents do know that I have a past at least with drugs though just fyi so I bet they do go through my stuff when I'm not there  bc they did even before I started doing hard drugs.

I've never had any run-ins with the law besides speeding tickets and I don't want that to change.

I'm looking for advice but I'm not really sure if this is the right subreddit to post asking this. I'll go into more detail if needed but here's a TLDR at the beginning to save you a read: to sum things up, I have severe pain in both my hands as well as wide spread aches and stiffness in my entire body, though not as severe as my hands. My bones feel like dust. I feel like I've been poisoned down to my bones. I've had a plethora of tests done and they havnt shown anything so far. My doctor refuses to give me any opiates stronger than Tramadol. What can I do to get stronger painkillers or even better any idea what might be wrong with me and how I can cure it so I don't need painkillers?

My doctor incorrectly believes tramadol is not addictive though it definitely is. I took it years ago for back pain and had horrible withdrawals when I came off it. He gave me a weeks worth of oxycontin when I first presented with the severe hand pain and it's only gotten worse since then. He gave me oxycontin 10mg twice daily as I was in tears the pain was so severe. It helped a little but now he's refusing to give me anything other than Tramadol and/or anti-inflammatorys despite the fact I told him they are barely touching the pain and have awful side effects. (Brain zaps and affecting my mood). Im talking 100mg tramadol 3 times a day so quite a large dose bit it's barely helping at all. He won't even give me codeine for some bizarre reason even though it's weaker than Tramadol. I've taken that before and never had the same negative side effects that tramadol causes. I've tried talking to him and rayionalising the situation and begging and talking some more and he won't even let me talk/ask about a morphine based stronger opiate anymore. All of this is really starting to stress me out and I feel incredibly sad hopeless and depressed. He keeps going on about my age and how I shouldn't be taking these at my age (I'm 26 but feel 80 right now). I don't see how it matters what age I am as the medicine I'm asking for is addictive to anyone who uses it whether young or old. The pain is so bad now I feel like I'm unable to work. Though obviously I have to work to keep an income. He keeps blaming the medicine board and regulations but it seems like a lie to me or an excuse not to help me. There has been new regulations regarding strong medications like oxycontin being prescribed for short term use only in my country. So I get his point that when the tests aren't pointing to any particular problem he can't really prescribe me strong medication regularly or atleast it's difficult to do so and would attract unwanted attention. But this seems ridiculous to me at the same time because I can barely dress myself in the morning which is not normal for someone my age and it's clear I need something stronger when I'm so much suffering. It feels like hes just covering his own ass and not eilling to help me. He's not even trying to treat the problem in other ways though. I've had to ask him to do tests and explain how medicines work to him. I explained that the side effects tramadol were causing me were likely due to its SSRI activity. He said its not an SSRI. I had to explain to him for 10mins over the phone it was and eventually told him to read the wikipedia page. To his shock it said it was a weak SSRI and he then thought i studied pharmacology. Whereas its basic googling my medication before I take it knowledge. His medical knowledge seems incredibly out-dated. After learning a little bit more about the medication he prescribes probably ten times a day to different patients he still refused to give me something else. Why even give me the week of oxycontin to begin with if it so worrying to him?

I only got an x-ray done on my hands literally today, I had also to ask for it to be done, surely it should be standard practise to give someone an x-ray on day 1 and not after three months of suffering? So ya, this has been ongoing constant severe pain for three months and I feel like I'm going crazy. I honestly can't take it anymore. Before you say it also doesn't seem to be mental illness related, as no matter how stressed or down or happy I feel on any given day. The pain is still there. I can be very stressed or upset and it does not get worse. It has however steadily been getting worse over time. When my hands first got sore it was just mild stiffness and I felt no need to go to the doctor or even take an ibuprofen, but now I can barely use my phone. It is a huge effort to type all this out so thank you for baring with me.

I dont have the technical names for the tests to hand right now but I can get these if needed. Tests done so far include: white blood cells, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, inflammation, vitamin levels, mineral levels and all other standard blood tests. According to all these tests I am perfectly healthy and show no signs of inflammation. However my hands and feet do swell up every now and again so I don't understand how I have no inflammation whatsoever. I'm in constant pain all the time, aches and bad stiffness all over my body. I sleep ok and eat relatively healthy. I also have a bad, sharp, pain in my neck. Widespread muscle tension, fatigue and occasional nausea. It feels like I've had the flu and two broken hands for months now. Pain does not travel down my entire arms so it doesn't appear to be a pinched nerve in my neck causing the hand pain. It is just isolated severe pain from my wrists to my fingers. 

I was also referred to a private rheumatologist. This was also no help whatsoever. He charged me a small fortune for a short ten minute meeting and told me I have tennis elbow and fibromyalgia, he conducted just one test: patting and squeezing my arms. He squeezed a pressure point on my elbow very hard and I said ""ow!"". He later didn't seem to listen to me when I said my elbows were fine that it was my hands that hurt. He then proceeded to give me a steroid injection into each elbow and prescribed me low dose naltrexone. This didnt help at all. Naltrexone is not a licenced treatment for either fibromyalgia or tennis elbow either. Neither of these diagnosis really match up with my symptoms either but maybe im biased because I dont like that theres no test for fibromyalgia. But that's besides the point. That was the only treatment I've received beside painkillers and anti infammatorys and nothings working. There is no test for fibromyalgia so it sounds like a bit of a throwaway diagnosis to me. I feel like the doctors just can't figure out what's wrong with me so they do and say whatever they can to get rid of me or pass me onto someone else and just don't try and help me. I'm spending so much money on all of this. I'm giving my resignation into work tomorrow because I can't cope with it any longer. It's too painful and I'm missing too much days as it is. It doesn't seem right to stay on the payroll when I'm missing so much days.

I am waiting for blood tests results for haemochromatosis, vitamin D deficiency, and thyroid function. I had to ask my doctor to do these tests, he doesn't seem to have any ideas of his own, he doesn't make suggestions to try and figure out what's wrong with me. These could be likely culprits as I'm from Ireland and they are quite common in Irish people apparently. But I'm worried nothing will show up again and I'll be left to suffer with no help treatment or cure in sight.

Does anyone know how I can convince my doctor to give me stronger painkillers? Should I stop seeing him and go to another doctor? Does anyone know what might be wrong with me? Most important question but a long shot - does anyone know what could cure me so I don't need to take painkillers?",1534973346.0

A quote once said: ‚Äúdon‚Äôt go looking for happiness in all the places that made you lose it‚Äù.

I‚Äôve been taking the steps to not do that in life. But the only temporary feeling of normal emotions (including sadness and not limited to happiness) was when I was on some kind of opioid/opiate. 

Yesterday I felt some normality again and felt sad right after knowing once the Vicodin and Valium wear off, I‚Äôm back to this robotic state: *numb and empty* ‚Äîyet full of so many thoughts.

And I‚Äôve been on Suboxone for over 3 months now after I stopped because I‚Äôm heading to the military to learn discipline without having my parents alive and all. My support systems feel so distant to me. 

And all these feelings; I know I‚Äôm not the only one to experience them: so this means that someone found a way out of feeling like this. Yet I can‚Äôt seem to.

I just dosed a drug that I almost hate and I am prescribed, *Adderall*20mg, and it only lasts about two hours; then a blanket of total sadness came over me again: I can‚Äôt talk, I feel this impending sadness, tears stuck that I confused that feeling of wanting to cry for wanting to puke ‚Äîall while sitting on the couch with my family I haven‚Äôt saw in a while.

I took my Valium with it too to mellow out. But then now, about 4 hours later I take another dose because I couldn‚Äôt shake that feeling of wanting to cry for minutes on minutes. 

And it really seems Suboxone only works for me for about 3 days or so before pooping out.. I feel no different on or off it. So I‚Äôm 5 days about without it now.

And then I have my girlfriend bitching at me on the phone while she‚Äôs at work saying how my actions effect others, I didn‚Äôt go up to get my Suboxone filled, I keep missing appointments ‚Äîand I‚Äôm 100% aware of the consequences of my actions but it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm stuck. I can‚Äôt even lift a limb. 
It‚Äôs like a ‚Äúpsychomotor retardation‚Äù feeling is the best way I can describe it.

No amount of time at therapy as helped me through this. Not any medications except temporarily using them: their effects diminish after a few days. A daily regimen feels imperative.

Guys I really don‚Äôt know where to turn now. I feel no escape from this nor coping mechanism except a pill. All my old methods doesn‚Äôt help me much. Even slow progress.",1534972769.0

I can‚Äôt imagine that noise not driving someone insane although j imagine You either learn to embrace the ding or hopefully u can‚Äôt hear it inside the apartment. The dinging is quickly pushed out of my head as My body reminds me that I‚Äôm sick...I hadn‚Äôt forgotten and I can‚Äôt wait another second. I know this is a major nono and my dboy would chew me a new asshole and probably block my number if he found out I was getting ready to use in the stairwell but all that could be dealt with once I had gotten well.


I worked quickly and soon enough I had it all laid out ready to go. I ready my straw bring my phone screen up and as I hear another annoying. DING! I inhale, no better feelings exists  then when you go from Sick to well.  I honestly can‚Äôt think of a single thing that is better. I hurriedly get the deed done and begin my descent down the piss smelling and cigarette butt laden staircase. I hit the first floor and walk back into the sun. Only this time it‚Äôs not oppressive and unbearable like it had been just 5 minutes earlier! 
 
Now  I embraced the warmth and the rays of light danced and flickered through the leaves of the trees. I could feel my legs starting to regain strength, the cramps in my calves finally subsiding thank god! I cross the street to the corner deli looking for the homeless kid I‚Äôve seen the last few days, I had planned on buying him a cig and some lunch but he was no where to be found. I gave up went in the deli got myself a dew code red and 5 looseys and went on my way lighting up a cig as started to walk towards to subway. 

This was the most rundown ghetto part of town I had ever been in while doing dope. I would never bring my gf (my ex gfi mean) down here. One cause I don‚Äôt want her to see that besides the color of my skin I fit in pretty well down here. I made that mistake once before showing of my knowledge of the shit part of queens. It didn‚Äôt go over well and was met with a lot of suspicion. The other reason was I didn‚Äôt want things to go wrong while  I was here and her ending up hurt or robbed. 

As I walked a homeless woman approached me asking to by her a metro card when I told her I had planned in hopping the turnstile she then asked for a dollar when I reiterated that I was JUMPING THE TURNSTILE, she then focus on what was left of my cigarette. Out of pure aggravation I gave her what was left maybe 1/4 of a Newport. I pulled a very English move an tutted as I walked away upset that I once again felt compelled to give away my hard earned cigarette. These people don‚Äôt realize that 9/10 they have more money than I do. That soon enough I would be on the streets with them. Why? Because drugs. Drugs always seem to take precedence. I‚Äôll look for a job once I get well I tell myself daily. Then I get well and no job is searched for...

Anyways. I walk back to the subway realizing I had a few more dollars than I normally do I went to McDonald‚Äôs to eat. Again my first meal in about 18 hours. I do another bag in the bathroom when I arrive but for once I intend on sticking around and buying something. 

After I eat and smoke a second cig I descend into the subway to hop a train and begin the long grueling subway ride back to where I live. And that‚Äôs where I am right now. Sitting on an uptown 4 express train waiting patiently to get back home. Where reality surely awaits me.

I'm coming to you as a sister of someone who IVs Heroin and Meth. A short background: He's been in the life for about 8 years. Been to rehab 2 times and had a year sobriety about 5 years ago. He then began a relationship with a woman and it is toxic. They began to use together and have been for quite sometime now. Things recently came to a head. They're broke, fight all the time, his health is shit, and her kids have been taken away (which he was really invested in). We have known he was using again as it became very obvious, but recently learned that he was now doing meth too. So the question is:

As a user, what would it take for you to go to treatment? NOT what is your bottom, but how can we approach treatment with him that will give us a better chance to support him and get him there.

How would you want someone to offer a non-judgemental hand? 

In the past we have used tough love, we have no leverage. He talks about going but feels guilty for leaving his girlfriend at her lowest, (may just be an excuse). Is it a good idea to help her find treatment too? She is not close with us and really distances herself because of the drugs. 

Our current approach is letting him open up to us which seems to be working but very slow. His life is running out, we cant wait anymore. He legit could be dead right now and we wouldn't even know.

So I had accumulated some clean time and felt the need to reward myself obviously (junkie logic) leading me to drive into the nearby city with a decent hood to score in. The shit is pretty much all dope/fent or pure fent down here in Florida. Head to my usual spot, start walking around and getting asked what I needed but I'm a pretty discerning customer when cold copping (been burned by weak/bunk product too many times to count) so I mostly refused and kept searching for someone familiar. Finally saw a group of guys I'd cold copped from a bunch of times and their shit was always straight so I bought a bunch and headed back to my car. I no longer had an apartment in the city so I drove to a nearby spot I used to use to fix when I would be in withdrawal because while I totally disagree with driving high, I think we can all agree driving after you've gotten right is MUCH safer than driving in withdrawal. 

  
Parked my car and turned on some jams. I was expecting to fix and then go for a walk and get some food or just enjoy the city since I didn't want to be driving if I was actually high (it's not like I was in withdrawal and getting right). Did my usual ritual, prepped the shot, found a vein which was super easy since I'd be clean everything had healed pretty nicely and shot up a baggie. Normally, a bag is enough to get me well and in my excitement from copping for the first time in a while and preparing to get fucked up, I forgot to account for the fact I had absolutely no tolerance and a single bag from these guys would have me nodding hard/knocked out when I was shooting $100/day. 

  
The last thing I remember thinking is ""Wow this is really good shit I'm super fucked up"" and then there's literally nothing. It's just like there's a hole in my memory until I feel something on my face and I try to pull it off and someone goes to stop me. That's when I realize I'm lying in the back of an ambulance on oxygen and telemetry. Apparently an off duty cop wandered by and saw me knocked out in the front seat of my car in this parking lot and was unable to rouse me. 

&#x200B;

At this point the ambulance hasn't gone anywhere, we're still in the parking lot while they continue to monitor my vitals and ask me what I took. I kept insisting I hadn't taken anything but my prescribed anti-anxiety drugs and that I was just really sleep deprived. They obviously didn't believe me since they explained it took two narcan shots to bring me around. At that point I was pretty mentally with it but freaking the fuck out about my car which contained paraphernalia and a bunch of dope. I've never gone to jail in my life and I work in an industry where a drug arrest could end my career (healthcare) so now my overdose had turned into a full on panic attack thinking I was legally fucked and my heart rate and breathing were going through the roof. I began insisting I wanted to leave without further treatment and was declining transport/further services. I had to repeat I wanted to leave against medical advice probably 6-7 times because they kept insisting my vitals were too fucked for me to not go to the hospital. I pointed out I was alert and oriented, non-altered with a normal mental status. I knew my rights and I wanted out of the ambulance now. 

&#x200B;

Finally they acquiesced and removed my IV, O2, monitoring leads, etc and had me sign a refusal. They unceremoniously  kicked me out of the back of their rig and then I saw my car. The rear window had been smashed but otherwise it looked fine and my syringe was still on the floor (in plain sight, but undisturbed). There's one problem though, I can't find my keys to get into the car anywhere and it's locked. I asked the paramedics and they said they hadn't seen my keys, it wasn't until one of the local gawkers standing by informed me the paramedics had given my keys to the police officer who's cruiser was on scene. Oh shit, okay I'm completely fucked. Even though I wasn't driving, I had the keys in the ignition to power the stereo and I was in the front seat. They're gonna search my car, find all my shit and slap me with multiple charges. Possession, paraphernalia, DUI, etc.   


I jump into the window and try to grab all the paraphernalia and dope I can and shove it down my underwear as discreetly as possible but I knew I probably didn't get every baggie. Meanwhile, there are gawking members of the general public and several undercovers all hanging around watching my ridiculousness unfold. One of the undercovers demanded to see what was in my hands after I exited my car window and luckily I was able to show him there was absolutely nothing and I insisted I was simply searching for my keys. 

&#x200B;

The uniformed officer in her cruiser on scene though ended up being the primary for the call which is the only thing that saved me. See, this uniformed officer was a young black female who was without a doubt the NICEST most compassionate cop I've ever encountered in my life. Once I found out she was the one with my keys, I walked over and introduced myself and she handed me my keys and told me to park in a different spot so she could pull up alongside me. There's a glimmer of hope. She's handing me the keys and letting me move the car. 

  
I move over to a set of empty spots and a few minutes later after running my license (which was totally clean), she comes up and asks me to get out of the car. She does the same and exits her radio-car and comes to stand alongside me. The first thing out of her mouth is basically ""I could have your ass in jail and your car impounded but you need to get help and that won't do anybody any good"". We then end up having a 30 minute conversation about my schooling, my future, my addiction issues, life in general. Apparently she also has some types of mental health issues as well. The entire conversation was super positive and it was literally just her trying to get me to see how much potential I had and how scoring smack was ruining my life. She actually made me cry at one point.

&#x200B;

Early on in the conversation when I still wasn't 100% sure I wasn't going to jail, she asked if I was Jewish and I said I was half (total lie, but I was desperate) and then she talked about how a Jewish family had helped her family when she was growing up poor and how much respect and admiration she had for the Jews. Her face like completely lit up when I said I was part jewish so you could tell she really loves them (I mean who doesn't love the jews?).

&#x200B;

Once all was said and done, she asked me to get some Gatorade and food and wait a little while before I drive off and if she caught me scoring in this area again she would rip my ass apart. She wasn't going to arrest me or search my car or person or even issue me a citation. She just wanted me to be okay and to get better. She even told me the undercovers who were chilling were telling her I needed to go to jail for DUI cause I was too fucked up to drive but she said that was nonsense because she had an entire conversation with me where should could tell I was completely coherent and she had seen enough addicts and junkies to know when somebody was completely fucked. 

&#x200B;

I'm not gonna say I didn't finish the rest of the dope I bought (albeit MUCH more carefully) over the next few days because I did. But that was the last time I ever bought dope and part of the reason was the compassion of a young black female cop who genuinely wanted to help people be better instead of chasing crime stats by throwing every mofo she sees in jail. I owe this woman my life. ",1534956107.0

To the point: for over a year now, I've been toying with the idea of doing a piece of writing about the drug addicts in my city. My original idea which I've scrapped was a history of my city from the perspective of the alcoholics and drug addicts. That had an interesting angle to make it stand out from other similar articles in it's field. I don't think I could find the motivation now to research our past and corroborate it with the stories of the users though.  
  
So anyway, yeah. There are a small group of junkies that I really get along with, one of whom I've known since before I did dope and the others I've had a fairly close friendship with for a year or more. And I want to tell the stories of these people. Not just them though; we have hundreds of junkies around here, male and female, young and old.  
But unlike you guys in America, barely any of our addicts are well-presented, normal-looking working people to be honest. I know of maybe three of four who have jobs, and maybe two, and myself besides, who you wouldn't know was a heroin addict just by looking.  
They are mostly down-and-outs. I've seen two girls who I thought were Mmmm yummy-looking, funnily enough both since Sunday lol, and one of those actually asked for my number when I met her scoring off the same bloke two nights ago, and she invited me for coffee Monday morning but I didn't go and told her when I get money we'll go, on me. I don't like going anywhere with girls when I'm broke. 

 Butt damn! she keeps blowing up my phone, texting me a helluva lot she's so eager to meet. Maybe she wants drugs? she says it's not that lol but I'm sure it's not just my decent looks she wants haha. I actually know her boyfriend, who she informed me is in prison right now- conspiracy to supply? I think. Second customer of their first line was a copper haha.).  
If I hadn't lost my flat months back she would probably move in with me right now as that's the general idea of what she said the night I met her. All a longer story.  
Me and my ex are not actually together at the moment but we are having a daughter in December, and even if we weren't I know it would hurt her if I slept with someone else. Although, she gets over things pretty rapidly at the worst of times, hmmm. 

  
 Anyway I've gone fully off-track here, sorry guys (any advice lol)...
So yeah, I want to write an article focusing on the drug addicts of my city, but I feel like it should have some kind of angle to make it more interesting and readable, know what I mean? Like the first idea I had, that had the angle of being a local history following the lives of it's addicted inhabitants.  
I can't think of anything I could use to give this piece a unique selling point so I'm hoping you guys, the ones closest to me and my point-of-view, could give me your advice and opinions.  
  
Tl;dr: Read just the first and last paragraphs. I want to write about the junkies in my city. Can anyone help suggest a unique, interesting angle to make it stand out?   
Thanks!",1534948389.0

I'm done with it all, just over everything about it. It's been a fun and chaotic couple of years but I need to start focusing on the shit around me rather than my hedonistic and selfish goals. Their are to many thing's going on to just keep acting like I can keep acting the way I am and not expect thing's to go south. Met a lot of cool,sick,fucked up,innocent, and not so innocent people but it's time I started acting like I give a fuck about myself and the people around me. Which I sincerely do but I can't have my cake and eat it too. Might stop for a year or two till thing's level out or I might just not come back at all. Time for me to find something productive I can obsess  over that I actually enjoy currently thinking of a few things. I'll still lurk and post but I can't keep doing this to myself and to the people around me. If anything it's the best move, everyone I know is gone or I've lost contact with so that won't be a problem. It's finding an outlet for these urges that is gonna be the trick. But I'm not worried I know I can do this and for the first time I actually want this rather than be forced into it. Kind of excited to see what I can do now that I wanna get serious about starting to create a better version of myself. At least I got some good memories out of this crazy road I've been on. Much love guy's. Always remember no one is so far gone that they can't change as long as you have the drive you can do whatever.

Let me tell you why you may never be able to stop unless I tell u why,"If you had an amazing life let's say when you were clean for all your life and then you took opiates the first time let's say you took some percs or hydrocodone because I doubt a lot of people here went direct to Injecting, smoking, or  snorting..

First of all. When your an opiate virgin you will feel a come up taking it  orally but that feeling to you will feel like a rush. You will feel amazing but because your an opiate virgin, and you have amazing  friends, a place you love to live, a car you love, And a job.... The hydrocodone really is providing 10-20% of the high and the rest is your own brain being grateful about your own happiness in life and seeing and realizing very strongly how amazing your life is. Some people are like this others don't actually have the skills to understand why the drug is making them feel so good so they assume it's because it's just the drug itself providing 100% of the effects your feeling. 

But I promise you.... It's really just because it attaches to your opiate receptors and this activation makes you feel very good about the life you already have. If it's a good and happy and positive life, the high will be very strong.

But when you keep doing it let's say daily, first, tolerance goes up because 10mg now is no longer going to provide you the same effects first because the receptors it attached to broke off (not all but receptors lessen in the brain and become less sensitive), another reason is if you still take it to get that feeling you felt the first time, it's never going to happen, because you cannot just appreciate and be grateful for same things everyday. You think you can just stop living life and think you can take opiate daily and appreciate and love life based on what you have and felt a month ago the first time and since then you haven't even thought of doing or changing or improving ans bettering your life in anyway because you can do opiates and feel good....

No it don't work like that. Same thing with eating the most delicious food you've ever ate the  first time or listening to your most amazing song you ever heard first Time and then thinking  you can just eat th same food and listen to the same song every day because it felt so good when you first heard it so who needs something new... And the brain is very good at tricking you into believing that if this is the  best food you've ate in your life and let's say your 23 years old and this song out of tens of thousands of song you heard is the  best one, what are the chances you'll ever eat or listen to any better? So let m just eat and listen to the same thing and hope that this time if I eat a lot more or listen to the song in repeat and try real hard to feel and remember what I felt doing these activities the first time I tried it last month then for sure I can feel the same good feels again from the first time..


But our brains cannot enjoy th same things over and over... Because the receptors in our brain the felt those feelings already broke off and the new receptors arent the same and furthermore they're already coded not to be sensitive to th same exact feeling because if they did alwwys feels the same thing over and over humanity would literally die off. No one would want to do shit because they feel th same amazing high every day.

The  whole point and reason people keep doing it is to feel that same high they felt the first tim  whereas now they only feel a rush and feel good doing it because they know they will avoid the sickness and the body and brain having withdrawals like crazy mostly because its trying to adjust back into reality and the longer you've been addicted the harder th transition will be  because a 10 year heroin addict has essentially been inactive in life for 10 years. And the longer you go the more likely you will never feel the same high again. And opiates by their own don't really feel that good when you feel the physical aspect of it once you've done it so long that when you do even th fatest shot you only feel a physicql rush but have no actual joy in terms of thinkinf life is so good because you've done nothing at all for years have had no new experiences other than probably losing everything you had desperately trying to score another hit. You're life is no longer planning and living your life for a better goal or dream but just thinking day to day only...wake up, get more drugs, so long as I did that and maybe spent an hour two scoring then coming home and shooting I accomplished something today and I'm good and don't have to worry or think about anything because no addict can think about future goals or dreqms because as soon as they do not they realize there's no place fo any drug addiction in life when you Tryibg to become something unless they're thinking about becoming a dealer who uses his stash too.

And of course I'm sure the addicts including myself although I've stopped for a whlle do the drug and hope subconsciously since they forgot long ago why they kept wanting to get more in the first place (to feel the same magical high) and can't stop it because they always think today if I do it I may feel that high and when they don't plus they get sick when they don't do it they can't stop the cycle and really the only effect that is close to what they felt way back when they first try it is just feeling content you have the drug and did it and have it in your system so everything must be good. That's the onky aspect however abstract it is that remains even in a 10 year heroin Injectjng addict to the very first time they did an opiate. Why the drug felt so good th first time that part is gone and forgotten buried in the subconscious and only the abstract emotion of the contentment it brought is weakly there when a 10 year heroin addict shoots up in the morning or day or night ",1534899702.0

Chapter 3
Taste Profile

During my time working on the original OxyContin project, one of my most brilliant contributions was truly a sublime stroke of absolute genius. 

‚Äã‚ÄãI was, that is to say, we all were completely aware that the market would eventually discover that defeating the time release coating, crushing the contents, and insufflating (sniffing in laymen‚Äôs terms) would produce a high unlike anything the world had ever seen. Even the most hardcore heroin addict would be in awe of OxyContin‚Äôs euphoric flood and endless ‚Äúlegs‚Äù. Opiate naive individuals and opiate-tolerant addicts alike would bow to the clean, long lasting, serotonin tsunami that OxyContin would produce. With this foreknowledge, it occurred to me as I was letting an ibuprofen tablet dissolve under my tongue one evening in the lab when I sensed a vicious headache threatening to disrupt my work, that ibuprofen was sweet. The manufacturer had added a sweetener to the formulation. Not because sucrose would aid the action of the ibuprofen. No, they made the tablet taste sweet because they knew people like me would dissolve the medication under their tongue and find the taste pleasant. These chemicals do not taste pleasant on their own. In fact, they mostly taste so bad that we would do anything to avoid tasting them completely, if we had to do so. Anytime a pharmaceutical compound has a taste, especially one that is pleasing to the palette, it is by design. 

‚Äã‚ÄãWith that, I designed what eventually became OxyContin‚Äôs ‚Äútaste profile‚Äù. Ask anyone who ever chewed an OxyContin pill, or crushed and insufflated one, and they will all tell you the same thing: it had a unique and pleasurable flavor, even when dripping down the back of ones throat from the sinus cavities it had been forcefully inhaled into. 

‚Äã‚Äã
‚Äã‚ÄãThat was me.
‚Äã‚Äã

‚Äã‚ÄãOne may wonder: ‚ÄúWhy would a time released medication, a tablet designed not to have a taste at all, need a taste profile?‚Äù This is a fair question. The time release coating had no flavor profile, it was by design taste-negative. Only after defeating the time release coating and either chewing or insufflating the the powder inside the tablet, would one know the sweet nondescript flavor that is OxyContin. 
‚Äã‚ÄãOne may further wonder ‚ÄúWhy would the drug manufacturer put any thought into the taste of the compound when the only way to experience said taste was by defeating the time-release coating, an act the manufacturer would never condone, an act the manufacturer indeed would warn against performing?‚Äù
‚Äã‚Äã

‚Äã‚ÄãLet the record show this much: we always knew what people would eventually discover about our product; the ways it could be used and the ways it would be used. We considered all possibilities, we always do. We leave no possibility unaddressed, no stone unturned. This is our art and our craft; we are the gods of the world Huxley imagined: better living through chemistry.

‚Äã‚Äã
‚Äã‚ÄãMaybe, if I‚Äôm feeling generous before I reach the end of this dispatch, I‚Äôll share the ‚Äúrecipe‚Äù for the OxyContin flavor profile and those of you with a desire to do so can ‚Äútaste‚Äù the flavor of a lost generation. We will see how charitable I am feeling when I reach the end.",1534876854.0

'Look, honey, you can do whatever you want. Ultimately it's your choice. You don't have to and can't possibly justify it to me.""


""It's always been my choice.""


""And it will be again tomorrow. Remember that. So why even call?""


""Cause I... need you to know I love you. In case I don't get another choice tomorrow... Tell my family I said ""Good evening,"" anything else would just be too awkward fr them.""


""Oh fuck you. Love you too. Be safe. Please? Come back.""


My head is a swimming pool of kitty litter stuck on stupid. The xanax-gravity glob of impulsive randomness has long since settled in. I need this. It's me. Always was.. I was a a liar trying to run. She's cominh home. No. *I'm* going home. Yep.


I mix up what I'm guessing is a few points of crystal in my spoon with almost enough water. i can feel the anticipation buzzing up my legs., into my knees. Suddenly I'm bouncing my leg as I try and pull thick toxic goo into my rig. Naturally, it doesn't work at all, but it keeps my mind busy as I try not to think too hard and jinx my homecoming tonight.


**Over two but less than six hours later** 


My cupboards are bare, the fridge is halfway there. My neighbors will be lighting incense in the morning, because I won't even remember buying or smoking enough weed to last me two months. I'm fixing to go buy some beer from a long closed liquor store when my text comes through. 


""I'm here. So you actually wanna hook up or just another straight white dude invading my space for drugs?"" 


""Ha. fair question. I'm not gay though, or straight. I'm a hedonist. You'll see what I mean. But - even if I was straight I'd still blow ya if you really found that for me.""


""Yeah, my boyfriend says it's good. I'm on my way in. Never met a real live hedonist before. I have so many questions."" 


A short, petite native guy comes around the corner and stops dead in his tracks and turns to looks at me. 


""Not saying I'm nice, cause I took a few xanax. But I'm not dangerous.. Your call though.""


He smiles and walks up the steps, and next thing I know we're inside my living room.


""Be careful with this shit, okay man? It's not safe these days. I don't even know the fuck why you want it if you don't do it anymore.""


""I'm dumb as fuck. What's to argue?""


""You white boys are dumb as fuck sometimes. Why you guys love heroin so much?""


""Why you native kids like firewater?"" 


'Ha, fuck you man. That shit's your fault."" 


""Only directly. So that's a 30? huh? You weigh it?"" 


""No, but he owes me 30 bucks and he pissed me off so it's yours for 30. I don't have any more but that's worth at least 30.""


""Well that's more like $300. No joke. So he's gonna be pissed.""


""Shit, take it man. I still want that blowjob though."" 


""Ha, if it's real we'll talk about what this costs. You even old enough fo a blow job? You got any ID? I'm not even sure yo'u're 18. Creeps me out to be honest. Some fucked up kinda sting you goy going on here.""


""I'm 24 dick, I can prove it. And I think most cops would have beat the shit out of you by now.""


I mix my shot up in silence, he watches me and asks me where I get my rigs. It turns out, he's pretty familiar with my ritual himself. I give him a little dust to mix up with his next shot of clear, and by the time we're tied off and ready he's learned I'm a chef at a restaraunt downtown and he just graduated business school in the spring and is kinda.. living about as hard as a seasoned drug addict on a xanax driven two year clean celebration bender.


After our respective shots I wake up to him slapping my cheeks.


""White boy, i'm callin' 911. and takin your wallet if you pass out again.""


""Fuck off if you're gonna try to be my girlfriend. I don't need the drama take the wallet and go. Better leave the fuckin' smack though or run far, far away.""


A bright idea pops into my head, and without even opening his eyes it only takes a minute before I have his hard cock sliding down the back of my throat. I want him to feel as great as I do. He probably never should and hope he never truly will, though. This is scratching that itch of longing after pretending it wasn't real for years. Like a dog with fleas that itch is scratched, and I fade in and out of consciousness as I do my best to show him how carnally grateful I am for being such a cute delivery boy capable of keeping up with my bullshit.


A few hours later I wake up on my couch, and he's laying beside me in a light snuggle. I put my arm around him and pull him closer to me and thank him fo
r the bliss. 


""Your're really good at sucking cock, white boy."" 


""Don't call me that, native kid. And I'm good at it cause i like doing it. Especially when I get drugs for it.""


""Ha! So you're a prostitute now?"" 


""Sure. why not? You pay pretty well. You know your boyfriend is waking up about 250 dollars light tomorrow right? I'll give you cash to give him, and I promise he'll still be pissed.""


""No fuck him. He's a dick. It's really hard to find that stuff these days. I don't need to make it easier for him""


""Ha, ok man, just let me know when he flips shit, ok? I don't like being this guy. But it's really, really fucking good. So he's not getting it back.""


""I don't care he's a dick shut up and suck my dick again white boy. Ha!"" 


""Pay up anytime. native kid. You're a bottle of silver wolf away from gettin rolled before a night in jail. Remember that.""


""Oh fuck you white boy. Wanna see me drunk?""



""Maybe some day. On a date. Before a blowjob, like regular people.""

""I don't think fags should get married. We're all fucking insane.""


""The world is really. You're not special. That's the point. And don't say that word."" 


""It's our word. I can use it.""


""It's not my word. It's a word I heard a few times while getting my ass kicked.. until I learned to fight. And I'm not even gay. So, at least in my house, just a lil respect please? I grew up in a different time. I got harassed for having a gay friend. Before I was even a full fledged faggot..""

""You get your dick sucked whenever you want by a white dude. What's manlier than two men with dicks?"" I tell him as I unzip his pants again.


Now it's about 8 or 9AM Sunday morning, and the light is coming through the windows and I'm sitting naked and clean on a towel I laid on the couch trying to text a number but I keep thinking the words ""Two years>..."" and fading out a little more... I hear my phone drop.


""Wake up. You can't die high on Sunday morning, you're supposed to be in church. ""


""Fuck your god kid."" 


""He's not my god. He's yours.""


""Sure as shit isn't mine, You're the one spreading the gospel here. Go to church. I'm gonna get high and die and everything stops forever. I'll know peace, you'll know false hope. Luck.""


""Jesus fuck dude. Quit being so god damn melodramatic. Can I get a little more smack? Let's put down on speedballs."" 


""Goofballs. Speed balls are coke. No one know why but t's final. And I'm out of brown."" 


""YOU DID IT ALL?""


""Want your money yet?"" 


""Dude I thought it was really good, and way more than I thought..>""


""It was. Doesn't make it last much longer."" 


""How the fuck are you not dead.. are you trying to kill yourself?""


""Specifically now? No. I wanted to enjoy the smack. And I did. I'll probably go out in a car wreck. Or ground up alive n a meat grinder during an elementary school field trip to see how laws and sausages are made. Except nobody gives a fuck about where their food comes from anymore. Don't let me get into the legislative branch kid. I don't even give.....""

 
I open my eyes, and he's standing at the end of the couch with his coat and shoes on, and my wallet in his hand smiling at me. He tosses it onto my chest and sits on the arm.


""I can't even rob you man. You're fucking pathetic from wallowing in pseudo-intellectual self pity all day. Aren't you going to count your money?"" 


""I don't fucking care. I've been working about every waking hour this summer at my first head chef gig. All I have is money, and I don't fucking care about money anymore, It's the real killer anyway. It's only ever made me miserable one way or another. I live a very simple life to account for my hatred of money. You need some money? My house is a socialist paradise, really. We welcome business majors. Go ahead and enjoy the spoils of Marx.


""Well you can give it to me if you h so much Or you could buy more panties to keep around for all those badass bitches you must have over all the time. Are you trans?""


""Thought you liked my blowjobs? And you're gay, so I must be a man.""


Next thing I know he's got both of his frail little arms wrapped around one of my arms as he tries to hold me up and steer me forward and I instinctively follow.


""What are we trackin? Shit are we on the trail of tears?"" 


""I really thought you actually knew where we were going. Fuck you, too. You're two blocks from your house.. You drug me 
here. I'm bout ready to leave your racist ass in the gutter so you can hate yourself even more.""


""Oh! Jack. Fuck yeah kid, let's go get some weed. And a cup of coffee. And share some of this smack with him.""


""You did it all. See the puke down your shirt? Are we visiting him at the church? Cause that congregation might have to deal with this shit so I hope he's in it""


""He lives in that grey house across the street. Fuck them, those Pentecostal heretics will get theirs in hell. Hey, that's him on the steps with his head in his hands. Think he's waiting for us. And I can't be racist because my grandpa was half native, which makes me only part white. Now who's racist?"" 


**Some later point inside Jack's**


""So you're gay now?""


""Nope, sorry."" 


""Oh right, gay guys have more sense than to show up at mt my house covered in puke and waving to decent society attending church accross the street. But I suppose they might have called them all heretics. What the fuck are you on and why the fuck are you doing this to me?""


""I'm gay? At least, for smack. Like any decent person!""


""You got smack? Seriously? holy fuck""


""""No he did it all cause it was to much and really good it seems.""


""Wait... is he really a prostitute""


""Haha he's your friend, I just met him. He's fuckin crazy.""


""Yeah, I've never seen him get anything like this. He barely even smokes weed.""


More coming, this story's just getting started.  If you don't iike the gay shit you oughta try it next time you do xanax and black out because it's in your sub conscience now. Only way to get it out is to go read some Burroughs and sexually harass women in a bar.

994ryk,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/994ryk/how_can_i_help_my_girlfriend_with_the_withdrawal/,8,https://redd.it/994ryk,FishOdour,How can I help my girlfriend with the withdrawal of kratom and kolonopin?,"So, my girlfriend and I have four days we‚Äôve each taken off work. We took these days a few months ago with intent to go camping, but she mentioned an idea that popped in her head yesterday. 

She mentioned maybe taking those four days and getting a motel or long stay, and and staying there while she deals with the withdrawal effects of cutting kratom and kpins out. She has a history with heroin and uses kratom to ease the urges to use. She‚Äôs been taking kolonopin for her anxiety, but realizes it‚Äôs not a good long term solution and wants to get off them. 

She lives with her family so doesn‚Äôt want to deal with this at home, and it‚Äôll be easier if she‚Äôs not working. I said I‚Äôd be happy to stay with her and take care of her during. What can I expect? What can I do to make this easier on her and I? 

I‚Äôm not too familiar with this situation. I know it‚Äôll be ugly, so she says, and it‚Äôll be rough on her. I‚Äôve dabbled, with her, in using but I‚Äôve never fallen into addiction and haven‚Äôt experienced withdrawal firsthand.

i dont really know what to do, i know a place where people sell it but they sell their morphine to buy crack and these guys try to rob you by every way they can so i dont think its a good idea for me to go there

(Snowball) Have you ever...?,"Hi guys, so this just happened: I, being fairly new to them, had just done one almighty knee-trembler of a snowball for myself (do you call them snowballs or speedballs in America?) and a friend who has been a user for nearly 20 years with nary a vein remaining on her body was trying to bang her own.¬†
  
I saw her struggling and knew it must be congealed now so even if she got a vein, the elixir wouldn't pass through the eye of the needle. Crack tends to resolidify after standing around for a while, and actually I had no idea about that until a few nights ago.¬†Which is kind of strange since on one particular day preceding that night, I fixed up four separate rig-fulls of delicious, frightening snowball and had no issues with them getting hard while they waited to be picked next to enter my circulatory system. *(What's up with that?!)* 

  
So, back to the present day: I tried various methods of heating the liquid up to simply just get it out of the pin, but to no avail, so with a heavy heart, we threw it in the bin. She's not dependant luckily as she's on subs, otherwise¬†we'd still be fighting to make it IV-ready probably.¬†It was the last of our gear though so party's over for the night! ¬†
  
I did a few Google searches on the subject, finding only 2 relevant questions asked on Quora where the OP was questioning the safety and feasibility of banging a 2-week old coagulated shot of meth!  
One person, amongst his likely meth-fuelled words, came teasingly close to answering what I want to know: he said if you don't know how to get that thickened blood out of a syringe, you should reconsider your ability to IV and stick to other ROA's.¬†
  
So yeah, how the heck could I have gotten that shit out of there? My plan was then to heat it until it thinned enough to draw back up to have another attempt. ¬†
  
I wanna hear the stories you guys have regarding times your shots thickened until you couldn't use 'em, and what you've done or seen others do to salvage that precious medicine. ¬†
  
Thanks guys. ¬†
  
Stay safe and may you all be blessed with good dope or an easy, comfortable sobriety",1534864735.0
993ssc,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/993ssc/just_discovered_my_mother_has_been_steeling_my/,29,https://redd.it/993ssc,Myfamikysucksass,Just discovered my mother has been steeling my dad's pain meds,"So this is a throwaway because of obvious reasons. If you look in the post history of this account you'll see a detailed post about what's been happening in my family lately, but this post is about something different. My dad has had a bad back, been in severe pain, and been taking (a lot of) pain medication for about 7 years. He always hated the way opiates make him feel, so he usually takes less than he's prescribed, meaning he has extra. About 8 months he started having the issue of being low in his meds, sometimes even out, at the end of some months. Occasionally he would give someone in the family one for various things, but it was never anywhere near enough for him to have this problem. 

Me, being the 21 year old kid the finger was always pointed directly at me. He's occasionally given me his medication for a condition I have, but the second he started having these problems I stopped accepting them from him. My brother has been given them on occasion and complained about the way they make him feel. My mom asks my dad for them pretty frequently, for headaches, when she's sore, when she falls down (which happens pretty frequently), basically she's been asking my dad for his pills at least once a week for a few years now. 

Eventually I moved out (fairly recently), but still visited my parents pretty often, and because the pills still went missing, that finger was still pointed at me. I use some recreational drugs, occasionally even opiates, but my dad has been my best friend my whole life, I can't even bring myself to accept his meds when they're offered to me for my pain because I know it'll throw off his entire life by one dose, let alone steal them and force him to be in incredible pain. Yet, my dad still slightly suspected me, and my mom was sure she knew it was me. Arguments would ensue and she would yell at me, accusing of taking them. 

Fast forward to about a month ago. I'm not gonna go into too much detail as this is a very sensitive topic and I made a post in /r/dysfunctionalfamilies that goes into great detail about these events. My father tried to commit suicide. The only reason he didn't succeed is because my mom called my fiance and I to check on him, we managed to make it there in time to stop him from taking any more pills and call 911. Before the police/EMTs arrived he kept talking about my mom cheating on him. We thought it was just due to the large amount of meds he had just took, but we later discovered he was right. 

She had been cheating for awhile. Last night my dad texted me to tell me my mother told him that she wished he had succeeded and was dead so she could claim his life insurance policy. Immediately my fiance and I grabbed everything we'd need for a potential overnight stay (medications, phone charger, clothes, etc) hurried down there, a drive that usually takes 30 minutes took me more like 13. After a long talk with both parents (not important to this story, again details in other post) we decided to just try to sit with my dad and help him relax (mom had to sleep for worktn the next day). At one point I took one of my medications out of my bag to take it but I dropped it. I was sitting where my mom always sits and the bottle landed in her purse. I reached to grab it but I grabbed the wrong bottle. I realized this bottle had my dad's name on it. 

It was dated 4/2018, and it was MS Contin. Still giving her the benefit of the doubt I opened it up and looked at the pills inside, they were indeed the same 30mg morphine my dad takes....24 of them. Now I know she didn't take these all at once, this is just her stash, but that means my mom had been taking these pills from my dad since April. My fiance saw me with a pill bottle in my hand, assuming it was mine or hers, and put it in her purse. I don't really have much of a question here. I know I'm going to tell my dad, I know I'm going to confront my mom, I'm just pissed. 

I know opiates can make decent people do crazy things, but this is beyond crazy. My own mother was stealing pain meds from my dad, presumably to get high (she has previously and still does have an alcohol problem) and was constantly blaming me and screaming at me over it. I'm just having a lot of trouble handling everything. Sorry I guess this post doesn't really have a purpose.",1534863116.0

I seriously think my brain is more addicted to oxy like everytime I do 30s I withdrawal my face off.  When I do dope (which is rare) the withdrawal doesn‚Äôt seem as bad.  Why is this ?  Maybe because my brain doesn‚Äôt recognize it as much as 30s bc it acts a bit differently on the receptors...not sure but anyway.  My plan was to stop taking subs which is really tough the first 14 days so maybe try to let an 8th of H last that long and then transition to kratom?  Or something .. and then transition to completely clean.  I‚Äôm aware it probably won‚Äôt work and it‚Äôs probably going to be an excuse to get high when it‚Äôs all said and done but MAYBE not !  Has anyone done this ?  Success stories ?  Frustrating failure stories ?  Other unorthodox ways to come off sub ?  What do ya got for me ppl.  


Update it‚Äôs August 27th:  I‚Äôve been on kratom for 2 days ... only did H for 7 or 8 days because my connect screwed me (which I expected). I am taking opms gold kratom and it‚Äôs crazy.  This wasn‚Äôt the greatest idea I think it was an excuse to do some bomb ass H really because now even 3 pills of OPM and my skin is still crawling if anyone knows OPM gold capsules they are pretty much the strongest kratom on the market in my opinion.  They are also the most expensive.  I spent 150 dollars on 15 pills at my local kratom cbd store.  Not cool.   Part of me wants to get back on my sub but I feel like I have to punish myself for what I did.  Hopefully I stay on kratom and transfer to the cheap shit and take less than 7 grams total per day (which you still withdrawal on lol).  It‚Äôs not as bad in my experience though and it‚Äôs like when you want to quit your opportunity is there and possible unlike sub where it feels like you are locked in.",1534832416.0

‚ÄúSure, I have to be back to work at Ogelvies for four.‚Äù

‚ÄúCool. He‚Äôs back at Geoff‚Äôs. We have to get something out of his car.‚Äù

Minutes later my blue S 10 idled in the shade of Geoff‚Äôs gravel driveway. It was my beautiful blue truck until I forgot to put antifreeze in the radiator, then it was an immovable eyesore that the grass grew around in the front yard of Cheo‚Äôs house on Montoya. The death of that truck marked the death of my 8-month stint of sobriety. Well 8 months is what I told my parents and Cheo. It was more like 4 months, and I was smoking meth the whole time.

‚ÄúBob‚Äôs 73 years old and from Woodstock. He showed up earlier this week and flipped his car down a ravine 2 nights ago. The highway patrol said he flipped it at least six times and walked back up himself. A real miracle. He had to throw his stash and scale before he could walk back up.‚Äù I pretended not to notice that Bob was not his uncle at 73 years old. ‚ÄúWe just have to help him get something out of his car, in Questa.‚Äù

Before my hand came off the horn, an old man busted through the screen door with a bob and swing in his walk. He had an exaggerated limp. The racket of the door, swinging and creaking open and clacking shut mixed into his belligerent squawking. There was no one except us, but he made accusations. He muttered curse words under his breath like he was spitting in disgust and climbed into the passenger seat. Travis squeezed between us.

‚ÄúF***ing imbeciles! I‚Äôve never seen anything like it in my life. Just a pile of horse s***!‚Äù Over time, I would learn that this was his default. Ninety-five percent of the time, he was this way, unless you had some coke or heroin.

‚ÄúI know. I know. I talked to Geoff about it. He said he didn‚Äôt know anything about it and blamed it on Christine. I don‚Äôt believe it, though.‚Äù

Some drama I wasn‚Äôt privy to, but I found out later that his dog was missing. It was one of two times that Geoff and Christine had stolen and traded the old man‚Äôs pure bread Pekinese to Edward for coke, a diabetic drug dealer in a dirty double wide on the south side of town. He was unusually sweaty. His face looked like he was sucking a lemon, and the only hair he had was a werewolf patch on his right shoulder. Deep-pitted boils of brown covered his skin from his baldhead to the stained waistband of his shorts, and he sweat. His shirt was always off, and his health was always terrible, and he was always sweating.

Once after Eddie moved to the north side of town, I saw him getting wheeled into the emergency room. I spent a lot of time at the hospital back then, and since I knew he was going to be checked in for a while, my friend and I burglarized his house. It was blatant and my S10 ran out of gas a quarter mile down the highway. Besides the safe, with some silver dollars and a couple ounces of high-grade weed in it, the only thing I got was rinses out of his dirty heroin cookers. That was the main reason I broke in. We walked up to the Conoco and put gas into a milk jug with the silver dollars. His neighbors saw us do it, but Taos is a land of outlaws, and cops are rarely called.

Eventually the old man‚Äôs dog got eaten by coyotes, in the sage brush behind my house after he moved in with me. The old man had bad luck.

‚ÄúBob, this is Riley. Riley, this is Bob.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Indomitable Buffalo, they can‚Äôt keep me down! Buffalo Bob Cass! Pleased to meet you!‚Äù His tone and attitude completely changed. It was a show he put on; after all he was an entertainer in Woodstock where he lived before and used to do drugs with the bass player of The Band, Rick Danko. He even stood in for Levon Helm when he was sick, because they were both singers/drummers. Levon couldn‚Äôt stand Buffalo though. He thought he was a piece of garbage.

We passed a pipe full of green hash and coughed, crammed in the tiny cab. Bob coughed hardest. He was 73 after all, but when he coughed a weird sound came out of his chest, like a marble rattling in can of soup, probably from the wreck. Travis looked at me horrified. Bob acted like he didn‚Äôt hear it and took every hit he could. On his move to Taos, he stayed in a hotel in Iowa where the toilet broke in half while he sat on it. The water damage was so severe that they wanted him to go to jail. Somehow he lost his U haul trailer with everything he owned because of it.

As we finally got out of town, whatever heroin Travis and Bob did before they found me mixed with the hash to soften the lines in their faces. Their mouths hung open and their chins were on their chests. The silence of sublime sleep filled the cab, but for the hum of 5th gear. To the left a vast expanse of desert territory opened up and summoned my imagination. They said Taos was still the wild, wild west, so I listened for the busting caps of antique six shooters and the thud of arrows through the necks of cowboys, shot from the bare backs of painted horses. Somewhere in the distant dust was the war cry of dark men with long hair and a caravan of covered wagons burning. It was faint, but I could hear it before the road dropped into Hondo and back up towards Colorado.

Funny how people are when they ask you for something, especially junkies. Bob wasn‚Äôt Travis‚Äô uncle. He made it sound like his car was down the street or in Ranchos worst-case scenario but not 20 miles away in a different town. There was almost no way I‚Äôd be back by four. Travis nor Bob had any clue where his car was, not a number to call, not the name of a junkyard, nothing. It may not have even been in Questa, and I bet anything that whatever they wanted out of the car wasn‚Äôt in it anyway. But that‚Äôs how it goes for a junkie in Taos.

At a gas station we pondered what to do. Bob didn‚Äôt have any ideas. Travis was busy smoking heroin in the bathroom, and there are untold junkyards in Questa. Bob and I sat in the truck and smoked cigarettes waiting for Travis.

‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you go in and see what‚Äôs taking him?‚Äù It had been over 20 minutes, and when I walked into the gas station Travis was on an office chair behind the counter. His face was green and body doubled over. He held his gut with his hands.

Before I got back out the door an ambulance pulled up. They loaded him onto the gurney and into the back. It was a bad case of gas as far as I could tell from his diet of pure sugar and the irregular bowel movements of an opiate addict. A gloved hand grabbed a tube of lubricant and a rubber tube in the window, before they pulled away. I shook my head and walked back to the S10.

‚ÄúWell? What the hell is taking so long?‚Äù

‚ÄúAmbulance came and took him. He looked like his gut was in a knot.‚Äù

‚ÄúAmbulance? Really?‚Äù The truck was 15 feet away while they loaded Travis into the back, but somehow Bob had missed it. ‚ÄúAre you sure? I guess he won‚Äôt be coming back with us then.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. No, he won‚Äôt. Probably what he ate gave him a stomach ache.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat did he have?‚Äù

‚ÄúA giant moon pie and a bunch of orange soda.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, no s\*\*\*! What did he think was going to happen? Eating like that! F\*\*\*ing imbecile!‚Äù

Bob got silent and turned away as if he forgot what he said. He looked out of the passenger window, pensive and still, pondering some deep truth about life. Dark clouds gathered over the horizon, and the aura of heroin and his tiny pupils were peaceful, quiet for a moment. His long grey hair barely touched the collar of his leather coat. It was proof of the wisdom only 73 years of life can give.

The crinkle of cellophane broke the silence in the truck. He pushed it back before his dentures ripped a chunk of moon pie into his mouth. The gold handle of his cane rested on a 64-ounce fountain drink between his legs.

‚ÄúF\*\*\*ing imbeciles, I tell ya! I‚Äôve never seen anything like it in all my life. Well, let‚Äôs get going.‚Äù

I started writing about Bob as soon as he moved in. My plans were for a book. The first line went,

‚ÄúThe heartache. The headache. The stink of watery, green feces sprayed on the walls and puddled on my landlord‚Äôs carpet.‚Äù The carpet was new when I moved in. Brand new, and Bob ruined it. On top of my plans for a book about Bob, I had dreams of being a poet at that time of my life. It took me years to realize that I hated poetry.

He began to detox in a bad way, the beginning of a dramatic and obscenity-laden affair of about two months. He kept a welcome mat on the floor next to his bed, and I picked it up out of curiosity one day. Underneath were at least nine cigarette burns where the cigarettes had burned from end to end on the carpet, but the mat was also completely caked with green poop. Between the toilet and his bed, the green trail proved he was not well. There was at least one spray of lime green on the wall by the door.

Bob was a self-proclaimed junkie through and through. He knew it. He told so many stories of all the dope he had done and where he did it and how good it was and who he did it with. Those days were gone though, and 73 is not so kind to a junkie.

We were all dying like him. It was only more obvious that he was on his way out. Dead men and dead women walking, we looked for life in death, because staring death in the face was the only time we felt alive. Everywhere we went, our environments changed to match the death inside of us, but we lied about it to ourselves and to everyone else. None of us believed it, but we lied about that too and pretended that this was what we wanted.

We did meth and heroin and smoked cigarettes in his room, dubbed the shooting gallery. Bob needed a medical detox, but he had a habit of saying he was going in and not doing it. I dropped him off before a six-hour shift at Ogelvie‚Äôs one morning. When I came back to the house, I went into his room to find information on how to visit. But, he sat in his bed smoking a cigarette.

‚ÄúHow‚Äôd you get out of detox? Or did you ever go?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey kicked me out.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey kicked you out? Why?‚Äù

‚ÄúToo much trouble. They said they weren‚Äôt prepared for me. Too much s***ing. Too much runny nose. Said they didn‚Äôt expect me to be s***ing all over the place like that.‚Äù

On another morning I opened my eyes to see him sliding his thermal underwear over his foot. It was the first thing I saw, and the fabric got caught on his big toe nail.

‚ÄúCome on, you f***ing b***!‚Äù He screamed at his underwear and pulled harder. He ripped the big toe nail out of his foot.

I slept with a few different girls while I lived at that place, one named Luanne. Some people tell you they are bipolar, and others you find vacuuming your living room at 4 a.m., dancing to dubstep and smoking a bowl of weed but you know that they don‚Äôt do meth. Luanne was that kind of bipolar, and she spent the night with me sometimes. We were good friends.

I saw another girl who panhandled change in the parking lots during the days and had my mother‚Äôs name. She was beautiful in a weathered kind of way like some old momma you find at the pound, worn and scarred by the world but beautiful because of it. Bob called all my women by the same name: that f\*\*\*ing whore.

Anytime we went somewhere he would tell strangers of the abuse he suffered at my house. It was humiliating and largely untrue, but one hipster kid bought Bob‚Äôs line and sneered at me for my inhumanity. He would take Bob to his house in Tres Piedras and care for the old man as any decent human would. The guy made a big show of how altruistic (one of Bob‚Äôs favorite words) he was and what a disgrace I was. Travis and I laughed so hard that we had to put our hands on our knees to keep from falling on our faces.  
The next morning, I found them in the hipster‚Äôs Nissan in the parking lot behind Tazza. Bob sat in the passenger seat with an unlit Native 100 between his lips and acted excited to see me, too excited, like he needed something, like things weren‚Äôt working out with the hipster. ‚ÄúHey, Riley! I‚Äôm so happy to see you!‚Äù ‚ÄúHmm‚Ä¶. Are you now, Bob?‚Äù ‚ÄúOh yeah! Extremely.‚Äù He turned to the hipster in the driver‚Äôs seat. ‚ÄúHey, you, where in the f\*\*\* is my phone?‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know where in the f\*\*\* your phone is! It‚Äôs your phone! Why don‚Äôt you keep track of it?‚Äù I agreed with the kid. It wasn‚Äôt his responsibility, and they yelled some more before the old man came back to my place.

Bob got healthier while he lived with me, and my heroin habit grew. He put on weight and got his bodily functions under control for the most part. After two months it was time for him to leave, and he had a place rented in El Prado. I packed his stuff into the back of my truck, and for some reason he called me a, ‚ÄúF***ing piece of s***! You know that? A real piece of s\*\*\*!‚Äù

After all I did for him I had it. I had only ever touched him with care and concern. All the times he went to the hospital, I visited him. When he came back from a CT scan, I patted his head and held his hand. At night before he slept, I washed and rubbed those two petrified pieces of mahogany he called feet and lathered them with tiger balm, but now I had him by the collar and my fist cocked back behind my head and bit my lip. ‚ÄúOh what? You‚Äôre gonna hit a sick old man are you? Bet you feel real tough! Don‚Äôt you boy? You‚Äôre real tough now!‚Äù I threw his boots into the back of my truck and took him to his new place. My back tires sprayed him with muddy snow and gravel when I tore out of his driveway.

After he moved out, my manager at Ogelvie‚Äôs, Tiffany asked me about him.

‚ÄúHe said, he thought he was bothering you a little bit or something.‚Äù

‚ÄúA little bit?‚Äù We both laughed.

He had been in on a Saturday afternoon to watch his Iowa football team play Ohio. Tiffany said he kept walking around the place ‚Äúgrabbing himself.‚Äù She called me to come watch him, and in case things got crazy I could take him away.

Ogelvie‚Äôs fired me for acting goofy when I came out of the bathroom and wearing sunglasses to wash dishes and the weird film that collected in the corners of my mouth and for obnoxiously ranting at customers. A week after that I defaulted on the rent at my place. When my landlord came to see me, we talked for 30 minutes in the cold next to the shattered front window while addicts lurked around inside. He was nice about telling me I had to go, but when he left I found a loaded syringe behind my ear. The weather had already cracked the engine block in my S10.

Before I moved out Bob called me to tell me he broke his hip and that he was staying in the old folks‚Äô home by the hospital. We hadn‚Äôt talked since the day I almost punched him, so I went to visit him.

‚ÄúYah! Fell on the ice on the road up to my house coming back from the movie store.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat did you rent?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know! Some s\*\*\* flick about a hit man. Whatever it was, it wasn‚Äôt worth shattering my hip. That was it, though, when I fell. I couldn‚Äôt do anything, and it was getting dark. The neighbors drove around me and up to the house to watch the news! Can you believe that s\*\*\*? Drove right around me lying on the ground! I could have died!‚Äù

I smiled. It seemed hard to believe, but unbelievably bad things always happened to him. Now he graced the nursing staff of the geriatric ward with his red faced, foul mouthed, screaming accusations. More than once, they caught him rolling around in his wheel chair smoking weed in the hallways, while he pretended that the pictures on the wall were fine art. When he didn‚Äôt get what he wanted from the staff, he messed himself and rolled up to the nurse‚Äôs station and demanded that they take care of it.

‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre not dead, Bob. I missed you.‚Äù

‚ÄúMissed you, too, Riley. Missed you too. How‚Äôs that piece of s\*\*\*? What‚Äôs his name? Timmy? Can‚Äôt stand that mother f\*\*\*er. When is he going to get where he can take care of himself? I mean. He‚Äôs only 38.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù He was referring to my buddy who had been living at my house since before Bob came around. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know where he‚Äôs going to go. I don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôll go for that matter.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean? Are you getting thrown out?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. I decided to buy some coke last month while the rent money was in my pocket. You know how it goes.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. Yeah, I do. Haha. F\*\*\*ed yourself didn‚Äôt you?‚Äù He showed his dentures with a smile.

‚ÄúYup.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I won‚Äôt be home for a while. At least another month. You can stay there and help me out when I get back home.‚Äù

‚ÄúAwesome! Thank you!‚Äù

‚ÄúJust one thing, Riley.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah? What‚Äôs that?‚Äù

‚ÄúLeave Tim wherever the f\*\*\* you found him in the first place. The last thing I need or want is his sorry a\*\* at my place. Lousy piece of s\*\*\*.‚Äù

I moved into his house a few days after Thad stabbed me in the face with an umbrella over a handful of Xanax that I stole from my friend‚Äôs leukemic landlord. Despite all that I had going against me in terms of reputation and appearance in town, the black scabs on my face embarrassed me, because they made me look less than sophisticated. Looking sophisticated was the least of my worries, and while Bob was in the hospital, my new friend Johnny and I tied my mattress to the hood of his car to move me and Tim and Tim‚Äôs dog into Bob‚Äôs new place.

Johnny and I used to tear through Taos in his white Lincoln Town Car with two other kids while I projectile vomited out of the passenger window. Both of those kids are dead now. One jumped from a cliff escaping imaginary and malevolent figures. The other overdosed and got left in his car at the ER one night. They found him dead in the morning.

Other times Johnny and I hung out with an older nurse who hated me until we shot cocaine together. Then she stripped down and danced and sang for me while Johnny and I laughed at her. She never noticed that I wasn‚Äôt into it, but that didn‚Äôt matter. She was into herself.

It was common to watch her mix way too much cocaine with way too much heroine in the same shot, and ten minutes later she bragged about how she only ate granola because Fruity Pebbles were so unhealthy. She told us about a house she had in Ranchos that was haunted with a patch of red paint that bled through multiple new coats over several years. Eventually she had a dream in which all the details were disclosed about a 19th century abortion involving a teenage girl and a priest in that bedroom. I tried to contact her about the story, but she‚Äôs dead too.

Bob ran Tim and his dog off as soon as he got home from the hospital and fell in a pile of his own feces soon after that. He had gotten mad at me about not giving some syringes to Johnny in an episode of dementia and yelled for help all night long after he fell. I let him sit in it until the morning, even though I couldn‚Äôt sleep for his yelling. It was how heinous I had become. He struggled to breathe for several days before we took him to the hospital, and it turned out that one of four broken ribs had punctured his lung. He snuck his IV out of the hospital when they released him, but when he pulled it out at the house his blood was black saw dust.

Sometimes I had fits of furious passion in my bedroom and banged out reams of nonsense on my electric typewriter like a maniac firing a machine gun. Sometimes I decided that the world was ending and that I would die soon. Then there was no point in writing. Sometimes I wouldn‚Äôt even get out of bed and chose instead to watch the squares of white sunlight slide slowly across the floor and up the wall until I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore and had to get up to figure something out. Sometimes I yelled at my dog from all the stress Bob caused me.

I forgot that I even had a dog, until now, but I probably wouldn‚Äôt have told you about him anyway. My career as a dog owner was a disgrace, and I thought if you hated me any more than you already do, you might stop reading. Not that my neglect of the old man two paragraphs before this one shouldn‚Äôt make you hate me enough to stop reading, but these days people seem to value animal life more than human. Let me tell you about my dog. He was a good dog.

It was Thad who brought him to my place after finding him in the KTAO parking lot some months earlier, and he was mostly heeler, what we called a Taos Cattle Dog. We named him Serio, in part because he seemed serious and in part because Sirius is the dog star. It fit well, and he understood me perfectly. He would leave at eight in the morning and return at night. He could sit, stay, lay down, get on the bed, get off the bed and anything else I asked him to do. He never went to the bathroom in the house, except this time I screamed at him in my bedroom, and he pooped on my bed. It was clearly intentional and made me laugh because I deserved it.

When I moved from my old place to Bob‚Äôs, I overdosed on anxiety meds and left him outside of Smith‚Äôs grocery store. It took me several days to realize that he was missing, and when I did, an empty leash tied to the railing at Smith‚Äôs was the only thing I found. Serio showed up at Bob‚Äôs the next morning, even though he had never been there. It was an amazing feat and endeared me to him more than ever.

Now, I can‚Äôt remember if these last few paragraphs are about my dog or the electric typewriter my dad gave me. Either way, they were both destined for doom like everything else I cared about. My typewriter slid slowly off my bed even though I could have stopped it, but I was too depressed to move. The impact shifted the keys, and it never worked again. Serio was taken from me by another local drug addict, who was better than I was. He accused me of neglecting the dog but shot him for killing one of his chickens a week later. Such was my life and everything that I touched.

‚ÄúEverything the warning labels on prescriptions say not to do, is everything you want to do!‚Äù He laughed with his dentures out like he was channeling my old friend Bobo. With tears in his eyes, he told me of entertaining back when he was Buffalo Bob Cass and made crowds swoon. Every time he died and went to heaven some ‚ÄúAbe Lincoln looking m\*\*\*\*\* f\*\*\*er‚Äù sent him back saying he had to come in the front. That he couldn‚Äôt come in the back door.

Once, he woke up in a refrigerated room under a sheet of plastic. His clothes sat in a bag on his feet and he had a toe tag. He got dressed and found dope hidden in his waistband. The whole hospital was frantically searching for his missing body, while he snorted drugs in a bathroom stall. His friends already had all his stuff and were squatting in his apartment when he walked up. A soothsayer in Woodstock told him this was his last incarnation and that he was paying the price for the evil of his past lives. These were the stories that he told.

One day he watched Yolanda, Garth the dope whisperer‚Äôs girlfriend, open his window and hang her belly over the sill before she slid onto the floor. The lights were off and she supposed that he was gone, but he watched the whole thing from his bed a few feet away. She came for the flat screen. Bob slapped her in the head with his cane and used his walker to escort her to the front door. That was Taos when I knew it. Your friends robbed you and talked bad about you when it didn‚Äôt work out for them. He sent me to the bank to pull 40 bucks out of the ATM and get some cocaine one night, but I took 300 dollars out of his account and never came back. The year‚Äôs last snow had still not melted.

When I was homeless the next summer I would end up at that desert oasis in Ranchos called Taco Bell. Inside I would stare at the walls painted purple and red to make it look less cheap and listen to the soft jazz. The dropouts working the counter understood the plight of life in Taos and let me drink the cold Baja Blast with a water cup. I pondered life and what could have been and what was not. Tourists stopped in to eat as they passed through town. Their kids complained that their sister did this or that and wanted to know the next time they would swim in the over chlorinated pool at the hotel. I would close my eyes and imagine that I was one of them on a road trip with my family in late August. Back to school commercials offered deals on binders and loose-leaf and pencils on the hotel TVs. Anxiety put knots in my stomach when they played, and I could feel it all, like I was there, like I was 11 years old again waiting to start the 6th grade. Then, I would push the door open and walk the highway miles back to the Albertson‚Äôs parking lot looking for a fix.

The last time Bob and I spent time together was right when he got out of the hospital again, a year later. We had not talked for a long time, but I knew where he lived, and I knew he was in the hospital, so I moved in. I was renting the front room out to Johnny and his junkie girlfriend who drooled on herself and always had 4 or 5 spoons on the kitchen counter with streaks of soot and the scattered pink crumbs of pills she called fast 5s. One of her eyelids always stuck halfway shut, and she paused several seconds between every word. They didn‚Äôt look very fast, but who was I to judge.

Bob was happy to see me anyway. That was the life of a junkie, even at 75. You go to the hospital. You get out. Junkies are living in your house, and the party goes on. My girlfriend, Danielle, put the light bill in her name, because Bob owed money to the company, and he asked us to. But when he made us mad one day I threw a big box TV at his feet and busted the white powder all over his floor. Danielle and I went and turned the power off on the old man in the middle of winter to collect the deposit. It was the last time that I ever saw him, but not the last I heard.

A year later, he called me from Miami where I suppose he died. Years later in the foyer of a church, a woman asked me if I had a grandfather who passed.

‚ÄúHe wants to tell you hello.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou mean you talk to dead people?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy friends are passed over.‚Äù She said, as if calling them dead was politically incorrect.

‚ÄúOh, well, I didn‚Äôt know my grandfather. I don‚Äôt know who it could be.‚Äù

She struggled to get the deceased‚Äôs name, but could not come up with it.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll let you know if he tells me his name. He says he loves you. He says you went through a lot together, and that you were in a bad way. He said he is proud of you, for doing so well. Very proud.‚Äù

She walked back over to her table, and I forgot about her. My girlfriend and I talked at our table. She said she thought contact with the dead was evil. I had my own opinions of how that worked and explained. The lady stood up suddenly and screamed,

‚ÄúBOB!!!!! He says his name is Bob!!!!!! He loves you and, he is so, so proud of you!‚Äù",1534821638.0

I didn't think I'd fall. I stick my feet in the rabbit hole but I always pull them back out... no big deal, right? For then, yes. Each day passes and just a touch more drugs are done. But I work! But I go to school! But no one knows! I'm fine, I'M FINE! Anyone asks when I'm under the weather, ""I'm fine"" I say, but I am sick inside. I'm very sick.   


It was just hydrocodone. I was a kid. A stupid fucking kid. It's no excuse. But where in D.A.R.E. did they teach us to worry about the pills the doctor gives you? My class missed that chapter in the 4th grade. But I threw it up when I got my wisdom teeth pulled, so I threw them in a drawer. A car accident at 18 and more pills.... more of the same thing I threw up before. So into the drawer they went.   


I was about to turn 21. My friends were all coming for a bonfire. We were going to have drinks and then go out in a bus. My mom was baking brownies for my friends. She asked for my help and thought I was fuckin' with her and didn't feel like helping... ""Little ungrateful bitch"", I hear as I climbed the steps because my stomach hurt so bad. Not my stomach, lower, my ovaries actually, but I didn't know that yet. I crawled down the stairs in tears an hour later, my mom apologizing and rushing me to the hospital. 

  
The doctors ran their tests, promising me pain relief ""just after one more test"". This was after 3 or 4 but whatever, they're the doctors, not me. Finally an internal ultrasound, which was basically a dildo with a camera on it, poking the SHIT out of my ovaries. I cried and cried but at least they found what they were looking for. Finally, because they found the source of the pain, a cluster of ovarian cysts, two of them being baseball sized and already rupturing cysts, I could get some relief.   


Now this is where the funniest and also worst joke of my life comes into play. My mom tells the nurse who is hooking up the morphine to my IV. ""She was supposed to celebrate her 21st tonight with friends"" she tells the nurse. The nurse looks over at me, still doing her job, ""Happy Birthday, hun"". My mom continues ""We had to call off everything, but I guess now instead of saying she had her first legal drink on her 21st, she had her first shot of morphine.""  I didn't laugh. The nurse didn't laugh. My dad chuckled a bit. I probably would have if I could have, but the pain was too much. I would have laughed too, fuck it. They monitored me overnight, when the pain stopped, they sent me home with a few scripts. ""You still have two golf ball sized cysts there... speak with your family physician, they'll get you on hormones to get to those other cysts before they rupture, but come back in a month so we can be sure they've negated in size rather than the latter.""   


My dad said he watched the whole time. My dad is inherently good. Wonderful. He had ""The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly"" on my shit hospital TV, he said he hurt, watching me literally writhe in pain, he'd never seen that before in all his years, he was 55 or so at the time. But he said he watched, he watched the morphine drip in with the water... he watched the TV but paid more attention to my movements... he watched them slow and slow as the morphine dripped in. ""How are you feeling?"" he asks halfway through the movie. ""Like shit"" I reply, ""But better, at least maybe I can sleep."" ""Try"" he said, ""try to sleep."" I drifted off and he said he watched my body lie still, finally at peace in his mind at least, and just as one of our favorite movies was about to end, in comes the nurse ""We need to send her home, and we need this room."" she tells him. ""But.... The Good the Bad and the Ugly is just about to end, can't I wait with her and finish, then we'll go?"" What a fucking guy. My dad is amazing, that is a thought I will never let go. He didn't get to finish the movie. He grabbed all my belongings and put it all in a bag, I left in hospital socks and two hospital gowns so I was covered. They wheeled me to the exit and a nurse stood with me while my dad pulled up the car. My mom had left hours prior. ""The pharmacy on x block will be open 24 hours and fill this for her"" the nurse said to my dad as he lifted me into the car.   


We get to the pharmacy, it's not my usual as my usual isn't open at 4 in the morning. My dad is inside waiting for my prescription, but I don't feel right, I open my door and lean out the car. I throw up for a few minutes, mostly dry heaves, and stay there, slumped over, head in my hands, hospital socks somehow still clean. ""Did you throw up?"" It still makes me laugh that he asked. ""No dad, it was the coyote"". He looks at me confused, because the joke doesn't make fuckin' sense... ""yeah Dad, I just threw up but I'm okay"". He closes my door gently and get's in the driver's side. He puts the script in my bag of clothes, rubs my back while encouraging I put on my seat belt again, I do so, and we get home safely.   


My mom is awake and comes to hug me, I hug her back and tell her ""I need to go lie down"" so they help me into my room comfortably and set all my stuff in the corner. I tell them I'm just going to sleep, that the pain is gone, and I just want rest.   


The pain is gone. It's GONE the next morning. I feel great. Like it didn't happen. I go to clean my things stacked into the corner of my room. I put everything away but one thing.... a script to a bunch of hydrocodone, I guess in case those other golf ball sized cysts rupture before I get on hormones or in my case, birth control. I toss them into the drawer with so many other pills, all the same. Maybe different colors and different letters, but they were all the same. I start to wonder about them. As time grows, my curiosity does too.

  
One night I had a headache, a migraine, the kind that pounds until you can't keep your eyes open but still can't sleep. I say fuck it, I try the pain medications I was so carelessly given so many times before. I'm not sure at that moment that I THOUGHT, I kind of think I just DID. I grabbed two like they were motrin and that was the beginning of the end. I caught a nod my second time taking a pill and I discovered the Wonderful World of Painkillers. But I thought it was just that.... I thought it was just a painkiller... I wasn't really sure on what they could DO or BE.  

The only thing I want now is to get off heroin. I want to get off heroin and I want to be that person that gets to tell others the DANGER of taking a pill prescribed by a doctor. DO YOUR RESEARCH I want to scream to the world. I grew up in a home without drugs. My parents didn't even know. When they finally found out I was using... they were SO confused. They were so ANGRY, and all I thought was, how can you be SO angry when you handed them to me? I'm glad opiates are a more well known term now and that more and more people know what that shit can lead to. But I wish my family and I had been that educated years ago...  


Now I move carefully each day as to not get into trouble. ""Don't get caught"" I tell myself every day. Just last week I thought I was going to jail. I had an unpaid ticket because I was in an accident, the cop said I'd get my ticket in the mail because his printer wasn't working? Whatever. I didn't seek that out. I was late for work the other day so I pushed it a bit too much and got pulled over. My fucking dumb fucking ass. Man I saw those lights behind me and as I shoved my heroin literally up my vagina, I plead with myself in my head, don't have a warrant don't have a warrant don't have a FUCKING WARRANT.   


The officer is at my window. H secured in my vagina purse, and both hand on top of the wheel. ""Stop your car and give me the keys"". I do as asked. ""Where are you going?"" I mutter ""work"", ""And from?"" ""my home on x block, officer"". ""Why were you speeding?"" I reply ""I work in 3 minutes"". He tells me ""Well, I guess you're not getting there on time today, huh?"" I can barely breathe. He says he'll be right back. I know my fate. A jail cell where the HOPEFULLY don't strip search me. And if they do? Jail eventually, most likely. Not a holding cell, JAIL. I wait forever it seems. I see the officer coming back, a ticket in his hand. I assume it means there's no warrant, and I almost cry. He steps up to my window, ""No more speeding okay? We don't want someone to get hurt.... you are shaking a bit though, sure you're alright darlin'?"" I admit it, ""no officer, I'm okay, just spooked by police in general you know?"" I force a giggle, trying to seem normal. He laughs too, and says ""Yeah, that happens, I understand. Don't take off now until you're okay."" I don't think I've ever met such a nice officer before, but then again I am a young, white female with sad eyes so I am almost guaranteed an easy ride in this world.   


This world is so fucked. I got lucky last week. I've been lucky my whole life, actually. The reality is.... I'm the luckiest of the unlucky. That's what I tell myself. I am A Functioning Addict. I am Invincible. But the truth is? Anyone can fuck with me and win. I sometimes just.... get lucky. ",1534796482.0

I know there are multiple factors to consider like what's in your stomach at the time, metabolism, etc, but for those of you who use or have used both ROAs, what would you say the average time you feel high is one vs the other.

Today I also watched my friend die from a hit and run. Thinking of relapse.,"A group of friends and I were walking out of the Molly Hatchet concert when a car blew past a red light and hit my friend going about 50 miles per hour. I watched his body fly through the air and him land in a contortionist like position. Needless to say, he died on impact. I don't know what to think or feel. I've never witnessed such a vile and brutal crime right in front of my face, especially with one of my best friends involved. I also am 2 years sober today, but I'm struggling to not call up my old Dboy. 

Appreciate the ones closest to you, and don't take them for granted. You never know if or when it'll be the last time you see or speak to them again.

RIP Socks

Anyway, I had a friend who got into heroin years ago and she'd occasionally crash on my couch. Before I knew she was using I noticed a distinct change in her body odor. It's hard to describe. Almost metallic but mixed with a very light sweet combined with musky. That still doesn't do it justice really. It's just a very heavy odor that you can almost taste. It's not BO. Not garlic or vinegary. And it wasn't for lack of showering as she'd take two a day at least when she was at my place.

I didn't think much of it until I ran into a guy yesterday who said he was an active user. And there that smell was again. Slight metal mixed with a hint of sweet and musky. EXACTLY the same as her. I also haven't seen that friend since she got clean so i don't know if that's still a thing for her and I certainly wouldn't ask her, because I feel it's just best not to bring up those days.

Is this a thing? Googling isn't turning up a whole lot and I don't hang with that sort of crowd so I only have these two anecdotal points.",1534767417.0

I checked a comparison website and it said that morphine is generally 1.5 x stronger than oxy, so the 60mg is equivalent to 40mg of oxy. 

Has anyone taken morphine sulfate and how does it compare to oxy?  Does the SR mean standard release? And for the ER pills is there anyway to make them instant? And lastly are you able to cut the SR In half, if it is not scored?
