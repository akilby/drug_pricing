A few days ago I saw a post saying u/theycallmebigdick (Greg) had sadly left us. Attached to this post was a song. I have listened to this song every day since reading the post and so I decided to write out the lyrics for you guys.

And I gave you all my trust.    
Oxidised it; turned it to rust.    
There's a human being    
That just couldn't handle what could have been.    
Maybe if you said some other words instead    
Then I’d have a life and I would not be dead.    
    
No I don’t think that it was free.    
I feel like it took something out of me.    
No I don’t think that it was free.    
I feel like it took something out of me.    

You said that I manipulate,    
I fear you wrote down the license plate.    
Sirens go off as we ride,    
My heart stops for a second and I think I died...    
...At least inside.    

No I don’t think that it was free.    
I feel like it robbed something from me.    
No I don’t think that it was free.    
I feel like it took a big old part of me.    
    
Fear the men in blues at my door.    
Now I am thankful for evermore.    
This institution with no solution    
And no I don't think you have the right to take me away.    

No I don’t think that it was free.    
I feel like it took a big old part of me.    
No I don’t think that it was free.    
I feel like it took a big old part of me.    

PS. Did Greg write anything else?

I am just feeling really down lately. I am addicted to prescription meds, mostly hydrocodone and oxycodone. On average I use about 180mg of hydro, or 120 mgs of oxycodone a day.


I have been wanting to get clean lately. I have been depressed, and even the opiates haven't helped me feel like myself. I think quitting is what I need. So basically my sources are going to be dry for a few days, and my bank account is almost in the pennies. Two days ago I took 50 mgs of oxy, and yesterday I had another 30 mgs. I probably shouldn't have done that considering I'd be on day 3 today, but I am here stuck on day 1, again... I am hoping the withdrawal will be somewhat easier now that I have reduced my intake so dramatically. Or, it might now matter at all. Anyways, I hope once I get a week or two in that I won't start chipping again thinking I am in the clear. I do that shit every time, and then I find myself back to daily use. 


I am in a midlife crisis basically. I am just about to graduate college. I have tons of student loans to repay, credit card debt, no savings, and a few items in the pawn shop. I have no job lined up. I can move in with my parents while I search for a job, but the thought of that sucks (even though I love them to death). I just feel like a loser. All my best friends (real friends) from high school have their shit together, big boy jobs, and a gf. I am a closet addict, not getting any younger, with no significant other, or no real plans for the future. 


I feel like throughout my use I lost the meaning of life. Sometimes I don't even see why I am alive, or what I am working towards because I don't seem to care about any of it. I have contemplated suicide, and the thoughts seem to be occurring more often than not. There have been times where I would pop xanax with my opiates thinking idc if I wake up as I drift into sleep. I just can't do that to my family, as much as it would be a relief to me. Sure, I'd love to have a family, kids, a nice home, and whatever else the american dream is... But , in reality I don't feel like that is possible for me.  


I also have sleeping issues. I literally need a substance to put me to sleep, and this has been a problem before my use started. I am scripted Ambien, but that just ran out. My health insurance runs out in 29 days, and I will be without until I get a job that provides one. Some of you might say I have it good. But I promise you I would trade anything I have to just be happy with myself. 


Opiates fucked up my brain permanently. I have taken them since I was 16 (25 now), when I had no clue what withdrawals were. I had no idea what I was doing to the wiring of my brain. My usage progressed slowly, and my tolerance got bigger as time went one. When I started snorting dope for a few months, it just skyrocketed my tolerance once I went back to pharms. I just can't deal with this shit anymore. I'd love to wake up and cook breakfast, instead of immediately swallowing pills and waiting for my body to stop aching. I am always torn between the quick 4hr fix, or the long-term toss up of hopefully being successful. 


I am pretty much a daily reader of this sub. I have an alt account, but I wouldn't want to post this sob story on my real account. I guess I am just a pussy, and too worried about where I should be in life instead of just taking it as it comes. I love all you guys, and know that all of you have gone through more than most of what any one in society could endure. Opiate addiction is a bitch. I wouldn't wish this problem on anyone. I wish every single one of you happiness, whether is be from dope, or life itself. I too, hope I find happiness somewhere out there. 


For whoever read this whole thing, thank you. I have nobody to share my thoughts with, and I thought typing this out would help. Take care, guys and gals.

I mostly snort, but I was smoking it when I could, too. A few months ago my wheezing, coughing and breathing difficulties became markedly worse than they had been before. I went to see a doctor and was referred to a specialist with a long waiting list. 

Well, a few days ago, I woke up in the middle of the night and I flat out couldn't breathe. Like, at all. And I hadn't had any dope for about 10 hours, so it wasn't related to that. Panicking, I managed to call emergency and gasp out my address, then stumbled onto the front porch, dropped the phone and started to black out. I could hear the lady trying to keep me on the line but I couldn't speak. Suddenly the paramedics were there and rushing me to hospital.

I was put on oxygen and given blasts of nebulisers every 2 hours, given IV cortico steroids to reduce lung inflammation and given x-rays and blood tests, etc. I couldn't even stand up without losing the limited ability I had to breathe all over again, even with the oxygen mask. They confirmed what my doctor had already suspected; I had Pneumonia, an incredibly rare, nasty type that can be caused by smoking heroin. The steroids worked wonders but it's a gradual process, it's going to take me a long time and lots more steroids to properly recover. 

I tell ya, guys and gals, it was a pretty terrifying experience, compounded by the dope withdrawal that set in after about 16 hours in there. Spending a night writhing on the bed in WD in the respiratory ward with an oxygen mask on trying to breathe, listening to the sounds of these old folks in their 80s and 90s wheezing and groaning was a uniquely nightmarish experience and enough to scare me off smoking anything for a while. I'll never take breathing for granted again. I thought I was dying that night I had to call the ambulance, I almost suffocated.

So I just wanted to give any heavy heroin smokers a heads up; if you experience noticeably bad wheezing, a cough that gets uncontrollable whenever you're not high, and increased difficulty breathing, seek medical attention before it gets too bad, and, of course, lay off the dragon chasing.

tldr; contracted rare type of pneumonia from heroin smoking, had a harrowing hospital stay including WD.",1446383572.0

Second red flag.  Whilst blanketing up for the long haul, [shaking like the twerking in this video](https://youtu.be/Hp3TADuP0iU?t=28s) (except not nearly as sexy...lmao), and [my body tensing/locking up like someone casting ICE 3 in Final Fantasy VII.](https://youtu.be/BwQfEkDXE80?t=13s) To make matters worse, to go along with the moaning like I'm in heat, being as tense as I was and the level of pain I was in due to the spasms was akin to [Edea slamming me with an Ice Shard during the parade in Galbadia during her Coronation](https://youtu.be/AtnnWfpWJGo)  
  
Now, on to the solution. Though I very rarely, if ever, ask my mother for one of her pills. I'd rather be sick (Oxy IR 30mg) I had to break down and do it. I just couldn't take the shit any longer. It was pure hell, worse than any cotton fever I've had in the last year...I haven't had an issue with it in months, but it happens, an unfortunate side effect of IV drug use. It's weird how it can happen within minutes if injecting, or in the rare, one off occasion like tonight, a couple of hours later.   
  
The good thing is that I've explained it to her before and she understands just how bad it can get. It took her a minute to realize just how bad it was for me, but she kicked me down. The cotton fever went away almost immediately, but it took me freakin' forever to prep my shot with how shaky and tense I was. I was worried I was going to spill it. Bonus points for the half of a 30mg Oxy IR I found underneath my headboard when I bent down to pick up a cigarette I dropped..it must've been there forever and scraped up against shit, because while it was a decent size half, the markings were worn off and it was extremely brittle for a pill. My mom is fucking awesome, and it makes me sad as fuck seeing her go through the shit she's having to deal with right now, but that's an entire story in itself, and I chose to leave out the personal details with her and my brother here on the main sub.

https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3qxgvp/is_iving_worth_it_after_getting_high_by_sniffing/cwk7unj

Basically, I did a 2 bag shot as my first time IV'ing and barely got any rush or high. I was told that even with my 8-10 bag intranasal tolerance, a 2 bag shot would still knock me on my ass, but I simply did not find that to be true. 

So here I am, with 4 bags left, trying to figure out the most efficient way use them in the next 15-20 minutes. My current plan is to do a 4 bag shot. In my earlier 2bag shot, since the syringe filled up with lots of blood when I registered and there's no pain/bruising at the injection site, I'm pretty convinced that I did the shot correctly and successfully, and that my tolerance just prevented a 2 bag shot from doing anything. 

Anyway, if anyone out there can comment on what you think happened and/or how you think I should proceed with my next shot, I would be extremely appreciative. When doing the shot, I did feel a very slight rush of warmth and my head got a bit heavy, but it was hardly noticeable to be honest. Everything else points to the shot being successful.

You have a situation. It doesn't mean that is has to be accepted. People like that are individuals who believe they're entitled to something that no one else is. Not *one* other person. Like, for real, what the **fuck** people! Own up to the fact that you're an addict, an alcoholic, a fucking degenerate! Don't necessarily be proud of that, but the point I'm saying is don't try to blame other people. Don't think people owe you anything. No one owes you anything. The only person who owes you anything in this life, is ***yourself.***  
Just like this older dude I used to work with... he would say to us younger people that we were the ""Age of Entitlement"". I would always agree with him. ***What the fuck***, people**!** Get your shit together and stop thinking everyone owes you something. I won't get into my life, because it's probably boring to a lot of people, but I will say that I didn't come from humble beginnings. I got my ass beat when I was younger. My parents, my aunts, heck, even grandma. I ***did*** have a rough child hood. I really, ***honestly*** did. 1 of 9 children is ***not*** fun when you're all getting yelled at and beat to shit. I have worked extremely hard to get where I am in life right now. It's not the best situation, but it's improving.  
**Every. Single. Fucking. Day.**  
Next year will probably be my best year I'll have. At least up to that point in life. Lol, I hope I have better days after that. Anyways, what I'm saying is that I don't blame my abuse of anything on anyone.  
Anyone but:  
***MY-SELF***  
I understand I fell into this lifestyle by my own actions. Actions where I had choices. I take full responsibility for making those choices and taking those actions, because it has influenced how I am, how I act, what I do, and especially - Who ***I*** am. My friends, we all need to take responsibility for our actions. The choices we make define who we are. Not the fact that we might have been beat. Not that we were called motherfuckers, or pieces of shit. No - it is nothing like that. It is what **we** did. It is time to stop blaming others for your poor decisions. Whenever you are doing something great, or something is making your life awesome at the moment, do you say it's because of others?  
**NO!***  
So why say it when **YOU** have made bad decisions**?**  
  
  
  
***PLEASE*** **PEOPLE!** Let's start owning up to ourselves. Are you ashamed of yourself? Please, don't start the pity party. I'm not proud of some things I have done / do, but it is what it is. I ~~might~~ have flaws, but I am in ***NO*** way in hell embarrassed or ashamed of myself.  
Please, please, please - try and remember that you're not perfect, nor are you going to be perfect, but guess what? **NO ONE** else is!! Please, come back down to Earth and start realizing you have a great life to live and amazing things to accomplish in life.  
  
  
That is all. Thank you for reading this in it's entirety. I really do appreciate it. I hope not everyone took my venting out personal. The people reading this who think they might be that person - they are. I hope they take some good from this, and not try to turn this against me, because that is ***exactly*** what that type of person would do.

I've read that Etizolam, along with other thienodiazepines, will therefore produce effects very similar to traditional benzodiazepines. 

However, nothing really touches on what the substitution of a thiophene for a benzene ring really matters. Does this have any impact on the pharmacology? Is there any clinical significance whatsoever in the type of 'ring', benzene or thiophene, is attached to the diazepine ring? Or is this an physiologically inactive and analogous to a binder/filler in a pill?

Lastly, I assume combining 'thienos' with opiates should be treated the exact same way as combining benzos with opiates?

I am from a well educated middle class family, and have aspirations to go study at higher tertiary levels after my exams.

My questions are:

- How frequently do you need to be using opiates to then experience withdrawal once stopping?

- How do you determine dosages relative to tolerance and last usage? How quickly does opiate tolerance develop (I felt 35mg was too much and almost knocked me out completely, but thought that stepping it up that much from 15mg for my first time was necessary due to the rate at which I thought opiate tolerance developed)

- What rules and guidelines should I have in place to ensure that I do not fall into addiction (I will have a LOT of free time on my hands after exams and don't want to fall in to something like addiction)

- What indicators does one use to suggest where they are on the opiate cycle? (e.g.. addicted ---> heavily addicted)",1446346512.0

Def more than 30 days old. So i took 1 bottle (still felt a little guilty i guess haha) for rainy days with no opes and i wanna have fun or for when i had a blue or op to try that combination. Never really fucked with kolonopin b4 just xanax as a benzo. Did a couple this week on a couple occasions. They felt ok but i was smoking with them. I popped em.

Any advice about how i should take em and how many to feel great? Or just any helpful info/experiences. I wanna pop/rail some before i head out to grab.",1446337250.0

    Not a user myself but I am trying to form an educated stance on drug policy and I figure input from current users might be a helpful thing to consider.  My opinion, so far, is that all recreational drugs should be legalized and regulated by the government.  Marijuana is fairly easy to agree on and it's clear that it will be legal federally within 10 years.  Heroin, on the other hand, is not even considered by the mainstream as something that should be legalized.  The reason why I believe it should be legalized is its illegality is not an effective deterrent.  People who choose not to use heroin (such as myself) choose not to because of the consequences of addiction, health risks, etc., not because it's illegal.  Instead of imprisoning users, we should offer treatment for people who are addicted if they want it.  Also, the sale of this drug by the government would eliminate scumbags who cut the drug with rat poison to turn a higher profit.  Also, this would undercut the current suppliers who use violent practices to get rid of resistance and competition.  As consumers of heroin, without being too selfish and actually thinking about the greater good of society, what bad impacts might I be overlooking?  Or is this actually a good idea that you agree with?",1446326382.0

I got woke up at five in the fucking morning because of of our fucking little Mexican friends got himself thrown in the drunk tank. Apparently he told the cop he wasn't his dad and it wasn't curfew yet. But before we went to get him I clogged one of my last good rigs, so I couldn't get properly high. Not to mention the 12 million times i stuck myself AND flagged, but it'd slip out. And ive tried buying some at 3 different pharms with no fucking luck. Fuck me. 

Then, on our way to the car, I stepped in dog shit, which I didn't realize until it was on the gas pedal AND the brake. So I had to clean up dog poo in the fucking jail waiting room, which of course made the room stink after I threw the napkins away the COs gave me.  Afterwards, I try to go back to sleep because it wasn't even 7am and I was already in a bad mood but homeskizzle comes in and throws the keys on my chest and says we gotta go. So I've been driving pretty much since 8am. I've also had to drive to the same place which is 30 minutes each way THREE FUCKING TIMES. Like bro, bulk, man. Bulk. Quit wasting our 4 hours of our day and pissing off YOUR customers because you have poor planning skills.

Now my phone is doing some hocus fucking pocus shit and not letting me get all my texts. So I'll be waiting on a text for an hour, just to get like 15 of them that all usually end with U THERE? Like, if its THAT important, fucking call me. Don't send me 12 messages of the same fucking shit. But Im also not getting texts from people I WANT to fucking talk to and I don't want to blow their shit up and annoy them if they haven't texted me back. Yay social anxiety. 

Anyways. Hope your day is going fucking better than mine. I'm gonna so sadly sniff a lot of dope and waste way too much because I have 0 rigs.  Fuck. ",1446322145.0

So i'm from Australia; the land of over priced drugs. And was a dope / Oxy addict for a good 3 years. I've currently been on Methadone / Suboxone and now again Methadone the last 2 an' half years. I was on 80mg and have my made my way down to 10mg. Yay nearly off, So i'm at the point where i can start chipping again.

But our heroin is very very expensive; approx $150 for a ""Quart"" (2.5 points) and the purity is probably less then in the US. 

But our chemists are very generous with OTC opiates. 

So i strolled down to local chemist and picked up the following items:
1 x Bottle of DXM Syrup
1 x Pack of 25mg Promethazine
1 x 40 pack of 15mg Codeine / 500mg APAP
1 x Bottle Of Rikodiene 200ml (Contains 380mg Of Dihydrocodeine and A LOT OF sorbitol which can cause a literally pissing out of your ass. aha )

So my combination went as followed;
T+0 Took, 30mg of DXM and 25mg of Promethazine
T+35 Took 400mg of CWE'd Codeine 
T+1h5 Ingested 380mg of Dihydrocodeine 

I have to say the high is fucking excellent, I was nodding hard and the body high was really strong, along with the euphoria. Comparable to say 60-80mg of Oxy although very different high.

 The promethazine also got rid of that irritating histamine reaction that comes along with the codeine. 

the codeine clogs you up enough to counteract the effects of the sorbitol. so no explosive diarrhea and no constipation. 

Overall a fantastic experience for all OTC supply's.

I'm a diesel mechanic who is also a certified escort driver, which means days where I'm not working on a big greasy fuck, I drive around.
My boss wasn't around, so I decided to head into the bathroom and do 2 bags. My tolerance was very low cause it had been a while since doing any dope. I come out of the bathroom feeling like a million dollars, only for my coworker to tell me the boss called and I need to go meet him upstate, about 2 hours away. I've never been to this place and driving in a commercial vehicle means I can't take the parkways, which is what the gps wants me to do. Whatever, I'll figure it out.
I get on the BQE and head over into the Bronx. Just as I go through the toll on the triboro bridge, I feel the nausea I have come to love. Almost immediately I start projectile vomitting out the window. People are honking, there's chunks on my mirror and all down the side. Whatever, I feel better I'll keep going. 
My phone dies shortly after. I turn on the CB and start trying to get directions from truckers but no ones answering. Fuck. Pull into a Dunkin donuts to get a coffee, directions, and do another bag.
Half nodding I end up passing my boss and coworker about 20 minutes later and my boss goes on the CB to tell me to whip a u turn and catch up with them. I do so right there and my boss starts cracking up saying how crazy I am etc. 
All is well from this point on, until we pull over and the boss hops in the truck with me. What's wrong with you he asks. You look weird. I tell him nothing I'm just starving haven't eaten all day etc. He says good cause we're going to get lunch. He takes me and my coworker to a Chinese buffet and tells us that it's on the company, so pig out. God damn I ate like a king. At least 7 plates filled up. All is great.

To begin, I am currently in Drug Court. This morning, Around 9:30 AM, I goofed and insufflated half a bag of dope. I immediately regretted my decision (immediately = about 15/30 min later) and began blowing my nose, spitting any drip, doing everything I could to do an emergency evacuation on my nasal cavity. I had something I had to take care of, so I wasn't able to deep clean with saline until about two hours later, but ultimately I did blast my nose with an absurd amount of saline. I know some of the dope still crossed over because I certainly felt it, but I know it was far less than I consumed. I'm now drinking PLENTY of water, have taken some metabolism boosters i.e. B complex, Raspberry Ketone, other ""Fat burners"" (i have a fast metabolism to begin with, also), have taken a shot of apple cider vinegar and will be taking some midol for a diuretic. I also plan to do a fair bit of exercise today. My concern is that, being on Drug court, I may have to drop tomorrow. IF I do, I can drop as late as 4:30 PM. I do not want to have to dilute, if possible. Though, if that is my only option, I'm not opposed (it'll result in a 24 hr sit in the clink but it's better than actually dropping hot imo). How likely is it that I will come up positive? Are than any other tips for cleansing? Was clearing my nose ASAP a wasted effort, or is it going to work in my favor? 
Again, I know I am a fool for having slipped up in the first place, and I take full responsibility for it - But if I have a chance to make it through this with no problems, I'd (naturally) like to know.

I have $2500 bills and rent is $500, I make anywhere from $4000 to $7500 a month selling cars. Where the fuck does it all go!? Oh YA, up my nose. That's when I realized I was a junkie....when talking to a customer with my nose running and dripping and instead of thinking of the sale I was thinking when I could get them on a test drive so I could go to the bathroom and snort another pill....kinda ranting here but curious as to when you knew you had lost control. Also, for my fellow Canadians, how did you get on Suboxone? I love in BC and it seems outside of the Lower Mainland its imposible  to find a sub Dr. Thoughts on methadone vs Subs?

After I hit in my right hand that arm has been slightly stiff/achy up to the shoulder and the veins on that arm are very slightly popping out.  Like stiffness and stuff throught the whole arm not just the injection sight.  Any idea on what could be causing that? And I didn't miss, I've missed in my hand before so I know what that feels like.

So I've been out of the game for the most part for a while now and recently picked up some dope. I've never had much of a tolerance to opiates even when I was shooting occasionally, like Id almost be nodding from iv'ing 4mg of dilauded.  Lately all I've been able to find is percocet and vicoden and I've been getting high as fuck off of 30-35 mg of oxy.  I recently got back in contact with an old friend though who could score some dope and hopped right on that offer. He's physically addicted to the point where it takes him 140 mg of oxy to get well if that's all he can find.  

Me him and his middle man all go to pick up and I watch him do his shot so I can attempt to gauge how much I should do. His cut of it was enough to get him well and a mediocre high so, wanting to be safe since I haven't had anything in weeks and haven't iv'd in months, do much less and get almost nothing out of it. I re-dose a few times until I have a mediocre high and am tired of poking myself for the day(keeping track of approximately how much i did).  So today I load up around 1.5x that amount and notice that its about 3/4 as much as he did so I made sure to push very slowly in case it was too much and again I'm met with a fairly mediocre high. 

Keep in mind that a slight amount more was enough for someone with a much higher tolerance than me (it all came out of the same bag too) and that my tolerance to opiates has always been fairly low. 

Do you guys think that I might have just an unnaturally high tolerance to heroin in the same way that some people just starting out get rocked off 10 mg hydro but need 30 mg of oxy for the same effect?",1446524992.0

""I destroy homes, tear families apart - take your children, and that's just the start.
I'm more costly than diamonds, more costly than gold - the sorrow I bring is a sight to behold.
And if you need me, remember I'm easily found.
I live all around you, in schools and in town.
I live with the rich, I live with the poor, I live down the street, and maybe next door.
My power is awesome - try me you'll see.
But if you do, you may never break free.
Just try me once and I might let you go, but try me twice, and I'll own your soul.
When I possess you, you'll steal and you'll lie.
You'll do what you have to just to get high.
The crimes you'll commit, for my narcotic charms, will be worth the pleasure you'll feel in your arms.
You'll lie to your mother; you'll steal from your dad.
When you see their tears, you should feel sad.
But you'll forget your morals and how you were raised.
I'll be your conscience, I'll teach you my ways.
I take kids from parents, and parents from kids, I turn people from God, and separate from friends.
I'll take everything from you, your looks and your pride, I'll be with you always, right by your side.
You'll give up everything - your family, your home, your friends, your money, then you'll be alone.
I'll take and I'll take, till you have nothing more to give.
When I'm finished with you you'll be lucky to live.
If you try me be warned this is no game. 
If given the chance, I'll drive you insane.
I'll ravish your body, I'll control your mind.
I'll own you completely; your soul will be mine.
The nightmares I'll give you while lying in bed.
The voices you'll hear from inside your head.
The sweats, the shakes, the visions you'll see.
I want you to know, these are all gifts from me.
But then it's too late, and you'll know in your heart, that you are mine, and we shall not part.
You'll regret that you tried me, they always do.
But you came to me, not I to you.
You knew this would happen. 
Many times you were told, but you challenged my power, and chose to be bold.
You could have said no, and just walked away.
If you could live that day over, now what would you say?
I'll be your master; you will be my slave.
I'll even go with you, when you go to your grave.
Now that you have met me, what will you do?
Will you try me or not? 
Its all up to you.
I can bring you more misery than words can tell.
Come take my hand, let me lead you to hell.""

 So I hit up dboy and he says he'll be back in about 15-20 minutes, but he'll have someone serve me at the trap. ""C"" was gonna serve me; Previously C had shorted me 6 Roxies, so I decided to count the entire bottle in front of him. ""C"" starts giving me shit for doing so and says I'm burning the spot. As soon as he was about to say something else, we hear the door knob turn and he shuts up. ""C"" goes into the bathroom and dboy walks into the house. I continue counting them as dboy watches me. He asked me if it was on ""point"" and I told him I was short 11.  
  
 Dboy stayed quite and C walks into the room to hand dboy the cash. Dboy immediately hits the guy in the face and I swear you heard his jaw pop on second hit. Dboy then started to pin him down on the floor. C started to cry and ask what that was about, dboy replied, ""Don't play stupid nigga, ayo Keys how much are you missing this time?"" I replied, ""11,"" and dboy starts to unloosen C's belt and takes his wallet. He hands me the belt and says, ""whip this nigga like the bitch he is, 11 whips alright Keys and whatever he shorted you the other time."" I felt bad, but at the same time I was pretty pissed off and ended up whipping him 17 times in the back.  
  
The story doesn't end here, dboy tells C, ""You gonna be my slave now nigga, you know how many people you shorted? I had to go explain some shit cause you. Remember big dude? That's baby momma's brother."" Dboy gets on the phone and he says, ""Come in."" Next thing you know, this gigantic Mexican comes in, and dboy asks him, ""How many?"" Big dude replies, ""32."" I was thinking to myself ""OMFG"" and dboy says, ""Keys, it's gonna get bloody"" and finally excuses me. I feel bad for C, but at the same time I wanted to know if I was ever going to get those 17 Roxies back...

She set me up with a guy who has been pretty good, always answers my calls even early in the morning, is pretty timely, and from eyeballing it the weights seem right to me. Quality is decent. Downside, he's very paranoid, insists on speaking in code, he's hard to understand because of how ""ghetto"" he speaks (which is fine by me, I just literally catch every other word out of his mouth.) He also kisses me on the cheek several times in the 2 minute transaction, and slaps my ass on the way out. Oh well, at least I'm not sick while she's away. So today, he wasn't answering, which was really weird. Today was the first day of my new job I'm really excited about, as a vet assistant (I'm in school to become a Vet Tech.) It's not a job I can afford to be sick at, grueling 12-13 hour shifts with no sitting or downtime and more than one or two bathroom breaks is frowned upon. He's not answering so I resign myself to a sick rest of shift/day. Fast forward to my lunch break, when I was hoping to pick up. My new coworker gave me 5 dollars to go get her Taco Bell since I was going to pass one on the way back to work. Her change was 1.35, and I had 89 dollars, so I dug around in a purse pocket I hardly use to get some quarters for her so I could keep the paper dollar. I feel some change, pull out my hands to see what I had and literally screamed out loud when I saw what I was holding among the quarters, nickels, dimes, and pennies. 4 8mg dilaudids were staring at my dumbfounded face. Further digging in that pocket presented a total of NINE DILLIES and a bonus 5mg flexeril. And then right towards the end of my shift the guy got back to me.

I realize some people might think I shouldn't bother trying it or that it might throw me off getting clean.

Info:  6 months sniffing.  Tolerance has been the same for 3 months.  40-50 mg single dose intranasal (snorting) every 8 hours.  I calculated my IV dose somewhere around 20 mg but I need confirmation/advice.  Thank you.

Started off as a weekend thing where just half a 30mg Oxy would have me nodding like crazy, to needing anywhere from 3-4+ to chase the Dragon. This past weekend was incredibly boring for me. I didn't go out and had no desire to do anything, even play video games. I've also been clean for about a week and half cuz I spent all my money on about 20+ blues the week prior, which at this point feels like an eternity since I've been without them. Sunday night rolls around, and as I'm getting ready to go to bed, I stand up from my chair, and the middle of my back is in excruciating pain. I don't know what I did to cause it. It's not like I stood up too fast or anything. The only thing I think could have caused it was earlier, I almost slipped backwards due to wet sandals because of a wet carpet from rain a couple days back. My left leg/ankle hurt quite a bit after almost falling, but I recovered. My current back pain hurts the most when I try to bend over to pick something up, and my left Achilles tendon hurts so much.

I guess the point of this post is to just address how much it sucks, when you actually do need opiates for pain, and you can't even get them. Have to wait until Friday payday to go pick up. Hopefully, everything hurts less by then. Thing is, I was hoping to quit this time around too, but it seems every time I try, something like this comes up.",1446503202.0

Mainly, how serious the stigma is behind using drugs. On here, on this site, I can feel free to talk about my biggest exploits, my most embarrasing moments, and real low times in my life without worrying about everyone judging me and calling me a piece of shit, because weve all been there, or at least close, and if not we at least know that drugs dont make you a complete failure/waste of space. Im finding out in the past couple weeks, that no matter what, if you are a junkie and yer surrounded by sober people (or even cokeheads/alcoholics/pill poppers, ironically), you are automatically a bad person and should not be around for any reason, period.)

I am learning this now because, well for the past 3 years, I have been working in aggriculture in a very small town in Nor Cal, and it has been a great 3 years. making lots of money. the first year i was on pills for a small amount of time, the second year i was on pills heavy the whole time and a little H, and this year i have been using H heavier than i ever have in my life, and low and behold, this year, the whole valley is thinking about 86'ing me from work. Im hearding second hand of course that no one wants to work with me, witch is the real reason ive been out of a job i was promised, and possible out of the whole job next year. Things have been going missing from one of the houses the workers stay at, so of course, it was me, the junkie. According to my bosses, im a liar, a thief and i cant be trusted. also none of the workers want to work with me because they are ""afraid of having their ipod stolen"".

As im sure there are many of you who understand, drugs dont make you a bad person. which is why this is so hard for me to understand. I have done nothing but bust my ass for these people, and helped them out as much as i had the chance, going out of my way for numerous things, but no matter what i do or how good i am to them, all they want to do is talk shit and fuck things up for me because im such a ""piece of shit"". its really upsetting.. i could have done more to hide it but i just feel like thats not the right thing to do, hide who you are from people, its just not honest. so i didnt. i didnt go around advertising my usage to people but i didnt deny it either. plus in such a small town, word travels faster than the speed of light. so the minute my addiction came to light, im no longer wanted in this particular valley. 

the most ironic part about it is, the last two bosses i had were the biggest bosses in the valley, they were also serious tweakers/alcoholics, totally unstable and fucked up people. Two of them (a cokehead and a tweaker)conspired to steal over $120k worth of merchandise from me last year. something no one batted an eye at. yet, me, a heroin addict, allegedly stole 1500 worth from someone, and now im considered a piece of shit. I just dont understand why the stigma with dope is so fucking bad compared to the stigma behind meth and coke and alcohol. i know theres also politics involved in this certain situation but even outside of this, it seems like no one who suffers from addiction is worth a goddamn minute of anyone elses time... just really erks me because i try my hardest to do what i can for people and this is what i get in return. just for being who i am.

I can't think of how to describe it. But this used to happen often with oxy in the very beginning and now Is happening again and super annoying I did about half a bun normal amount maybe slightly more and the 3/4 a bar. When I normally only take 0.5mg xanax (prescribed for before bed) so I should be out cold. I'm thinking maybe a little coke was on my straw from earlier today. But I used the straw 2 times between the coke and my goodnight bags. 

Anyway. My problem is that I lay down and try to sleep but rather than sleep and my mind go blank/dark and not dream or dream where I'm in no control I very actively am dreaming from the start. I've lucid dreamed plenty of times and this is different. Its almost like I am just daydreaming constantly without going deeper to sleep. It's so annoying. I need to be up for work tomorrow. I took so much downers im going to be exhausted no matter what anyway. But I close my eyes and I'm back at work cleaning tables talking to managers.  But I'm in control and can not lose the control which is annoying because it's not sleep and relaxing to constantly lucid dream. Also my dreams seem to happen in real time too. So I will be dreaming for a half hour im at my work (I had a really annoying stressful day) and a half hour of time goes by. I just want to sleep. This happens a lot like I said on opistes.

Pulled over with a lot in your car? Parents find out? Work find out? Post up them stories let's read em'. 

As for me. 

1) This must have been around 8 years ago or so. I think it was my sophomore year of college during winter break. I am back home. My brother & I hit up a nearby party. I was only like 22 or so at the time & the little bro was 19. To preface this, it was the last time I ever drove while being under the influence of even a sip of alcohol. Anyway, at this point of my life I was a simple pot head who drank occasionally. I didn't do any 'hard' drugs at the time.

Back to the story. Once my brother & I got to the party everyone was passing the word around that there was a DUI checkpoint on a street right near my house that I would most certainly use to get home. There was another way to get home so I wasn't worried about it at all though.

Couple hours later & I'm headed home with my brother. I only drank 2 beers, but I was high as a kite & so was my brother. 

You can imagine what my dumbass did. Yeah. I drove right to the checkpoint. I remember being out of it, but that quickly changed when I realized what the fuck those lights in the distance were & what I had just done. So at this point I have no choice but to get through it. Someone can correct me here, but I figured turning around before a checkpoint would look mad shady. Here I am, 22 years old, black 92 mitsubishi eclipse with tinted windows and decals,  2 ounces of weed in my trunk, 2 beers in me that only boosted my killer high, a drunk & high 19 year old in the passenger seat. My life is about to change for the worst. Back then weed was dealt with much more strictly & the location I was in meant that 1 oz of weed was like the equivalent of kilos of cocaine lol.

Anyway we get to the checkpoint. I roll down my window. I don't remember the exact exchange, but at one point the cop asks me, ""Why are your eyes so red""....My brother, out of no where yells ""We've been playing Madden all night on X-Box""....

I'll never know why, but the cop simply told me to head on home. I know for sure he could realize we weren't sober. Looking back, that night could have changed my life drastically. EA Sports, it saved my life!

2) This is recent. I'm on break @ work. I head to the bathroom to do my business, and by business I don't mean shitting, I mean snorting H. Anyway, my job has a lot of employees so the bathroom is always busy so when I'm doing my thing I need to at least pretend like I'm taking a shit. So after I snort my line I just sit on the toilet browsing reddit. I realize I need to be back on the work floor in 5 minutes so I quickly get my things together, pull my pants up, and head back to work. I only had 30 mins left on the clock. I had just bought a gram and had the next 2 days off so was excited to head home and relax. I keep my stuff in an empty chewing tobacco pouch. Anyway, when I get home I  open the pouch and low and behold the fucking thing is empty. Now I am panicking. Where the fuck is it!? I was going absolutely berserk. I raced back to work and searched the bathroom to no avail. Thinking back on it, I had forgot to put the gram bag back in the tobacco pouch somehow. So basically the gram bag must have fallen through my pants and out the bottom. Where it actually came out I will never know. At the time I was so nervous that it might have fallen out on the floor at work (which has a ton of cameras), but my guess is that it fell out in the bathroom and some janitor had a sweet weekend since nothing ever came from it.

This compound, ibogaine, is an extract from the iboga plant, a hallucinogen used in initiation rites for men in Africa. Ibogaine assisted therapy is legal in Mexico, Canada, and more, and has great results.

Now here's where things get interesting. We had just gotten off work and headed to his car. Now we're in the car prepping his tin foil and straw and I'm sitting there DJing in his car thinking ""oh I've popped oxy 40s I'm gucci"" never in my entire life have I been more wrong than this time. We start smoking it and he's helping me and I'm hitting it like I was chiefing an entire blunt to myself. About 5 minutes pass and we're grooving hard to some music driving to pick up our boy Irish.

Now it's the next morning and I text my friend telling him I got home safe and that I'm feeling better, and this fucker says ""I was surprised you didn't throw up more because you were hitting that 3 times every time I hit it once, like you were fucked up!""

3rm0z3,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3rm0z3/sketchiness/,21,https://redd.it/3rm0z3,WhyNoUnbearablePain,Sketchiness,"Seems like some among us get an almost equivalent rush from copping and narrowly avoiding run-ins with the law as from the drugs themselves. 

For me, though, the sketchiness inherent in being an opiate addict is one of the shittiest parts by far. I have anxiety already (part of the reason H feels so damn good...thanks cruel universe) and I'm always getting worked up imagining the worst case scenario when meeting up with someone to buy or driving with drugs in the car. 

Just today I had to meet a Dboy I haven't been using for a while, but my regular guy (who usually delivers) wasn't getting back to me. It was pretty standard fare: meet in a parking lot, drive around the block while we do the exchange of dope and money, etc. But the entire time I was just imagining getting pulled over, or someone in this relatively small town recognizing me while this slimy looking dude gets in my car, etc. And the amount of times I checked my rear view mirror on the way home, just wondering what the hell I would do if I saw flashing lights...god damn.

Thing is, usually with anxious thoughts you can talk yourself down, recognize on some conscious level that you are being irrational and that what you fear most won't come to fruition. In this case, that isn't at all true. In fact, what's irrational here is continuing to do what I do...there's a very high likelihood of getting caught and having my life fucked up even more than it already is just by using in the first place.

I remember reading an interview with the writer Denis Johnson where he talked about dabbling in heroin in his youth, but now he is grateful that he never had thick enough skin to really put himself in the situations required to seek it out for himself. I feel like I don't have that requisite grit either, but for some reason that doesn't stop me. Hasn't yet. 

I sometimes think that if I had a 'guardian angel' or benevolent force looking out for me and giving me protection, that poor bastard would be worn out and just about ready to throw in the towel.",1446716991.0

So...I've finally gotten to the point where I realize that I simply cannot do this on my own. I've tried outpatient detox followed by outpatient  therapy, but kept relapsing throughout that experience. I've tried doing my own cold turkey detoxes by locking myself at my parents house so I couldn't cop, but I always found s way to return to my apartment in the city earlier than planned so I could cop. I've tried tapering on my own with suboxone, but the desire to use just always compelled me to skip the subs and get back on H instead.

Throughout this process, my habit has grown to 3 buns/day and has drained the entire 40k I had in my bank account back in April when my relapse began, plus thousands in debt I've racked up. I also started shooting recently, which immediately became my preferred ROA, as I noticed I was going through a 10pack of needles every 2-3 days or so.

So at this juncture, I've decided that I need do inpatient rehab if I'm going to clean. It's either that or just continue on the path I was until it killed me, which while maybe appealing to me, I just couldn't do to family members who love me far more then I love myself.

So yeah, I didn't want you guys to think I died once I stop posting/commenting, as I'm being admitted into the facility tomorrow early-afternoon. I should actually be back online pretty soon because this rehab lets you keep your phone/laptop/etc on you after you get through the 5-day detox phase.

I've had some mediocre success with my experiments in IV use over the last few weeks. I gave up the ghost and tapered down a bit with s pretty strict chipping  regiment. 

Then I scored some VERY potent gear. I'm fairly certain this is a blend that contains a synthetic, possibly a fentanyl derivative. Again I know this is all very dangerous stuff but just trust that i am an uber cautious mega whimp and my dose game is low and  methodical.

I've been smoking this stuff but i would like to experiment with injection. My friend fixed me up IV the other day with the same stuff so I know what I can take. 

I've been unable to consistently get myself IV and though I normally wouldn't consider IM or SUB-C ROI, the potency and highly dilutable nature of this product means that I can put a strong but safe dose in 5 units (less even!) of a half CC rig.

So what say you? Do you think all of the above combined with my uber clean using practice (clean room, fresh rig every shot, disinfect all the  things, clean  person, latex  gloves, etc etc) means I can safely try a pop or IM shot? Is there anything I'm not  considering? Any tips?

The A 215s on the left in the photos are what I got recently.  The ones on the right are 100% known real.  First thing I noticed was the taste.  The ones I got are EXTREMELY bitter and left my tongue feeling weird after trying to consume one.  It's hard to explain but kind of like my tongue felt numb but not totally numb; no pins and needles.  The sizes also concern me.  Left is clearly larger then right.

The only other thing I noticed was with the inscription of the ""1"".  The ones on the left seem like just a straight line going up and down for the ""1"".  The ones on the right you can see the little slash on top of the ""1"".  This I'm not totally 100% sure about because my eyes could be fucking with me but it's what I noticed.

As far as effect, I don't usually need much to get where I want to be but I never really got a chance to feel anything after feeling a different taste.  I must add that I'm currently sick so my taste is way off but the real ones I have didn't feel like that and I'm too nervous to try and take the other ones again to see what they do.  Any ideas guys?


EDIT:  Wanted to add that color schemes seem kind of off.  Left seems a little more blue, right a tad whiter.  Few speckles on the back of both left and right.  Right doesn't crumble when pressure is applied but is kind of hard to snap in half regardless.",1446708424.0

He had a wife, two little girls and a family that loved and supported him even during his worst. Their lives will never be the same and they must live with the pain and suffering due to his choice of actions to pull that trigger.



I've been in a really dark places myself, especially in the height of my addiction and often considered just ending the pain and tapping out. Ultimately the pain and terrible impact it would have on my kids and family prevented me from ever going through with it.

I'll try to make this little tale brief.

I've been buying assorted pills from dude for around 3 years now.  I started buying from his wife initially, and she ended up turning me over to him.  From jump, it was pretty obvious that he was into me, but I just tried to stick with the business and ignore that.  Being a chick and such, it happens.  Over time he starts to come onto me.  Joking stuff at first, but then he tries to get me to start fucking him for pills or cash, which I refused to do. After he officially crossed the line we have had the most bizarre relationship.  

He always calls me love and sweetie.  Compliments galore.  Never fails to notice new clothes or shoes or nails or change in hair.  I've hung out with him on occasion. Riding around with him while he was selling to other people, we went and had drinks a few times, hung out with him and his brother and some of his friends a few times.  He essentially passed me off to his brother saying ""since I cant have you, I want him to"", and gave him my number.  He has begged me to go to hotels with him.  He's always telling cashiers and bartenders that I'm his wife.  He told me that he would love to let me meet his mom and that she would love me.  Today he told me if he had met me under different circumstances that he would have married me instead of his wife.  This dude has told me he loved me before. 

Every time he tries to cross my boundaries I always tell him no flat out, or basically that I'm just not into him.  It always goes back to that though.  He's into me, he'd take care of me, etc.  I honestly don't think he's a bad guy, I'm just not attracted to him.  Not to mention fucking for pills is not my style.  He's never been pushy or scared me or made me feel physically uncomfortable, and never gotten angry when I turned him down.  I suppose I was wrong for spending time with him and stuff, but I never led him on or fed into what he wanted.  I also fucked his brother and he was oddly supportive.

It's the most fucked up relationship I've ever had with any dealer.  

No matter what has transpired, he is a great connect though.  Always has what I want, will go out and find shit if he's out (without making any money), and is always available.  NO bullshit, or waiting, or saying he has something he doesn't, etc.  Fronted me tons of times and gave me free shit when I smiled acted cute. It's just feels really fucked up and probably very unhealthy that he and I have this...whatever the hell it is though.

Here's what I did today, it's not the most exciting day, but it worked out.

 My day started off working from 7-2 pm. Immediately after I got off work I had to go see my new PO, I knew this though so it wasn't like it was a surprise. 

Here's where the fun started for me. I walked like a mile from my PO's office to the bus station where I caught a bus going north. I then got off this bus and got onto the 'boonies' bus that takes you way north. I met my dude out here to pick up a fat .3 until I can pay him on Friday. From here, no buses go to my house, this is as close as they will get me. I start out on a 3.6 mile (or 1 hour, 13 mins according to google) walk home. I make it about 3 blocks and a about 50 year old lady pulls up at a redlight by where I was crossing and asks why I am walking. Well bitch, 'CUZ I DON'T HAVE A CAR!!!'

My favorite part is that it is actually sedating, unlike sub which makes my mind and heart race.  

Now why cant our country get it's shit together and make methadone just as available as sub and covered by medicaid in all states. This drug has worked for years for me but the cost is unreasonable.

Adding to that the fact that I'm likely to die in the next few years and the fact that I'm getting this stuff totally legally (and incredibly cheaply compared to street prices), and I'm left with no real reason not to do it, other than I suppose the constant fear of being cut off, the need to lie all the time, and the self-loathing.  

Unfortunately I'm stuck in a limbo where I can't picture a future for myself, I'm not nearly as invested in living as I was a few years ago, but I'm not close enough to dying that no one gives a shit and they'll just prescribe me whatever I ask without a second thought.  Puts me in the morbid position sometimes of hoping for something bad to happen sooner rather than later, just to get it over with so I can focus on enjoying the time I have left and not worry so much about being judged for taking too many pills or infinitely more importantly being cut off. 

For now I'm making an effort to cut back from the 100-120mg/day of oxycodone that feels comfortable, with the help of my oncologist's polite yet ominous reminders.  Why can't I have a corrupt doctor for once?  Where are they all?

Anyway I want to doff my cap to you veteran addicts, I have a new respect for the crushing hell that you go through because of the stuff, and my dependence is nothing compared to some of you guys and gals, I've never even had anything given IV outside of a hospital (one cool thing about that was that they give cancer patients an implant in the chest called a portacath to facilitate IVs, it sends the drugs to a huge vein right outside the heart, excellent delivery system for dilaudid, highly recommended). 

In my most recent withdrawals, I came to the conclusion that this experience was unequivocally worse than any chemotherapy or radiation I've ever had, and I've had a lot (watch someone who's had twice as much and shoots an ounce of H a day into their eyeball call me a pussy now.  they wouldn't be wrong). It could just be that the WDs are fresher in my memory.  However at least with chemo you're in a hospital or clinic being waited on hand and foot, you can request any drug, food, or other comfort you need.  WDs also gave me some of the worst anxiety I've ever felt, and made me feel deeply sad and alone.  

Obviously this won't be universally true, chemo can be awful beyond comprehension in some cases.  I just wanted to reaffirm what you already know-- that if anyone tries to minimize the unbelievable difficulty of quitting this stuff, they're absolutely and completely full of shit.   Thanks for reading my rambling, (the oxy makes me annoyingly talkative/typative sometimes) and thanks to this sub in general for being here when I have no one else to go to with this crap.  

TLDR; got cancer, told myself I wouldn't get addicted, got addicted, might die soon, trying to cut back anyway until I know for sure, but coming right back to it if/when I get the bad news, in the meantime thanks for the comradeship.",1446664183.0

However, I have always been an above-average sweater. If I get a little anxious, if a room is over 70ish degrees, if something gives me a hot flash (like tripping on the sidewalk triggering a rush of adrenaline) I immediately start sweating.

I know clonidine is often mentioned as being good for stopping sweats, but I don't think I can safely take that medication due to an unrelated condition.

So my question is, what is every possible medicine or trick to reduce overall sweating; both opiate-WD sweating and normal sweating? I know opiates have obviously made this worse and getting well helps, but I'm also just looking for any other tips to help with this nasty side effect. It's just really uncomfortable to walk around sweaty all day, and it always feels like there's no escape (especially when you start consciously worrying about it or try to slow it down mentally).

One thing that helps is going to the bathroom and just splashing face/neck/arms with cold water. But I would love to hear if people have other tips or solutions; drug-related OR some sort of ""mind over matter"" way to calm your body down. Could we get a list of sweating / cold sweats remedies going? I imagine other people might benefit from this too.

I really do enjoy nodding out. It takes me far far away from all my problems, fear Anxiety, hopeless, and emptiness. My thoughts of ne ver going anywhere is life, the disappointment I bring my family, the silent hatred I feel from my friends; the hate I have for myself, and the absolute loneliness wrapped in chains inside soul, locked with a lock that has no key.

But when I nod I become comfortable, happy, and relaxed. The world around me slowly slips away and I gp on these crazy adventures, where time and space and logic don't matter. Like for example I could  talk to an alien in a coffee shop about his day as we play chess. All While I see some of the most vivid colors I didn't know existed.
 Most things that happen in my out of mind nods are forgot the instant I come too for a second but then I go right back in and a whole new experience is given to me. 

When I'm really fucked up I start to lose the ability to tell what is real and what is a dream they all form together into this one big mess of visions. Like I can hear what's happening around me but see the wacky world in my head.

Basically what I'm trying to say in this rambling of a high as junkie is this.
The nod is my favorite world in existence,  it's where I want to be. I can be anything, go anywhere and Do anything in want. But I don't have control over it it's just my brain forming this crazy world of mayhem. Beautiful mayhem, but then you sober up a little bit and then it's gone.

Does the fact that I only took it for one day matter - will I be able to get high if I give it about 24 hours? I would hate to waste dope trying to break through the bupe. 

Sidenote: I haven't done subs in a while, and when I opened the bag and got a whiff of that orange scent I literally started dry heaving, let alone when it was in my mouth, I wanted to puke the entire time. Anyone else get this?

TL;DR:  Will I be able to feel dope after 24 hours if I only took sub for a single day? ",1446792008.0

3rpg9z,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3rpg9z/faqs_on_opiates/,8,https://redd.it/3rpg9z,keysoze,FAQs on Opiates,"What are Opiates?  
  
**Common Opiates**  
* Tramadol  
* Codeine  
* Morphine  
* Hydrocodone  
* Oxycodone  
* Hydromophone  
* Oxymorphone  
* Fentanyl  
* Heroin  
* Poppy Seeds  
  
**Bioavailibity and Route of Administration**  
Most opiates have a better bioavailability when administered through IV (Intravaneously). Some may consider IV usage as a *dirty* ROA (Route of Administration), but if you want the *most* out of your Opiate it is usually the best way to go. If you **DO NOT** want to IV, plugging is usually the next best option and if that is **ALSO TOO DIRTY** check out the bioavailibility link in the sidebar for an indepth rundown. Below is just a quick run through on the most agreed upon ROA's without IV or plugging.  
  
**Common ROA's for *Best* Results**  
* Tramadol - Oral  
* Codeine - Oral  
* Morphine - Oral  
* Hydrocodone - Oral  
* Oxycodone - Oral  
* Hydromophone - Intranasal  
* Oxymorphone - Intranasal  
* Fentanyl - Transdermal  
* Heroin - Smoked/Intranasal  
* Poppy Seeds - Oral  
  
**Dosage and Overdose**  
When dealing with opiates and dosing, one should always think **YOU COULD NEVER TAKE LESS, BUT CAN ALWAYS TAKE MORE**. Harm reduction is key when dealing with *ANY* drug because for one you are already harming your body by taking these drugs. APAP (acetaminophin/tylenol) is commonly used in conjuction with Codeine, Hydrocodone, and Oxycodone and can cause serious liver damage. If taking large quantities, beware of your APAP intake or do a CWE (Cold Water Extraction) which can be found in the sidebar.  
A common question asked for beginners is the dose amount needed to ""feel *high*"" and here is my personal *opinion* on some common opiates.  
* Morphine - 30mg  
* Hydrocodone (Norco/Vicodin) - 30mg  
* Oxycodone (Percocet, RoxiCodone) - 15-20mg  
* Hydromorphone (Dilaudid) - 2-3mg intranasal  
  
**Drug Tests and Pupils**  
Nearly all opiates will stay in your system for **3 days** after the last use. Although this stat is generally agreed upon, take into consideration that the many variables from person to person.  
When a person uses opiates his/her eyes will be pinned. If one is paranoid about their eyes being pinned there are eyedrops such as Opcon-A allergy eye drops that may help with dilating the pupils. The effectiveness of Opcon varies from person to person, but generally produces great results.
  
**Tolerance, Addiction, and Withdrawal**  
Tolerance build up will occur in the case of most drugs. It varies from person to person which makes it a very difficult topic to put a statistic on.  
  
When does a person become addicted and how does one know? A person who is addicted to opiates whether mentally or physically needs the drug to feel normal. Feelings such as cravings for the drug is a good sign of addiction. The time frame of usage before one becomes addicted is another topic in which stats are difficult to prove or disprove. From personal experience, I found myself addicted after only 2 weeks of everyday usage.  
  
Withdrawal (WDs) usually occur approximately 12 hours after the last dose and has flu like symptoms. The most common symptoms of opiate withdrawal is: pain, diarrhea, allergies, dry heaving, hot and cold sweats, anxiety, restless leg syndrome, and insomnia. Withdrawal usually last for 3-4 days with the worst symptoms on the 2nd and 3rd day (again, it varies per user). Drugs such as Suboxone may induce withdrawal (Precipitated Withdrawal) as it *usually* has a stronger affinity when attaching to opiate receptors flushing out the previous opiate.  
To ease and combat withdrawal, many users use a combination of OTC (over the counter) meds, prescription only meds, natural remedies, and techniques. Some examples are: Loperamide, Kratom, Neurotin (Gabapentin), Benzodiazepines, Marijuana, and much more. For a more in-depth guide to withdrawal, check the sidebar link.

3row8b,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3row8b/done_being_the_nice_guy/,40,https://redd.it/3row8b,PercoThrowaway,"Done being the ""nice guy""....","Preface : no sourcing, don't ask anyone in here (including me) for shit/how to get shit. sorry for the long post.

Now, i'm not the nicest guy ever. I'm not Mr. Rogers. But I am very personable, fairly polite, I text back within a reasonable amount of time, etc. Lots of common deceny shit that most people in the opi game seem to be missing. I am too trusting and too agreeable, but that's my problems.

So for a couple months now i've been helping some people find stuff when they were either getting middleman'd hard, had a super shit connect, had no connect, etc. I've been in all of those spots before, it sucks bad. 

Basically, how it works is,  I get a half for not being a dick and middlemanning, and the phone number/guy is yours. First time I go with you to meet em then I'm no longer involved. Most people are more than fine with that since, well, it's a steal when I could make far more $ off of em. Anyway, 75% of the time people have enough $ at the time to get me my half and get themselves whatever. We go, then they drop me off and it's all "" okay great you're cool lets kick it sometime ok drive home safe thanks "". About 25% of the time, they only have X amount of money or have to get X amount of stuff, so they can't give me my half then and there. Understandable, i've been there too. Usually, in this case, i'm cool with it as long as I have $ to pick up for myself (& they're basically giving me the ride for free) and they toss me at least 0.1-0.2, under the stipulation that they get me my full 0.5 sometime soon. Doesn't have to be tomorow, or even 5 days from now, but sometime soon. Most of the time I get my half G within a week.

So stuff is going great, make lots of friends. A few are just one and dones, a few I hang out with once every two weeks or so. Except for the very first guy I helped out.

Basically, he only has enough for a G or some bullshit, but it has to last both him and his girlfriend 4 days or some shit. So i'm like alright whatever, I have cash so I can get my own shit, plus he'll toss me a dime (0.1) tonight. I make sure he knows 100% that part of the deal is, he gives me 0.5g within a decent amount of time, for the connect he is getting. He is more than fine with it, and when I texted him about it after he dropped me off later that night, his exact text was "" y3ah as soon as i have money ill figure something out for you for sure, thanks for helping us out once again"". I say ""No problem, thanks"" and he says ""cool i'll let you know when I do that"".

Don't hear from him, I hit him up like three weeks later about something different but was checking up on when I was gonna get my half, no answer to a text/phone call. 

At this point I kinda forget about it, I wasn't super desperate for it or anything and it's been like 3 - 4 months or so. I haven't seen him, I figure that hes quit or some shit. I kinda just don't think about em at all.

So, yesterday afternoon i'm going to pick up at my guys work for the first time. I walk down, meet him, all good, walk back and guess who I see? This asshole and his girlfriend in their ugly red SUV. At the time, I didn't know it was them, so I just looked for a sec and kept walking. It still hadn't clicked with me that he owed me the half still, until I got in the car, called him and asked if it was him, talked for 5 seconds then hung up.

 Then, as I was halfway home, I was going through our texts and I realized this fucker never paid me my half! I ask my guy about him(plug and I are homies) and he says he comes and cops every once in a while. Not super often but not once a month either. I know for a fact that guy-who-owes-me-half has at least one other connect so he prob just used my guy as backup and has been using normally. So this fucker 100% has had money to get me the half he owes me without him being short on bills/rent/black for him and his girlfriend. He could of easily set aside $5 each time he copped or every other time he copped and gotten the half G to me within a month!

So I text the asshole ( **name redacted sorry mods lol** is his name on here iirc no idea if he is active or not still ) ""I guess i'm never getting my half, huh?""....20 minutes later I get back ""I might be able to figure something out i'll let you knoe"".  Yeah, sure, I believe that. Now it's making sense that when I saw him in the parking lot earlier that he noticed me immediately and had a scared look on his face.

So then I text him ""well it's been over three months dawg..."", no response. Then I send him a long text, basically saying that a half G isn't shit to ask for when giving someone a connect, it's been mad long, I already did my part, you lied to me, I said I could of been an asshole and just middlemaned the shit out of you but I didn't cause I assumed you would be honest about the half, etc etc.

Texted him today, still haven't heard from him. This is just one bad experience, i've had like 3 or 4 out of probably 15 total. The good ones are great, don't get me wrong. But it is frustraighting as shit when you're ""Mr. Nice Guy"", ALWAYS willing to help out(with more than just this shit) at a moments notice, but people take advantage of that kindness. Without going into another person-example, most of the time if I need some help with something opi/drug related everyones phone is dead/their at work/out of town, but as soon as they hit me up I text back within 10 minutes.

Wow. I posted this the other day, but reposting the story for those that didn't see. I've been going to this guy for a bit now. Stamps (unmarked) are pretty good. Anyway. I picked up 2 buns about a week ago. Once I was through the first one and started on the second one I immediately realized something was different. The stuff had a very very faint orange tint to it and was a bit more powdery. I didn't think much of it just figured it was cut with something.

Anyway, I only snort H and my tolerance is fairly big right now, but after doing a line I knew something was just wrong.

I was dizzy as fuck. I literally could not keep my eyes open to save my life & I got nausea. It was a MUCH different high than what I was used to, and remember, this is only from snorting. Anyway, I texted my dealer and let him know. I also texted a friend immediately who uses the same source. He told me he passed the hell out from it. His sister had to call work for him to tell them that he couldn't make it. He only snorts as well.

So, I just got more from the source, opened it up and compared it side by side to the possible fent and OMG. The fent is WAY dif. It is kind of amazing when you don't see it side by side you don't realize how different it is. It has a DEF orange tint.",1446758681.0

That's not to say I have no tolerance - I've chipped for years with pills, namely Opana. Opana to me is the perfect drug; absolute bliss with little side-effects, so when I couldn't find any good DNM vendors with it, I decided to try dope. 

I ordered some grey #4 from a reputable vendor, and got it yesterday. Has a faint vinegar smell, very hard little pebbles, and light to dark grey, which I know are indicators of it being decent, along with glowing customer reviews. Basically this shit didn't give me much euphoria, but made me nod out for most of the night. Also I became SUPER FUCKING ITCHY. I'm not opiate naive, and I've had some bad itches, the worst being from PST, but this was on a different level. I was at the mercy of this itch for the next 8 hours. It felt like my skin was crawling with fleas and bugs; it was an itch that wouldn't let me leave it alone. I actually had to run in the bathroom, pull my pants down and itch madly all along my legs, since I was around people all night I didn't want to know I was high. 

After I dosed, I took 50 mg. DPH for this express reason, but it seemed to do nothing. All in all, this really ruined most of the fun for me, and this dope has nothing on Opana in my opinion. Is this normal for sniffing dope? Anything besides DPH that will help?

He's currently on probation and got on butyr-fentanyl since it typically won't trip a drug test. 


He started out snorting about 100mg in 48 hours and has since moved on to vaping it. He vapes around 500 mg in 48 hours now. I was on it for a brief period as well, but would maybe only do about 100 mg in 48 hours. I was able to get off with just about 1mg of subutex, and I've been about 4 days clean, though I still feel minor WD symptoms like back pain and severe depression. 


We only have about 3mg left of the subutex for him (after a few other failed attempts of trying to quit this shit). He has a prescription for gavapentin which has helped us with WD symptoms in the past but we're not sure when or if we'll be able to get his prescription refilled. He also mentioned a vitamin you can buy at the vitamin shop (can't remember the name right now) which in high doses can mimic the effects of gavapentin which we'll probably be picking up on today. Other than that as of right now we don't have anything. He still has a little of the butyr-f left for today but by tonight he'll be out. There's no way we can get more for him to wean off. We could get tar though, and have considered buying some for him to monkey water to bring his tolerance down, since his next drug test isn't for another week or so. 


We're concerned that since butyr-f is a research chemical that the WDs will last longer than typical fentanyl WD. His friend who is also addicted to a large amount of this stuff had tried to quit by taking 8mg suboxone strips every day for 4 days and he said it didn't really help. 


Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Also as a side note, we tried Kava and had a bad experience with it. He got really sick on it, but we also weren't sure exactly how much he should have taken. I'm not sure he'd be willing to try again though.

Anyway, I picked up with my fiancée right before work was over (work in IT, ok to leave my desk whenever) and smoked it up pretty quick (loyal to the foil) so we gathered some more funds and picked up again, so we're good until tomorrow afternoon at least. Now I've got a friend looking for Colombian marching powder and is willing to front me $40 towards a G of my own, so here we go! I recently discovered how to make hard after the girl got $800 or so worth of yayo fronted earlier in the year.

It's going to be a good night, we're kinda lit from the BTH and stoked on putting some rocks on the foil (not much luck with a stem + chore, melts right through) and having ourselves a little party. Anyone else got a decent cocktail going or in the works for tonight? Be careful out there fam, and come say hello to the IRC community some time, link in the sidebar to the right. I'd like to remind everyone that just like this sub, there's absolutely no sourcing on IRC. Don't ask if there is anyone in X city/area, we've seen it all and have no problem removing the troublemakers.

I explained to my boss (who was surprisingly understanding) that I've been having issues for like ten years as far as randomly falling asleep. It hasn't really reached it's zenith, however, since I started my regular use of opiates. Leaving out the drug parts obviously, I explained how I frequently dose off at the wheel (even once on route 287, if anyone's familiar with how dangerous that highway can be, esp. around exit 14 at rush hour **<-** ***not near where I live btw so not sourcing here***), l almost got fired the first day of my last job by falling asleep during training (it was a tech-support job, and ""training"" consisted of watching a co-worker answer calls for 9 hours), and used to do push-ups in the bathroom to stay awake at the job I had before *that* one, which involved customer service. Essentially, I randomly fall asleep anywhere that I'm forced to sit down for awhile, but am never tired if I'm moving around (like when I was a substitute teacher). My folks now want to have me see a doctor to see if I should be prescribed adderall, but this will of course require blood work. I need to make sure that my system is free of opiates because I'm not tryna lose whatever jobs I have in the future, and more importantly I need to make sure I don't crash my car and die one day. This has become the first time in my life where I've determined that if I don't stop my opiate use, it may easily lead to my early demise. I really want to live, even if it's not as fun. Who knows, maybe it's not opiate related after all and I'll end up with an adderall script! Detox begins Monday morning (I've got subs and etiz so I should be good), so wish me luck people. I feel like I've got a lot to offer this world (currently in school to hopefully teach high school in two-three years), so here's to hoping I can live long enough to change some lives.

As always, I'm hesitant to ask suboxone-related questions here given the endless threads already answered, but this is more PWD-specific:

Anyone who has seen my post history has seen me constantly rave about suboxone. I am currently using it for maintenance (and every once in a while I take a bit extra for a great long-lasting buzz), but every once in a while I take a break and partake in some of the more fun opiates. Despite the fact that almost everyone says the rule of thumb is to wait 24ish hours (or more if using methadone or something w/ longer half life) before switching back to subs to prevent PWDs, I have never had to wait more than 8-12 hours- probably because my tolerance is fairly low. But I am always scared that ""cheating"" like this and being impatient will inevitably bite me in the ass and throw me into PWDs.

So my question is, for those of you who HAVE experienced PWDs, how long did it take for the PWD symptoms to hit you from the time of sub induction? Even though I'm lucky enough to never have experienced it, it's always scary to switch back to subs. 

When I do take the subs, there is that scary waiting period where I am waiting to see whether I start feeling better or I start sweating/shitting/puking all over the place. So I was just wondering if there is also a rule of thumb or predictable timeline for when PWDs would kick in (if they're going to). Obviously it depends on a lot of factors, but can you tell like 2 minutes later whether the subs will make you feel better or MUCH worse? Or does it take an hour or two for the subs to start taking full effect?

I have found that, in addition to my small tolerance, starting with a very small amount of subs in this situation is a good way to ""test the waters"", then depending on how I'm feeling about 30ish mins later I will up the dose until I'm where I want to be. This seems like a logical way to be careful about preventing PWDs, but I don't even know if that truly works since I don't have any incidents of PWD to compare with. So, for those of you who have experienced PWDs or are more knowledgable than me on this subject, how long after taking your subs do you start to feel shitty? And is the intensity very directly related to the dose of subs? In other words, is my method of starting with ~1mg to test the waters actually valid, or is it just that my body/receptors are prepared for a suboxone dose?

Thanks in advance for any experiences or facts you can share! Of course this will depend on a lot of factors and vary from person to person, so I am interested in seeing what you all have to say.

TLDR; When you switch back to suboxone from traditional opiates, how long approximately does it take to tell whether you'll be fine or you're doomed to PWDs? And are the chances of PWD directly related to dosage size of the subs?",1446991001.0

Well the title pretty much sums it up! After being sick all morning, evening, and night I had not 1, not 2, but 3 strokes of luck throughout my eventful day.

1st stroke of luck would be the fact that I woke up broke and sick (as per every day) and pop dukes asked if I wanted to hit the casino with him (he has a gambling problem). He threw me 20 bucks and I ended up walking out with 180 (giving him 80 because he lost BIG and I felt bad)

2nd stroke of luck - My dude was supposed to spend the night at his girls house, and my other dude didnt answer his phone, and my usual dude hit me up at 2:30 A.M saying he ended up going home after gettin his nut (LOL).He told me I could stop by if I wanted to! So fuck yeah, I wont be sick and Ill be able to sleep!

3rd stroke of luck - I get pulled over at around 2:40 A.M on my way to cop. I wasn't nervous as I had nothing on me (or so I thought...) So I played it off extra cool and even offered the cop permission to search the vehicle without him even asking. He ends up letting me go and apologizing for pulling me over as he initially thought I was a repeat offender drunk driving because its 3 am on a saturday night (ran my plates and saw that I had a DUI a few years back, is this even a valid excuse to pull someone over? Because of their criminal history?) I ended up having an empty bag with residue and a straw in my jacket pocket that I had no idea about until I got to my dudes house.

TL;DR - Turn 20 dollars into 180, cop dope at 3 am after anticipating being sick and not sleeping, still have money for a bag for tomorrow!

On the 0 dose days I've obviously felt mentally shit (not as bad as day 1 of kicking dope), physically only fatigued and nasty (again not as bad). I attribute this to the long half-life of sub. What I'm wondering is when my time starts ticking towards my w/d's as a result of its half-life. Not knowing whether today for example counts makes it mentally difficult (and a trigger) since with dope at least you know. As I'm sure you can understand it makes me want to switch back for a day in order to know when my clock starts. The fear of undoing my ""progress"" so far certainly makes me apprehensive.

That being said, when it comes to the whole class of benzodiazepines it seems like they honestly do nothing to me. Yes, huge doses of Xanax will make my blackout - I'm not saying that. What I am saying is that when it comes to abuse-potential, to me, at least, it seems benzos have about as much liability as diphenhydramine.

I've felt sleepy after taking them, but I've never felt any special mood-lift, much less euphoria. There's no relaxation to talk about. It seems like the only thing benzos do to me is make me black-out or make me nod harder from an already especially high  dose of IV opiates.

Am I missing something here? I'm not expecting anything earth-shattering, but in the past decade I've used and abused Xanax, Ativan, Valium, Temazepam, and Klonopin and I can honestly say that 99.9% of me sees no point in trying to get high from these drugs.

I don't do it, but fuck it i'm down to try a lil piece with some BTH and i'm always down to help a friend in need so I say text me. We text. He picks me up within an hour of first text, its like 1am-ish. We go get black from my guy, its raw. Im happy. We then go to another spot to pick up da crack. Oops, we need to break a 100 bill. Stop at Chevron 0.05 seconds from the crack guys apartment. Chevron says ""fuck yo 100 fuccboi ass hoefuck"". Go to hoodmart across the street. Bingo, we got change. Pull out onto the street, our turn to pick up crack is the next left, about 5 seconds away(basically, to go to where we needed to park to get the crack, we had to take a left out of the hoodmart parking lot, drive for 5 seconds, take another left, then halfway down the street pull into a short drive that leads around back of apartments. Instead of doing that with the cop behind us, we kept driving and made a left, looping around to the main road where we could of made a right and another quick right to get to originally, this is basically why he pulled us over I think besides the whole ""2 white boys in the hood at 230am"")

We basically do a loop because what are we gonna do, pull behind the crack dealers fucking apartment? Tbh we should of, would of been waaaay less suspicious. Anyhoo, we basically did a circle, cop turns on lights and pulls us over. EDIT IDK how but I forgot to add this part in, this was half the reason I made the post, thank you b/r/opiate[2] for reminding me! For the first time in my life, I shove something in my ass intentionally. I never ever eeevverr get pulled over, so most of the time I keep my shit stashed enough that I could swallow it or put it in my flesh trunk if needed, but I never had to. Also, I wanted to note that I pulled it out when I got to my house and smelled it(idfk why) and it legit made me puke. I gagged 3-4 times and then puked out front of my house. Light puke, but still puke. It smelled like death, the most vile rancid disgusting...it didn't even smell like shit. When I pulled it out the inch or so of spare plastic on the other side of the knot/where the black was in the plastic was sticking out of my asshole, so I just pulled that out and I felt a lil ""pop!"". I now know what having an extremely small anal bead in your ass unlubed feels like. Idk maybe next time if a girl sticks her finger in there while blowing me I wont (accidently) jerk forward crazy hard and give her a bloody nose...sadly that didn't happen tonight.

NICE SAVE /u/PERCOTHROWAWAY [3] NICE FUCKIN SAVE). Were in the clear. Asshole(nah not really he was pretty chill, younger dude, answered a question I had about my license). Sadly, no crack tonight. I was 2spooped and basically the guy who was middlemanning the crack deal by phone called it off. Whatever, were coppin tomorrow. FUGG IT. Just got home, shot up .2, feeling good. High not lasting very long because of my sub earlier but whatever I have a point and a strong 70ml shot left for tomorrow AM, then I should be getting a fair amount of black tomorrow for some subs.

Drank that with some OJ. After a half hour I was sweating, and my stomach ached (think it was because of the lemon on an empty stomach). After an hour and a half- yup, fucked up. I felt fantastic and was up until 430 am. Woke up the next morning, and still was feeling it. 

Did a re-wash....nothing. 

Tried making more yesterday with more seeds, but different brand. Nothing. And these seeds looked less clean than the first ones I used. I'm attempting a re-wash today.

First off this isn't the only subreddit  posting this to
Second, little experience, no tolerance to opiates,
Heres the story, within a 3 hour period tonight I've 10pm-1am ive consumed 7, 7.5/325mg Norco Hydrocodones (2nd time ever taken them, the first time i did them was the night before this night, so yesterday). At 1am, (tonight), i took 40mg of Vistaril (to make the opiate more potent) and with the Visaril,
 i had a two to three cups of coffee, and my 5th, 6th, amd 7th hydro. 
The night before i had 3 7.5's, i never got all the euphoria but i felt loose and good, chained smoked cigs and had my eyes closed basically the whole time kind of hallucinating. So thats my 'high' on hydrocodone.
Tonight at 10pm i took 3 and 20 minutes later took another, i felt nothing basically at all, nodded off a couple times but ehh, and then i added the rest of the drugs at 1am and now its 4 am  and scared to go to sleep over what happened.
So what happened? At around, 3:15 a.m. been laying down on my bed for a little bit turned off my t.v. to finish my final nods and fall asleep. Well I'm not a religious person at all really and i dont regularly pray at all but for some reason, i did, incase something happened and i took to much(for my 2nd time) and stop  breathing over night or something. So i turned off my TV and decided to go to sleep, then i had these really weird wavy sound hallucinations they were to loud  to ignore. (no  REAL sounds in my room by the way) then I turned on Pulp Fiction to ignore it, then i got my phone and started to google if you can have sound hallucinations from hydrocodone, then it happened.. I locked up couldnt move at all. The audio from the first intro song from pulp fiction sounded really wavy and distorted my vision was distorted i couldnt move my eyes really at all, and i noticed i wasnt breathing, i couldnt open my mouth to get bigger breaths so i forced my breathing and it was hard to do so, i couldnt scream for my mom, i thought i was about to die. My whole body felt as if it was vibrating like a phone, literally like a cell phone, it wasnt shaking my body was vibrating, and there was a constant knock in the back of my head where your bottom back of my skull turns into my neck. I thought i was going to die, i could barely breathe, and its like i can barely remember it. This also happened earlier today when i tried to nap but it was only for a second, this literaly like 1 to 2 minutes, ive never had sleep paralysis and dont know much abouf it.
Was i ODing? Can Hydrocodone cause sleep paralysis when used recreationaly? Could I have almost died? Im scared to try to sleep, it was that scary and im fucking terrified. Sorry for the long post I need someones knowledge.",1447062447.0

When I first was looking for a sub doctor it was so weird. The first had this really unprofessional person answering the phone and set my appointment up...like she couldn't sound trashier. Three days before my appointment he got raided and arrested by some DEA/locals task force busting him for writing scripts to girls for sex and guys to sell and give him money for, and who knows what else...when I heard that at the time I wished I went to him sooner lol.

Second sub doctor had nothing but an answering machine that said leave a message if you need a refill and someone will get back to you. Seriously nothing other than that and could not get an appointment or ever get a person after weeks of trying to call. The third that I tried sounded shady on the phone and was charging like 350 for induction and 200 an appointment after that (every two weeks max) - no insurance, cash only.

I think that iv been using this place of endless of positivity to illicit reactions because in real life i feel like No one notices or appreciates me.  I feel like they cant see through my controversial exterior and my emotional defenses just like how Louis Lane couldn't see through Clark Kent's disguise to see the SuperMan that was hidden underneath all along.

I'm sorry /u/southern_phsychonaught for harassing you so intensely.  I guess seeing such a proud strong unrepentant gay guy with an obvious huge dick just really set off a lot of feelings that iv been running from for a long time.  I am the adopted son of two gay men and they are great.  I'll they have ever wanted for me to be was myself but for some reason coming out of the closet has been a real issue for me still.  it's like I don't wanna be gay because I want to rebel against them and their perfectly acceptable lifestyle.  Deep down I know if I embraced my sexuality I would be the poofiest poof in the world.  My dad's just keep telling me ""Do what makes you happy son!""

I'm sure there are other things that you could do this for but I'll leave that to your imagination.

First things first, be completely honest about how it happened *except* for one thing. Instead of telling them you injected dope, say it was cocaine. Why? Because you won't be able to get any painkillers for it if you do. Also being honest about everything else is important too because its necessary to receive the best treatment.

Secondly if the doc tries to prescribe you codeine, mention that you've had it before and that it resulted in an allergic reaction. I used this trick and he upgraded the scrip from tylenol-3s  to dilaudid. :D Also I know everyone on here is very knowledgeable about opis, but in this situation you've gotta suppress it and act like you don't know anything.

That's all for now, hope this helps!

being homeless, working my hustle and living outta my car in the new england winter was my rock bottom... i justified everything i could to tell myself that my addiction isnt that bad... i mean i was kicked outta my house, but still going to school and rocking  A's and B's in college, so i must be doing something fuckin rite???

nooo i was just bullshitting myself.. i looked like hell felt like shit until i was high, and was in such a crazy fucked up underground street life world that i had no idea how to get out...

ive always lived in the suburbs, but 3 cities surrounded my town.. and the temptation was a 15 minute drive to lace up and boot my diesel... 

anyways, ive been clean off dope for 10 months, (yes im on subutex maintaince) not suboxone.. but im actually 7months clean of hard (crack cocaine)... i went to many rehabs, psychwards, and institutions and finally i got the help that i needed...

i used drugs for various reasons, ""to feel great about myself/ well being/ confidence"" boredom, to fall asleep in a freezing car in the middle of winter, but most importantly to escape my PTSD...

i was molested as a child (at 8 years old) raped and beaten by my neighbor and i hid it from my parents for over 15 years until i told my mother when i was 23. im 25 years old now, and life is just amazingly more clear while being clean.. I have so much knowledge of myself and i am very perceptive towards myself and others.

its a tough grueling long ass fucking process to get clean... however , i realize all the pain and selfishness ive put my loved ones thru... eventhough 6months clean isnt very long, we all tie the record , and that is 24 hours.... if you can get thru 24 hours , then do it again.. 


 I go to NA meeting at least 2-3 times a week, see a drug therapist 2x a week, and have a psychiatrist i see once a month.. FIND A REASON IF DRUGS ARE FUCKING UP YOUR LIFE!

I'm not a regular to this subreddit. But of course this was my go-to after reading all these studies coming out about middle-aged white men dying at record rates, in no small part due to prescription painkiller overdoses. 

Is there anyone here that fits that description? If so, I really want to know how you started—and what kept you going. 

This question comes from two places: one, I've dabbled in painkillers. More than dabbled, really. I've lied to doctors to get some, though I don't use regularly. My dad uses painkillers recreationally, too (though he doesn't know i know). And so I can't help but see myself or those close to me in some of those reports. That's scary. But the other place this comes from is a journalistic perspective. I do work in news, but just to be clear, I don't want to seem like I'm only posting this for work. I don't know how I can come off as convincing on that note, but truly, I want to know the answer to the question I posted above.

 It's literally made me fiend for percs after 3 months, but having no connections for opiates I've not done any. 

Now a friend happened to have 8 perc 5's left over which I bought. Ended up taking 3, feeling pretty much nothing compared to what i felt before. Feeling exceedingly frustrated, I ended up taking the other 5 over the course of an hour. All in all I took 8 over the course of an hour and a half. 

I felt almost nothing. Other than getting itchy all over, there was no sense of the incredible warmness and euphoria I had felt from 3  months before. What gives? I had been looking forward to this forever.

I did eat a bag of spicy potato chips and drink a beer during, but could this have had such an effect? I also have a solid benzo tolerance but I know they act on different receptors...

I am wondering could you answer a question, shed some light on this if you could i have nobody else to ask, and the doctor does not help at all.

I know a opioid morphine/gabapentin patient and the doctor says the pains are from opioid use, and is taking all the opioids away bit by bit.

This person is panicking, and really is in pain, has a prolapse too but the doc insists the pain is from the opioids, they scanned the patient and found nothing, various tests found nothing wrong either, is it possible to get pains so badly from opioid withdrawals?

I am at a loss, completly. I am not sure what to do, should i buy the oxycontin for the patient? Or is it likely it is the cause and i am making things worse? I would like some opinions on it please.

Patient is currently using 30mg morphine sulphate 3 times a day, with emergency med for breakthrough pain at 20mgs per dose of fast acting morphine tablets. 

The patient also was on a much more higher dose at one point, 3 or 4 times higher than they are now, and ever since the opioids have been decreased the patient got worse, in bed all the time and complaining of back pains mostly, and honestly i believe they have sciatica too.

Thanks guys if you know anything about this.",1447110845.0

Okay so after my post (can't leave link doing on phone idk how too) titled ""Did I OD? did i almost die? No tolerance or experience with opiates"" I stayed up for another hour hallucinating, no euphoria, just scary ass tripping, then went to sleep for 5-15 minutes and had to get ready to go to high school.. I know, dumbass right? I taken 7, 7.5/325 Norco Hydrocodones with 40mg of Vistaril to make it more potent within 4 hours (initial dose was 4 hydro's then two hours later 3 more and 40mgs of vistaril) this last dose was around 1-2 a.m. 

So what happened, since I'm sober and can explain w/o freaking out? I tripped my balls off (even though they're opiates that's the best way I can explain the high I had), sat in my recliner, smoked a WHOLE pack of Marlboros within 5-6 hours just one after another, watched 'A Clockwork Orange' 3 times with my eyes shut the whole time seeing stuff and just fucking tripping and seeing shit with my eyes closed (I didn't black out or anything and didn't leave my room) about 3:45 in the A.m. I decided I'm still tripping but I'm going to go to bed. That's where all the fun happened, I layed down, turned off my Tv, and there was complete silence all through the house, but no, I was audio hallucinating hard. Fucking. Core. So bad that I was hearing screaming, talking, voices,music and I've never heard anything like it in my life. So I turned on Pulp Fiction, you know that first song that first song with the fast guitar? Yeah that fucked me up. I started to Google 'can you audio hallucinate on hydro' and I obviously knew the answer but I wanted to read what people said, then that song came on and I went into sleep paralysis and respitory depression just like that, next second I'm staring at my phone can't move an inch at all listening to how crazy that song sound with me hallucinating and the pitch just going up and down. Then about 15 seconds in this paralysis I was able to come up with the thought in my head, that I wasn't breathing at all. I tried with all my force to expand my lungs and I couldn't open my mouth it felt as if your nostrils was completely filled with snot and you had to breathe through your mouth but you can't open it what so ever, I tried screaming for my mom but I couldn't even open my mouth, I stayed calm and breathed in as hard as I could it was so hard to take just the smallest bit of air through my nose even though it was all clear (as in no snot, etc.) But I fought it and got through it, paralysis last honestly up to 5 minutes, then I jolted up and noticed my heart is COMPLETELY out of rythym, skipping beats, and not steady pressure either, thats when I made my initial post freaking out. I was so scared to go to sleep I didn't get to sleep until around 5:30 ish and got up in 15 minutes later to get ready for school, I was traumatized the whole school day and I told my friends what happened, I'm a dumbass for doing that much with out tolerance, for now I'm just going to stick with my xannies and adderall, stay safe everyone! Cheers.

By the way, was the high worth it? I dont know, it was one hell of an experience. Do I know the dangers of ApAp and think I took to much? or feel pain in my liver? No, I might be in highschool, but I did enough research that the first 4 I took I did a Cold Water Extraction. Thank you for the feedback on my last post and seriously be safe!",1447109811.0

Over one thousand miles away from home. I have been here 2 months now, ever since I got out of rehab. Today marks the 150th day since I put dope or meth in my veins.

Going to rehab this time was the easy part. I lost everything I cared about. Buried my dad from a long battle with cancer a little over a year ago. One month before I went to treatment I caught the absolute love of my life sleeping with my best friend, well he was more like my brother. My life was a vicious cycle of working and using. I couldn't envision life further than the next cop. A good job, wife, family, happiness? As foreign concept to me as quantum physics. 

Treatment honestly was the best thing to ever happen to me. For the first time I have a fucking amazing therapist, I made some amazing friendships, and was genuinely happy. I spent 3 months in pine grove before I was ready for the next part of my journey. I knew I couldn't go back to my home town without using or selling again. That life was all that I had there. So I left and went to the state I always wanted to live in, Colorado.

The first 2 weeks were great. Driving in the mountains, hanging with girls for the first time in months, and enjoying life. I was on that pink cloud 9. Then it busted. I felt alone. See, life didn't change. Life was just as shitty as it always was. All that changed was that I couldn't get fucked up to deal with it. In the past I would of picked up and said fuck it. But this time, I didnt. I could have easily. Denver has cheap tar everywhere, and in sober living the drug tests are far apart. I could have gotten high, gotten away with it and no one would be the wiser. Hell, the old me used to just do shit just solely because I could get away with it.

But here I am. Hardly any money to my name. Starting a part time job at best buy this week. Still have no real friends. Still feeling like life is pretty damn shitty. But guess what? I'm not high. I'm not sick. I'm not planning some con. Not nervous waiting on hundreds of grams of mdma in the mail to sale. I'm not fucking high. I dealt with so much shit. And I'm not fucking high. I will deal with a lot of shit in the future. Will I be high? Who the fuck knows. But today, that isn't an option.

 I don't even care about the money at this point, it's the fucking principle, but you can't ask for much of that whenever it comes to this shit. I should've known better when he asked for the money before flashing the product. Seriously fucking stupid on my part. 

We had gotten somewhat close after his girl dumped him and I tried to be a ""friend"" and help him get through it. I thought about planning some sort of revenge but it's not even worth it for the money...or the jail time...or getting shot...or stabbed. You live and you learn I guess.

Texted him and told him that I hoped he needed the money more than me.

I was left with a blob of jello and a small amount of cola that tasted like medicine. 

I drank the cola and chewed and swallowed the blob. I figured since I didn't grind it up etc. it wouldn't work, but here I am feeling extremely good. 

Could it be placebo? I doubt it cause I have a high tolerance, but why does the cola method work? I understand it does because the acid in the sioda acta like stomach acid, but what exactly was the blob that was left over? ",1447086235.0

I don't usually post, but my morning has been so abysmally shitty, I had to share. First, I woke up sick. Nothing new there. I go to my room to cook some cottons and the single bag I had saved for this morning. Should've added up to maybe a three bag shot, decent by anyone's standards. I'm doing my thing, finish wringin out my cottons, add a little water, go to add my bag. The resulting cocktail is in my spoon, sitting on my lap. Of course, I'm shaking so bad, when I go to pick it up to cook it, I spill all, literally all of it, on my pants. Nothing could be done, except cry a little. I brush this off, thinking, 'well, I have twenty dollars, Ill go cop.' Get in the car, start hauling ass to my guys place. This is where I made my second fatal mistake. The money is on the middle council, and I decide to open my window for a cig. Now, its a windy morning, but nothing crazy. I roll down both front windows about half way, and, I'm not kidding, my twenty gets sucked out the passenger side window, into the great beyond. Nothing like this has ever happened to me in my entire fucking life. I go to get out and look, but its looooong gone. So I limp home, burning the shit out of myself and breaking my last cigarette on the way, to find I'm locked out. I call my mother, and she tells me shell be home soon, and, that she can lend me twenty. Currently waiting on my back porch. I can only imagine where my day is gonna go from here. Thanks for lookin out, JJ.",1447256768.0

So about 3 hours go by its now 7 am and I decide to take a peak at my frisbee snorting setup I had hidden under one of my drawers. I scraped up so much fucking powder off that disk, there was also a ten dollar bill rolled up that I had kept in there as well, and a cooker packed with residue and a nonstick with a good amount of residue. I then just for shits and giggles unroll the 10 bill and that mother fucker had 3 massive chips of heroin stuck to it from when I crushed powder last. I ended up getting everything into one cooker and actually such a good shot I got a decent rush off it, I was thoroughly surprised and am now feeling quit sleepy and warm.

My question is: is it okay to start Suboxone at 24+ hours out, even if my withdrawal symptoms are minimized by the supportive meds? Obviously I know none of them act on opioid receptors, but I'm worried about precipitated withdrawal because I don't feel nearly as shitty as I would without the meds (normally I'm gnarly-sick by about 18 hours without them).

Another side-point... I do sometimes go to a middle or go to a shitty dealer when I need to... especially if I know they have some fire at the moment. But, on average, I avoid those situations and stick with whoever is doing their job the best. 

Recently, I had a few shitty pick-ups when using a middle which really sucked, but it isn't my place to say shit to them or their dealer. In those situations, I just suck it up and deal with it, but like I said, I avoid those interactions. They're always a last resort. Part of what sparked this for me is seeing how the middles don't say shit to the dealer.

He sells $40 bags. How much is average pay for a delivery person? Ideally I would like drugs and money but no idea what to ask for so I don't get taken advantage of or look greedy.

Hi, I'm a regular on r/opiates but I don't want some people who know my name and me IRL to know about this for my own reasons.

My Dude was saying he needs someone to drive for him. That's pretty much how it works in my city, you have to know someone, make a phone call, and they say where to meet. This particular Dude has always insisted on coming and dropping it off right at my door (which is usually awesome, but sometimes annoying if he takes forever). Anyway.

I'm a respectable looking (but tough), blonde, white girl, no record, no speeding tickets (I'm 26 and have only been pulled over one time for a brake light) so I don't think I would raise any suspicions. I feel good about doing it, especially since he always goes to people's houses I wouldn't have to worry as much about getting robbed. I wouldn't have to worry about the police as much either.

My question is, he asked how much I would want for deliveries. I'm not sure. They are $40 bags. Should I ask for a certain amount of money each bag? For each delivery? A set amount no matter how busy it is just for being on call? Should I ask for the 2 bags I do daily and certain amount of money for gas? I have no idea. What's the going rate? He has a pretty steady business going on so this is really like a legit job from ~11am -6pm. I don't want to be taken advantage of but I don't want to come off as greedy. I really want this job is good for me as I have a disability and can take quick breaks when I need.

I was thinking of asking for ten from each bag, but that seems kind of high. I would be spending some of that back with him to get my own bags though. Not sure what kind of deal to work out. Have any of you ever done this? What did you get? Thanks!

I'm interested in getting beyond those. What would you like me, an open-minded outsider to this world, to know?

More specifically, I am currently in pharmacy school, and interested in working in the world of addiction. We're learning from a fairly progressive instructor who has worked in the field for a long time, but there is obviously a lot of information and knowledge that can only come from living in a world, and not just working on the edge of that world. Help me learn things my instructor doesn't know!

Edit: lots of people asking for specific things I want to know, so I'll put together a list of some things that of love to know more about:
* jargon/slang terms: I see references to ""rigs"" somewhat regularly, which is a term that, afaik, isn't used in pharmacy. From context, I interpret this to mean ""syringe+needle"". Is that accurate? Is there more to it? What other terms ate there that I probably don't hear, but are used regularly?
* needle/syringe info: how particular are you about the setup you use? Does the distinction between a 22 gauge 5/8"" needle and a 26 gauge 1"" needle mean anything to you? Does it matter to you?
* if I were to implement a policy in my pharmacy that provided a pamphlet on local resources (needle exchanges, detox/treatment programs, etc) with all syringes sold, would that make you feel more comfortable coming in? Less comfortable? What about if they were simply made available for anyone to pick up, like a pamphlet on blood pressure or diabetes might be?
* I'm mostly looking for things beyond the treatment and policy issues (since those are covered by my classes), and looking more for information that will help me empathize with you, and approach policy/legal questions with your best interests in mind (as opposed to what I might think would help you).

And if any of you have questions for me, feel free to ask, either here or by pm. I'll do my best to provide a useful answer.",1447186134.0

Any idea what the problem is? From what I've heard your heart rate slows down when you fall into REM sleep. So the only thing I can even kind of come up with is that since my heart rate is already really slow from the dope it doesn't allow me to fall into REM because it would slow my heart rate even further.

I was in the worst withdrawal I've ever had and my lower back was killing me. Every time I peddled it felt like a thousand jagged knives with flaming tips rained down on my back. So once I get near his house, I see my friend who told me his car was broken pulling up and into dboy's parking space.  
  
At that moment I wasn't even upset at him, I was just glad that I was going to get high and have a ride back home. So once I got there my friend had just finished his pickup and we talked at the door about giving me a ride home for two OP40s. So at this point I was happy as can be, and handed the dboy my money. He gave me a norco on top because he felt bad that I had to bike all the way out there. On my way out, my so called friend fuckin' took off as soon as I was at the door. Like literally I had my hand on the door knob and was about to turn it when I heard his POS ricer ass civic take off. Ended the evening having to bike back all the way home and gaining a whole new perspective on friendship.  
Today was not my day but fuck it I'm as high as Ben Franklin's kite.  
  
*Have you ever caught a friend lying or have been caught in lie? Let me hear your story.*  
  
**TLDR - Asked a friend for a ride to dealers house and he blatantly lied saying he couldn't because his car was broken so I rode a bike for an hour to score. Saw my friend there and said he could give me a ride back to our apartment complex but took off as soon as I was about to leave dboy's house.**

So we picked up from my middle girl. Had to drive her to dudes house and her back AND THEN she forgot her phone in my car so as we're leaving the ghetto its time to turn back around and go back. But after we finally got back I slammed a speedball and we all had a blast of a time regardless of the too much driving and rain. Plus dude gets raw and just barely cut it so the bags are just small rocks of dope. good shit for sure. I also got some hard and one rock was about the size of a molar tooth.

I simply put half of an OP 80 into a shot glass of soda. Left it in over night. I was left with a blob and some icky soda. 

Tasted nasty, but i definitely got a nice rush. 

So my questions;

- Is there a way to speed up the process? If I break up the OP into multiple pieces and put it in the soda, how long would it generally take until it will work? 
- What I don't understand is that in the morning I was left with a big gooey blob. Was the oxy actually dissolved in the soda or did the blob actually hold the oxy.
- I understand that it works because the acid in the soda mimics stomach acid, but what is the science behind it? I guess I'm trying to figure out what exactly was in that blob.

And it was awkward as fuck. Mind you, I've been eating Xanax and doing dope all day so my coordination is shit.

So I'm in the Midwest, and as you guys know, its dark as fuck right now. Well, we were on our way for a delivery and the guys (fucking including  young sketch) wanted McDs. Cool, we can stop through there. Of course, shit didn't go as planned because well fuck me it never does.

We pull up and there's a HUGE fucking line. Awesome. So much for being quick. Before we even order our food, Young Sketch breaks out the blow. So we're sitting in a drive through doing lines off a book, in the dark. That was probably the first mistake. My second mistake was deciding to do a shot while we wait. I slowly but surely dose, cook, and draw up my shot before we order. I figured I'd slam it after I get past the boards. 

Surprisingly up until this point, I had shit under control with these fucks. Which I have to admit, I like containing bees in crack. We're one car away from the window when I register and start feeling fucking great. We pull up to the window and I go to hand this chick a credit card (young sketch's card, mind you) when I notice a huge problem. Not only is there fuck blow all over an edge of this card, there is also blood dripping down my hand. You know small trickles that  appear but there's no obvious cut or scrape? One of those. And we both saw it at the same time. I could see the look of horror in her face.  I have a split second to a) let blood drip all over or b) get rid of the powder. Of course, my brain isn't functioning properly and my hand kind of jerked and dropped the card on the fucking ground. YAY. I have no choice but open my door and pick it up. Which also doesn't goes as planned. 

I'm leaning out of the car, finally find the fucking thing, and proceed to immediately smack the back of my head on the door. FUCK ME. eventually this chick gets the card, and still sees the dried blood on my hand and kindly tells me I'm bleeding. Thanks. I know. You know I know. Go away.

But of course this wouldn't be the end of my troubles! Oh no. It's not. We're now waiting for our food and we're still doing coke. We've been passing around the illustrated version of HP (which is huge, btw) with lines busted down. Guess who fucked up? Young Sketch. 3 times in about 2 minutes. 

1. His hand has a spasm (similar to mine about 4 minutes previously) and sends 3 lines of blow down the front of me and the center counsel. Im wearing a black coat. Come on. Really? 

2. Because of said spasm, the book fell into those awkward pits of hell where nothing is fucking retrievable. So he leans forward to grab it for me where apparently his peice slid out under the passenger seat and into the front. No one noticed because we were concerned about having coke all over the place. 

3. He finally gets his stupid fucking blow, and hands me the book back where I hastily shove in the crevice of the windshield because its our turn to get food. So I pull up when my guy sees it. There's still a line on the fucking book, in CLEAR VIEW of the McDs worker. Fuck. 

I just say fuck it there is NOTHING I can do because lady is on her way to hand us our drinks. As she's handing us our drinks, see her glace at the book, twice. I'm pretty sure the fat fucking line of coke is VERY obvious. Especially under that drive thru lighting they have. As she hands us one back where I notice her staring at the floor of our car with a very concerned look. I sneak a peak as I turn around to hand off the bag, and I saw the fucking barrel out of the corner of my eye. Lovely. Not to mention the fact that  Young Sketch is talking 500 miles a minute and is VERY geeked out, trying to apologize for spilling it still VERY LOUDLY and using the word ""blow"". There's no way everyone in that fucking place didn't hear him. 

I say thank you as she hands us the last bag, and before she lets go she looks me dead in the eye and says a little too softly, ""you might want to check your nose."" Fuck fuck fuck. 

We FINALLY make it out of that fucking food debacle and are on our way. Needless to say, we escaped unscathed, but I was still pissed. Shit could have gone south, quick. I really hate that kid. 




Tl;dr--- I threatened to shove a ball of blow up Young Sketch's ass because he's an idiot.

Luckily I don't have enough supply for getting into deep trouble with this substance.

I've been dosing BF daily(from morning until I go to bed) for almost a week. There is something about BF that I cant stay away from it. I don't get sick when not dosing, it doesn't give me euphoria, it just simply calms my brain, but in a weird way.

The only drug I've had this issue with before is weed. I simply cant stay away. And it's not in an addict type of way. I've previously been mildly addicted to benzos, speed(Psychological) and oxy, this is nothing like that.

I really had no issue resisting oxy when I felt that it had gotten out of hand, I went though short withdrawals for a few days and that was it. I had oxy at home when I stopped and it wasn't a problem to avoid, sure my addiction hadn't went so far, but still. With weed and BF it's impossible for me to leave it alone if I have it available. The worst part is that BF doesn't really give me anything of value. 

But as I mentioned before, my supply is running out, luckily, and I will keep my doses minimal until Friday, so I don't have to go into work fully sober on Friday. Then let my body rest during the weekend.

I've been lurking for a little while and casually commented on some stuff on here.  This is a really cool place and I wish I found it earlier.   Anyways, I am a stone cold junkie, through and through.  Started with the 40s and 80s OC (originals) and then 30mg roxi's, then found the needle with the ECP.  Addiction took me down man.  Lost a ton, a couple of rehab visits, drug counselors, urine tests, money, debt, etc same old shit.  Finally got clean in 2011, after my second OD.  Long and short of it, the day I got out of rehab (the last time) I figured I would get high one more time, copped two buns, did a 5-bag shot nbd, then luckily I was staying at my parents that night.  I did another before bed at midnight, ODed, fell out hard, woke up in the hospital the next day in absolutely EXCRUCIATING pain.  I fell out on top of my arm in a very contorted position - they didn't find me for 8 hours.  My arm was really fucked up and I had to stay in the hospital for 27 days.  Four surgeries later, they took out about 20% of the muscle and fat from my arm that had ""died"" without any blood or oxygen to them (pics below, don't know if I linked correctly)  I got a little IV morphine for a day after each of the surgeries (which was amazing) but other than that was treated like a scum of the earth junkie and they basically gave me like (1) 2mg dialudid orally every 8 hours.  Did nothing.  Pain was a 20/10.   Really not fun.  6 months of physical therapy 3x week and occupational therapy 3x a week I gained functionality in my hand back.  Now 4 years later I just have a really nasty scar - and a daily reminder to not pick up again.   Still have no feeling in the front of my left leg and the back of my right leg due to nerve damage.

So I know there are other subs that would be a better match for this question, but I always like to ask you all first since this is my favorite community and I have a feeling I can get some interesting / rare advice here that I won't get from places like a depression sub since you all know quite a bit about medicines. NOTE: I am not assuming you are all doctors, and will not just instantly take any potential medicine suggested without doing lots of research or asking my doc, but I'd love to hear some potentially outside-the-box solutions:

I have been at the max allowed dosage of Wellbutrin for a while. I know this medication has extremely mixed reviews, but I absolutely love it, and since it actually breaks down into amphetamines (according to my doc so I trust this) it gives me energy and confidence all day.

Unfortunately, since I have been on the max dose for so long, it doesn't work nearly as well as it used to, so I have started drinking a ton of coffee to supplement it. Usually when I bring this issue up with my doctors, they offer prescribing some shitty SNRI or something to ""supplement"" or even potentiate the wellbutrin.

Since I am terrified of SSRI's/SNRI's, and I know the doctor doesn't know or have the ability to suggest other less traditional alternatives, my two big questions are:

1) If you take wellbutrin, especially if you have the same issue where you're maxed out dosage wise and your tolerance has gotten too high, what drugs/medications (legit prescription medications, smart drugs, or any non-traditional or illicit drugs) would you recommend to potentiate wellbutrin? Coffee works well most days but sometimes still doesn't quite cut it, and too much caffeine comes with nasty shaking/anxiety side effects.

AND

2) I feel like most people don't think about this as much which is why I wanted to ask you-- are there any medications/drugs that could, instead of potentiatiating the wellbutrin, lower my tolerance for it? Optimally I would just like to have wellbutrin be my main medication for energy/motivation, so it would be great if there is something (especially on the low-risk side but open to all suggestions) that could just help it work for me like it used to when I could take it and really get the full effects.


I am not really a stimulant person (definitely not interested in using meth or something that intense), but am still open to any ideas or things that have worked for other people to help wellbutrin do its job to the fullest.

thanks in advance for any advice I can get, and happy nods!",1447424403.0

""It's supposed to be an opioid receptor blocker, once you get on a daily dose of methadone it fills up your opioid receptors so that you don't crave opiates and even if you were to do opiates while on methadone, there would be no room in your receptors for it to fill up so it wouldn't have any effect on you. It also has a much longer half life, so it will stay in your system a lot longer and will keep you from going through withdrawals, but because the half life is so long, it takes that much longer to get out of your system, and because it acts on your opioid receptors, your body will then go through withdrawals from methadone if not taken. Methadone also builds up inside of your bones so that it takes it even longer to get out of your system, and you will get extreme aches in your bones. Now I'm not saying that there aren't any benefits to it, but from my experience with it, it was complete hell, and the withdrawals were horrible, I didn't sleep for 2 weeks straight, and that was even after I tapered down to a recommended mg to quit cold turkey. I think that it could be used to help in some way, but from what I've been through it just seems like a lot of them treat it as the business it is, but these clinics literally have no incentive to get patients to quit, it's like a tobacco company trying to get you to quit smoking cigarettes.""",1447410626.0

I'd been injecting heroin for about 3 years,  a graduation from sniffing and smoking on foil. After so much time being careless with my veins I found it harder and harder to hit. At first I could do it in a moving car. For a while I could hit up right after scoring, parked in a ""safe"" spot. Then, as I started to take longer and longer I decided to wait till I got home. It then got to a point where I would sit on my bed for 45 to an hour + trying to find that perfect register. There were times when I was so sick and frustrated I wanted to cry, and did. I thought it was no use doing it any other way because only IV could cure my sickness: naseua, vomiting, sore legs and back, insomnia, hot and cold flashes, as well as the mental anguish. However,  one day I just decided to smoke my stuff instead. I remembered how I enjoyed the process, and the taste, and blowing out big clouds of smoke. I smoked a large amount and it didn't seem to hit me, until 20 minutes later when I was on my ass. 

Since that day, I haven't touched any rigs. I thought I would go back to it, but I decided it was time to let my arms heal, and to stop worrying about those pesky abscesses. I was hoping my tolerance would go down and to my surprise it really seems like it has. I haven't thrown up once since I stopped. I don't get the brick in my stomach feeling. I'm actually able to use the bathroom comfortably (to a certain extent, but constipation is far less severe). Now,  I'm not going to act like I don't get dopesick. And just because something is not as bad as it could be doesnt mean its not still bad. But I feel far less of that desperation mode feeling I would get - my symptoms are less harsh, my mental state is improved and I feel like waiting a long-time to score isn't as life or death as it once was. I also felt a strange feeling I hadn't felt in some time - I was actually proud of myself for at least using my DOC in a way that's a bit safer. Now,  it's certainly not all great as its causing me to cough a lot more (and I don't smoke cigs). 

The other day, I had asked my mom for 30 dollars. She reluctantly gave it to me and I noticed it was two 20s and a 10. After a long mental debate I decided to tell her she gave me to much. Our relationship has been rocky but it really meant a lot to her that I was honest. Back when I was shooting up, there's no way I would have given that back. 

I know this post was long and rambling, and this is just a baby step towards quitting, but I'm just happy that I feel like I can show self control - something I thought I would never be able to do again. ",1447405309.0

I've been a lurker for awhile but really wanted to get to know you guys.

It's funny and interesting how fast you can get caught in this stuff. I started the same: chipping and thinking I had control, all the way down to daily use, only within a series of months. I'm one of the lucky ones that didn't start until I was a bit older and stable with a great job (which I'm terrified of losing by the way), so for that I am thankful. 

I think in the back of my head I always knew it would come to this. I just love the opioids so much. I personify it, I fantasize about it, it's really all I ever think about. 

Really I've done pretty much every drug I can find within the span of a year and I have some pretty wide sources, but heroin is just unbeatable, unless it's with its good friend cocaine. Coke is my second favorite, and enjoy using that often as well. I don't mean for that come off as bragging or anything, I'm just giving a frame of reference for my obsession with heroin.

I know I have a problem, that's a good start right? 

I guess I don't have that much to say, and I'm not looking for anyone to talk me out of anything, I just wanted to say hi give a bit about myself. Speedballing is just awesome, in truest sense of the word, and I am simply heavy with euphoria. Stay safe out there friends, I'm always open to talking, but might be busy unless it's the weekend.

Bring this to the courts attention since they wanted to bs me on getting a public defender. Looked up some revised codes, tell the judge that this is grounds for dismisal. Charge was a whoole different class and completely wrong. Ask to have my police report read and stenographer notes of verdict entered as evidence on my behalf. Judge was like 'oh, well we'll change it'. So totally got fucked. Had to drop $725 on bail. Court on the 24th. Prolly going back to jail. Just pissed i did all the research and just because im not a lawyer and just some junkie he 'finds me guilty' of 'violating the terms of my probation' instead of throwing it out. Just got out like 4 hours ago and im still going to press the dismisal. Wish me luck yall. It wont be my 1st win as a jailhouse lawyer. Other than that, how have yall been?

Not a very high tolerance. Please help! Need suggestions on how to do this safely. Need harm reduction advice!!,"So I've got some #4 very pure Heroin coming in. Not street shit, this stuff is supposed to be ridiculously fucking pure off the brick. I don't really have much of a tolerance at all. I can do maybe a blue roxy or 2 a day but that's all. They fuck me up but I want to save money since I'm trying to save up. 

Some really important questions I have for you guys-
How do I tell if it's Fentanyl cut? Snort a very tiny amount like less than a MG and see if it's too potent, and go from there? I have no idea how to differ the taste of fent and smack. This is one thing I am very worried about. This source is reviewed a LOT and many are happy with the quality but I'm sure all of these people have a waay higher tolly than me.

Another important question- What amount do I start out with? About what dose is equivalent to a blue Roxy, this is PURE FIRE #4 heroin we're talking about. Nothing like the stepped on shit you'd find on the street.


I just want to be as SAFE as possible. I do not have a test kit and don't have the money for one. I don't even think it's possible to find fent with a test kit anyway. 

Please help and I'll take any suggestions to be as safe as fucking possible using this for my first time. I know this is very potent shit. 
Don't try to convince me not to try it - I've already made up my mind. Nothing is going to convince me from trying this H. I really really want to. I just want to be as safe as possible. I need harm reduction advice!!

Thanks guys I reallyyy do appreciate it. I know not to ever mix painkillers with benzos so no worries. And I really have no intention of ever IVing and I reallyyy don't want to get into that. Snorting only, no smoking.",1447387665.0

I was usually oxi, Opana or H and I always maintained my coke usage through it all. I did not realize, but they say it became noticeable almost overnight and then watched me progressively get worse. 



At 34 , the wife some friends and my parents had an intervention and that began a 3 year process of being in and out of treatments, halfway houses, relapses and finally at some point I had enough and actually tried to listen to what people that had time did. I went to meetings, help others, volunteered and humbled myself for the first time in my life. At the beginning of this I was pretty sure my wife was going to leave me but because we have children (current age 12 and 10 – both girls) she stuck with me and as a surprise to me things got better as time went be. 


I was able to string together 3 years, got a great job and the relationship with my wife, children and others around me improved and were meaningful. About 5 momths ago a guy that works for me was obviously fucked up at work. I say him down and told him I had been there before and wanted to help. We worked together for a while and I tried to help but something about seeing those eyes sparked something and it only to that one time where I did not have a suffiencent defense for not picking up to where I saw that bottle of pills in his briefcase, looked at the lable and took 5 norco 10’s in the split second and took them down. 


It all happen do damn fast, I mean It was so impulsive that it was almost like it was not me. I felt guilty for a while and then the warmth kicked in and that is all it took. From that point forward it did no take long until I was back on the dope or fent and using heavily. I had begun texting my IT guy all the time as he was getting my shit. This went on for months until 2 days ago when I got laid off. The layoff was about 12 people and classified as a major slowdown in the industry so the wife and everyone thought it was bad luck. 


Well, my boss thought it was off the number of text messages between me and the IT kid that I’m not sure how but he was able to get the contents of our texts and wow, it was fucking over now. I was totally exposed for my relapse and how bad it was but to my wife and others around me everything was still great. My old boss and father in law are best friends, so boss man calls father in law who calls me and says gig is up, we know everything. 


My father in law said he would plan to have my kids sleep at their house tomorrow, but I must come clean to my wife tomorrow night. She is going to be devastated and probably leave me. I should have thought about that when I picked up. That’s not really my biggest concern, I just know if I’m kicked out the house it will have such a huge emotional toll on the kids. The safety they feel with both of us together in the house with dad tucking them in at night and taking them to school provided that blanket of security the needed and now I risk it may be gone.  


I know it’s my fault and I must face the consequences of my actions, but anyone got any advice at all on approach to deal with wife and subsequent fallout. I’m really tired of disappointing everyone around me. Picked up a chip tonight, but it’s actions that matter not a piece of tin.

It all began when I realized I would be paid early this morning (Wed late night, Thursday early) around 2am. Since I have DD (direct deposit) it comes in at weird times. Now I'm currently clean for the most part. I take 4mg of Suboxone daily and have done so now for months.  I occasionally will splurge and buy myself a bundle or two from time to time.  Seeing as my pay was due I texted one of my connects about meeting up (this was Wed night) today. He isn't the greatest but I'm kinda hard up for connects since moving to the suburbs of New Jersey after ten years in NYC.  He surprised me by saying he'd meet me at 7am today(Thursday).

I was pleasantly surprised by the early time since I had a very long shift ahead of me being as its prep day for Friday.  Planning to meet him nearby on my way to work I went to sleep with dreams of dope bag fairies dancing in my head.  Usually I'm not a morning person but I popped outta bed today with spring in my step with the constan thought of heroin propelling my every step.  My connection actually texts me to make sure I'm up, I reply with an enthusiastic yes!  After getting dressed I decided to check my bank balance via mobile app to see how much I was paid because I had recently gotten a raise and wasn't sure if this check would have it included. Nothing could ruin this amazing day, I thought to myself!  I'll be pleasantly high for the long, grueling shift ahead. Taking my suboxone wasn't even a thought anymore...I WAS GONNA SHOOT DOPE GOSH DARNIT!

Checking Account Balance: $-0.60 

What. The. Fuck. Immediately I run to a computer to see if maybe the app was wrong? Yeah, I was grasping at fucking straws at this point. Nope, still no DD no matter what screen projected it.  Quickly I texted him and told him there was a major problem in my acquisition of funds.  Now he replies saying maybe it would be late due to the holiday Wednesday.  This actually made sense but didn't change the fact I've basically had my heart set on this and its been ripped from my chest now. Literally carved out with a dull knife then placed on the ground. Actually I'm pretty sure it felt like someone had rubbed ground glass into said gaping hole in my chest and gangrene had set in.

This is kinda getting long but bare with this whiney dope fiend, almost done. Its now 7am and the dude has to go be responsible by going to work.  I sweep up my shattered dreams and take my suboxone, cause I figure I won't see any money(which is needed for heroin and happiness), in at least 24 hours.  After I get to work I call my bank which informs me they see no DD which is very odd as it's usually like clockwork. Now it's getting to be 12 in the afternoon and all I can dwell on is why my existence is such shit. 

Then a miraculous sign was shown to me...well not that miraculous just a phone call from the bank. She informed me that there was a wave of DDs coming in at 2pm and that they couldn't guarantee mine was part of it but to check anyways.  That mobile app is really convenient when your madly refreshing your account info. I checked that shit more times then some homebums that are greeking check and recheck scratch tickets found on the ground.  The skies finally did part and reveal to me a balance so inspiring and divine that I nearly broke down weeping in front of my employer.

This sudden turn of fortune though created a new set of obstacles. Main one being how and when my connect would be available and the fact I ingested 4mg of Suboxone.  After texting my dude and trying to get him to meet me after I finished work, which he gladly obliged. The suboxone blocking me was an obstacle I had no easy solution to but fuck it I said, I'll cross that bridge if I even get to it. Fuck, I'll sleep below said bridge if need be.

Lemme wrap this up folks, got home around 4:30 and met up with dude around 5:15. Procured said bundle and rushed home with a quickness. Now I realize the suboxone is gonna hinder my ability to fully get blasted but like they say...try, try, and motherfucking try again!

I did three bags which resulted in a a nice rush and I'm pleasantly buzzed sitting here writing this. It's not the most exciting read for you guys but I needed to vent about my day. Thankfully the stakes weren't super high as my habit isn't dope but suboxone currently. Anyway I'll take a picture of the seven remaining bags if anyone's curious.

Good luck everyone and be safe out there!

I don't know if you guys even give a fuck but I just want to vent somewhere being here sick as a dog. I got a connect who has provided me with the dope 6 years straight, always available and delivers. So right now I am living in another city and in the beginning of every month when I get my disability support for my back problems I take a bus to the city I lived before and meet up with the guy and buy myself a week or two worth of dope.

So few days ago the money came and I made the decision to travel 3 hours by bus to him and buy some dope. He says he is empty but can cop from me elsewhere. This should have been a huge red flag because this dude ALWAYS had huge amounts of dope stashed away and never went copping for others but since I knew him so long and I had zero problems with him I didn't even begin to suspect something.

So I arrive at the city, he picks me up and we drive to another neighborhood, he has a friend along with him who also supposedly wants to cop and who I also know. I also know that this friend is known to absolutely rage and go nuts when someone scams him, like absolutely furious. 

Well, we pull up and he says hand me the money. I hand him my money and his friend does the same and he leaves the car and leaves his phone in the car (btw the whole 40min car ride he never made a call to the ""dude"" to come out or something, OK maybe he buzzed a door but later when he came back he said they met up under a tree in a park). He comes back with two 5g bags and hands them both to me (wtf?) while the other dude was in the back in withdrawals wanting his stuff also.

I immediately notice something is off and sure enough, the stuff is just pure glucose. Also what was extremely suspect was that this time I wanted to buy 10g instead of usual 5g so when he came back with 2 5g bags he said the dude he copped from will bring the 3rd 5g bag to the car in 5 minutes.

Like he couldn't anticipate me copping more and premade 2 5g sugar bags. While I am freaking out they are incredibly call ""If we got scammed we got scammed, shit happens"".


Mind you, this is not the kind of dude to take this thing lightly (getting scammed) and he is not even on that level to get scammed by someone selling sugar bags...


I already know they fucked me and slowly start bringing up the subject and the dude is like ""What the fuck dude, I should drop you right here and go walk 200 miles home. Have I ever fucked with you?"" etc etc... It was like the perfect circlejerk and scam because he really never fucked me before during 6 years and It wouldnt make sense for him to do it now since hes my only connect and I bring him money but he knows that even if he scams me next time I will still buy from him. So a perfect chance for him to scam me...


So literally I cried in frustration the whole bus ride home, with now money only for 1 pack cigarettes and 10pack noodles...


Right now I am sitting in my room, my back pain is crushing me and the withdrawals are making me want to crawl out of my skin... I just can't believe how he could do me like that :'(
I am so disappointed and sad and even fucking suicidal...



I know I am not a very good storyteller, part because I am in shivering like a motherfucker and probably gonna jump off a bridge, got 0.5mg Suboxone and 2 2mg K-pins and nothing else...


What angers me the most is that the scam itself was so petty and simple, like no respect at all and out of the blue...

tl;dr: got scammed by my long time connect who probably has gotten over 100000$ from me for a petty amount and feeling just so sad and disappointed I had to vent.",1447363440.0

I was very dissapointed to say the least as i had done my research and most people online said to not even bother with codeine if your opiate tolerant. 

Just for example my usual dose to get me a somewhat pleasant high is around 15 hydros in a day (10 mg of course), but lately my tolerance has been so high i sometimes don't even feel that. 

It sucks big time! After doing my research i figured out that i need a huge dose of codeine to even get me a little high, so as soon as i got the script went home and cold water extracted 15 of them (450 MG) and chugged it. At first it was VERY unpleasant experience, my skin turned bright red and i had an itch all over my body (not like the pleasant itch you usually get, but a burning annoying itch) At first i thought I was allergic, but than found out this is a very common side effect of codeine because it has histamine in it, after downing 2 shots of nyquil, all the unpleasent side effects vanished within 20 mins, after that i was left with a mind blowing high, unable to move just want to close my eyes feeling. Even today I had 8 pills left and decided to do the rest, started with 5 of them, got a huge buzz and than killed the last 3, wow i feel almost as good as yesterday, although i still prefer hydrocodone as the codeine after a while puts you OUT and hydros instead give me energy. Just thought i would share my little story and ask, am i just lucky that if affects me so well? or do people exaggerate about how useless codeine is?",1447359700.0

I have been working out though everyday since i saw them last about two weeks ago and have been eating a lot and taking creatine so i def gained some weight and muscle in that department and this def helps a decent amount. what is my problem is my face. NOW they can ALWAYS tell by my face and my eyes being pinned and like these junkie looking lines and shadow things (as my dad says) around my eyes. and i get these diagonal line like things between my cheeks and eyes  when i talk and blink or open and close my eyes that he  and my mom always notices. now what the fuck should i dooo????? should i get a little high tomorrow or do nothing at all. if i stay sober im gonna be sick as fuck as this binge has been superrr long. So saturday i will obviously be sick looking too and i am sure they will say something if when they pick me up i look like a withdrawing mess (i cant say im sick or have the flu either because i just spoke to them on the phone and know im fine plus i never get sick) So should i do a little tomorrow to get well and maybe take lope on saturday? or lope all day tomorrow and all day saturday?? Does that stuff really work i never take it but I see people worship it on here. I have no acess to kratom. I am coming off like maybe a little less that a .5 a day injected like .25 upon wakeup and then .25 in the evening. Now what i have: I have a box of lope like 20 2mg tablets (generic not immodium, i hope thats ok) 3 suboxone 8 mg pills (which i dont think is wise to take because my eyes get pinned and i have that junkieish look in my face and even when i take like 2mg they can tell). i have like 7 1 mg klonopin which if i take a full 1 mg also give me this junkie look in my face and my dad notices. i also have like 20 300mg gabapentin....so please what should i do??? im so sorry i know i should have done the sub today like u guys said but i was for some reason paid back with dope i didnt even know i was owed form a while ago. please understand why i couldnt listen to u guys FREE DOPE lol. its like the universe wants me to continue to get high or maybe the sub would have thrown me into precip wd and that would have gotten me caught who knows.

He was from South Jersey and 21 years old and leaves behind a very young adorable daughter who looks just like him and he was the sole care taker of due to the babie's mother being a young heroin addict who ""wasn't ready or willing"" to raise a child.  He reminded me so much of me and he was a self-proclaimed ""drug nerd.'  Which just goes to reiterate the fact that heroin doesn't care if you have a PHD in drugs, or the illicit world of Research Chems and the DNMs.

 he was trying so hard and he had made it 6 months clean from everything for the first time in his short life.  he stopped hurting himself as well.  he was supposedly at a girls house last night and he disappeared into the bathroom for 10-15 minutes only to emerge 'incredibly tired.'  and when he exited the bathroom he told the girl's who house it was that he was 'so tired that he needed to lay down.'  20 minutes after he retired to the home owner's bed to take a nap the girl checked on him and he was dead.  

 if you haven't told your parents or significant other or your child that you love them today.  And make sure that you do because who knows if that next shot you take will be your ticket to the the other side.  Or if someone you know has an addiction to opiates and you haven't heard from them in a while maybe give them a call or check up on them because, it makes me sad to say, but dying silently and alone is par for the course of this life.

I have been wanting to chime in with you guys. I enjoy reading the post sober or not. I finally had dude come through with blues a few hours before my Friday is over. Dealing with legal issues and pretty much stranded at home, I only get to indulge once a week so tonight is the night. Music has been a passion of mine my whole life and I've been playing for a little over 13 years. I played for a long time before ever using any substance. I started on drums and then guitar. They kind of went hand in hand creating a better sense of rhythm and having a general feel for song writing. For me, my opiate music is Tycho by far. Sober or not, listening to or playing along with my favorite artist has always given me sensations of well being and joy. I think a lot about what music does to the brain, and came up with this theory: While on my DOC (oxy) I found that my nod and buzz was increased when listening to the music that I know creates dopamine reactions in my brain, thus, playing, listening to, and combining those is like combining the natural dopamine reaction with the chemically induced reactions. I always felt like that combination was a way to exponentially increase my high. Many great musicians have fallen due to the blissful experience of shredding and getting lost in playing while buzzed, and experiencing this 'bliss' as well allows me to believe it's more than an addiction when it comes to playing music. It becomes an enhancing force in two ways. One way, with both dopamine reactions at play, I feel better. The other allows my playing to seem more fluid as well. This also effected my will to play after some years. When sober I find it hard to pick up the guitar. In my mind I don't want to because I know what I COULD feel like. But, I still do it because I know it will yield a good feeling for just one moment. Think about the feeling you get when you hear your favorite song. Use those experiences to chime in.

With heat added, and substantial heat too, the paste turns to a clear, beautiful amber color which is what I know dope to normally be like. When I have been able to shoot hot, the rush is phenomenal and the legs are pretty damn good too. However, occasionally if I take a little bit too long, the mixture turns back into a paste/mud substance. A few times, this has happened in the syringe and proceeded to ruin the tool. I don't think I should have to shoot this hot, and actually a few times the mixture will remain the clear amber, mostly when I am doing left over residue in the spoon. There is ALWAYS residue left over, no matter what. So just to clarify, when I get the rock, it sometimes turns back to paste after heating. When I am doing residue, more than often after water and heat it will remain consistently liquid. I am trying to figure out what I am doing wrong/how to improve my situation.

Oxycodone cross-tolerance?","Like a lot of people on this sub I'm a drug addict. 

From 17-22 I was able to maintain a relatively healthy balance between drugs/life. Back then, despite being prone to depression and anxiety, it never occurred to me to try and self-medicate. Getting high was purely recreational. I wanted to have fun and party; basically that was it.

I was even introduced during that period, via the family medicine cabinet, to the magic of pain pills. Specifically testing out tramadol, dihydrocodeine and oxy at various points; I loved the trams and DHC yet ironically recall thinking oxy was overrated!

It's a cliche, but my motivations for ingesting substances were irrevocably altered the moment I tried meth. In fact I started displaying addictive compulsions straight away. Within a year things had escalated to the point where I was smoking meth daily, with a complementary diet of benzos and alcohol to take the edge off. I last took meth in July 2012 after 16 months of abuse. In the following year I snorted heroin about 7 times.

Fast-forward to the fall of 2013; I ultimately replaced my icky meth habit with an oxycodone addiction. I started taking oxy daily and soon became physically addicted. After 80mgs stopped getting me high and my finances dwindled I bought heroin again(it was my first period of daily use). At that point I needed to snort a lot of it to get high and daily use via insuffulation didn't seem feasible to me. At least not with that batch or my tolerance at the time.

After WDs and a few more oxy and heroin relapses, with the help of kratom I stopped using all other opiates in December 2014. I began taking oxycodone again in May, once more my use rose to about 80mgs a day. I kicked that habit with the aid of no other substances in late July. I should indicate that even when I've been clean from opiates or indeed meth I have gone through cycles of poly-drug abuse and have rarely been truly 'clean' any longer than 4 weeks. 

A month ago, I started abusing amphetamines(dexedrine), benzos and lyrica, alternating my use so as to not be taking the same drug everyday. I stopped for one week then I bought a batch of OC 40s and 1 gram of heroin. 10 days ago I started using oxy again, dosing 20mgs initially. Since then I've been alternating my drug abuse, usually taking dexedrine and valium one day, lyrica + sometimes xanax, Oxy the next. To give you an idea of my opiate tolerance - I dosed 40mgs of oxy on Thursday and it was a great high.

I've only used the H a couple of times and gotten a good buzz off small amounts. I figure that realistically, being who I am, I will finish this bag off at some stage(dosing low), quite possibly after the Oxys run out. I've always purchased smaller bags of H(then stopped or started eating oxy again) so never snorted H for a prolonged period of time - hence my question.

I'm aware of the inherent stupidity of a drug addict making 'plans'. I don't plan to inject heroin ever but I also didn't plan to become an addict. I don't plan to start taking opiates everyday again, but I recognize the symptoms of opiate abuse, and know that when messing with the monkey all bets are off.

So I know many will discourage me from relapsing into habitual use again, tell me to flush it and so on. But I'm merely being real about things. Not looking for advice just asking to hear about the experiences of others. So, out of those who were addicted to snorting heroin, how long before you had to take a break or advance to a different ROA in order to get high(disregarding China White)?

Loved that shit. It was a one time thing and then I no longer had access to it sadly. Fast forward and I now I have access to the Malli 15 ER morphs. I have plugged a few separate times with these and not having a ton of luck. Here's what I do;

Suck the coating off and then crush into fine powder. Suck up a few cc's of warm water and then pull out the plunger and dump in powder. Shake it up with my thumb over the back and put plunger back and get all air out. Lodge it up there a good ways and push plunger down. Usually try to go to the bathroom first. This is the exact way I prepared and used the IRs and it worked perfect. Not so much with the ERs. Ideas?

To be clear, ER gave me a slight buzz but it was fleeting. I tried doing more to no avail. Any insight is much appreciated. Thanks all!",1447553858.0

I just don't like how I feel lightheaded all over. definitely anixolytic qualities like xanax or valium (sp?).
