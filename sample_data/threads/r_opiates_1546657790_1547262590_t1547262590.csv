Asking because I'm not getting too high, but I have a pretty hefty tolerance, too. It's to the point that I'm literally thinking about just switching to the needle at this point, because I miss catching nods and having that warm glow wash over me. It was literally my favorite feeling in the entire world, and I'm a stranger to that wonderful world these days. I can't remember the last time I melted into a puddle of pure bliss in my chair :(

I snorted 4mg hydromorphone after a year of full abstinence and was hit two days later with a surprise drug test right around the 53 hour mark by DR. I'm very unlucky but I digress.

My question (that I'm getting conflicting answers for) is if Dilaudid will pop your standard five panel urine test.

Never thought I would be able to say that.,"Deleted my old account I use to use here awhile back. January 10th last year I had my bond revoked while out on house arrest. I had so many warrants in other counties, violated probation in 2 counties, my kids were in dcf custody, my wife and I were in an extended stay motel, I had no job, and basically everything had turned to shit. 

So January 10th I got high as hell for the last time and turned myself in. I did 30 days in jail followed by 90 days in a work release type program. That was what really helped me get on my feet. I got a job and got into a program to get certified to work as a welder. I got out in April and right after that was put on 90 days house arrest for the probation violation in another county. 

I kept trucking and just fought all the urges I had to use. Which seemed like a lot for the first 6 months. In August my wife and I became a home owner and the following month got custody of our boys back. I‚Äôve been working as a welder for awhile now and my wife recently got a new job working in HR for the first time. 

It‚Äôs strange having money in the bank, doing things as a family, and not having to look over my shoulder worrying when I‚Äôm going to get taken in on my warrants. For so long it seemed like there was no end in sight and I was just waiting to overdose. It‚Äôs been a long road and after so many attempts and relapses I really feel like I‚Äôve made it. I have 6 days left on probation and that‚Äôs it. All my legal problems are behind me. 

I gotta say though what made it different this time was both my wife and I were so ready to get clean and get our life back after so many years ruining it. We actually wanted it. I still read this sub every day for motivation to stay clean. I love seeing all the posts of people here posting how long they have been clean and all the advice people have for those attempting to get clean. Love you guys!

Water and a high fiber diet. This is best in the long run, but it takes time. Also this is the safest and may push you to kicking for good. 

Gentle laxatives like Metamucil and Exlax. This is second best and safe, but it does not always work and relief is not immediate. 

Harsh laxatives like FLEET and magnesium citrate.  These must only be used infrequently since they are not 100% safe but they work in minutes. The purge is violent but the relief is worth. 

WDs.  I promise you that WDs WILL CLEAN YOU OUT.  You'll also save money, but the sickness is... well you know.  Again the sickness may push you to kicking for good.

So I worked till about 12am with a buddy we got a few bags of ecp sniffed while working I was fine, seemed clean no fetty, Just a little fucked up, no nods or anything just felt decent. I got home took 1mg Xanax and sniffed one more small line. Was watching tv for about an hour. Then had to pee. Now when I do D it takes me forever to piss. So I sat on the toilet pushing on my stomach, and the wall is very close to the toilet, like in front of your face. So I leaned my head against it while pushing on bladder to pee. Well I eventually fell asleep. I woke up, legs obv pins and needles, numb, and toenails especially on left side turned purple but I was on the toilet so the position cut off circulation. I then realized the time being 645am and found out I was sleeping on the toilet for about 4 hours give or take 30 min. My face and lips had color some pins and needles in arms and hands but like I said the position I was in wouldn‚Äôt be very comfortable while awake. I think my limbs fell asleep from the position, but at the same time a bit scared I was close to an OD but again I felt fine before going to bathroom. And was atleast an hour since I dosed last before I went to toilet. Could this have been an OD or just fell asleep. Also another important fact, I worked very late last night as well got like 2 hours sleep max and getting a bit sick (like a cold not dope sick) so when I got home tonight I fell asleep for an hour as soon as I sat down before I even showered or took that last small dose with the Xanax. So being so tired is why I think I fell asleep on toilet but very well may have been close to an OD, but again just think was the weird position I fell asleep in. My face had color and lips were red just my toenails purple but again if you think of the position I was in that makes sense. Just scared me a bit and wondering your guys thoughts. I‚Äôm quite new to D but have a decently high tolerance to oxy, about 120mg to feel decent. And I dosed tonight just a couple lines through the night and again never got too fucked up. No nods, just actually tired due to lack of sleep the night before. Wondering what you guys think. I also have a natural tolerance to Xanax, I can take 6 Mgs by itself and does nothing, might knock me out eventually but nothing much else, but every time I mix .5-1mg with say 100mg oxy i normally  end up falling asleep if I‚Äôm not up and moving around. Thanks guys just a scare on my part since I‚Äôm a bit new to D, I also took more D last night with that same 1mg and was fine. Again just looking for some opinions on if it was sleep or close to the deep sleep? Either way scared me after I realized how long I was in there.

Hit up my dealer if he could come deliver and he said yeah. But I was so fucking tired since I haven‚Äôt adjusted my sleeping schedule and knocked the fuck out as soon as I got home. Woke up and saw his messages saying he was ready to go but that he was gonna leave in a bit. Text read that it was over an hour ago so it was too late. Was internally kicking myself for missing this cus of my nap..


Not wanting to be sick to work tomorrow, I hit him up again and said I‚Äôd be willing to uber to where he was at. He wasn‚Äôt showing up once I reached my destination so I went inside this Pizza Hut nearby cus it was cold af and chilled there till he got here. The employees there didn‚Äôt even ask me to buy anything lol. When I picked up and he asked if I needed to wait for my Uber ride to head back home and I said yeah, he said that I could just wait inside his car cus of the cold and even smoked me out with some of his own personal stash. I was pretty surprised cus he‚Äôs never done that before, so I‚Äôm definitely glad that I ended the night with some dope and getting unexpectedly smoked out from my dealer. 


TLDR; Had a hard day at work, missed a call from my dealer to deliver. So I ubered to his location  instead and he lets me wait inside his car and gives me some of his own personal stash of tar after I picked up my own shit while I was waiting for the Uber to head back home. ",1547189346.0

Hi opi fam, I need to get something off my chest and you guys have always been great support so here it is. 

I went to rehab for 45 days. Got out was going to 12 step meetings the entire time. Didn‚Äôt really buy into it at all but hey it was past an hour of time of me not using. I use to have a really bad cocaine problem like every day from morning to bed and was popping oxys and Xans. Then my fianc√© who was my first love in high school (high school sweet hearts) dropped the hammer enough is enough I‚Äôm leaving. That was enough to get me to quit. Two years later got in terrible wreck fractured spine knee surgery whole nine yards. Was getting so much oxy that got out of control by the end of that year. Oxys were too expensive when my script was over so along cake heroin. Was doing iv speedballs every day. In November last year I didn‚Äôt go to family thanksgiving. (They know I use but not like how much I was using). They called me didn‚Äôt answer for two-three days which is rare for me. I lost my phone and didn‚Äôt care to tell them as I was shooting all day long. They thought I died or was missing so police got involved I figured all this out and admitted I had a big problem. Rehab was great but cravings like mother fucker. My plug who I‚Äôm close with had some A1 coke and of course I indulged the past two days. No heroin as I‚Äôm on suboxone. 

Here‚Äôs my question. (Sorry for all the previous ramble but I felt like I should give you guys a minor background story, now on the question). 
How do you guys that are sober I know there are some in here. Handle a relapse? 
In rehab they told me to be honest and if you relapse you can go back for 30 days again. 
I feel like that‚Äôs a money making scheme. So what have you guys done when you relapsed?",1547187845.0

I have a bunch of subs I've been holding on to for when I'm ready to quit. I've been circling that drain for quite some time now and in the process have opened and partially used a few strips. 

Here is the issue:

All are expired as of 01/2018. Pharmaceuticals are usually good way past their expiration date so I'm not too worried about that

The main issue is the ones that have been opened. They were not protected very well from exposure to air. Do you think they've degraded or become less effective? I want to use them to attempt the Bernese method, I've taken up to 0.5mg at a time with no ill effects or signs of pwd. Not sure if it's just due to the low dose, or the subs are just useless now.


Ideas? Thoughts? Tips on the Bernese method?

I legitimately have no clue where they are, and I don‚Äôt misuse my Zubsolv because ew, lol. 

So my friend whom I‚Äôve known since elementary school and was best friends with in middle and high school, uses heroin. She‚Äôs been using for about 4 1/2 years, but obviously when I was using she wasn‚Äôt a big priority because if someone‚Äôs using they‚Äôre using. You can‚Äôt just magically make them not use, so we rarely talked. 

Since I‚Äôve been sober for the past two months, I‚Äôve been talking to her more just to try to support her and really, to show her how nice it is to be sober. I‚Äôve been trying to support her, we hung out last week and I sparked her up on a blunt, that type of thing. So since I have no Zubsolv and I‚Äôm going to a concert with my mom this Saturday and I don‚Äôt want to be withdrawaling for it, I asked my girl, ‚ÄòI‚Äô, we‚Äôll call her, if she could give me a few of her Suboxone so I could make it. 

Well holy fucking shit. I‚Äôm not going to say it was like pulling teeth, but I had and have to essentially beg this bitch to let me get some. It‚Äôs not like she‚Äôs saying no and stuff, but it‚Äôs the type of thing where she‚Äôs asking me for money and shit for some. Thing that y‚Äôall should know is that *obviously* she doesn‚Äôt take them. Maybe one a week if she feels like it. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I know it‚Äôs my fault for misplacing mine, and I‚Äôm NOT trying to act as though I am *entitled to her medication*. But hopefully some of you guys understand where I‚Äôm coming from. So I just had to ask my dad for $5 so I can give it to her tomorrow for 2 fucking films. 

The reason why I‚Äôm like this is because A- Like I said she doesn‚Äôt even take them, and B- Last time we chilled I sparked her on a fat blunt and shit. Not to mention before I knew that she was prescribed Suboxone, I had offered her some of my Zubsolv if she ever needed. It‚Äôs like come fucking on... I 200% understand, know, and have experienced heroin addiction, y‚Äôall know that, I mean go look at my post history. But for fucks sake‚Äî something you don‚Äôt need nor take and you‚Äôre like holding onto it for dear life? I have to beg you for 2 fucking strips? Go fuck yourself. 

I always said that I would support her, considering when I was at her house she was going back and forth whether or not she wants to be sober, and I know she doesn‚Äôt. Plus again I know how it is. But it‚Äôs getting to the point where I can and WILL love you from an arm‚Äôs length. 

Idk, I just wanted to vent and get your guys‚Äô opinions. What do y‚Äôall think about the scenario??

EDIT: What IS a friend‚Äôs responsibility then guys?! Is ‚Äúmaking sure a friend is okay‚Äù not one?! Cause if not, I‚Äôve been being a friend ALLLL WRONG ",1547170076.0

aeoouw,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/aeoouw/nervous_about_upcoming_doctors_visit/,3,https://redd.it/aeoouw,PinkTalkingDead,Nervous about upcoming doctor's visit,"Hi all. I've lurked on this sub for a while but I've never posted. I apologize first off for the wall of text- I'm trying to convey the whole story succinctly. Just got off the phone with my Dr's office and felt the need to post here just to get something off my chest. In 2015 I tried heroin for the first time and within a few months I was a full blown addict. I got clean May 17, 2018, but for the first few months of being off drugs I fell into what a lot of addicts do, which is that I was drinking quite heavily for a bit there. I've always enjoyed drinking and have at least a glass a wine r 2 pretty much every evening, but I haven't been drinking as heavily at all as I was at the beginning of me being clean off dope (when I briefly was drinking in the mornings sometimes just to get that ritual of feeling inebriated like when I was using). Last week, I  went to the doctor for a physical for the first time in almost 8 years (longish story but no health insurance plus I'm relatively young) and they drew blood and did other tests. Well, the office just called and asked for me to come in again this Monday because the doctor was concerned with something having to do with my liver, and they told me not to drink any alcohol at all between now and my appointment. I'm so nervous,  y'all. My mom passed away when she was 45 to breast cancer and my father also died fairly young (50, he committed suicide) and I've always  been so fearful of the same fate. I've only recently started to get my life back together (got accepted to a really good college,  doing lots of self improvement things like yoga and reading and meditation and whatnot) and I really don't feel like I have anyone to turn to right now in my moment of insecurity and uncertainty. I just wanted to share that with this community and ask if anyone has similar stories or can offer any advice. Thank you guys",1547161081.0

I went for routine blood work long with my routine STD test. The nurse gets out her needle and was about to stick me and I'm watching her directly. She goes to hit me and right before she does, i tell her she's not going to hit my vein.   


she then gives me the dirtiest look and tries it anyway. Doesn't work. Tries again, doesn't work.   


I know that vein, I've wasted tons of shots on it, I'm a lefty, so i usually shoot in my right arm and thats exactly where she was trying to hit. I told her to try the other side and she hits it first time. As soon as she is finished i see her go run to her supervisor or whatever and kept looking back at me.

After being into drugs heavily at college, seizing after a Xan withdrawal, and being resigned to walking in circles and smoking weed all day every day in my parents' living room, never thought I'd feel truly euphoric again, it was over, flew too close to the sun. None of my IRL dealers were into the downer opiate scene much, nor would they enable me if they were. But finally my cavities and teeth caught up to my reckless treatment of them, neglecting to brush most days and  eating hella chocolate bars. Now usually when going to the dentist they'd fill in a cavity or three, with nothing more than novocain and sent me on my way, not even nitrous. However this time it was a cavity they'd already tried filling in and it got so close to the nerve that a root canal was warranted. And yup, eight 7.5/325s prescribed and a $200 bill. I knew my low-key scheme would eventually work! Couldn't stop myself from taking less than three per day, but was able to cut myself off after that. Those two days were so pleasant, and yeah I'm sure those of y'all with a tolerance must be pretty jealous I could get off on so little. But yeah, you know how it goes, now they're gone and I want more, so it's back to walking in circles and hitting the bong and eating chocolate bars and not brushing.

My habit wasn‚Äôt too bad this time, so WD‚Äôs weren‚Äôt gonna be anything out of this world. So a couple hours after doing my last dose, I wanted to get a good night sleep (as much as I could before sleep was hard to come by), so I decided to take half a leftover Seroquel I had from rehab. As I‚Äôm drifting off to sleep, I suddenly start feeling that creeping feeling of WD‚Äôs coming on. I think to myself ‚Äúdamn, that last shit I got must have been garbage with no legs,‚Äù but then it starts rising really rapidly, and before I know it, my body is literally ICE cold, I have the most intense feeling of dread and panic, burning in my chest, the whole fun shebang. That‚Äôs when it dawns on me... I suddenly remember my naltrexone pills looked exactly like my Seroquel pills. My heart literally sank, and I started panicking the fuck out. Ran to the bathroom and forced myself to throw up, hoping the entire pill hadn‚Äôt dissolved (it had). I kept asking myself how long is this feeling gonna last? What if it gets worse as more of the pill gets absorbed. I had never taken naltrexone before, and all I could think of at the time was how sub PWD‚Äôs can last days (I was too freaked out to remember that PWD‚Äôs from subs last really long from their long half-lives, and maybe PWD from naltrexone doesn‚Äôt last as long). It was fuuuuucking miserable and so scary. Doctor said don‚Äôt take it until 10 days after your last dose. I took it 2 hours after my last dose. Thank God, I‚Äôm feeling better this morning. 


What‚Äôs crazy is that I‚Äôm not feeling much WD‚Äôs at all this morning. Does taking naltrexone speed up your WD‚Äôs? Like you have them really intensely, but for a lot less time. Isn‚Äôt that how rapid detox works?

Just did some and passed oit over 10hrs + benzos +107mg methadone,"Soo had a meeting w my lawyer and my mathadone clinic counselor, was nervous bcni knew I was gonna get ""3 month trial probation"" and if I use heroin them it !eans jail which I love using.

I'm on a benzo taper down to 55mg diazepam a day, 20 mg AM, 15mg afternoon, 20mg PM.

But I said fuck it I'm nervous and gobbled down 40mg

So we talked they said the benzos were making me act weird, everyone has said that including my gfs just way way more talkative and interrupting people and talking to strangers about innaprop things like saying ""damn or ass"" which to my older gf she doesn't see respectful, it's not but I thought ""hey it's just me being me""

So anyways I didn't care my gfs got a check and I'm getting paid around $150 tmrw after work so we spent her whole $120 on H and bars, oh yeah a $10 eigth for her bc I hate weed it makes me paranoid.


Went to the dgirl! Paid $80 for my gram after using the test strip I know why people pay $100/g) she swears up and down I'm the only one she does $80/grams for, and I have to get a whole gram. For my bday she did .75/$60 but that was an exception,no $40 halves lol. 
+ 8 bars for $44 (she upped me from $5 to $5.5 bc her guy upped her, could have said $6 but she knows I'm cheap, also the 2mg kpins went from ,$4---->$4.50 oh well still a bargain for when she doesn't have any bars. She said someone just bought 20 bars for $8 a pop so ,$160 so looksmlike those 8 I might be able to get a few more but then again maybe not. These are some of the last remaining script non pressed bars and people pay 3/$20 for fake pressed ones on the street so $44/8 ain't so bad.

I also owed her $14 so paid off $10 of that

Plus my gf loves her weed she grows personally and does $10 8ths after talking her down from $15, I told her legal weed places one in particular sells $2/gram prerolls and $7/8ths, Even 8 & 9 dollar 8ths of you want smth diff but still less than ,$10. Grams of dabs with content varying from 70%-92% for ,$10 a gram, it's a 15min drive but for the dabs the local store that sells for $20 price matches me.

Anyways......


So anyways I took:

40mg diazepam in the AM
Took my 107mg methadone dose
Picked up 1.0 in really good H (she now has ""light which is gunpowder and dark which is that straight oily tar, both good the dark is where it's at though, still same price, I equate dark shots w potency so opt for the """"dark"" which I think is way stronger she prefers it too. )

Got fent test strips from Tracey and thought ""she told me a year ago someone she sells to did a fent test strip and got a positive, thought that was hype. But sure enough 1 line, positive for fentanyl. 

I casually take 1.5 bars so 3mg alprazolam waiting for her to get back we divided them 5 for me 3 for her bc she takes 1 and is out for the count, sleeping not ODing.

So I thought ""so what it must have always been positive for fent I'll do my regular .3 shot and gave my gf a .2"" 

The .2 knocked her out but she was talking and just slurring. She casually takes a bar after and while it's in her mouth I say ""remember this has fent take a half""

I did mine and usually am an intramuscular user, hence why I use a bit more. Well the stars aligned and I got a vein second try, burned a bit but no miss. 

Fuck I remember how itchy my rush was and gf said I slurred a few words then passed out she checked and said I was breathing so slow it was ""barely breathing"" scary for her. 

10h later w a half g left I might stretch that into 2, shots each vs 1 of us ODing. We have narcan but w the METHADONE OMG that would be a wd nightmare!!!!

Still just took 20mg diazepam like scripted could have skipped but didn't for some reason. 


BTW showed her in a text a pic w a positive fent result ""yeah I know I told you a year ago I know it has to have fent to be that strong! Not that much tho bc the legs are still there along w the tar effect (6 monoaceytal morphine hits you diff than straight east coast refined diamorphine) 

Short story:

Today I took:

40 mg Valium
107 mg methadone
3mg alprazolam
.3 shot of fent laced dope, IV which I usually can't find a vein and IM 
Woke up 10 hrs later 
Took 20mg diazepam as scripted not like anything else was but I thought I needed it, hell I wanted it but in a small dose. 


Getting a work check of about ,$150 dont wanna blow it on drugs, no wonder vs a. ,$80 teener her $80 gram kicks ass it's got fent in it, so please don't think bc it's tar your are immune to getting a bag that is contaminated w fent. 


On a lighter note my dad bought me some blue and white Retro 4 Jordans!!!! I love them he dropped them off while I wasn't home bc he had to get back home which is 50 miles south. Prob dropped $200 on them, they have been tried on twice fick they look brand new. Prob won't wear and keep in the box too nice I'll be afraid of getting dirty!!


Got you tied up like my Retro 4s - Kid Ink: No Strings ever since then I wanted a blue and white pair and he got me one even though they are damn near impossible to get!

I lurk here a lot and I just wanna say that I see you guys. I see your struggles, I see your pain, your resilience, your empathy. One thing I notice among addicts is that despite the stigma of being ""bad"" people who don't give a fuck about anyone else, a lot of you guys have a common denominator that makes you empathatic and actually, very loving people. I think it's pain. It's heartbreaking.

Those of you who struggle everyday, I wish you all love and peace. If you're trying to get clean, I'm rooting for you.

I don't know if this kind of stuff is something you guys welcome here but if it made one single persons day a little better even for just a second, I'm happy.

aege82,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/aege82/snowed_in/,3,https://redd.it/aege82,Waiting_on_a_Corner,Snowed In...,"Adin and I had moved in two weeks previous and the two bachelor apartment looked the part. Upstairs our two separate rooms were filled with boxes and mattresses from Craigslist. I  had won the game of Rock, Paper, Scissors and got the bigger room.

 Three big windows spread across  the wall facing the street, to the right was a wall with 2 sets of double closet doors that spanned the wall, to the vanity area. The vanity was a one person square, cabinets, a sink, mirror, and light bar opposite floor to ceiling shelves. The door to the toilet and an uncomfortable, cheap, bathtub and shower, faced one window on the wall. More scarred faces and unwanted surprises had alredy happened because of the rooms set up than I'm willing to admit. Adins room mirrored mine with the exception of his walk in closet and smaller windows, our beds in the corner same corners. With moving boxes for a nightstands and goodwill lamps as the only lights, our rooms reflected us individually.

With the old surf and skate pictures that I taped up on my walls and my longboards, I hung on to being the fun California bro, the old mask I worked hard to keep it in line. The rest of the room, devoid of anything but a red blanket and  a picture frame with 4 pictures stashed in it. The picture on top depicted my uncle and I at the beach in '08, walking down Pismo beach toward a distant peir. This was the part that reflected a me devoid of any hope, with a bit of love and full of memories I wished I could go back to.

The creature hiding behind the mask, pressing buttons and controls, taking care of mundane tasks, social and church obligations, making friends, being in the action, keept my secrets deep within it's veins. Any sane person would want free of this mask and the parasite within, changing you bit by bit. Instead I  embraced the mask, it took care of everything and I lived in stoned bliss. 
---------------------

The rest of the apartment had blank beige walls, a small sparse kitchen furnished mostly by my grandmother. I  was the first grandchild for her, and I took advantage of the generosity quickly whenever the apartment needed something.

The one thing we did have plenty of was sofas. My mother had been on Facebook finding every free couch avaliable for us. We picked up 3 at once one night, one for smoking weed out on the porch, two had good views of the loaned projector on the family room wall. Eventually there were two more where the dining nook should have been, for those who had partied into unconsciousness. 

The three defining characteristics of our apartment were the sofas, the shopping cart, and the giant, industrial, wooden spool that served as a coffee table. The empty spool had been in the appartment when I came home from work, apparently Adins brother had found it? But who cared? It was pretty cool and weed crumbs could always be found in the cracks.

The shopping cart was another matter though... On our first night Adin suggested we get sofa trays from the  Bed Bath and Beyond in the shopping center behind our row of apartments. He convinced me saying he'd get a grape Game at the Food Lion. We dicked around like only newly free 20 year old boys could but left with two tables and a towel for Adin. We raced carts outside as soon as the words ""first one home wins"" came out I knew I had made a mistake. Adin stole meaningless shit for fun, and started bolting home cart and all. I yelled but it was to no effect, he had his mind set, and I cut through the woods home. I had started rolling the Grape Game into a blunt when Adin burst in the loose door, shopping cart first. We fought briefly but in the end, it collected junk, and a peace blunt was smoked on the porch.
-------------------------- 

It was Monday, we should have been at work, slaving and sabotaging away. Instead we both sat on the porch wrapped in robes and blankets, passing a blue double bubbler back and forth. As the world around me became picturesque like Planet Earth, I relaxed and let it take me for a moment. Over the weekend the earth had blessed and cursed all the Triangle, the first snowstorm of the year was heavy, wet and cold. It snowed, melted, and froze everything to a sheet of ice. For Travis our employer this was a problem because work couldn't be done, for us it was heaven because we had heat, an Xbox and weed. After a half hour out in the cold, smoking every remnant of weed and resin Adin squints at me and says he's hungry. I suggest Starbucks and he suggests bagels and so our quest begins.

Starbucks never closes so we decide to go there first, the place was packed. Suits, determined to get to the office, beside moms, just trying to get some caffeine until it's an acceptable time to drink mommies special ""juice"", and teenage girls. The normal crowd for the day, with two flies in the ink. Adin and I, Adin couldn't get his eye drops in so his eyes looked like tomatoes. In addition to this he was wearing a very fashionable pair of footy pajamas that made him look like a penguin and his robe over that. I wasn't doing much better though I had on dark blue joggers that weren't mine, my favorite light blue Scary Kids Scaring Kids t-shirt. Complete with a T-Rex and robot wolves fighting on it, a wool Mister Rogers sweater and a blanket I had methodically folded into a thick scarf, made me looking homeless. We looked stoned and smelled the part too, moms quietly hushed their children about us. Some kids even manage to point before they are scolded. 'I don't care what anybody thinks' is the thought that fules me as I stand at my full 6'1"". 

A cop standing at attention in the corner  catches my eye briefly, as I surveyed the room. I keep him in my peripheral vision as we order two large, and complicated bean waters. Eventually he shrugged and went back to his phone, confidence really is the key, I suppose. As we get our coffees Adin turns around, a petrified look plastered on his face. ""Dude there's a cop right there, let's get the fuck out of here"" he says, heading quickly for the door. I simply smirk and follow Adin out, clutching our coffees for warmth, we cut across the frozen parking lots toward Brugers.

Brugers was also packed with people, no cops though. I'm a Californian through and through, where Brugers doesn't exist, so I am lost in the menu and procedure. Adin orders for both of us, as I stumble about with my wallet open. I hand my card to the cashier with shaky hands, I am not confidant in this place. But we leave with three bagels and one salmon bagel sandwich thing I had managed to order. The trek back home was a delicate dance of avoiding ice and holding hot coffee. We made it home in one peice along with our breakfasts. As we wolfed down the amazing food, I told Adin over and over how amazing my sandwich was.

After breakfast came our first hot box of the closet under the stairs. We designated this the official house hot box room as it was under the stairs, it barely fit two people, and it was in the bathroom with a fan downstairs. After our hot box session we emerged ready to take on the onslaught of online multiplayer Call Of Duty.
--------------------------

Most of Monday and Tuesday were lost to this cycle of drugs, video games, and sleep. When Wednesday came around it was obvious that we would be working on Thursday, snow was piled on the shady side of the roads but the roads themselves were 85% clear. Like the ice our vacation was coming to an end. A last hurrah was our signature move and so we threw a party that night. Lucas and Mira made the drive, to our humble escape. Lucas had used the snow as an excuse to stay with Mira for a few days, against his parents will. I had picked up Brooke yesterday, and she had an excuse to stay the night. Val was the last addition to the party having trugged through the snow for two and a half to make it to our place. Adin supplied her with dry clothes, while we debated the best way to mix Everclear. 

One part Everclear for every 2 parts lemonade, this was the concoction we all agreed on for the night. We began a game of Red, Purple, Black, a terrible game of probabilities, none of which were in your favor. Within thirty minutes I was already ""the floor is my home now"" drunk, Adin and Brooke got me upstairs with some struggle.

After what felt like a couple hours and a loud drunk sex session, I emerge soberish and unashamed back to the party. As soon as Adin saw me he exclaimed ""He Lives!"", I take a small bow as Adin hands me half a blunt. Lucas and Mira had taken my usual couch seat, so I sat on the floor. Brooke wound around me, love and warmth radiate between us. Between pulls from the blunt we passed our only controller around the room, every time we died. 'Is this what the 90's were like? Trading controllers, only one screen on, just friends hanging out'. I archive this thought to ponder later while much higher, as I return to the conversation. Adin is watching Lucas play Call of Duty, talking loadouts. Brooke, Mira and Val are talking about something they saw on Facebook or Reddit. I settle into the rythym of the night, smoking, videogames, chiming in to conversation. 'Ahhhh...' This is well worth every day I've let slip away unpaid.

Inevitably Thursday will come and I will have to return to pretending to be an adult. Until then I will remain in this moment.

Two of the days I took the pills I also hit one or two small dabs after swallowing them.

I am here for my opiate/heroin addiction that has had its ups and downs in my life since 2008, disappearing after therapy or medically assisted treatment only to rear its ugly head back into my life always at different times and sometimes at the worst of times. 												
Ive been dealing with a pretty bad relapse really since Dec 2017. It started creeping in Sept 2017 and by April of 2018 all I could think of was getting high . Granted sometimes I would supplement with Kratom to not use every single day but I did use say 5 days out of the week. The year then included me overdosing, being found naked and dead by my partner (now ex) who dressed me and called 911. They administered narcan multiple times until I had to have it IV in the ambulance where I came to. I then kept using, went to rehab, was clean for 4 months, fell in love at rehab, we ended up using together. I started using needles, I got compulsive and didn‚Äôt want to stop. My family sent me here.	 
I have 5 days left here at this beautiful house that was started by an older Canadian lady who is now deceased and left the place to a group of 4 Mexican hippie kids who work in the health care field , emt tech, nurse, and a couple other people that work here. She met these kids while down here trying to start an Ibogaine clinic. They shared her love of pot smoking and the healing power of plant medicine and psychedelics. This place has treated people from celebrities to humbolt pot growers, to people from all over the US and Europe. This place is good vibes for sure. 	

I have been here for a week now. Just starting to feel better. My Ibogaine treatment happened Thursday night so it has been 5 days without any opiates. I woke up from my trance with no withdrawal symptoms despite it having been 24 hours since my last dose of morphine. However, I threw up a couple times the next morning and while throwing up I went into full on withdrawal mode, sweat from every pore of my body, shaking, chills, muscle spasms, but as soon as the puking ended I was back to feeling fine. This happened both times. I had also fasted since noon Thursday so I had nothing in my stomach but water. 								
Later in the day I felt the Ibogaine completely wear off and I felt some slight withdrawal symptoms at night like restless legs and watery eyes, enough to keep me from sleeping. I haven‚Äôt been able to sleep much since then without muscle relaxers, clonidine and benzos that I shamelessly look from the office not knowing they would give me some if I had only asked, which i did last night and the night before. I also found some Imodium the first night after Ibogaine and took a bunch of that in a desperate attempt to stop my restless jerking legs. 	
Hopefully tonight I can finally sleep with maybe just melatonin and Tylenol . I‚Äôm still having lingering withdrawal symptoms like random pains and sneezing. Someone here said that those are also lingering effects of the Ibogaine but I don‚Äôt know how much I buy that. But today I finally took a shower without being forced to and went out on errands with the care takers here. They kept trying to get me to come out of my room last few days and I was just not feeling it lol. Finally feeling like myself and with my cravings being way less than they usually are when I typically quit. So I would say today is a good day. Got some drawing supplies to keep me busy and finally listening to music again. Just wanted to share my experience since I know many of us have wondered about Ibogaine for a while.

TLDR at bottom.


  This was a huge problem for me a few years back when I was trying to hide my almost daily usage from my girlfriend. She doesn't use drugs but is very hip with what the  behaviors are and the fact that if my pupils were pinned then then was high. So I was always getting busted. 

So I did a bunch of research found out that the drug that the eye doctor uses to dilate your pupils can also be found OTC at any pharmacy sold as nose drops. 

It's called phenylephrine. It is sold as an alternative to Sudafed and it is the same exact thing and eye doctor uses to dilate your pupils. 

No I wouldn't recommend using it in your eyes daily because I'm not sure that it's used in that fashion medically. However, I have been been using it about once or twice a week off and on for 5 years and my most recent eye doctor visit showed my eyes were perfectly fine minus my slight nearsightedness that hasn't changed in years. 

3 drops in each eye does the trick FOR ME. 40 minutes later my pupils look normal. Careful not to over do it or you look like you're tripping balls. 

TL:DR I was tired of being called out for using because of my pinned pupils. So I did some research and found out the chemical PHENYLEPHRINE which the eye doctor uses to dialate your pupils can be bought OTC. It's sold as  store brand nose drops. 3 drops in each eye does the trick for me YMMV. 

But don't take my word for it...consult your physician....or..........Wikipedia.

I'm writing a short film about my experiences with the girl who I was   deeply in love with who was a heroin addict. We're not together anymore,   for obvious reasons, but it has helped me to process it by writing a   short film about it.

I plan to shoot the   film in March. I, myself, am not a drug user and I never saw her use   until the end (boy, what a fight that was -- I should say: I don't have   problems with drug use unless it's a problem for someone and it was   definitely a problem for her, she wasn't happy, it was ruining her life, and that's when it becomes an issue. Until then, as-salamu alaykum.)

But   for the film, I think it's important that the woman be more of the  main  character than the man, and I think it's important to show aspects  of  her using. I don't want to get it wrong though, and every time I  google  ""how to cook heroin"", all I get is drug abuse help sites. I've  tried to  google this a hundred different ways and can't find anything  that just  says how to do it.

So... how  do you  ""cook"" heroin? I know the process is just liquefying heroin so  it can be  injected, is it literally that simple? A la: put powder  heroin in a  spoon, heat spoon, powder becomes liquid? Or is there more  to it?

FUCK FETTY WAP!


Anyway. Baltimore fent warning. Name of caps is ""Power"".... Southwest side of the city. Shit is better than the Lex Luger caps that seem to be sold at this same spot half the time. I'd say about double the potency of lex Luger. Lex Luger is fentanyl too (I've never done real *HEROIN* + quanine scramble. Done enough raw to kill and elephant but I've never actually seen scramble with actual raw dope in it, it's always fent now). It's like they switch back and forth from power to lex Luger all day everyday at this spot. $6 caps. I feel like all of this Info is enough for you to know if you cop in the city at this spot that you know exactly where Im talking about.


Second spot I can't say the name of the street so I don't know how to explain to you guys without sourcing. No name caps. They are $4-$5 each. These caps are WAY STRONGER than Power. Like, I straight DIED off a key bump of these caps.. like 3-4 times? I cant remember  I've overdosed more than 10 times (like  numerous doses of narcan needed - overdoses) I can shoot half of sometimes even an entire cap of the Power caps so that should tell you just how powerful these caps are.

This spot is still SW Baltimore. Not too far from the B&O railroad muesaem. (Idk how to spell museam? Mueseam? Lol). WAY less known than the spot that sells power.

Everyone from the upper middle class to the lower classes living in poverty. With poverty being subsidized in America, no matter how much they try to deny it, these classes are essentially the same. The only difference is perceived wealth, material possessions and the massive amount of debt they incur trying to get there. All but the top percentile will ever really own thier properties, homes and vehicles. Whether we'd like to acknowledge that we truly are slaves (It's a heavy burden to bear) it's still there in the back of our minds, we know there is little hope to break free from this system. That leads to a universal need, the need to escape our manufactured realities in whatever means deemed nessecary. Many people use drugs to escape, once an efficient and viable tool, becomes a burden of its own. The question is whats next? How do we cope knowing what we know to be undeniable truth looming like death, I feel an utter sense of doom for our society and the human race as a whole. 

We were created as a slave race, with the thoughts of our creators dancing in our heads. Free will wasn't given to us, it was a mistake in the bio-engineering process, a trait of future versions of self aware, post-prototype humans. (Before you think im completely crazy, look it up) At least 3 distinct species of man popped up and co-existed to varying degrees at once. To this day we can't find a common ancestor, not that evolution doesn't exist, because it clearly does. The distant link to chimps is easily explained, our creators blended the DNA of native primates with thier own, creating an alien hybrid slightly more adapted to terrestrial life than themselves. Strong, hardworking and stupid. The perfect slaves. 

If we were created as slaves why do some of us have such a hard time dealing with it? I've come to realize, I'm getting too old to fight it anymore. Eventually we all come to submit, something I couldn't quite understand in my youth. Those of us who are more intelligent than the people we work for (I'm pretty sure being an asshole is a key factor in winning a dead end management position.)  Tire of taking orders quickly, a curious trait for a slave. 

The thing is, in America we are downtrodden just enough to be resentful, yet not enough for full on rebellion. Which brings me back to the subsidation of poverty. Do you honestly believe in the SNAP/Foodstamp program as an act of compassion? Hardly, starving slaves revolt 100% of the time. Subsidizing poverty keeps politicians from being murdered in the streets. (for the most part) The middle class hates this because they think they are paying for it when in reality they are paying the salaries of our overlords, our law makers, who are pulling in 6 figure incomes off the backs of hard working Americans. We must realize, we are in this together, it's us against them and it will always be that way. ",1547067437.0

Maybe I'll start a vlog/IG of traveling California eating California burritos everywhere detailing the burrito but also catch some street art and skylines and shit.

Got myself some sour gummy belts w/ 300 mg of THC plus a gram of mid shelf sativa and a g of ""mid-shelf"" (still ridiculously fire bud at most likely 14%-19%), all for $24.

I got into work a good 10 mins late bc I took a few wrong turns haha.

At work I basically do nothing and then once an hour on the half hour climb in a floating blimp, record multiple digital/analog readings such as Barometric pressure, helium pressure, and Outside Air Temperature plus Super Heat Temperature. Right after I got to work I had the munchies so I ate all 300 mg of them pretty much without thinking about it cuz they taste so good lol. Got pretty baked drank a couple cups of strong coffee and also just did my pre daytime sleep shot.

Also it is possible to do Heroin once, or do it on an occasional basis, it has happened before. I find it very weird that people block this out as a possibility and make it seem like everyone that has ever done opiates has become addicted to them. Just my 2 cents, go easy on me.",1547031763.0

ae0r69,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/ae0r69/a_home/,7,https://redd.it/ae0r69,Waiting_on_a_Corner,A Home.,"""Well I'm from California I moved here about 6 months ago in January"" I said clearly. I sat upright with my chest puffed to seem confidant in the small entry area of The Best Pest Control. Travis the owner sat across from me in his office chair asking me questions on my background as part of my interview to be a ""The Best Pest Control Technician"". I already knew I had the position, small mom and pop business like this need to replace someone fast when they leave otherwise work backs up and they go under. But I had another advantage, I was raised Mormon and went to church most sundays. Travis was a good Mormon father and hired the office manager Tayler from his old congregation. The Mormon connection, as cheesy as it is, came through for me. After Travis decided I must be a good person, I am a Mormon after all, we shook hands and I started Monday.


This was how I came to meet and live with Adin. Adin was the office assistant, he did anything he was told by Travis and Taylor. I had seen him at church a couple times, clean cut, well styled hair, he looked like a good young man. Though looks were deceiving Adin enjoyed getting high, partying, and drinking, he wore the mask. His secret reflected mine, I also dabbled in debauchery. I had been a regular at the Bullpin, pounding four dollar pints of Red Oak between turns playing pool with Jacob and Lucas, every Thursday for 4 months now. Most Saturdays when I told my parents that I was out with my Mormon friends I was at parties. I had friends at work from the ""ghetto"" city next to ours where I stuck out from everyone with my California style. Flip flops, jeans, a tank top, and perfectly styled hair, that was my statement every summer night since I had moved. But in the ""ghetto"" crowd I was the only white guy at parties, drinking Reds, and finding the stoners and druggies. Hoping to trade decent beer for a hit or two of whatever they had. I tested Adin casually by mentioning getting drunk and stoned at a party. He wasn't fazed, and spoke about getting stoned out of earshot of everyone else. Soon Adin, Lucas, and I were all partying.

This was exactly the opposite of the intentions I had when I first landed across the nation from all my old problems. I moved here with a tentative verbal agreement with my parents. The agreement was I got to live there for one year, paying 200 dollars a month, if I stayed clean of drugs and went to church every Sunday. As simple as that. I was already past every minute withdrawal from the alcohol and smoking an ounce a week, when I stepped off the plane. So why was I on the roof of a beer garden downtown ""sobering up"" with Lucas? I pondered this briefly, staring at a vile wheat IPA Lucas picked that sat in front of me. Lucas had bummed a single cigarette from some girls on the street, lifting it from him was a bit of a dick move, 'eh,we're best friends'. Lucas was droning on about how drunk he was, trying to think of how to get us back to his parents. He scheemed as I lit the cigarette and pulled in a lungfull of tar, nicotine, and sweet MAOI's. Mmmmmmmm...... That's why people do this, I hit it again and handed it to him. He accepts it, not even noticing I stole it, I shrug and chug down half of my disgusting drink. 

""Fuck, we're fucked"" Lucas exhaled.

""Dude I was already fucked, I have to move in a month"" I said monotone and hopeless. ""My parents said I could stay till January, then I'm on my own for good"" I pounded the last of the beer and took the cigarette back.

Lucas looked at me shocked I hadn't mentioned this to him earlier. Though quickly his face changed to mischief. Mischief and fun were what Lucas was best at, always pushing shots, double strength drinks, always trying to make every night amazing. Slowly he took back the last of the cigarette and said ""You know Adin has been looking to move out, plus he's the office manager now...""


On Saturday Adin wanted some weed and I had a dealer, from my Algebra 102 class. Allen was chill, he sold weed so he and his girlfriend could smoke for free and that's all he wanted. He was nice and even had Brooke and I over for a movie night once. He wasn't looking for new clients but we were algebra friends, so I bought Adin along. We bought a quarter and they seemed to get along. It was a smooth transaction, in the car Adin packed his orange spoon and I divided the bag. We smoked on our way to take Adin back to his dad's truck. Adin looked at me as we turned on to the freeway ""we should be roommates"" he said. I laughed as I hit the bowl steering with my knee ""sure"" I said. It started as a stoned joke but after one mostly sober talk, 2 apartment visits, and some paperwork, Adin and I were roommates. 

We uses his dad's truck to get beds and move our four boxes of stuff. My mom found us four couches on Facebook and lamps came from Goodwill. It was bare bones bachelor living. Travis loaned us his projector and we proped it up on my longboard, it was gigantic on the wall. Adin supplied an XBOX and my grandma stocked our kitchen with cups and plates. We had heat, light, beds, and drugs. Lucas and his girlfriend set up the Wi-Fi while we were gone,  electromagnetic radiation broadcast out ""BrosB4Hoes"" from the living room, classy... 

We loved it, we had total freedom and we used it liberally. We threw a Spartan party the very first night we were there, Everclear lemonade flowed and weed smoke bellowed from the back porch with a loveseat on it. What would become my core group of friends sat there playing Red, Purple, Black. To my left was Lucas and his loving girlfriend Mira, as Kelsey. I had known Kelsey for a long time through church, and Brooke liked her. Adin and his new office assistant Val sat across from me, and leaning on me was my girlfriend Brooke. We laughed, got very drunk, and had a blast. In the end Val and Adin slept in his room and Brooke and I went in mine. From then on everyone came over just to blow off steam, it was a home and haven for us and our friends. We never had a dull night in our house.

 Brooke was 18 she was young and impressionable but, she had a will of iron and made things happen. I needed this because I had never had such adult responsibilities and was intimidated. That was not why we were together though., she cast a beautiful spell 
over me, we loved each other intensely, we had fought for it and won, we were invincible. I drowned into her beauty, 5'4"", Blonde shoulderblade length hair curled framing her fair round face, sea blue eyes, perfect Nordic beauty. An hour later she lay on my chest, I always synchronized my breathing to hers. She melted into blissfull sleep, carefully I reached to my right and hoped I had a roach on the table. My fingers found a
 crutch, paydirt, I put it in my mouth with my right hand and the grab a lighter. I look at it, about a centimeter of weed is visible.

'good enough'

I lit it expertly while stroking Brookes back to keep her asleep. Three hits later I taste paper and I chrush out the crutch on the nightstand. Rolling to the left I faced Brooke our legs intertwine. I tried to study her face, memorizing every curve and dimple. For the last week whenever I closed my eyes for bed I saw a silhouette of a girl. I had wracked my brain time and again but nobody I knew could match the silhouette, and it most definitely wasn't Brooke. I close my eyes and there she was again like the ghost of Christmas future. She sat staring at me, waiting for the minutes on her lilac mermaid timer to reach zero. I am paralyzed as the figure walks to me, she slowly strokes my face, ""turn before the cannons"" she whispered and smirked.

I was released as my eyes snapped open to the same curves I was memorizing were staring back at my shocked face. I gingerly got out of bed sweating and went to the very top shelf in the bathroom, quietly I pulled out a small bag of Xanax bars and broke half off. Expertly put the rest back, not hidden, just placed where Brooke couldn't see. I slid back to Brookes side and curled up to her.

 I don't remember closing my eyes again that night.",1546992281.0

Long story included.,"Ive been going to the same sub doctor for almost years now.  They are super cool as well as nice and genuinely care about the patients. Not only that but they only hire recovering addicts who have 2+ years clean. For over a year throughout my fiances pregnancy I stayed totally clean except for smoking a bit of bud. 

i had made the decision to quit my serving job at dennys and go back to car sales(which I consider my career and also love), but any of you who have ever been in car sales knows its drug infested. I did awesone for about 6 months. Kept to myself, had a daily routine of morning meditation, working out, and planning my day. 

Then we got a new salesman. He was around my age, had a false sense of self confidence and was great at talking to customers. His whole demeanor screamed adderall. This fucked came in and outsold me the first month. God my pride and my ego was destroyed. Here I am sober and on top of my game and Mr.Douche just comes in and takes over.

So I start to get a little bit closer to him and kind of hint about drug use and he pulls out this zip lock bag filled to the top with yellow schoolbusses(Xanax 2mg) and the pink circular pills(adderall, I forget what mg 30 I think?). Before I could even say no he had pulled a few of each out and handed them to me and down the hatch some went, and so the relapse began.

For a while it was great. Gave 0 fucks what I said to customers, had no filter, seemed to always say what they wanted to hear, and master manipulation which is what car sales is about for most people. I was unstoppable. Selling one a day at least which in this business would net you 8-10k a month at the right dealership. I was putting money back and life was good at the time.

Then came my downfall. One day out nowhere I scrolled through my contacts and ran across the all familiar (John R) in my phone. Which is what my dboy was always saved under. I clicked on his name, typed out that ever so familiar text ""you good?"" and stared at it for about a minute. Sent... Now I feel like its important to mention here my complete lack of self control when it comes to H. I cannot conserve, I can't say no, I can't limit myself, and I don't know when to quit.

Within a month I went from salesman of the month to salesman of the bathroom 4-5 times throughout the day. I stopped my healthy morning routines and replaced them with morning shots. I stopped caring about my appearance. I stopped coming home with flowers, steak dinners and presents for my baby girl and started coming home with 8 balls, tv dinners, and track marks.

Life quickly fell apart again. This has all happened several times before. Seems to be a routine for me. It falls apart quicker and quicker each time. I blew through my savings in 2 months, had a gram + a day habit and a terrible attitude and depression that carried on from the moment I opened my eyes in the morning to the time I closed them at night.

I had previously worked my way up to monthly take homes at my doctor which was awesome so I only had to clean up for about 3 days a month to clean my system out for my appt and drug test. Well I pissed dirty and the look on my docs face when I walked into his office and he looked at my results. It was almost like a father being disappointed in a son. I lost my monthly and got brought back down to weekly. I lost their respect and also their trust.

That brings me to today. 5 months later. I lost my job, my car blew up on me, I am broke most of the time, ive got a crippling daily habit, and life is just all around shit right now. I am about to go piss dirty again for like the 20th time in a row. I'm surprised they still let me come but they haven't given up on me yet. Not to mention that its an all day affair because I have to take 3 different busses, an uber, and be at the doc for about 3 hours. Then make the trip back home.

Sorry for the long post. I just wanted to give you all something to read for those of you who are bored or like reading stories about people failing in life lol.

My mother had died after being ill for a long time, leaving behind an abundance of untouched morphine and oxycodone (not to mention a grieving wreck of a daughter). 

Early Monday morning I underwent invasive surgery (double jaw + 3 wisdom teeth removed) which left me in profuse pain. I‚Äôve since been loaded up on oxycodone, tramadol, and morphine. I assumed my tolerance would be back to nothing by now but that is not the case. I‚Äôve needed an obscene amount just to touch the pain, to the point where my doctor said most people would be well and truly unconscious on the amount I was given. 

At first the pain was too overbearing to even notice the effects of the drugs, but now it‚Äôs under control and I can really appreciate the high. I‚Äôve been in such a good mood all day despite the ordeal I just went through- chatting and laughing with the nurses (I‚Äôm usually an anxious introverted worry wart) and having great dialogue with my family and friends. The one and only downside is that my face is itching like mad but I can‚Äôt gain relief from scratching due to numbness. It‚Äôs a lot more infuriating than it sounds. 

I‚Äôm heading home in the morning and they won‚Äôt be discharging me with any opiates, unless you count panadeine forte (lol). 
It was fun while it lasted I guess. I don‚Äôt have the money or resources to continue with opiates anymore, nor the desire for my life to head back in that direction. But god was this a reminder of what I lost when I quit them. The pull is strong. 

Stay safe everyone.

Probably a shit post. Apologies in advance.,"I'm coming up on 2 years since I last used. I've been on methadone (tried subs and just wasn't for me) during that time and stabilized at a pretty high dose and have been titrating down since. I'm around 50mg now.

Normally I'm the one on this sub cheering everyone on in their recovery and telling them how great they're doing and that the bad times will pass and just hang in there. But, I can't seem to convince myself of that.

A couple of months ago I had to get blood drawn for some tests and I think that triggered my needle fixation in my brain because ever since then I can't stop thinking about using. I dream about it every single night and nothing feels right anymore. I tried for 2 years to get my life back to 'normal' but the sad truth is it will never go back since I, like many of you, only ever felt normal when I was using.

I know it's stupid, I know the chances are slim to none, I know exactly what I would tell someone else if they were asking this question, but has anyone ever planned out a short relapse and then continued on in their recovery?

I just want some relief from this clich√© monkey on my back. I was thinking of using for a week and then hopping back on the wagon. It would fuck up my reputation with my doc and I would lose a take-home or two but I just don't know how else to shake this feeling. I miss the sweet nothingness so much. I miss the magic numbing of emotional pain so much. Fentanyl was my best friend for so long and heroin was a pretty decent runner up. Anyway. Watchy'all think? Pretty fucking stupid, right? Or has anyone managed this successfully before?

&#x200B;

I remember the first time I smoked weed on opiates I had some codeine phosphate 60mg and went to a KFC drivethrough to get a boneless banquet and took 300mg as I was waiting. I rolled a phat 1g blunt while waiting aswell. So when I get home I feel it somewhat but I have never gotten why people loved the effects of opiates with some use in the past. Then I smoke this joint and very quickly it seems to intensify the codeine 10 fold and vice versa. Then I get upstairs put some trippy music on and am am scared to close my eyes because my breathing feels manual and I dont wanna just die right there and then because I read people stop breathing on overdoses because well theyre overdosing. I eventually give in and shut my eyes and am amazed by the pshychedlic closed eye visuals but at this point I am nodding to the max. Honestly opiates are no fun without weed for me. After that experience that combo was the only thing I could think about for a month till I did it again, like I dont know why I waited so long for something that felt so good. Anyone else feel same or just me

I've been on 200-300mg of oxy a day for the past couple months or so. The plan is to finish what I have tonight, tomorrow I'll begin trying to find some comfort in the few different strains of Kratom I've picked up, small doses of loperamide, muscle relaxers (Flexeril) if I need it and Xanax (for sleep), plus the usual household medicines. Then when I wake up the following day on Wednesday I'll assess how I am and potentially wait till a little later in the morning/early afternoon before I begin trying to induct onto Suboxone with small doses first, to hopefully avoid precipitated withdrawal. And from there I'll try to keep my use of subs to 10 days or so to avoid dependency on it and try to rapidly taper off them, and use Kratom for any issues coming off it.

The worst part is sitting here feeling completely fine, knowing what I'll be feeling tomorrow is anything but. I can just only hope my plan will work decently and make it a lot more comfortable.

tonight we came through to get my bf a point (im having to go on suboxone for a few days because we cant afford to keep both of us well) and this motherfucker wouldn‚Äôt even look at us. he took the 20, weighed out the piece, handed it back, and wouldn‚Äôt answer any of our ‚Äúhow are you?‚Äù ‚Äúhow‚Äôs the new puppy?‚Äù type questions. didn‚Äôt say bye back to us or anything. oh, also he has FOUR new Louis Vuitton collars for his new dog and multiple gucci boxes everywhere. but he can‚Äôt pay us back? his loyal customers who fund his fucking lifestyle?

I started crying and screaming in the car ride home, thinking about how this dude has my fucking macbook and iphone that i traded him for heroin but he can‚Äôt even have the decency to look us in the eye and talk to us. we spend every dollar we earn to fund his fucking lifestyle, and he acts like he can‚Äôt give up designer brand shit to throw us a small piece that we worked for. 

it just made me feel like shit. this dude has truly controlled our lives for the past half year, and he loves it. he‚Äôs drunk on the power. he convinced us that we were his best friends so he could keep our business but also take advantage of us. im fucking sick of it. im never giving him my fucking money again. ill wait hours for my other guys to reup before giving this piece of shit another dollar.

Ive only done it with 3 of those 5. 1 is a guy that turned me on to it, 2 is a chick that ive known for more than 10 years and was pretty fucking close. The 3rd is a girl i didnt know done it but found out from my long time chick friend because they was friends and she spilled the beans to me lol. Well all up until about a week ago, ive helped my long time chick friend out ALOT with many late talks about us hating who we have become and how we spent christmas together because noone else wanted us there. 
     So about a week ago she calls me crying her eyes out telling me how she fucked up so bad and got caught doing some thing sooooo fucked up. She talks about how she is never going to use Again. So i say well starting tomorrow im rigbt there with ya. We we will help each other. I would start today with you but you called as im pulling off from our guy lol. So tells me awesome okay we can do this. I tell her i know we can. 
     So next day comes around and I tried to call her and text her and I get no reply. I start freaking out. I was beginning to think she done killed herself because she was so upset do day before about what she had done. Second day goes around still no answer. And I start beginning to think what the fuck. Third day goes around still nothing, fourth day still nothing, 5th day still nothing, and today being the 6th day, she finally messaged back and says I can't be in contact with you because you have caved twice in the past six days where I haven't. I can't talk to you no more because you talked to them still and you still use.
     She begins telling me all this other different stuff about how she can be associated with me no more. And that she can't talk to me and this and that. And that hurts me. Because I love this girl so much. She means the world to me as a friend and if it were to be more than that that would make my day. Hell that would make my life to be honest. She literally broke my heart by telling me that. Because when she wasn't texting back I needed someone, anyone at all just to talk to but she was one of the last people to actually still be my friend. Because when I came out and told everyone I was in heroin addict trying to get help, I lost everyone. Everyone ran. No one talk to me anymore. Like I was some type of disease that they couldn't be in contact with. Now I'm kind of lost for words and don't know what to do considering the last person that never judge me and that was always there for me when she wasn't busy with our kid or family she was there...

I've been shooting ecp for the past month, almost every day, and each time I get high, around 3 hours after I shoot, I vomit. Sometimes I'll vomit right after I dose, but that's only when I snort it. Weird as fuck right? 

And I'm not talking about a little puke, I'm taking full on projectile vomiting over and over, then being okay for another hour or so. I've never had this happen before. I've shot fentanyl before consistently and never had this problem. I've been doing oxycodone for years and have only puked when I mixed it with hydros, Xanax, and Ativan all at once.

But lately, each time I get high, no matter if it's just dope, a speedball, a goofball, or snorted, I vomit a few hours after dosing. I know it's more common to vomit right after you push the plunger, but I'm fine then. I also know it's more common to puke when you're opiate naive, but I am definitely not.

I've been on H for most of my adult life. Basically straight out of high school my weed plug decided one day that he wanted to be an H plug and gave me a sample with my sack and the rest is history. Blue grass grows where I'm from(hope that's not against rules let me know). So ECP is my DOC. 

My habit exceeds my financial situation so everyday is a struggle to get right. I rotate between my suboxone script and banging way to much dope in a day. Zero self control, can't seem to ever conserve. Dont get me started on my girl. She's diabetic so rigs are always on deck but her eyesite is fucked so I have to hit her every time.

The government certainly isn't. There is a reason these drugs are illegal, and it's because people can't be trusted with them. We are a danger to ourselves, and possibly those around us if you're the reckless type.  
  
Don't get me wrong, I understand where you are coming from. This absolutely shouldn't be a criminal matter, but sometimes tough love has it's place.  
  
What the United States, and for that matter, the world, is experiencing, is a Health Crisis, and it should be treated as such.  
  
I offer you sincere honesty, and transparency. Try to look at things from another perspective. Instead of a drug addict feeling victimized, look from the eyes of your victims, your families that care about you. Look at it from the eyes of the parents finding their children, their babies, their sons and daughters, laying dead on the floor. Children, living with parents that neglect, steal from, and abuse them.  
  
Imagine the parents are the government our country has voted into a position of power, with the help of medical professionals, and people that care about harm reduction at their dispense.  
  
I'm speaking of an ideal situation, but humans aren't perfect. We trip, we fall. Lord knows we fuck up.   
  
But I have faith, that one day, we're going to get it right. There are people in our community striving to enact change. To make a difference in this world, but it can be overwhelming. They can't do it alone. They need your help.   
  
I challenge each and every one of you to tell me why I am wrong for this opinion. The fact is, most of Reddit looks at this community as a bunch of filthy drug addicts. To them, you're a bunch of thieving scumbags. We are a minority. But maybe, just maybe if they came here and saw more people trying to make a difference. Than maybe we can slightly shift that opinion.  
  
I would like to have an educated discussion about this. Some of you are incredibly intelligent.   
  
I also fully expect some of you are going to resort to name calling and imply that I'm a filthy communist and a puppet installed by our fascist government. And that's OK. You're entitled to that opinion. You're just wrong

Pulled through cotton it is very translucent (instead of being cloudy). It very likely had fentanyl cut into it, based on what I've read and the apparent strength, but it also definitely had heroin as well, based on the smell (and appearance). (I've noticed smell is the best indicator. It's hard to smell small amounts, like my 4 stamps for $20 that would normally be 25 bucks, but as soon as it hits water, it reeks of vinegar within a few inches of it.)

Anyways, I missed my shot, 4 stamp bags. Almost completely missed it. Normally, when something goes wrong, I still feel some rush because I obviously didn't miss the whole thing, but this time I must have missed the whole thing or almost the whole thing, I was trying to let the tourniquet off before I started pushing instead of right after pushing, which is stupid because I've been doing this forever and my go-to, gnarly twisted vein probably actually prefers the tourniquet being on at this point. So anyways I tried calling to turn it off and I must have just lost the vein and not got much of anything in there.. I got a nasty, itchy, raised white area raised and red and white Etc but it wasn't horrible because I knew that it would go away quickly and they wouldn't have an abscess or anyting because this stuff isn't that nasty.

They refuse to allow the supply of pharmaceutical grade heroin that could be precisely and consistently dosed.

**Where there is a demand, there will be a supply.** Our governments continue to gift this lucrative and highly profitable illicit drug market to violent criminals and organized crime. 

The 50 billion dollars the US government spends on this ""War on drugs"" each and every year is a lot more than 50 billion because for every dollar they directly spend, many more must be subsequent spent attempting to clean up the mess it makes. The profits and taxes from regulated heroin could **help to pay down** national debt. With an end to the war, they might well be able to **actually pay down** the debt as the spin-off and indirect economic benefits would be far reaching and enormous.

Some 50% of people in US prisons are there for simple drug possession. Just one of the many reasons (all reasons are inappropriate) they won't change the prohibitionist drug laws is because private prisons are big business, yet the savings from ending the ""War on Drugs"" would easily allow them to continue to pay these companies for running prisons that would be empty if the war was to be ended.

It's also racist and remains so. These laws first came to be **not based on the harm from the drugs, but rather who was perceived to be using them.** The first drug prohibition laws in California and Nevada, driven by racist fears of Chinese transforming white women into opium-addicted sex slaves. The first cocaine prohibition laws, similarly prompted by racist fears of black men sniffing that white powder and forgetting their proper place in Southern society. And the first marijuana prohibition laws, all about fears of Mexican migrants in the West and the Southwest. 

Today, many years later, these prohibitionist drug laws remain what is also clearly a war against people who don't have light colored skin: If you are apprehended in possession of illicit drugs, you have either a 90% chance of going to prison or a 10% one which can be directly correlated to the shade of your skin color, outrageous!

This senseless and wasteful ‚ÄúWar on Drugs‚Äù is not only very wrong (on so many levels) but also the most epic failure and inappropriate legislative policy of all time and has caused totally unnecessary immense loss of life and inexcusable human suffering which will no doubt be viewed in the future much like human slavery and the Salem witch trials are today.",1546891161.0

Sup guys. I've been an opiate user and lover for the past 5 years or so of my life, particularly the last 2 1/2 or so. I started getting real heavy into painkillers after a bad breakup and got addicted to taking 1-4 of the little blue 30mg oxys every day for about a year. That whole year was pure bliss and I loved every minute of it... Mainly cuz my tolerance hadnt ever been completely shot yet and those blues always got me feeling warm, fuzzy, and hella happy/optimistic about life. 

Well... After that year my plug got cut off and I had the choice of continuing on with the blues for $35-$40 a piece (was getting em for $10 prior to that) which obviously would have made me broke fast, or switch to H which my good homie claimed was the cheaper route and got you wayyyy higher. I knew I had already done China white a few times before and I really enjoyed that, especially mixing it with the blues. But I was never too big of a fan of tar, which was what my homie was recommending. I remember always telling him ""dude I'm not addicted to H like you are, I'm addicted to painkillers""... But I figured if my only option to continue using opiates was to start with tar then fuck it I might as well (worst choice ever btw). 

So I started off with making my tar into ""cheese"" so it went from tar to a snortable powder, a RoA I was already fond of so I took a liking to this method, and sometimes doing ""monkey water"" where you melt the tar down in water then shoot it up your nose. I began liking it more and more and eventually I started smoking it, since my homie claimed it got you way higher, and also would be better for me since putting it in my nose always clogged my nose and was semi painful to do anyways... So I started smoking it and my habit got worse and worse and so much more expensive then I could have ever imagined. It actually made me go broke for the first time in my life...  (Was smoking around 1-1.5g a day)

So Ive been dealing with this addiction to H for about the past year and a half and have quit and relapsed like 5 times in that period. I always relapse cuz I think I'll be able to handle it again ""only on weekends"" or ""just for a few days"" but I always fall right back into the cycle.... 

So my question to you guys is, if I was to quit for months this time, and perhaps come back to opiates with just weak painkillers on occasion, maybe once a week or every other week if even, do you think I would be able to handle it? Or fall right back into the cycle in time? Have any of y'all had success with this type of thing? I don't wanna go back to H, but I would like to be able to enjoy a painkiller from time to time, just like I do with any other drug. 

TLDR: used to love painkillers but my habit progressed to H, I've quit 5 different times already but always relapse and start again. Id like to quit for months and perhaps come back using only weak painkillers on occasion, no more H whatsoever. Have any of y'all had success with this kind of thing before? ",1546881988.0

That got me thinking about when that happened to me.

So my girlfriend at the time got in a bit of trouble and had to go to a year long rehab a few states over. And at the time I thought she was the one haha, I was 19 and o was I wrong but that‚Äôs another story. I was upset so my usage went up. I lived in a party house , so about a month later, I met this girl . She was a solid 8. Big ass,nice c cup boobs, pretty face, and about 120 pounds. 

We clicked that night and ended up sleeping together. We fucked for hours without me cumming. But I was able to blame it on the booze, I don‚Äôt think she minded anyway lol. Opiates are great for first sexual impressions. So the next day we hung out. One thing led to another and we fucked with the same result. This time we where both ‚Äúsober‚Äù. After a while we stoped. I could tell she was bothered. So I told her that I was in my own head and felt bad that I was cheating. She knew I had a gf and that we where together for a couple years. So she bought it. I did feel bad but I was young, dumb, high, and horny lol. 

A few days later she comes over and we have sex. About 40 minutes in she gets up quick and goes in the bathroom. I knew what that was all about. She‚Äôs comes out a few minutes later and gets dressed. I ask her what‚Äôs wrong and she‚Äôs like ‚Äú I really like you a lot, i don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre attracted to me. I‚Äôve never not made a guy cum‚Äù. Now, I could tell her I‚Äôm a heroin addict, which might scare her off. And honestly the sex was really good. Or lie my ass off. 

I choose the latter. I told her the first 2 times was a fluke and I was almost about cum. So a couple hours later we fuck again. At about the 20 min part. I faked cumming haha o how the roles reversed. She was all like did you cum in me? I was like yeah I told you it wasn‚Äôt you. She wasn‚Äôt as happy as I thought she would be. She told me she was going to go home shower, get ready and come back. 

When she came back she seem super happy. A couple hours later she started puking excorist style. All over my bed, door, floor. It was vomiting at biblical proportions lol. So I clean her up and everywhere else. She is aslo erupting from the hole down under. I feel pretty bad for her. I ask her what she thinks she has. Well apparently projectile vomiting and explosive shits are possible side effects of plan b hahaha. She told me she wasn‚Äôt on the pill and she didn‚Äôt want to get pregnant. And she didn‚Äôt tell me she wasn‚Äôt on the pill because she didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd fuck her. I never told her I faked it lol. 

I ended up breaking up with my gf for her. We didn‚Äôt last, she cheated on me, big surprise lol. She broke up with about a week before my ex got out. And we got back together. I have super crazy stories about that gf if anyone cares to hear those stories ",1546881711.0

I have work at noon today so I was kinda dreading that until I decided to take some subs.

The only other time I had suboxone was last April in rehab and I wasn't using enough back then to really need any. Took 4mg and threw up for 24 hours pretty much because they way overshot the necessary dose if any lol. However, last night all my symptoms went away and are gone. I feel a just a little high but I will be able to function way better.

Two quick questions:

My withdrawls were pretty mild in the grand scheme of things, bout a 12 on the COWS scale. After this sub wears off will I be hurting very much at all anymore? 

Also, I have a dentist appt Friday and they are sedating me because I hate the dentist but the mixture I heard him say was fent and midazolam along with something else. Will the bupe or naloxone interfere?

Within two weeks of starting back up the pain returns. 
I don‚Äôt use any formulations containing APAP. 

Have any of you experienced this, or know of any issues that can arise involving your kidneys after long time use of prescription opioids? I have a PM appointment in a few weeks and plan to bring it up, I just want to ask around a little in the mean time.

After an unusually long wait (30 mins....he‚Äôs pretty good with time and I‚Äôm typically out of there within 10 mins), he pulls up and comes to the passenger side window of the car I‚Äôm in.

But whatever, I tell him $20, he reaches into his pocket and gives me my shit.

We pull out right away and as we‚Äôre a couple blocks down the street, I retrieve the goods from my pocket and that‚Äôs when I realize he actually gave me a Full bun (10 bags).

Now, I realize this isn‚Äôt too big of a deal...just a $20 mistake on his part. But I‚Äôm still not sure as to the proper etiquette for this.

&#x200B;

I need some insight from you fine people. Typically I only stick to oxys when it comes to daily use. However, for the past week straight I have been trying to cut down my oxy use because I can no longer afford to spend $300 a day on 10 30s... I had the brilliant idea to try and combat my cravings to do more oxy by using cocaine all day long with my oxys. The past week, I managed to cut my oxy intake down from a 300mg daily habit to I believe 150mg at most in one day. The other days I managed to only use around 90mg on average. Now, the problem is I told myself I would stop using cocaine after 2 days of consecutive use, but it's now been 7 days in a row and I am starting to get worried. When I jump off the oxy's completely, I am well aware that I will have to go through withdrawal from them. However, will a week straight of cocaine use ranging from .5 to 1g a day cause withdrawal symptoms from coke as well? I've also been taking 1-2mg of xanax a night the past 3 nights in order to fall asleep. I know this combination is dangerous and you all will probably think i'm a dumbass, but god damn doing coke and blues at the same time is fucking amazing. 

&#x200B;

Pretty much I'm just wondering how long it usually takes someone to begin to withdrawal from coke? at first I thought it would be similar to people who just began using oxy/dope daily where it takes like 1-2 months of consecutive daily use, but I have very little information on coke withdrawals and how long consecutive daily use would cause someone to withdrawal.

I just want to tell you my story guys and will understand how Wika is wonderful.

&#x200B;

We've been together for a year now. Yay ! But before we were a couple i was addicted to xanax. I was popping 12 to 20 xans a day. Wika, was the closest friend i ever had and I've known her for almost 10 years. When we began dating I was addicted to Xanax and she knew it but didn't think much of it until the first dinner she organized. She invited her friends over to introduce me. Everything was going fine until i was so high on ketamine and xanax that i broke a frame on her wall while walking like a drunk. That ended the night and all of her friends saw me as a fucked up druggie. Wika was mad at me for acting like a foul and she was right. I completely ruined that night and she was so happy to introduce me but i fuck it up.

&#x200B;

I made everything to make her angry at me while i was on xanax and she always forgave me because everything i said i would stop i did not. Then i started texting with my ex while i was high only when on xanax. I nearly lost Wika because of my bad behavior. I'm so sorry I'm still asking myself why are you still with me. I decided to stop xanax for good and i completely stop all contacts with my ex because its wrong and because i love my Wika more than anything. I wont be able to live without her. She's my goddess and i want to spend of my life with her.

&#x200B;

A couple weeks ago we found a way to get Hydromorphone and Midazolam vials. So we began injecting. I already have a problem with both opiates and benzo in my past but how can i say no when i see Wika shooting up. She's the one who do the dirty work and obtain those vials. The addict in me feel like im not getting enough of it. She has the control of all of these vials mostly because i cant stop abusing Midazolam. I stole some vials a couple of time in the back of my girl because of my selfishness and she found out. I said i would never do it again but i did. Im so sorry, i know you could never trust me anymore. Thats why i decided to write this. To show you how sincere i am with my promise. I know it will take time for you to trust me again. I can show you that im able to respect my promise.

&#x200B;

Wika i love you more than anything. Its not easy for me to control myself with all that drugs near me but i can do it. I don't want to break you heart anymore. I know heard that alot of time but like i said i will control myself. I wont do anything on your back anymore because i will loose you and thats my biggest fear. Wika you're so good to me. Too good. You're the best thing that ever happen to me and i dont want to loose that.

&#x200B;

Since we've been shooting Hydromorphone regularly its been hard on our couple. We get mad at each other so easily and i feel that our relationship is fragile but i would do anything possible to please you like before. Opiates are really great together. I love our morning shots and our night shoot. The ones at your break. I dont want this to end i mean our relationship. Not because of drugs.

&#x200B;

Wika i love you more than anything in the world. Thank you for bringing me to BC last summer even if we had a rough ending in WDs for a week.

Here is the kicker. I grew up playing hockey almost from the day I could walk. I grew up despising basketball a sport I despise to this day. I suck at basketball I can‚Äôt make a basket to save my life I don‚Äôt understand the rules and the rules I do understand I absolutely hate cause they seem to make the game cater to pussies as absolutely 0 contact is allowed and well in hockey it‚Äôs the absolute opposite.

Anyways apparently in my fantasy tho I‚Äôm Stephen curry and  am sinking baskets at an incredible rate. Here‚Äôs the kicker tho. My aunt heard me in the other room and knowing I was alone was a tad bit confused about my enthusiasm/slurring of this basketball lecture so when she came to my room I had to think fast..,so I grabbed my phone and pretended i was on a call and had it on speaker.

The thing that sucks about using opiates for a long time is that you remember that feeling of warmth and positivity. That pure happiness and optimistic outlook. I never had physical dependance on them but what kept me going back was the need to feel something. Feeling normal just sucks. Nothing compares and it just feels like something is missing all the time.

So, one day on one of my many smoke breaks which I took on the left corner of the store as you were going out, the familiar and undeniable smell of weed flows by me. There were a few cars parked on the side of the building so I figured it was one of those. As I kept smelling it (and I'm not talking about some skunk shit either. The kids in this neighborhood came from upper-middle class homes so of course they had good smoke) I decided to see just where it was coming from. I didn't have to go far to see one of the regulars kids going ""Oh, shit the long haired guys seen us! Hide the shit! Spray the car!"" So, I creep up to the car and allow a wicked smile to crawl across my face. ""So, Max, what you doing buddy?""

Max, being about 16 or 17, I think, wasn't to knowledgeable about the ways of the world. He didn't know that a long haired white guy probably smoked weed. Knowing this I proceeded to fuck with him hard.

Max: Nothing, man. Just deciding what we want to get.

Me: Fuck, it smells like good weed out here! You guys smell that?

Max: Must be one of the other cars. (He says this while pot smoke continues to bellow out of his car window, mind you.)

Me: Ok, could you guys do me a favor?

Max: Yea, whats up?

Me: Quit bullshitting and pass that shit!

Well, he in fact did pass that shit, and from then on I had an understanding. Here were a list of rules that I gave Max and his friends.

&#x200B;

1. I don't know shit.
2. Only weed is to be smoked out here. If I see you out here snorting coke or shooting heroin I am telling your parents. (Also, for any of you out here wondering if I ever gave these kids pills FUCK TO THE NO!!! I sure as fuck wasn't about to get that started.)
3. Don't bother other customers with it.

I told them that as long as they kept it cool and followed those rules I didn't give a shit. They could smoke in blockbuster parking lot any time they wanted.

Now for those of you who are about to give me shit let me explain something. I didn't want these kids getting a fucking drug charge or worse over something as benign as pot. This way back before even Colorado thought about legalizing it so, the charges were steeper than they are now.",1546809771.0

Have you ever met, or dealt with, a plug that had literally no business being a plug? I mean you seen some of the shit they did and you wonder how they haven't been caught?

Let me tell you about one of mine.

This stupid bitch was like sixty something and dumber than a bag of hammers. First of all, they would always have at least 5 to 6 cars in their driveway. This might be something you could do occasionally but, damn near everyday doesn't make you look like a plug at all. Then, after you found a place to park and went inside it looked like a goddamn waiting room. You would sit in here living room/kitchen and wait for her to call you up stairs. Of course, the conversations going on down there were about what the came here to get. So, if anyone happened to record ANYTHING they could very well hang the whole room. (Someone did this and I am getting to that keep reading)

But letting this shit go on wasn't even the stupidest. This mother fucker was basically a pharmacy. She made bank but, then she would give said ""bank"" to her ""boyfriend over seas who had all this money but, needed her to send him money for a plane ticket home"" or ""Nigerian princes"" What's more, she had one son that weighed every bit of 800lbs and had never seen his own dick let alone a vagina. So, a friend of a friend sets him up with this bitch that has two mean ass kids. Heres the thing with that. All she cared about was money and/or drugs. So, guess what she would threaten to do if he wouldn't give her any money or said ""Kick rocks"" cause he was tired of her shit? Start recording people, people who thought they were to ""Acquire said goods"" and had no baring on anything going on over there. I mean, I saw this stupid bitch sitting across from the drive way recording people. All of this so she would have something to hold over the sons head if he ever tried to get rid of her. Oh, but she wasn't done yet... Her two dumb ass kids were telling the school system what was going on over there. This place was raided at least two times that I can remember hearing about.

But, wait there's more...

She gets her ex-con cousin to move in with her who is required to have random visits from his parole officer. This cousin of hers was also still balls deep into his own game. So now you have all this shit going on among the plugging! And, no, it really didn't stop people from coming over there. Business might have dropped a little, but people still kept going over there. I myself quit going over there when I heard about people being pulled over as the left her street.

Not to mention after awhile the stupid bitch started playing favorites. This happened a lot with other plugs I know. When I first got into this I always thought it was whoever had the money. Just tell you how stupid she was with this: my grand mother passed away a few years ago and left be a decent chunk of change. I call up this dumb ass plug and say ""I got 3 grand and I want whatever you got"" (Also, she had known me for a few years at this point so it wasn't like she had known me a month and I was trying to buy her out) And the dumb mother fucker comes back with ""I got other people to sell too"" and wouldn't sell me shit. What had happened she was selling everything to these well off mother fuckers who were paying 10 per back when the standard was 6. 

Safe to say I got away from this doofy bitch before anything really bad happened....",1546794334.0

He's a cool guy and knows we like to experiment now and then with drugs, especially psychs and ketamine, but we never touch opiates/oids unless they're straight out of a pharmacy... considering this damn fentanyl monster that assholes brought around ruining the possibility to safely enjoy so many substances we enjoy :( 

A few years ago he gave us a a few scripts of oxy 30's and we snorted through all of those over the course of a year or so. This time though, there's something about this hydromorphone molecule that is especially euphoric - the 2 of us each snorted about 40 (so about 80 of the initially 90 we were gifted) over the course of the last few days while eating a lot of LSD and fucking like animals all over the house.

Anyways, we decided instead of keeping the last 9 and a half 2mg Dillys we had left, we'd just finish them off so they wouldn't be on our mind and then take a nice year (or several year) break from opiates again. 

We did some research to avoid a freak accident and grabbed one of her dads unused insulin syringes that he has all over the place, as well as the other prep materials recommended.

This is the first and only time we're ever tried shooting something (except I want some IV LSD or DMT when I'm on my deathbed!)
She went first and still wasn't feeling anything by the time she was giving me my (2x2mg) 4 mg shot and I didn't feel anything for a few minutes either.

Then all of a sudden.... BAMMMM OOOOh AHHHH WOW! It hit us like a train! Now i know why so many people struggle with addiction especially when needles get involved. Starting to come down but can still barely keep one eye open enough to see what I'm doing trying to type lol. 

I am never going to Iv anything else again (unless it's in a hospital or something for legitimate medical reason(s)), although as you might imagine I'm very glad I finally killed my curiousity regarding IV administration of a drug and have no desire to repeat this experience, mainly because it feels WAY TOO GOOD...

Backstory: IV opiate user for 6-7years, ruined everything. Broken engagement, lost a 6 figure job at age 22, over doses, lost loved ones, homelessness, jail time, felony record... Ect.

I make parole in October after killing out a calendar. Decide im done with it. Moved home and got into a suboxone clinic. Been doing exceptionally well considering where I was. Had a slip up for a week or so when I found some insanely cheap Dilaudid. Started seeing myself slip up again and got back on track.

So with a past like myself, and all that follows, finding love or any meaningful personal relationships can be a chore. The thoughts of how do I tell them about my past? My record? Things that should be someone's knowledge if they're going to dive into a relationship. 

I go to Tinder trying to just throw myself out there. I start talking to this girl and we flirt and talk on the phone text back and forth then I meet up with her last night.  She's insanely beautiful, smart, funny, nice body, good job. The whole package. We go out for a few drinks and dinner and start to talk. She asks if I'm happy to be in this new state vs where I just came from. I say yeah, I had to leave. It was just far to toxic for me. 

She responds with how where she moved from was toxic for her too. I ask her why and she flat out says well my drug of choice was dilaudid... Holy fucking shit!??! 

She has a similar past, record, everything I was nervous about she has been through the same thing. She has been clean for 5 years and off suboxone for 2. She comes back to my place and we hit it off. Have plans to go to her place tonight. 

To wrap it up I just want to thank Junkie Cupid for aligning the stars and allowing me to be myself and enjoy the company of someone who understands first hand an opioid addiction. Don't want to fall head over heels to soon but damn.

Update: She stood me up today. No calls, texts or anything. Had a night planned out to take her to dinner and go mini golfing. Wish I hadn't taken my subs earlier. Wanting some H real bad. Fuck it.",1546790686.0

ps: don‚Äôt need anyone to preach to me abt not doing heroin, etc etc, where i live it is very, very rare so i know i overpaid for it and i probably won‚Äôt ever buy more. tyvm üíñ",1546754456.0

Some similar to what Im going to say, but so different. I am in my mid thirties, for the most part healthy, lift approx 5xs week, mom of two. I was prescribed tramadol from my doctor approx 9.5/10 years ago. Was prescribed 50mg, take 1/2 tabs every 4/6 hours as needed all those years. So, i took my full 8 pills daily. About 5 years into it, i lost my insurance. Tried to stop my meds, it was pure hell. Already knew i was dependant at that point. I couldnt take wd's and ended up doing private pay to keep seeing my doc. So, still no insurance & he retired a year ago. So, since last January, i basically have had one reliable place to get tramadol, but not as many i was used to. Plus, omg, i hate buying them after i used to pay $10 for my month supply. Im a normal person, not a partier, but i cant kick these. I forced tapered myself from 8 pills day to 4. Well, now day 3, no meds. I cant handle it..ppl dont realize how hard trams are to come off, cause they work on your serotonin & you are basically having the effects of opiate & antidepressant wd simultaneously. Mine has been almost all antidepressant discontinuation problems. I cant sleep. I will fall asleep about 5am, sleep 3 hours, and im exhausted..the rls and pains in my legs, now its my entire body..my arms and fingers even tingle. I have no energy.  Im trying to get a grip. Everyone who knows me, knows. Im not ashamed. I was legally prescribed this and never abused it. I think ppl think im crazy. Its hell. This isn't even all my issues from it. Im just exhausted and thought instead of searching threads, maybe I'd write one. If anyone has any advice. Anything, feel free. I want to say, i dont think like an addict. I like how i feel on my meds, but i dont feel high. If i get my meds, i never take more than ive tapered to. I dont wan my body get used to any higher dose. Someone gave me 2 percs. I didnt really want them, but i break in half and it almost takes the edge off. That stronger medicene does nothing for my body compared to the ""weak"" tramadol. I know, im gon hear... kratom, tried a few times, no luck. Smoke... it doesnt do anything except kill my lungs..if i had access to cbd oil, id most def use that.

Background - exactly 6 months run. All pills either M30 or OP80. Snorted and swallowed. Very high usage no lower than 160mg per day and as high as 560mg in 24 hours, probably averaging 400mg per day.

Last week just op80s, swallowed, (mostly) not crushed. 3 in 24 hours for a few days, 2 for a few days, 1 for 2 days, today is Day 1 completely off (36 hours since last dose) and I feel withdrawals about a 1.5/10 level. Took kratom twice today.

I suspect the OP80s are really equal to about a 30mg dose. Yes, I know it contains 80mg, but it doesn‚Äôt all hit u at once so maybe it works on softening down the fall to the bottom.

To say the least, I‚Äôm absolutely, completely, entirely, fucking shocked.

Any thoughts?",1546726076.0

However, I've not only been a member of this sub since damn near the beginning, but up until a few days haven't made a post here, or for that matter, on Reddit is roughly 8 months when I went MIA. Many people sent me private messages asking if I was OK and have even asked I was still alive.  
  
I am, thank God, but since my absence, and even sporadic posting before that, this sub has gained SO many new members, and a lot of you probably don't recognize my username. That's OK, it's fine. That's not what this is about.  
  
I would just like to take the time to re-entroduce myself to some of the newer members that truly don't realize what a massive asshole I am.   
  
Like I said; I'm nobody special, but in the old days, before Reddit, there was a thing we call message boards, bulletin boards, etc, and in those communities, especially the smaller ones, it was traditional, and sometimes even *required* to make a post/thread in an introduction/new members sub-forum to formally introduce, and tell the other members a little bit about yourself.

I had no idea people would ask me to tell more about that lol. So, I will try to post a new story in this sub detailing my twenty years in this game. Thats right from the time I was 14 and hit by a truck till now (Well really I have just laid off alot I am not totally sober by any means) I have had my eyes if nothing else in the game. So, to start let me give ya'll a few bits of knowledge I have gotten from my tenure with pills.

First of all if you're just getting into this, get out now. If this were, say, ten years ago I would say ""Have fun."" But, given that the economy has inflated as it often does,  what use to be 5 dollars per is now going up as high as 10. Not to mention that most people can only see one doctor at a time any more and even in the drug game there is supply and demand. Its just basic economy.

Also, stop snorting the damn things and get more for your money. When you snort a OC or a RC all you're doing is getting that high for about an hour. If you would chew it up and A) that high would hit you in about ten minutes and B) that high would last you between 6 to 8 hours. Why the fuck would you pay 25 dollars for one tiny pill for an hour of euphoria?

And Lastly, H is not a good substitute. Why it does the same thing do you have any idea of how much your're getting or how strong the dose is? No. Not to mention all the shit that goes with using needles and all that. I know you can eat it, but if I am not mistaken don't it also put you to sleep? I use my high to get shit done not sleep all day. ",1546723546.0

I had to take a 10-panel non-DOT drug test for a new job.  I was stressing *hard* about it because I take about 60-70 mg of Vicodin per day and have for years, and don't currently have a prescription for it.  (Ironically, I need the health insurance from a new job in order to maybe see about getting a prescription...). I only had 3 days in which to take the test, so not enough time to quit.

I read just about every single thread on here and the weed subs about synthetic urine, and got some Quick Fix 6.2 from the manufacturer.  Didn't want to trust that getting it elsewhere was the real product.

Every thread I read emphasized practicing walking around with it wherever you plan to store it, and I completely agree with that.  I spent a good 60-90 minutes trying different places, etc.  I had gotten the 3 oz bottle, and found that that was too large to put anywhere discreetly, so I transferred it into a smaller travel bottle.  The problem with that was that there's a temperature strip on the original bottle and I was kind of stressed that it would end up being the wrong temp.

Anyhow, once I got it appropriately heated and tucked, I went to the clinic and filled out the paperwork and had to wait about 10 minutes.  Sitting in a waiting room trying to look natural and comfortable with a travel bottle and a heatpack in one's panties is a challenge.

The woman took me into an office and verified my ID and all that, asked me if I had anything in my pockets and showed me to the bathroom.  She put blue tablets in the toilet to turn the water, told me I had **90 seconds** and left.

I dumped the travel bottle into the sample cup while peeing in the toilet for real, and used a few drops around the rim of the cup because I had read that some lab techs will actually smell it (!!!).

After I came out, she took it and transferred it into a special cup, sealed it and then plugged it into some machine, had me sign a few things and I left.

The next week or so, I was really stressed out every time my phone rang, thinking it was going to be the MRO (medical review officer, who has to call you if there's an issue), but I never heard from them.  After 10 days, I emailed HR at the potential job and they told me that everything was good to go!

I would definitely try to quit and be clean next time, but this is a great option.  The only thing is that if your paperwork says ""X panel test **with confirmation**"", synthetic isn't an option, because the confirmation part is further testing to make sure it's human urine.

Anyhow, this is hella long, but I'm hoping that my experience helps someone else.",1546722430.0

Just know that you could go to several Doctors at once and as long as you used a different pharmacy for each script you were fine.

  
  Now what I will dedicate this post to is telling you just how much of a role pain pills played in the scheme of things. As I said before people often gave me pills for free movies. Now lets do the math. A woman once gave me 10 lortab tens for two movies. So, for roughly 8 dollars worth of movies I was given fifty dollars worth of pills. 

  
  But, wait there's more... 

  
  I wasn't the only person there taking them. 

  
  Enter Jason my store manager. Back in the day, high school and thereafter, we experimented with everything. From pot to katamine (not sure how you spell it but, it was a cat tranquilizer that you snorted, also called special K). After being hit by a truck at the age of 14 in 1998 I was given pain pills hand over fist and was even one of the first test subjects of Oxycontin. (Long before anyone figured out you had to crash them) So, naturally, being unaware of what the could do in long term I shared with him. 

  
  And, then I created a monster... 

  
  Folks, do you know what doesn't mix well with power? Anything, really but, pain pills sure as hell don't. I taught him how to play the doctor shopping game and the musical pharmacy game. He was already an asshole but, now he was an asshole over 9000. When he didn't have his fix he was the asshole from outer space. 

  
  And he didn't start small like the every other addict on earth. He wouldn't take one or two. Oh no. By my early twenties I was up to taking 7 per dose. So, trying to win a pissing contest that no one ever actually started he started taking 14 right off the bat. I mean as soon as he got a doctor of his own he was eating this things by the literal handfuls. 

  
  Now while being high as hell on the things, especially at a young age, you felt like you could do anything. There was nothing like taking a dose on a Friday and Saturday night and being able to run the length of the store for the customer to get a move they wanted. Also, even though I didn't need the pills for this, I had this little trick I would do with those long yellow locks in the side of the DVD and game cases. Where I would pull it out of the bottom of the case and flip it up in the air. That trick alone people came to see. Not to mention all the rewards I could sell on those nights. 

  
  Then, there was what it felt like when you didn't have anything and was left cold after a three or four day bender. You muscles cramped. You had the shits from hell. There were plenty of times I was paid seven dollars an hour to take a shit. Literally. You didn't feel like dealing with people let alone pissy people who were trying to get out of a late fee or a ‚Äúrestocking fee‚Äù (also known as bullshit). ",1546720268.0

Anyway, it was just like the movie, instead of people eating the different candies, they were eating different pills. The golden tickets were hidden in peoples prescription bottles when they picked up from the pharmacy or in a dboys dope baggies. Instead of the chocolate river it was hydromorphone solution.

Now that I have been paying again, I can‚Äôt enjoy it. The price of this stuff alone makes me want to quit.. 

I am self employed. On a bad month I make 5k, an average month I make 8100, and a great month I make 10ish. 

If you had income like this and a savings of ~ 13k, rent paid, and 8/900$ in your pocket.. would you feel guilty spending 3-400$ on a weeks worth of opana?

Sorry if this is a weird question. I know money is a touchy subject but I have become so damn greedy I can‚Äôt even enjoy my high.. I think the money is finally more addicting haha.. curious how everyone here justifies the $$ we all spend on this to themselves?

I mean if the bills are paid, rents paid, the savings are 5 digits, and I got 8/900$ in my pocket, and I‚Äôm under 30 and single(28 years old), should it be that big of a deal to drop 3-400$ a week? I mean I‚Äôm online asking strangers haha.. it‚Äôs driving me mad. I would probably chase a dropped quarter at this point haha

Sometimes when i think about all I‚Äôve spent I wanna pull my hair out even though I‚Äôm not broke. How do you guys roll with it? I got spoiled by not having to buy my stuff for a half year or so and can‚Äôt adjust.. it‚Äôs tripping me out. EDIT: I also hate that I‚Äôm wasting money. Every time I snort one of these I think of how I could have given the $ to a homeless shelter or someone in need.. I want to help people, it‚Äôs my thing, and I could help so much more than I do if I could cut this spending! I just hate not having anything to show for it. 

Opiates do make my life quality so much better though. The times I‚Äôve quit I always ended up planning my suicide about 15-21 days clean ( I was crazy and attempted suicide twice before I ever touched drugs... they saved my life sorta and made me able to function enough to start a successful business) and then say fuck it and go back because.. I‚Äôd rather be alive on opiates then dead. 
 ..I have some lifelong illness‚Äô that arent curable and cause insane amounts of pain and makes it very hard to sleep (I sleep 2-5hr a night since 2015) and so hard to socialize with people. Opiates save me from the loneliness and pain. But they‚Äôre so fucking expensive. And after I‚Äôm on them 24/7 I have to take breaks because they loose that magic and I feel numb and not like a real person. I‚Äôll loose interest in a lot. It‚Äôs such a double edge soward- they save me but they also dull me. And the fucking cost!!!

During all of his cardiac events, they use 2 types of syringes.

Temporary account for obvious reasons. My wife recently slipped on ice and completely shattered her ankle while tearing all of her ligaments. The doctors gave her an oxycodone prescription @ 10mg every 4 hours for 5 days. They also gave us a naloxone kit free of charge which made me worry about the dosage. I haven‚Äôt slept in 48 hours (since the fall) and would love to get some sleep without worrying about her, so I figured it‚Äôd be best to ask you guys about the dosage and whether or not the kit was overkill.

1) Is she at risk of developing a physical dependency at that dosage for the length listed above?

2) Was the naloxone kit overkill or is she actually in danger of OD-ing at that dosage?

No previous narcotic use//healthy otherwise.

Thanks guys!",1546648585.0

A little background, I used oxy for about 5 years. Typical story, went from a blue every Sunday to about 210+ mg a day. Recently stopped, didn't use for about 5-6 weeks then ""relapsed"" (I don't count it a relapse because I never intended on ""quitting"", just didn't want to have to use everyday). And chipping is actually going well, had a 3 day binge before new years but haven't used since the 31st. Things are good.

HOWEVER, I will be the first one to acknowledge that I just genuinely enjoy being high in general. Opiates are and always will be my ride or die, but I just hate being sober.

I post this here because I know some of yall have been there, but fuck guys/gals, I have spent so much fucking money on this shit.

I had done a calculation of how much I spent, TWO YEARS AGO, and it came up to nearly 55-60k. I don't even want to know what it's at now. But fuck I could have bought a new car in cash AND put a fat ass down payment on a house. It's weird how certain drugs put things in perspective like this, but idk I'm just in a weird place right now. Overall I have an amazing outlook for the future, but fuuuuuuuuuuck do I feel some tremendous guilt. 

Sorry to vent. I'm more of a lurker than a poster but I still consider everyone of you family. Everyone one of you would be exponentially more understanding than my real family would be toward me. Shit, I haven't talked to either parents in almost 3 months now. If anyone wants to talk, PM me.

aclsdn,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/aclsdn/post_appendectomy_questions/,7,https://redd.it/aclsdn,Dane-o-myt,Post Appendectomy Questions!,"Hey every!

So Wednesday morning during work I started to get an ache in my abdomen. Got worse and worse until I had to leave work (which I never do, that was the second time I've EVER taken sick time at a job). Went home, grabbed a bug out bag, and went to urgent Care. After some poking and prodding, a blood test, and a CT scan, I was told to drive over to a different hospital to get my appendix removed.

Surgery (laparoscopic) from 9pm-9:50pm. Woke up from anesthesia at 10:30-11pm. Was home by 1am. I'm going back to work at my physically demanding job, but will be on light duty for the whole week. 

I am a user of kratom, but I have never used a traditional opiate before, so I have some questions.

When I woke up they were asking me about my pain level. I said I was a 2-3 sore, so they gave me some IV fentanyl. They asked me about my pain level after it was administered, and I said the same thing. Dosage unknown. Didn't really notice any difference.

Once I was fully awake, they monitored my vitals for a while and asked if I wanted some pain meds. Well DUH. So they write me a prescription, which my nurse helped me pick up on my way out the door. 

I was proscribed 12 hydromorphone at 2mg a piece. 

Woke up the next day, ate a couple crackers, and took one pill. Felt absolutely nothing. 

4 hours later, I took 2 pills. Again felt nothing.

In the evening I was sore, so I took 6 grams of kratom. That helped me out a bunch. Took 4 grams right before bed, which was a mistake because it made me sleep not so well.

So here's my questions:

Why did I not feel the fentanyl? Was it because I was still kind of intoxicated the anesthesia? 

Is hydromorphone a strong drug? I was looking at some charts of opiates. The couple that I had read said that hydromorphone was 7.5 times stronger than morphine. So 1.3mg hydromorphone is equal to 10mg morphine when taken orally. Were my 2mg and 4mg dosages not enough to feel? That's how much it said to take on the bottle.

I used to use 16 grams of kratom a day for a while. In December I quit cold turkey for a full week for tolerance break. Used for two days, then took just around two weeks off. My tolerance has decreased significantly. Would my kratom usage over the last couple years make it so I wouldn't feel the hydromorphone? 

After reading the rules I am pretty sure this is allowed. If anyone has questions or needs me to clarify anything, let me know. My pain is being managed pretty well just by not moving and ibuprofen, but I also took kratom again because I need to run to the hospital for a doctor's note. I have 9 pills left, and am planning on saving them for a rainy day at the moment.

Any advice is appreciated.

So September 2017, I got into a car accident and broke my right foot, left clavicle, and left forearm. I had to have surgery done to put metal hardware in the collar bone and forearm. A few months later, I fell and broke my left forearm again, and had to have surgery to take out the old hardware, and put in longer metal plates. During these 4 or 5 months of recovery, collectively, I had quite a few scripts for different pain medications prescribed to me by my orthopedic surgeon. Also maybe worth adding, I have a prosthetic leg, and after the car accident it does not fit as well anymore. Sometimes it can be quite painful to wear for long periods of time. Additionally, I frequently get aches in my left forearm.

I'm not sure if any of this this would be serious enough to warrant a doctor prescribing me medication, but I figured I would ask. Anyone with any similar conditions ever have any luck? I'm mostly curious about, what kind of doctor I should go see (my GP, or maybe back to my orthos office?), if I should even bother trying, and how I should ask. Thanks :)

Its hard for me to understand those that continue using lesser opioids like codeine to oxycodone instead of using kratom. It can be very strong if you get a reliable source.

I jumped from 100 mg prescription methadone to kratom, and had no withdrawal. I even felt pretty good. I had to go to the ER and was given hydromorphone every 2 hours. Then an oxycodone prescription after. And honestly the kratom worked better, I noticed. And i had no desire to go back to the other ones.

I mean the pros are that it's way, way cheaper, fairly strong, stops even strong opioid withdrawal, has different types, good at a step towards getting life together.

I'm not lecturing anyway at all! I'm just curious why some of the you don't switch. I can see it with opana or heroin of course.

There's definitely cons to kratom though. If you've taken some bad quality kratom, it probably seemed like shit. Its less predictable than a regulated dose. Its relatively weak (though on par with... Well.. it's in between hydrocone and oxycodone for me). It's finnicky in a way and can make some people nauseous if they don't know what they're doing. Also it tastes terrible. But most addicts have gone through worse than a bad taste for feeling normal.

But it's legal in most places and really has saved a lot of lives. It took me from essentially homeless to middle class income and a good life. Even people without opiate issues have found tremendous value in it. Which is probably why there's a massive outcry when they try to ban it. A lot of older people use it. The kind that vote.

But I don't know. I see if it gets banned, there's going to be a lot more heroin addicts coming up.

What's your experience with it? Good, bad? Was it weak or strong?

Haven't used any traditional opiates since 2013 (besides those given by a doctor once or twice and taken as directed). Have no will to go back to all that when kratom is dirt cheap. Unless you buy the bunk smoke shop stuff.",1546595396.0

Conflicted and could use some input,"Alright so last night I made a post referring to the amount of suboxone I've been taking the past week and a half (besides 2 days of dope). Basically I came clean to my family today, I am a 21 year old addict primarily oxy heroin (strong opioids in general) and benzos. I had a year completely sober living in sober houses and was beyond miserable the entire time although people say physically glowing, and managed to accomplish a significant amount in that time (get my first real apartment, hold down a decent job, save lots of money, etc). When I moved out of sober living it was not long until I relapsed on oxy, as this addiction shit goes it got worse and worse and was hanging on by a thread not becoming physically addicted. I had 2 days sober I want to say and I couldn't even motivate myself to get out of bed a couple weeks ago with no real physical withdrawals just insane depression. I have crippling anxiety, depression and am my own worst enemy. I have spent probably a few grand on oxy at this point, was getting back into heroin, and becoming extremely chemically unstable up in my brain beyond the problems I suffer from without the drugs. My family is on board with me seeing a sub doctor, and I am thinking that it might be good for me considering I struggle so much with complete sobriety (self doubt, insecurities, etc). Since I've been taking the suboxone I have noticed a much more balanced mentality in myself and I genuinely believe that getting suboxone prescribed by a doctor may be seriously beneficial for me for the time being. I would like to use suboxone as a tool to help me feel normal, and what I mean by this is use it in a way that I can wake up everyday, work, continue to think about my future and keep my eye on the prize, which would be success and happiness. For those of you who have been on suboxone for 6 months and over, what does it feel like to you? Still at this point of taking it it improves my mood, makes me sociable, kills the negative thoughts in my head for the most part (self doubt, self consciousness, insecurities) which are some of the greatest things holding me back considering I am loved by so many. I returned to my home town last weekend after almost 2 years all drugged out because of how unstable I was and how in the grips of addiction I've been and I felt so bad to appear like that in front of my friends who love and care about me so much. I don't want to be on suboxone forever, I just want to be on it at least until I can adjust to this new life in a new city all by myself a little more adequately, considering I've been struggling so much with it. Will these positive feelings that i receive from suboxone last? I'm not looking for a high as I know that will not last, I just want to know it it will continue to help me in the fields stated above in boosting my mood and limiting negative thoughts. Plus I can't keep spending disgusting amounts on oxy and I can't keep fucking with heroin ruining myself making my life a living hell. Any input would be great please and thank you! Also would like to add that if I go to a sub doctor which I would imagine could take a week or two and no longer have opiates in my system besides bupe, but am honest about what has been going on like I stated above, would it be possible that the dr would give me any trouble writing the scrip? Just curious. Again any experience/input would be great.

Tldr: planning on going to sub dr. Will mood boost, lack of negative thoughts (insecurities, self doubt, low self esteem, anxiety, depression, etc) sociability and motivation I receive from subs last? Also if a urine test comes back only bupe but explain I have been struggling with oxy/heroin addiction telling the truth will the doctor have any issues with writing me a script?

acexp8,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/acexp8/wanna_hear_a_story/,13,https://redd.it/acexp8,geef1tz,Wanna hear a story?,"So there was this guy that I was seeing for a while, and every week or so he switched up his number. After seeing him for about 6 to 8 months I had gotten used to the fact that random numbers would call my phone and it would be him with a new burner. So one night, I get a call from a random phone number and I ask for 3 assuming it‚Äôs him (the guy sounded exactly the same on phone).  I hop in the car and head up and I call when I‚Äôm 15 min out and he tells me to go to somewhere that‚Äôs way on the other side of the city. Again, for some reason, I thought nothing of this as chalked it up to rotating his spots. Anyways, I get to the spot and shoot him an ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here‚Äù text and I proceed to wait. After about 20 mins some guy I‚Äôd never seen before walked up to my window and handed me my order. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs odd, I never met him before‚Äù I thought. I looked at what he gave me and I noticed that it was 6-.5‚Äôs and not all in one like normal and again I thought about how that was a lil strange, but by now I‚Äôm not feeling good and decide to pull into a McDs to do a shot. I put 2 bags in and did everything like normal as far as prep goes. When I pushed in the plunger I got a fat rush and then I all of a sudden got what started to feel like the good pins and needles and it slowly turned into a super hot and almost painful prickly sensation. It got to the point where my whole body was hot and felt like I was rolling in a bed of pins. Well, I realized that something was wrong, and not wanting to die in an empty-ass McDs parking lot at 3 am, I put the car in gear and got on the road to try and get home . Next I knew I was laying on the side of the road (in a puddle no less) with 2 EMts over me shaking me saying my name. Turns out I ODed, and at 65 mph I flew off the road and blasted a tree, totaling my new car (and killing the tree too). I noticed 2 state troopers were going through my vehicle. They found my kit and started asking a bunch of questions like when I last used and watnot. The fact that I had a prior for class A didn‚Äôt help. Not wanting to fuck myself over any more that evening, I preceded to clutch my head and  play super dumb and kept repeating ‚Äúmy head hurts, I need to lay down and rest‚Äù. Well after 5 mins, the state trooper that was questioning me gave up and told the emts ‚Äúhe‚Äôs yours‚Äù and I went to the hospital. I ended up getting a fat morphine shot before the nurses actually read my med history and saw that I was ‚Äòexperienced ‚Äò, after which they got pissed and treated me like an asshole.  After 2 hours I realize that I still have the other 4 bags and somehow the cop didn‚Äôt find it. I went home, did a shot (safely this time) and picked up my replacement rental car, an Infinity QX60, which actually helped to soothe the pain of having wrecked my car. Later that day, my normal dude called and asked me why I didn‚Äôt come up last night and I told him about what happened. He was shocked and told me that it must‚Äôve been from when he had an old phone stolen. Apparently in my area, dudes steal work phones from dboys and take over all their custys, and that‚Äôs what happened in this particular situation. I never heard from the mystery other dude ever again and ended up getting straightened out with a new car. I also received no charges or tickets or anything from the accident, seems my bullshit worked for something üòé Except one of either the cops or the emts stole my microtech knife I had on me, but if that‚Äôs the price to pay, so be it.
Moral of the story is .......wear your seatbelt.... and if you get a weird feeling about something, go with it, it might save your life.

I‚Äôm not condoning getting high and driving, it happened. I don‚Äôt roll like that anymore anyways. I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt kill anyone or myself.

He was 28. He was on this sub every day as far back as his search history would go. He told my mom he wasn't an addict. He knew what he was doing. He was a ""smart user"". The thing is, we believed him. I constantly worried and wondered if there was such a thing as a casual heroin user. 

One day we invited him to join us, my parents, husband, sister and my kids to see this dinosaur show. He said a friend invited himto play disc golf but he'd meet us later. Later came, but he didn't. You can go through my post history and read more details of that time but I'll tell you it was pure hell. Sometimes for me the real kicker is the stupid dinosaur show was just a few blocks from where they found him, dead in his car. 

But I titled this post about 4 years later. 

My mom still cries every day. 

My grandmother can't leave the house these 4 days every year because she's so upset. 

4 years have passed and most of your stuff is still untouched in your bedroom.

The truth is time sometimes makes it worse. The realization the other day that some day I will have spent more of my life without you than with you brought me to tears. (yes that's 20+ years from now but still just the thought...) 

Mommy prays some day someone will come and say you fathered their child and that somehow there is still part of you here. This is what brings her hope. Can you believe that. 

Because it sucks finding you in numbers and ""share a coke"" bottles. It sucks finding you in pennies and butterflies and whatever else makes grieving people feel better. Mommy is the queen of this. Her entire house is a shrine of found things ""you"" sent her. 

The physical pain of her grief is all over her face. If there is a hell I believe you having to watch her suffer like this is worse than any fire and brimstone. 

Four years later and my memories of seeing you lying there in the casket are just as vivid as that day. I wish I didn't look. I wish that image was no where in my head. 

Sorry at some point this post turned to me talking to him. That's how I always feel when I come here. I'm also so emotionally drained and physically tired. Sorry for the jumbled nature of this post. 

If you're out there reading this and want to try to get clean, please go to the thing with your family. Go to whatever stupid thing it is because maybe it will be the decision that saves your life. If you think maybe your family doesn't care if you're there or not, they do care. They do. 

I share this every year because if I can inspire one person to go one more day without using then I feel like maybe he didn't die in vain. I don't know how else to use my grief to try to do good. I'm open to suggestions. What do you think he would want me to do?

acepld,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/acepld/this_doesnt_seem_right/,5,https://redd.it/acepld,Destralian,This doesnt seem right,"I've never used heroin before. The closest I've come is using Oxycodone once (can't remember dosage) and I never felt much from that. I decide to try heroin as an alternative for meth, and I know that sounds stupid when written like that but there is a little more thought behind it.

Anyway I get my stuff and I'm pretty cautious cause I don't know how strong it's going to affect me. I pour out a little bit of the powder, break it up with a card and I'm left with a tiny thin line of ""heroin"" . My plan was to very slowly take a bit to test out the waters and reach a comfortable high. Before snorting an amount like I originally intended to I decide to just try the smallest 2 or 3 little specs that have spilled out near the line. I'm talking absolutely tiny, miniscule specs. I thought I'd do them first and then 10 minutes later do more and slowly ease into it. In all honesty I wasn't even expecting to feel anything from them.

Within moments after snorting then I feel a bit panicky since it's my first time. I sit around working through it when I feel my body getting heavier. It feels sedated but I'm still mentally nervous. The rate at which it starts to come on causes me to worry a little more because despite having the smallest amount it's getting stronger.

I go out of my room and make myself a black coffee and I when I go to talk to my roommate I found myself slurring a few words. After drinking a few sips from my coffee I decide enough is enough and try a cold shower to calm down. I was feeling sleepy and groggy in a bad way so I was hoping it would wake me up a bit.

I end up deciding to get a lift to a nearby hospital. It's still getting stronger and my body feels very numbed. Then I feel pins and needles through my arms and it gets so intense that I struggle to even move them. They felt as though they were floating and locked in place. One of my hands was slightly raised above my leg yet it was just hanging as if it was magically being pulled upwards. At this point my breathing was rather manual. I had to try with as much effort as I could to inhale and despite really trying it felt like I was just getting half a mouthful of air in each time.

My point here is I realise that sedation is normal. Hell I almost even enjoyed the sensation in my arms... But all of that for a couple of specs of powder? 

Before arriving to the hospital which was about a 50 minutes drive away I decided to wait it out because it stopped increasing in intensity and I sat in the car for a while. From that point everything started to tone down. A few hours later and I'm left just feeling a bit tired and chilled. My body feels ever so slightly numb.

Let me mention that there really was no euphoria through any of this. Mentally I was panicking and whenever I'd calm down I'd suddenly feel extremely sleepy and I struggled to focus on my breaths which then jolted me awake a bit more. It felt like a fight to stay awake. With that being said the sensation in my arms was actually nice aside from it amplifying more and more in a way that seemed like it wouldn't stop.

Heroin was sold as #4 China white. It's fairly white too. Can it really just be that strong with me cause my tolerance is non existent? Why was there no euphoria? Should I test it for Fentanyl? The way I was feeling from the tiny amount I did makes me certain that if I just jumped into doing my intended amount I would has passed out and probably not woken up. Does anyone else have any similar experiences?


Tldr: 
-Tried the smallest spec of ""heroin"", felt the effects continue to intensify to a point where I could barely move my arms and breathing became a chore. Sat outside a hospital in a car and let it slowly wear off. This doesn't seem right. Can heroin be that potent or did I get something else?

anyhoo, i have 102 days clean today, and it‚Äôs honestly all thanks to methadone. i was always so hesitant to get on it bc my sister is on it and she def abuses the fuck out of it, but i had tried everything else to get clean and nothing would stick - rehab, subs, cold turkey, nothing.

i used almost everyday for 11 years, starting with oxy and moving on to dope. i just kind of resigned myself to dying eventually. my parents were a huge help in getting me started, even though they had their own reservations as well due to my sisters behavior. but my path of addiction was never like hers, so i figure my path of recovery doesn‚Äôt have to look like hers either.

i am so glad i started on methadone. i don‚Äôt know if i‚Äôll ever tell anyone besides my close family and boyfriend that i‚Äôm on it, just bc there is still such a huge stigma, and i don‚Äôt bring it up at meetings either, but it really has saved my life.

idk what the point of this post is. if anyone is having trouble getting clean and has the ability to try methadone, i would give it a shot. if you take advantage of the counseling that they offer and really try to use all of the resources that they have, it can be hugely beneficial. if anyone has any questions about getting started that aren‚Äôt super specific, i‚Äôll try to answer them if i can. i know every clinic must have their differences but i want to help if i can. i‚Äôve missed this community, it really helped me not to feel so alone when i was at my worst.

What would you IV users do? Im curious because boofing has a higher BA bioavailability then snorting so I'd think that a lot of people especially IVers would want that extra kick? Or would you just snort it and have to use more dope/wait for it all to kick in significantly longer???


Just curious!

I finally got some real fucking heroin for the first time in probably 2-3 fucking years. And figures it was in the town *NEXT* to the dope capital, lol!

I didn't want to fight, so I told her that I would go to the therapist. I have been to therapy before and it was a big waste of time and money.  Moreover, it took me years to bury my pain and hurt and I don't need someone digging it back up.
