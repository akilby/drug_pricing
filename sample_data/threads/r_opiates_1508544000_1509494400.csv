I’m more of a Oxy guy since I have a prescription due to nerve pain and chronic back pain. Anyways I was at a Walmart and before I went in, there was a girl who ran up to everyone and said she’s going to call the police because there was a guy behind the store with a needle in his arm and she was scared he was going to come and kill her since she saw him. She seemed super paranoid. I don’t know this guy, for all I know he was a bad person but since we all here do opiates, I could sympathize with him. So I sprinted to the back of the store, saw him just then standing up and told him “Hey dude you need to get out of here, some girl saw you and said she’s calling the police and going to get Walmart security on you, don’t shoot up in public” and after that he asked if I did anything and I told him only Oxy. He threw me a very small dime bag and said “This is thanks dude, have some happy nods tonight” and then he ran into his car and went off. Only bad thing was when I was about to go back into the store the girl from earlier was like “You helped him didn’t you? Why the fuck would you help a shitty person like him. You know all addicts are shitty people and shouldn’t be alive”. I seriously wanted to punch her but all I did was tell her to go fuck herself and try getting into his shoes, go shoot some H or even take 10mg of Oxy and we’ll see how you feel about addicts once you’re hooked. But anyways, went to the Walmart bathroom, hid the H in my shoes just incase and now I’m home and I’m not sure if I even want to snort it. I just feel like I’m going to jump even further down the rabbit hole. ",1508600704.0

1 week ago I stepped down from heroin to kratom, using gabapentin (for 3 days) and xanax (tapered till day 5).

Im now at a point where im getting chills and mild w/d symptoms when i wake up before i take my kratom dose (9-12g a day minimum).

I want off this opiate train, so my question is-- am i good to use gabapentin and xanax as i go off the kratom when ive only had 1 week off them (i would rather be addicted to opiates than either gabapentin or xanax tbh)

and should i throw loperamide in the mix-- or does this only delay some of w/ds similarly to kratom (in that there is still a base level of opiod dependence)

I will also have dextroamphetamine to combat the mental side effects of quitting-- however the physical symptoms have always been my greatest obstacle, especially the chills and restlessness

Does anyone know if the fent reaction would overpower the oxy reaction and turn the test orange?

I once tested an oxy/aspirin pill and it turned red for the aspirin, so I’m thinking the test will show whatever the brighter color is in a compound, which would be orange if you have a fent/oxy mix. I don’t know though so I’d appreciate input from anyone who has experience with this.

Has anyone tested a heroin/fent mix with the Mrquis before and if so, did you get purple or orange?

Went to a Walgreens to see how the pharmacy situation lookes in the back...  Spoke with the pharmacy tech, instantly knew nothing would amount from our engagement.. Kind of asked on how to take care of an insulin patient..  Who would soon be labeled 'Grampy' as I developed a story in my head and talked to the second pharmacy tech, summoned by the first, who put the nail in the coffin for me on scoring any rigs there. (He was the pharmacy tech/doc who teaches medicine administration.)  Just gave me the run around.

""Get in contact with you grandpa's personal physician to get help.""

Damn.

The next closest pharmacy is a CVS located in Target.

Lets do this.

I walk towards the pharmacy side of the store... I begin walking in and out of the isles several times to appear as if I can not find what I'm looking for..  Setting it up..

I step to the plate. (Counter)

There were 3 pharmacist working the area.  I spot the one I chose to engage with.  The target, must fit the description of a sweet, apathetic, smiling, person preferably female who would seem understanding to situations.  

All of the pharmacist's were females, win.

The role to play is that of someone expressing frustration, flustered, and even slightly confused, with an overall persona of courtesy and manners (smile's, please and thank you's).

My story:  I flew in from Colorado to tend to my grandpa for a few weeks while sister goes on vacation (the OG caretaker).  Good 'ol grampy is a... You guessed it.. Diabetic!

I told this lady that grampy sent me to get a few monitoring items for his disease.  Asking about testing strips, monitor, and of course the syringes.

In order to address these items nonchalant I asked about pricing's how he (grampy) would use it, brands, I would looked shocked at times due to some of the items pricing.. they legitimately are expensive..!  Even brought up how, and if, insurance could help cover the pricing on these item's..  Wound up setting up the ploy by purchasing the monitor and strips to cover needing the syringes, ultimately. The monitor was $17 and some change... The strips were $16 and some change, the rigs 2x $2.50 10 ct... I paid cash so I will most definitely be returning the monitor and strips tomorrow.

Goin' to go score a 30.

and I'm set for tomorrow when I return the monitor and strips. ;)

Thanks for the read y'all.  Maybe this could help some of y'all in a time of need.


P.S.  Of course dont attempt any of this while looking like a junkie...  Your odds will drastically decrease.  When I did bring up the syringes I did notice the nurse briefly looked at my arms.",1508559422.0

Pi day. Math nerds rejoiced, as I'm in a coma in ICU in a New Hampshire town I hadn't lived in for over a year. 

A few days earlier I had had enough. I was coming up on 7 months sober. 7 months of feeling every feeling and hyperfocusing on every thought. 

I sat on my sloppily made bed in a halfway house. The nicest halfway house in the city many said, as if I gave a shit then. When I showed up at the house my first day I thought this was it. I was going to finally give sobriery an honest attempt. 

I get a text, my friend wants to borrow 100 dollars. I know it's for dope. She lives in Dover, NH and took me in a couple years before in the middle of winter when I was sleeping in my car. I told her I would Western Union it in a little bit. Something about knowing the money was going to dope though switched a switch in my brain. Next thing I know, I'm on a train with everything I could pack in my bag. 7 months clean and today I will finally get some relief. 

I get picked up by her in Lawrence and we go cop. I get my 2 grams and we make the hour drive back to New Hampshire. I hadn't even asked her if I could stay there again. I guess I just assumed she would let me, and she did. I fucked up, but there's no turning back now. I lost my bed in the halfway, nowhere else to live, and a few grand in my bank. Might as well ride this out. 

I made it through the first 2 days, being responsible with tester shots. Then comes the third day. Im out of dope, as are my friends. So they arrange a ride to go score and are en route. So I'm back at the house with her boyfriend so we decide to kill some time. Go get a 12 pack and check out the record store for some cheap vhs tape to watch. Fugazi live tape, 50 cents, sounds good. 

Time flies, and next thing you know the tape is over, beer is gone, and dope is in hand. It must have been the alcohol which lead to my next poor decision to do a much bigger shot than normal. I do the shot. Then decide to go upstairs and lay down which was normal. I fell asleep, and for some reason this Ryan decides to check on me. He goes upstairs and I'm doing the death gargle. Panic ensues. They give me 4 hits or narcan to no avail. I now have two dudes and a girl dragging me down the stairs to the car. Accidentally dropped me and gashed my head, the doctors thought I had a broken neck. They drop me off at the hospital and I don't wake up til 5 days later with my parents in front of me in shock. They were told I had a 50/50 chance of having any functionality when I woke. I woke up totally normal. 

I barely knew the kid who decided to check on me. But if all this happened even 5 minutes later I wouldn't be here today. I just learned that he overdosed and passed away last night. I wish I could have been there to check on him. Just makes me wonder what I did to be lucky enough and why me and not him. 

Stay safe my friends. Don't use alone. 

Don't know why I wrote this all. I'm a terrible writer sorry.

IRT to PAWS I was a daily user of Opiates for 5 years (shooting for the last 6-9 months) before I got clean. The WD was horrendous. There's no denying just how fucking awful it is. Maybe I was lucky but the PAWS symptoms were negligible. There was some sleep issues for a few weeks and then I woke up early af for like a year (still do but that's a different issue) but aside from that I got lucky. I think I experienced RLS for a week (which was my worst WD symptom by far.)  

My sponsor came off a 2 gram a day habit along with suboxone and he experienced PAWS for 2 months or so.

I want to stress that your symptoms will improve quicker if you do something for yourself physically and mentally. I also want to stress that you should give yourself a break. Your body is quite literally relearning how to operate without drugs. Remember if you start using again you'll start back over in the cycle.

Which brings me to my point about triggers. I know for me I don't even think about the tools I used to do drugs as drug paraphernalia and it doesn't make me want to use. This comes with time of course, but don't think you'll never be able to buy foil again or a pen again without associating it with that action.

Again it comes with time and deliberate action to change your outlook and perspective but I'm here as living proof that people do change and we do recover.

I love you all.",1508537779.0

I'm not naive to the fact I'll probably smoke weed again being as its legal in my state. I just have to be responsible about it. 

I guess the point of my post is it can be done guys. If you're struggling to stay clean just keep your head up and keep trying. And know that there is so many different ways to get sober. Don't get discouraged if aa or na isn't for you. Just find what works for you and do it. I could have used many times this last 16 months and got away with it. I just chose to keep doing the right thing. Just remember you are what you tell yourself you are. If you think you can't get clean then you won't. If you have faith in yourself you can do anything.

There was no reason that I can remember calling, but that phone call change my life.  My father’s father died of pneumonia when I was 11 years old.  His mind deteriorated from Alzheimer’s first, and then he couldn’t walk.  Too much time in bed lead to bed sores and after something like 7 years of not knowing where he was pneumonia developed.  My sisters and I knew my father had aged and seemed different than he had been our whole lives.  He never gave us a straight answer, and my mom denied anything was happening.

“Momma, what’s wrong with Poppa?”

“Hmmmmm….. What do you mean?”

“You know what I mean.  He’s different.  Does he have Alzheimer’s?”  The background noise of indiscriminate words and voices on the TV came over the line in her silence.  She thought for a moment more, before she responded,

“I’ll let you ask him yourself.  Let me get him.”  A few moments later I heard her say, “Kelly.  It’s Riley.  He wants to ask you something.”

“Riley?  How are you?”  The kindness in his voice proved to me that something was different with him.  For years both of them always sounded so disappointed with me, and there was no reason why they wouldn’t be now.  He spoke softer and sweeter, like he didn’t remember the trouble I always caused them or maybe didn’t care anymore.  My insides braced for what I was about to hear.

“Good.”  I choked, and my eyes twitched.

“What’s up?”

“Poppa, what’s wrong with you?”  There was no easy way to ask the question.

He laughed like he always did when things got serious or emotional.  “How can you tell something’s wrong?”

“I just can.  You’re not the same.  What is it?”

“I have had Parkinson’s disease for a few years now.”  The words broke me in half.  For more than a decade I tried to kill him by killing myself and had finally achieved success, but now that I finally had everything I thought I ever wanted, I didn’t want it anymore.  He couldn’t hear me cry because the wind was knocked out of me, and I didn’t know what to do, so I did drugs for the next few weeks trying to make it go away.

Before I turned the lights off and went to bed 2 weeks later, I threw my ranch bible off my bed and onto the floor.  It was too much for me to believe even if I wanted to.  Creation.  A flood.  Parting the Red Sea.  Fire and brimstone. The dead coming back to life. The resurrection and all the rest of it. “If God wanted me to believe the bible,” I thought, “Then, why did he make it a f***ing story book?” Those were the exact words in my head as I pushed the ember of my cigarette butt straight down into the ashtray and twisted. I pulled the chain on my reading lamp and fell back onto the bed, pulling the covers over my shoulder.  Christ wasn’t real, and he sure couldn’t save me.

I struggled to sleep for those weeks and woke up in the middle of the night thinking that I was being stabbed to death a few hours after I threw my bible onto the floor.  The bible was too much to believe, but my desperation overrode my disillusioned disposition long enough for me to pick it up off the floor.  I turned to psalms to comfort me in place of the chemicals my brain and body were accustomed to, because the psalms were short, easy passages.  I read psalm 120.  Verse six says, My soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace, and I thought to myself that it sounded appropriate for my life of running with the devil and hurting everyone.

I moved onto the next psalm, and the first verse of it completed a high voltage circuit inside of my head and heart.  It was instantly clear to me that my life had been supernaturally saved by an almighty and all wise God.  As surely as I breathe and write this, more certainly than my name is Riley Chapman I know that I received eternal life and salvation.  The power and life and the miracle that took place inside of me dwarfed the supernatural acts I so doubted in the bible.  The waters of the Red Sea parting and turning water to wine and even creation itself could not compare to the glory at work inside of my chest and head.  God wrote those scriptures for me and to save me, before time ever was and waited an eternity for me to find them. He called my name, and that was it.  It was finished.

Now the next morning there was only one thing crazier than the fact that Jesus Christ was the Lord of creation, and that he paid for my life of hostility towards him with his own death and that his life was now being lived in me.  The only thing crazier than all that the day after I got saved was myself.  My apartment on Foster continued to stink, and different dealers or alcoholics or junkies stopped by every day to see me or my roommate.  I smoked as many cigarettes as I could every day and all my clothes smelled like the fryer grease at the burger joint until I quit because of the drugs people did at work.

I hung out with Faith every day after that.  She inspired me to live a life of holiness by her own steadfast devotion to God and the word.  She showed me what life in him could look like, and that it was cool and fun.  We lived a few blocks away from each other and spent our days listening to music or at the park with her dog.

Everyone always said that we were a good fit for each other, but attraction did not exist between us.  She was my friend, and I was hers.  We spent all our time together.  We worked out together.  We ate together.  I even washed dishes at the Greek restaurant where she served tables, and our Greek boss commented that I would make a baby come out of her one day.  It wasn’t what I wanted, but I prayed to God that if it was his will then he would have to turn my heart towards her.

I tried to quit smoking 8 times before I succeeded while Faith started smoking for the first time in 3 years.  There were roommates coming and going at the apartment doing drugs or drinking, and my mom still paid the rent for some reason.  She could tell something changed in me and felt happy to help since I was doing so well.  Faith loved working at the ranch and ministering to the women there, but she lost her job over the cigarettes that she started smoking with me.


July of 2013 became the first month of my life without cigarettes, marijuana or any drugs.  It was hard to believe that my life changed like that, and that it was so easy.  The chains of drug addiction and violence had me bound for over a decade by then, and on my birthday a leader in the Church publicly exhorted me for the obvious change in my life at a Friday night potluck.  I wept for God’s grace on my life at 27 years old.  

In August I moved out of the apartment on Foster and moved into a discipleship house several blocks away.  It was fall by then, and they found the dead body of one of Faith’s best friends.  He graduated the ranch, and Faith knew him for years before and after she came to Christ so her testimony was paramount in his decision to go through the program.  The untimely and self-inflicted death of a close friend hurts, especially if you were supposed to be with him the moment he did his last injection and died cold and alone by the river.

Faith forgot to call him when she went to Monday night service.  They were supposed to go together, and besides that she blamed herself for smoking cigarettes and not being the shining testimony he expected her to be when he got out of the ranch even though he never blamed her.

Unexpected emotion came over me at our friend’s house as she wept and slept wrapped in a blanket next to me on the couch.  There was an overwhelming desire to take care of her, to protect her, and I felt like I loved her as something more than a friend for the first time.  I wanted to wipe away her tears.  I wanted to hold her.

I first confessed it to her over lunch at a Mexican restaurant with our friend.  She wouldn’t look up from her plate and shook her head after she told me to stop.  It was right after she told us that she was moving to Spokane for beauty school in an attempt to deal with our friend’s death.  I knew she would fight me, but I knew she needed me even though she never admitted it and said she didn’t want me.  No one knew her like me.  No one loved her like me.

My parents paid for me to fly home about 6 months after I got saved.  It was at Christmas time, and my mother’s whole family went to eat at Clancy’s.  Our grandmother and her boyfriend sat at the head of the big table by me, and I pretended to understand what the deaf old man was talking about. I had no idea.  Right before the main course was served up, I turned my chair away from them. I hadn’t thought much of it for the last 8 years, but I had been gone and lost and dead in so many ways. Here I was after all of it like I never left, and no one seemed to notice the significance of it. I turned my chair and wept like a man wrongly imprisoned and finally returned to his family. It wasn’t wrongful, but it was a prison inside of my mind and inside of myself like that. Now I was free, and all I could do was weep for the mercy and grace upon my life.

But she lives at my moms place and uses her car (and had numerous accidents but hopefully not too bad, that said I’m afraid she is going to kill herself and/or kill someone in the process.) this is not it: my mom gives her money whenever my sis “needs “ it (oh and she’s living at my moms place has everything free besides the drugs and my mom seems not to give a fuck if she uses at her place. I’m so afraid she will die (she’s 37 kilos for 1m65) and also that she might kill someone/herself while driving. I keep telling my mother she’s enabling my sister drug use because she keeps giving/lending her money for drugs but nothing seems to ring a bell for my mother: Reddit fam, any suggestions?

I just want to start this by saying sorry for the shitpost, but it's just what happens when you can't get your fix.

They're cut straight from the foil pill tray, so they're not fakes. The only way I can get high from Oxys is if I have some instant releases, there's a brand called Shortec here in the UK that's does the job every time.

I discovered early on that they have an addiction problem. In their case, it's an addiction to Oxycontin. 

I have a good income. This person comes from modest circumstances. I've been generous. Money doesn't mean much to me. But even though I'm generous this person's need for money seemed off to me. I confronted them. I said addiction didn't matter. They fessed up.  

Early on they told me they were a functioning addict. They hold a job. They have quit many times. What was once a once or twice a week thing had become an everyday thing. They said they were buying Suboxone to get them off the Oxycontin. 

They said that they take the Suboxone and cut it up. They taper off of it.  They said it was not that hard. That I thought their problem was worse than it was. 

Now, they say they are clean. They aren't on anything. Yet, the need for cash hasn't gone away. I'm suspicious. I said I get that recovery isn't easy and that I would support them even if there are setbacks.  Once after they quit I found a piece of foil with burned marks on it in their house. They said it was old. I have 0 experience with drugs of any kind but I'm not stupid either. 

They insist they are clean and that I need to trust them. 

I want to trust them but at the same time I'm afraid that I'm supporting a drug habit.

My oxy guy moved out of town and while this doesnt set me with WD problems due to my relatively minor codeine habit with oxy as a nice treat when I have the spare $, it still bummed me out as finding a pharma connect here is HARD (Oceania).

With free time after work and money to burn I thought id try my hand at a cold cop. All the classic tips such as a hoodie, cigarettes and a willingness to immerse myself in another world. I take the train from the city to the neighbourhood I found on google to have the most notorious opiate problem (which ironically is like 3 stops from the city centre). This place proved incredibly curious yet unsettling. A northern part of a well known major neighbourhood comprising of all levels of socioeconomic demographics. I found a bustling main street fimmled with nice restaurants, bars, families and well dressed adolescents heading out for the night. The only difference I saw to my relatively nice neighbourhood being spottin the occasional syringe or group of homeless looking individuals walking with purpose. Safe to say so far my search for opioids hadnt yet been fruitful.

All it took was a right turn and 50 metre walk towards the housing estates towering behind the main road. I pull out a smoke and light. Within 30 seconds im approached by a gentlemen who asks me for a smoke, pinned pupils and all the good signs. I ask if he knows anyome who cops pills, oxy, morphine, etc nearby. Nope. But he sells the best heroin around apparently! Have a quick chat to the (likely chemically enduced) bubbly and joyful man before parting ways. I walk further towards the housing estates and into the criss crosses of the walkways and passages found within, accumulating a few more of the aforementioned interactions. I find an easily visible bench near a machine where one can (as I found find out) procure free syringes and thought it a good spot to have a couple cigarettes and lie in wait. I proceeded to have quite a surreal half hour with a number of individuals passing by, stopping and having a sit with the cigarette dispensary I had become. Time after time all I was offered was gear. And actually meth on one occasion LOL. I never thought I would find myself on a bench having a conversation with a 17 year old kid called ""the spider"", a guy who must have been over 60 and a woman who was more greatful for my cigarettes than I had ever seen. A couple guys shooting up not even 25 metres away and a father who had come to the needle dispensary with his little boy as if it was just another day for both of them. To top this off on my way back towards the main street a middle aged, short vietnamese man with an old lady trailing him with a satchel looked at me briefly as I walked and muttered ""what you after?"". This bloke looked like he worked at an office or something, some ID card around his neck with a dress shirt and a tie. Turns out he also had heroin caps ""better than oxy"" apparently but I once again politely declined and moved on.

I found this all so surreal. These were all friendly people, some a bit too high maybe but none with whom I felt even the slightest bit afraid around. And I live in a neighbourhood where a homeless person is an absolute rarity yet alone heroin around the corner. I also found the fact that all I would have had to do in any of those moments was pull out my 50 and say Sure to have some heroin in my pocket. For someone whos DOC is mainly codeine this was all baffling.

In the end I didnt get any oxy or morphine. But I did grant one of the many guys a smoke who proceeded to pull out a Xanax bottle and give me 8mg for 20! So thats something I guess!! Will be doing some with a gross tasting 600mg dose of codeine tonight and lay back haha.

77z795,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/77z795/my_friend_died/,75,https://redd.it/77z795,FashionablyFake,My friend died.,"I've had so many friends die over the years, it's not even much of a shock anymore when it happens. But for some reason, this one has really gotten under my skin. 

We weren't even really that close... we trusted each other completely, which is rare in this game, but for the most part he was a using friend and not much more. He'd swing by my house and pick up my money, go and pick up, and when he dropped it off for me he'd always hang out while I did my shot just in case, because he knew I always used alone and didn't want anything to happen to me. 

He had a wife and a 3 year old daughter named Kaia and a month before he died he and his wife learned that they were having another child. He couldn't get clean and so he kept on using and he died alone, and his child will never know its father, and Kaia will most likely not remember him at all when she gets older. He's just... gone. Like his life meant absolutely fucking nothing. 

Why do we do this shit? If you think about it, like really think about it, what's the fucking point? I know why I use, and it's the same reason why a lot of people do: we can't handle reality, we can't handle our minds, we can't handle our emotions, and we can't handle ourselves. But when did we decide that life was cheap enough to throw away? 

I'm not saying that I think that my life is precious or worth anything, and I actually wouldn't really be upset if I died right now, but it's just baffling to me that we deal with this on a daily basis. Dusty is dead. His wife is alone. His daughter won't remember him, and his unborn child will never know him. And for what? So he--and we-- can stick a piece of metal into our arms and feel human for a brief amount of time. And when another person dies we shake our heads and cluck our tongues and say what a waste and what a shame it is, and then we go and do another shot because we've completely forfeited the right to have our lives be worth anything more than the cost of a bag or a bundle. 

Despite how this post reads, I don't actually have a strong desire to stay alive. But I wish that I lived the kind of life where death is an anomaly, where it means something, instead of the life of a hopeless junkie to whom death is pedestrian and so commonplace that we stop being shocked and affronted by it. 

I just keep picturing him prepping his shot, maybe rushing because he had to pick up his daughter from day care, or drop his wife off at work, and thinking he'd have the time to do whatever it was that he had to do and not knowing that those were the last few seconds he had on earth. 

It's so fucked up. I'm so angry with all of us for living the kind of life that takes the meaning out of being alive. 

If you think about all the energy that goes into raising someone, all the years and years of nurturing a person to adulthood, and then it's all gone in the blink of an eye for literally no fucking reason... Addiction is life boiled down to nothingness. It's all the blood and sweat and tears of loving someone just come to nothing in the end. What the fuck's the point of ever loving anyone if they can just be snatched away in the time it takes for you to take a breath? 

Fuck it. I learned this lesson long ago, I'm just surprised that it's affecting me this way right now. 

Also funny/ironic thing--first time I met Dusty he gave me a couple free bags because it was the anniversary of my fiance's death and I could only afford to get one and he felt bad for me. Death always comes full circle.

Rabies concentrates itself in the saliva and nervous system of its hosts, thereby, causing its host to infect others with the virus through biting.  Interestingly it seems to have an intelligent strategy in spreading itself from its hosts to others.  The facts associated with different kinds of super bugs, hemorrhagic fever and the disproportionate number of white women from the states of Texas and California having Morgellon’s disease fascinate me.  Recreational research of diseases can be fun, but first-hand experiences with them are not.  I have had Hepatitis C, multiple abscesses, one infected deep vein thrombosis, cellulitis in my arm and what may have been sarcoptic mange once, but the worst disease I ever had was my own self.  It was even worse than the time MRSA devoured my spine and that epidural abscess almost crushed it.

When Angie, Cade and I got off the bus, we scored 3 20-dollar balloons of heroin first thing from a guy outside of Powell’s bookstore.  It was Saturday night, and drunken college students littered the sidewalks outside of the bars in the night.  Cigarette smoke and slurred conversation filled the air and came from people who had no idea what life was like for my kind.  They would go back to their beds in their apartments after spending 100 dollars at the bar.  I would sleep on the cold concrete in one of the doorways down the street with my head inches from the puddles they would tromp their stylish leather shoes through on the way home.

We all split up, and I lost my piece of heroin in a Pita Pit bathroom.  The bars closed when I found Cade and tried to sleep on the pavement next to him.  Unlike the place we came from, we did not know the ins and outs of homelessness in this new place.  We had played like kids on a jungle gym in the city we lived in before but didn’t even know where to find cardboard to sleep on.

Angie found us in the morning, and we got high one more time before we parted ways for good.  I lived at the Joyce while my parents paid the rent, because I promised them that I was taking every possible step to get into a place called Hooper detox.  Truthfully, I had never been there or even called, and I wasn’t taking any steps to get in.

I paid 50 something dollars a night, but I told them it cost 80 and used the extra to buy heroin.  The dive from paying 20 bucks for 300 milligrams of morphine on pill hill in the Tenderloin to the 20-dollar mouse turds of mediocre heroine I bought from the guy on the 3rd floor of the Joyce was hard to stomach.  It never gave me what I wanted, and I was sick by 4 every morning.  I did a lot of rinses to pass the time and injected some ashy water in my forearm on afternoon.

That night I got cotton fever.  It started like always with sweaty chills and severe bone and muscle aches.  My head pounded and the shakes steadily grew with a kidney pain.  The shakes turned into jerking convulsions and lifted me off the bed like Linda Blair.  I puked on the floor and sheets.  My mouth and throat parched till my lips stuck together.  I cried for water.  I tried to drink and wretched it all back up a second later.  I puked and pooped in the common shower down the hall.  My head and kidneys hurt so bad I cried and puked some more.  I did not sleep.  “At least Ebola kills you.” I thought to myself as the sun came up.  CNN showed Gaddafi bloodied and beaten by his enemies.  He had been captured in Libya.

My parents sent the money for the day, and the dealer had to make change in his room after he gave me the 20-dollar balloon.  While I cooked up my hit, a pebbly slime rose in my chest, and I almost peed my pants.  I grabbed the small trashcan to pee into and puked into it simultaneously.  A large squirt of diarrhea ran down my leg, and it took a second to collect myself, before I did the shot.  My dealer met me in the hallway with the 60 dollars for rent on my way to the shower.  

After the shower, I watched TV for a while and tried to relax.  When I went to pay rent at the front desk I realized that I had left the money in the bathroom.  It was gone, and I told management that I had to go pick up another Western Union at Safeway.  My dad yelled at me over the phone about having to send more money.

I wore the only thing in my room that wasn’t plastered with excrement, a pair of pajama pants, completely ripped from the crotch and down the leg and no underwear.  It was cold and the 10 blocks back to Safeway were embarrassing while I tried to keep the thin, ripped fabric from exposing my private parts on the street.  I waited two hours for the money, but when I returned to the Joyce management kicked me out for finding a syringe under my bed and the smell coming out of the trashcan.  They seemed to think that I was defecating in it.  The front desk clerk, an inadequate type with thick rimmed glasses, a skinny neck and a buzz cut, told me about finding an overdosed body in one of the rooms last week and gave me a pair of jeans that were too small.  The pink and white frosting on my animal cookies provoked my guts to gurgling again while I listened.  Perhaps, the treat was a bit premature.    

       For the next three mornings, I walked to the MAX in the dark and took the red line to the Rose Quarter.  Being new to town, I thought it seemed like an amazing place to live.  It was progressive and of a size somewhere between a town and a city.  It boasted one of the top public transit systems in the nation.  Everyone bought their milk and eggs from the farmer’s markets and rode retro fixed gear bikes with skinny tires and smoked weed.  However cool of a place it was to live, I still slept outside, and it would never be that cool for me.  

       But at least I was finally fulfilling my promise to my parents about trying to get into the detox, and I slept in an asphalt parking lot with a jacket over my legs through the cold nights.  Hooper took me in on the third morning, but the day before that, my arm turned into a thick piece of oak firewood, hard and swollen and excruciating.  The ER at Good Samaritan Hospital told me it was cellulitis, and when I first got there the doctors and nurses sneered at the smell in the room.  Fish scales of hardened, dead skin covered the soles of my feet from the black and white Adidas I found and had worn for weeks without socks.

The medical detox at Hooper was easy for me, except that no amount of washing my feet helped.  It became an unsettling stench that started light, but the longer I sat in any one place, everyone had to ask, “What is that smell?  Whoah!  What is that?”  I watched movies, ate graham crackers and drank milk, until they gave out Trazodone at eight p.m.  After seven days I took my last two milligrams of buprenorphine and left three days later to a sober living facility called the 8x8.

Men and women who had struggled with addiction or alcoholism lived in the tiny rooms of the 8x8.  Each room had a kitchenette and toilet.  The city paid our rent so long as we attended five meetings a week and stayed sober.  I lived on the sixth floor, and all but one girl on the floor had already relapsed.

My first two weeks there something in my spine hurt like I never hurt before, and I took 24 IB profens every six hours to sleep.  My stomach bled inside from the pills, and everyone said that I should go to the ER.  I refused to go but moaned and wailed loudly every night in the lobby of the 8x8.  The black lady who worked the front desk at night couldn’t stand it or me for that matter.  It was easily the worst pain of my entire life, and when my mom came to visit me on Thanksgiving Day, she said,

“No one’s face looks like yours does, that doesn’t need to go to the hospital.”

We took a taxi to Good Samaritan to see what they said.  It was my idea that after the CT scan I would go smoke a cigarette, but they said,

“You have infected discs in your back, and it looks like some vertebral osteomyelitis.  That’s infected bone.  We’ll get you up to a room as soon as we can and start a round of antibiotics now.  I was going to give you some dilaudid, but your mother says you’re a recovering addict, so we’ll stick with Percocet, ten milligrams every 6 hours.”

“Um.  So, can I go smoke now?”

“No.   I’m sorry.”

I needed a cigarette.  Ten milligrams of Percocet every five minutes couldn’t touch my tolerance or the pain.  My back hurt, and I thought my mom should have minded her own business.

“Well, Momma, you know what I think, right?”

“No.  What do you think, Riley?”

“F*** this s*** show is what the f*** I think!  Just a bunch of stupid mother***ers around here!”  I reminded myself of Buffalo, and the doctor shrugged before she walked out of the room.  “Mother f***er!”


On the third floor of the hospital my mom brought me Thai food and several bottles of IB profen, but it wasn’t long before the doctors discovered the IB profen and took it from me.  They said 4800 milligrams every six hours was not good for me, even if it was the only thing that worked.  Later that night I chased my mom out of the room, slammed the door and threw my dinner tray on the floor, so the doctors wrote me an order for three milligrams of liquid morphine.  It didn’t work, and they seemed surprised that I wasn’t more thankful.

The next afternoon I got an EKG to see if I had vegetative growths on my heart valves, otherwise known as endocarditis.  If I did, things were worse than I could imagine, but while the tech and his helper ran a piece of cold metal through the slime on my chest, one of my friends from the 8x8 showed up with some heroine.  I demanded to use the bathroom, and after a minute I pulled my friend into the bathroom in front of the technicians and locked the door.  We took 15 minutes to fix, so the nurse knocked and made me, “COME OUT OF THERE, NOW!”

At one a.m. a few days later my legs tingled and quit working so well.  I couldn’t use the bathroom, so a middle aged blonde woman came in and gave me a catheter.  The night doctor ordered another MRI.  I could not even move my feet an inch by the time they rolled me down the hall.  My blood pressure skyrocketed, and in the morning my regular doctors came to see me.  The Asian one asked me if I thought four milligrams of dilaudid would be enough, or if I wanted more.  To make my point about not drug seeking I asked for two milligrams, and I cried.

I told the anesthesiologist in the OR,

“I’ve never had surgery before.”

“Well, you’ll be fine, sweetie.  Can you count from 100 backwards for me?”

“100……99…….98……97….96…95…….”

I woke up to feel the warmth of the fentanyl evaporating and sweaty desperation forming on my brow.  There were new pains in my back from where the surgeon laid open the meat and used power tools to cut into my vertebra and sowed a seam of fishing line through the skin over my spine.  A pretty x-ray tech slid a cold metal case behind me shortly after I woke up, and I screamed.  Different nurses brought me dilaudid and morphine every few hours.  After five days of sleepy agony, I slid out of bed and used my walker and arms to get my first shower with my mom’s help.
Before I left a lady used a sonogram to run a thin rubber tube through a vein in my arm into my heart called a PICC line.  It was painless, and I was never supposed to mess with it for fear of infection or affecting my heart.  A mesh band held the capped nozzle against the skin of my upper arm, and a week after the surgery my mother helped move me into an assisted living facility.  

I shuffled with my walker everywhere I went.

It took me fifteen days before I could walk unassisted, and my own toes only tripped me up occasionally.  23 days after surgery I had my first bowel movement and had not gone for several days before that.  The resident doctor at the retirement home stopped in to see me.


“How are you doing?”
“Good.  What happened to your arm, Doc?”

“I had a skiing accident.  It’s okay though.  I’ll be out of this sling in a few weeks.  How are you doing coming off of the dilaudid?  When was your last dose?  Let’s see…..”

“Um.  I think yesterday morning.  I think I feel okay.  You know?  I mean the doctor at the hospital told me that a lot of people think child birth or kidney stones are the most painful things a person can go through, but she said that’s because epidural abscesses are so rare.”

“Yeah.  That’s for sure.  I can’t imagine what that’s like, but you say you feel okay for now without the dilaudid?”

“Yeah, Doc.  I’m feeling okay.”

“Good.  Well I’m going to get a drug test from you.  Let the nurse know when you are ready to pee.”

The surprise of a drug test made me paranoid, so I saved a bottle of pee in a bottle in case they ever gave me another one.  It was more boring and comfortable in the retirement home than the streets, but it was as sad.  The eerie stink and dread of leather skinned shadows leaked into the hallway while they waited for death in their rooms.  Sometimes I caught glimpses of straight faced families staring at the floor and sitting around the grey skeleton of their grandfather in bed, his mouth open, his eyes absent, a tangle of tubes and wires running from him to softly beeping machines.  The swollen-eyed nurses lost two or three patients a week.

The retirement home wanted to send me home after six weeks of antibiotics, but I wasn’t ready to give up my PICC line or hospital bed or cable TV or the morphine, so I demanded that they send me back to Good Samaritan for an MRI.  The results showed that my spine had only deteriorated since I arrived at the facility, and the doctor wrote me orders for six mg of dilaudid every four hours and upped my morphine besides adding Ativan, as needed.

An old, orange lady who I called Garfield and a young African immigrant took care of my meds, and I kept them under my tongue until I got back to my room, where I administered them to myself through my PICC line.  Whenever I took a shower I used a plastic card to try scraping the crocodile skin on the bottoms of my feet, and at night I snuck out of my window and walked down to a trailer park to buy meth or heroine.

My nurses all knew I was high but couldn’t figure out how I got it, and the administrators gave me a drug test when the maid found blackened spoons in my bathroom. When they gave me the cup, I used the old urine I saved from before.  One of the administrators came to see me the next day.

“So, Mr. Chapman, when those results come back from the lab, you’ll be out of here.”  Her tone conveyed disgust and rejoicing at the prospect of my expulsion.  I was on my second round of antibiotics after the first ones didn’t work.

“Okay.  Well, aren’t you sending it to a lab?”

“Yes.”

“So, you’ll know what’s in my system, right?  You’ll be able to know if it was heroin or morphine, right?”

“Exactly. We’ll know you were doing heroin and you’ll be gone.”

“No.  I won’t.”

“Yes, you will, and then you’ll probably die of the infection.  Do you have anything to say for yourself, after throwing away your life like this?”

“Yeah, I do.  Get the f*** out of my room and leave me the f*** alone until you have those results!  I’m watching cartoons!”

She didn’t have a response, but she left.  I got caught smoking cigarettes in my room at night by one of the nursing assistants, but got away with it.  Joints were harder to smoke, but I smoked them in the room too.  They knew I used my PICC line to inject my painkillers, because it ballooned out where I clogged it and had to be replaced.  All but one of the nurses hated my guts and wanted to get rid of me.  The one who didn’t hate me spent extra time in my room watching Comedy Central Roasts and went to the store to buy me every flavor of Laffy Taffy.  She talked to me about sex with her boyfriend and how he didn’t love her like she loved him.  Other nurses would make up reasons to come into the room and check my charts or IV pump when she lingered awkwardly talking to me.      

Back home my family expected me to die, so my father visited to boost my spirits and maybe spend some of our last time together.  I didn’t know that’s what they thought, but my father had concluded from everything he heard that I would be lucky to live.  We watched my new favorite movie Drive with Ryan Gosling and Brian Cranston when he came, and he brought a king cake for the nurses.  At Buffalo Wild Wings we split a six piece of wings and an appetizer of spinach dip, which was different.  I always ate a lot of food and quickly, but the regimen of dilaudid and morphine and the hospital bed suppressed my appetite.  My stomach had shrunk so that I could barely eat, and he attributed my lethargy and lightheadedness to anemia.  He made me get my haircut and beard shaved off.  When I got back to the home, an older nurse said, “Boy!  You got me all turned on, and I’m black!”      

Over the phone he told me what tests to make the doctors run and what numbers were good or acceptable and what was bad.  We watched the numbers of my erythrocyte sedimentation rate closest and felt relieved when it went down.  He saved my life for the umpteenth time, and after three months they let me go with an envelope of 12 dilaudid and a few prescriptions to be filled in New Orleans.

I gave the nurses one last headache when I snuck out of the facility with my PICC line in.  One nurse wanted to take it out, but I told her the next nurse on shift would.  When the next nurse came on I told her the one before had already taken it out, and I left in a hurry.  The muscles burned in my atrophied body, and I wheezed all the way to the bus stop.  If there was ever an appropriate time to refrain from smoking cigarettes this was it, but I smoked at least three Camel 99s before I made it four blocks to the bus stop.  In the airport bathroom, I mixed up 24 milligrams of dilaudid and pushed it down my PICC line, but my body only tingled for a second.  Then I felt like nothing but sober.  

Between flights my dad called me,

“Seems they have a big brouhaha over at the old folks’ home you were living in.”

“Really?  How do you know that?”

“Well, they called us, pretty frantic.  Did you get out of there with your PICC line in?”

“Yeah.  I still have it in.”

“S***!  Riley!”

“It’s okay.  I’ll take it out myself.”

“I don’t know about that.  I think that’s dangerous.  Let’s figure it out when you get here.”

“Okay.  Sounds good.  We’re about to take off.”  I walked to the aircraft’s bathroom, and it moved in my heart and through my chest as I pulled two feet of thin tubing out of my arm.  It was probably a biohazard, and I thought about that before disposing of it in the waste bin.


My luggage got lost on the plane, but a man delivered it all by three a.m.  There were a few morphine pills in my bags, so I took them as soon as they showed up.  In the morning my mom took me to get my dilaudid prescription filled, but since it was from Oregon they would only fill the morphine and Ativan, no dilaudid.  I refused to get the morphine filled as some sort of self-destructive protest but insisted on the Ativan.  An old roach from one of my parents’ parties gave me a head change, before my sisters took me to eat lunch at Frankie and Johnny’s.  

My sisters kept looking down and putting their hands over their eyes when I talked to the waitress.  They said, “Come on, Riley!  Stop!”
They found my attitude and tone appalling.  The younger one laughed at the effects of marijuana on my eyes mixed with the onset of severe opiate withdrawals on my body, slowly turning into a broken slinky.  At the house, my sisters tried to watch Bridesmaids with me, but I passed out during the part where they got food poisoning.

I woke up in the bed on the third floor, but I thought I must have showered with my clothes on and got right into bed at some point in the night and forgot about it.  My sheets were dripping wet.  I dreamed of swimming.  Streaks of brown clay lined the white tile in the bathroom by the toilet, but I didn’t remember getting up before then.  I snuck downstairs and stole 14 dollars out of my mom’s purse and her car keys.  I guzzled half a bottle of red cough syrup even though I knew it wouldn’t do anything for me.

At a Chevron, the crack head riding with me jumped out to see if she could get me some brown for 14 bucks.  The guys in the car had some but they wanted 40 dollars.  She told me to drive to a few other places in Pigeon town and jumped out to check inside of different houses.  I swerved to one last house, and while she was in the house my guts shook.  My sphincter quivered.  An untied leather boot turned itself around inside of me and tried to push itself through my throat before I puked up bile and red cough syrup, all over the interior of my mother’s Mercedes Benz.  I opened the door and slid out of the vehicle into the street to pull down my pants.  An aerosol of thin liquid sprayed the pavement and the backs of my shoes.  A trickle ran down my legs, and my vomit gushed onto the pavement in the middle of the ghetto before the sun came up.  This went on for a few minutes before I gave up on the woman coming back and left.  She could have the 14 bucks.  

I continued to vomit on myself and didn’t even try to keep my bowels under control on the drive home.  “I’m going to die.  I’m going to die.”  I repeated to myself between retching and the expulsion of bile from my mouth and warm liquid spreading across the seat of my pants.

My father met me at the front door.  He knew I stole the car and some money, but most of all he knew I was going to die from this sickness if I didn’t get to the hospital.  My mother drove, and my father sat with me in the back seat.  They wheeled me to the ER where I talked the doctor into giving me some water.  My dad told her not to give me water, and I puked it up like he said I would.  Soon I was on the gurney in convulsions, in and out of consciousness.

“I’m about to s***!”  I managed to gurgle to my dad and the orderly through the vomit.  The orderly and my dad hooked the back of my knees with their arms and pulled me up to slide the bedpan under me.
A doctor came in and belittled me for letting them put me on so much medicine in Portland.  I would have cursed him out, but it was too hard to talk and puke and convulse at the same time.  He wrote an order for some dilaudid to abate the vomiting and diarrhea until I could get enough fluids to not die.  I had only been home for 36 hours, but I had already stolen my mom’s car, 14 bucks from her purse, drank a half bottle of cough syrup, puked it up all over the interior of her Mercedes Benz, soiled the seats, tried to score drugs in the ghetto and was currently puking and pooping to death on a gurney at seven in the morning.  This was exactly why I had not been home for the last three years.

They let me out before I ever had a solid stool, which my dad said was wrong, and the following week I went to visit my father’s mother, Turkey.  I got a hold of some 30 milligram Oxy and needed money, so I set up a visit with Turkey.  He took me to eat at Popeye’s.  It had been over three years since I had seen him.  His bottom eyelids hung loose from his eyeballs, and he used a cane.  He was much older than I had ever known him to be.  I asked him for money, and he asked me why I needed it.  We both knew I was lying, but he gave me a few bucks before he left.

My parents could only have me home for a few weeks before they insisted that I enter a yearlong rehab called Bridge House.  It was free and boasted an extremely high success rate among its graduates.  I told my parents that I wasn’t using, even though I would disappear for hours and get caught lying about where I was.  My sister caught me bouncing (falling asleep and waking up 40-50 times a minute, while standing) one night, and I shared a needle at one of the gas stations with a random.  Seals and Croft played on the radio, and beads of sweat rolled down my cheeks.   Summer breeze makes me feel fine, blowing through the jasmine in my mind.  

I knew I contracted HIV from it and went into Bridge House a few days later.  In one week I smoked my carton of Camel filters and got caught up in some commotion involving a guy called Long Beach threatening to stab another client with a pair of scissors.  We took off together.  A few days later my mom bought me a ticket back to Portland.  I don’t know what they thought I would do there, but at least I would be far away.

I recently acquired a vial of 50mg/1ml dilaudid and popped my cherry with the stuff. In Australia, at least where i live, its relatively difficult to come across pharmaceutical opiates. I was over the moon, but it also presented an opportunity to gauge how strong the H Im getting is compared to the stuff you guys get in the US. Having a baseline is important for any comparison, despite how unscientific this one will be..

I usually IV 1gram of street gear and barely catch a nod. If I want to nod i'll need a touch of benzos, or around 1.3g. When i got the dilaudid, I was careful to start low, with 10units = 5mg. Didnt feel much, so did 10mg a bit later, started to feel that rush but it wasnt that strong. The next day I did a shot which was around 14mg and it was still comparable to under a gram of my usual H. By then I was running out so i needed to space out my doses until I could get more H, putting an end to this little experiment. If i had to guess, it would be around 18mg which would put me in nod-land. 

So my question is, for those experienced in both smack and hydromorphone, what would be the equivalent amount of your local heroin to say, 8mg dilaudid?

This way I hope to get an idea of how strong Aus street gear is compared to US stuff - it would be nice to know if the exorbitant prices we pay is justified :\",1508636289.0

Schizoid and I both gave out a bunch of doses of narcan, sent to us by the lovely Fash, to people who could use them; we had three left between us. Our mutual, and my best, friend came over, and did a shot in the bathroom. We knew he was doing a shot, and he was doing it out of my sight out of respect for me getting off dope and into a MMT program for nearly the last month; what we didn't know was that he shot up like a whole gram of good tar. Once he came out of the bathroom, he fell out while sitting cross legged on our living room floor as I smoked weed with schizoid and her husband and we all watched Black Mirror. Schizoid and I both knew right away *exactly* what fuckin' happened, and we both sprinted for the narcan.

Just so it's clear, our buddy is like 6'7"" and like 265 lbs, so he's a big dude. I mean, I'm not small at 6 foot even and hovering around 200, but moving that much dead weight was gonna SUCK, if I even could. Luckily, when he fell out, he fell on his back.

So, we hit him with two nasal sprays of narcan, and nothing. He's still seizing and getting more and more blue, while breathing less and less. Schizoid says, ""You know how to do a sternum rub, right?"" So I start doing sternum rubs, but within a minute or two, he stops breathing. I begin to do chest compressions and get him to take a few small breaths; just enough for me to give him the third, and last, shot of narcan, which he managed to inhale.

I continue to do chest compressions to keep him breathing manually: he still had a pulse, but wasn't breathing. Slowly, he took a few shallow breaths: though they were spread FAR too far apart, they were picking up. Once he got to larger, stuttering inhalations, his eyes flickered. So I started kinda slapping his face and telling him to wake up, which he slowly did. Even after he was able to respond verbally, his eyes kept wanting to roll back and pull him back out of consciousness, but I wouldn't let him fall back out.

But, finally, he sat up. Luckily, I didn't get punched, but he did panic as soon as he could realize that the EMTs were not only on the way, but arriving. EMTs take vitals, then say he's looking good, that his friends did exactly what they would have done anyways, and if he feels okay, he could stay here.

So we kept him an eye on him, and am still doing so now. He seems okay, though he IS withdrawing now. 

So, thanks to /u/FashionablyFake's narcan, he's alive. I'm still shaking, but it's over now.

And *that's* what I did today.",1508636103.0

That is an article from the JMU Breeze student newspaper about this situation.

So this kid goes to college near me and I read some newspaper articles about what happened.  So this guy had an apartment and had his gf over and she overdosed, her friend rushes her to the hospital where police are waiting, the kid doesnt tell hospital staff exactly what she took but said she was an opiate abuser, and the girl eventually overdoses and dies.

For months this girls parents have gone on a crusade to try and ruin this guys life and finally they got the police to charge him with 2nd degree murder and held him on NO BAIL.  They claim by him not being completely up fron with what she took to the hospital staff that it caused them to not know how to treat the girl.  That is such bullshit since ANY EMT OR PARAMEDIC KNOWS WHAT AN OPIATE OD LOOKS LIKE.  The girl was prescribed Xanax as well, which the hospital knew.

So now the JMU newspaper wrote a TERRIBLE article about the situation and its filled with biased bullshit.  I feel so bad for this kid because he is the one being punished for his gf making shitty decisions.  Her parents refuse to admit she could do anything wrong and claim he was a bad influence that got her hooked on drugs.   nevermind the fact that the paramedics obviously knew this girl was falling out on opiates and would have Narcanned her either way. SPREAD THIS STORY BECAUSE THIS KID MIGHT GOTO JAIL FOR LIFE BECAUSE OF THIS!!

/u/Traceyh415 it would be awesome if you read this and maybe mentioned it somewhere that your notoriety could help.  you are a great mouthpiece for the harm reduction movement and could really help this kid out.

I kept running with it, on and off. The last, I got some oxys. Then high on those, I got nostalgic for tar and picked up a gram. Then high the next day, read a good review, picked up some ECP too. What the fuck is wrong with you, AATL??

The tar was lovely, always enjoyed it. The ECP, I now believe was very fenty, there's no fucking way it should have lasted this long. Think I still had close to half gram, two weeks later. 

And I stopped, I'm done, fuck this shit. Went through w/d's, my SO asking all weekend what's wrong with me, and me playing it off. I get better, yay, I'm done! 

And even better? I've still got (at that time) easily .75 or more of the ECP left! I can get some time behind me, but later on... yanno, I'll be able to handle my shit now, I stopped *while I had some*, so I could totally do some later on, like on the weekend, and then stop. No big deal!

Not even two full fucking days, y'all. But I know none of y'all surprised. I talked with a friend about it, and finally decided I had to come clean. So. Fucking. Scared. But I wasn't going to go through withdrawals again in front of my SO. 

So I finally had the conversation. Just like the intervention shows, I wrote my thoughts down ahead of time, so as not to get digressive. There were tears. I'm fucking shocked there were tears way earlier than I expected, as soon as I started reading. But the optimists on the last thread were right. For one, she already knew *something* was up - though she'd not suspected heroin. But she accepted me. She accepted my apology. She assured me she's here for me, she truly does love me, what can she do to help? *cries a little more* 

I admitted to heroin rather than pills, and she watched me flush probably close to a half gram. Yes, my mind is already freaking the fuck out over that. She asked me when was the last time, and I said about 10 mins before I talked to her, I did a little bump because of the stress. 

But she's here. She's gonna see me through it. She's going to support my efforts and my inevitable success. I keep breaking down every so often, to realize I told her and she **didn't** leave. 

Thank you guys for being an amazing community. Y'all keep people sane and safe long enough to even make this decision, and it fucking matters. Tracey, I'm inspired by your work, and your continued involvement in the scene, to accomplish just that. 

Dunno how much longer I'll be around here, y'all, but it's been a hell of a ride. Oh yeah, any suggestions on getting through withdrawals easier, now that I don't have to hide it, would be great. Can't get any prescription meds (unless y'all wanna send em to me lol), but any other advice would be welcome. It's far from my first time doing w/d's, but it's the first time I've got someone to support me and help me through it.

This lead to thinking back to Trauma ICU days, and caring for folks after the worst. The things I had seen and the what ifs...

Then the worst (best?) thought of all. 

Dying by overdose is not the worst way I can think of to leave this realm of existence. 

Better than dying mangled after a vehicle crash. Brain dead after a horse riding accident. Falling and hitting the head and being a vegetable after the craniotomy. (Dear lord such a worse fate than death). Watching as people are in distress with various organ failure and aware that the moments are numbered, struggling just to breath. Withdrawing all the life support and waiting to see if they last long enough to wheel down to hospice or not. So much less paperwork if the survive the hour and the short bed move. 

I then think of what it must feel like to OD. I've never even been close to such a thing. Just a pain management patient taking meds as directed. I just picture it as going to sleep. 

Then I read the stories here about the near miss, the narcan administered, the rattle I know all too well, and it is just as easy to have the OD be as traumatic as the car crash.

Wednesday night I went to McDonalds while I was stuck waiting on my ride, I ordered almost $20 in food which I never got to fucking eat, still salty no lie. On my walk there someone stopped me with testers, well sure don't mind if I do. 

That free tester killed me, the paramedics told me they were amazed I even came back that they were called late. THANKS ASSHOLE BIG BROTHER! I was rushed to the hospital with a heart rate of 190, apparently which was enough to kill me all over again on its own. 

First time ODing and getting Narcaned in the overdose capital of America. 

My one dealer went the fuck off on me for taking random drugs from random people, didn't have the heart to remind him that's how we met but whatevers. 

I've only used once since, and it was definitely a wake up call. 

Was kind of annoyed they brought me back initially, like that is legit the most peaceful way to go its scary. 

Forgot to add, when the asshole ran my pockets I had almost $50 on me and a bus pass. Fucker took it all, I had to walk home from the fucking hospital. A good hour walk. ",1508607440.0

So I've been on 95 mg Methadone daily for about a year. I used to do heroin or these morphine extended release pills that you have to crush, they're called Skenan in France. 

I've been pretty good at keeping up with my methadone schedule, don't take more than prescribed and I haven't touched Heroin ever since. However, I make sure to have some Skenan in case I get a bad headache.

I have terrible migraines originating from the skull so no neurologic medicament works, which led to me seeking heroin in the first place. I take 100 to 200 mg up the butt and it usually works wonders, however I only do it twice per month at the very most. 

So long story short, I've been suicidal for a few years and I had a pretty bad fallout with someone close this night, which, on top of other pretty bad problems I have, led to me saying fuck it. Therefore you should NEVER DO what follows, if you intend to stay alive like any normal human being.

Here it goes: This morning (it's 1PM here) I took all the methadone I had left, only a bit more than 180 mg since I have to go to the clinic tomorrow but I'm used to split dosing, which means taking 50/45 at a time. Then I took some Valium, I have a pretty much infinite tolerance but it was more than 100 mg. To top it off, before the methadone was metabolized, I took 500mg morphine (400 in the ass and ate 100).

I thought I'd either feel better or probably die, but weirdly I didn't come close to the latter. I felt a rush, was and am nodding, but I am completely functional and even went to a course later in the morning.

I'm back from it. It's been about 3 hours since I've taken the pills, and I'm starting to feel reaally drowsy, I'm having trouble even writing this thread. I also stopped crying and thinking about me being a fuck up. 

So basically I have trouble staying awake and I feel quite good. I barely remember what it's like to be high anymore, and I've never done morphine (only quite strong heroin). I don't know if I'm high and should just stay awake and enjoy or it's just the Valium putting me to sleep.

The actual question is: can I still get high from opiates while on 95mg methadone, if I took the morphine before my daily dose was metabolized?

All use is logged. About a year into use began working out heavily, 6x weekly making great gains. Have stuck to it religiously and improved my diet hugely. 

My doctors always find it odd when I tell them about my lifestyle (i'm very open about use). I suppose the image of a junkie is sedated, lazy, and physically breaking down, but my situation couldn't be farther from that. When I was 100% sober I had no motivation to do shit. I was overweight, lazy, socially anxious, and all-around just in a bad way. Now, I arguably I look like a junkie that went sober and turned his life around, I just did it while using.

I'm a bit of an odd bird when it comes to hyd/oxy use to begin with, as I take them purely for energy and motivational reasons to work harder and longer. I've enjoyed a lot of financial success from it. When I tell doctors this, they find it highly unusual because most people are using for sedation or simply a good time. I know i'm not alone in this, as I've read plenty of people take opiates for energy. However, it seems to me I dont read a lot about people taking their fitness and physique seriously while using, so i'm asking if any of you are.

This friend is pretty straight edge, smokes the occasional joint. He knows I've fucked around in the drug game for awhile and seems fascinated by it. I always reinforce my belief that he has incredible potential and I don't think he should touch any hard drugs or really be affiliated with the drug world whatsoever, and he takes my advice to heart. 

So the homeless homie told me he lost him umbrella, and I'm like, ""dude fuck it I'll go to wal mart right now and get you a brand new one, I'll be right back,"" and my straight edge friend came with me to wal mart while homeless dude stayed posted up flying his cardboard sign. My friend tells me he's always thought I should write a book, because he's heard some of my drug game stories retold from my best friend who he sees often. He said he has so many questions and that a book would answer them. I told him I trust him and know he doesn't judge, ask away and I'll answer honestly. 

We were talking about an area in the county next to ours just before this conversation (for those of you in WA, we were talking about how fucked the KP is) and he asked me what my worst memory is from out on the KP. There's a few, but I told him the story of what I thought was the worst one. 

There was this trap house that my junkie associates and I used to frequent, it was the most popular on the KP before it finally got shut down and closed off with police tape for good. I'm talking bi-weekly raids, constant bloody fights, constant flow of people in and out, kitchen always full of people shooting up, guns and piles of cash out in the open type shit. Ya know, normal trap house stuff. So one guy I had a few good talks with overdoses, and no one finds him until he's good and dead. I tried chest compressions, but he had no heartbeat and we have no clue how long he had been dead. So we take his body outside at like 1 in the morning, and there's about 10 of us yelling over each other about what to do. Yes call 911, fuck no don't call 911, try more chest compressions, try more narcan, etc. It was tense. So in the middle of everyone arguing, the wife of the owner of the house silently drags his body to her car and stuffs him in, then drives away. We're silent. She comes back about 5 minutes later and says she dropped the body in front of the fire station, quit talking about it, it's over. 

So I told him this story and it just got me thinking about the value we hold to life itself in the drug world. No other scene besides in like fuckin Africa are kids walking around with guns and killing each other over 5 dollars. That shit happens all the time. I've lost one friend to murder in this game, and it's just so frustrating that it was over some dope or some dope money. Like where do we draw the line?",1508739100.0

I was waiting on my dude for a couple hours and then his phone was off.   So I figured fuck he’s not gonna come through and I was already going through some pretty heavy withdrawals.  I had 1 8mg suboxone strip for a rainy day like this.   I broke a piece off approximately 1-2mg.  Put it under my tongue, after about an hour my dude shows up at my door with my bags.  I didn’t really get much relief from the suboxone still had watery eyes,yawning, and chills.  So I decide to do a little 20 bag maybe .15 of some good ecp/fent mix.  Got a crazy rush and a nice little nod going on.   I didn’t expect to feel anything honestly.  But I’m actually happy with the results.   I feel higher than I would if I would have just done the bag alone.   So is it really true that some small amounts of suboxone can actually potentiate the heroin?  I have been reading a little bit about it and some people call the mix of sub and dope a “dupe”

Happy nodding my friends.

“No.”

“Yes.  I’m supposed to be getting on methadone Tuesday morning.”

At one point during my heavy IV drug use, just one day when I would shoot in my right arm, it would feel incredibly uncomfortable putting the needle in my vein. I could just... I don't know, it's as if I became hyper sensitive to metal breaking through every tiny layer of skin and vein until I was in, so I usually try to use my left. Well if you have experience with IV coke, you know it messes your veins the fuck up hardcore, so I had to use a tie off for my most recent shot. I never have to do that after about 3 years of sporadic but for the most part consistent IV use. 

I tied off and had to use my right arm because my I've been using my left too much. Once again it was incredibly uncomfortable getting the needle in there,  I cringed and the hairs stood up on my neck. I register, fine and dandy, and then blast off. But when I blasted off, it felt as if I could feel the liquid entering and coursing through the entry point of my vein. You know how a gust of wind ripples an inflatable tube man at car lots? It was like that, then my whole forearm felt weird. This was probably 15 minutes ago, my forearm still has a strange feeling in it, like an urgent need to stretch like with RLs during opiate WDs, and my hand kinda has it too but a slight twinge of pain to it. There's also some tingly numbness in my forearm and hand, but not a lot. These symptoms are becoming progressively prevelant.

Hope everyone's fine and not WDing through lack of funds or worse no one has anything !! So I've not posted for a good few months as I've been in town staying at a friend selling heroin. Did it for about 8/10 months and boy what a fucking headache! I forgot how stressful this shit could be plus getting busted 3 times but the fuckers got nothing as any large amounts would be banked at all times and a few tenner bags and halls are easy enough to swallow. 
    Junkies just don't give a fuck!  At the door at 5 am wanting a poxy tenner bag. Personally, I'd never dream of going to someone's door at that time! But that's just me. I'd arrange to go to someone's door at 12:30/1am if I had money going into the bank that night but I would go and tell my dealer I was doing as such and order what I wanted just I case he/she sold out.

   One night we got into a heated argument with a couple of idiots and they came back(I think) and set the door on fire with an aerosol can! Lol, The smoke alarms went off and I went to the front door where flames were licking from underneath the door and setting the carpet on fire and just at that moment the can exploded! As I was right next to it on the other side of the door I fucking shit a brick! And had no idea what was on the other side! So I ended up jumping out the kitchen window and luckily I was on the ground floor and the only person in at the time as the people that caused the altercation had left to go to their own flat which was only a few levels up from me. I phoned for the fire brigade and shouted up to my friends that the close(stairwell) was on fire and to get out as it was quickly filling up with thick black smoke. Just at this point a punter comes up and asks if I've got obviously seeing the fire and black smoke blowing out the back close door I tell him no (which I didn't) and asked if he couldn't see the fucking fire and this wasn't the best time! He asks if my mate is holding up the stairs and I tell him I think he does but now isn't the best time! The crazy bastard then proceeds to go into the close by the fire and up the stairs! Lol He gets there and asks him to sell him a half gram in which ***** asks him if he cant see what is going on and the police and fire brigade are just about to show up but he still insists that he sell him the half while chocking on the thick black smoke ! ***** hunts him and puts wet towels at the front door to block the smoke as his GF doesn't have the best mobility and she's freaking out. Just as the half-wit comes back down the stairs face as black as a coal miner the fire brigade turn up and police and quickly put the fire out. Luckily I didn't panic to much and got rid of everything incriminating in the living room and took the barricade off the front door or they would have had a difficult time getting in but I did just shove the scoring money under the couch but it was still there when the firemen gave the all clear so that was cool the police seemed to think it was some sort of drugs war as in a separate incident a few weeks before it some arsehole set fire to a Pram in the close it was no real danger just a load of smoke. The door, on the other hand, could have been a lot worse! Apparently, there must be a firebug in the area as there have been a number of fires in the area so I'm not sure if it was the people my friends hand a fight with half an hour before the fire. 

  I also started getting a bit heavily into crack though it's not really my drug of choice (I'd rather have a bit of speed) it was good stuff as the guy selling it was going all the way down to England to get it. But the first pipe is always the best and the other ones you are just chasing that first one and your spending £100/£200 on something your not going to get again that night. I was doing alright on the dealing selling about a half ounce easily a day and double or triple that on a good day and was putting out 0.23g for a tenner and 0.47g for £20 so made about £280/290 every half oz. 

  Ended up jacking it in as people where falling out with each other because of the crack it was honestly changing people personalities and I couldn't be fucked with all the bullshit anymore so decided to go back to my mums been here for about a month and I'm down to about a half gram or tenner bag a day and hopefully get on the foil soon as I'm injecting in my groin and it's a bit risky and don't want to risk losing my leg just because I'm lazy and can't be bothered with the rigmarole of finding a vein in my arms as nearly 20 years of this shit has taken its toll I don't have any collapsed veins but some are cerossed and you can't really register in them. So hopefully in a week or two ill be off the shit and have a cupboard full of dihydrocodeine to detox with as well.

So until today I had no idea what precipitated withdrawal was. 
So for the past week I've been pretty much binging on roxys yesterday at about 2:00 afternoon I crushed up 5 30s and snorted my last line of roxys. Well today I woke up and decided that I was going to get back on subs for a while. So at exactly 11:00 this morning I took 3 8mg subs. A little bit of time goes by and I'm waiting for that decent rush that comes over you. I got up to go to the bathroom and started feeling dizzy, then after a few minutes it really hit me hard. My nose was running, I was shivering, I was sweating out of every pour and had a haze in my head. It reminded me of a time when I was younger and smoked k2 and had a horrible reaction and freaked out. Anyways, for about 2 hours I was in complete agony. It was like I was seeing what it was like to live in hell. By far the worst feeling I have ever felt. I finally passed out and then a few hours later I woke up feeling way better but I still feel a little iffy. After doing so.e research I realized what precipitated withdrawals are. I'm here to tell you that shot is real and it will fuck you up.

I'm curious if anyone here actually maintains this kind of relationship with opiates. I really don't need the ""stay away while you still can"" spiel.

I recently stumbled upon some old 10mg oxy/hydro bottles (like 100 pills leftover from years ago kind of thing). Long story short, I was bored and curious and ended up using small amounts throughout the week (no more than 25 mg in a single day). They are no longer in my possession. 

Using 40mg Prozac for half a year has helped a great deal with intrusive thoughts and feelings of hopelessness -- but I've been more lethargic and lacking motivation. Anyway, I was surprised that the opiates had the opposite effect of what I had expected. I always associated them with ""nodding off"" in a drooling daze, but I found that the low doses were incredibly stimulating. Kinda like the come up of an amphetamine, without that terrible speedy crash. I become more social, energetic, and interested in accomplishing things.

I'm guessing this is how it starts? Like it's absolutely not viable to use them in this manner for an extended period of time? I've always been attracted to stimulants, since I'm a generally low energy person -- but the crashes kill it for me. I know exercise, sleep, and water are king, yada yada.",1508699956.0

I ran out of gabapentin yesterday-- however i swear yest night after taking 6mg of immodium (and 6mg earlier that day, 12-24hr half life). I had absolutely no chills for the first time.

This morning i took 8mg lope and some dextroamphetamine (For mood, and to retain shitting abilities)-- however am still getting some cold chills and goosebumps... presumably since i no longer have the gabapentin.

should i take another 4mg lope now, or save that for tomm?

would taking 12mg loperamide a day for 2 days delay withdrawals, or merely mask symptoms while i recover?

i have no cash left whatsoever, so if i did go with 12mg lope today-- assuming that removes my chills, ill have nothing for tomm (day 4); which im hoping is the day i wont need anything to cope.


any help is appreciated, as i have a hit of heroin in front of me that is rather tempting xD",1508856789.0

I'm looking for a current user to try and give a voice to a sometimes misunderstood and misrepresented community. I figured this forum may help get the word out.

We've talked to different local organisations, charities, hospitals, etc but what we're missing is the most important voice and that's of the people directly connected to it. It's a sensitive issue, but such an important one. Heroin can really affect peoples lives, and our purpose is to tell these people's stories to help open up the conversation on it.

Ok it sounds trite but *seriously*, fellow IV users, just *try* it and get back to me. Tonight I discovered that if I, right after pushing the plunger all the way and leaning back to feel that wonderful sensation, then proceed to consciously take deep breaths, it *really* intensifies the feeling of the rush. It's as if I can feel the oxygen ""hitting"" me like its own separate drug. And it's not a subtle feeling at all, it's quite a difference to where I can feel when the oxygen is dropping and it's time for another inhale.

And I'm imagining that training myself to consciously breathe deeply right after hitting brings its own benefits. Like, I remember reading once that a lot of the tissue/organ damage actually comes from suppressed breathing.

This has also got me thinking that increased oxygen in general would make the rush more intense. Like maybe if I did light cardio before hitting...

What do y'all do to intensify the rush, fellow IV users? Or simply to enjoy it as much as possible?",1508826204.0

I've always thought my habit was pretty bad but there's many a group of people who have it way worse, and I cannot comment if it will work for daily H IV users who experience strong symptoms such as shitting yourself etc (I've never experienced that).

But I'm a 160-200mg of instant release oxynorm user 3-4 days a week and have had small stints with insufflating 70-80% pure hammer aswell as a few weeks of up to a ml a dose from the fentantyl spray bottles available on the darknet.

Once my runny nose, aches and pains and depleted motivation / desire to do anything but lie in bed kicks in, I pop a few of these lyrica pills and within 90 minutes it all gets pushed away to the side for a bit. You can certainly still feel the withdrawals, but the slight lyrica buzz and small pain relief really contributes to getting through the day quicker.

It for some reason dries my nose and eyes and gives me motivation to get shit done with little of the 'sharp edges' of the withdrawal.

Go to a doctor and say you are a programmer or something and experiencing carpal tunnel or something. This is how I got them, however they are very expensive to buy, but very very handy !

Would be keen to hear if anyone else has tried it and find that it works ?

PS I take 3-4 75mg tablets, i try not to get 'high' from them as its not really a high just a wobbly, valium like state which I don't like. But 3-4 gives me a slight buzz and fucks the wolf off my shoulder !

So I'm sitting there about 5!'ins and this beautiful lady stops by my car asking if I'm waiting for aj. I tell her yes and after some calls he doesn't answer. 

Now I never let people in my car because I'm afraid of being robbed. First she asked for a ride and j declined. Then she asked if I knew Steve. Unfortunately I don't know anybody else she said that this dude Steve has good shit. I took the chance and I let her in my car. She calls Steve and he's good. 

We start driving... girl has to stop for crack. I'm not into crack but I'm extremely into dope so if dropping to get crack is what I needed to do then we are stopping for crack 😂. We pick up Steve... he has to go get it. Already more steps than I anticipated but I keep in mind that I would be going home empty handed without going through this. 

So we arrive at the spot and ""five minutes"" ""about to pull up"". I'm chill but the girl, high on crack, is very anxious. It's almost 12 by this point. After an hour dude pulls up and we get the shy. Everything went perfectly. I got a new plug after 4 years. I even tried to give the girl a 5 in exchange for her help but she didn't want it. She even tried to give me gas money. I would have normally never done this. I'm so happy to get home with some amazing product and annew plug. Shit I was almost buzzing from it working out well. 

Be safe everyone. Was too excited to not share my story with anyone. Cloud 9 haha. I also found out that my dude was raided and the spot is hot and it's not a good idea for me to pull up there. If anyone is seen there it's an immediate trespassingn charge. I'd noticed that There wasn't really anyone else there lately. So I'm happy to know that as well.

Now in my mid twenties but iv been struggeling with opioid addiction for about 5 years now. So yesterday i was at a friends place and he got a few oxys from a guy, 40mg oc's, so i took 40mg because iv been chipping pretty succesfully since midsummer. Its was pretty underwhelming and really not worth it, should at least have dosed double. But today i had a lot of beers and got drunk, ended up at the same guy and shot maybe a total of 20-30mg together with some speed paste (maybe 0.5-0,7gs divided on 2 or 3 injections, the speed contained some meth which is unusual here, mostly straight amphetamine)

Anyhow, my first question is: do you guys think its a chance in hell that i will pass my standard urine test which is on thursday in about 8 hours from now? Its possible for me to drink massive amounts of water, dilute and eat b vitamins to make my piss yellow. 

If not what should i tell my therapist? Honestly i feel im just weak, iv been trying at least relapse so i can piss clean but this is relly starting to get out of hand. I tell my self next week i wont iv anything but then i end up at least iv'ing speed, then usually morphine 1-2 times a month. 

I felt like i had control until today. I dont think ill use tomorrow although id probably piss dirty, i just dont need the wds on top of this.. Iv hidden my casual speed/coke/opi chipping my my drug therapist but im seriously considering fessing up although it might make me loose my economic support from the state which is my bread and butter..

What is amazing this time around is I experienced almost no withdrawal. I slept every night ate at least 2 meals a day and didn't have diarrhea until day 7 but it passed. I have no drug dreams and no desire to use, which is extremely odd. Sometimes I'm just done and quit on the spot. I smoked for 2 years and one day quit cold turkey. Another time I was addicted to benzos for 2 years and in the last 6 months my dosage was up to 25-40mg clonazolam a day. I tried going to the hospital for detox but they said they never heard of clonazolam so they sent me home and I went cold turkey and experienced withdrawal for 30 days. Day 31 is when I started to feel better.

I always knew I'd be prepared for when opiate withdrawal hit if I was able to get through 30 days of CT benzo withdrawal but the thing is I didn't want to until now. Shit is old and played out and I really want to quit this time for me. I think if I can quit benzos and tobacco CT I can do the same with dope. It's weird there was a flip switched in my brain to where I don't want it anymore.

What really sucks is I feel that's the point everyone needs to get to to quit. Outside pressure will only keep a person sober temporarily. What really sucks is some people die or lose everything before they realize they don't want that life.

This is most definitely a shitpost sorry guys just writing how I feel.",1508810044.0

As an amateur linguist, I was curious.  For a country with a severe addiction crisis in the 1840s (think opium), you would think they certainly have a native word for it, and they do.  The etymology and character construction are quite telling, the word for addiction, 瘾 yin (third tone), is derived from the disease radical 疒 (a sideways pictogram of a sickbed back 3000 years ago) and the word 隐, also pronounced yin (third tone), that means hidden or withdrawn for society.  I guess that implies that the Chinese believed that addiction is a disease, and that its primary symptom is withdrawal from social interactions.

Humans are the ultimate social animals, and the opioid system (present since at least to time of jawed fish for pain modulation) has been coopted to reward social behavior.  Every time someone holds your hand, you receive a hug, a kiss, or have sex, your brain gets a hit of endorphins to reward you for the behavior.  But as opiate addicts, our brains have found something else to take the place of social interaction.  Whether we had good social connections or a loving family to start with, we found something that can produce the same reward (and then some) while withdrawing from those around us, a cocoon of warmth even if we’re profoundly lonely, and I find that heartbreakingly sad.

DopeBoy 1 has been my go to guy for almost 3 years. 99 times out of 100, I go thru him. This weekend he took a ""vacation"", and didn't leave the phone with anyone else. Was forced to get shit from DopeBoy 2, who's stuff was actually alright! Anyways, DB1 calls me this morning and says he's back, and he ""has new fire he knows I'll love""! I've got $60 to my name today, and I've gotta stretch it. I go to DB1 and right off the rip I notice it STINKS like vinegar bad! I mean you can smell it thru the paper! ""Call me and tell me how ya like it"" he says. I bust ass home and throw .1 in my spoon. Fix it all up and push off only to have my lips and throat go numb, and a loud ringing in my ears for maybe 30 seconds then it goes away. That's it. Still feel like shit with running nose, watery eyes, gotta poop, etc. I call him back and ask, ""You still at your house?"". He says yep, and I tell him I'll be right back over. 

I pull up out front of his house 15 mins later and call him. When he answers I tell him to come to the door, that I'm here, and to bring some money. He says why bring money, and I tell him cuz I need a refund on this bunk ass shit! He hangs up on me and starts hitting the bitch button on me when I call. Ok, fine, fuck it. He lives in a kinda condo type deal with tons of neighbors and shit, and usually just walking up to his door is a no no. That $60 was all I had, fuck this. I walk directly to his door and start knocking. I hear kids inside yelling, ""DADDY! Someone at the door!"". Two more knocks and he opens up with a ""WTF ARE YOU DOING look on his face! I hand him the bag and he starts with the, ""Man, you did more than half of this!"". I told him to throw it on the clock, that I did only .1. He reaches in his pocket and pulls out $30, talking about that's all he's gonna give back for it. At that point, I'm ready to take what I can get an go! I grab it and tell him something's better than being stuck with his GARBAGE! Fuuuuuuuuckkk....

Anyway, I mention DB2 only because I call him after I leave 1's place. When I get over to 2's place and he comes out laughing. I ask what's so funny and he goes on to tell me that I won't have to come back for a refund with his shit! Somehow he already knew what had happened! This is a smallish city, but damn I didn't know it was that close! 

tl;dr Spend $60 on some garbage shit from one guy. Went back to get a refund, and only got a partial. When I went to another dboy, he already heard about me getting a refund from the other guy. Had only been MAYBE 30 mins...

UPDATE: DBoy 1 calls me at 3:30 this afternoon and says ""You busy? If not, leave in like 20 mins and head over, I've got something for you."". I left at 4 and got to his place about 4:25. Soon as I pull up he comes walking out to my car. He jumps in and pulls out his scale and proceeds to dump .2 on a piece of paper for me. ""Yesterday was bad, bro. We've never had a falling out like that, and I feel bad about it. I'm sorry for what happened, I hope this kinda makes up for it."". The shit is different, and looks pretty good! I get home and throw half of it (.1) in my spoon and make a shot. It's not ""knock me on my ass fire"", but it's deff WAY better than what he had! I called him up and told him we are square!

I got my reddit to vent and it helps to know people can relate. 

Today: 

My day off. Usually if I plan right, I can do enough bags to nod off into oblivion.  
But money has been tight. I've been spoiled with a plentiful amount that's now halted to nothing. 
The run is coming to an end..I can truly feel it..

In my bed, chain smoking and watching YouTube on my phone. 
I stopped paying my wifi months ago. Our tv doesn't work. 
My boyfriend is in the bathroom smoking crack.  Our last $20 went to a vile of hard for him and a bag for me. I wasn't even excited when we went to score. I can't seem to be in the moment when I know what's ahead. 

Our highs are like two ships that sail pass. 
We don't really hang out that much and when we do we are both on totally different levels. 

If I stay awake I think too much and can't escape the prison of my problems and my misery..even when ""high"". 
So all I really do is sleep. 

But today, I'm low. I have one bag to last me the next 12 hours and I'm scared to be awake. 
I wont be able to sleep. Even with one bag ..still my brain is in overdrive.
This is what I hate the most--what my mind has become. 
It's this evil parasite that feeds my anxiety with scary thoughts of the consequences of my addiction. And the severity of my situation. 
I hate the extreme of being low/out and having too much and being obnoxiously high only to waste it with sleep. 
I used to be so good a tapering..at conserving..but these binges. 
God dammit the binging. 
Why do I have to be so excessive? 
 
I don't look in the mirror anymore. I don't do my makeup. I hate the way I look now. I haven't dyed my hair in months. My roots are so grown out that it screams relapse. 
I haven't showered in so long. 
I can't even remember last time I thought about sex. 
Earlier my boyfriend was holding me while I was crying. We don't even touch each other most. 
I just really needed him to hold and comfort me today. 
I can't seem to find a way out and I plead with him to help me, help us. 
He's just as lost. We share this dirty secret habit together. 
His misery is my company. 

I'm holding his body and he's holding me..we've become skeletons. 
It's so eye opening that it makes me sick to my stomach. 
I look to my SO..my only friend. My only love. The only person I feel can see me like this. 
He doesn't deserve me like this. I don't deserve this. Yet I can't seem to talk my sick mind out of this cycle.

I know he's suffering, he's just good at covering up. 
But I've been suffering so long that i can hide it anymore.

It's so fucking obvious. 
Just 7 months ago I was still in school, active online with Social media. Keeping up with friends. I had my car so the freedom to drive away was always an comforting option for me. Still keeping up with my looks, always posting/taking selfies. Me and my bf went on dates, we went out. Listened to music and cuddled watching tv. I was successfully weaning down on suboxone..I was at .05mg a day. 
But all of that has changed.
None of that is the same. It's all gone. 

7months ago...
I had just started snorting h. 
I'd pretty much gone my entire ""opiate"" career avoiding this demon.
I had been on subs for 3 years prior and I was just then starting to get antsy about getting high again. 

I snorted it one night and havnt stopped since. 
 Heroin has ruined my life faster then what's even believable. I don't even feel like it's my life that it's ruining, it's that sudden. 

My birthday is next week and I'm dreading it. I don't want to go another year like this. I don't want to celebrate my birthday isolated and wrecked. 

Today I cry for the old me. I cry for who I've become. I cry for my bf. I cry about being 27 next week. I just fucking cry..it's so sad. 
I need to save myself before it's too late. 

Thanks for letting me share and anyone who reads this. Sorry this is depressing AF. I'm just keeping it real and I need help, advice, kind words. 
Anything other then keeping it bottled up.

~~


I was at The Drug Policy Alliance Reform Conference in Atlanta last weekend, and there was one panel centered on self-care. It's true - as drug users, too often we neglect our bodily and emotional needs.

~~


One of the problems is the way I use. It's not uncommon for me to cook up three small shots and shoot three times in a row, usually all in different places. I can hit in some places in my hand, a lot of my wrist area, a lot of my forearm, and the inside of my elbow (but I'm trying to avoid that area). I know this is atypical, right? People just cook one shot shoot once. I like to maintain a level of functional high as I'm a young college student doing a hard degree, and so maybe shoot up 5-8 times a day of small shorts? Can anyone add any suggestions to what I'm doing, I'm open to any changes in routine.

~~

I find that working out, at least my arms, helps keep my veins usable and healthy looking. With the added benefit of having ""hot arms"" (so long as you don't develop an abscess or something...)

Can anyone recommend a cream that I could put on my hands and arm? I'm trying to heal, prevent scarring, and keep the area clean to prevent infections.

I use a new needle/cooker/cotton/sterile water each time but sometimes I still get these crazy skin reactions: It looks like hives. Does anyone know what's specifically causing it? How do it prevent it?

I have an appointment to meet with a doctor about getting on Suboxone tomorrow! I've tried quitting before but I never made it past a month. Any advice about those? Methadone makes me sick, ive only ever crushed subs and injected them (lmfao, I had a micron filter, still I know it's bad for me)

 You learn a lot from being an opioid user. And I love the harm reduction/drug policy reform community. But honestly, I'm scared, because for the first time I'm going to have an addiction treated by a medical professional. Any words of comfort would be immensely appreciated.

(kinda long, kinda rambling)","I had never heard of Junkie Jesus until I began posting here a couple weeks ago. Despite all of the stories and sightings I've read about here, I thought he was just a myth. And then, a couple hours ago...

So I've been without anything except my gabapentin script for about a week and a half, nearly two weeks. Probably three weeks, really, since my plug ripped me off and gave me something that was probably 5% dope, and 95% some other powder. And at that time, I thought my time on the H train had come to an end, as he was my last connect. Or so I thought.

This morning I was feeling very antsy (especially after seeing all the porn you guys post here), so I set out to find a new connect. I had no money, so I don't know why I thought that this would be a successful trip. But I was determined! I knew of a house not too far from me where one of my other connects (one who is currently in detox awaiting the Vivitrol shot) would go to score some fiiire dope. I drove her there a couple times, but she would never introduce me to her dude. Apparently the guy is very paranoid about new people, which I totally get. But again, I was determined...so I said fuck it and drove over there. I mean, the guy knew my car...certainly he had seen my face each time. No way was I going to get stabbed or the shit beaten out of me...showing up asking for his number for a future hookup because I don't have any money.

So as I'm just about to pull up to the house, I see my last connect...the one who ripped me off...riding his bike. The one who wouldn't answer my calls or texts. I should state that he uses as well, which is one reason why I was so convinced that I got took. So I stop and he immediately pedals over to me, and tells me that his phone has been shut off, and asked me about the last time and whether I enjoyed what he got for me. I told him that it did nothing but burn my nostril, to which he told me that I'm not the only one...he got some of it for himself later that night and discovered it was garbage. Said he tried to get in touch with me, but his phone was off, and he doesn't save numbers, so he couldn't call me using someone else's phone. He then asked me if I needed anything, which...of course I did!...but I was broke. He goes, ""Aww man, that sucks."" And just as I was about to tell him I'd hit him up in a couple days when I have money again, he says, ""Pull over here for a minute. Let me see if I can get something off my dude here.""

Long story short (too late)...he came back out with a dime of that aforementioned fire dope and handed it off to me. ""Hope this makes up for that shit last week."" Which...of course it does! And then he got in the car and cut up a line from his own supply, and split it with me. 

So, friends...it has been a good day. He even said he'd introduce me to paranoid dude soon, too. Thank fucking christ! 

And because I'm now in such a great mood, I am going to start typing up one of my favorite stories to share with you later (or sometime soon). It's a long story, and since I'm a wannabe writer, I tend to add a lot of unnecessary details for storytelling purposes.

I'm still clean from H, on the MMT program though and I did meth last week. This isn't the ideal ""Abstinence"" Program, but it's a lot better than the half gram of fire BTH and meth I was doing every day.

Honestly what worked for me was cutting all ties with and deleting the numbers of my using friends and changing my phone number.

IDK if any of you remember the story last year about the ex girlfriend who used to be my dgirl that I helped relapse last year at a romantic hotel staycation. She ended up going back to prison in February but got out in August. While gone she wrote me some boohoo letter begging for my forgiveness. I wrote back saying everything she said was a fucking lie and that the only way she would get my forgiveness was if she got out did well for a while and let everything else fall together and that I wasn't ready to talk to her. She didn't like that, she blew up my phone for a day then never called me back. She got out in August and hooked up with the dude I was bunkies with in prison. Dude is alright, better than the psycho ex of hers who beat her and whom she cheated on me with after she got out the first time, before the hotel. But the new BF is a tweaker. So I knew what was up when she was posting pictures with him with in two weeks of getting out, at 3 or 4am. Getting cracked back. Fuck her..

When she got out she blocked me on Facebook after I simply messaged hey... whatever... but about three weeks ago she unblocked me. ""Hey, how are you?"" the pleasantries were short.. ""Can you please help me unlock these phones I have? I'll pay you, they were used as collateral""... I knew what was up. I said I would but strung her along. Finally I hit her up for some shit, which was probably the whole reason she said ""I have phones I need you to unlock they were for collateral"". So I met up with her, she was staying at a sketch ass motel. I forgot to mention, I checked and she was a fugitive from parole. while her boyfriend was on parole. So when I got there there were fucking cops in the parking lot. I left, but called her and was like ""yo there's cops everywhere, I had to leave where you at?"" She finally came,down with her crazy possesive dope boy-friend. ""He won't get in your car but I will, did you,get me the dogs I asked for? So you are doing shit now Usama? That's stupid"" 

Anyways, a couple of days later my friend told me ""Bro did you know EXSNAme told everyone of her friends you were the greatest in bed? Like she said you rocked her world. I was hanging out with Alexis and she was telling me how EXSNAME was raving about how good you dick is"".... well I liked Alexis's Facebook picture and was like ""dann you look good"".. she messaged me and we started talking for a couple of days. 

Then last Saturday she called me at like 9pm ""Usama, what are you doing? I'm at Mike's house. He's stoned and I want you to come over""... got a ride over, talked shit about my ex with her. Turns out my ex stole her dope boy friend. badabing badaboom next thing you know I am making out with her and finger banging her. Only problem we were at Mike's house and he was passed out in the other room. She was moaning so fucking loud, I gave her three orgasms but the bitch didn't even give me a hand job. 

Its an unfinished conquest now and I won't be able to rest until I bust a nut balls deep.

But the next day my ex breaks up with her boyfriend and hits me up. Word got back to her. But two hours later she got arrested. Jealousy makes you act crazy and I think the fact that I fingerbanged her ex best friend made her crazy. I know that probably isn't what got her arrested, but I will jerk off mentally to the idea, because karma is a ruthless bitch.

Anyways TL;DR: I am doing pretty decent, hooked up with my ex's ex BFF and she broke up with her BF possibly because of it and then went to jail.

I can't wait for the next sob letter.",1508778120.0
788sz6,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/788sz6/life_after_heroin_2_still_kickin/,22,https://redd.it/788sz6,slam_grippit,Life After Heroin 2: Still Kickin',"Lol about 10 months ago I made a post titled ""Life After Heroin"" introducing myself and giving a little insight into what I have been through in my heroin addiction. This is a little update I guess.

Long story short, I was a desperate addict who after years of running, many OD's (the last being near-fatal with me being in a coma for 8 days and hospitalized for 20+) and having to learn how to walk again because of a resulting stroke, I was finally done. I couldn't take it anymore. So I started the methadone program August 15, 2016, and since then I haven't touched any other opiates. For a little while I was also still using and injecting cocaine and meth occasionally, and I still was when I wrote ""Life After Heroin."" Well, June 5, 2017 my first child was born. A baby boy we named Jacob. 

Since he was born I haven't touched any hard drugs. I smoke weed everyday, and have taken psychedelics but I have no desire to put myself and my family through any more torment. My life has been a wild, crazy roller coaster ride, but it finally has slowed down into a gentler, more peaceful coast and I couldn't be any happier. I have my beautiful girlfriend, my little miracle of a son, a great relationship with my family, and life is good. 

I never thought that a year and a half ago I would be where I am today. I thought I would always be a junkie, for the rest of my probably short life. I just want people to know that it does get better and there are so many ways to get help. There's always AA or NA but if they don't work for you, there's MAT programs, there's vivitrol, there's sooo many resources our there. Don't wait until it's too late. I've lost so many friends it's absolutely ridiculous. If you are struggling, don't give up hope. It always is the hardest in the beginning. 

And don't listen to the haters who say ""methadone and subs aren't recovery"" because A) it's better than dying and B) Who gives a fuck what some loser thinks? Worry about yourself, not the opinions of someone who doesn't matter. Methadone saved my life and works amazingly for me. It may or may not work for you, but if you exhausted every other option, give it a shot. And don't worry about being ""clean"" there's nothing wrong with weed and booze, and even occasional other drugs. Just stay away from the shit that will kill you.

I know that showering can be an issue, especially when there are more pressing matters... And I know that multiple people experience the distinct smell of withdrawal. But what I wanted to ask is whether anyone noticed a continuous change in body odor since using. One thing is that I sweat more, but today I think someone chose to not sit next to me when I was studying at the library and judging from his facial expression it was bc of some (my?) smell. Before that, a girl made a sharp turn and sat down at the next table instead of sitting down next to me. After that I went to the bathroom and washed up as thoroughly as possible, covered myself in deodorant and that guy STILL made that  weird face and left after 10mins. 

This makes me super self conscious. I showered yesterday and even tho I was sweating to a disgusting extent before my morphine kicked in this morning (cranked up my tolerance by using heavily on top lately), it shouldn't smell that bad after a couple of hours, right? it can't be that long since this developed, no one has been putting soap in my pocket or kept distance. Not a sign until a few days ago when I first suspected that I smell weird. I've been using opiates for about 6yrs, why is this happening now? Opiates make me miss my period, like not occasionally but consistently since I've been using. Does anyone know if a change in hormones could be the culprit? Couldn't find anything opiate related on that. 



the thing is that I don't really smell anything myself! I know that smoking cigs doesn't help, but if it's that strong a smell that people just leave I should notice... I mean, during wd's I'm fucking disgusted with my own smell but right now I can't really locate what smells where. I imagine that I got one or the other whiff of a stink when concentrating, but I can't locate the source and I can't smell it the whole time. &As a girl I never really had any issues with body odor. When I googled this I read of multiple opiate users who noticed a change in their body odor for months after(!) getting clean! But not much about being smelly when using regularly. 


Anyone any experiences, ideas or something consoling to say? Am I just paranoid or is this a thing? I write an exam tomorrow and I can't concentrate. Just got home and feel like hiding under a rock or rather in the shower and drowning myself there (I'd use a bathtub but we don't have one). 



So yeah, sorry if that's tmi and super gross, but I don't know where to turn with this... Obv I don't want to ask anyone directly if they think I stink (sick rhyme, I know)

I realized that was one of the few good things I've seen actually go down to combat this whole epidemic, everything else just goes to prove that those in charge literally have the mental capacity of a soggy bagel.

I'm young, yeah, but the stigmatization is very strong right now. There are media outlets that work to combat that, but with the way 21st century America is designed, those on top are really the only ones who have a say. A lot of recovered addicts have great ideas on what to do, us here on the sub have a pretty good general understanding. The problem is an addict will never be allowed In a position of power, and any sort of government regulation of heroin probably won't happen for a long ass time, if at all. 

I mean shit, if there are holes in this idea please poke your finger through them to let me know, but I think the first step is harm reduction. If this generation of addicts could be in a way prescribed  pharmaceutical grade heroin or given access to safe injection sites, which hopefully would be all over, the death toll would be way lowered. Narcan should be handed out like candy, and it should be an easy process to get your fix to give addicts incentive to go this route. Social workers in every injection site, and once the majority of this generation is getting it's fix from the government, there would be focus on eliminating cartels while they're losing money to this pharmaceutical heroin system. 

Once heroin availability on the streets is miniscule because of a lack of suppliers/manufacturers, all addicts would be tapered down and let off. No heroin in the streets and addicts are now recovered addicts. A couple generations later the number of abusers is drastically lowered. 

I know I'm missing a few key factors, like I didn't even touch the role prescription pills play, but you get my point. So with all these things we can do, why is mass incarceration still the answer that's chosen, though blatantly wrong?

For those of you who saw my post that I said I wasn't going to keep up from Friday night (about my bust at my job sight, if you didn't see it I'm sorry but I can't risk telling the situation again), I talked to a couple attorneys. One said I'd likely definitely go to jail for awhile, and the other said I'll likely be fine, everything will be knocked to a misdemeanor and I'll probably have to do drug court or probation. So yeah I know who I'm hiring. 

So I've had a pistol stuck in my face before, but today was the first time I experienced a shotgun used in the same way. I was chillin at a homies apartment a few hours ago, and I know the people who live there, but I've never been in the place. So we're shooting the shit, just chillin, when this guy who I've never seen before walks in and points a shotgun at all of us. Everyone stands and puts their hands up, but I'm the only one who's suprised. My homies all have blank faces like this happens all the time. One says to the gunman, ""Damn it Devin seriously not today. Like we have shit we're dealing with."" 

Devin, I guess the gunman is Devin, he keeps the gun pointed at us and says, ""Yes today."" My homie starts to walk toward the door, and we follow. He says to Devin ""Well fine but at least leave us some shit this time. You can't expect us to restock anything valuable if you fucking ransack us every week asshole."" And we all go outside and they leave Devin inside. Like what the fuck? So I ask for an explanation, and they're like, ""Yeah he just comes in and robs us at gunpoint every once in awhile, there isn't much we can do because the shotgun is loaded. We knew him in Elementary."" 

I also sold a bunch of meth today and it wasn't planned at all. So yeah that was day. You guys doing okay?",1508919092.0

My sister is 24. My brother is 16. My sister and I both live on our own away from my dad, but my brother alternates stays between my mom and dad's house. I've also posted on r/opiatesrecovery because I'm seeking out as much advice possible. Also, I understand that this is an open community to users and addicts alike, and I am passing absolutely NO judgment toward anybody in this community - I see addiction as a disease and if you're not addicted, you are entitled to make your own life choices. The only reason I'm critical of my dad is because it's actively ruining his life and the lives of his children.

Two nights ago, my brother (16), got fed up with watching my dad sneak away to the utility room in my dad's house and hearing him make ""snorting noises,"" so he did some investigating. He pretty quickly found a white powdery substance, and a tan powdery substance, wrapped in paper and sitting on a kitchen plate, along with razors and straws. He also found a box containing roughly 50 syringes, and we've found fucked up spoons throughout the property in the past. We were pretty sure it was heroin, but have never had exposure to it so weren't positive...

... Until my snoopy little detective brother (proud of him for taking action but concerned about his exposure to this stuff) went through my dad's phone, and found threads of messages referring to ""H,"" ""norcs,"" ""addies,"" ""zanies,"" and ""p's.""

Messages like, ""Mondays suck but they suck more without H,"" and ""Ok heading down for H. The bitch said sorry sold them.""
He also looks awful - crazy messy, he's always randomly coming and going from the house, bill collectors and police are constantly looking for him (his license is suspended and he's recently been caught committing utility theft), and he falls asleep randomly - sometimes mid-conversation or even standing up. So its painfully obvious that he's shooting heroin and consuming countless other opiates, and possibly - from the sounds of other messages mentioning money - trafficking them.

We confronted him about a year ago about what we thought was ""just"" a gambling/opiate addiction and that did not go well. He got super confrontational and it likely would've escalated to a physical confrontation if my hulk of an uncle wasn't there.

I'm just looking for advice on how to go about this. We have no idea what to do but see the only two outcomes to this as death or recovery. Given our past experience intervening, we're weary of repeating that same mistake.

What do we do?

TL;DR: My dad is addicted to heroin and I'm looking for advice on next steps. Also, not judging anybody in this community - just seeking advice from anybody with experience <3",1508900632.0

So may of last year, i got the call that he had oded on H in a gas station bathroom and NO ONE found him for 5 plus hours absolutely broke my heart!

Normally I would take a hydroxyzine and just nod out but I am going to the hospital for a family emergency, might be there a while and don’t want to look suspicious or nasty as I just took a shower, and my family just found out about my drug use.
Can I safely take another Cetirizine? It says not to exceed 1 dose but tons of shit says that. Anyone have any experience?

Then my best friend's brother was an opiate for a year or so and finally went into rehab. His dad and I are extremely close, he is my mentor. He told me for the entire year about him and how it affected him. His son is now out of rehab and is clean for a month or so and lives in a half way house. It completely devastated him when he went into rehab. During our meeting his phone rang and he didn't know, it was his son. That was his once a day call and he broke into tears when he found out for literally hours.

Like I said, I don't have much to say but what you guys are doing isn't worth it, at all. I know its dumb as shit for me to sit here and say how wrong you are because I know that addiction is extremely hard. But for the love of God get into rehab, you will fucking die from this.

I've been back on Buprenorphine (Suboxone / Zubsolv / Subutex) for two weeks, but I know I'm delaying the inevitable: acute withdrawal followed by a long duration of PAWS while the receptors repair.

I'm wondering what to expect from a Bupe withdrawal? I've experienced WD from H and Oxy and I even experienced precipitated WD once when I dosed the Bupe too early, but I've never experienced withdrawal from Bupe. I have heard conflicting stories. Some say that the WD is even worse, since Bupe is a long-acting opiate the acute phase is much longer but just as intense. Some say that WD from Bupe is less intense and the same length of time, maybe one or two days more due to the long acting nature. What was your experience? I'm currently on 5.7mg of Zubsolv which is 8mg of Suboxone a day. I know that is a high jumping off point and I might taper down a bit more first, but seems like jumping off at even 1mg still causes a lot of WD.",1508881367.0

Do you believe it?,"So I remember my friend talking about his girlfriend and how he was afraid to marry her and have kids, because of her ""bad genetics"" being a coke addict. Me, also being an addict, wondered if I should do the world a favor and not reproduce either. I ended up cleaning up and had a good stretch clean for ten years, then life got tough and I relapsed. And it was bad, but too late. I had gotten married and have kids now.

So I was doing research to see how far science has come since I last hit rock bottom. This time around my DoC is opiates, so it has been a struggle unlike I ever experienced before. 

But doing research I see a bunch of research papers about ΔFoSB, and how it is the ""molecular switch"" that gets turned on and turns a normie into an addict. Certain behaviors such a doing drugs, gambling, etc. cause ΔFoSB to become over-expressed in the brain. ΔFoSB is a transcription factor that causes certain genes in your DNA to become expressed that normally or otherwise would not have become expressed. This expression causes your cells in your brain to change causing a ""neuroplastic"" change resulting in the addict who is reward sensitized and obsessed in reward-seeking behaviors. Also, ΔFoSB is extremely stable and has a very very long half life which is why they say ""once an addict always an addict."" Once the switch is ""on"" it pretty much stays on. All future cell divisions have the new genes expressed, so future cells have the addict behavior. Interestingly enough ΔJunD is another transcription factor that seems to be the anti-ΔFosB, so it theoretically could be used to turn the switch back ""off."" Sounds great right? Program a human adeno virus to infect cells in the brain with ΔJunD and turn off the switch. Simple right?

Anyway, I wasn't searching with ""confirmation bias"" trying to justify why I exist, but I stumbled upon an interesting hypothesis as to why addict exist and why we were not weeded out due to natural selection. 

Take a hypothetical society with two farmers. The first farmer is normal and the second farmer is an addict. Both farmers plant one hectare of corn. They both say to themselves: ""that was satisfying and good work, I feel great."" Next growing season the first farmer plants another hectare of corn and says: ""that was just as satisfying as last year. Good work!"" The addict farmer plants one hectare of corn again and says ""hmm, that was good work, but I don't feel as accomplished as last time, I'm going to plant a second hectare of corn."" After planting the second hectare of corn, he now feels satisfied like he did the year prior. 

Who helps push society along better? The farmer content with his one hectare per year of corn, or the addict farmer whose brain is reward sensitized and driven by reward seeking behavior and continues to plant more and more corn each year? So think, people like Elon Musk or Bill Gates could possibly be addicts with over-expressed ΔFoSB, but channeled more positively into work, innovation, etc. That doesn't mean they don't experience some of the negative consequences of addiction like failed marriages from being workaholics.

So what do you think? Do you think we survived natural selection because when channeled positively our addictions make us the best and most dedicated at what we put our mind to, and actually makes good for society? Or no, did these bad genes just make it through evolution due to humans not breeding like lions and gorillas where the alpha male is the one passing long his genes. Our monogamous ways and courtship allowed us to dodge natural selection?

Depression.,"Before I ever got lost at the Warren Inn and took my microwave hostage, I spent a month in the back bedroom at Cheo’s recuperating from my time on the streets.  I had a rash on my legs, which I mentioned before but I never explained how bad it got.  It was a curse from when I beat up that witch and he bit me.  At least that was what I supposed.

Pocking and a slight itch started at the hotel when my mom and sister and grandmother came to get me in the city.  I told you that, but by the time I got to New Mexico, the rash robbed me of sleep.  It tortured me.  It broke my already feeble mind.  My legs and ankles visibly swelled, and three different doctors had no answer.  What I determined to be a secondary staph infection created lesions on my thighs that broke and wept when I lifted anything heavy.  A round of sulfur based antibiotics gave me some relief, but even if the rash wasn’t there to plague my life, there were other things breaking me inside.

The abrupt discontinuation of my daily heroin regimen made me feel everything my body was doing.  My bones’ hard surfaces cut into my aching muscles, pulling and twisting every ligament.  Instead of a spine with vertebra, I had a stack of wooden Jenga blocks ready to fall.  My guts gurgled when I swallowed my saliva.  I imagined my brain’s synaptic firings discharged heat through my ears and caused a dull aching in my eyeballs.  It was as if life had become an electrically charged fence into which I was slowly being pushed. 

My feet shuffled across the floor in the daytime.  Articles of clothing I collected from the streets covered Cheo’s back room in truly psychotic fashion.  I spilled rolling tobacco all over his house and crept around the kitchen at night.  His cupboard’s hinges creaked while his family slept.  Solidified chunks from an expired can of Ensure got stuck between my teeth.  I gagged.  It was my own fault for compulsively looting his dry goods cabinet and eating whatever I found in the dark. 
  
At four every afternoon, I reeled from the horrors I lived on the streets of the city, the belly of hell itself.  Cheo’s wife would talk to me about this or that, but it always ended up with her assuring me that I was okay, that I could recover.  It was like flipping through a book that you knew so well, but evil was written where there had been good.  Blank pages existed where maps of myself had once been drawn, and termites had turned the remaining pieces of parchment into confetti.  

I held my head in my hands.  Who was I?  What had I done?  Something was wrong and worse than ever.  I never cried, but I probably should have.  These were the pains of metamorphosis, which I never could feel on the drugs, but when I was sober, the screams of my own childhood’s murdered innocence echoed inside of my skull. 
 
I thought about my father and the things I did to hurt him.  I thought about my mother and how she threw herself on the bed and cried when I got arrested at the house.  I thought about the failures with my girlfriend and how disgusting I was.  I registered for school and moved into the Warren Inn down in Santa Fe.

Including the loss of my younger brother. Every year for the last 5 years I've made a post here about him on both his birthday and his passing. 


#Today is his birthday. He'd be 27 today. He died when he was 20 of a heroin overdose. If his story can help just one person think twice about his or her addiction then, his death wasn't in vain.


Most importantly, I think his death has saved my life. I rather go through withdrawals than cross the bridge to heroin. A few days ago this was put to the test and I opted for withdrawals. 


Apparently two years ago I set up an auto-email for myself for today. Not because I thought I'd forget today, but because I needed to remind myself that it's all OKAY. I got the year wrong in this auto email. It was supposed to send last year, but it sent this year. I was really surprised to get it today. Here is what it read:

>Dear FutureMe,

>Right now its the middle of June. In 4 months you will be celebrating [BROTHER]'s 26th birthday. Even though he's not around anymore remember the good times and don't forget to take care of yourself because you are loved.

>Xo,

>You.


It's his 27th birthday today, not 26th and I still miss him immensely. Today is a very complicated day for me. I'm not sure how to feel today. Roughly 3 weeks ago I started seeing someone new. Today is my new boyfriend's birthday. I don't know to feel about it exactly. Today is weird.

For a while even before using the codeine I'd get some oxy as an intranasal treat when I had the $. My oxy source however has moved away and have tried extensively to find a new connect. This has however failed.

The thought has been crossing my mind today that I could pick up idk a 50 bag of H. My country (down under) has an almost non-existent fent problem and objectively snorting pharmaceutical oxycodone really is't too different to snorting (assuming decent quality) heroin. I know where to go if I to decide to grab some. Have cold copped benzos there a number of times and seem to do a great job at blending with them loiterers, eventually having someone hook me up. Been offered gear many times in the past and declined. What are your thoughts on this? Clearly the first advice you'll give me is to simply not do it; head down tomorrow with some $ and buy a sesion-worthy amount of benzodiazepnes. I'm presuming the risks are almost identical to the substances I have been using anyhow and hence the dilemma. The stigma is really having a massive effect; ""Me?! Thinking about buying heroin??!!"", **A surreal feeling yet I have no qualm with filling my nose with oxycodone, MDMA and cocaine.

I guess the appeal is (even if it'ss cut) a cheap amount of diamorphine that will have me sky high for the day or two after. Sounds great right?! Thing is being a mainly codeine user and the occasional use of oxy **feels so much more innocent** than buying **HEROIN**. This feeling and self-doubt may likely persist as it is aspirated through my nasal cavity yet oxy (a drug of similar potency) never had me self-reflecting and hesitating like this.

Like I had an old rig in my bookbag that fell out and she saw it and FLIPPED on me, I told her it was for my diabetes lmfao....

Anyway, I'm laying here in bed, while she is sleeping next to me (bitch always takes up so much of the fucking bed that even if I was tired, I wouldn't even have enough room to get comfortable) and I'm just dying to use....its the only thing on my mind right now. It's the only thing I want to do.

I know it'll throw me back into my addiction as this is the longest that I've gone in two years without using, but for FUCKS SAKE I JUST WANT MY BACK TO STOP HURTING AND BE ABLE TO SLEEP FOR A GOD DAMN MINUTE. I have sleep problems as it is, and I haven't slept in now 3 days straight and when I am able to doze off, it's very short and I wake up sweating my balls off and it makes me feel like shit...my mind is going crazy and idk what to do anymore.

I know that it's my addiction rearing it's ugly ass head and I know the longer that I wait, the easier it will be every day, but for fucks sake it feels like it'll be the only thing on my mind until my disability check hits for the month of November and the first thing I'll do is call my old dboy to get some shit sent in the mail... Already asked him and he said he would do it so there's that...

My back pain is so bad that I seriously could cry just from having to roll over in bed... It's no joke guys. 
Not looking for pity, just trying to put into perspective. 

Well I'm rambling now so I'm gonna smoke another cigarette in this cold ass weather. Much love my opiate family and hopefully either this will pass or I can hold off until November 13th....

Heres the thing. 700mg of codeine gets me to an incredibly euphoric place (I may metabolize it well) but upon deciding to give some H a sniff and having gone through [two ballons pictured here](https://imgur.com/a/UCIWN) I never reached a peak euphoria anywhere close to what I get with codeine which at this stage is still my DOC. 

I started with small keybumps every 20/30 and felt it come on gently. Over the course of just under 3 hours I had sniffed it all and used about a fourth of it rectally. What I experienced was a mellow, mildly euphoric buzz that grew and plateued for a while. Not what I was expecting. **Could it have been low purity and hence 1.5-2 points of impure gear wasnt actually very much?** or **could it be that my excellent codeine metabolism has yielded me qith a higher tolerance than expected?** or **was the rate of intake simply tol slow? Bigger bumps per interval?**

I am picking up some more today and unsure as to what I should get and how I should do it. 2 balloons? 3/4? Start with half of one insufflated or administered rectally?

Also I thank in advance the comments that will tell me not to chase this high but hopefully I wont be in the 1/4 who become dependant. I am curious, and last night disappointed me so Im going for it one last time. Any advice or tips are much appreciated! :)

Many states, including my own, are using involuntary manslaughter laws to charge people who provide drugs that cause a fatal overdose. 


I hadn't seen or heard from him in a couple weeks and I knew that he had a possession case pending, so I checked the local court website to see if he had been picked up on a warrant for that. Much to my surprise, there was a new felony case in his name. 

He had been talking about getting back into the middle-man game again because he was short on cash. Apparently he hooked someone up who then passed away as a result of overdosing on his product. This charge is a first-degree felony with mandatory sentencing of 3-11 years. It's very possible that additional charges will be filed that could bring the sentence up to 20+ years. Bond is set at $250,000. It's likely that he'll never be able to post here again.

I'm not going to post his username, but it's someone who participated in here pretty regularly. Mods: PM me if you're interested in who it is, but I won't make it public without permission.

So just a reminder to all the middlemen out there: I know you need money to support your habit, but be extremely careful about selling to support it. Just because you're not a full-scale dealer doesn't mean you won't face the same consequences. This guy probably made $20 or $40 on this transaction, and now he has a death on his conscience and is looking at a long prison term.

Ok guys, so here goes. My family don't understand how tolerance to opiates work and especially in my case with fentanyl. I was making my own 'home brew' using fentanyl powder, pure, 98% as a nasal spray. 
At first I started using 1ml per mg at a rate of 4ml over 3 days, this increased to 1mg per ml at a rate of 10 ml in a week and so on. After 12 months I was using 2mg per ml at 90ml (3 x20ml bottles of 2mg strength per 1ml = 90mls a day) they don't get the Math involved in my usage so I find it very hard to get them to understand. They also don't understand how rapidly the tolerance increases with something as strong as fentanyl. When I wouldn't have any fent I would try and stay out of withdrawal , I would need 300mg of OxyContin just to function - and I still struggled. Can anyone point me in the direction of any research done on fentanyl abuse, there just doesn't seem to be any research on actual abuse, not just the drug itself used for medical purposes, my situation was far different. 3grams would only last me a month. Not micrograms, grams. If there's anyone who has had experience the same as I have, I would be interested to know, what happened with your tolerance? How high did it get? Are you still using or did you manage to get clean? I'm now on methadone 80mg - for 10 months now. It's been a hard road, and I'm still coming to terms with just how fast my addiction escalated to what it was. The damage, not just to my life, but my body and brain is sad. I feel like an 80 year old, always sore, bones and joints cracking, my legs still ache, I have extreme memory loss - don't know what day it is half the time or what I did 10 minutes ago. I'm irritable and emotional also. What about you?

I developed a 1.5 g a day habit at my worst. I had only ever IVd heroin once and I sincerely didn't like it, it didn't feel any better to me than snorting at all. 

So after snorting everyday for 3 years, now being clean for 4 years and just recently starting again, I've been ordering some .5s and single gs off DNMs and I'm still snorting, no urge to shoot. 

A .5 will last me 10 days, and a g usually lasts me about 2 1/2 to 3 weeks. During that time I'm snorting probably 7+ lines a day and maintaining a constant high. 


Is there anyone else out there who has never made the switch to shooting after snorting for prolonged periods of time? Am I a rare breed? Is there anyone else who tried shooting up and genuinely didn't like it and preferred other ROAs?

For the TL;DR and question about Exalgo 32mg see the bottom of the post! Sorry for the formatting/some grammar, its my first time and it's a lot. If you're interested, you can read my story. I need to get it off my chest.


My first experience with opiates was in senior year of high school in 2012-2013. A friend of my best friend’s younger brother used to steal 4mg Dilaudid from his grandmother. The kid had no clue the price and would go around school trading them for weed or selling them for the ridiculous price of 4$ (a dollar a milligram). We came into contact and I tried a couple but they would always make me throw up and I kind of forgot about them for the first 3 years of college.


Eventually, in 2016 I got a message from a close friend’s SO. She explained that she was living with a cancer patient who has been getting 4mg dilaudid for the past few months and was having issues eating and wanted weed. The nostalgia got the best of me so I agreed to give her a half-ounce for 30 4 mg dilaudids. I knew addicts from highschool that would drool over the opportunity to get something better than cut heroin or shitty perc 5s. I could charge $15 and make my money back at more than 4x the rate I paid for it and then keep the rest for myself.


So that’s what I did. I am terrified of physical addiction so I became very disciplined. For over one year now, every Monday night, I have my dillys. I use 12mg insufflated over the course of 3-4 hours and it floors me like the first time, every single time. I’ve hid this from EVERYONE in my life. Nobody knows. I have a 3.8 GPA in my senior year of college, I work every single day, I workout daily, and it’s my little secret. There’s not an ounce of suspicion from a single soul on this planet.


In July 2017, the woman I was getting it from was talking to her doctor about upping the dosage as she keeps half her script then gives me the other half for weed (talk about economical amirite?). So for the last couple of months she’s been working towards getting 8mg Dilaudid. I’ve been dreaming about the Monday night where I get to try one of these amazing little pieces of euphoria. Well the week finally came. I was waiting on my delivery patiently when I received a message. The script was changed last minute to Exalgo 32mg ER. I can’t afford to do ER, I only have a 4-5 hour window of opportunity every Monday to do my ritual as I have full time college and work. I need my sleep and I need to be able to function.


**TL;DR: Have been insufflating 12mg Dilaudid once weekly for over a year, script is being changed to Exalgo 32mg ER, any way to sniff these/get a similar (SAFE) high when I have a heavy nod at 12mg Dilaudid**


**My question:** Can you crush the Exalgo 32mg, separate the mechanism that makes it an ER pill , and then dose by either weighing the hydromorphone on a .0001 digital scale or eyeing out equal lines? Will ingesting 32mg of extended release hydromorphone orally be dangerous or fatal for someone who nods heavy off of 12mg IR Insufflated over the course of 3-4 hours?",1508971875.0

I had one xanax bar but i let my girl have the whole thing since she had work today and im just sitting here. I took 4mg of sub last night, another 4mg around 11 today, and they don't touch anything. I know ive used them so many times that ive outstayed my welcome. 

I must admit though that i will forever be jealous of some people. You know when people ask how long to wait after getting high to take a sub, and you have that one person with a huge habit who took 8mg 12 hours after their last shot and never even experienced a moment of uncomfortable withdrawals? I want to be you. Sucks when I take 4mg 65 hours after my last shot, and im still throwing up into a shopping bag while sitting on the toilet. 

My pharmacy was nice enough to call me today to tell me that if I dont pick up my gabapentin script by tomorrow at the end of the day they are going to reshelve it. Those would feel like a godsend right now but I have no insurance and still 12 dollars short for my script with no prospects. And the script used to be $3.65 before my insurance cut me off because they had gotten a report that I had worked, which was blatantly untrue.

Anyways load up fire... and boom bang the rush hits me like a fucking ton of bricks so I told my boy to get the Narcan out of my trunk because I can already tell that this might have been too much. Sure enough my boy said after a minute I was out cold not breathing no pulse so he had to hit me with it.

If you use heavy amounts I highly suggest having it on you at all times. I have no death wish and this was a huge reality check for me that I need to make better decisions.

Oh and just a side note I've tested my plugs product it's not laced with shit besides standard cut. It's the ultimate brown for sure.

So my question is, is it normal to feel very queezy and off after you are hit with it? I am functioning okay but feel really off right now. I was out for about (dead) 45 seconds or so.

I took this rift personally and realized how much I'd been lied to all my life...thus, I was now curious about MDMA, heroin, meth, and so on. If I was lied to about something this seemingly harmless, then what else. Being told weed was the devil's lettuce and would consume me and make me crazy like the rest and NOT EVEN ONCE. So the story repeated itself with the rest. MDMA I was overcome with beautiful empathy. Heroin I was simply so relaxed, certainly not consumed. I could totally do this on the weekends and not get addicted....etc. 

Now really to my point. I've been thinking about when/if I have kids. I want to explain to them differently. I want them to know the real horror is not that stuff like heroin you'll hate and be taken right away, but that it just simply feels too good, and thus will slowly subvert all values you previously held it until you become a shell. How to convey this properly though, that there are things in this world that are actually too good for the vast majority of us? Will this notion itself destroy their idea of the holy and the sacred?  What else in our world is even remotely close to where I can compare and won't entice them? And then the problem of explaining the bullshit in the media. How much of parenting is proper sheltering and exposing? Where does the balance lie, if there is one? Do all parents ask themselves these questions?
 
Maybe I'll have them read Pandora's Box and the opium wars? The positive feedback system of addiction and the exponential nature with which it and tolerance increases? The mechanism of how these ""painkillers"" actually block more than just pain? Certainly not 'Just Say No' pamphlets. I hope I'm making sense and would love input. ",1508950831.0

I steal, lie, among an array of other things. But first and foremost I am a drug addict. Maybe not a really disease to most but you haven't been inside my head. It is wildddddd in there. Absolute chaos. I bet you're all wondering how I've been so normal this past year and a half. Suboxone. Fucking miricle drug that it is. A little over three years ago I went to rehab. Insurance decided that ten days in their facility could cure 13 years of addiction and mental stability problems. Hahaha that was fun. I have great parents. They care. About everything. But are blind to my issues because I push them away. I push everyone away. The only person who knows when I'm struggling is John. He always fucking knows. Always. I don't know how. Maybe because he knows me too well. Maybe because he's seen it before. I'm not quite sure to tell you the truth. How tragic to bury a 29 year old young lady who acts as she knows how to fix everything and everyone but can't help herself. How heart wrenching to bury your only daughter who you thought was so well when the only reason she was normal was suboxone. Stolen suboxone. I wish I never encountered drugs. I was 17 maybe 18 when I insufflated my first opiate. It didn't do a damn thing so I moved on to marijuana which is the worst fucking drug ever. For me anyways. Paranoia and the like crept in and I felt as though everyone know. And they did. I'm a private person. I hate being touched. One person and one person only can touch me with out me flinching and saying please get the fuck off me. John. And that took a long time to happen. 
Drugs are my escape from this shitty place that I've made completely on my own. Suicide is not an option as of right now. Mostly because my tolerance is extremely too high for anything to ever touch me. I can not and will not drag others down with me. It's not fair. And yet it is terrifying to do this alone. No one knows.
My life is lovely. White upper middle class young lady with a last name that helps tremendously. Flip your jeep while blackout drunk? Oh, you're so and sos daughter? Let me call him. No charges. Driving down Main Street at 60mph clipping cars and failing a breathalyzer test and ending up cuffed behind my back. The cuffs were loose enough for me to get out of and but back on in front of me. Claustrophobia and all that. The officer was mad but understood. Maybe because I was a trashed young lady and he knew I wasn't going anywhere. Maybe because he knew I was someones daughter. I'm not sure. My mother taught him in daycare. Maybe that's why I was let go. I remember the shackles on my feet and saying to someone they either need to remove the shackles or my four inch stilettos. They opted for the shoes. Protocol I'm guessing. Police are not the bad guys. People breaking the law are. I am the bad guy. Girl. What have you. 
They've had a hold on me for 15 years. 15 years of pretending I'm fine while debating every night on ways to ""accidentally"" die. They're aren't many. 
I was 18 in a summer class for marywood university and met up with a guy named John Kelly. That's all I remember about him. I went to his house to smoke weed because I was the cool girl who was up for anything. It wasn't weed. Not sure what it was nor did I care. An hour later I'm on my back with this guy whose face eludes me to this day. I walked home in a daze that summer afternoon. This was my fault. I went there full well knowing what was about to transpire. Just thought I'd have some say in it. I was a strong take no shit girl who would literally use my words and tell people in the nicest most polite way possible that I'd slit their fucking throats if they hurt any of my friends. And yet here I was being taken advantage of from someone I knew two weeks. I never thought it was rape. Just a stupid position I put myself in once again. It wouldn't be the last time. But it sure as hell would be the last time I didn't fight back. Anyway off subject. 
Drugs have ruled my life for 15 years. Fifteen fucking years. Maybe more counting weed but I'm not into classifying that as an actual drug considering it's danger levels are much less than alcohol and nicotine. Even though it's considered a schedule 1 drug, which by the way ... seriously? Idiots. And yet these people and these pills you keep pushing promising relief from this horrible declining world. And you're stuck. Forever. ",1509091233.0

I want to be mad and call all these other dealers and run around town and get dope that i know I'll be mad I wasted my money on-- but I'm worn out. And he just won't answer. 

I am trying methadone because I've learned a little more about it and have also accepted that it is no different than a form of insulin for a part of my brain that is missing. And i may need it for a while, and I may not. But I'll put it in the doctors hands. If i taper, i taper. If I need a high dose to feel normal, that's that. 

The clinic is in a nice part of town. The staff is very welcoming and the environment is calm. It is open 5am-1230pm. A machine doses it and you drink 3 cups of water after. It costs $16 a day. Eventually you can get 6 take homes, and if longer they make sure you are set up as a transfer. And no matter how many times you quit, you will always be accepted back. My boyfriend met a woman only on 5-10 mg for a decade and gets her months supply. Why is that so bad. It's proven it harms no internal organs. Pregnant woman can take it (and I've seen a woman expecting twins getting it in jail). It's been studied that if someone stays on it 2 weeks, they will likely stay on it 6+ months. You see a counselor once a week included in your $16. It's been around since the 1960s so it's pretty universal even in hospitals. These are all just things I've learned that I thought were cool. And best of all it gives me a reason to get up and brush my teeth everyday and have some fucking motivation. 

Sorry if I'm rambling. I don't know if I'm making the right choice. But I do know that It's my last resort, and it was easier than I thought. It will allow me to immediately focus on the emotional versus the physical withdrawal that can last months to years. Part of my addiction stems from always comparing myself to others. I realized this important piece in my only long term rehab stint. I love hearing positive methadone stories. Then I magnify the negative ones. I saw the people that you can tell want the highest dose, and the one that is just at a normal stable level. My treatment will be my treatment and I guess i am kind of just accepting that it's time and maybe I should stop freaking out about side effects, try to focus on the positive, maybe to avoid those things from happening, and just become healthy again. 

Not having my one last fat shot waiting for me in the morning feels like a blow to my heart. I know that sounds dramatic but it's going to be the worst breakup I'll ever go through. I worry that I'll put my life together with my significant other and have kids and then just as I had a quarter life crisis, then will come the midlife. It's just so hard to accept this is going to be my last shot of dope. But someone told me once that it's crazy but there will be a day you do dope, and then there will be a day you never do dope again. And you can always get it, it's always there.

It was wierd to read back what I wrote in the begining of this week, cos by yesterday - today I got really tired, depressed and hopeless about my life, myself and using.  
I had a conversation with a guy in a place which is like an alternative outpatient program. I go there from time to time to, but sometimes I felt like I have no right to be there (cos I relapsed so man times etc.). So yesterday I was really low. I told him that I don't even know if I want to get clean, or get high or be dead or whatever. I was emotionless in the worse sence. I felt I didn't even deserve self pity anymore. We talked, and he was realy nice and understanding, and I felt a little better. I still had a shot, but decided it to be the last. 
Today wasn't easier. I didn't leave the a house, actually, I didn't do anything today. But I know it's goint to be better. It should be.   
Even if it seems, that the past few years I didn't do much for my recovery, I think the little things added up. I needed this time and these rounds to be where I am now. For eg. I was able to talk about things that are in my head HONESTLY to that guy, and I know I wouldn't be able to do that 2-3 years ago. I also started to trust people around me, listen to their advices, suggestions, while prevoiusly I was just saying 'yes, BUT...'.  
I still don't know if this is going to be my last and finally succesfull attemt to quit, or just another failure, but I don't care. I go ahead, listen to people who are trying to help me. Meanwhile I'm taking my subs and trying to put my life back together.

Went to Rehab. 5 years ago.,"I wandered the streets eating out of trashcans while waiting to come up and get well for the day.  Sunday mornings always moved the slowest, because everyone went to church or slept in after working all week. When I called home desperate for money, This Sunday Morning always played on CBS in the background.  It was warm in my parent’s bedroom on the other side of the payphone receiver, but no matter how tightly I squeezed my eyes and imagined myself back home smelling biscuits and bacon or holding a cup of black coffee, my feet never disappeared with my heart and mind over the line.  They were two cold, wet bricks anchoring me to the miserable reality of life on the streets some 2000 miles away, hungry and sick.

The insides of my sweatshirt sleeves were covered in the crimson stains of old blood that ran down my arms while I tried to find a vein behind a back alley dumpster or in a department store bathroom.  My track marks looked like the lines of a rural highway system on a road map.  They were deep purple and all ran up my arms back towards my blackened, hardened heart slowly rotting from the inside out.

It seemed like there was always a spot on my body where things had gotten hairy in the middle of an injection and I missed the vein.  Sometimes they got infected, but they always hurt.  My friends had bandages or scabs on their necks and faces.  They all had suitcases they carried everywhere they went.  At lunch time, I could be found brazenly asking people dining at pizzerias for a slice, and if they pretended not to hear, I asked louder like they didn’t speak English.  When I laid down behind my dumpster, it would be hard to sleep, and I would get up and walk for hours back to the good ashtrays in town.  I knew where the ashtrays were, like I knew where the payphones were and can’t imagine I ever walked less than ten miles in a day. 

Dealers and junkies on the street all knew me as a guy who got things for people.  It was gratifying to be sought after and known for being a criminal.  People asked me to get them certain clothes or electronic gear in exchange for heroin, and I obliged.  If there was nothing specific to get for a dealer, then I might sell as much as 2000 dollars’ worth of stolen merchandise for a 20-dollar bill to the African cabbies outside of the bus station.

I pretended to be normal when I went into grocery stores to steal food like I had a car and a dog and a girlfriend and another pair of shoes in an apartment close by, and I would get into character using what I imagined was method acting.  The greatest way to project that I wasn’t homeless was to believe it as reality and become one of the customers coming in to get the missing ingredients for tonight’s dinner.  My girlfriend was back at the apartment with my dog.  The smells of yeast and flour in the bakery or bananas and watermelon in the fruit aisles helped me get into character despite my dingy clothes.  Those smells provided one of the only forms of stasis in a life where everything else changed and failed.

A ring of thieves recruited me, and we rode busses around town to hit pharmacies for their allergy medicines and vitamins or Nicorette before we rode out to meet the fence.  The management at different pharmacies knew me and one other kid by name and referred to us as prolific shoplifters, which made us proud.  It was always a good night for us walking away from our efforts with 5 balloons apiece and each other’s company to feel like we belonged to something.  One night I hit the Fred Meyers off the yellow line by myself and got chased through the parking lot before I threatened to stab the men chasing me with my dirty syringe.

It got easier to navigate but rougher in other ways as I burnt bridges or became too well known for stealing at certain stores, and fall would be there soon enough.  It was already late June, so I made plans to go to some Christian rehab in Idaho over a dozen phone calls with my mother.  My cousin would graduate the weekend that I arrived, and my uncle would help me get situated until I got into the program.  She sent me 20 dollars a day in exchange for my promised cooperation, but things were tough anyway.  All the bike cops downtown wanted to arrest me and even knew me by name.  Well, almost knew me by name.

“Mr. Champion is that you?”  It’s actually Chapman, but I knew what the bike officer meant.

“Yes sir.” My friend, Johnny Johnson, and I had a 20-dollar piece of black halfway cooked up in the bottom of an old malt liquor can, and he was showing me how to use one of the big needles to hit the vein next to my femoral artery. We sat in the bushes beside a bridge.

“Okay.  Why don’t you put that beer down and come see me with your friend?” The cop gave us tickets for drinking in public.  Once he left, we recovered the hit in the bottom of the can and did it.

On the 4th of July, I went to watch the fireworks on the Willamette and had a stolen and unopened package of pink high heel insoles in my pocket.  Their product number matched the number on a receipt I found in a trashcan by Pioneer Square, and after the fireworks I went to get the cash back for them.  For some reason the manager wanted my ID and wouldn’t do the exchange for me.  We screamed at each other and threw our hands in the air before I left.  It’s one of the last nights I remember, before I left.  

I had promised my mother that I would cooperate and get on the bus to Idaho when the time came, but I tried to make them send me more money last minute and threatened to not get on the bus.

“Listen to me, Riley!”  My mother spoke in a tone I had not heard much over the years.  “If you don’t get on that bus you can forget about calling me for anything.  Ever.  I’m done with you if you don’t get on that bus!  So do you what you want to!  It doesn’t matter to me!”  She hung up.

It was on a Friday morning, and on a previous phone call, I had threatened my father with becoming a freak that only talked about Jesus to make him doubt the decision to send me there.  He didn’t really care for religion, and I wanted to keep smoking cigarettes, which would not be allowed.  It wasn’t true though.  I would never believe in Jesus Christ.  As far as I was concerned the whole story was fake.  He was a fraud, and I hated him anyway.

For some reason, I got on the bus that morning and felt sad about leaving my place among the thieves and homeless addicts.  Rolling out of town the streets begged me to stay.  Where was I going?  What did Idaho have for me?  My family lived in the streets.  Even if we ripped each other off and didn’t have genes or parents in common we had our suffering to unify us, but now I was leaving.  

I knew cross country bus rides well, and even though this one would only be seven hours, the familiar nostalgia of passing people’s entire lives and their heartaches and their joys and their childhoods and the farms where their daddy’s daddy grew up eight decades before flew by in a few seconds like it was nothing, like it didn’t even matter. So, the scenery changed in the windows like the shapes of a kaleidoscope or the two dimensional props of a play on stage being flipped up, flopped down and rolled away by some invisible crew all the way to Idaho where people ate potatoes I guessed.  The two guys seated together in front of me had been released from some mental/behavioral health facility somewhere in California and were on their ways home.  One of them kept craning his neck and muttering about onions and potatoes.  He asked the pretty girl across the aisle if she had a boyfriend.  She said yes, and he asked

“How long have you had that problem?”

My uncle picked me up with my aunt and took me to eat before buying me some clothes at the Goodwill and dropping me off at the Motel 6 in Idaho with a fresh pack of cigarettes.  It was weird to see my cousin at church on Sunday praying at the altar with the other men in the program, and he prayed on stage before he gave his testimony.  He gave glory to Jesus, and talked about having a God shaped hole in his heart that only God could fill.  I knew then that he was brainwashed.

The next guy spoke in low toned uncertainty about living in his car through winter and drinking bottles of mouthwash.  When the last guy picked up the microphone he enthusiastically howled in joy.  The audience clapped and laughed and cheered him on.  His story was one of hopelessness and a broken family.  Both of his parents were addicted, and besides occasionally staying with his loving grandmother, he lived in detention centers or on the streets.  He told about how the police raided his friends’ tree house and that once he was old enough to go to prison, he went.  Whenever he got out, he went right back.  The love and family provided by the prison gangs and stability of the institutions were things he was comfortable with.  

Some of his old friends went through the program years before and were successful.  They paid for him to go through the ranch, and when his judge let him out, the opportunity terrified him.  On stage, he said he had wanted to “beat on the door of the jail, until they let him back in.”  He talked for 20 minutes, and people in the audience wept openly over what he said.  Many of them had known him since he was a troubled teenager.

That's bullshit.,"Everyone is different obviously and so are habits, but way too many people on here claim that their cold turkey WDs are worse than they really are.  For me at least, going cold turkey off a decent habit is literally what I imagined dying from hard drug withdrawals felt like as I first got into drugs.  A bad detox leaves me completely unable to do anything other than lie in bed puking and shitting in a trash can or on my comforter.  I can't even crawl to the bathroom most of the time.  There's no fucking way I could even get to work in the first place, much less do anything other than lie in the fetal position while people wonder if I am going to die.

As an example, the worst detox ever for me was when I had the best plug for the endo big green morphine 200s.  Dude had a morphine pump in his back, scripts for 15s 30s 60s and 200s which he sold all.  I was getting 25 200s  for $300 and In turn I could get $80 for them or $40 a half which most people got.  I was IVing easily 5 of them a day because I had so many for free after hustling.  This went on for 9 months and fuck me when I ran out I literally would have committed suicide if I had a gun, even with 3 roommates.

I almost died due to dehydration as I could not hold down any more than a few ozs of water each day it seemed and I was shitting every 5 minutes to where I lost 17 lbs of weight in 5 days.  The worst part was I couldn't brush my teeth at all and the taste of residual acidic vomit and bile all through my mouth and throat added an indescribable extra layer of torture, that was seriously awful.  I forget how many IV bags got pumped into me at the hospital, but I have never been that sick since then as I got on subs.

People saying they are in full WDs and that smoking weed helps and they are chain smoking cigs is complete bullshit.  There's no possible way you can inhale smoke at full WD without vomiting.  People going to work in full WD is also bullshit.  You cannot crawl 5 feet to the toilet p, how in the fuck would you even get into your car

78zjix,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/78zjix/update_lucked_out_and_pain_management_and_an/,2,https://redd.it/78zjix,fivedollarbags,Update: Lucked out and pain management and an update on tapering off painkillers and quitting H. With Special Guest “Wow my Doctor is practical and decent”,"Not that my original post had a lot of traction or anything but it helps to talk about this. 

So 2 weeks ago when I went in for my PM refill my doc told me I tested positive for coke and she had to write me a 2 week script instead of 4 weeks so we could reevaluate that day’s test. I was super surprised I didn’t get kicked out on the spot. Still am. 

So this got me kind of mad at myself and I got thinking and decided it was time for me to be done with H and painkillers. (The coke was honestly a one time think for a fraternity alumni tailgate. I had actually done H well after that coke, which I assumed was what she was about to say when she said I tested positive for another substance.)

So I come back today and told her I’m worried about my organs’ health, and then fact that I’m moving to NYC (from FL) come January and I really don’t want my entire move to revolve around “well I have to find new PM and should move after a refill in case it takes a while to find one” 

She totally understood and commended me for wanting to try other methods. I should note that I’ve tried other methods, that’s kind of a big pre requisite to get pain meds (in Florida at least). A 24 year old can’t just walk in and say “shoot my back hurts” and get handed the 120 ten mg norco a month along with the 30 thirty mg Morphine that I get. I had a track record of failed PT, MRIs, X-rays you name it I’ve done it. Not to mention I’ve done 3 procedures with my current PM including nerve burnings and steroid injections. 

She even said that these pills are just a means to an end and if I could operate without them she commended me. 

So I tell her that I’ve been tapering and that I was using marijuana to supplement and to help with the slight slight withdrawals. And I guess here is where she really amazed me. Here I am just 2 weeks out of a “you tested positive for cocaine, Fivedollarbags, we need to monitor you a little closer” and she was okay with me smoking weed. 

We had talked about weed and it’s practicalities for PM before, like before the election, so I knew where she stood both as a citizen and a healthcare provider. 

So I was upfront and told her that the piss test I took today will certainly yield positive results for pot. I do think, for what it’s worth, that if this was a routine Rx refill and I wasn’t saying I want to be done with painkillers that she mayyyyy have had issue with my smoking. But I think since she saw how over them I am and how I want to be done she was kinda like “fuck it that’s fine” 
And I told her too “look I know this sounds so cliche but the truth is I could smoke pot all day every day for 2 years and if I was to stop for a week I would feel nothing. But with these pills if it’s 4 hours past waking up and I haven’t taken my first dose you better believe I’m starting to feel not great” 

And she was totally just like “it’s okay I get it I understand” 

So she wants me to taper a lot slower than I had been doing. Which honestly is for the best because I can’t afford to not be at 100% for work right now. 
But I haven’t used H since I made the decision not to. She has me on 7.5 mg 4x daily rather than the 10mg and we cut my morphine down to 15mg. Next month I’d like to be a bit more aggressive and shoot for like maybe 3 times daily at 5mg and no morphine. 

Anyway, thanks for reading. Also I just remembered and don’t want to go back and edit that she’s not a doctor she’s just a PA but she’s very trusted and loved within the practice. I really wish you guys could all have experiences as positive as I have had with this place. Nothing but support and understanding and no rejection or judgement for being a dumbass.

He couldn't even fucking get through the damn thing without mentioning his greatness. He congratulated himself for never drinking alcohol and for never smoking. Wow, good for you asshole. And of course, he had to talk about the wall. Supposedly the wall is going to prevent 90% of the heroin from entering the states. Ok...sure buddy.

Besides his failures during this announcement, I'm just so depressed because this feels like the end. I have never done heroin but I am an opiate enthusiast. I take pills (well I haven't for about 2 months). Codeine is my favourite and the main thing I used. I need them for pain AND I love them. Not only does it bring sweet relief from the hell of the pain I go through but also it makes everything better and allows me to function normally in my day and actually be happy for the days I take them. 

I live in Canada so the crisis isn't quite the same as it is in the states, but doctors are definitely restricting how much they prescribe opiates. Mine will no longer be prescribing me Tylenol 3s that I get approximately every 4 months. I can't even get fucking tylenol 1s from the pharmacy anymore. I'm not sure how tylenol 1s are going to ruin a person's life or kill me. But ok.

The only thing that brings me joy and pain relief is going to be unavailable. I'm just so fucking depressed. I see no other option than to search around for opiates illegally. Which of course is going to keep getting harder and harder. I have Borderline Personality Disorder and suicide and self-harm is a huge issue for me. It's something that I thought I have been able to put behind me, but no. It's back. And the urge is stronger than ever. 

If I can't get codeine and like just continuing to do it fucking twice a week, I just don't see the point in life anymore. So depressed and I'm just going to cry for the rest of the day.",1509047995.0

I have also been able to have a few weeks here and there fully sober so I totally get the bullshit of withdrawals and I've even come up with my own routine. My last shot was last friday the 20th (8 days ago), then I snorted a tiny amount on sunday the 22nd (6 days ago). I thought sniffing a little wouldn't push me back too far but the withdrawal schedule this time did seem a little more drawn out. Or perhaps this is just natural?

Today I feel OK. I got 4 hours of sleep which is huge since I haven't had any the past week. Im slightly shivery and will sweat easily if I have to move around a lot. Still got diarrhea a bit but the real awefulness of everything is gone -- the incredible restlessness, RLS, sweats chills etc. 

Now say if I were to sniff a tiny line today, where would my withdrawal process restart from, roughly? Will it push my back to those first 4 days of hell or will it leave me where I am and just take longer to wrap up.

I heat up small little piles of powder I dump onto my foil and start inhaling immediately, and keep inhaling a bit after the smoke stops. 

Do you think its better to do these small little piles , or should I be dumping a big pile to kind of mitigate it getting torched as fast? 

Anyone have tips or tricks to get the most out of smoking ECP? 

I wonder if a larger catcher, like the top of a pop bottle rather than a little straw might be a better idea? 


It also occurs to me that the more oxygen I take in with the toke weakens the hit in that it dilutes whatever chemical I am trying to get to interact with my alveolis. So I guess the main goal is to vaporize as much of the active ingredient in my dope without burning it up, and minimize the amount of atmosphere I am inhaling along with it. I worry that I am letting the vapor escape by not inhaling fast/violently enough even though I am collecting almost all of the white smoke that drifts up.

I lay down and start talking to my friend and apparently I passed out while talking to him and I was making a wheezing noise while breathing. And this all happened about 7 mins after I snorted it. So he gets scared , stands me up and he said my eyes were out of focus and I couldn’t stand up straight. So he had to slap me three times to get me up then he walks me to the bathroom and tells me to take a cold shower. I vaguely remember this but I was super dizzy and could barely see , was highly confused and cold lol. The cold shower worked but I just felt sick after that and couldn’t stop nodding off my every time my eyes would close my friend woke me up. So my question for you is what do you think it was?

I've been using opiates for about 8 years now. I started with pain pills like hydrocodone after my knee surgeries and started chasing the high. I would take like 50-80Mg of hydrocodone a day maybe even more. I started building a tolerance and my body would lose the high faster.

Eventually, I stopped taking pain pills and moved onto Kratom for about the last 10 months now for the painkilling properties of it. I understand this is still technically an opiate and I can build a tolerance by taking Kratom.

I decided I wanted to feel an actual opiate high again. I went on the DNM and ordered a gram of black tar heroin. First time doing any kind of H. I did not get high once. I would smoke like a .1-.2 and felt nothing. An hour later I would go back at it again. Over 3 days I didn't feel anything at all.

I did some more research and came to the conclusion that it was some crap H. So then I went back and ordered another gram from a different vendor. His reviews said the stuff worked for other people so I figured it'd work for me. I know I'm chasing the dragon efficiently and getting the smoke and holding it in long enough.

Still nothing. Is the H I got some really shitty stuff, or have I built up a tolerance from taking Kratom? Should I try some #4 or something? I can live without it, and maybe it's a blessing that I didn't get high but dammit i wanted to!

My main concern isn’t the physical withdrawal next week, it’s the mental/cravings in the weeks after it. I hope to stay strong for as long as I can, and if I do end up relapsing I’m going it make sure I only buy enough for a few days and then take a break before buying my next bag.

Also I need advice.,"It's one of those days where I have jack shit going on, but those in my life are all busy. So my plan was to chill on here with you guys, but it's pretty damn slow on here so far so you guys must be doing stuff too. 

To get things going I have a question. So my best friend and I got along great right off the bat. We always say that she's my feminine side, or if I were a girl it would be her, we're basically the same person. She doesn't have any sort of addiction problem, but she's pretty knowledgeable about it. She's helped me out a ton since we met and I've always called her the MVP of my support system. However, self destruction mode is my default, it's honestly all I know, so I couldn't imagine how exhausting it must be to willingly help me through this, but I'm being grateful for what she's done. So this summer it had been crossing my mind that she doesn't have any sort of obligation toward me, but she still puts up with my bullshit. So I had a good talk with her, and basically said that I realise being my best friend is very emotionally taxing, and if she ever needs a break from that side of me I would completely understand. She told me it's definitely not easy but she loves me, knows that I'm more than my addiction, and she'll have my back through thick and thin. This was an incredible relief to hear. 

So it was probably a little over a month ago that I made a phone call her. One thing led to another, and she was just sobbing over the phone and said my self destruction is too much for her and she can't take it anymore, and she needs that distance. I told her I completely understand and wish she had told me earlier. I was under the impression that it was distance from my fatal flaw, but no. Since that phone call I've seen her for maybe 40 minutes total in person, which I've only seen her when she needs me to sell her pot. She pretty much only hits me up for pot, we don't actually talk anymore. 

You guys I miss her so fucking much. A lot of bad shit has started happening since that phone call, and also another a couple other people have dropped me even though I've used heroin only 2 or 3 times in this last month. I can't blame them, but it hurts. I didn't even utilize my support system often, but now that it's basically gone I don't know what to do. I want these people back but they don't want me. I'm trying really hard not get sucked into beating myself up for yet again losing something great in my life to my flaws. Except I didn't even really LOSE them, they actively and consciously made the decision to remove me from their life, and I put them in the position where they felt that necessary. They know I'm clean, but still don't seem to want to see me. How the fuck do I cope with this? It feels terrible and I don't want it to anymore, it's killing me but I don't know how to internally deal with this.

Also love you guys. Happy fun Friday.",1509133017.0

Am I alone in liking long-lasting high of bupe, extended release oxys and the tea that shall not be named?




I really never enjoyed the rush of H or Dilaudid or even insufflated IR oxycodone as much as knowing I'm going to feel good for 8+ hours.




The rush definitely feels good but I could never get over the panic that I had over done it. Especially with H when I was never totally sure of the purity.




I'm not a huge fan of nodding really hard, I hate it when the rush keeps intensifying after I'm where I want to be, but I love the 'glow' for the few hours after I've dosed.




The weird thing is that I think I take after my father in this preference. He was addicted to pharma pills for 20+ years, but never really went above 20-30mg oral at a time.




Ok... this is my last post of the day. I have another one I was thinking about posting about how to maintain 'regularity' while using (I seem to be the only person I know who didn't have that particular problem). But I'll save that for another day and stop spamming this sub.

794iee,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/794iee/as_promisedheres_my_most_frightening_experience/,41,https://redd.it/794iee,Euronymous_Greyjoy,As promised...here's my most frightening experience with $100 worth of H and a cop... (quite long...but worth it),"First, I want to apologize for how long this is going to be.

This was in early October 2014. My girlfriend (who used to post here from time to time...not sure if any of you know her or recognize the name u/frodo_lives) and I were new to heroin. We both had regular scripts for pain meds (vicodin 10 for me, percocet 10 for her), as I had/have a back issue, and she had severe stomach pain (severe IBD with colitis + 3 hernias). A friend of mine introduced us to H when we were both out of our scripts, and she was in immense pain. I attempted to get pills, but couldn't find any. We both were against hopping on the heroin train, but given the amount of pain she was in, we said fuck it. We never really became addicted...it just became like a weekend thing. Bought a bunch for the weekend and have a good time, then stabilize throughout the week.

One weekend in November, we were hanging out, and again she was in quite a bit of pain with no pain meds. Her refill day was about 5 days away. So I asked her if she wanted me to run and get some dope, and of course she said yes. Now, she lived about an hour away from where i live, and that's where I had to go since the only dealer I knew was in my city. So I made the trip, bought $100 worth, and started the hour long trip back to her house.

About halfway through the trip, I began to feel weird. Nauseous as fuck, and a bit drowsy. I did not do a line since I don't like being doped up and driving (especially for such a long trip), and it had been over a week since I had anything, so I wasn't going through withdrawals or anything. I still have no explanation as to what I was feeling. I made the decision to get off on the next exit and find a Speedway to buy a Sprite or 7-Up for my stomach. Once on the exit, I lost control of the car (it had started to rain a bit as well), and ended up slamming into a tree.

My immediate thought was, ""Fuck! I'm fucked!"" since I had $100 worth of heroin in my laptop bag, and the cops are surely going to come. So I began thinking...I'm in a wooded area, it's a single car accident...cops won't be here for at least a few minutes. That gives me enough time to stash the dope in the woods somewhere. And that's when a female cop knocked on my window...

She asked if I was okay and if I had been drinking and all...standard procedure. I explained to her what happened...I was taken out of the car, frisked, and given a breathalyzer, which I absolutely passed. I ended up sitting in the back of her car while she assessed the situation, and called someone to tow my car. It was stuck between two trees, and it was impossible to get out without chainsawing one of the trees. Now, that would upset anyone...losing your car that way, having no transportation, not even knowing what city you're in. But me..? I was just concerned about my stash. She comes back to me and says, ""Well, you obviously won't be able to drive this. Can you get a ride somewhere?"" I told her yes, and then she asked me if there was anything in the car that I needed. ""My phone, and...uhhh...my laptop bag."" She goes to retrieve those items, and I begin to piss my pants (figuratively).

Now...there are two things you should know. One, the heroin I got was in capsules (which is my preferred method...fucking hate baggies), and I had put them in one of my prescription bottles for vicodin. I don't know if any of you are familiar with the bottles that the Target pharmacy uses (or used to use...I think they're CVS now), but they were shaped oddly, and were a dark red color instead of the standard amber. So it's a bit more difficult to actually determine what's in those bottles unless you open it.

The cop comes back to me, and I'm waiting to hear the dreaded question of the $100 worth of heroin I have. She hands me my phone and my laptop bag, and says, ""You know...some of those prescriptions you have in that bag can cause drowsiness. Did you take any of them?"" I also had a blood pressure medication, Zoloft, and Ativan. I said, ""Well yes, but in the morning when I'm supposed to. Haven't taken anything since then."" And then she says...""There was a knife in the car with some blood on it. You know anything about that?""

I had totally forgotten about the knife. What it was (and this is my explanation to her as well) was a pathetic cry for attention/fake suicide attempt. It was my blood on the knife from about a week or so ago. I have Borderline Personality Disorder, and we often resort to threats of suicide when faced with perceived abandonment, and that's what that was. I showed her my pseudo-scars from the ""attempt,"" and told her that I was kept in a psych ward for 3 days, and told her that she could call them to verify if she wanted. She says, ""No, there's no need for that. I believe you. However, I should cite you for OVI because of the prescriptions. But I won't.""

She cited me for failure to operate, handed me her business card, and said I was free to go. At that moment, I suddenly became religious (I'm an atheist), because that had to be divine intervention, yeah? God came down and stopped her from identifying the $100 worth of heroin in my vicodin bottle.

End of the story here...I walked over to a McDonald's and got a Sprite and a McChicken (plain...fuck you mayonaise), and got an Uber to take me the remaining 25 miles or so to the girlfriend's house.

And once I arrived...I told her this story. And then we cut up our lines to snort with that business card that the cop gave me.

I seriously want to write this scene into one of my screenplays, but it's actually been difficult to translate to that format. Once again, I apologize for how long this is. Like I said in the previous thread...I ramble and I love adding unnecessary details. I'm a storyteller, dammit!

What are some of your close calls?

Oh, also...if any of you did know u/frodo_lives from her infrequent posts here, I should tell you that she passed away in March 2016. Not from an overdose or anything drug related. It was her aforementioned stomach issues. It was a stomach rupture (gastric hemorrhage). It's been almost 20 months since she's been gone, and I'm still grieving as if it's only been a day. Love of my life and all. (Sorry for the downer ending, but I figured I'd update about her just in case anyone knew her.)

Recently started spending more time here because you all are more friendly than the onion subs that I started this account for a few years ago. Bored at work so this is just a story/casual conversation starter.





About 5 years ago I was waiting for the subway and stumbled upon about 25 8/2 sub strips scattered like confetti around the ground. I was chipping at the time, and I saw a few choices.





1. Take them all to pharmacy and hope the pharmacy could track who lost them. If I lost a months worth of subs I'd certainly be trying to get a refill.




2. Take it as a sign to quit the pills/boy and take the subs.




3. Look at it as a big come up. Minimum I could sell them for is $15, so $350 would be some nice spending money (for drugs, of course.)





I did a combination of 1 and 2. I took one to the pharmacy closest to the station, told the pharmacist my story. Hopefully one person trying to get clean was helped and the cops were actually forced to believe that they lost their script (even though I'm sure they were trying to sell them or something. the only way they would have ended up on the ground where they were is if something shady went down, and the fact no one had picked them up yet really shocked me.)





This was my first exposure to subs, I liked them as a way to take a tolerance break and save some money/be more functional, and a few years later decided to switch exclusively to subs, which I am on to this day.





Anyway, not really an interesting story, but... what would you do?",1509121238.0

They made it quite clear that I wasn't going to get probation again, so, with a heavy heart, I finally asked for drug court—my last resort.  They were happy to give it to me, and within literally two weeks I had taken the evaluation, been approved, and was being sentenced.  30 months of drug court.

I tried getting off dope on my own, but I was really struggling.  I failed that drop they made me take right after being sentenced, but that was to be expected.  I went before the judge the next week (cuz, you know, I have to go to court every week now) and told him I was having a really hard time getting off heroin, that I was going to fail this drop too, but that I had called the suboxone clinic and was just waiting for a callback.  He was understanding enough, but told me that I would have to be off dope by the next court date.  Okay, no sweat.

They call me two days later and I come in to do all the paperwork and get my script, but something very strange happens next.  I go to the restroom to piss in a cup, come out, and there's some chick standing at the counter.  I don't pay her any mind, but when I go sit back down she whips her head around and starts staring at me like I have 3 heads or someshit.  *The fuck is this bitch staring at?*  I think to myself, and stare back.  *Oh.  oH.  OH fUCKKk.*  It's my old running partner.  Who used to shoot dope with me every day and lived with me in my car for a while.  What the FUCK was she doing here?  This was literally the LAST place I EVER would have expected to see her dopefiend ass.  She sits down next to me, then follows me into the exam room to wait for the doctor together, and we have our exam or whatever together and get our scripts.

Now, this particular clinic has a policy that all new clients must take their first dose in front of nursing staff and wait 2 FUCKING HOURS so they can monitor for side effects—so they wanted us to go across town to fill our scripts, come all the way back, take our first strip, and wait the full 2hrs.  Well, we made it to the pharmacy, but while we were waiting for the scripts decided that was a load of horse shit, and after getting them went to chill at my place instead.  Which turned into a four-hour excursion to go steal some shit from Walmart, sell it, buy dope, shoot said dope, and have sex and I'm pretty sure I heard that she has herpes.  Fucking wonderful.

I stayed on dope all weekend, but I finally did start talking the subs (just like 1mg at a time so I didn't get sick), and I went back to the clinic first thing Monday morning to apologize and give them a story.  Unfortunately, the doctor is a fuckin prick, and I got kicked out.

So, I went to court a couple days later, ready to hopefully pass the drop with like three days clean, but the fuckin judge throws me in jail and I sit there for like 3wks waiting for a bed in residential treatment.  I was pissed AF at first and just wanted to go back home ASAfuckinP to get high, or find some new research chems I could pass the drops with, but I ended up having a seriously fucking AMAZING counselor who made me learn so much about myself, and my behaviors/thought patterns, and I ended up voluntarily staying a couple extra weeks!

So, here I sit today.  I was released last week, and I now have 70 days clean!!!  The longest amount of time I have EVER spent sober, by far.  And it actually feels fucking amazing.  I'm hopeful, and ready to give it my best shot.  And, for the first time in my life, I can actually say that *I love myself*.

Tonight I decided that for my bday I'm buying my last batch of dope.

My dman (basically Mass's ""dope cartel"" head honcho) only deals til 11pm (an hour drive) and I was scheduled to work til 1030 so I told my supervisor that a couple of my friends hit me up and asked me to go out for drinks at 10 for my bday (didn't mention I celebrated it last night lol) he said it was cool. Clocked out, hit the ATM, and hauled my ass down to L-town.
When I got there I called my guy and he gave me an address. took me 10 mins to get there and I start walking looking for the runner. nothing. Tried calling him 11 times (20 mins) before I actually got him to answer and he told me to go to a different address, another 10 minute drive...

I get there, park, then start walking. A couple mins of walking someone walking across the street said ""Brian?""[not real name] to me, so I hopped across the street to catch up with him. When I said ""10 grams"" he told me that he's not the runner but he's waiting too. Damn. 

So we start walking together just talking, offers me a cig which I was more than happy to take, if you're out there, I appreciate the kindness homie. We end up walking back and forth up the street for 15-20 with both of us calling the dman twice each when the runner finally shows up. he buys five, I buy 10, and 4 other people come out of the woodworks to get their fix. 

Anyways, I got mugged earlier this year for $160, so now I always keep my money in separate wads in different pockets in case that happens again. So when I was handing the runner my money, I gave him about 180 instead of 300 because I wanted to make sure I wont buy from this guy again because hes my only hookup and I wanted to make sure he wont sell to me.

So, I shorted the guy 120 ANNNDDDD when I weighed the two bags the first was 5.2 (normal), but I had to check the calibration on my scale after weighing the second. He handed me a bag that was 8.5 GRAMS. I never believed in Junkie Jesus until tonight. I got 13.7 grams of #4 for $180. I felt so lucky that I blew a couple lines in the Welcome To [my state] Center and used that dollar to buy a lotto ticket (haven't bought one in 2+ years). Gunna blow my lines tonight with the ticket then scratch it after waking from my nod lol.

TL;DR Bought some dope for my bday, shorted the runner because reasons, $180 instead of $300. Got home, weighed the bags. Runner gave me 13.7 instead of 10. Developed newfound belief of Junkie Jesus. Oh, and a bunch of extra letters and spaces that didn't really matter.

I may be at a crossroads.,"I couldnt get my occasional treat (being oxy) this past week. And of course the pharmaceutical illusion around oxy makes it feel more benign but I ended up rationalising that snorting street H is pretty much the same thing. Picked up around 1.5 points. Snorted it across a couple hours. Got pretty toasty but didnt really show itself nicer than ny recent high dose codeine habit. Went back the next day and found another guy. Bought around 3 points. Took bigger lines this time and experienced some very solid rushes and a very nice full body high after the last point was railed. Not superior to my previous endeavours by a massive margin but it was a very nice and very clean high.

So here I am two days later and the fact I tried heroin is starting to really hit me. Fucking heroin. I was CWEing medium doses of codeine two months ago. Im looking around at people at work and feeling guilty, shameful, inferior even for having done so. Yet the possibility of procuring more of this deceivingly gentle drug after work still nags at the back of my mind. Ive been indulging in high doses of codeine recently on top of the H experiment and im thinking just use the rest of the clonazepam I have over the next few days and leave opiates behind. Im not experiencing any notable WD or physical dependence bar some tolerance thanks to the codeine so I know this is doable. **But im scared**. Did I really fuck up? Every inch of my being is disgusted at what I did yet the part of me that still sees it as somewhat innocuous says eh why not. Am I doomed to suffer the nagging draw of opiates regardless? **Though it was a great high it wasnt relatively spectacular. Is it true that having tried the big H its hooks are now set in me? This has left me with a feeling of impending doom.** I see how people fall to this drug. Doesnt feel any different to the pharms. Even to the codeine. The thoughts that I could sustainably chip it are present. Where to noww.

*Your thoughts are beyond greatly appreciated. Cheers :)*

Other than that I highly recommend it. 
""You're always chasing the dragon.. chasing the first high. What happens when you catch it?""
One of my favorite quotes from it was a female con whose whole life was destroyed by heroin. From her abscessing and finding maggots in her vein to going to public bathrooms to get toilet water for her syringe because she didn't want to buy a bottle.  She said ""I don't care who you are. How smart you are, or how strong you are. It doesn't care. It's the boss and it's a demanding boss. It will show no mercy and eviscerate your soul. It's ruthless. It calls and you answer. And you WILL bow down."" Powerful stuff. Oh well time to get high now & mellow out lol

Dom said, ‘So you spoke to Jess.’

Alex didn’t know if this was a question or not, so he said, ‘Well she spoke to me. You told her to come at 10 instead of 9. It’s 7 now, and the living room still isn’t cleared.’

‘Yeah we’ll do that in a bit. Was she pissed off? Like I just didn’t want her to be here before everyone else arrived.’

‘Yeah but like, we were both on our way here anyway. I had to leave her in the pub with Shelley and they don’t even know each other that well. When I said I was coming here to help you sort the place out she knew you’d told her to wait on purpose. Which like, why did you say 9 in the first place when you knew we were both coming here to help you with the house?’

Dom exhaled a ribbon of grey-blue smoke, and passed the spliff. Taking it, Alex nodded to the TV and said, ‘Xbox is shit anyway’. 

*
     
‘So like, how long have you been together now?’
     
‘It’s coming up to a year actually. Although I wouldn’t be surprised if it doesn’t last as long as that.’ 
     
Jess had one eye on the toilet door. In the last 10 minutes, two people had entered. 
     
‘Why?’

Jess sort of grunted and said, ‘Because he just doesn’t give a shit about anything. The whole thing’s a fucking freakshow and I don’t want to be a part of it anymore.’

*
    
‘So like, if we keep the furniture there, around the outside of the room, Tom can put his decks here and there’ll be room to dance and put drinks down and stuff.’

‘Sure. So like, with Jess, I mean, what are you going to do? She knows you pretty much don’t want to bother anymore.’

‘Oh man Alex seriously I really don’t wanna talk about it.’ 

Dom had rolled up a square of tin foil into a tube and was breathing through it to test it. Alex tore a new strip of foil from the roll and folded it along a horizontal line, then emptied the pale brown powder at one end, took the tube from Dom, lit the foil from underneath, and inhaled the smoke through the tube in a practised and meticulous process, chasing the now darker brown viscous liquid down the crease of the foil and holding it in his lungs as long as he could without passing out. Then he passed the strip and the tube to Dom and exhaled a thin line of smoke into the centre of the living room, where it was caught by the diminishing evening light and exploded into a bloom of narcotic haze and suddenly the room began to vibrate at the edges because he’d held it in slightly too long and the first pull always made you feel sick and when he saw that Dom was holding the strip and the tube back out to him he took them and repeated the process and the track coming through the Bose was ‘Thievery’ by Arca and the snare pierced his skull lightly but insistently and his body was floating in putty and the taste in his mouth was heavenly bitter and he knew that the party was going to be bad for him.

*

‘Look it’s Christian and Will over there.’ Shelley nodded in their direction and Jess followed her gaze over the bar to where the boys were sitting and she was relieved and said ‘Oh nice, let’s go over.’

The two people from earlier came out of the toilet together and Jess smirked and said, ‘Actually I just need the loo, can you take my drink over?’
     
In the toilet, Jess entered the cubicle and used her foot to hold the door shut because the lock had been removed long ago to prevent exactly the thing she was about to do. Having already perfected the exact manoeuvres required to perform this feat - remove her coke from her bag; tip enough out onto the shelf above the toilet; remove her credit card; chop the powder into two fine long lines; put the coke wrap and the card back in her bag; remove a £20, roll it up, put it up her nose; twist her body around and down while still using her foot to hold the door shut; snort the lines one, two; unroll the £20, and put it back in her bag - the whole procedure took no more than 5 minutes. She knew there was someone waiting for the cubicle so when she emerged she avoided eye contact with whomever it was and the buzz of the dust flying through her body meant she didn’t care anyway.

It's midnight, the time where I sit here alone and go over in my head a million times about how I'm going to get clean. 

How did you all ""come out"" to your parents as a drug addict? I know that's not how everybody's family members found out. It would almost be easier to just get caught then have to come out and say it. This is something I desperately need to do. It will absolutely break my moms heart to find out her little girl is addicted to fentanyl. 

Edited to add: I am looking to hear stories about how you approached the topic with your loved ones or ideas on what I can say to mine. 

I know that I have to tell her and have only decided on it once I knew I was ready to begin the road to recovery. 
I would not consider telling her if my plan was to continue using. ",1509348891.0

What kinds of things should I expect at the appointment and how can I best prepare? When should I use last before the appointment?

Lately I've been really considering getting onto a suboxone program. I have always said I will never do methadone. My opinion of it based off of what I've read is that it will escalate my physical addiction. I'm worried that if I get onto methadone it will sky rocket my tolerance and will be harder to get clean than it is now. From what I've read suboxone would be a better route because it doesn't go into your bones and you can do a faster, easier taper. Most recently I've started to reconsider methadone because I have chronic back pain from a bad car accident back in 2011. The fentanyl definitely does help and I'm wondering if I got on suboxone would it give me any pain relief or should I go with methadone for that reason? My pain is one of the main reasons I started to self medicate with street drugs as anything my specialist prescribed me did not help. 

So yeah, my question is does suboxone give any pain relief or would methadone be a better choice? I don't want to be on either for a long time, definitely not more than a year. 
I will add that I have never been on either before, I have taken one 8mg sub before too soon and was thrown into pw. Thanks ",1509345485.0

So long story short I’ve been doing Fent almost everyday, some weeks every day for about 4-5 weeks straight, and when I’m without it it is *hellish* withdrawal symptoms. So, the past 2 days I’ve been lucky enough to get some flame gray raw! So, the past few days that I’ve been doing the raw I’ve been feeling shitty, and I’m assuming it’s because of the Fent withdrawals. So, when I’m done with this raw, the Fent will without a doubt be out of my system, but do you think I’ll still experience the Fent withdrawals when I’m done with the dope? Like, do you think if I continue riding the Fent withdrawals out with this heroin, it’ll work? Comment with what you guys think, I’m REALLY looking forward to hearing yall’s opinions. 

Secondly, I was wondering if anyone has personally used melatonin during withdrawals to help with sleeping? Considering diphenhydramine gives me, and I know for a fact a lot of other people, restless legs during w/ds, so I was wondering how melatonin would be?

I've been lurking/reading a lot of your posts here, trying to understand addiction and treatment from the user's perspective. One of the things I've noticed in research is that we never ask drug users what works for THEM. I think it's great that you have this forum to warn others about fentanyl, about fake pills, etc. to help others avoid overdoses. I'm wondering what has worked best from your perspective to avoid an overdose?  On a second note (and maybe this is a better question for the recovery subreddit), in your periods of abstinence, what has worked best for you guys in maintaining abstinence?  (This isn't going to be used in research or anything, or written up anywhere - I'm just trying to broaden my own knowledge base because I think user perspective is seriously overlooked).  Thanks everyone.

I waited 24 hours, was feeling really shitty and snorted about 1mg of suboxone. Made me right. Ive been having subs since then, usually only around 1mg a day. Im now feeling pretty normal, good actually.

My question is, have I just kicked the ball further down the road and swapped H for sub? or are they completely different addictions so to speak? If I just stopped taking subs, would I get withdrawals again? I dont know whether just to keep tapering with subs and get as low as possible or just stop completely? I know that both drugs tickle the same receptors, but is my body now no longer dependent on H, but dependent on subs? Either way I'm not going back to taking H, but I cannot be fucked having the restless legs and sleepless nights. Right now I'm sleeping like a baby....

79iog6,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/79iog6/suboxone_induction_question/,14,https://redd.it/79iog6,FlatFootFlewsy,Suboxone Induction Question,"Hey everyone. I'm looking for some advice on how to use suboxone to get clean. This is a long post, but I'd really appreciate any help at all. 

I've read all of the posts I can find on the subreddit about suboxone induction, but could use some reassurance. To that end, I apologize if these are dumb questions. 

Quick background. I've been taking 90-100 mg a day of oxy for several months (and lower doses for a year or so before that). I also usually take 10 grams or so of Kratom at night before bed. Pretty much consistent daily use for a couple of years, interspersed with some days/weeks off with Kratom. 

Roxis haven't been around for a week or so, so I've been getting by on whatever I can find. Here's my usage for the last few days:

Friday: 30 mg roxi in the morning. Two 30 mg morphine XR (orally) throughout the day. 6 grams of Kratom at night. 

Saturday: 30 mg morphine XR in the morning. 60 mg of OxyContin (one and a half of the OP 40s - I chewed them up and sucked on them). 6 grams of Kratom at night)

Sunday: 20 mg OxyContin (one half of an OP 40) at about 11 AM - chewed it up and sucked on it). 30 mg OxyContin (one quarter of an OP 40 chewed up and one half of an OP 40 soaked in coke for a few hours) at about 2:30/3 PM. I will probably take ~ 9 grams of Kratom tonight around 6/7 PM. 

I'd like to start a quick suboxone taper tomorrow. I've been trying to find suboxone for a long time and finally ran across an 8 mg strip yesterday. I know my habit isn't very high compared to others, but I'm addicted and have been on a several month run of 100 mg of roxi per day. I don't really get high on that amount, but it makes me feel normal and I've set a mental block of not going over 100 mg. 

I don't have the money to maintain a habit and I genuinely want to clean up and break free of the habit. I know it's going to be a tough, uphill battle, but it seems like a quick sub taper can help me get through some of the physical w/d so I can focus on the mental/psychological aspects. 

I have a couple questions. 

First, when can I take my first dose of suboxone? As I mentioned above, my last dose was today at 3 PM (30 mg of oxy XR). I'm also going to take about 9 grams of Kratom tonight to sleep around 6/7. 

Based on past experience, I'll wake up sore and with a runny nose/RLS/the runs tomorrow morning. Normally I would take some Kratom to take the edge off, but should I avoid all Kratom tomorrow?

My gut tells me to take no Kratom tomorrow and to take my first dose of sub tomorrow after work around 5 or 6. But if I need to wait longer, I will. I really want to avoid precipitated withdrawal. The extended release nature of the oxy I took today makes me a bit worried, even though I chewed it up and/or soaked it in coke. 

Second, can someone recommend a dosing schedule for me? I.e., what my first dose should be and when I should take it, and how I should use the rest of my strip to taper. 

I was thinking about taking 2 mg tomorrow around 6 PM, but this is my first suboxone experience so I'm not really sure where to start. I only have one 8 mg strip, so I'd like to stretch it out over a few days if I can. 

Third, what kind of feeling should I expect with suboxone? I don't want to get high, I just want to feel normal. 

Fourth, what should I do if I do go into precipitated w/d? Do I just have to ride it out? I don't have access to any opiates for the next week or two at a minimum. 

Thanks so much for reading this long post and the advice. I want to do this right and do it once to get off. The fact that I haven't taken suboxone and the horror stories I've read about precipitated withdrawal just make me nervous. ",1509306681.0

My tolerance has got crazy high and at its peak I was on 250mcg fentanyl patch, with 180mg oxy three times a day, 300mg codeine and as much oramorph as I needed for breakthrough pain.                                                          

I took myself off fentanyl completely by tapering slowly over a year. Weirdly the fent never helped my pain but increased my opiate tolerance hugely and knocked me out with side effects but no relief. I lost three years of my life to that nasty stuff. Oxy has always worked really well for me but I wanted to reduce my dose as much as possible so that it’s as effective as it can be when I have a flare up.                                         

I got off fent completely, dropped to 120mg oxy three times a day, came off codeine completely and reduced my gabapentin dose by 2/3. So far so good, then I have a bad flare up of my condition, and pain was totally out of control. I lost my mind and had a bit of a breakdown and I overdosed. I started popping my oxy 20’s like they were sweeties and one night I took 56 of them, drank about 100ml of oramorph - I didn’t expect to wake up. I was kind of counting on not waking up, but I did.                                  

So over the following week I consistently took 2 or 3 times my usual doses, every night assuming I’d get to a point where I just wouldn’t wake up. That hasn’t happened (and I’m not asking for help committing suicide, I want to be clear about that, but I am now really curious)  so what would it actually take to kill me? I know if I drank or mixed benzos in then it’s much more likely but I always thought a straight massive dose of opioid would do it too.                                                                       

Am I at the mythical top end of opioids where there is no top dose?

No one to talk to and need some wise words. The mental aspect is weighing upon me greatly.,"**EDIT**: Thank You <3 to those who've responded with their perspectives and opinions, I'm feeling better and more hopeful.

Just like every other ""recreational"" opiate user I got sucked in. My first codeine high 4 months ago. The increasing frequencies. Justifications. Dosages. After a week straight of dosing 700mg codeine (and I metabolize it bloody well) I bought **Heroin**, not too different from taking oxycodone right?! Sniffed about .3 a day for three days and then it hit me **like a fully loaded fucking truck** what had happened. Where I was. At a crossroads. I wasn't just getting high anymore **my life was at play** and I posted here about it, been on this sub since I started experimenting and I made the decision to walk away. To take the right turn. Its been about 40 hours since those aforementioned 10 days and physically I am okay. No real withdrawals. But mentally **im struggling with the reality of what I did and have no one to talk to about it**.

Did I seriously fuck up?

Have I tainted my life through this seemingly innocent indulgence that progressed to the point where I did **heroin**? Im baffled.

Im feeling empty with the undertone of impending doom that doing heroin is an act that has tainted me as a person regardless of whether I completely walk away. :(

Im looking around at others and feeling guilty, stupid, ashamed, inferior. **I think of my parents who've always trusted and pushed me to be the best I can be and I cant have that thought alongside the fact I did heroin without locking myself in my room and breaking down**.

Im going to take some clonazepam when I get home as I understand its early in my journey away from opiates but im feeling so overwhelmed mentally. I need some advice . I cant talk to my parents about these anxieties. Telling them their son has done heroin? I literally cry at the thought of such an exchange. I might tell my psychologist when I eventually see him (knows about some of my drug use) but right now I need some people I can relate to, wise words or reassurance I dont know.. I also had a dance with suicidally acute anxiety at the start of the year and the thought of having tainted the progress I have made since is sickening. 

Any thoughts/words or advice are greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance. This sub has been great these past few months and using or not I want to keep around to take and give support in this struggle we all face.

I couldn't be happier.,"At the party I really didn't like her because we got into a little argument where she was trying to justify cheating in a relationship, which I think there's no excuse and as soon as someone cheats the relationship is over, end of discussion. I was with the girl who hosted that party the day before yesterday because we were actually on our way to a party across the water, and girl from party contacted our mutual friend knowing she still hangs with me and asked if I'd talk to her. Her recently ex boyfriend had been using the entire time they were dating and she had no idea. 

Word spread like wild fire in my little town, so even the group's of people that don't fuck with hard drugs but know me always find out that Cujuabled shoots the heroin. I don't anymore, but my point is that I was so happy to see someone going out of there way for this. 

You guys, as the addicts that make up this conversial epidemic, I feel it our responsibility to communicate to the general public what the true nature of this affliction is and rid us of a blatantly closed minded and negative stigma/label/identity. After that party 1 year ago I had the impression that this bitch was someone who held my least favorite personality traits people can adopt and while I heard from friends that she's only a total bitch when she's drunk and I should talk to her sober, I never went out of my way and just assumed she was someone I couldn't get along with. Now she's reaching out and showing something that I've been wanting to see in the general population for a long time - A step back from ego to realize you're uneducated in a particular matter, realizing you can't make any decisions based on that matter without the education, and reaching out to gain that insight. This is absolutely incredible to me and I'm honored that she would reach out to me to try to understand the thought process of her significant other hiding something so big from her. The one person who I thought was doomed to false assumptions and narrow minded thinking is reaching out to me and asking me to give her the tools to wrap her head around something nobody can understand unless they've been there. 

She was also incredibly respectful about asking me, always ending sentences with, ""I really don't want to offend you so I'm sorry if this comes off that way,"" it's like fuck no you're literally restoring my faith in humanity right now. Her plan is to sit down with me, our mutual friend (host of party) with wine sometime between tomorrow and Thursday and ask me questions about what it's like to be a heroin addict. I'm beyond excited and will answer her questions with complete honesty and try to articulate my points as best I can. I might be making too big a deal of this but to me it shows the general population is in fact changing their image of what addiction actually is, and it feels incredible to be a part of that. 

That's all, been meaning to talk to you guys but I've been busy with a lot of exhausting bullshit lately. Peace.",1509417777.0

so i've been dealing with a massive amount of bs involving my knee. it started hurting tuesday or so to where i couldn't sleep, and so i started fucking with boy again more to deal with the pain. eventually it got crappy enough that i went to the ER where the doctor decided to give me a steroid injection, which over the next 24 hours turned into a mrsa infection both on the skin and in the joint, causing what is apparently referred to rather prosaically as a septic joint. i went back to the same ER where some cocky little martin shkreli looking ass douchebag with a haircut he saw in a 90s movie gay club scene insulted me by accusing me of faking and wasting his time, and performed a joint aspiration (like a spinal tap but not on the spine) with no anaesthesia whatsoever (poorly, to boot) aside from one 5/325 norco administered literally 20 seconds beforehand giving it no time to kick in because he was in a rush to get to lunch, and messed it up the first time because he went in to the wrong spot so had to do it all over again. this was one of the worst things i've ever felt. instead of just adding some damn lidocaine and taking his time and doing it right he went pounding and digging away at it like a lunar rabbit making mochi or like many of you beat it to posts of mediocre titties and five vicodins resulting in a substance of much the same clarity and consistency but tinted pink with the blood of the martrys (me, in this case) as I writhed and arched beneath his hamhands and his two assistant douches' pastrami fingers holding me to the table while I implored what remnant of a god I still believe in to deliver either me or him from this world so he would just stop artlessly jamming a fucking 3.5"" 18 gauge needle beneath my kneecap as though my synovial fluid were a brace of succulent oysters.   

speaking of which, i'm fucking starving. i've been here since 8am or so coming down off of a gram of some kind of crack cocaine that was cut with meth and tweaking my fucking ass off considering a gram of methy crack coke is quite a bit to go through when you aren't accustomed to such things. upon entering the waiting room i would have sworn that just around the corner was a massive battery of vintage arcade machines spewing a medley of skrillex's latest shits as every Former Farmer of America stared at me like I had a secret map to the last surviving Cracker Barrel on the entire continent. what led me here, however, was the phone call yesterday that asserted that my knee oysters had yielded mrsa pearls, although phrased in a manner that would have troubled a failing first year biology major to match in inanity and terminally obfuscated cack-handed incompetence.   

i am being threatened with knee surgery on the septic oyster bed which will result in the further withholding of food when all i have eaten since yesterday morning is one package of welch's fruit snacks which apparently come in one flavor of ""what if jell-o tasted like flinstones' vitamins"" and a bag of trail mix which contained exactly one Reese's Piece leaving me with an insatiable craving for more, which will be unfulfillable for the foreseeable future, and once fulfillable nevertheless unfulfilling as Reese's Pieces are one of those things for me that only taste good in amounts smaller than the average of the first 5 prime numbers but impossible to exhibit that level of control over.

Well, I'm not doing that. I'm not here for that. That's not what I'm here for.

(shitpost)","So, I finally got up the courage to make an appointment for suboxone, when they asked me what my insurance company is.  Then they tell me my insurance requires counseling, but that they'll see me if I start counseling within two weeks.  I ask if I could skip insurance and just get prescribed generic buprenorphine and they said no.  I thanked them for their time.

The whole point was to spend less time on my addiction with as few people knowing as possible.   This defeats the whole point.  And yes, if I thought counseling or a shrink could fix me, I probably wouldn't be a drug addict. 

Typical case of perfect (or better) being the enemy of the good.  Any tips on finding a cash-only suboxone clinic?  In the meantime, I guess I'll keep doing fent.  ",1509408618.0

I suck, I know. I was wondering if anyone had any recommendations for a dose to relive the symptoms of withdrawal. I've read to take high doses of gabapentin, but what does that mean? How much exactly? I've taken about 1600 mgs and still feel anxious and shitty.

Any suggestions? Any at all will be helpful. Thanks in advance!

Update: I took 8 400mg pills, which if my math is right, that's 3400 mg. I feel better, but I'm shaky. Hopefully I will sleep, because I have to get my kids up early for school and I have a Dr's appointment. I will get my script tomorrow, so I'll feel better.

Fall2008-Spring2009

I had a room in an apartment.  I kept it pitch black all day and night.  My bare mattress sat against the wall.  Trash and old food stunk, scattered across the floor.  A heavy comforter hung from the curtain rods, and in the corner a reading lamp sat on top of an unplugged TV.  It was the only light in the room, and it focused on the only things that mattered to me: a spoon, a syringe, a lighter and some empty baggies on top of the TV.  Cigarettes and hot spoons melted the black plastic  while I dug around in my forearm searching for a vein.  Sometimes I sprayed the bloody water on the walls.
-------
My room matched my head, rotting trash strewn everywhere, curtains stained with bodily fluids, stink and neglect.  It was full of a black sickness and wherever I went, I painted everything the same color.  Things could be going well, but it would not be long till I turned my life into a mushroom cloud and everything around me into rubble.  Once again, those who loved me would be left to shield their eyes from the shockwave of dust, brains and shrapnel that would otherwise hit them in the face.
--------
I loved to make a mess.
--------

I struggled to order my food in English at the airport in Texas, partly from living in Peru for so long and partly because of the Xanax I took before the flight.  My family stayed positive about my arrival in light of the fact that I barely escaped El Callao with my life and in spite of the fact that things looked to be much as they always were.  They invited Turkey and the rest of the family and friends to see me at the house after 18 months in a foreign country and even longer than that exiled from home by addiction and a generalized lack of civility.  My dad bragged about me to his friend in the pool one night.




“Hey, Eric!  Riley was a street fighter in the ghetto, down in Peru.”  That was an exaggeration, but I had been in a lot of fights.



He always looked for the positive side of things, which was remarkable, because he had someone looking for my dead body in the morgues of Peru's capital city a month before.  As far as he and his friend were concerned I was the kind of person they only read about in books.  He admired the way I rejected societal pretenses and anything I couldn’t justify as having substance, but his heart broke when he saw me living like a slave to chemicals.




“You don’t give into anything!  I look at you and see a resolve I wish I had.  It’s like where does that even come from?  Then you turn around and give your life to pay for your drug dealer’s Cadillac.  It doesn’t make any sense, Riley.  Can’t you see it?”




I was smoking crack and shooting heroin within two weeks of being back home and couldn’t eat Thanksgiving turkey from doing meth.  There were times when my mom would send me to the store to buy three packs of cigarettes with a 20-dollar bill, but I wouldn’t come back for an hour and a half, without cigarettes and without a good reason why.  One night my dad caught me crawling across his bedroom floor to get his wallet out of his jeans, and I put a hole in the kitchen drywall when he screamed for stealing his money.  A week or so after that, he got mad at me while I was still in bed, so when I got up I shattered a 3x6 glass table top and smashed one of his cherished reel to reel players.  Cheo met me in the park that morning, and after a half hour my mom showed up to say that she was done being taken hostage in her own home.  I told her that I hoped she died and called her a b**** and flung an extinguished cigarette butt at her face.






My mom paid a friend from grammar school 450 bucks to rent the back half of his apartment.  She wanted to get me out of the house if nothing else, and my roomate was on an indefinite suspension from his career as a NOPD officer after flashing his badge and beating up a pizza cook when he was drunk one night.  The cop always bought two bags for 100 dollars, but I got three for 120.  He snorted his and looked down on me for shooting mine.  On several occasions, something they used to cut the dope gave me an allergic reaction and caused my hand and arm to swell like a balloon with hives.  I asked my dad if he had any ideas about what might cause my arm to swell like that, but it only made him look worried.







He made a deal with me on a Monday morning behind the clinic: that he would give me 50 bucks a day to stay well until I could get enrolled in the methadone program.  I should have checked into it that day, but I got high and slept through to the next day.  On Tuesday morning, I didn’t even go see him about the 50 bucks.  Instead I broke into their house and stole a big box TV and some jewelry, which the pawnshop wouldn’t take.  I would have to try for another 50 bucks from him.



“You said you were going to find out if I gave you that money!  Now you want more?”  His bottom teeth stuck out of his mouth, and there was a V-shaped crease in his forehead.  Nothing expressed disappointment the way his green eyes could.



“I know.  I’m really sick.”  I sat in the Landcruiser and clutched my stomach with the window rolled halfway down.




“I don’t think I can help you today.  Sorry!”



“Well, then, go get me a bottle of the pink s***!” I put my elbow through the driver side window and cut the wheel all the way to the right.  I ripped my foot off the clutch and slammed onto the gas to spin backwards.  He rolled behind a parked car to protect himself.  The pink stuff was his euthanasia solution for putting animals down.



I spun circles backwards in the gravel parking lot for close to a minute.  Then, I jerked it to a halt and screamed at him through the broken glass that I would drive into the Mississippi river and kill myself that way.   He was on the phone calling 911 as he followed me down to the river behind the levee and back over it again.  When the cops showed up I cooperated.  They used soft restraints, because my hands and arms were bloody and swollen from thrashing around in the vehicle.  The 911 call can be found on YouTube with a search for “A Crooked Line” under the user TungstenMonkey.  First you’ll hear my father talking to the operator, and then you’ll see footage of me getting arrested on the side of his clinic.



My mom and dad found the stuff I had stolen in the back of the LandCruiser but did not press charges.  The hospital sewed me up and required me to spend the night on the psyche ward of Oschner Hospital.  There was nothing they could do for me, and they let me go in the morning.









Somewhere I found a maroon turtleneck and wore it everywhere I went.  My beard had grown bushy and red.  My hair curled and sat thick on top of my head.  My belly pushed the fabric of the turtleneck into grease and cigarette ashes and made it protrude so that Mr. Pibb and cereal fell on it when I ate on my bed at night.  I looked like Zac Galifianakis in that stained turtleneck, but I was always nodding out.




There was some footage of me at the apartment talking about how I didn’t get high anymore, “just well,” but I am nodding out in the shot.  I tried to fold my clothes on the bed but instead I leaned over them, half asleep and rolled them up into wrinkly balls, before putting them into my suitcase.  It was the most absurd thing you’ve ever seen.  I said, “Well I’m a piece of s***, so I hope nobody is too disappointed about that.  I’m a sorry piece of s***.”







I worked as a valet at a hotel and went to work that next Saturday night as usual.  If I made enough money in tips while I was working, I would take off with one of the customer’s cars to score in the ghetto, but that night was not good for me.  My mom’s mom, Grand Mary, let me stay at her apartment 10 blocks away, because I didn’t have the LandCruiser to drive back to my place.




In the morning I woke up with my legs on the wall, and when she came to take the sheets off the couch, she asked me if I wet the bed.

“No.”

“Then why is the sheet so wet?”

“I’m sweating.”

“Why are you sweating?”  She reached out to touch the moisture on my forehead.

“I’m sick.”

“Why are you sick?”

“Um………… I’m sick for heroin.”

“You’re on heroine?”

“Yeah.  I’m on heroine.  I’m sick.”

“Why did you get on heroine, again?”

“I don’t really have a good answer for that, but I get sick, so I can’t really stop.”

“Well, what are you going to do about that?  Isn’t there something you can do?”

“Yes.  I’m supposed to be getting on methadone Tuesday morning.”

“Why wait till Tuesday?”

“That’s when they take people into the program.”

“Hmm.  Well, how are you going to work?”

“I don’t know.  I can’t get anything without money.”

“How much money do you need?”

“Bags go for 50.”

My grandmother went to get her wallet and took me in her Camry to the Conoco in the ghetto before she took me to work.  I was so high at work that I almost got fired.










More and more the place fell apart even though I had started the methadone program.  Dried out chunks of a once stringy slime and mold grew on the dishes piled high in the sink.  There were two vases of dead, brown flowers on the kitchen counter.  Half of a plastic grocery bag had melted to the stove top coils.  I lost my key one day and smashed through the front door window.  Broken glass sat scattered on the floor until I moved out, and the toilet had clogged weeks before I left.  I kept using it anyway, and waste mounded out and above the rim.  The TV sat on a table in the hallway and blocked anyone from getting into my room without some serious maneuvering.  I used a broom to change the channels from bed, and since there was nothing for me in town and no one that wanted me around I talked Cheo into letting me move back to New Mexico with him in a few months.  I’m not sure if he ever actually agreed to it, but that was the plan.





After being on methadone for a couple of months I wanted to wean down for the move back to New Mexico, because I didn’t know where the closest clinic would be or how I would get there.  There was a counselor assigned to my treatment program at the clinic, and he looked terrified to see me at his door asking for counseling.  His button up shirt didn’t fit right, and his bowl cut black hair made him look like Moe Howard.  It was clear that he had no business being an adult, but here he was responsible for helping me get off some seriously addictive chemicals.




“Do you think we could lower my dose, maybe ten milligrams a week, so I can get off the methadone?”  He looked like a first grader without his homework and squirmed in his seat.  He stared at his lap and shuffled the papers on his desk around.  “Um, why don’t you let me make a call?”




He used three fingers to push multiple buttons at a time and struggled to hold his half of the alleged conversation.  I wondered if he was a real man or three Little Rascals on each other’s shoulders pretending to be a grown up.  He seemed lumpy enough.  I expected the tone indicating the phone was off the hook would be coming over the line any minute.  I walked out.





My parents helped me get some suboxone from a dealer.  I took my last dose of methadone on a Monday morning and let half of the orange stop sign shaped suboxone dissolve under my tongue the next morning.  A wave of queasiness rolled up from the soles of my feet.  Another wave rolled down from my goose bumped scalp and met at my quivering stomach.  I became a soggy burrito under my covers.  My muscles burned like I had the flu.  Sleep came in five-minute increments of feverish terror.  There was an invisible piece of hair in my throat, and I let another piece of suboxone dissolve under my tongue.  Nothing changed.  For three days I experienced precipitated withdrawal, which is when a full agonist, such as heroin, is displaced from opioid receptors by an antagonist, such as naloxone.  In other words, if you don’t wait long enough to take suboxone after your last dose of other kinds of opiates, you experience full blown withdrawal, immediately, and for several days, there was nothing I could do about it.  







While I waited to go back to New Mexico I had to move back into my parents for a month after the landlords evicted me.  One morning I saw my dad in the kitchen.  His hair was gray.  He looked tired.  The passing years and his only son had aged him.  I had not slept in a day or two, but I could clearly see the price of my selfishness that day.  Quiet, he walked through the kitchen.  The lines in his face and straight lips said it all.  He cast eyes down, and he stooped.  I was killing him.




The sight of it hit somewhere inside of me I didn’t know existed.  I got a momentary glimpse of the pain he lived with, and it was more than I could take.  For a few hours every time I looked at him I busted up into tears and had to run outside with in fits of uncontrollable sobbing.  He was wounded by my self-destruction.  I had always wanted to hurt him, but now I didn’t know how to turn it off.  I knew it would continue, because inflicting pain was second nature.  It came without thinking.  We were stuck with it, and I cried my eyes out.




He didn’t say much, and I don’t know if he understood what was happening.  Sometimes drug addicts cry for no reason, and I had not been sleeping.  My moods were unstable especially around him, or at least he always noticed the instability.  I weep now, when I remember what he looked like that day.  Stuck with a reality he hated.  He chose to suffer quietly while his guts twisted, and his only son chased an early death.







My last week before Cheo took me back to New Mexico, I maintained my opioid addiction with crumbs of suboxone and talked to people who weren’t there from the meth I was shooting.  Cheo and I were loading up his truck, when I told my dad my new idea for a book.




“I’m going to call it, ‘Bury me in Taos.’”




“Why would you say something like that, Riley? Huh?”




“You know?  There is a lot of beauty in being buried under the shale in a nameless grave on the side of the mountain, so the pigs can eat you.”  I was sincere and enthused.  We both liked to read a guy named B. Traven, a Marxist writer in the earlier part of the 20th century down in Mexico.  He had written of his desire to be buried like that for the pigs, a truly socialist sentiment.  I intended to write it with the Smith-Corona Coronet 12 electric typewriter he gave me a few days before, the most prized physical possession of my life.  My dad didn’t think my idea for a book was so beautiful, but he was happy to see me go with Cheo.

To my father’s dismay, Cheo and I came back at the house a few hours later.  I locked myself up in my sister’s room and dug around in my arm, with a horse needle until blood covered me.  My dad knocked and almost busted down the door before I let him in.  Downstairs in the kitchen my mom fried catfish for my uncle and aunt and Cheo; I freaked out on my dad.





“This is why you can’t be around, Riley.  No matter what you are always upset about something.  The way I look at you and everything else!”




Cheo and I took off and stopped to sleep at a Motel 6.  I wish I could say my behavior reassured Cheo about my coming with him, but I kept talking to translucent figures in the dark of the room and looking out of the window.  When we woke up it was miserably hot and bright, and the reality of the inappropriate sexual proposals I had made over text message before I left sat in my stomach like hot chunks of lead.  The anxiety stuck with me until we got to New Mexico.

I've been steadily addicted to opiates (beginning with Tramadol, moving to Percocet, then oxys, then heroin) for 7. 5 years now. This January I'd went to a detox center and then a 30 day stint at a rehab center. I was prescribed LD Naltrexone and didn't want to be on Suboxone or Methadone because I wanted to be totally free of opiates in my life. 

Well, my Sobriety lasted a few months, but I still found myself depressed and needing to fill some sort of void that I was missing. I was still depressed as fuck and had no interest in much of anything. Inevitably, I found myself back on and off of pills, and didn't take long to get back on heroin. I've temporarily lost custody of my daughter who I'm a single parent to. Lost my house that I was renting and had no choice but to move in with my mom who is a Correctional Officer at our local county jail. I hate myself most of the time, even when I am high. I no longer get that release that I once got when I use. I just feel guilty and shitty.

The counselor today suggested that I get on Suboxone. I really don't want to as I'd like to be clean from all opiates. But after speaking with her, I've come to the conclusion that I've caused my brain to stop producing dopamine and serotonin for years, and I can't expect it to bounce back in just a few weeks or months. When I was in rehab, everyone was so sure that I'd be successful. They all told me that I was gonna be the one that made it and stayed off of drugs. Well I sure as fuck showed them, huh! I'm very good at putting on the show that I'm sure we're ALL familiar with. In the end, I've realized that I am so good I even trick myself.

TL;DR: I'm on drugs, don't wanna be on drugs anymore. Halp.

I've been on Vicodin for 5 years. I had to start filling at a small mom & pop pharmacy. They've been pretty great, the only problem is they started giving me these funky yellow hydros which I immediately noticed a dramatic reduction in pain relief. I asked them about the brand and they kind of brushed it off and said most of their patients ""preferred"" that brand and they've never had a complaint. Plus they get it in bulk... Basically, what they get is what they get and they're not gonna change it for me. 6 months later I'm feeling very stressed. I have a very demanding job and I get drug tested all the time. Medical MJ is against my companies's policies despite state laws so I picked up vaping hoping it would help me. 

At first it was good but something I noticed was an even greater diminishment of the effects of this crappy Vicodin. Now I feel more dependent on the nicotine than I do the Vicodin but on bad days I end up doubling my Vicodin intake just to feel any pain relief at all. Is this a normal interaction of hydrocodone and nicotine? Also is there a chance the Vicodin the pharmacy's giving me is fake? I've checked it several times and it looks real but it's so hard to tell.

I moved in with her and her fiancée (we're polyamorus) a couple weeks back. Thought you guys might enjoy this scene from this morning - 

We'd been broke and unable to score yesterday, but acquired the makings of a goofball this morning. She prepped both of our shots together, then we divided the dose between us and set about doing out business. When trying off, we picked up opposite ends of the same scarf to use.

Months will go by without taking any and then some will fall into my lap and I’ll take them again for a while, so on and so forth. 

I recently had surgery and had most of my prescription left over and started taking them again for no other reason than they make me feel numb. My life is a shit show and it provides an escape I guess. I don’t really take a lot... one pill a day (oxycodone/acetaminophen 5-325). I usually take half a pill in the morning and the other half in the afternoon. 

I have one half left which I will save for tomorrow. I’m just wondering if I will experience any withdrawals once they are all gone. I’ve been taking them daily for the last 10 days, and I’ve read online that you don’t become physically dependent until 2-4 weeks.

I’m just wondering if anyone can give me a little bit of insight on how all of this is going to go down. I’ve kind of been struggling with this on and off thing for a while, but I think I’m lucky with the withdrawals because I can only remember one time where I got really sick and that was years ago. I try to dabble gingerly to avoid being in this situation. Any and all advice is welcome 🙂

For me, when I was 12, I convinced my mom to give me 6 super abusable medications in the house to “flush” for her since they were like a year “expired”. I’ve always been really bad at taking the meds that were prescribed to me so I told her it was an act of revenge. She believed me! That day I got full bottles of codeine, oxycodone, hydrocodone, xanax, ambien and valium. For free! Best score I’ve had to date.

The weirdest shit to me is though, when I went thru w/d I didn't puke... Like at ALL. Ive gone thru w/d before and I was only sniffing and holy fuck it was like I turned a faucet on and water was spewing from both ends. This time and I had been IVing for over a year, every day, using upwards of 1g- a ball a day? Not a problem at all! Only took 4mg of Lope for 2 days to combat the runs too. Mind you, I didn't take any subs or soboxone either... Still have the sweats at night but I have hypertension anyway so I'll chalk it up to that.

Also, my appetite has been insatiable.... I am eating damn near EVERYTHING in sight. I'm pretty sure most of it is ""bored eating"" but I'm also just hungry as fuck too. I can't stop eating and it's weird because I'm a skinny fuck that never had a huge appetite.

Well the ONLY thing that's been bothering me, is that I am having HUUUUUGE cravings to just stick a needle in my arm. I have a bunch of rigs for my diabetes, but no dope. Idc about getting high too badly, but I just want to get my needle fix.

Question for yall is, how do you get over this? How do you satisfy this need to prick yourself and see that ploom of blood when you draw back? I've thought about just even IVing water to get my fix but idk if I should just fight it, or give in even though I'm just IVing water.

Anyway, only two more weeks and I get a fat check of 4 grand and I'm taking a trip back home to NC (recently moved to Southern IL with no plugs at all so I can't cop here of if I can I haven't met anyone) and I haven't decided if I'm going to score or not...


I hope everyone has a good day and keep posting! All I do all day is watch TV and read new posts on this sub and of course eat lmao. Occupies me from the time I get up until I go to sleep.

Happy nods!

I think a lot about opiate addiction and have often wondered about something. I live in a state that has legal marijuana. If the info I have read is correct, legalizing that drug did NOT cause substantially more people to begin using it. Can the same be said for opiates ?
If heroin was somehow ""dispensed"" instead of needing to be obtained on the streets, wouldn't the number of ODs drop dramatically ?  Would a bunch more people become addicted ? It seems the recent ""epidemic"" is characterized by the number of people that are dying from ODs, not by the number of people that are using. 
Perhaps I have over simplified the situation ? Anyways, I'm just curious and would appreciate any insights from actual users.",1509379803.0
