I have recently came across a heroin connection and I can no longer resist. I have shot up before so I don't need a lecture telling me that I will never go back from shooting. I am on Methadone and get take homes. I know there is a blocking effect so I plan on taking around 10mgs of my daily 80mgs for 3 days just so I don't feel like total shit. 

Will 3 days at 10 mgs be a low enough dose and  be long enough to get the full effect of heroin?

My main question is how big of a shot should I do to get an euphoric rush and nod going on? I haven't nodded in WAY too long. My last nod was from 180mgs of morphine, 180mgs of oxycodone and 50mcgs of fentanyl. the pills were done nasally and the fentanyl was cut up and stuck to my gums.

I don't want the heroin to be a waste so any input would be greatly appreciated. ;)",1397637604.0

This sort of thing NEVER happens to me, and I am always SO envious reading these posts. 

That's why I just had to make this post tonight, because not only did this happen to me tonight, but it was absolutely crazy how it did. I usually try to only use on the weekends, both for financial reasons and because I'm an accountant. Now don't get me wrong, I am an absolute BEAST at my job when I'm high (I use roxys and sometimes dilaudid when I can't find roxys, but I only snort so I know it's a huge waste), but because pills are so expensive these days, mine and my SO's habits just aren't financially sustainable, and when I use too often, I screw myself and have to go to work in agony when I run out of money or all of my connects are dry. 

It's been a few days since I used, and I wasn't planning on using until Friday, but I had a very rough day at work. I work in the corporate headquarters of my company, and after the sales guys/technicians left for the day, the owner called a meeting for the execs. They're more than likely going to close one of our facilities. This doesn't effect me in the slightest, which is why they wanted my input as to exactly how much this particular facility up in New England (we're in Florida) is losing per month, but I'm absolutely terrified and devastated for many of the amazing employees we have up north, and what might happen to them should they lose their jobs (many have families and children, and the vast majority of them are excellent people). 

So I get off of work and call my connect, who says she's on the way to the pharmacy to pick up her scripts, and she promises to call me back in an hour. Right on cue, she calls in an hour but alas, has terrible news: the pharmacy, even though she is an older woman (50's-60's) who looks like a soccer mom and has been using the same pharmacy with no issues for years, wants to call her doctor and verify the prescriptions. This normally would be no issue as her prescriptions are legit, but the office was closed, so she was told to return at 9:30am the next day and they would be waiting for her. Needless to say, I was bummed but figured oh well, I can always pick up tomorrow if I'm still feeling the urge. 

My father has had all sorts of back issues since before I was born (I'm 27 now). Slipped discs, pinched nerves, neuropathy... you name it, he has it. He is scripted a ton of 10mg generic roxys (the pink ones) a month, but rarely, if ever, takes them out of fear of becoming addicted. That being said, I could be in the worst of withdrawal and wouldn't even CONSIDER stealing them from him - not only do I absolutely value his trust and love above everything else, but I think I would lose it should he ever run out and find himself in terrible pain, all because of me. 

He is a very careful person, so he collects his empty prescription bottles and removes the labels before discarding them since they contain personal information. His neuropathy prevents him from feeling much through his fingertips, so he asked me to peel them off for him around 8pm, and dumped about 30 bottles on the table (he takes a ton of medication, ranging from BP pills to diabetes pills). I start peeling labels and distinctly hear a rattle in two of the bottles. I thought for sure he heard it also, but somehow, he didn't. I dumped the bottles in the trash and waited an hour for him to pass out so he wouldn't catch me rifling in the trash. 

I pulled the two out that we're rattling and, I shit you not, one contained 7 .5mg Xanax and the other had 4 10mg roxys! I was stunned, absolutely baffled, and couldn't (and still can't) believe my luck. Not only did I find the pills but he had thrown them in the trash, so I got to keep them absolutely GUILT FREE!! Now I'm high as shit at 4am and have to be up at 6:15 for work but I don't even care; I'm going g to revel in this feeling for as long as possible lol. 


Sorry for the wall of text but I'm just so damn stunned and excited and had to share with someone! It still feels like a dream, and I would 100% think my dad set me up, but he is so cool and such an awesome dude that I know he would never even consider doing something like that. I'm in such disbelief over the whole thing. 

So tell me, redditors of /r/opiates, do you have any crazy stories like this? I actually sort of believe that it happened not because I felt down or bad about myself, but because I was feeling bad about the uncertain future of others, and was rewarded for my empathy lol.

I recently moved and this doctor is new to me and as I don't know anyone in pain management in the area can't get a lot of details on her and how she normally is with other patients. 

She's very strict and UAs and pill counts every visit. She continues to fill my Percocet and put me on Butrans as my ER med. While the Butrans didn't do a lot for my pain, it worked WONDERS for my dope cravings and curbed my Percocet consumption as well. Today I went in for my check up and she decided she didn't want me on Butrans anymore and switched me to methadone. 

I'm wondering why? I was a little upset and confused as she told me the reason why was my heart was beating irregularly and I had to go for an EKG which did show arrhythmia. However as an RN I know methadone is much more likely to cause an irregular heartbeat. I'm wondering if the arrhythmia continues what she will try me on next. OxyContin and MS Contin are both out as my prior records showed they were no longer efficient and she took me off the OxyContin herself. 

I am really perplexed. Any thoughts or opinions? Thanks guys. ",1397622403.0

a week or two ago I got a warning from an guy saying the area I go to has been hot, cops/detectives have been setting cameras up everywhere and they are planning a sting/bust, I I brushed it off because me and my girl have been going to the same spot for almost a year, seeing the same dudes that all kno each other and pretty much everthing has been up to par and on point.

anyway while I was at work today, my girl was running some errands in the town over from where we pick up our stuff from. . anyway my girl texted our dboy and said she was close and wanted to pick up 2 buns for us, he said cool and he met up with her on this street in the town which is relatively busy (bodega, corner store, apartment complex), anyway she is on her out and she sees a regular ford explorer following her so she got a little nervous and sped up, the car ended up following her onto the highway and she cut across all the way to left and the explorer was still behind her, next thing ya kno, WOOP WOOP. 

bam, undercover cop, she pulls over and there's 2 cops grilling the shit out of her saying we kno why you're in this area, there should be no reason why a tiny little white girl should be in that kind of neighborhood, we kno you picked up dope, there's drugs in the car etc etc. she obviously denies everything and the cop ends up asking her to lift her sleeves up to look for track marks, me and my girl snort so she wasn't worried. the cop then yanked her out of the car and started harassing her and getting in her face and asking to search her car, she said no and kept on denying them access to search, but for some reason beyond me they searched the car anyway. my girl had 2 buns in the zipper of her wallet inside of her purse which was sitting on the front seat. she was visibly upset and the cop kept harassing her while 3 other under cover cop cars showed up, another explorer, a white jeep Cherokee, and a purple mini van. my girl said to the cops ""I never gave you consent to search"" and the original officer said yes you did and she said no and they went back and forth and the cop word for word said ""even if you didn't, it's my word against yours, who are they gonna believe"" here's are kicker, they didn't find the dope, either they didn't open up her purse or they didn't look in the wallet. they ended up apologizing in a sarcastic way and let her go. huge weight off both of our shoulders. 

basically what I'm trying to get to is, can they get away with this? is there anything we can do? any advice for next time if  this happens again? they were all plain clothed officers and they introduced them selves as ""prosecutors from the so and so county's sheriffs office""

Just a little summary of my first interactions with opiates :),"Hey everybody! Im a noob at opiates, but I have had poppy seed tea many times in the past. It's really strange because I feel like it doesnt have a huge effect on me (maybe its because im using a fairly weak opiate, but I will keep it that way). Its super subtle and feels like a really good stretch for like an hour, then I kind of nod off and wake up over and over again, but it feels pretty good, then I get really itchy. Anyways, I have never gotten addicted because its effects are so subtle, so I am very thankful for that :) Maybe someone could shed some light on this? Or maybe pst just isnt really effective with my body chemistry (after all, drugs effect everyone differently)

Anyways, I used poppy seed tea in the fall last year when I was really down and it kind of just numbed the emotional discomfort and actually allowed me to get back up on my feet (seems like it had the opposite effect on me than for most people). I took a break for like 2 months and had some more in December for like a week, then stopped until now.
Anyways in that time between December and now I got completely mentally addicted to DXM and it was starting to get really bad so I got Poppy seeds since it helped last fall so much, and guess what? I have literally no more desire for DXM! Its a miracle really.

I'm almost out of my 5lbs of poppy seeds and I didnt order more, but I feel alright with that. I just feel like its strange that Im not craving this stuff

I really dont know why i wrote all of this out, but I just really wanted to share with somebody and none of my friends would understand.
I would appreciate some feedback/advice if you think Im playing with fire and headed towards a path of destruction, or as long as I take a few months off in between, i'll be fine dabbling in opiates

Recently found this guy fairly local, was on for 3 days straight, weight good, promptness.....still d boy time.  After phone setting something up he tells me to walk to this block. Give him a little time, head down....get there call him he says ten mins, just kick it with so and so till I get back.  So I proceed to chill with new stranger for about an hour, getting sicker by the minute.  Our conversation went to the route of how hot this block has been, house cross the street got raided a week ago...his house was shot up due to beef (previous owner), whatever whatever.  I probably should mention at this point, I took a nice dose of L when I woke up.  It was starting to take a hold, and I knew d boy wasnt coming correct, so I walk away.  After about 45 mins I needed cigs and went to go get some, knowing I would cruise past the spot and see if d boy ever came around.  No go...., but the stranger I was waiting with holds me up for a min, asking for cigs, change, whathaveyou on a hot block.  In the hour or so I was waiting earlier about 4 of them boys creeped on by.  So I get my cigs and start to get home, only to be pulled over by two boys in blue.  I panic when I see the lights,  okay, no drugs, but oh shit you dumbass...you have ur works.  Toss em under the seat in a rag.  He asks for my info and I give it to him, well knowing my license is suspended.  I wAs pulled for registration/inspection, but both weren't due till tomorrow.  I feel it was due to me leaving a hot area.  Anyway, comes back, says my license is suspended but he cant see for why, (I have a spotless criminal record) so he gives me no static for that, after explaining my court date is coming up and I thought my lawyer had it taken care of.  No big deal.  He then mentions he sees an empty bag possibly for marijuana and now has probable cause to search my car.  Asks if I have anything, I say no....he proceeds while his partner talks to me.  Of course he finds my rigs...and asks if I have any dope in the car....I explain im sick and there is none.  He searches everything and no drugs.  At this point im certain im going to jail, and after intently looking at me ( maybe looking for a good soul inside) he lets me go!!!  No ticket, no nothing, left my works in my car and let me drive off.  Ive always believed ive had people watching over me, and today just solidifies my beliefs.  I never did get to get right, and im feeling pretty shitty right now, but I am home and im a free man.

I'm still in pretty good shape from when I used to give a damn, so I figured it wouldn't be too difficult. Boy was I wrong. The bastard nearly took me under with him, kicking and screaming about how he was going to die. I must have spent half of my energy assuring him that he would be okay and we were going to reach the shore. 

Lifeguards have since told me that if their rescuee started to compromise their safety by attacking them in sheer panic, they would let go of the person. 

I don't know how I did it, but I made it to shore with the poor guy. It took over 10 minutes because of the riptide,  but I couldn't just stand by and let him drown. It was so sad. Everyone was just standing there at the shore, watching the riptide pull him farther away from land.

I don't  mind the questions that are asked daily, and I actually think it's good because all of it is information that is important to know and eventually everyone will see it (hopefully).   

I love giving out advice when I can. It's kind of the same idea as NA/AA where you start to heal yourself by helping others. Whether I am actually any help or not, it makes me feel somewhat better knowing I may have helped someone somewhere.  I also love getting advice from people here. Everyone here is so knowledgeable that I learn something new basically every day. As dumb as it could be, I really do trust the people on here for advice on this dangerous habit. 

The last thing I want to add that I enjoy about this place is the people. People here are so genuine, so intelligent, and so talented. I've seen some fantastic writing here, just absolutely insanely talented writers.  Who would think a bunch of junkies would be so talented.  Besides that I have seen some of the most genuinely empathetic and generous people I've ever seen in my entire life. People who will do everything they can to help out a random internet stranger for absolutely no reason except just to help them. I don't see this to the extent that it happens here anywhere else on this website or even anywhere else on the internet that I know of.  Lastly, most of the people here are so intelligent. It might have something to do with intelligent people being more interested in drugs, or maybe people here are just very intelligent. Idk but either way I see some of the smartest people on this subreddit. 

You guys keep my mind busy when I'm down and out.  You help lift me up when I'm depressed. And just all around give me something to do when I'm stuck feeling shifty or even when I'm feeling great. This really is a great place for a junky to be. I don't know of any other community that is as tight and compassionate as /r/opaites. 

Just wanted to say thanks everyone, I love you guys, you definitely are a form of therapy for me. So thanks for being here and being so awesome. Stay safe everyone. 

TL:DR YOU guys are awesome.

That being said, I have a couple of questions to ask you.  
I've found this bottle of Tramadol HCL 100 mg/ml, oral solution, expired in January 2014. The box says that one erogation equals to 12.5 mg of tramadol.  
So the questions are:  
1) is it safe to take it even if it's expired?  
2) if it is, how much should I take to feel something? Apparently the high off of Tramadol isn't that great but I really want to give it a try.  
3) how should I take it? Directly from the bottle? Mixed with water? With beer? :D  
Any other advice is appreciated.

Thanks, and have a good day.

I tell myself that things aren't that bad because unlike a lot of ""*addicts*"", my life isn't horribly affected in a negative way (for the most part, at least). I'm not homeless, my family hasn't disowned/hates me, I have a 100% clean legal record (all I've ever gotten is a speeding ticket), no diseases, no debt, etc. If I wanted to, I could go to college for free right now. I've been telling myself that I don't want to go to college because it's a waste of money and that I can be successful in life without going to college. Well, I've taken about a year off and have accomplished nothing. I have no job. I have no spending money. As of right now, not a single thing in life is coming my way. No great job opportunities, no success in a desired career (film-making, writing, comedy, journalism), or anything of the sorts. I am at the exact same place, even worse actually, than where I was when I was in school, aiming to continue onto college. I dropped out of community college after about a week and have been doing heroin pretty constantly since then. I've accomplished nothing. I've done nothing special. 

  I'm starting to think that maybe it can't be possible for me to be a ""*successful*"" chipper. Sure, maybe I can be an unhappy, poor, future-less chipper, but what kind of life is that? Being high is fucking awesome, don't get me wrong; but is it worth 40 years of loneliness, poverty, no friends, no success, and disappointment and overall complete lack of happiness? It fucking can't be. If it truly is, there really is no point in living or trying at anything at all (I'm not suicidal or anything like that, don't worry.). If drugs *really* are the BEST thing in life, why work hard and dedicated one's life to anything else? It would still be inferior to drugs. I realize now that the opportunity to become successful and happy with life is dissipating, and that it will not last forever. I have to act now, or surely I will be doomed to a boring, desolate, filthy life.

I've fucked around with pills for around 7 years (recreational drug use actually started with pills) and never had any issues with addiction or WDs until I started on the dope almost 2 years ago. So once I started getting dopesick, I realised that 99% of my WDs were back/leg pain. I pretty much never have any intestinal issues from dopesickness and actually usually not any more depression than normal for me. But these back/leg pains are pretty bad, usually preventing me from sleep or just general comfortability. Recently, my back pain has been increasing, to the point where I actually still feel some pain even after copious amounts of dope. Its to the point where I don't even notice the leg pains because of the amount of pain in my center-lower back. Since I rarely go more than a couple days without dope, I have been putting it off as bad WDs. But recently, like I said, its been constant pain and when I'm at the peak of WDs the pain is so bad it is unbearable unless I take 2000mgs of APAP and 800mgs of NSAIDs at the same time to just take the pain down from a 10 to a 9. Actually told my SO to get ready to take me to the hospital the other night just before I took all that OTC shit because of the enormous amount of pain. I've been racking my mind to figure out if I had taken a fall or something to explain the pain but nothing comes to mind. I'm an avid back-cracker(?) So I was thinking maybe a pinched nerve or something? I just don't know what could be causing the pain because now I'm about 99% sure its not just WDs anymore. I'm open to ideas lol. But I want to go see my doctor but I know for a fact they're pretty much anti-opiate so I think it might be a waste to start there. I was thinking about waiting till the pain hits hardest again and just going to the hospital and see what they say. I'm also worried that they'll just see me as some sort of drug seeker because I'm young (21) with an issue that might seem like I'm lying because I don't really have any type of story to compliment my pain even though its there and really powerful. So I'm looking for anything that I can say/do to try and get this pain worked out. I can honestly say that I mainly use now to keep the pain at bay, not even to get fucked up. Its just so frustrating! I have great insurance so that's not an issue, I just want to get treated right and quickly because I can't take this pain anymore. I'm so sorry for the wall of text, I'm just so frustrated my question kind of turned into a rant. I'm sorry. But please, any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you guys so much, I'm sorry, again, but this is honestly the greatest group of people on the internet and I value all of your opinions. Love you people, and happy nods!",1397711996.0

I was with my friend that sells Roxys and he was making a play to this girl. She gave him these 4 Roxys that she swore up and down were fake. He said they were too bc his friend was the one that sold them to her and he knew he had fake Ms not too long ago. I smoke my Roxys and they say fake pills don't slide or work at all when smoking them, I put one on the foil and it was the exact same as a normal M, tasted the same, slid the same, got me high. Everything. But he told me to quit bc he knew they were fake and didn't want me smoking whatever it was. I told him I swore they weren't fake and it was getting me high so he said then keep them, I don't care just don't do it in front of me. So when I got home I smoked the rest of that one, got high like normal.did another one, gave my boyfriend one who has been clean for 8 days and he got high. Which is the perfect test bc I had already been high today and it COULD have been in my head. But he swares he got high, but they are still swearing there fake.

I really have come to the conclusion that they are really tripping and there real, can't complain about it. Even if they are ""fake"" there doing what I need them to do. Haha.

On December 16th, I went out with a bang. The day before I picked up my final supplies, they were as follows;

3 Bundles (14 bags each) of DOA stamp from Kensington

1 $100 rock of Crack

20 Hydromorphone 8mgs

3 $50 bags of coke

12 10 Mg Valiums

I did Heroin for the first time when I was 16 years old. My Older Brother introduced me to the drug. I got insanely high of snorting just 1 bag, and was instantly in love. Although I liked what I was feeling, I wouldn't touch opiates again until I was 20 years old. I didn't start shooting dope until October 2013. Before that, I would snort everything (including Oxycodone 30 mgs) and enjoyed the high incredibly. The first time I shot dope was also the first night I would do a speedball. 

I was instantly in love with that specific rush. I soon realized I was mimicking all the same behaviors of people who died from a drug overdose. I would hoard my drugs and literally shut my phone off and hang out alone in my room for 3 or 4 days at a time. Whenever I would wake up after a night of doing speedballs, my chest / heart would hurt a lot, and I would hear my heart beat in my ears / ringing constantly. I knew it was just a matter of time, so I threw in the towel and found a place where I could spent 19 days and get my head straight.

There's no way describing how good I felt on days 4 and 5. Colors looked brighter, cigarettes tasted good with coffee, conversations were amazing and I actually felt good. I started putting weight on (the rehab I was at had ice cold chocolate milk 24/7). I knew then that I wasn't just sick of withdrawing, that I was actually sick and disgusted by being high. I felt human again.

Everyday is a different struggle. I have money in my pocket, money in the bank, all my bills are paid, I'm actually able to save money for things I want, which is a laptop with a wireless network card. I'm unable to make meetings everyday, so I go about 2 - 3 times a week. I'm in AA although I never really had a problem with alcohol, but the recovery method makes more sense to me than NA does. I can't lie and say I'm making friends at these meetings, but I am making connections with individuals who are as motivated as I am to stay clean and be happy. I work out everyday, and have put on a good amount of muscle mass in the past 3 months. Every single day of my life is literally better than the last. Most of the people in my life who wrote me off as a druggie are coming back, although some aren't and some thing this is just a ruse. I can't be upset about that, since I spent a long time putting drugs in my body and do not have that much clean time. I named my higher power Zarathustra, and him and I have extensive conversations the last 10 minutes of my day before I go to sleep. I thank him for my gratitudes, and ask him for help with my resentments.

Recovery wasn't the end of the world like I thought it would be. I have so much energy and enthusiasm to attack the day like an enemy, and get as much as possible out of it. I love waking up early and eating breakfast, I like remembering people's names and what they do for a living, I absolutely love not being subservient to the dealer du joir or whomever has the drugs I used to crave.

Whenever this happens, I barely feel any effect from my opiate pain meds when I take them (not for stopping the pain, but the general opiate effects). It's almost like my body isn't metabolizing them like it usually would and a normal dose for me does nothing, except actually make that pain hurt a little more. 

Any ideas of what this could be? Is it possible to have some sort of liver, gallbadder..etc issue where you could take pills and it does absolutely nothing because the organ that's needed to turn it into effects isn't working? The pain is about an inch under my right ribcage. Taking my normal opiate meds actually makes the pain worse and then I also barely feel any opiate effects. ",1397682406.0

One of the reasons I am going down there is to see an old friend who I haven't seen more than twice in the past two years. This is a friend who I used to see everyday, we used to hang out daily smoke weed and get into otherwise pretty harmless late teenage early twenty something shenanigans.

My friend (lets call him Sam) had always had a casual love for percocet that I could never understand (I throw up my guts if I take more than 5 MG) but also didn't seem to really affect him too much. Then Sam meets this bitch (we'll call her Jill). I was never really much of a fan of Jill, I only ever met her twice after they started dating and for months I didn't see my friend again. Whatever I thought, he found some girl he is crazy about I'll be happy for him and hoping the new relationship fuzziness would ware off and he would make time for his friends again. No such thing happened. I heard through the grape vine months latter that Jill had gotten Sam into heroin and that he had gone to rehab after his parents caught him stealing from them.

After Sam gets out of rehab he sent me a text and we got together for coffee to talk. He lays out all the bull shit this relationship with this girl has caused him, from getting him into H to how abusive she was to him and how he had cut off all of his other friends for this evil excuse of a woman. I listen, give my advice, tell him I love him, wish him the best and that if he ever needs a friend please don't hesitate to call. We make plans to get coffee again later that week. Unfortunately every attempt I made to get in contact with him after that was ignored and he just vanished on me.

So flash forward another year. I post something on my facebook about buying my tickets down to LA and come back latter to a message from none other than my vanishing buddy. He tells me he had spent the last year in and out of different rehabs and on and off with this girls. Now his parents had sent him down to California to live with some aunt and uncle and get him away from his current environment as well as the previously mentioned harpy. I got off the phone with him yesterday to talk and catch up and it was awesome, we picked up just like old best friends do. He explained to me how much he hates living down there, regrets everything he had done, how much he misses spending time with all our old friends, and how much he wants to come back home. so obviously we made plans to kick it while I was down there and catch up.

My trouble is I don't really understand how heroin withdraws affect someone. Should I be careful bringing up past stories of what he did to avoid causing triggers? Should I instead ask him about these things to help him work through it? Should I just shut up and try to be his friend like old times like nothing happened or do I just accept that this is part of him and try and help him move on?

This guy is like a brother to me, and I really hate to see him so depressed and in this hole he feels like he has buried himself in. He has a great family who supports him and obviously some friends who care. We just want him to be alright and after he vanished on me after our last talk I'm worried that he might do the same thing.

I've done blow and plenty of other shit but I have never seen anything grab anyone like this did to him, and I just don't understand the mindset of a recovering heroin addict so it is hard for me to identify or give good advice in my opinion.

What happens next, right after we die.

Does our mind break free, from this physical realm
Will we ever know peace, only time can tell.

Will there still be a me? What about I?
What happens to the self, the ego, the mind.

The answer to this, I know where it lies.
The observer, the beholder, the subjective eye.

It's troubling to think, 
That this ship will soon sink,
And then gently fade away.

Oblivion knows, where our mind shall go,
only, once, we die.

My boyfriend's little brother got out of jail this week, and of course stopped by to stay for the weekend. He used to have a crazy habit but he's been clean for four months. We re upped to get back on deck and it was new gear. Way way stronger than our previous supply. 

Lil bro, against my advise and my judgement, wanted a shot. He asked me to keep an eye on him, which I should have paid more attention to, but I had my hands full with my boyfriend and I. 

I looked back no more than two, three minutes later, fighting a powerful nod, and he was grey and blue lipped. When I ran over and grabbed him, dead weight. Gone. Just like that. We did chest compressions and he started breathing, but his pulse was weak and barely there. He mumbled something about the edge, and then he stopped breathing again. His pulse flickered away and for another minute we fought to get him breathing again. He did. It was harder to get him back the second time but we are very fortunate we did. 

The line that separates you from the ground is fainter than you think. Last week I was the unfortunate witness to the murder of two people. We don't see very often, but it's always there. We live in this bubble thinking we are safe. You're not. Please, people, take your time and be careful. You can always get a little bit higher. You can never be a little less, if it's already done. 

I hope everyone takes this to heart, without having to come as close as we have, but you never really get it until you Fuck up somehow. 

I wish you all well. And never forget to do your test shots. You can never regret being cautious. There is nothing safe about being a heroin user.

Prior to this, I've been a very successful chipper for the past decade.

I just kept making better connects - I'm a good, regular customer with a steady income - & eventually, found myself able to find a little bit of everything. 

Finally got hooked up with a hot connect & bought a few buns. I was trying not to use H more than a couple of times a week, but would take pill after pill on those 'days off'. About a week ago I put in an order with 2 different connects for way too many chemicals. But, I never picked up any of it. I took some pills Monday at 5pm, & decided about 40 minutes later I was going to try to get clean.

About a month ago, I met someone in line at a gas station near my house. We connected immediately & started talking. Our convo just kept going,  & he started telling me about his junkie past & current recovery. We exchanged numbers & went our separate ways. Eventually we started texting & I confessed my drug use. Instantly, he wants to help me get clean. Starts encouraging me, offering me help getting subs, listening to my bullshit.

The best thing this person has done is be honest & call me out on my lies. He's been exactly where I am - he knows every excuse, every lie, he sees right through my shit. I love it.

Called him last week to tell him, emphatically, that I found what I'd been wanting & I was going to pickup.  I promised him I would seriously attempt to clean ""after this one last score"" & he responded, ""you do know I've heard that shit from you multiple times now right"". 

I froze.  My stupidity suddenly hit me like a ton of bricks. 

This was the one person in the world I was being honest with, one random person who was selflessly trying to help me just because, & I was starting to make him not trust me. Just like everyone else in my life.

So, 12 minutes after he text me that response, I decided to not take any more drugs.

I'm now taking suboxone & plan to reduce my dose everyday for about ten days & then stop completely. I already feel better & I'm starting to communicate with my family again.

I really believe credit is due to this stranger, who reached out & believed in me when everyone had no choice but to have given up. He was honest, gritty & tough with me and it was exactly what I needed. He related to me, & knew how to reason with the addict inside me.

I love this sub-reddit & I'll always be lurking :) but for now, I'm clean.",1397939797.0

You know that recently I have been having major pain in my back 24/7. I had been thinking at first it was just bad WDs until recently I started feeling the pain even when I'm on decent amounts of dope (insufflation). So I've been using recently to just ease my pain because I'm finding it hard to function without it. With a little research I think I have a herniated disc. Well I bought two bags last night with .6 each, so 1.2 total. Well I popped 3 xannies to help me sleep but I know before I did that I had one bag left buried deep in my wallet to where, unless you were trying to get it out, it would never just fall out. So last thing I remember was looking for this lost bag. My girl kept saying she didn't take it or seen it. I looked in/out the car, tearing everything up. And I know she must had at least done something with it or at least dropped it herself because as I stated, it would never just ""fall out"" of my wallet. But by this time, the xanax kicked in and its blackout from there. Fast forward to this morning, I wake up in excruciating pain, and ask my girl if she ever found the bag. She says yea, her dad found it in the drive way and opened it up and sprinkled it all over the ground and poured water over it so it was un-retrievable. A whole .6 bag, which costs $75 around here. And it was some fire dope. I hate this mother fucker with every ounce of my being now. But then again. My girl could be playing me the whole time, I'm not even sure because it is something she would do, especially since she was mad at me in the first place and now she all happy and everything while I'm in umbearable pain. I'm sorry everyone. I just needed to vent because not only am I out $75, but I'm in escruciating pain, I'm so blown. ",1397930855.0

I have never posted before and to be honest I don't even know why I am posting today. For some reason I just felt inclined to do so. This sub has some of the coolest folks in it and many of the posts I have read have helped me out on more than one occasion. So I suppose that's why I wanted to say something if only this one time.
      I have been using opiates for the last 5 years, ( starting with oxy 10's and 15""s for about a year until until I switched to 30's and opanas and the lastly I started IV use of H which I have been using for the last 2 years.
      Me and my girl started using H together. We both had been using pills before we got together and then after. We tried H together for the first time and then we didn't look back, you all know how that goes. Well due to some unfortunate events I had to move back my home town and she had to go to rehab. Now she is in a halfway house and doing great. I am so proud of her. Well last night she broke up with me and I can't say I blame her. She has too much on her plate right now without having to worry about me. 
     I really want to quit using which I plan to do tomorrow. So today is my last day using and I only had money for 3 caps of scram. ( for all those that don't know what that is its dope but cut in a different way then most of the country. Its what we gat around here within 80 miles of Baltimore.) 
     So I guess that's another reason for my first and last post. Quitting tomorrow means I won't frequent this sub like I usually do because it is hard for me to look at pics of H and listen to stories about it when my nose is running, legs are shaking and all I want to do is use but telling myself I won't. Thankyou all for the funny, sad, and entertaining stories and advice that I am so used to reading everyday. I wish everyone the best and I hope that everybody has a great weekend and Easter. Wish me luck because I know that this is going to be a tough next couple weeks. I am doing it cold turkey with nothing to help me out.

so basically getting right to the point, tonight is going to be me and my girls last night, hopefully, doing dope. we picked up a brick for 160 of some good shit that we've been getting for the last 2 weeks and it's been consistent. we picked up methadone earlier this week because I think it's time to throw in the towel. things have been getting way too hot in north jersey and there's been way too many close calls. I think the final straw was my girl getting pulled over and harassed but being let go. there's too much at risk for us with both of our families and we are sick and tired of being sick and tired. we got plenty of methadone(pills), klonopins, clonodine, more than a few Xanax bars, some lope and some sleep stuff. I've been lurking for years and only recently started posting. I had a few more posts but I had to delete them out of paranoia of my brother finding them but the point is you guys always had great advice, always made me feel welcomed, made me feel like a brother, always made me laugh and best of all, you guys were here when I had no one else.

I stopped three weeks ago which also happens to be the same time I started Zoloft for depression and social anxiety. 

The good news is the Zoloft is doing wonders for my depression. Not so much my anxiety but the motivation it's given me is like nothing I've felt in a very long time.

The bad fucking news? I bought a bun yesterday and prepared WAY to big of a shot. I was shaking and it was like I was back in full dependance mode. I just instinctively loaded the same shot I always did! One of the stupider things I've ever done in retrospect. Can you guess what happened? NOTHING. I felt a little relaxed but no rush!!

Turns out Sertraline inhibits an enzyme used in metabolizing opiates. Some people report loss of euphoria and high but not all. Just my luck, I finally go more than a week without and am greeted with nothing on the other side.  

I know I should be happy I have this new motivation and reason to not use but I can't help feeling really disappointed. :(",1398047390.0

After looking into it a bit I would urge everybody who smokes using foil and straw to move to this method!

Up to half of the product you burn on foil is completely wasted, you can try damage control with a good straw that you can re smoke the taken in smoke but it's just not efficient enough!

A lightbulb vaporizer will contain all of the product and all of the smoke in one chamber so that it cannot escape, less escape of smoke means you getting the best high for your hard earned money.

It takes about 20 minutes to make a pipe that you can take with you anywhere (as long as you are gentle with it!!).

The last few years I've been a chipper as far as opiates go mainly because of a lack of connections and disposable income. That's not necessarily a bad thing since the few years prior to that I had a somewhat serious dependency with OCs, blues, and xanax. 

Anyhow, I recently came into a bit of ECP. You might remember a guy posting here about a week ago how he'd gotten some and didn't care for it as a drug. Now I'm no stranger to IV as an ROA. I first used cocaine IV about 20 years ago and instantly fell in love. During that time I also had a chance to try H (IV) but was underwhelmed by it. I think it was a combination of weak dope and being so cautious with dosage and there wasn't enough to dial in a dose that worked. Several years ago I had another opportunity to try H again but this time decided to just snort it for reasons. I got really, really high. 

Since then I've wanted to try IV again but H just isn't that common in my area and I don't know anyone that does it. Most people I know are just into pills. Again, that's probably a good thing for me.

So anyway, I come into some dope and happen to already have a few rigs on hand. My tolerance is very low right now, I'd spent a month getting high on something everyday but the last I had was two blues and that was two weeks ago. Resolved to try IV but cautiously I did lots of searching through threads regarding first time made a plan. I snorted a bit to get an idea of the strength of what I had. I definitely got high so I dialed that amount back and prepped a shot. First shot definitely got me high but I wouldn't really say there was an incredible rush. The next day I dialed it up, and yep there's that rush, that's nice, but I still think there's more to experience. It's late and being still a bit high I wait until this morning to try upping the dosage again. This time, yeah, I'm right at the sweet spot I think, that's a very nice rush although I'm sure I could still go further. The rush is nice yet I can function very well at this dose once the rush drops off. 

Now I've got one more dose, still a little larger than the others and I'm debating about going ahead with it tonight as a nightcap while I chill on the sofa or save it for tomorrow when I'm fresh.

Anyhow, thanks /r/opiates the info I needed to safely IV heroin for sort of the first time.

tl;dr Got some dope, did my research gaining much insight from this subreddit, IVed heroin for the second time ever, enjoyed it and lived.

23llqp,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/23llqp/anthologies_of_an_opiate_addict/,27,https://redd.it/23llqp,SickBoySimon,Anthologies of an opiate addict.,"I come from a small conservative town of one-hundred thousand in West Texas. My story is not unlike any other. This posting will serve more as an outlet for a my internal struggle over the past 6 years.

Why don't I post in the recovery forums? Because as someone who has had a fair amount of recovery experience( 5 rehabs now). I do not seek the scripted regurgitated typical response that I would receive from a group like that.

Who am I? I'm a computer and networks engineer with capable earning capacity. I'm an online gamer. I was in to sports when I was younger. I'm the smartest idiot you will ever meet. I've become a liar and a thief. I'm a heroin addict.

Rewind 10 years. Age 16 - out of nowhere things seem really mundane. I hate high school - I hate the social stigma. I pass all of my classes without ever studying. I skip class often, but my family has known my principal for many years so I never suffer the repercussions. I've always been an abuser of systems, getting the most out any situation while exerting the least amount of effort. I research my self on line, and decide getting prescribed Adderall XR would be both fun and easy. I easily convince my doctor and parents that I need this to adequately continue my school work to advance my career in college. I love this stuff, and abuse it. It's not long before I realize that I can drop out of school, take a GED test and enter a public college of my choosing relying on a modestly high SAT score. I do this.

I enroll in college and have a blast for two semesters. I do lot's of cocaine, drinking and adderall. I begin building gaming computers for fellow classmates. I make a decent amount of money doing this. And before long, I realize that I can drop out and make great money bypassing the traditional degree and resume application pathway.

I move back to my home town and start my own business in networking services and solutions. I do well - Painkillers and heroin are not yet in the picture. I do the lesser drugs everyday, but it does not inhibit my work. I buy a 3 bedroom home. I have a new car

I meet a girl, she's beautiful - smart - and addicted to oxycontin. I don't blame her for my addiction. This is just how I was introduced. I have no idea how I missed out on the opiates earlier on in my addiction. Maybe they just were not very popular in my town at the time. Maybe I was just in to the uppers and the research did not interest me. I just didn't know what I was missing(or not missing) out on.

I loved the way it made me feel. I remember snorting that first OC 80. A soft burn at first, that in 5 minutes would give way to the most pleasurable and euphoric experience and feeling I have ever felt. This was my first nod, and It's what I have been chasing after ever since. Nothing can ever compare to the first time you do a high dose of opiod. Suddenly everything felt just fine. In that time and place, all of my worries anxieties and concern for the world melted away. Everything was just as it was before, but better and easier. Like a world full of sharp edges had suddenly given way to a more pleasing and soft, rounded perception. I was on my lunch break. I called off all work for the rest of the afternoon, and immediately went to get more.

I maintain work. Although I slowly start dipping in to my savings, and working less and less. More lying about on the couch watching some movie that I could never see all the way through. I remember I would start a movie, and then before I knew it the credits were rolling. Maybe that was a good movie? I don't know. That's the funny thing about opiates, when you are nodding you are alone by yourself. It's just you and your head. And it seems so right when it's happening. From a now sober outlook I don't know how I went so many hours with just me inside of my head, dreaming and imagining impossible circumstances. The dreams / hallucinations were always heroic in nature - maybe that is where the name Heroin was derived from. I can not recall ever having that dream where you are punching someone, and just can not hit hard enough while nodding. I could certainly do anything in these dreams.

My life slowly becomes more and more addiction-centric over the course of the next year. I am spending around 100 dollars a day on either Hydrocodone, Oxycodone, fentanyl or dilaudid. A friend of mine comes about a large quantity of heroin. I am deathly afraid of shooting up at this point. I would never be the person jam a needle in my arm, like I was above this. While he delves into the learning stages of shooting( Pushing straight through and not pulling back, the newbie stages we all go through) I snort it. It is immediately evident that heroin, black tar mexican heroin is completely bad ass. I can get my fix for half the price, and the effects are different - but welcome. It always seemed to me that heroin was more sedating than the synthetic alternatives.

Around this time, the few times I was forced to withdraw, I became very addicted to Xanax as well. Under the impression that Xanax would help with the runny nose, aching stomach and general anxiety of being without. Xanax certainly does that much. It's not long before I realize that Xanax in conjunction with heroin, is the god-tier of all drug combinations. There is something about the chemistry and interaction between the two. There is a reason that medical literature states it a dangerous, albiet extremely enjoyable combination.

Xanax has many uses. The times when you have done too much heroin, and you can not sleep. You lie awake and itch, slipping into half dream like states - Xanax will take care of this and get you ready for the following day. Xanax calms your stomach when you might feel ill. Xanax is a conduit for thievery, when you must steal and get money for your fix - Xanax will erase all anxiety of the possible repercussions you might face. When combined with the opiod agonist's(suboxone, subutex methadone etc.) it simulates a very accurate dope high. Xanax/benzodiazepines are my #2 Demon, something I feel most opiate addicts share.

Somewhere along the road I begin to realize I am losing a considerable amount of money to my addiction. My work is suffering, I can hardly bring my self to field a few hours a day. My girlfriend is a whore, and is cheating on me(booohooo). Some combination of these brings me the conclusion that shooting heroin would save me money. I bring my friend over who still has no idea how to do it. He has these monstrous allergy IntraMuscular rigs that are actually fit for horses. I was very very scared. That it might kill me. I think you have to cross that threshold before you shoot up, that you just finally do not care enough about something trivial like Life getting in the way of you feeling better. He has no idea how to do it, he plunges the large gauge needle deep into my skin, I can hear the pop of my vein as it enters. He doesn't know how to pull back. He rapidly empty's the contents of the dark thick syrupy barrel into me. It burned because he likely partially missed, but enough got in there to make me almost immediately fall out. I awake, he's poured water on me thinking I died. I feel amazing. This is the closest I have ever been to the #1. I know I did way too much now - and i was literally within a few units of death that first time. My tolerance sky rockets from here.

From this point on things get pretty bleak. I begin to work almost never, only enough to support my addiction. I tell virtually all of my clients except for the very rich and very easy ones that they will have to find a new technician. None of this seems to matter to me anymore. Being rich succesful, taking care of yourself, paying your bills on time, having a nice girlfriend, getting a dog( I gave my dog to my parents because I could not be bothered with taking care of it) mowing your grass. All of the mundane shit that does not matter when you have a true smack habit.

I begin spending upwards of 200-300 a Day on my habit. A gram or more a day and some xanax. And maybe even some crack for when I'm bored. I stop caring at all I just do everything I can to stay permanently fucked up.

At some point the dope all dries up, I can not get enough pills in me to feel well again. My arms are destroyed. My bank account is suffering greatly, I'm at almost 0. The only money I make, I spend on whatever I can to feel better. My family starts to notice that things are fucked up. They see my track marks, see my house filled with needles everywhere. Literally everwhere, I used to keep my area so clean. Not on dope. There were needles spoons beer bottles EVERYWHERE. I remember everytime I would score i would get home as fast as possible. On one occasion I locked my car with the keys in it and the ignition on. No time to bother with that. I kicked in my back door, rushed to my bathroom drew water directly from the sink, burned probably half of my dope in my spoon and injected it as quickly as possible. I laid down on my bed, put on a movie( Mad Max I think it was) and let my car empty it's tank before I woke up to the credits. The original mad max is actually a great movie sober. I watched it a few months ago. Only then, after another modest shot would I call pop-a-lock to remedy to my mistake. They would need to bring a can of gasoline while they were at it. 

Anyway, through many incidents like this my family decided that I should go to rehab. I am very hesitant at first. I can not go through the fucking withdrawals. However I learn that my local rehab center has subutex, and that none of the pains of cold-turkey withdrawal would be present. And actually when I really think about it, I would love for things to go back to my pre-opiate addiction world. It was better. I go to rehab. They load me up on 24mg of subutex a day, and 8mg of klonopin a day. I was almost as high in there as on the streets. You didn't have to do a damn thing in rehab. No work, no bills, no worries. My parents paid my bills, they only wanted me to get better. God bless my parents for going through what I put them through. Rehab wasn't half bad it turns out. Unfortunately I would use this as a backup plan for my addiction going forward. When things get bad, there's always rehab to bail you out.

I get out, I think I stay sober for a few weeks. I'm bored. I feel sorry for my self. I get back on, and it hit's with a vengeance. It really does seem you just pick up right where you left off with heroin and xanax. I am still working, some of my clients have been kind enough to keep me on after a month long ""vacation"". My income is not sufficient.

I begin stealing and scamming. I take out loans. I get credit cards. I get food stamps and sell them. I steal steaks from every grocery market in my town, and sell them at the shittiest bar in town for half price. I do returns. I fuck people over. I put on the guise that I am sober and struggling to my family for money. I fuck my best friends girlfriend. I'm really promiscious. I really do not give a fuck. I pawn my guitar, and 1980's marshall amplifier. I pawn everything but my car - I need that to get the drugs. I really push myself into financial turmoil. I never pay my bills, when they turn off my water I just use the bolt cutter on the lock. Eventually they rip out the meter. I get a gym membership on credit to avoid paying the bill. If electricity goes out, I can tap enough electricity from the phone line for a few lights and a small TV(my profession helps there). I weasel my way about life for the next couple of years, with more rehabs in between. Each and everytime swearing it off.

Eventually I get on probation for theft. How the fuck am I going to beat probation? Well, it turns out that subutex, suboxone - buprenorphine in general do not show up on standard drug tests. I get a prescription for subutex from some shady telepsychiatry doctor online. She prescribed me xanax as well - what a dear. I still can't believe there are doctors doing this - if the price is right. She did absolutely nothing but essentially ask me what it was I wanted, and it was called in to the pharmacy not an hour later.

Subutex is a great drug. I was able to get around life fairly well the next 1-2 years. Subutex eliminates any craving for opiates. I could not even imagine shooting up H while I am on it. I wish I had done this much earlier, because it was certainly a means to an end. There is still some emptyness there though. Like you don't know what you should do to make yourself feel better. It creates a void. I was still a shadow of my former self on subutex and xanax.

At some point I realize I can shoot up subutex, and it does work slightly better. My arms become probably the worst I've ever seen them.

I begin shooting up meth and smoking crack, I guess to get a rush or something I crave while on the maintenance medication. Long story short I go crazy thinking someone is going to kill me, parents call in social workers I go to the mental hospital, my probation get's revoked and I earn the privelege of spending 2 months in the county jail. 

Jail sucked. Suboxone withdrawals not as intense as Heroin, but they are longer. I get lucky enough to get on work crew, and i sweat it out. I get to smoke cigarettes on the work crew - that was great.. I guess. 

I feel great when I get out. I make the decision to rent my house out, and move to a larger city in exile. I get here, and have started working again. I have a decent client base. I really have no friends here, but that is OK for now. I've been clean for around 6 months. I do still gag sometimes in the morning, like it's still there a little bit. I started taking kratom - which seems to satisfy the craving. It's not great here, but I guess it's better than it was. I really had some great, and terrible times on Heroin. Sometimes I don't know if it's better to remember or forget.

*BONUS* One of my smack dealers had some sort of flesh eating decay virus similar to what you see with ""Krokodil"". Once I witnessed him take off his bandage. The entire tract of his arm was fresh meat exposed. The vein where he shot up was partially exposed. One of the most morbid things I've ever witnessed. He is still alive - I have no idea how. The dope must be keeping him around.

Ask me anything. I've really only just touched upon my story. I'm also finally sick of writing. Thanks

Farewell for now

Didn't use until last night. I got a job my first week here and i've been pretty good about saving money. I had a few nights in a row where i got tipped really well, and i was driving to my boys house to buy a half ounce of weed, when suddenly i see the exit i used to take to score. 
Half an hour later I had dope.

I had my puppy with me, i drove into the hood and parked where my dealer lived a year ago before i left for rehab. left everything in my car except my butterfly knife, 40$, and my puppy. Knocked on his door and someone new lived there. Started walking down the street, made it one block and i saw someone run into a house while someone was chilling in the car, and i knew it was a drug deal.

""hey man can you help me out i just moved into town.""
""sure man whatchu need?""
""Dope. H. ""
""ahhhh shit you on dat dope aintcha? all i sells powder but my boy up the street gotchu. he don't fuck with people he don't know, take my wallet and phone and i'll run in there for you if you throw me a 5.""

the dude had an iphone, and for some reason i trusted him, so I reach in my waistband for the 40$ and the shits gone.... fell on the sidewalk because i was too stupid to put it in a pocket like a normal person.
SO. i run back to my car and grab 55$ and try to forget about the 40 i had worked so hard for. I get back there and him and some other dude are getting in a car, a pretty nice honda accord for the part of town we were in.

""change of plans bruh hop in.""
i immediately jump into the back seat and he says we're going to meet the dude at a gas station, as long as i throw him 5$ for some ports.

the entire time i'm in the car i'm expecting them to tell me to hand over the cash and hop out.... but it went extremely smoothly. Pulled up at the gas station, he walks in for the ports with my 55$ and comes out with a half gram. 

I don't have any more money on me at this point for rigs and i wasn't thinking ahead because this whole thing was kind of spur of the moment, so I rip open the bag and shove it all up my nose.

I haven't snorted dope in a long time, and my first reaction after that was ""FUCK i don't have a tolerance. i think i just fucked myself""

but alas, i was greeted with nothing more than a very comfortable nod for the rest of the night. I got the guys number and he's middle manning i guess for a very reasonable price because he doesn't do dope.

 just thought i'd share a successful cold copping experience! it went about as well as it could have, there aren't dboys on corners in this part of town.",1398260251.0

the boy took my heavier bag in one hand, and held my hand with the other, leading me to a diner for a delicious meal, me trying to hide my shame and him expressing his belief in me. after this, and after spending some time at his apartment, it was time. he again took my hand, leading me to the train and taking me to the hospital ER entrance where i was told to report for the start of my 72 hour inpatient medical detox from heroin.

he was clearly tired from work and i appreciated his encouragement so i told him to go home, get some sleep, again hesitantly kissing him goodbye. after some paperwork, i was led to the ER for some urine and blood tests and to wait for the detox unit to prepare for my arrival. 

for months, i had avoided treatment because i knew, inevitably, they would have to take blood and i was so ashamed and afraid of the judgment i would incur from my extensive track marks. they were pretty unprofessional taking my blood, acting like i didn't have a vascular system, finally taking it from an artery. i hit myself without TOO much trouble every day, and their judgmental attitudes, looks and words hammered this in like nails in my coffin. but i had to stay strong, no bitch nurse was stopping me from getting help. you can say it was the two nurses' problems, but it hurt to be judged at a moment when i needed support more than ever. 

early the next morning, like 5am early, i was finally accepted into the detox unit. i won't go on about this too much but the staff was obviously much more accepting, although i got a lot of, ""you're young with a gorgeous face, why did you do that to your body?"". as if i had superpowers...

most of the people in the detox unit were in their 40s, african american, many health problems from years of abusing themselves, and many had been in detoxes 10+ times. i had some great conversations with some of these people, but i don't want to end up being ""THAT girl."" most were snorters.

after receiving the news that i was in perfect health according to the tests, i was especially grateful. best of all, they slowly detoxed me using decreasing doses of methadone, along with tramzene to help with the stir-craziness and insomnia. i actually slept, no real sweats, no shits, no restless legs. i even could have eaten a bit if the hospital food hadn't been god-awful. 

i was released saturday morning at 7:30AM, along with some scripts for 14 xanax bars and clonidine (the latter i wanted for obvious ""just in case"" reasons). 

last, though my grandma pays for my insurance and i have an 80/20, $250 deductible, approx. $230 monthly premium with blue cross blue shield, i have no income of my own. the hospital found a methadone program with me that you pay according to a sliding scale. i need a letter from social security or public aid attesting to my lack of any income, but i am now receiving free methadone. (if i get a job, which i plan to as soon as i am a bit more stable, i will have to pay, but according to my income versus expenses, etc). fucking THANK GOD. 

i started the program yesterday at 20mg. you can ask for 10mg increases a day. 20mg is not holding me so i have been using small amounts of heroin, unfortunately, but i can already see and feel the changes in myself, and perhaps more importantly i see that i want good things for myself finally. i had orientation today and missed the hours when i could see someone to adjust my dose, but i am trying to stay at a dose that is as small as possible. i also have to attend a few group meetings, individual counseling sessions a month, as well as (i believe) one drop a month. 

i really felt there was no hope. i tried so many times to kick on my own and i failed every time. i tried to find an affordable or merely available sub doctor and could not succeed in finding that either. my frustration was at an all time high. the tipping point was that i can't enter into this romantic relationship in a serious way unless i'm clean because he's not having that shit, but i don't want a shitty life either, whether or not that works out (though i hope and pray it does).

remember you are not alone and though i continue to struggle, every day i grow stronger and more stable, and i am even optimistic about my future--i believe now that there IS a future for me. 

sorry that was long but i wanted to share my experiences just for some moral support and possibly to give someone else hope! 

i had none before trying detox, and i thank God for sending me such a beautiful man to literally hold my hand and take me away from a place of such profound pain.",1398216575.0

A FUCKING CIGARETTE CELLOPHANE PACKAGE WITH 20 ROXY 30'S!!!!! I was like holy fuck, holy fuck; no fucking way this just happened. I was literally shaking because I was so happy. So I walk out of the bathroom, go and buy a fountain soda, basically humming to myself in complete bliss....

Like, ""Went to this sweet concert on some fire dope!"" Or ""Went on a road trip with some oxys!"" ... Other activities or interests being performed in accompaniment with opiates is funny to me. It's like, we shoot dope and then pretend like we are normal by going to the movies, playing sports, etc. I use to have a lot of interests too. I used to do a lot of things. But slowly but surely all those things got replaced with heroin. 

I see a lot of this from new opiates users on here. They think that they will uphold their current lifestyle and hobbies forever. Sooner or later it inevitably happens. All those things get replaced with opiates. It's only a matter of time. 

I had a dealer tell me once, ""This guy who comes to me everyday was begging me for something and he said he would pay me back. He told me he went to see a movie the other night and he is now kicking himself because he spent 20 bucks that he could have used to buy drugs with now. Why did he do that to himself? Why is he even pretending like he is normal? Like he goes to the movies and shit like a normal person and stuff. That's laughable. You are a heroin addict. Don't act like you have money or time for other things.""

I thought that was fucked up hearing that at the time. But as time went on, and I experienced opiate addiction for myself, I realized how goddamn true that was. I wouldn't dare waste money on ""normal"" things because that would just detract from the money for dope. I can't do normal things anymore. So I don't. I don't even pretend like I am normal...

**Things to consider**

If you pick the low tolerance option, it would be extremely easy to OD. You most likely have to always use with another person around and have narcan on hand. You'll puke and get nauseous on a tiny amount of dope. You probably wont be able to IV safely. The pro is that your habit would be very low and your drugs won't cost as much. Every dose will get you an instant nod and euphoria that lasts for several hours.

If you pick the OD proof choice then no matter what crazy combination you do, you'll never OD. You can take as much dope as you want, without getting nauseous and you'll be able to nod and feel great even after your tolerance is sky high. You can use alone without the worry of falling out. But you will have to spend A LOT of money just to get high. It will take a 1+ grams just to get a buzz.  ",1398313826.0

Any help would be greatly appreciated.","First and foremost, I went to drink my tea this morning (made the night before) and it had a taste equivalent to the PST version of sour milk. I'll note that it was not refrigerated, but my house is kept rather cool and I have never had this issue before. I usually make my tea a day before and drink it the next day (daily routine). It was sour and made me gag...yet of course I drank it all. Painfully. I'm waiting to see if it has any effects. If for some reason the plant matter left over in the water went sour, I don't think that should have an effect on it's potency right? When I taste tested it last night it was good and bitter as usual. Has anyone tasted ""sour"" tea before? Any idea what caused it?

Ok next point. I'm starting to plateau in effects. I use Bob's Red Mill seeds and I have noticed the strength slowly waning, I chalk it up to tolerance as to be expected. I normally take 2 pound doses. Yesterday I made a 4 pound batch to see if I could reclaim some of the effects with a higher dosage. No such luck, it affected me no differently then the 2 pound dose. Any recommendations? 


Lastly I have a question about quitting. It's crossed my mind. Especially if the effects are beginning to dissipate and I can't up my dose effectively. When I take tea now I get a very very very subtle mood elevation. That's it. I'm a little happier, a little more social. I think most of feelings of positivitey come from the knowledge that I won't be withdrawing. Which leads me to my next question. If I am not feeling anything from the tea when I take it, if I stopped would the withdrawal be bad? I used to be a heroin addict and when I would binge and run out, withdrawal was atrocious. At the same time when I was a heroin addict I was getting obliterated in terms of highness, multiple times a day. So does the amount of high you feel correlate to the withdrawal pains?",1398441508.0

Then I start thinking, what all positives do different opioid users get out of their addictions? Besides the obvious, being high as shit, there are other reasons and good things that have come from my using. First of all, it destroys my anxiety that I have been plagued with wince I was a child. It also makes me able to be more social and actually meet people. If I am not high, I won't ever walk up to a new person at work, party, etc and introduce myself. I dunno why I just was never really trained in social skills like that for some reason :( . But when high, I will just waltz over there and WANT to introduce myself.

I already did the dope. I'm just trying to roughly gauge the quality of the dope but I do realize it's not exact, everyone is different etc. Dope is fairly rare in my immediate area so my experience is limited but I thought it might be at least average if not pretty good. I do have plenty of experience with the 30 mg blues.

This stuff came as stamps sourced from a darknet market. I've not used those markets before and didn't make the order but have since looked at the vendor's listing. The vendor describes it as being from a NYC mill with the stamp weights ranging from .07-.09g. The bag I started with to get a baseline for potency was on the smaller side of the three bags. It had been 3 weeks since using anything besides a couple of doses of tea so my tolerance was low but not zero. So I snorted roughly 1/3 of the bag to try and get a baseline for what I wanted to shoot and that 1/3 gave me a buzz that I would say was pretty much in line with what I would get from a blue. With that, 1 bag more or less equals 3 blues. It dissolved quite readily in room temp water leaving almost no residue in the spoon, basically just put the water in, have a smoke, stir a little and suck it up.

Does this sound right? Does it sound like average, good, better than good dope?

23xge0,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/23xge0/mindset_of_drug_usage/,12,https://redd.it/23xge0,coconut_dude,Mindset of drug usage.,"Hey, I just got joined to reddit yesterday and the reason was that I could share my thoughts.

I got just inspired by this thread ''Tweakers vs Junkies''.

So here we go!

So I have been using drugs for quite long time in my life, started with drinking alcohol and smoking cigarrets at age of 13 and year later started trying pot. We did drink with my buddies once a week or once a month first, but at age of 17 I did some bad moves while drunk and got into bad fight and it had some minor consequences, but I got beaten physically quite bad, just looked like a racoon for few weeks and had sore places. But next day I saw a friend and he had some nice nugs and he rolled a joint, this was almost very first bud that I ever did, normaly we had only hash, it was so strong and got me so high and at the moment I realized that damn the way I have been using alcohol is so ill way. That was the moment that I did decicion to back of from alchohol and just keep smoking pot, one of the best decicions at that age.

So from that point I got into reading everything about drugs, mostly about psychedelics and when I had first change to take some HWBR(contains 'LSA') seeds and I got this deep joy when it took me to the trip and I was sold to that, eversince I have enjoyed mostly all 'mainstream' psychedelics and if shamans say that plants can teach you, they sure did show me a way of looking my own actions in very different way.

Just lately I have got into opiates, I did told at age of 17 that I never will do chemicals, but here I am doing heroin once in awhile. But I learned the way to recpect the drugs, all of them, I'm trying to see them as they are, not how 'society' paints them, but how they really are, taking care of the knowledge about the physical and mental harm they can cause and this has made me to realize that we can use most of the drugs if we wish with quite safe ways. 

So it's about the mindset we have when we use them. Most problems that people have from drugs is just question of the right knowledge and proper usage of the knowledge. So I enjoy drugs a lot, but I want to get most of it as well, the whole range of the effects and honestly best way of achieving that is not to build tolerance to the drug, the magic is gone if we try to abuse them, it's fine line there, like the famous golden middleway. 

If a person is taking drugs with wrong feeling(mindset), it sure start to cause problems and this is where the biggest problem with drugs is. Most of the cases when person gets addicted and destroys him self with drugs is cause the wrong reason to do them, not the the effects that the drugs causes. But if person has healthy values in their 'heart' they can do even heroin once in awhile with minimal risk. 

The reason I want to write this is that old and new users would find that psychological hole that they are going to use or are using a drugs. When that is clear, drugs are so much safer and actually it might make some old users to kick the habit to the enjoyable level. If you are serious about drugs, serious user of drugs, then you should find that serious respect for them too and take most out of them by not taking them every day or every week even, I guarantee that you guys enjoy it much much better than daily usage.

Don't lose that gloria on drugs!!!

I just did snort some nice heroin and it's first time in a month that I did it and just 20mg in four different lines got me so so nice and the legs are so much longer than for daily usage.

Last thursday, a bud of mine brought me some subs and I took half of a strip. I had never done opiates before and he told me it was like a pill high so I didn't worry. Fast forward to about 3 hours later. I'm passing out for seconds at a time, nasueas as hell, closing my eyes and hallucinating as if they were still open (is this normal?), and throwing up all over my trashcan. Didn't eat the next day due to how terrible I felt. Anyways, I have a question. If I took half of a strip and maybe 1\6 of a strip a few days later will I have a tolerance build up so that i can take a little bit more and not wind up over my trash can again? I'd like to do suboxones every now and then as opiates are really hard to get around here and want to be sure I can get a good dosage without regretting it the next day. As for how many mg the strip was, I honestly have no clue. I should've found out and researched first. Thanks!",1398398286.0

Will there always be the empty void feeling inside of me that only heroin can fill? 


It reminds me of a scene from the movie Owning Mahowny with Philip Seymour Hoffman whose character    
has a life-debilitating gambling addiction and is speaking to a Psychologist:

*Psychologist: How would you rate the thrill you got from gambling, on a scale of one to 100?*

*Dan Mahowny: Um... hundred.*

*Psychologist: And what about the biggest thrill you've ever had outside of gambling?*

*Dan Mahowny: Twenty.*

Mahowny then realizes he must accept and be content with living the rest of his life at a ""twenty"" if he wants    
to survive. 

Heroin gives me a ~~thrill~~ feeling of 100. I cannot imagine living life at a 20...with an empty void forever. Just thinking about it makes me so depressed. I know heroin is slowly (maybe quickly) killing me, but I also know that I cannot live for long feeling empty everyday. Yes, hiking, love, sunshine, puppies, vitamins, etc can help fill the empty spot, but will it ever be 100% filled or even filled up enough that I feel satisfied and content?

So when I got home from school today and looked again at how much H is in my sink, I went and got a 3/4 length Wendy's straw and started snorting that shit up my nose.

I've read that oxy's bioavailability is higher when taken orally as opposed to intranasally. As far as I know that's a pretty widely accepted fact. So why do people snort them? Is this just because of DAT RUSH or do people just like to snort things? Is there another reason I'm overlooking?

The reason I ask is that I may find myself coming into some in the future, and I want to make the most of it, so I was wondering how you folks feel on this topic.

How do you take your oxy and why?

Its  usually 70 pills and it doesnt last me but maybe a week most times. This last script lasted from a wednesday to me taking my last half of a pill the following monday morning. I then had to wait till today to get my script filled (normally its on wednesdays but they were out, so I just picked up). So thats 9-10 days with no opiates.

So I loaded up two pills so 8mg, which I always do for my first shot when I pick up my new script. Now i have been taking D for 6 months this time, and have been on and off for the past 7 years, so Im tolerent to it. I usually shoot and then sprint from the bathroom to the couch to try to saver as much of the ""rush"" while in a comfy laying down position. It usually lasts a minute or two, then that warm lovely feeling. However this I timed it after a while and it lasted 23 minutes. Holy hell did that feel good, best shot I have ever taken.

So the pills are the same brand, I prepared them the same way I always do. So what the fuck happened? so I can do it again haha. The only thing i can think of is I have recently been put on prescription antiacids and then something called Librax. from what I read Librax is an anti spasmatic (for the colon) and a mild benzo (its actually the first benzo ever created). From what I have read its not that strong, so im wondering how it possibly could have made such a difference? I know mixing benzo's and ops is a bad combo if your not being safe, but its not like I slammed 5mg of xanax and shot up. This stuff is like 1/5th the strength of xanax so wtf gives....

Whatever it was I shall remember it fondly haha, I hope everyone is having a great thursday, is safe, and nodding away ;p much love

I began my journey into the world of drugs at 19. It was pretty much marijuana, MDMA and psychedelics but I always knew I would fall in with opiates. I hung out with the pro-drug crowd in college and we spent countless weekends at the dorms dabbling.

My first opiate tried was probably a prescribed vicodin or percoset...taken as prescribed and not for recreational use. My first real recreational dabble with opiates was snorting small shavings off of an Opana...boy was I in love.

Fast forward two years and I naturally progressed like many. Percs and vics then blues. Im from the northeast and around 2011/12, blues jumped from 50cents a mg to $1 a mg. I couldn't afford to continue dabbling with my tolerance and serious pot habit so I began enjoying the cost friendly benzos. Benzos turned me into a blackout shell of who I used to be so I seriously cut down.

Then november of 2013  I finally snorted ECP....and my first words to a fellow opiate user was: ""fuck spending a small fourtune on a 10pack of blues...dope is the shit!""

It took me four months before I felt withdrawls symptoms which is the main reason i use. Fuck withdrawls. Back in the day, the availbility of blues and percs were scarce so I rarely went a week straight using. However in nyc, dope is plentiful.

Fast forward to today and I am happy because for the first time in a long time, I woke up sick (per usual...with no get well but funds) rolled over and grabbed my phone, called my dealer and he was right around the corner from me. One of the rare times I got dope in less than 5mins. Usually its 15-30mins.

So, here I am: 24, an addict, aspiring writer with funds that can't match my habit. Hello!",1398356792.0

Anyone else wanna share in my happiness? (Long),"So all week, I've been at this customer's house for a rather large job. The salesman bidded it for 3 days, but after the bossman came out to take a look (because the work is out of the ordinary for once), he let the customer know we weren't going to be able to finish til Friday.

So on Wednesday, the douchebag (guy got pissed because he wanted extra work done that wasn't on the work order and we told him no), said we weren't allowed to come on Thursday because he had an appointment. Fair enough. I needed a day away from him. We finish the day up with only 3 things left to do on the work order. Two were very detailed and time consuming while the other was fairly simple.

Thursday comes and while I'm headed to a different customer's house to drop off some materials,  I decided to look up the weather for the job site on Friday. Rain. FUCK! Rain is a big problem for what I do. After the foreman, myself, and other worker get together, we decide to leave earlier on Friday morning to get a jump on the weather.

Friday. We get there nice and early, sunny skies so far. Weatherman says rain is gonna hit around 3pm.  There's only one thing that needed to be done to the outside of the house and rain would ruin our day. We decide to do that first. Everything gets set up and we immediately get to work. We make AWESOME time and bang it out quicker than usual.  My foreman/buddy is inside doing the minimal work while I'm manning the machine.

Fast forward to about 1pm. It's my time to shine. I get to doing my part of the work and surprisingly it only took me 3 hrs (should've taken about 4 - 4 1/2). I did it properly and when I finished, stepped back and looked, I was actually really impressed with my work and proud of myself which doesn't happen too often.

As we're loading up our equipment into the trailer, the rain begins. Paperwork was signed and we go into full speed mode. We load it all up, hop in the work truck and no sooner do we shut the door, the downpour comes.  We all look at each other and start yelling like we won the Super Bowl. We had a great day! That rarely happens.

As we're making the hr trip back to the shop to drop off the trailer, I hit my boy up. ""Good?"" ""Yup."" ""Be home in hr n a half, cool to come through? "" ""Yea.""

Head down, grab 10 smurfs, popped 3. My team won last night. Nodded reeeeal nice.

Woke up this morning in a good mood, because I realized we finished yesterday and don't have to go back today, I have 6 smurfs left, and I don't plan doing a fucking thing all day except get high because I worked my ASS OFF this week and I deserve it.

Thanks everyone for the feedbacks. After thinking about this for a bit and reading the CDC article on hep c, i decided to flush the batch down the toilet and a take a break from copping on the streets.

He always has product, always gives an honest quality assessment... you get the picture. I've dealt with either him or his family for years.

He sometimes runs out and has a few days down, waiting to re up, but he's definitely the most reliable source I have.

So the other night I get a text from him asking if I have any Subs I can spare- he is out and ""has to go to work tomorrow."" Whaaaaaaaaa?? I mean WTF?!?
I tell him sure, come on thru. Holy shit the shoe is on the other foot. This is the LAST person I ever, ever thought would touch dope. He came by and was very gracious and grateful... But damn! I'm still speechless.

Alright, so my buddy has been having me front him 30s for the most part of the month seeing as he had fallen on hard times. He would usually get me back within a few days or so. However, at the end of the month he was super addicted to oxy, like way more than he was even before. I think this had something to do with me fronting him them (obviously), although I believe he would have gotten pills either way. But mainly I think the exponential growth in his addiction was down to him going through a rough patch with his girl. His roommates and myself (we all successfully chip, once a week maximum now) sat him down today and had a talk with him about how we want him to chip with us or at least cut down a bit, seeing as bills aren't getting paid and he is in debt to all of us, and we don't want him to end up on the streets.
   So basically, his response was good, he wants to cut back and even quit in the near future. I told him I'd help him out with weening off through WDs and that I got his back.
   So about 5-6 hours later and he texts me, ""yo man I'm really hurting could you front me 2 blues, please dude as your friend just do me this one favor. I wanna ween off by taking a half today, half tomorrow and 7.5mg the next two days"" so I say ""yeah sure I'll tell ya what I'll give you 15 today, 15 tomorrow, and 7.5 as needed."" And he refuses! So as he suffers through WD I offer to buy him a quit kit (lope, immodium, fiber bars, kpins, xanax, weed, stool softener, etc.) He refuses again.
  
 Should I just let him suffer and then relapse and end up on the street. Sorry for the long post I really just don't want to see my best friend throw his life and opportunities away, and I figured you guys could offer some advice, whether it be that I'm doing everything wrong and that I'm a dick or what I need to do to help him, any input is welcome.

I'm thinking that I might try subs again. When I was on them before I felt generally happier - like life was just a tiny little bit easier and more enjoyable. Having dealt with clinical depression since I was a kid it was a nice feeling for me. 

I know people might say ""yeah the docs aren't gonna let you stay on subs forever, but the program I went through before seemed perfectly happy to do just that.

She loves me unconditionally regardless of how much I fuck up (which is all the time) and I love her more and more each day because of it. She is an amazing  gorgeous woman who is really spiritual (she use to be a pastor of a Pentecostal church) and knows more scripture and the essence of it all than anyone I have ever met. I have every intention on marrying this girl one day.  She is a good girl in the most literal sense. She doesn't drink, doesn't inhale smoke of any kind, and even has issues taking Advil beyond absolute necessity. Don't ask how I got her because I honestly couldn't tell you. The problem is me... well, my addiction and my choice to stay addicted anyway.

when she met me 2 years ago, she knew I had a small problem with oxy. She didn't care. i was able to maintain my habit without it interfering with our lives too much. Jump a year later and we start becoming pretty serious, then we start fighting, she leaves for a month, I start smoking dope. About a month later she calls me saying she is pregnant with my son. Great. we're back together of course, but my habit has escalated to a problem, and not surprisingly she's growing pretty tired of her not being top priority in my life. She still doesn't look at me as a junkie even though I''ve done enough petty deeds for my fix to deserve the label. But yet, here she still is, lying in bed, 6 months pregnant with my first child, while I sit in the bathroom, smoking a dub and writing this post. 

I guess the point of all this and my question is, I'm sure a lot of you have a significant other who loves you as much as mine does me, but how do you maintain the relationship while still partying on a daily? Are your lovers still patient and understanding and if so how do you reciprocate that while spending a large portion of time waiting for dude to arrive? 

For those who have loved and lost, first I'm very sorry for that and I am in no way trying to open up old wounds, but if you'll allow me, how long did your SO hang on for and what was the final straw that brought it all down? I ask only in hopes of avoiding the same mistake and losing the best thing to ever walk into my life. 

Appreciate anyone who took the time to read this and I appreciate any advice or insight you may have for me and anyone who may be in a similar position.

I hate that i've gotten to this point but i'm seeing things differently now. I could have died. Now that i'm still alive - there are some things I need o take care of.

This is your standard ""I'm pretty opiate naive, how much should I take?"" kind of post.  I'm no stranger to most drugs, and fairly good friends with many of them, but I've never been much of an opiates user.  Some morphine here, percs and oxy there, but never any consistent use (we're talking perhaps once a year) and always in a certain amount of moderation because someone somewhere put the scare in me that ODs are a real thing.

Anywho, I find myself with a 75 mcg/hr fent patch, and I'd like to give it a shot.  My lurking has suggested that gumming it might be the way to go, so I suppose the question is, how much and what exactly should my process be?  I know smoking is a decent alternative, but I have no clue how to go about doing that.  Any advice would be helpful, and, of course, taken with a grain of salt and the knowledge that this stuff is reputedly a bit strong.  Cheers, and thanks.

** Edit **

Update:  Gave gumming a shot, starting with a miniscule piece (about 1/20 of the patch).  Pleasant; nothing too strong.  Next day, moved up to a piece about twice the size.

Thank you to everyone for the advice and especially for the concern.  I remain alive, and will continue to use cautiously small pieces of this patch.  I think I'll hang it up when this one is done.

I've been lurking here for a while, occasional poster and first off I wanted to say hello and to thank you all for being so informative and a generally cool bunch of folks.
I'm an occasional (around once every 3 weeks) H user and fairly regular (maybe once a week) codeine guy and I've been doing various opiates on and off for about 8 years or so, basically since I was 16 and finding this subreddit has really been comforting and kinda helped keep me out of trouble etc. You all seem like nice and helpful people who look out for each other so I hope you could set my mind at ease about something.

So my mum has been on Co-Codamol now for about 10 years. Here in the UK it is pretty much all that gets prescribed as far as opiates and strong painkillers go (occasionally she got tramadol but it messed her up so they always switched her back) and she's been prescribed 100  30/500 mg tablets every few weeks and gets through them fairly quickly.

Since her marriage fell apart and she fell into a pretty bad depression (although admittedly no-where NEAR as rough as it was when me and my little brother were kids) she's started slowly taking more so she's been running out before she can get her prescription filled again and she's been getting withdrawal symptoms (awful diarrhea, migraines, shakes etc).

Anyway by chance she saw a different doctor a few weeks ago other than her usual one and this new woman took a look at her record and went mental. Apparently she was only supposed to have been prescribed them for a few months originally but her regular doctor was just re-upping her everytime she came in and not telling her about the risks or anything. (There were some other problems too and her doctor has been suspended for it).

Her current doctor has told her that if she carries on at the rate she is going she will likely be dead by the time she is 50 (my mum is 44) because her liver is an absolute disaster on account of all the paracetamol.

Because of this she's going to get sent to a 2 week in-patient rehab clinic thing as soon as a spot opens up.

**TL;DR/The Point:**So I guess my question is this: Do any of you have experience with this kind of facility/whatever? She used to drink quite a bit in her 30s and she's had serious depression issues all her life but she's never had to be in any kind of institution like this or done proper hard drugs or anything. Aside from once headbutting a cop when she was drunk about 6 years ago she has never been in any legal trouble or anything and although we're pretty poor (lives in a council house, single mum all her life apart from 5 years of marriage etc) where we're from isn't particularly rough or anything so I am kinda worried about how she's going to cope with being there.

What are these places like? I mostly ask just for peace of mind really.

This is probably a stupid question, but I'd like some advice.
Today I got some T1s and did a CWE. I used 15 pills, which would be 120mg. I undoubtedly lost some in the process, meaning it was closer to 100mg, probably. I took some DMH beforehand (100mg = 50mg DPH), just for the anti-histamine effect. After around 45 minutes, I started to feel a little bit of a come up, not much more than anticipation. After that, I really didn't feel much different at all. 
Was I expecting too much out of 100mg? I've heard of people nodding on that much so I wanted to play it safe for my first time. Or did I just fuck up my CWE? I followed the steps exactly but perhaps the water wasn't quite cold enough. I really doubt it though. If it helps, I've had a high natural tolerance to DXM and LSD, even my first times with those substances. 
I'm extremely disappointed, as this was supposed to be my reward for studying hard and remaining clean from weed and all other drugs (including caffeine and alcohol!) for almost a month while studying for finals. I was really looking forward to it.
Would it be safe for me to try again with a higher dosage tomorrow night? I was planning on leaving at least two weeks between trips in order to avoid physical addiction and withdrawal symptoms, but I really want to make my first time with opiates something special. When I mean safe, I'm really asking whether my tolerance will be significantly higher from doing it the day before, as well as if there is any strong addiction potential in doing it two days in a row. Of course, after this I would wait the two weeks before doing it again.

I saw people saying that it just combusts before it can evaporate and just handful of people said that just smoke it ti should work. I played with the idea in my head for awhile and then like always, it's just the best way to know if it's possible to try it by myself. 

So I did just took a small candle and piece of foil, burt the foil first to get all that shit that it's covered to burn away, not sure if there is any, but i sure smokes for few seconds always. So I figured out that best way of controlling the heat is to have a candel and fold that foil in two, so it's thicker. 

Then I just add some #4 there, just a little bump and gave it a try and it sure did not combust at all, it melted first to this clear liquid and then it started to evaporate till it turned brown and then I hold that vapor in my lungs for ten seconds or so and had another toke, same thing happened, that brown stuff bubbled there till it just got blackish and harder and after that it was done. It tasted nice too, I gotta say it's quite nice tastin stuff to be an chemical :P

So now I am high from that. Such a nice change for snorting it too. Only thing that is left behind is most likely that HCL salt and all that heroin is evaporating away. Same thing happens when you smoke DMT fumarate vs. DMT freebase, you have this little solid stuff left behind. What might be one reason that some people think that base heroin is working better, but remember guys that #4 heroin is diacetylmorphine + HCL, so it's heavier than base to start with or in other words you need more HCL than base if you measure them, but that really does not matter on street drugs, they are pretty dirty to start with.

Oh, and if some smartass is going to blame that it was base, no it wasn't, i tested it with water and it's water soluable. 

So there you go guys, it's possible and I am sure that it won't was a thing if you do it with care and respect. I like that this opened new way of taking it for me, I have only been able to snort it, IV is out of the question for the quality reasons, would do it with pharma grade, but street stuff oh man, but hey everyone has their on ways!

So, if you've encountered me in my other posts you'll know that I'm mostly a chipper, and I've been doing opiates for about a decade. So I mostly know my shit, except I'm not familiar with WD. Go me, right? Well, I went on a PST binge recently and when I stopped I went into what are definitely WD's--body pain, fatigue, inability to pay attention to anything, the shits, nausea, etc. that's alleviated by nothing except another dose of opiates.

I tried to do a taper to get myself off this--I would do cold turkey but I have to work two jobs, and that's just not going to happen. I dropped my dose by 1/2 every two days--so, a pretty slow taper I guess--and had symptoms that weren't that bad, if any. I went from ~2 lbs. to 1/4 lb. (so, the doses were 2 lbs, 1 lb, 1/2 lb, etc.) At the 1/4 lb. mark I wasn't feeling anything and figured I could drop to zero without a problem--I just dropped 1/4 lb. from 1/2 lb. a day before without an issue, right?

For some reason, my body is spazzing out at the sign of NO opiates, even though, as far as I can tell, I just jumped from a very small amount to nothing. My WD's have come back full force for like two days and aren't letting up. It feels like how they were when I tried to do cold turkey at the 1 lb mark. Wtf gives? How long is this supposed to go on?

I don't want to use anything, but I don't know how else I'm supposed to function for the next few days. Argh! I know this is a terrible question, but how exactly does it affect your WD's if you take a dose in the middle of doing cold turkey? Does it send you back to square 1, or what?

Anything you guys can tell me about this process helps...I know kind of generally from this site things that help (lope, etc.) but I can't find a lot of information about timelines, especially for PST, or information about how dosing in the middle of WD affects things. 

Thanks guys.",1398533616.0

Way back when I was little

Back when I was younger

I never looked into the future and conceptualized that I would be the one that got pulled under.  

I don't care what you say
""It won't happen to me.""

By the time I graduated high school
The pills were already in control of me

Slowly, but surely, the light would die

The time when I was supposed to grow up, slowly slipped by

""Make a name for yourself, the world is yours""

That only rang a bell when through my sunken veins the drugs would course

And of course

I gotta get myself back on course

But it's like I'm screaming out for help with a voice way too hoarse

My soul is empty, but my heart and mind keep racing
Calling everyone I know, mentally pacing

""Man someone pick up, I know my fix is out there!""

Guess I'm outta luck, fuck it, guess I'm gonna die here

Not really die, but you know what I'm sayin'

This isn't my first time in the game 
That all us addicts are used to playin'

Shit, piss, fuck, only an hour has passed
Lord I'm only 19 but I feel like I'm down on my last

Sweaty, stressed, and strapped to a cocked catapult
I'm barely an adult, but this is only MY fault

I wish I had the type of family that I could call for help

But what can I say? History does repeat itself
Dad drank himself to death

At at only 7 years old, I watched and witnessed it myself

That might have been my motive, or maybe my genetic reason

That I ended up so deep that without the meds, my brain is screamin' treason!

I've tried to talk to my friends, but they don't understand. 

They look me in the eyes, 
""come on, cheer up, it's all mental man."" 

So I guess after all, it's just me, myself, and I 

My only complaint. 
Only? Fuck, who do I think I'm kidding?
If I could go back, I'd start clean without a single beat askippin'




Don't touch those first pills boy, 
that's my only advice

Before you even know it, they'll have your balls in a vice

Then after that you'll do some dangerous gamblin'
Grab your pair of dice

Next, comes the chains. 
Strap you down

""You're walking out on me? Yeah good luck with that.""
That's hilarious, you should be a clown

The doctors your controller now, and he knows that you'll be back

It doesn't matter your method, 
I know It's gonna be a crazy ride, and now you wanna turn back? 

Justify your self son, as you shoot up that sweet smack

Feels good doesn't? 
You say the rush is amazing

You're almost a member son, just a little more hazing
Just a little more I promise, it'll be crazy

The day finally came, you're a member now!
""So what do I do now?""


Next you hear a voice, ""what do you do now? Just relax son, you'll be coming with me now

""No! No! You'll scream! It's not my time!""
""I'm only 19! This can't be it. 


Then you really feel it. Damn that some super strong shit. 
Then your breath  begins to slow, 
The beating of that heart, that'll be next to go

You hear the voice again
Death himself is speaking to you now
""No bargaining for a junkie. Come on it's time to go""

""My time has finally come."" 
You lock your eyes with death 

19 years old
You never imagined that smack would claim you last breath



Way back when you were little

Yeah back when you were younger 

You never did understand how fate could drag you under

But in that very instant everything seemed so clear
Every pill or shot you ever took, 
lead your life right here
You think back on the final moments 
But there's nothing you can do
Your mind wonders back to 10th grade, when those Percs were handed to you
You never even had to eat them
Your body on the floor in front of you
Then death ask, ""now do you understand what they can lead to?""
You nod in stern agreement 
""Now I do.""

We both have close to no tolerance (5 or 6 previous opiate experiences) and both had the same amount. I was in a really good place, but this is what happened to her: 

 - Suddenly extremely tired
 - Couldn't keep eyes open, just wanted to sleep
 - Slurred words
 - When asleep would start making weird screeching sort of sound
 - Heart rate stayed pretty much normal
 - Breathing fairly constant and controlled, but definitely not 100% normal.

Kept waking her up since I was worried, she'd wake up after about 5 seconds of jolting her, then back asleep within a minute even whilst actively talking to her

She then started doing this whilst sleeping: 

 - Started breathing really heavily
 - Having REALLY heavy spasms/twitching, like whole body would jolt every 5 seconds or so
 - However heart rate stayed normal

I continued to wake her up every time she fell asleep (These symptoms only occurred when she was asleep, when she was awake she'd simply be slurring words and be really dazed) and continued to for the next 3 hours. 

I kept asking her if she wanted me to call an ambulance, but she refused as we were at her parents house and she couldn't let them find out. I also offered to drive her to hospital but she refused that too due to parents. 

She ended up being fine but I'm still slightly traumatised, I'm new to opiates, so I wasn't too sure if this was simply her having a good time nodding out or this was an OD. I feel bad that if it was an OD I should have ignored her and called an ambulance.

I know it varies from brand to brand, but let's assume 1lb of high quality is used and the seeds are washed about 3 times with a liquid containing citric acid before being discarded. How much morphine would most likely be in the resulting tea? I would guess somewhere between 70mg-140mg, but that's only based on assumptions I've heard before.

I have alot of adderal and vyvanse on hand. Also about half a bottle of new amsterdam vodka. I may be able to fill my lorazepam before then too. I hope i can because i know they will help alot. 

How do you think i should go about this detox? I need it to be the least painfull as it can possibly be. i have work the first 3 days i have to start. Sucks wish i could lay in bed but i have to start tuesday. :(. 

Im ready to be clean though im sick of living like this. Being sick. Hurting people i love. Selling my shit. I barely get high anymore and when i do its spending $40+ in one shot! And the high isnt even like it used to be. i love the way it used to feel when i used to eat vikes and shit like that and snorting here or there  and when i first started shooting. Being itchy and sweating and nodding off, so much euphoria. Now its not like that at all. Its just getting not sick and a little baby buzz. It feels like if i ate 5mg of hydro from when i had no tolerance. even when i shoot a half a bundle. I realize i went a little in depth and off topic here. Sorry tweakin balls did some shards earlier. 


So im thinking ill do it like this. But if i feel like i can handle it add adderal as needed for work and ill be able to pick the dose as needed. (Also i might add ive been taking adderal and vyvanse for 3 years now and i have a big tolerance and it gives me no euphoria at all)


Day 1 8mg suboxone 
Day 2 4mg of suboxone
Day 3 4mg of suboxone
Day 4 4mg of suboxone
Day 5 4mg of suboxone 
Day 6 and on, 20mg of loperamide as needed. (Oh yeah i also have 150 or so 2mg pills. Idk about takin them though because the last time i took them after using for a month straight i had the most painful shit of my life.. it was the first time i used everyday, so my wd's werent too bad. )

Do you think i will be able to get through feelin like doggy dick and be able not feel alot of wd? What would *you* do if you were in my situation? how would you change my schedule. Any feed back is largely appreciated.

I am a student learning computer programming and for the next couple of weeks we have to work on a personal project (web application) which we will show to potential employers upon graduation. I have many friends who struggle with opiate addiction, and have many friends who have passed away due to their addiction. I was wondering if you guys think a harm-reduction web app would be beneficial/useful. Ideally, there would be some sort of buddy/follower system, allowing users to keep tabs on eachother. I would like to pull in location info for needle exchanges, free hep c/hiv testing, suboxone doctors, narcan distributors, and AA/NA meetings for those thinking of recovery. It would also have an FAQ similar to this sub reddits. My app would be aimed at people who are still using, not necessarily those in recovery, though there would be a 'weekly goals' section if people were on the mend and wanted to keep track of their progress. It would be a web-based application (for now).  

I'm just trying to get an idea of if this would be helpful at all to addicts. My goal is to try and help others learn safe practices and techniques and have access to readily available information instead of having to browse the web. Any input/suggestions are welcomed, I'm still sketching out this idea so it's very malleable. Thanks for your time!

248w8f,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/248w8f/narcan_in_and_out_of_action/,7,https://redd.it/248w8f,ryanesthesia,Narcan in and out of action,"I wanted to make this post to inform you guys how well narcan works and how easy it is to use if you have it readily available when fixing and everyone you're using with knows what to do.

this all happened in one night and offers a great example on what you should and should not do to make your narcan as effective as it can and should be...

I rode to the city with 3 of my friends to cop a pretty large quantity of ecp.  After a few hiccups we finally had all of our shit and start fixing in a parking lot(definitely not ideal!).  I let the other guys do their shots first so I can make sure everyone is ok before I fix.  There's no point having narcan if everyone fixes at once and falls out.  this should be everyone's rule whether they have narcan or not.  Fix one at a time so if something bad happens, there is someone conscious to administer narcan/contact emts, deal with cops, etc.... This rule applies tenfold when using with just one other person. 

So i'm sitting in the back getting my shot prepared and my buddy next to me who had gotten his shit off the scales first was already doing his shot.  I'm mostly looking at the spoon in my lap and around the parking lot, making small talk with my other friends in the front seats.  I see the guy next to me, post fix, looking at his phone.  I get done preparing my shot when I really look at him and notice he's out cold.  I inform the guys up front that he's out, pull my narcan out of my kit and a clean insulin syringe(I didn't have the muscle syringe anymore).  I popped the cap off the vial, told the others to remain calm and keep on the lookout, pulled up 20 units and injected it into the muscle of his arm.  

From here I monitored his breathing, assured everyone he would be fine, and waited.  After 5 minutes of trying to wake him and getting no response, I pulled another 20 units up.  This time however I tied him off at the wrist and injected the narcan directly into a vein in his hand.  Within another 5 minutes he was coming to, still not fully understanding what had happened.  But thanks to being attentive, prepared, and calm, we saved my friends life.

Later that same night after we had made the drive back home and gone our separate ways things went much differently for my two friends who had been in the front seat.  I gave them my extra vial of narcan to use just in case.  They had just picked up more dope than they'd ever had so I wanted to make sure they were safe.  At some point in the middle of the night they were fixing up but the guy in charge of the narcan hasn't told the other where he had put it.  he did his shot first and (this is all hearsay as I wasn't present) while the other guy was fixing he wasn't paying attention to how he was handling his shot.  After he fixes he finally looks up to see his buddy purple lipped, non responsive, not breathing.  He realizes he doesn't know where the narcan is, tries to ask(obviously to no avail) and realizes he is going to have to call the paramedics because he doesn't want the guy dying while he's searching for a vial of narcan he has no clue to the whereabouts of (that sentence was hard to write).  Luckily my buddy is trained at CPR and kept the guy breathing until paramedics came and revived him and carted him off to the er.

Then the cops came.  They had no problem finding the narcan, the paraphernalia, and other things.  They made my friend who had just saved a life quite miserable and threatened him with jail, etc.  then the guys family got involved.  They have been harassing my friend since the incident blaming him for almost killing their baby instead of thanking him for saving the life of their irresponsible loved one.  If these guys had just established the location of the narcan before fixing, all of this grief could have been avoided.  

so go get some narcan! Tracey will gladly send you some.  Learn how to use it, teach your friends how to use it, and make sure everyone knows where it is located before fixing ONE AT A TIME!  you can wait another 5 minutes to get your fix if it means saving your friend's lives, right guys?

Shout out to Tracey! (/u/traceyh415) we love you and the amazing work you do!  Be safe out there guys!  If anyone has advice too add, please feel free!

Like, I'm sitting there nodding and going, oh yeah I just got back from Brazil where I was in a jail cell with William s Burroughs...then I shake my head...what the hell, that never happened....then again I'm back into the nod and thinking, ""what am I going to do about my cancer surgery""- again something will jar me out of it and I'm like- Jesus, I don't have cancer- I'm not having surgery. 

I swear this must be what it's like for someone with schizophrenia or other psychosis. Very weird. Just wondered if anybody else or is it just me? 

(also, no history of psychosis, only mild depression/ADHD. Do not take any other meds).

I do remember when I worked in an ER- a very nice older lady came in with a broken hip. She told us she was allergic to Morphine and that it made her ""crazy"". She was completely sane and normal, lived independently etc. The doctor ordered a shot- it may have been Demerol but I don't remember (many years ago)- and she went CRAZY- screaming about aliens abducting her and all this other stuff...it was a violent and bizarre change...but when the meds wore off she was completely sane again.",1398722248.0

I stayed off opiates for most of the duration of my stay there but towards the end of my sentence I came across someone who had recently been transferred from a prison in Liverpool who had brought with him about 0.5 of 'putty' heroin. He was not a user and had presumably cheeked it, bringing it with him to barter for tobacco/food/toileteries/whatever else. 
The vast majority of H in the UK is afghan no. 3 but this certainly looked nothing like it. Unlike tar I've seen in the states its surface was not varnished-looking or shiny. It was not at all sticky and was relatively brittle. Looking closely at it in natural light, one could see crystally sparkles in it. I had heard from prisoners who'd lived in the north of the country that they had come across this type of gear.

I couldn't resist passing this up and, having taken a 6-month opiate break, this little chunk smashed me and had me nodding out and crying tears of joy for 4 consecutive nights, smoked on foil. 
I don't recall that it tasted like black tar, more like good afghan.

Whether it’s nobler in the mind to suffer from life’s bullshit

And the boredom of sobriety 

Or run and go back to opiates’ warm embrace 

But totally piss off my family?

I'm in a fucked up conundrum guys. I've been sober for 4 going on 5 months and I want to use so bad. I have the chance to use but I know that if my family finds out I'll be disowned. But I don't want to stay sober. My life is extremely stressful because I'm around a bunch of domineering, micromanaging assholes who think that   if they keep me inside the house, I'll stay sober. For some reason they think that staying in a toxic environment will prevent me from relapsing. I basically live the life of an 80 year old. I'm bored, annoyed, and frustrated. 

If I do relapse and get found out then I'm fucked. I'll be on the street and my family won't talk or support me. I just can't do this strict sobriety shit any more. I started drinking a lot more and it sucks. I would rather take tramadol than drink. But I can't take anything because my mom has 100+ at home drug tests and she'll use them if I appear too sleepy, if I have red eyes or a stuffy nose, and other shit. 

TL;DR I'm fucked and no matter what decision I make, I'm screwed. To be honest, I would be better off dead. I'll feel like shit sober or high so what's the point? Anyway, I hope you guys have a better day than me and thanks for listening to my rant.

I tell her ill see her on my lunch break around 11. 11:01 she texts me saying ""whats up, u still want that""  im like yeah in a min. I finally go to the spot and let her know. Then she says just come to her spot outside her place. Im like im walking and not trying to stand at a tree in the middle of the ghetto. I walk down one more fast food place and shes supposed to be up here. Anyway im just a little nervous of this beinh some type of setup or she has garbage and is trying to get rid of it fast. Cause she normally wont text me a bunch of times if i dont hit her up first. Anyway im bored and little nervous waiting. Oh and i also dont have my lucky charm/hiding spot with me today. And im very superstitious.

Edit: i got up with her. I wont know til tmrw if its any good cause i gotta take my ua first. At first it looked like some mediocre shit i got from them a couple weeks ago, but its actually a little lighter and smells better.

Edit 2: Passed my drug test and actually had a really good session with the lady. Of course i still had dope in me 2min after i walked out of the appt. I had gotten a bundle of scar faces and didnt open them up til just now. I dumped 2 out and saw that one was brown and the other off white. I hate getting 2 different kinds if i havent tried both yet cause one is always better than the other. But yeah i did one of each and am feeling fucking nice as you may be able to tell by my typing too much.",1398700946.0

Basically, I've got my first meeting with a new PCP a week from today. My back is effed. Two bulging discs. Also have neuropathy from drinking. I have been seen for all of this stuff in AZ and been prescribed oxycodone for pain. Basically want to figure out the best way to approach this appointment next week. 

Not sure how the doctors dispense scripts in Oregon. Don't really want to walk out of there with a script for vicodin as that doesn't do much  of anything for the pain and also don't like apap due to the effect it has on my (already fucked) liver. Any advice?

And one of the constants I've encountered in this lifestyle are people who always talk about getting clean, or how they wish they'd never started, or how all the magic is gone and now they just get high to avoid withdrawals. Literally everyone I hang out with in this game at some point utters some variation of those famous words. And it makes no difference if they're people I know in real life or online, at some point I'm going to have to hear about how this is the last time they're getting high and after this they're done.
Don't get me wrong, I understand the stranglehold addiction has on people. How they may eat those brave words a few days into the endless shitting, vomiting, muscle pain, and sleepless nights. I also get that some people reach a point where its no longer sustainable and they make the informed choice to try and break away. But it seems to be a common sentiment, even among people who haven't even gone through ""baby's first habit"" yet. Opiate users of all walks seem to never stop talking about how they're finally quitting for real this time, or want to quit some day, or how others should quit while they're ahead.
Maybe I don't get it because I never graduated to IV, or I never had a habit that was so expensive I had to do some dirty deeds to keep it going. But I've been using all sorts of opiates (pills and dope) for the better part of a decade and I'm completely unapologetic about it. I refuse to lie to myself and others. I don't tell people I want to get clean, I don't make plans to get clean in the future, and I don't try to scare off new users with horror stories of addiction. I enjoy what I do and rather than try to plan my exit, I plan for long term sustainable practices and harm reduction techniques. I educate my fellow users about the honest pros/cons of their choices. And I support those who do try to make a clean break from the life. But should they wind up back to using I'm also there to hook them up with some free bags and nice conversation.

Basically I find myself having no desire to quit. I've been a dope user for the last 3 years (snorted). I've dealt with withdrawals that have lasted up to a week, and always just accepted that its the price we pay. I've managed to keep my tolerance relatively low, especially when compared to my peers. And I've had my dealings with police and the law, thankfully never having to be locked up for more than an evening. So I've been around the block. But I don't have the same jaded attitude towards opiates that other seasoned users do. I'm completely content to think that I may be on and off opiates all my life. Maybe my view will change in the next decade for me, who knows. But I honestly don't think so. I honestly believe that I'll be okay with the fact that I have an opiate habit until the day I die. I've accepted all the good with all the bad, and I have no one to impress. I won't lie and say I want to stop if I'm content with my life. Does anyone else feel this way? I know this kind of attitude is common among early users who haven't made it past codeine and vicodin, or weekend warriors who eventually fall into daily use. But are there any of you out there who have experienced what this life has to offer and accepted it without regret? ",1398831078.0

The glory has come and gone. The sweet romance that these lovely opiates have brought me has somehow vanished in the whirlwind of stealing, lies and highs.   
I'm on my way to sobriety. I have the mindset of being in recovery and now every time I get high I kind of kick myself a bit and feel guilty.   
The highs are less euphoric and for some reason sobriety feels a lot better than it used to.   
Now,  I'm not clean. But I have stopped buying dope every 2 or 3 days. I've settled down a bit.. I need to save your money and not blow it all on smack.  

My parents found out I have an addiction to opiates,  and it's about time to slow everything down to a halt.

I have a condition (keinbocks + arthritis) which causes me quite a bit of pain in my wrists/hands. I am 35 yr old male and I have dealt with addiction in the past (meth for about 3 years when I was 16-19) but I have been ""clean"" for the most part since then. I have had the same (good) job for 11 years and my career is in IT. Since I have to type a lot my pain definatley effects me at work.

Over the last few years I have been taking Vicodin off and on for the pain from my wrists. On average I get 30 pills every 2 months or so.
 Lately I have been wanting them more and more and going through them faster....I just called my doc last week and got 30 more and it's only been a month since my last refill. I just took the last 2 pills today and I am debating if I should try doctor shopping...or just man up, deal with the pain ...continue to walk the line ...or give in and just get more. I have found a pain clinic that charges 250$ consultation fee and 150/visit follow up fee's. They don't accept insurance so from what I can tell these folks will hand out pills as long as you have a medical need (which I do) and are willing to pay the cash. 

So should I turn from this path or continue......just looking for any input...the vic's I took this morning are already wearing off and I am starting to get cranky instead of that warm, fuzzy feeling.",1398798795.0
