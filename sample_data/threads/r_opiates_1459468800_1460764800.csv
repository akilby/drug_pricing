I'll be real with you I used to smoke pills and smoke fent patches before I moved to heroin and before when I just started using the fent patches I really didn't understand what kind of special hell opiate addiction is but I found out real quick what a cold bitch opiates could be. 

With fent the line between high and OD is super super thin. The first time I overdosed one second I was completely fine just nodding a little bit and then I took another hit and woke up with my wife sobbing over my body and my asshole was frozen because she heard somewhere in an overdose putting ice cubes up the person overdosing ass will shock you back and by God it worked but she had to explain to the EMT crew that I was fine (at least she didn't tell them she shoved ice cubes up my ass)

The second time I wasn't so lucky and woke up in an ambulance withdrawing so fucking bad because they hit me with Narcan. 

Figured I had learned my lesson but Nope third time I overdosed on fent my wife was in Oregon and I was alone in Cali. I fell out by myself in my room. It just so happened that I was supposed to meet my mom for lunch and I wasn't answering my phone to confirm we were still going and she said she had the strangest feeling something was wrong so she drove to my house and I didn't answer the door and my dog was freaking out. This 5ft1 older lady straight scaled a fence to break into my house to find me face down on my bed completely blue she called 911 and did a sternum rub to try to shock my heart and some how I lived long enough for the paramedics to get to my house and hit me with NarCan again 

I remember nothing before the ambulance but I will never forget the feeling of being hit with Narcan and as you come back to consciousness your vision is blurry and for some reason you are deaf and everything is super muffled ( it sounded like the teacher from Charlie Brown wok wokwok wok) and your confused and scared and withdrawing and then the paramedic letting you know you should be dead and everything hitting you all at once and realizing how bad you fucked up then you get to the hospital to look into your moms eyes, the same eyes that watched as her child was dying right infront of her and she could do nothing but pray. That's a look you will never forget. 

Once you start using the line between recreation use and being a junkie is a dangerous one to cross. Sorry this was a super wall of text but I just wanted to convey the depravity of being an addict. I know your just thinking of trying oxy but that's how I started and I  truely hopej√ø you think this through before you make your choice.

Anyway, my[22F] most recent partner[23M] and I started seeing each other last semester when he was just coming off some 6-month meth binge. It didn't raise any red flags cause I've lived a pretty sheltered life and had never really been acquainted with a ""junkie"" that would fuck me over. I actually found it kinda charming that he was willing to even admit that to me. For the first few months we were together, we didn't do much more than drink occasionally, and I was still getting to know him so everything seemed fine. He made it seem like it was this big deal to be sober and have a girlfriend, but I thought it was like honey-moon period flattery. On Halloween, we went to Vegas together (my idea) and he brought heroin and meth (his idea). At that point it just seemed like a romantic gesture cause I'd never been near a needle before, so it was this innocent, intimate thing for me. But it wasn't long before I noticed he had the tendency to get into kind of a mental fog whenever he was motivated to shoot more. I got that, cause I was totally down to party too, but I guess it became noticeable when it cut into our sex life. We live in different cities so I only saw him on the weekends and honestly assumed he only used with me. Around that time my ex was reaching out to me, having been struggling with his own addiction after we broke up so I guess I had been too preoccupied dealing with him and trying to keep up with grad school. 

By Thanksgiving I had figured out my partner had been using that whole time but still didn't think it was my place to say anything. One night I didn't want to do any more because he was fixating on using a rig that was already fucked up and I'm no phlebotomy expert but I thought I should intervene. He thanked me and I felt really good about that when we went to bed. A moment later he went back to the bathroom while I got comfortable. Next thing I know he lunges out and nearly collapses on the floor. Couldn't get a word out of him or keep his eyes open, I just knew to make sure he got uninterrupted airflow, and that I should probably google medical amnesty laws. So I leaned him up against the wall and monitored his chest compression and heart rate until he regained consciousness at like 5 AM. I was scared, but I didn't want to make him feel self-conscious because I knew he wouldn't remember a thing and feel bad for worrying me. I let him go to bed, but still brought it up in the morning. I had already been overwhelmed with concern for my ex's addiction so I told him I was kinda over the drugs. Maybe I was too casual, I'm not even sure he agreed to any of these things. I just always assumed he was sober when I was because we both had lives to attend to and stuff. I tended to delegate drugs for sex, I couldn't imagine doing them without him around, and I of course wasn't wondering if he had any left or would seek it out. By that week, I was probably too busy with final exams for him to say anything and then I had to vacation overseas. When he told me on Skype, it came as a shock but I was forgiving, and reminded myself I should be willing to work with him if he can at least be honest. Again, I tried not to be pushy, but I told him I wouldn't want to be with someone too deep into that shit - whatever that meant. I never felt okay asking him to quit indefinitely because I didn't want to establish that expectation for myself. I wasn't gonna do anything overseas so it didn't seem like a pressing issue on my end but I was immensely proud of him for taking the initiative to commit to rehab. It was on his own terms so he got out after thirty days but didn't stay in like an oxford home like he had planned and relied on me for most of that support. 

Then my ex passed away. His postmortem results are still processing so I can't say what happened but he had been on psychiatric hold for 72 hours prior. He called asking to be released under my care as his wife, but he was in a different state and I guess they let him out anyway. His mother told me in the morning. While I was just numb that first week, I recognized I was in no position to lend my partner the kind of support I had before. Not that I had expected him to be there for me, but I knew it would seem much more skewed if I couldn't take my time to grieve. If I ever had an opiate craving, it was then, because I had explored them with that ex and coincidentally wanted to forget that he too had first sought it out as a romantic gesture. I miss him. I may not have processed everything yet, but I don't  want to lose another loved one. Not like this. My partner relapsed just a couple days later, and I was not emotionally-equipped to give him the same magnitude of support he had grown accustomed to, and he was too strung out to give a shit about what I was going through. I was still somehow under the impression even that relapse was a one-time thing, and that things would go their course and he'd stay sober because he had been religiously recounting the fucking twelve steps whenever I'd engage him. I also thought I would inherently be a threat to his sobriety if I couldn't promise I'd never want to flirt with another substance again. But in his eyes if I had been using behind his back while he was trying stay clean, that would be like cheating, so when he couldn't uphold the standard he himself imposed, I was relieved to break up. 

Things had improved on my end, but I visited him last week to help him move, and he looked like he hadn't slept all week, so when he suggested we get back together, it finally hit me that he was an addict. Since then, I've been kind of spending time with him for his sake. It's not that I don't want to, but I am really afraid of inadvertently setting him off through text or something and not being able to help mediate his thoughts in person. I can usually talk him out of his impulses, at least until he's compelled to shut me out of the bathroom. I told him all I can commit to is unconditional acceptance. I don't want to invest in him emotionally, but I don't want him to feel like his behavior disappoints me as a friend. I've seen a full spectrum of shitty addict mentality, it's forgiven, I get it. When he used to use in my presence I'd usually pass up because I didn't want to be the kind of partner that enabled him all the time, and I thought I'd rub off on him by acting responsible. Now I stick around and take him up on his offers hoping it'll detract from the shit he's been inflicting on his body for years already. It's just been meth these two days but let me just say I've only tried it a handful of times mixed with something else so smoking it at his pace leaves me feeling sick and overwhelmed. I have like this phantom aftertaste in my mouth now. I just really want him to be done with it. He's going to work for his family in Indiana next week, and I'm still unsure of how I can help him. I think he'll maintain sobriety without his connects there, but I don't know how to keep an eye out for him. I obviously haven't given my current approach much thought, but I've gotten to the point where if I can assume he'll stay on this track, I can say I'd prefer he not be alone for whatever comes next. I like to think he will be okay, but I don't know that, and I would rather he die in front of my eyes than have to go through any of this alone. What should I do?

**Edit:** I should clarify, he's had a penchant for amphetamines since he was a teenager, I don't think he even feels it....but heroin addiction is something else and I am having trouble figuring out how I can encourage mindfulness and self-control without encroaching on his autonomy",1459520187.0

About 5 minutes before it went down I took 2 benadryl and less than 2 minutes before I took a small (for me) dose of xanax which I usually don't take when using dope. Neither would have had time to actually take effect and I still had similar anxiety levels. I should mention the second shot gave me an intense burning sensation throughout my body for about 20 seconds. This is common for me though with certain batches of dope and i believe its just an allergic reaction to a commonly used cut and usually doesn't get bad as long as I take some benadryl beforehand and would never be so drastically worse from adding just one bag.

WD symptoms for me start at day 3 and it is intense vomiting, dehydration and no sleep for 1-2 nights. I need this methadone to completely take those WD's away.

Ethan Hawke plays Chet Baker, even though I don't have anything against him, this was a minor red flag. However he manages to handle the job pretty well, even managing to strike a huge resemblance. 

The period covered here is sort of Baker's ""lost years"" - starting with his release from an Italian prison in 1966 (and thus one of his few truly clean periods) and the mess he makes of an offered comeback in Hollywood after a non-payment to a dealer results in his losing his front teeth, no small disaster for a trumpet player. 

It seems as if the story tries to emphasize the negativity and hardships that he would have probably used as his excuses for being an addict. From his own father to Miles Davis, everyone wants to keep pretty boy Chet in his place.

There's no way to tell a story about Chet Baker that will have a happy ending, although this movie tries and gets probably as close as you can, ending around 1973/74, when Chet had physically healed from the beating that left him toothless. This is the beginning of the comeback which would sustain him until his death in the mid-80s. And yet, Chet still manages to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory!

This happened Tuesday and my last dose was IV Monday before noon. As I'm pondering my position I figured I would just drink a shitload of water again and have it come back diluted again, then by the time I retest a second time I could just pass w/o and run around.    
I then review the employee handbook, ""A diluted sample requires resubmitting to additional screening. If the second screening returns a diluted result that result will be taken to be positive"". Fuuuuck me. No time to get fake pee, everyone in my life including my parents smoke weed. No chance of passing after <48 hours.    
So I pretended I had food poisoning on test day and showed up to work at noon. The test was then scheduled for the following day(Thursday) at 10am, barely over 72 hours after the dose. I then pounded mad water and ran like 10 miles over the next night. To be safe I still planned on giving a super diluted sample but did some research and found out that they can tell if you have been pounding water by creatine content in your urine and usually only check that when your piss I clear.    
So on my way to work I bought some creatine supplements(to mask how diluted the piss was) and some b vitamins(to color the watered down piss) amd pounded gallons of water approaching the test.   
I think I should be fine but on the off chance the test comes back diluted I'm going to complain and offer to retest that day(should be legit clean on Friday) and hope for the best.",1459445307.0

I had marks and bruises from not only where he injected but also from the bandaid I used to cover the mark! My arm was that messed up. 

I decided yesterday that I was going to finally try IVing to see what the hype was all about. I've been muscling it for quite a while now and I wanted to see what the difference was. Now, I should tell you that I'm chubby, maybe not fat, but definitely chubby. You CANNOT see my veins AT ALL. When I had tried once in the past I couldn't even find my veins to successfully IV.

Well yesterday I decided to give it a go again. I took a hot bath to try to make my veins more prominent. After I got out, I used a tourniquet and decided it would probably be best to try to hit my veins on the top of my hand and the first try I got it! I don't know, something about seeing the blood fill into the syringe is so satisfying. The dope hit me immediately of course but it only lasted like 15 minutes. I was super disappointed to be honest. I didn't leave any mark at all though, you can't even tell I shot up. Now, although being able to hit a vein in the first try and seeing the blood flow in was super satisfying, I wasn't satisfied with the duration of the high. The way the high hit me was also a let down. I expected so much more. 

I think I'm going to stick to IMing. It lasts so much longer. I know that I'm more at risk for abscesses, and trust me, I've had my fair share, but since I've been using needles only once, being super clean and careful, I haven't had any issues. The high lasts so much longer that way.

He met this guy, Eric, in there. Eric gets oxycodone Roxy 15s and Opana 40s, the crushable kind. Okay, he got kicked out of the nursing home and my dad said he could stay at our apartment (so it's just been Eric and me here) in exchange for some Opana, which he couldn't get filled until this past Wednesday. 

Anyway, Thursday, I asked Eric if he could give me a quarter of one of his Opanas. He said ""no"". Then I was like, ""well, you said you were going to give my dad two for staying here, and he said you could give me a quarter off of one of the ones you were going to give him"". Well, he starts saying that he's not going to give my dad anything, because supposedly he heard from this social worker named Terri (he's been playing her to get rides and shit) that my dad was gonna be drug tested since he was holding onto his pain meds for later and one of the nurses caught him. Well, dad talked to several nurses and this Terri chick, and they said they have no plans to test him. My mom was a nurse and said that if they were going to, they'd have already done it.

So, it seems like Eric made that shit up just to get out of paying us what he owes us for staying here. So, Thursday, I called him out on it and told him he's being an asshole, and he owes us for letting him stay here. He started going on about how he's been buying me food and cigarettes, and how he doesn't owe us anything because of that or whatever. Bull fucking shit, he does too because a fucking agreement was made. 

He left Thursday after I told him he was an asshole, but came back today because he didn't have anywhere else to go. He did give me a little bump of Opana this morning, but still. If I weren't afraid that he'd get some homeboys to get revenge, I'd kick him in his bad leg and fucking take what he owes us. I'm hoping I can keep him here until my mom gets back. Her brother just died, so she's been up with her sister in West Virginia all month dealing with that stuff. I just know if she were here, she'd deal with it quite handily. I mean, she'd try to talk to him and convince him to pay what he owes, but I know if she couldn't, she'd go off on him, probably kick his ass, and still get what we're owed.

It hurts me pretty bad, because yeah I'm in pain with my back, my hand, and my tooth, but I'm more worried about my dad. His back is really bad and I want him to have something.

Idk, opinions?

Edit: I don't believe in Karma, but I find it funny how the chick he was staying with last night stole a couple of his Pandas while he was passed out. In fact, she stole two, which was what he agreed to pay us for just a couple days staying with us, when he's been here a month.",1459606543.0

My friend and I (at a college) went to get food at one of the campus restaurants tonight. It was about 10:30ish. We sat down and saw a guy sitting on a couch facing the same way as us in front of us. His head was tilted back, but he looked like an employee taking a nap during closing time. Weird, but whatever. Soon after, he started making some gasping noises and convulsing. We got up and checked him out only to find his eyes half closed, his skin as white as it gets, and needle marks that looked like the milky way all over his entire body. He was alone, dressed up in a nice button down shirt. His hair was nicely groomed. He had a trimmed beard. He had placed an order twenty minutes prior according to the cashier. I helped the only other customer other than myself and my friend put this guy on his side as fluid seemed to fill his lungs (we were both FirstAid/CPR certified, or that's what he told me at least. I didn't know him). I felt this man's skin as he suffocated on his own fluids. We opened his airway, but nothing came out. The EMTs came and performed CPR for between 15 and 20 minutes then carted him out hooked up to an AED and some bag thing, probably in an attempt to clear his airway. I can't imagine he survived.

I just want to say- this experience gave me some real perspective. Opiate addiction is fucked up. It's a heinous disease. The way out is not pretty.

4d05s0,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/4d05s0/my_suboxone_taper_and_advice/,3,https://redd.it/4d05s0,seanjamesonsion,My suboxone taper and advice,"Just posted this elsewhere, just trying to spread it around so people can see it, hopefully someone will find it helpful!

I have successfully completed my taper from suboxone/subutex and I felt like sharing my experience and some of my thoughts so that they might help some people to break free from opiate addiction.

Very brief history of my use - Active addiction: about 18 months, using oxycodone, morphine, >>>>>>, fentanyl, hydromorphone etc. Was an intravenous user. Went onto methadone program for about 2 years then tapered down and swapped to suboxone. Tapered suboxone over about 6 months. Now clean.

No point going into it any more than that, if anyone has any questions though I am happy to answer them.

The first thing I will discuss is the technicalities of the taper. I am not a doctor or a pharmacist, all my knowledge is from the internet/books etc. I try to cross-reference information but don't claim to be an expert, the following information is just my personal understanding of things.

When I swapped from methadone to suboxone I stabilised on 8mg, higher than I had anticipated but that's how the cookie crumbled. It took me a few months to get used to the suboxone, I believe due to its partial agonist activity as opposed to the full agonist activity of the methadone. It felt a lot different to be on, I was less sedated and had less 'euphoria'. Overall I didn't like the suboxone, I never felt quite right on it and this may have made coming off it easier, I'm not sure.

I will write my suggestions which come from my own trial and error experience with the taper. This is what I found worked the best after buggering it up a few times.

These are the dose reductions from 32mg, in case you are on a higher dose like that.

32mg 14mg 1.2mg
30mg 12mg 1mg
28mg 10mg .8mg
26mg 8mg .6mg
24mg 6mg .5mg
22mg 4mg .4mg
20mg 3mg .3mg
18mg 2mg .2mg
16mg 1.6mg .1mg

Now it will become apparent that the smaller doses are harder to achieve with suboxone strips, and if possible you should switch to subutex when you get below 2mg. It is my belief that 2mg/day of buprenorphine is far too high a dose to jump off. For 3mg use one and a half 2mg strips. It isn't too hard to break subutex up into small pieces, in the end you will be taking one eighth of a .4mg tablet, I didn't find it too difficult to break it.

So the doses are pretty self explanatory, in my opinion the higher your dose is the more you can reduce it by, so reducing from 32mg straight to 26mg for example shouldn't be too difficult.

Now in terms of how long you want to stay on each dose to stabilize, this is my theory:

The mean elimination half-life of bupe is 37 hours. Here is a small description I found:

By definition, the plasma concentration of a drug is halved after one elimination half-life. Therefore, in each succeeding half-life, less drug is eliminated. After one half-life the amount of drug remaining in the body is 50% after two half-lives 25%, etc. After 4 half-lives the amount of drug (6.25%) is considered to be negligible regarding its therapeutic effects.

So if we take the 37hr half life and multiply by 4 (the number of half lives it takes to reach a negligible therapeutic effect) we get an idea of how long it takes one dose to clear the body completely. 37 x 4 = 148. 148/24 (to get that in days) = just over 6 days.

My interpretation of that information is as follows: If I am on 8mg a day of bupe I am really taking 8mg a day plus what was left in my system from the previous 6 days. Each dose has a cumulative effect due to the extremely long half-life. This effect only plateaus at around day 6 when the initial dose is leaving the system.

How does this apply to reducing? My theory is that If you drop from 8mg/day to 6mg/day (just an example) then it takes roughly six days for the drug to reach its new, lower steady state. My own experience supports this. Once this new level is reached in the body, it took me personally at least three days to really settle into it, to let my brain chemistry adjust. So I would say that 9 days is the bare minimum to stay on each dose. Of course your mileage may vary and I can only speak from my own personal experience.

Now I say that 9 days is the minimum, personally I stayed on each dose for 10-14 days, depending on how I was feeling. If you don't give your body time to adjust to each and every drop in dose then you get a snowball effect of withdrawal symptoms that follows you all the way down and eventually overwhelms you. This happened to me on my first attempt, I had to take my dose back up and methodically reduce in accordance with the plan I had set out.

Now some of you may be thinking (especially if you are on larger doses) holy >>>> that's so >>>>ing slow, it's going to take forever. All I can say is that yes it seems slow, and it requires a huge amount of patience and persistence. Whenever I would get frustrated and start toying with the idea speeding things up or just jumping off I would say to myself one thing: I'm only going to do this once so I'm going to do it right.

I was very lucky to be dosing at a pharmacy and that my prescribing doctor allowed me to have six take aways a week. This obviously made dividing my doses into smaller amounts a lot easier. I don't really know what to say to people who don't have this option, other than try to stick to the plan as closely as your situation will allow.

In terms of withdrawal symptoms, this taper won't be entirely painless, that in my opinion would be impossible. However if you really stick to the the plan then any symptoms should be manageable.

Other medications can be used to address some of the symptoms of the reduction, personally I used amitriptyline to help me to sleep, I went briefly onto escitalopram to manage the anxiety I was getting from the withdrawals. Other than that I would stay away from anything habit forming like benzos, unless they are only used briefly. The one situation benzos may be appropriate for is the final jump from .1mg to 0mg, but I wouldn't use them for more than maybe five days. Other than that I used paracetamol and ibuprofen for pain, I also found steaming hot baths to be helpful for those deep agitating aches that opiate withdrawal causes. Oh I also sometimes used promethazine to help me sleep.

Basically just medicate your individual symptoms in consultation with your doctor.

I guess that'll do for now, I'll post this much and check up a bit later, I might have thought of some more things to add.

Please feel free to ask questions or, if you are qualified, to weigh in on any of the chemistry related things, obviously I just want this information to be as accurate as possible.

Good luck everybody, let me tell you that getting clean is 100% worth the (temporary) pain!!!

(edit) Just adding some other things now that I've had time to think. I don't know if it's better or easier to come off bupe than methadone, some people claim it is whilst others disagree. The reason I bring this up is because you might have read this and thought to yourself ""Well this is useless because I'm not taking buprenorphine, I'm on methadone/morphine/oxys/whatever."" I can't speak from direct experience but I believe regardless off the drug you are on you should be able to use the basic principles of this taper plan and apply them to your own situation (except maybe for >>>>>> as it is impossible to accurately gauge dosage).

So...
1. Find out the half life of the drug you are taking and multiply that by 4 to get a rough idea of the total elimination time (in days) from your system.
2. Add at least three days and up to seven days to this number to give your body time to adjust
3. Decrease in small increments e.g. for methadone you would reduce 5mg at a time until you got to about 20mg then drop in increments of 2.5mg. Or for oxys you would decrease 10mg at a time until you got to around 30mg maybe, then 5mg increments with perhaps some 2.5mg increments at the very end.

One thing I actually forgot to add is that I was finding it really difficult dosing only once a day when I got down to below 2mg, as I was aching at night and couldn't sleep. I have a history of chronic pain so it might've just been me. To solve this I split my dose into two halves, one in the morning and one at night. That's why it says above that I was breaking the .4mg subutex into 8 pieces!!!! Doh!

Ok, that'll do for now. Peace people.",1459572912.0

I just picked up a half today of some decently flame ECP. I also scheduled an appointment at a Suboxone clinic, which also takes insurance. Bingo! I'm feeling rather optimistic that this will be my last scoop for a considerable amount of time. My first appointment is early next week and I have 3 8 mg strips to cover me for the next 3 days. I have not been using frequently, so I don't even anticipate debilitating withdrawal symptoms.

I really want this to be it. I've never been RX'd Suboxone for maintenance therapy and I honestly believe it will provide me with sufficient relief from cravings and low energy, which will allow me to engage in a program of recovery. I've also noticed it has been more helpful than my SSRI's in treating my depression.

**My Program of Recovery**

I plan to attend 3 or 4 meetings a week, hook up with a sponsor, work the steps, and volunteer for service commitments. Outside of AA, I'll finally have enough energy to exercise. I always run when I'm on heroin or Suboxone, so I'll run 3 or 4 times a week. I'm already seeing a psych monthly who is prescribing me an SSRI. I plan on asking him to also prescribe me Lyrica (pregablin) for anxiety, because I've heard it's actually pretty effective. I'll also ask him about my concerns regarding borderline personality disorder and whether he can refer me to a DBT group.

ADDITIONALLY, I'd like to find a therapist in my insurance network who specifically works with patients suffering from BPD and social anxiety. I'd like to develop some tools for better handling these disorders, but more importantly, I've found that it is incredibly helpful to have someone outside the AA network to talk with one-one-one.

I work and go to school and plan to ask for more hours at work, while simultaneously finishing the semester strong and insuring I graduate the following year by taking my spring and summer courses seriously.

Last, but not least, addiction sucked away all my passions and hobbies. I love music and always intended to make music, primarily  by sampling old soul. I've made a few beats and provided many potential samples to friends who do make music, but I think it would be healthy to develop a hobby I'm proud of.

Thus, I'm heading back to the fine facility I went to in November to eat like a king and get my libido back. This place lets you have your electronic/communication devices back after 5 days so I'll be back online on Wed-Thurs of next week.
Wish me the best! Hopefully it sticks this time!",1459541331.0
4cxm0o,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/4cxm0o/tifu_by_attempting_to_put_the_cap_back_on_my/,46,https://redd.it/4cxm0o,NodEazy,TIFU by attempting to put the cap back on my syringe.,"So about two years ago. I did a shot of dope and went to put the cap back on the syringe. I pushed down on the cap to get it to click on. And the needle must've bent somehow as I was putting the cap back on this NEW needle. Because, as I pushed down, the needle penetrated through the side of the cap from the inside. And stabbed the fuck out of me. I mean it didn't hurt that bad cause, you know, it's a half inch insulin syringe. But I'm still a little bitch so I did take about 1 damage. Which luckily regenerates very quickly, because of my delicate selection of perks. But it still freaked me out. 

So TODAY comes around. About 10 minutes ago actually. And I had just completed the respectively mild task, of intravenously injecting 3mg of buprenorphine. And again. As I put the cap on. Very carefully I might add. Because ever since I got stabbed in the finger through the cap two years ago. I have been very careful putting my caps on . And motherfucker did this one hurt. I must be incompetent, because the needle stabs through the cap at roughly a 67 degree angle and penetrates over half an inch into my fucking thumb. 

So my natural reaction is to jerk the god damn thing out of my finger as quick as possible.  So I do. And my dumbass just kind of rips it out of my hand and let's go of it so it just kinda flies out of my hand. 
AND GUESS WHAT I SHIT YOU NOT. This needle lands perfectly on the the top of my foot and is sticking out of my foot like a fucking flagpole. FUCK. It must of hit a nerve  or something perfectly because my foot goes numb and gets really tingly. It's subsiding now but I can still feel it

And during all this I forgot to mention I'm butt ass naked taking a shit. And in the midst of all this madness. I also happened to piss about a 1/3 of my stream allover the toilet seat and the floor directly in front of the john. 
At this point I don't know how I feel. I mean. What fuck just happened. 

But has anyone else ever been stabbed through a syringe cap?
Also I'd love to hear your guys stories of funny junkie moments and fuck up's. 


tl;dr: I'm sitting on the toilet and stab myself in the hand and the foot with a syringe and piss allover the floor and toilet seat, all within 5 seconds.",1459539474.0

  So junkie jesus and I have never officially met, in fact it's usually the complete opposite of that for me.  Anyway, I was outside smoking at work earlier this week and got to talking to a guy that works for another company in the same building, cool dude.  Anyway he was telling me he couldn't get going cause he had taken too much of his medicine the night before, so of course my ears perked up.  He starts telling me how he takes morphine, roxys, and Valium and how he loves the oxy but always has extra morphs and Valium.  I tried to hide my excitement and be cool, I said if he ever had an extra Id love to try one.  

So I was just getting back from lunch and I see the dude walking to his car and he waves me over.  Dude goes into his car and hands me 10 of the pink oval 30's (N 30 marking) and 10 Valium!  Quite a nice little gift!! Anyway my question is regarding IV prep for the morphs, supposedly they gel up really bad so I was wondering if anyone has a reliable method for prepping these bad boys?

4cx7ft,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/4cx7ft/a_message/,14,https://redd.it/4cx7ft,tanaeolus,A Message:,"Sometimes you just have to realize when you have a toxic person in your life.  I refused to believe that my SO was the root of many of the problems that were in my life because I loved him. I loved him *so* much. I tried to be there for everything, I tried to give him all I could. And maybe I didn't do these things at all times throughout the years, but I tried so hard to love him. To be there for him when nobody else was. But I too am an addict. And I know I'm not perfect.

He was charming, intelligent, and generous in the way that suited him. But he was selfish. So, so selfish. Impulsive. Chaotic. He loved drama, or at least created a lot of it. He certainly never thought, ""Hey, maybe I *shouldn't* do this, just because I feel like it.."" No, he lived every moment to his every whim. He was going to love you, he was going to get high, he was going to spend money and live lavishly. He was going to buy the large milkshake and the medium rare stake. He was going to have his cake and eat it too. 

The short story is, just two months ago I was on the street and destitute, with a running, but wrecked car. No more than 6 months ago my mother changed her phone number because of me. And she had an awesome phone number. (I'm sure there was some other reason, knowing her, but that's the one she gave me.) A couple of months ago, I would have woke up early in a car with a dead battery. Walked to the methadone clinic. I would have tried to get some bars, probably settle for a beer, then had deal with benzo sickness for the remainder of the day. I would have held a sign and made money for food and more beer. I would have listened to NPR and slept in my car. And now I'm here, in the suburbs of sunny Southern CA, house-sitting for my mom and two weeks away from starting school. Today, I woke up in a house. On a couch, but warm. I took an eighth of a suboxone strip and made coffee. I smoked weed and a cigarette. I told my mom I loved her and she wished me goodbye but not for good. 

Only one thing has changed, but it has changed so much. I left my husband. It is amazing how in an instant, by one decision, everything can change. It almost gives me a start of fear to think about it. He is no longer in my life. The one that I had devoted myself to, the one I said I would spend the rest of my life with. Did he ever love me? I used to think I was different to him. That he would never put drugs before me. I made excuses and thought up convoluted reasons why he did the things that hurt me so much. But then it finally came to a breaking point. I looked at all the chaos around me. Was it worth it to keep going like that? How did it get like that in the first place? I didn't have any other choice but to leave. He went to jail. I called my mom. She was leaving for CA. What could I do? Should I have stayed, homless and alone, in the dangerous ghettos of the city? Wouldn't he want me to be safe? Without having the choice of being with him I finally had the chance to evalute where my life was and why for the first time in a long time.

The truth is sometimes I don't know if I did the right thing. I still care about him very much. He was a huge part of my life, but I just have to let that chapter go. I know that the life that I'm living now, feels a lot better than the life I was living before. Sure I still think about using; I think about often. But honestly, a lot of the time it scares me. It terrifies me how quickly everything can change. In an instant things could easily go back the other way. I don't want that. I can't put myself or my family through that again.

You might want to try to evaluate the people you surround yourself with. Do they really have a positive impact on your life? Do they actually do things or just talk about them? Do they tell you they love you or do they show you? You might want to think about cutting those toxic people out of your life. It is astonishing how much lighter I feel now. When I think about all the problems I used to have, I realize that almost all them were his problems that I thought I needed to fix. And as cliche as it sounds, it is true, ""You can't help anyone until you can help yourself."" When you're in a chaotic relationship it's like a torando. When it's surrounding you it's all you can see or think about. It's when the tornado moves on that you can finally see all the damage it's left behind.

---I wrote this a couple of months ago and it still holds true.  I'm still clean, I haven't touched opiates (or anything besides weed) and I'm *slowly* (trying to) lower my suboxone dose.  I'm still in school (stay in school kids :P), and getting *paid* to do so. And above all, I'm actually, somehow miraculously, generally pretty happy.  Life is good, don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

TL;DR: Evaluate the people in your life. I cut a toxic person out of my life and it turned things around.",1459535458.0

I'm  in Central Texas and hadn't had time until a couple weeks ago even though this stuff is double price by weight it's at least 3 to 4 times better once I started doing it I would wake up sick anymore.

 anyway in 8th grade I traded my friend a lot of my mom's Xanax and Ativan exchange for his mother's OC thirties I got to the point where I was doing 10 a day,   my first day of high school I went and took 10 of them with me and doing all of them by lunch the next couple days I couldn't go to school because I felt awful I had yet to figure out that I experiencing withdrawal.   three-quarters of the way through sophomore year I dropped out due to excessive marijuana use I got my GED.

 after that when I say year I had three roommates and 5 to a dozen people staying at my house every single night of course we were all using various drugs and I was going to a high school called Premier where you essentially get your work done in packet form.   had to get up early to go to school in the morning that everyone was passed out and we'd had a pretty big adventure the night before I was sleeping in class and they took me out and handcuffed me and told the principal I was on heroin which I wasn't I had been last night but I wasn't at the time,  the police said obtained a warrant to search my house due to the night before I had purchased twice from somebody that had delivered to my house and then let they let him go in exchange for him signing an affidavit claiming that he'd sold it to me

 I was only 16 years old and I got the charge of distribution of heroin, I come back to my house from my school and everyone sitting on the couches and floor and the assorted rooms in handcuffs after being abruptly awakened by the police at 8:30 only an hour after I left that morning.

 I ended up getting probation which of violated numerous times and when my father and I had a meeting with my probation officers boss we hit it off with her so Good by connecting over a True Blood poster she had in her office that she essentially told my PO to let me take the test by not monitoring me and letting me put water in it, ( I mean he made sure to ignore the creatine levels and the temperature and just so negative on everything and immediately handed it back to me to throw away

 that was five years ago I was on methadone for a year but they kicked me out a while ago and this is how I spend most of my day reading y'all's beautiful posts.

I'll go first.,"So i've been using dope on a relapse for the past 6 months after being clean for 3 years. Today I truly realized how powerful this shit is and the lengths we will go to get high. 

So I had thrown out a few of old rigs in my trash (that had food, etc.) and only had one remaining rig. Being the junkie that I am I left that bag on my back porch instead of going 50 yards to the dumpster and tossing it out. That bag had been outside in the hot Atlanta sun for the past couple of weeks. When I got home from work tonight and was going to do my shot after being sick for the past 12 hours or so, I dropped my rig on the ground needle up and snapped it off. FUCK!! 

Since I refuse to snort dope I remembered I had a rig outside in that trash bag and thought ""Oh yeah it'll probably be good enough for one shot!"" before I can make it to Wal-Mart tomorrow to get more. When I opened the trash bag on the porch the most disgusting smell hit me and when I started digging toward the bottom where to rig was I saw it: A gigantic infestation of maggots and my rig siting right there in the middle of it them. I dug through the hundreds of maggots and slime to get my rig and after thouroughly, thoroughly washing it- used it. 

I don't know if you guys have done something similar but would like to hear you stories to not feel like such a disgusting human being.

  First your going to have to make a tooter to catch the heroin vapour that you will be inhaling from the back of the bettle of heroin as you chase it down the foil with the lighter and tooter . Fist get a rectangle of foil ... http://imgur.com/a/5XgQP

  Next you'll want to prepare a larger rectangle of foil about maybe 8"" by 5"" next you need to run your lighter over both sides of the foil making sure the flame comes in contact with the entire surface area . This is to remove any (most) harmful aluminium vapours from the foil that can cause an illness some sort of metal poisoning this is not necessary with the foil from the exchange as it is especially treated for smoking heroin . Next you'll want to make a channel running down the foil as in the picture . http://imgur.com/a/GAXSn Next you'll need your lighter to have a flame on it about 1cm height like in the picture and where to position the tooter when your chasing the beetle down the channel with your lighter . Once you run out of foil gently tease the beetle into a circle and carefully peel it off and put it on a fresh piece of foil and repeat .

We go Tesco and I get the money and some smokes and they get some munchies etc and head into the town centre where I'm dropped off . Head to my main dealer and thankfully she's got and I get a G then I head over to the taxi rank that's only 2 minutes away and hop in a taxi home üòä 
         The dopes not bad it's different stuff from a couple of days ago and I got a nice though not massive rush from it though I have had 60ml of methadone this morning so it'll dampen the H a little . I'd give it a 7.5-10 maybe 8 but it was just slightly under weight .

Taking the idea one step further, doctors could install PICC lines in junkies as a harm-reduction measure. Of course this will never happen, but think about it: no abscesses, no collapsed veins, no blood infections, etc.

First I wanna say grats to the new mods(sup fash!). Also I am truly sorry for the losses everyone has felt. Though I have not been posting daily like I use to I have been lurking the last  couple months and seen what has been going on. the whole situation is fucked. with yeaheroin gone and others dropping what seems every other day someone else bites the dust, theres no wonder why a lot more people want to get clean. I wish everyone taking the step to get clean the best of luck.

  This past month has been hard and today has probably been the hardest. 9 months ago(wasn't sure how long its been till I looked at my last opiate post, I gauged how longs its been off of my last opiate post.)
    I woke up a few hours ago after doing some meth with some friends. the first time I actually got my hands into the meth thing and fuck meth I was up for 3 days. That is not fun to me. my house is a fucking mess. My whole body Is sore, fucking sparring and working out like a dumbass on the shit. Every thing was going good for a while.. Since my last post I was in and out of detox( one baker act and 2 voluntary in a week time( I was in and out one time in a 24 hour period, it went voluntary got out, shot up, baker acted, voluntary again.
  I gave up my script of 180 diludid 8s morph and xannies I was getting for little over 5 years and  I been on the bunavali program since I last posted.
   Everything was going great for a while. I was on the bunavali and I was working again and I was working 12 hour shifts 9pm-9am 3 days on 4 days  off then vise versa every other week. Till about a month ago went I lost my job.. everything is sucking hard once again.
  My tolerance is high as fuck on these bunvali things where if I got 2 days im puking. they started me at 2 bunvalis a days which was to much and I knew it but told myself im just gonna do what the doc says( prob a mistake)
  still no fucking sex drive and been to depressed to even rub one out. its fucking ridciouslous. I want to want pussy but just could care less. it sucks.
  My sister little sis shes 25 im 27.  She has been in the hospital with Endocarditis for the past two weeks. She has literally no white blood cells on top of it. With a little pneumonia on top. Shes not getting any worse it seems, though she's just not getting any better. They were pretty much making her go through withdrawls which I think is just bullshit.
 No point to this post really. just realizing that im not any closer to getting clean then I was 9 months ago just traded one drug for another and had to get it off my chest.
 TL;DR: no longer get a script. lost my job. haven't been shooting pills and dope but strung out on subs, still no sex drive. sister in hospital fighting for her life which i assume is from shooting up what most of the time is shitty ass boy(florida) and pills. just woke up from my first and last 3 day meth binge(fuck meth yo)
 Not really sure where to go from here. I want to get high. i don't know what to do!

My first post was a few months back, just venting about what i have to go through each day just to survive. Then my sexond post was right after xmas, letting yall know that i had a stroke after accidentally hitting my cartoid artery instead of my jugular.
Anyway, I'm  almost 100% back to normal physically and as for my addiction the last few weeks I've been staying out of the city and just taking methadone each day out at my moms.
My problem right now is I've started taking klonopin, 2 mg 3 x day, and the the effect it has on the methadone is almost like I'm doing actual dope again. As an addict, i love it lol. I know that soon my body will be used to it and it'll be back to just feeling sober again and hopefully by then I'll have gotten a job, volunteer somewhere, anything to occupy my time.
The only reason this has become a problem is that I'm staying at my mom's since I started taking the methadone and my family sees the effect the mix has on me and are accusing me of being back on heroin. 
I obviously have no trust left with my family so they don't believe me. I know a ton of people who experience the same thing when mixing methadone and benzos and/or dope and benzos so i was wondering if anyone has any advice. Is there a site somewhere i could show them online that discuss this? I don't know, I'm desperate tho. If they aren't going to believe that I'm not doing dope then I'm going back to where i stay, which is on the west side of Chicago,  which pretty much guarantees that ill end up back on the shit.

Any advice, suggestions or even encouragement is all I'm really looking for.  This sub reddit has been a place I've been turning to in terms of finding people I can relate to and in a way I attribute it to helping me stay away from getting high.  I'm sitting up in bed after months off opiates, jealous that my girlfriend is a normal person and sleeps through the nights.   The sad truth is I fucked myself up really bad over the past 5-6 years with my oxy addiction and it's taking far longer to get back to 'normal' (whatever that is) than I anticipated.  I only get a full nights sleep Thursday-Saturday after fairly heavy drinking.  I will down a glass or two of whiskey some weeknights along with my nightly weed but even when that does help me get to sleep I wake up 3 hours later.  

I anticipated it would be a long shitty process to get back to 'normal' but I feel alright aside from sleep.  I should be sleeping a lot more by now I feel.  I have had sleep issues going back to even before my opiate use however it's been magnified by my addiction.  A big reason I quickly fell in love with oxy (along with feeling fucking awesome) was being able to sleep throughout the nights.  When I was younger (before opi use) I was prescribed Ambien then trazodone and finally seroquel but non of them ever worked correctly for me.  Though it was a different time in my life I am not confident any of the medications that failed me in the past work would now.

If anyone has experience with long term 'clean' time off opiates and has had similar issues, does it subside? I say clean in quotations because although I'm off opiates I'm far from sober in general.   Are there any other medications I should ask my dr about other than the common sleeping pills?  I've tried working out early in the morning or late at night to help tire me out but it either doesn't help or I didn't give it enough time.  It's to the point I need to pick up a hobby to fill the idle time I spend awake in bed because otherwise I lay here with my eyes closed yet wide awake for hours on end.  I'm so thankful to have this sub, it's therapeutic for me to converse with you guys. People I can relate to and who are down to earth.  My girlfriend, friends and family are all great but 95% of them can't relate. 

Any general advice on what I could try to get back on track would be greatly appreciated, I would be willing to try almost anything.  This idle time at night is the worst in terms of mental urges to do opiates and at this rate it's only a matter of time before I say fuck it and convince myself I can start small before falling back to 100s of MG of oxy a day...

This is one I like to call ""Flipper"", as in the dolphin, for reasons you'll soon find out.


So, this is probably the most embarrassing moment in my life to date. I love you guys so much I decided to share with y'all.



So, I was 19, going to college at the time, and had been flirting with this dude in my business class quite a bit. He was 26 (Oooh, older men he he), just out of the Navy, and looked like Clark Kent - black hair, piercing blue eyes, and built.,. Yummy. Anyways, after about a week of back and forth flirting, he invited me over for drinks and a raucous face off of Scattergories (handsome AND dangerous? Be still, my beating heart!) with him and his roommates. I told him that I had a doctor appointment earlier in the day, but that I'd be more than happy to head over afterwards.


At this moment in time, I had been on a break from dope, and was about 6 months clean off heroin. But I was drinking like a fish, smoking hella weed, and rolling whenever I could.


So the morning of the big date, I headed to this psych doctor I'd been referred to after my chest pain was found to stem from anxiety. Well, it  must've been my lucky (this is up to speculation) day, because Miss Shrink lady prescribed me 30 Xanax footballs a month. None of the older adults in my life were aware of the extent of my problem with drugs as of that time, so I was allowed to have my script on me.

So after my appointment, I picked up my script and headed home to dick around til it was time to head out and meet my date.


I noticed I was feeling pretty anxious, so I popped a football and went about my business. 45 minutes later, I was still feeling pretty anxious, so I dropped another one. An hour later, the xanax still hasn't kicked in. So I pop another. An hour later, same thing. It continues on this way until I'm six footballs deep, and finally, my date comes and scoops me up, and together, we made our way back to his crib.
I was very benzo naive at this time, and had only taken pilfered klonopins a handful of times, and was confused as to why I wasn't feeling  any better or different. But I just shrugged it off and went to work knocking back drinks and losing Scattergories with panache. A couple of hours later, I'm feeling.. Fucked up. And horny. His roommates are tired too.


So, when his roommates head to bed, my date and I retire to his ""room"", which is really just a loft with all the accoutrements of a bedroom. I'm feeling REALLY nice at this moment in time, but before I get naked with my sexy ass date, I really need to pee and freshen up. He guides me to his bathroom and, like a gentleman, waits for me.


Now, it's important to note the lay of the lay of the land here. This upstairs area is E shaped, and from top to bottom, its his loft, the stairs, and the bathroom, all connected by a long hallway..

After finishing up, I exited the bathroom to go he'd turned out the lights. Fuck yeah, about to get laid! I head toward the loft, still in the dark, and that's when I made a crucial mistake. Instead of taking the second right into the loft, I merrily take the first right. Extending a foot and expecting Terra firma, imagine my surprise when instead I stepped out into thin air.. And tumble ass over teakettle down his stairs! BUMP BUMP BUMP SMACK! Luckily, the wall breaks my fall with my forehead, putting a hole in the wall. My concerned date rushed down the stairs to my aid, laughing the whole way. Being high and drunk off my ass, I laughed along, unable to feel pain. He dropped me off at home the next morning, still chuckling. Unfortunately, I did not get laid.


But the best part is that after making an ass out and myself falling down his stairs and ruining his deposit (his roomies weren't too happy about that) with my forehead remodeling, I  had to see him in class for the rest of the semester. And when I went to class the next week, I had developed a rather large knot on my forehead, which stayed there for literally months after. He told me I looked like a dolphin with the melon on my head, and took to calling me Flipper the rest of our semester together. Fortunately,  he and I stayed friends, but oh man. Was that ever embarrassing haha!

Got handed a big ol' grey/tan rock of dope. I'm on East coast, usually just get powder with rocks in it. Took quite a bit of elbow grease to break 'er down which surprised me. I wasn't really prepared for it, I used my cash to purchase it and use a straw to toot it. So, first attempt I put a hole in the bag trying to bust it up and didn't even put a dent in it. So then I put cellophane over top of it and got it to break down a little bit which ended up putting a hole in the cellophane lol. Luckily I'm a lazy fuck and had a couple empty packs of cigs I discarded on the floor of my truck. Double wrapped it, and was able to bust 'er down completely. So I poured it onto the bathroom counter to put out a couple lines (usually just do bumps but had no choice. Cellophane isn't easy to scoop bumps out of!) It's a 2nd bathroom so I'm usually the only one who uses it so it should be safe for the evening. I'm just bummed I don't have a way to transport it in the morning.

I tried growing poppies, but they'd always get moldy or root rot-y and die, so lately I've been sort of interested in the kappa-opioid-agonist containing plant, Salvia Divinorum. 

Yeah, it may be hallucinogenic and not really give a rush or euphoria like other opioids, but I've interestingly read that kappa-opioid agonists, trippy as they may be, are actually helpful in combating addiction.  Along those lines, one chemical I'm sure most of you have heard of ibogaine, responsible for the traits of another trippy plant, and interestingly enough that plant has kappa activity as well.

You can have all of the theory in the world and still be wrong as fuck though, so I'm wondering if anybody here has smoked salvia and noticed any changes in their addiction, and especially if any of you have ever been able to grow it.  I figured that if someone here were able to grow it and use it somewhat regularly, that might shed some light on the long term effects it can have on actual opiate addiction, and that there would be presumably stronger evidence for it working or not working, since it would be fresh from the source with little alkaloid degradation, and unlike buying the dried extract, it wouldn't be something people did for a week then ran out of or whatnot.

Anyways, I suppose it's probably just a curiosity; I doubt anybody here actually happens to bother to grow it, even if we are now 20,000 members strong (whoo! go /r/opiates!  Yeah, heroin power!).  If any of you grow it, or know someone who grows it, feel free to PM me too if you're shy about publicly admitting to cultivation - I've got a lot of questions to ask and would really appreciate it, heh.",1459720764.0

Out of the 4 times I have missed my shot 3 of those time has been the entire shot cause it got to the point I could not fill the rig with any more blood. so basically just skin popped it out of frustration. I have not been able to catch more than just a mild buzz for well over a month or more which is frustrating in its own right. cause my wife will do the same amount as me every time and be knocked on her ass wile I barely have a buzz. I do not get this at all every time she will nod out so hard and I barely even feel it. I can't explain this at all considering we do the same amount as far as I know anyways. Any one have any idea as to why this is the part of her getting far more high than I do she weighs a lil more than I do do you think that plays any part in it idk what is going on any info or tips to help me achieve the high I used to. I know about tolerance and all that and dose accordingly. The last time I felt anything worthy of noting is when we split a 5 bag shot so would have been 21/2 bags each we will usually split 2 to 3 bags so would equal 1 to 11/2 bags each.

I said, we're in traffic, and besides, I've spent hundreds on dope for you in the past three weeks.
This guy freaked out and started trying to threaten me, telling me my ex-gf had left me because I was always so selfish, and even said he'd 'get street' on me if I didn't (as if the fact that I finished college and work an office job makes me so privileged when I put needles in me just like any other junky).
Well, I said that the talking had to stop, that he'd get what he wanted, but that the whole arrangement was finished.
Instaed of dropping him off at his house, I pulled up to a nearby supermarket, so when he inevitably resumed threatening me and freaking out he'd have to consider the fact that the interaction would be on their camera system. Sure enough, this tactic helped, and even though he tried to ask for more than a point of my gram, he had to relent when I grabbed my bag and my laptop, got out of the car, and said I'd report it as stolen unless the fool walked home right then and there.
Anyway, he messaged me apologizing today (as if!) and said that I'd have to accept his apology if I wanted to get well in the future.

Had fatigue, insomnia, the shits, no appetite, chills, but none too severe (I was able to go to work with some lope and Klonopin). 

I thought this weekend, I could use a few times and downgrade back to chipping after the 5 day withdrawal. I was feeling fine by Friday, first dose didn't even feel like a rescue from sickness or anything. So, used Friday night (one redose), Saturday morning, Sunday night, and woke up Monday okay, but by evening could feel a mild withdrawal starting from just those four or five uses. So I take 2 kpin to sleep tonight around 12am, after tossing and turning in discomfort for about an hour, my last U4 dose now about 24 hrs behind me. Well 2mg of clonazepam only gets me about 3.5 hours of sleep, and now I'm up at 5am writing this, woken up by discomfort of the RLS kind. 2nd time a few days use of U4 has turned a solid cpam dose into a weak, short acting sedative (I normally use 1mg to knock out for 8 hrs easily after a normal day).

Anyway, just more info to add to the limited U4 info out there. Typing this waiting for the rescue dose I just drank to kick in and let me sleep. Looks like I'm in for another bad week, next time night limit down to just 2 uses over 2 days and see what kinda mess that leaves me in. 

Ahhh, and there's that beautiful wave of warmth now, right on schedule. Bed is one again comfortable, I am once again sucked in and fucked, but at the moment... oh, sweet bliss. Nite all.

TL;DR don't buy 10g of U4 at once, or you're gonna have an awesome, terrible time.",1459858243.0

Not Mutually exclusive?,"I've been getting my dope from the same guy for over 3 years now. It's always been the same the whole time. It always looks and smells the same. It only has ranged in purity every 3 months or so but still always looks almost exactly the same. 

I acquired up a new guy from a work buddy recently because my dude was on vacation for a week and I didn't pick up enough. When I got from him that time it was very similar to the shit I always get. (Light brown ECP, smells like vinegar). So yesterday my guy wasn't answering, happens often but he always calls back and meets same day. I didn't feel like waiting yesterday and I had some stuff to do, so I called the new guy and picked up a G. When he gave it to me he said ""be careful, this stuffs extra fire"". Since I don't get from him a lot I figured he was just saying that and didn't think to look at the product. 

Whenever I went to fix up I noticed it was off white. This is the first time I have ever seen dope this white and I instantly thought of all the fent posts I‚Äôve been seeing recently. I proceeded with caution and did a test shot of about .025 (Normal fix-up dose is .15-.20). The ""rush"" was what I expected from the shot so I figured it was all good and must just be nor mal dope just white. Then a cop pulled into the parking lot of the fast food place I was at to get in the drive through line. I heeded the omen and drove the 50 minutes home. 

By the time I got home I was nauseous as hell and practically nodding off holding one eye open. The dope was hitting me so hard but like a whole hour after I shot it. This didn't make sense because everything I have heard about fent is the opposite. Like it's all rush and no legs. I proceeded with even more cation doing a slightly bigger shot and again it had a sub par rush but had me nodding my ass off 90 mins later. 

My question is simply has anyone ever heard of fent dope being like this? Or do I just have some ""china white"" or something and that's just how it is?

I will try to post a picture tomorrow morning but I only have about .2 left and I don't have a smart phone or camera at the moment to take a pic with. I live with non users so using their phone and deleting the picture just seems like too much a risk.

I've been on suboxone maintenance, methadone maintenance, the vivitrol shot, subutex tapers, gone cold turkey, and tried several other ways to quit. I've been to detox 15 times, then inpatient rehab after detox 12 times, IOP 12 times, gone to therapy for over 12 years, gotten the vivitrol shot about 5 times.. There has only been one thing that has ever worked to get me more than like 2 months clean strung together at once and that was getting pregnant. I don't judge any mothers for their mistakes, nor do I recommend getting pregnant to get clean by any means at all. Luckily, my pregnancy happened early in my addiction before the heroin really had me in its claws, at least in terms of physical dependency, but the moment i saw that positive pregnancy, I flushed my bags, meth, and pills. Then I gave my weed and cigarettes to my brother to enjoy, without any explanation. He was very confused about but grateful. And I then went immediately to my bed to sleep and cry hysterically out of guilt for the drug use i had already subjected the baby to for the few weeks she was growing inside be undetected and mostly because I wasn't sure i could remain clean after she arrived. I was sure i could stay clean until i met her though, and I would just focus on that. Well, I guess it was a self fulfilling prophecy because I relapsed with enthusiasm after staying clean with relative ease for about 19 months throughout my whole pregnancy and duration of time that I was breastfeeding. That relapse, in hindsight, was the biggest mistake of my entire life. I didn't have that ""need"" for dope anymore, u know what i mean.. That ache in ur belly, pain in ur bones, lump in ur throat u get when u wake up in the morning sick and ""need"" to find a way to cop and get well. I just wanted to get high. I was cocky, I thought I could do the dope, that I could control it. It took less than two weeks until the dope was doing me. It took just a little bit longer than that for the dope to control me again. If I had just never relapsed after having the baby, I would have such a beautiful life with a family and home of my own.  I think about that constantly. My addiction spiralled out of control so quickly after that relapse, racking up a list criminal charges in less than a year that most addicts would take at least a decade to catch, overdoses, medical issues most people don't even know about, ruined relationships with anyone who didn't get high,  ruining my credit with cavalier attitude as i fell thousands and thousands of dollars into debt, and so many other consequences that rained down on me after that relapse that I had never experienced before in my early. Most of all, I  have left my beautiful, smart, sweet, perfect little girl without a mother for the past year. Thank goodness she has her father. I got pregnant the first night i met him,  embarrassingly enough, our birth control failed unbeknownst at the time and neither one of us had considered abortion. Despite being a teenager still and not knowing me at all, when I told him i was pregnant, he was Sooo happy and excited..he got down on one knee and asked me to marry him right there lol. He settled for being my official boyfriend though. He's a sweet, loving, patient, funny, attentive guy who stepped up to the plate without hesitation. I've never met a better father, and i swear to god i mean that. Not surprisingly, I ruined that relationship with my relapse, although he didn't know that was the reason. Despite being broken up, he still let me live in his house, drive his car, paid for everything i wanted and needed for close to 10 months, asking for nothing at all in return. His discovery of my relapse marked my true arrival at rock bottom. The disappointment in his eyes.. I couldnt bring myself to admit i had been using for months before he caught me. He thought it was only 2 weeks for some reason, so I played along. He forced me to move in with my parents, though he graciously allowed me to keep custody of my daughter monday-friday because I was in IOP, on probation, and because at that point, I was still ""an amazing mom that puts her kid first"" and it would ""break baby's heart to be without her mama"". But my addiction was worse than ever, getting myself into extreme debt, credit card and otherwise, to make money after taking my daughter to the babysitter every morning. I was going to cop and get high with people, coming down, then picking her up and going home to parents house. I should have been at IOP and going to meetings and job searching but in reality, I was quickly got kicked out of IOP for pissing dirty. So basically, I was just using that as an excuse for my parents to pay for childcare while i ran wild, a truth that I am very ashamed of, but I was out of control at this point, so lying to my parents about my whereabouts was nothing to me. I wouldn't put my daughter in danger, so having a safe place for her while i was out putting myself in danger was paramount to my continued self destruction. One time, i got some bad bags and didnt do a test shot so I ended up overdosing, a full on not breathing, blue lips, OD. My friend hit me with narcan that she had, thank god, and I woke up still nodding and high as duck.  She watched me for the rest of the day until it was time to pick up my daughter. I was still high so my friend dropped me off at the babysitter (family friend) where i called my mom and claimed to have locked my keys in the car and needed picked up. I'll admit, I thought about just driving myself to pick her up and driving her home to avoid getting caught.. I couldnt do it though. I've always made sure she was safe. I won't say I've put her first, that's a lie. I put heroin and myself first. But when everything came crashing down, I got caught up in my lies, my parents stopped paying for a sitter, and I was faced with the prospect of continuing to lie, keeping my daughter, and continuing in my addiction...i made the hardest choice EVER. I was marked as ""deadbeat, junkie mom"" and fuck i think that might be true.. But I let my web of lies crash all the way down, confessed to everything, admitted i planned on using still, and cried harder than i ever have as i literally passed my baby off to her dad to take her from me as i got kicked out of my parents house. God i lied so much, telling the truth felt so Good. But it hurt so bad to let everyone, especially my little girl, down and tell them through my actions that dope is more important to me than they are. I fucked up everything Good in my life. I hurt everyone i love, over and over again. I missed out on so many opportunities. I lost so much time that I'll never get back. People who claim to live life with ""no regrets"" are obviously not addicts because most of the past few years are just a long regret smh. U know how I started using drugs? I was a straight A college student with a job, car, apartment, ""popular"" with a football star boyfriend, tons of friends... I had a migraine so I skipped my morning class one day. I went to the laundry room of the duplex i rented half of to find the tenants of the other half, looking zonked out doing laundry together. We started talking and I mentioned my migraine and they mentioned a ""sure cure"" they had, all it cost me was a couple cigarettes. It was a bag of heroin. I had never even drank or smoked weed, cigarettes were the worst thing id tried at age 19. I liked it that way,  but I was bored of my life admittedly. Come to think of it, most of my relapses happened initially because of boredom. Huh. So anyway, I said fuck it and dumped out the bag to sniff like i had seen in movies. ""nah its a waste to sniff, let me hit u"" said my new ""friend"", what a scum bag. So I let him shoot me up and that was it, I knew i needed more drugs forever. I finally felt comfortable in my own skin and confident, not like i was just some fuckin loser putting on the biggest performance of the year, constantly afraid i would fuck up, let the people around me into my head, revealing that I'm just a fat, ugly, weird, boring, annoying, jealous, poser with no good qualities and no real happiness. Since the day i tried that first bag, ""Fuck it"" has my motto basically. Anyway. The point of this post is that in that I'm gonna try to get clean again. Since I'm gonna be in the hospital til mid may, all i gotta do to cut my supply off is tell my boyfriend i wanna quit. He's gonna be so happy that he cries. Just like he cried last time i relapsed. He cries alot lol, I tease him about that but the truth is, I'm jealous as fuck at his ability to feel emotion like that because I can't anymore. It makes me wonder if it's because of the drugs numbing that part of my brain or because I'm just a budding sociopath. They're giving me methadone in here, that should help i guess. And I can finally go outside to smoke a couple times a day, that will help astronomically. I have unlimited access to therapists (students in the psych department always need more hours to log with patients) and since I have a fucked up childhood full of rape, physical abuse, mental abuse, confusion, and fear.. Enough fucked up shit to make all the law and order svu episodes and lifetime movies combined look like Sesame Street, I guess I'll take advantage of that by trying to talk to someone everyday. I'll start playing the fun game i used to play with therapists who looked like fresh meat,  ""how many true stories about my past does it take until i make the therapist refer me to someone else who can handle my issues better"" lol usually doesn't take long. Anyone interested in hearing about my childhood trauma? I've been thinking it might be therapeutic to write about it, however terrible my sober writing may be so I might post that tonight if there's any interest. I might seem like I don't care, it's a joke,  or whatever but that's a defense mechanism. On some real, my childhood was so fucked up that there are memories I've never shared with another soul because I can't bring myself to say to words out loud. But since y'all are reading this so I don't have to speak the words, and no one knows me on here irl..im thinking this is my opportunity to get things off my chest. I don't wanna trigger anyone to remember their own traumatic past, but maybe someone will read it and know they aren't alone and they don't have to suffer in silence. Having the courage to speak out takes away the power from our abusers or the things that haunt us. Or maybe it will just satisfy a morbid curiosity for someone. Idc, I just am tired of telling my addiction story without getting to tell the story of what happened before that made me into the person who became an addict.

Thanks Narcan (but also fuck Narcan, am I right)","I've always been a ""chipper"" and thought that I was invincible. Needless to say I've been disavowed of that notion.

Last thing I remember is snorting two big bumps before going to bed. Just wanted to sleep without anxiety. I had a crappy weekend - I was dumped by a guy I really liked - and thought I'd just treat myself to my favorite crutch. I hadn't eaten in three days, just sniffed dope and thrown up stomach bile, over and over again.

Next thing I knew cops and paramedics were surrounding me, yelling at me, asking me what I took. I wanted to tell them and have them stop yelling but I couldn't get my brain and mouth to move in tandem. I had been spending the night at my ex boyfriend's house, someone who's never even so much as smoked weed before. He woke up when he heard my rattling breathing and saw that I was turning blue. Poor thing thought I was having an asthma attack...luckily the cops and EMTs knew better. I'm ten minutes from Camden, NJ - they see this every day.

Stuffed in an ambulance and all I remember is being so cold, looking down at my hands. The ER nurse and doctor were the sweetest people I've ever met, didn't judge me at all, just wanted to do everything they could to make it feel better. I'm crying just thinking of how kind they were.

Tox screen came back negative for opiates. So it was synthetic. Fentanyl. Figures. Out of all my years of being ""careful"" and only insufflating, I'm finally felled by the mighty fent.

When I came home the damn stupid cops hadn't even found my bag, it was still sitting in my purse. So I had my ex bf flush it right there in front of me. Hours later, in pain and withdrawal, I wish he hadn't. Which is how I know I made the right decision, I guess.

Fuck. Dunno what to do from here. I have work tomorrow. I haven't told my parents get. My sternum is all fucked up. I just want that sweet dreamless sleep I was after in the beginning.",1459804310.0

I'm back with a very SERIOUS issue (Sorry, very long and rambling. My bad.)","Remember me? I was here the other day asking about getting clean needles. Well, the needles were *mainly* for an associate of mine. I finally got a box of 100 from Walmart I kept nine; I gave him ninety-one. The reason I did this for him was because he is absolutely handicapped with social awkwardness, and I am only slightly socially awkward. I can function in society, where he can not. Also, he doesn't know much about technology (or much of anything that does not involve a tourniquet and a needle), and Reddit confuses the hell out of him. However, I am a veteran Redditor, although I *DID* want to make a Throwaway for that question because I did not want that type of shit to be associated with my main account. I wanted to basically do a bit of work so that about once per month, I could get like 10 few sharps, because that's all I would end up using anyway. Anyway, someone mentioned Wal-Mart, after entirely too much goddamn time searching for needles in bulk. Thank you stranger, because Wal-Mart worked out well. Ten our fifteen minutes after walking into the one on H St. (harhar) I left with a box of 100 new, clean 31g syringes, and all I had to do was sign a sheet of paper, using a false name. Lady was cool as she could be and didn't even ask for is, although the lady *may have* seen my Govt. ID but I really couldn't give a fuck less either way. Also, biggups to her for not giving me the fucked up attitude that I had experienced at (or when calling) CVS, Rite-Aid, AND Walgreens. Fuck all *those* chain pharmacies, Wal-Mart is the real deal, and please believe that is something that I never thought I would say. 

I wasn't going to bullshit anyone and say that I was Diabetic, because I have fucking integrity, and a large part  of that is honesty. I was straight up about what I needed and why I needed them, and I got nothing but attitude from at least 25 places. I should have gone to WM sooner, but I digress. 

I don't remember the person's handle exactly who recommended Wal-Mart, but thank you to whomever it was. Also, thanks to u/traintomars, who recommended a very specific spot where she apparently gets them, but I unfortunately had no luck at. She was so fucking cool that she even offered to, if I didn't get sorted at that place she recommended, to give me a one or two of hers. However, I did not accept the kind gesture, as I look kind of intimidating, but am totally a fucking teddy bear. Back home (a major city in Georgia, but no, not Atlanta) I somehow even got the moniker Fluffy Bunny. Don't ask, because I don't know.

I don't judge our have anyfuckingthing against anyone who injects junk into their veins, I don't personally do it, but that has something to do with the fact that I am already on Dilaudid as needed for breakthrough pain, Opana for 24 hour relief, OR Duragesic (Fentanyl) for 72 hour relief, however NEVER Opana AND Duragesic at the same time, as I wholeheartedly believe that that would kill me. 

*It's just that I use my *real* Reddit account to promote my photography money making....thing, my music production/engineering/mastering LLC, my (inert!) blotter paoer jewelry line, and last (and fucking definitely least) my forty hour per week soul sucking Govt. Contracting job. Anyway, I'm rambling again, sorry about that.*

I knew that if there were any online community that could help me find the answer to that question for dude, it would be r/opiates. So, he dictated shit to me, and I typed it out. I'm not actually sure why he asked me to say that he's from Australia, because he's fucking not. Anyway, I helped him out and got a few sharps for myself because while I do not shoot and sort of opiate, I admittedly *DO* shoot Coke once in a while as it is sometimes the only way I can get through my job, where I feel like a prisoner of doom. Also, about once oer week, ketamine. And I'm a bit ashamed to admit it, but I do also shoot CM much less often, for funsies.

Anyway, now that the air is clear and you all know all that stupid shit about me (But fucking yay for TOR, VPN's, Virtual Machines, and basically being a Government Trained expert on security and anonymity) let me get to my question. 

I REALLY do not discriminate when it comes to who I hang out with. I am none of the following, but I hang out with a laundry list of stereotypes and sub-cultures, including but *certainly* not limited to: 

Ravers, Candy Kids, Junglists, Punks (fuck the Skinhead shit though, those scum can die), Crustheads, Metalheads, Cybergoths, Gangsters, even Wanksters, Industrial/Death Metal Fans (Fun Fact! I've seen Cryptopsy and Fear Factory BOTH 23 times, twice together,  three times more than any other bands.) Nerds, Hippes, Etc. Ad Infinitum. 

While I wasn't getting all sorts of fucked in high school, I was winning State and once a National High School Chess tournament. In elementary, before my two shoulder Devils met and Diabolical and Malevolent became best friends, I was winning state Spelling Bees Sadly, never won a National one though. Anyway, as my archetypal list of friends should tell you, I am an extremely well rounded person.

I went on another tangent, however. That's what happens when you have all the time in the world, and your Dr. is an hour late to see you. Sorry, for real this time, I swear.

Ok, to the point, fucking finally. So,I was hanging out with an anonymous buddy of mine yesterday. I will go ahead and say that his name is John, because it's not like that name is fucking Bocephus or anything. John is a name which can be anonymous, sort of like mine, which is James. Anyway, John admittedly was being a goddamn idiot, and taking huge bumps of alpha-methyltryptamine, which BY ITSELF is a goddamned Monster of a Tryptamine, MDMA which is to a large degree potentiated by the aMT, and to top it all off, his own fucking creation (to my knowledge), bk-Fentanyl, an analogue which, by his own measure was about 5 times more powerful than Fentanyl itself. 

Yeah, I do drugs, I'm not going to bullshit about this. However, I also happen to know A LOT about the body and its various systems, and a bit about how drugs interact with each other, which is how I'm still alive, really. Mixing aMT and MDMA (I do not like either) is a big no no due to the massive risk of overheating, by themselves. However bringing bk-Fent into the situation was basically asking for multi irgan failure. I told him this, he ignored me. So, he volumetrically dosed himself with the bk-Fent, took 210 or 220mg of MDMA, and topped it off with a non measured dose of aMT. I told him quite a few times that this was a very bad idea, but he did not listen. Within about 30 minutes of taking the concoction he was unconscious, with a VERY high, but unmeasurable fever, due to not keeping a thermometer on hand. Before he even hit the ground though, I pulled his phone out and and was dialing 911 almost as soon as he hit the floor. I told the woman who answered the phone all that my friend had taken, and our exact location, and hung up. I knew that I only had maybe a few minutes at most, so I took all those chemicals, tossed the aMT and MDMA because fuck those chemicals and came home with the bk-Fent, told a lab tech that it was unidentifiable material, at least to me. I then asked her to purify and  wash the sample a few times, and to run tests on it to identify the exact structure, including a gc/ms,and whatever else was needed. She came back around lunch time and told me that during the tests, she had destroyed about 2mg of it, but that the tests revealed that it was 99.9 Fentanyl. 

So, I'm thinking maybe I could wash the other 4 to 5 grams, have her run the exact same test on a few samples, and voila, I have a few grams of lab grade Fentanyl. Here is where the question comes in. Is there ANY street value for pure Fent? I know dope Boys love it, because it can give their H a kick into overdrive. However, I dont want to do this, due to my prediction that it will probably increase overdose by a large margin, and I'm all about safety.

Any help is appreciated much! I have to get rid of this, but if I can make a few bucks, why not. I know I can sell it for a good amount on the Darknet, but as I said,I don't really want dope dealers getting their hands on it because this shit WILL KILL people, AND there is a ridiculously large amount of it. Plz help! Ant STREET value at all, to end users?

Edit3: RIP Inbox, John is going to be okay. And no, I do not have this, or anything else illegal at home. Everything even questionable is at work, in a safe box, behind a five foot thick door that closes at night.

I have a couple subs in my wallet right now but I really want to get my tolerance back down, and subs certainly aren't the way to do it unless I drop my sub usage down to very tiny amounts per day.

A lot of claims that /r/drugs is way too critical of opiates and that opiates are *not* the devil, just another drug, and there are healthy ways to use them recreationally.

2) Posts both here and on /r/drugs saying that if you try to use semi-regularly, you will almost surely get addicted.

Quick edit after posting: I can't change the title but I just want to clarify that I know, of course, it's all relative.

It's a mix of nausea, sometimes dizziness, cloudy head, and generally feeling like crap. I can usually sleep this off but it's on work nights (usually Sunday) where the next day is crap. The high is defs not worth it I find it very mediocre, but I guess  boredom and wanting to have a chill night brings me back. My tolerance is really low still 30mg, and I take oxyneos with the coating dissolved.

So my question is, do oxys make anyone else sick the next day (not craving more, just sick) and what do you do about it? Could it be the extended release coating causing it?",1459915285.0

4dk5e5,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/4dk5e5/playing_my_ex_girlfriend/,37,https://redd.it/4dk5e5,HYBRID98,Playing my ex girlfriend.,"Here's what's happening. Me and my ex broke up feb 3rd, and she's gone very downhill. Every time I have talked to her, she's fucked a new guy, the last guy she fucked cheated on his girlfriend to do so. She's been with 5 different guys since we broke up, we were both our first everything. She's also developed an adderal habit. A bad one. Bad enough to where everyone cut her off and she has 10 left to last her until she can find more.

So here's what I'm doing and why.

Saturday she called my new girlfriend a replacement, said she hoped I get into cutting again, hopes I relapse (3.5 years clean..long story)  hope me and new girlfriend (her name is Morgan) don't work out and I drive her away, also how much she hates me and what not etc, there's a lot more. so she asked me to get a hold of adderal for her today, and I unblocked her, and told her I could, said I paid in advance for them because he gets his script on the 16th. So I told her if she wrote me and Morgan BOTH a full page, whole hearted apology, I would do it. So tomorrow she's giving me 20$, and 4 notes (two that ""weren't good enough"" and two that will suffice) and 20$. I'm taking her 20$, I'm taking her notes, then I intend to block her, and never breathe in her direction again. 

Here's the thing. I didn't pay in advance. I don't plan on getting them for her. She's going to give me 20$ and 4 notes and she's not getting shit, then giving 20$ to new girlfriend who is in on it, to spend on whatever her heart desires. Fuck my ex girlfriend. She probably hit her head one too many times on her fuckbuddys headboard and lost all her sense.

Any tips?,"Last summer you guys helped me detox from morphine and embarrassingly enough, less than a year later, I find myself going through the process yet again.

This time with ambien.

A bit of background, I have a genetic disease which causes chronic pain, so finding the right kind and dose of pain medication with my doctors has been a bit of nightmare but after being rotated between fenty, morphine, oxy and benzos I've found vicodin is the one thing that doesn't have horrible side effects so my doc has me on a daily script. 

My disease makes it very difficult to sleep as well and I was put on sleeping meds for the first time this year and at first sleeping was worth it-it was a dream to sleep a full 7 hours for the first time in my life but the depression and mood swings and exhaustion have not become worth it anymore and I don't want to tell my doctor about the side effects, as I am afraid she'll be hesitant to keep up my vicodin script-which I need to make most of my days functional.

I was put on ambien 5mg a night and for reference I am 5'3 1/2"", 26yr female and weigh 103lbs.

When I was put on Morphine for 5 weeks last summer and took myself off of it, I home detoxed for 2 weeks but it was about a month until all the symptoms of WD were completely gone. 

And having a chronic pain problem will make WD worse, from what I've read, in particular with Ambien WD.

So I have 30 5mg tablets of valium for muscle pain and to prevent seizing and my vicodin but am trying to take only as much as I need so I don't have to prolong WD. I was planning on getting some valerian root too. I am also on 40mg of adderall a day and have been debating if I should keep taking it right now but think most likely I should, even if that prolongs the sleep depravation so my system doesn't get too stressed out. 

I have stocked up on fresh fruit, magnesium supplements, water with electrolytes, sprite for nausea and my husband is taking excellent care of me but 31 hours in,, this is already hell. 

My body feels like a bat was taken to it in away that feels even worse than the Morphine WD, headaches raging, on and off nausea, complete exhaustion, panic attacks and sleep deprevation of course. 



I am wondering what tips you guys might have? Supplement recommendations or any others.

Do you think detoxing cold turkey is best, IYE? or cutting down on your dose each/every other night? What do you think about using benzos in WD? Does it prolong WD in your experience? 

Thank you!",1459908651.0

The following is the account of the abuse i experienced between the ages of 5-18,"What I'm writing is completely true, as i remember it, with the exception of any identifying information which is changed to protect me and my loved ones from being named. I'm not gonna lie though, I would actually be dumb excited if someone figured everything out some how and reported every bad guy who ever hurt me ..I say it like that because the only source i had access too was my memory back. And sometimes our memories paint a different picture than the one that as that was really there. I'm pretty close to 100% sure that my memories from my teenage years are being told totally accurately in terms of facts, the feelings surrounded those facts are a different story so I'm going to just stick to facts at first. 
Ok let's start back in the beginning, 1997 or 98, and I was in kindergarten when I lost my childhood innocence. My mom left us with babysitters maybe once a week.  They were almost all high school students, beautiful, fun, sporty females. But one babysitter was different. He was in high school, brothers with my cousins best friend, came from a prominent and widely known church family. He was the first dude i ever gave head to. I hated the taste, I cried and begged him to stop at first but would get so rough with me.. I got it to stop one day after he had just started to get extra forceful and scary with the way he made me choke, his laughing hysterically and maniacally at me as i was gagging and crying made me feel something very strong.. It was like anger/fear/hate all in one.  But whatever it was worked because it made me bite down on his sick so hard that it was bleeding. The last thing i remember about him was him calling what was presumably a buddy of his on my house phone and talking about some dumb bitch who bit him, asking for as ride to the er, and his back as he jumped in his buddy's car and left me and my siblings, James age 21 and Katie age 20 now, home alone for hours til my mom returned to find us a alone and declare we would never have as another boy babysitting us! I think he had sex with my little sister but I don't know and I dont wanna ask her. I vaguely remember walking in on him putting his penis inside my little baby 2 year old sister, memories can fail us though so take that with a grain of salt. I've never told another living soul about that.. It feels very therapeutic and my burden feels lighter but I'm also feeling the pain of remembering. 
Next is the weekly molestation that I endured by a church teacher from ages 8 to 11. I was tall, skinny, and had just started to develop the tiniest little boobs.. I remember looking in the mirror and being so excited to get boobs! Other people noticed too.  I felt grown men start to leer, teenage boys too young for sex and relationships but too old for girls my age were starting to flirt and playfully touch me. I liked flirting with the boys a couple years older than me but it seemed like i got soooo much more attention from older, like wayyyy too old dudes. I guess one of those dudes Just could not control himself but Mr.  Adams had 3 girls of his own all around my age and he almost always taught Sunday church school class. He was so lecherous that I still can't believe he got away with rubbing us, breathing super close to our neck and ears, escalating to requiring girl to kiss him if they got in trouble, taking girls into the art closet for ""special time"", taking snapshots of us as we played. I guess he liked NY boobs because he made sure that we played together every week. He had a super specific smell and I still don't know what it is, but I almost throw up usually. He was the most innocent of my abusers, if that makes any sense. In hindsight, the way he behaved as he touched me was like a giddy, nervous excitement. During our ""play times"", he just seemed like one of us and like i was fooling around with another kid. I actually kinda liked it towards the end. Do u think he was acting like that on purpose to gain my trust to where i didn't tell as anyone about his behavior because A. We liked him and wanted to keep playing 
B. He made us feel and believe that he was one of us, therefore it didn't feel wrong that he was hooking up with students
One day, he didn't come to class and we heard thru the grapevine he was working at home depot and lost his credibility and his teaching license that allowed him to work his day job as a high school teacher.
I have had two different experiences with sexual abuse during my preteen/childhood years. It was the one in 8th grade that impacted me in the hardest way out of ANY single thing i have ever experienced in my life. I wanna get back to some sort of chronological order though so let me recount the psychological torture that I endured in the red brick house on oakmont drive with the tan siding and Forrest green trim. I never felt anything like the pain that my parents had enflicted upon me and my brother. As for my little sister? My parents never have laid a finger on her, as far as i know. Im torn between being soooo thankful she didn't have to go through that. But I wouldn't be telling the truth if I said i  never wondered what would have happened if I was the special one that didn't get whooped. Mama's favorite, daddy's girl. 
My brother just recently started his own decent Ivy the twilight zone that is heroin addiction, where the your life stays the same but u look uglier with time. He partied alot, especially drinking, for several years before he tried dope.  But he's shooting already, has overdosd several times since Christmas, he doesn't even know the first thing as but harm reduction. I don't get high with him and I've been cutting down on my communication with him because I'm basically scared to watch him kill himself. But I digress.
I look back on some of the things my parents did to us and I wonder how I can tell my mom that I love her and mean it while she tells me that she loves me too and I believe it. They would make us sleep on the ice cold cement floor of the basement closet in winter naked if we did something like sneak a snack, fib about if we brushed our teeth, or if I didn't throw up all of my dinner. Everyday and everynight my mom would tell me I was fat, chubby, porky, ugly, gross, repulsive, and the biggest mistake she ever made. I had a major problem in my teen years with eating disorders, or ""diets"" as my mom affectionately called them. My prom diet was a month 3 v8 juices and some fruit 3 times a day. Then once a week anything i wanted as much as i could eat McDonald's. But I had to throw it all up within 5 min or i would be punished. Other punishments were being forced to sleep outside in the cold rain with Just as T-shirt on. But they stopped that after a particularly cold rain due to wind.. I was so malnourished and freezing that I almost died and I needed the hospital. So my mom took me as fast as she could, crying tears that I don't know if they were real or fake. The doctors saw me and immediately circled in on my mom,  surely they were about to save me right?  Wrong. My mom labelled me as a troubled girl plagued by eating disorders, more severe mental health illness, and a rebellious streak that ended in alot of runaway situations, and this one ended with a cold,  sick skeleton passing out in the yard during a great escape, only to be found by my loving mother in the morning, oh my baby. As she sobbed, even i almost felt bad for her. 
As we got older, the beatings my dad would give us become less frequent and less intense. He used a belt often.  He was very religious so he was a big fan of the switch beatings. Nothing quite like getting ur own switch for a beating. I think he slowed down most drastically because we stopped reacting when we were about 14/15. One day though, my brother kg as laughed at my dad after he had just landed a punch, causing my dad to snap go haul off on my brother. The weird part happened next.. My brother started to fight back. I watched, dumbfounded, as my little brother kicked our dads ass. He wasn't so little actually anymore, when did that happen? Whenever, however, whatever, I dont care because my dad never touch us again. They still used the punishments like the Floor and wacking our knuckles with rulers like the nuns did to him. Greatly reduced, the abuse continued until i graduated high school at 18. Now, if I bring up those time to her in an effort to get closure, she denies they ever did. And I'll be damned if she doesn't have me convinced for a moment before I flash back to her yanking my hair so she can put her fingers down my throat at exactly the right angle so I barf. 
The act of abuse that has hurt me the most is the one that was let perpetrated by the principal of my middle school in 8th grade.  He has called me to his office under the pretense if discussing my potential suspension as punishment for allegedly participating in a food fight.  I began to recite the speech about my guilt, how I wanted to make up for it, how I needed to fix what i had done for punishment. In the middle of my last bullet point of an idea, started to kiss my neck and ears getting them coated in slobber and turning me off beyond belief. He started peeling my clothes from my body as tears rolled down my cheeks, and I feared that i was going to commit a sin with him any minute. I shook and shivered while the tears kept coming, he yanked off my pants, yanked off his and shoved himself inside me, dry and forceful. His hand had already moved to my mouth like he knew i would scream, but he stifled it almost completely. I didn't make anymore noise. He finished quickly thank god... He told me that I had the tightest pussycat he had ever felt. I threw up in the bathroom afterwards. As i left the bathroom, counting about 5 min since he came and went.. I nearly bump into my mom as she arrives for a meeting about suspending me. Her mom instinct picks something up,  some how she knows something is very wrong and we leave immediately after she gives some excuse about my period to the secretary. We get in her car.  She demands that I tell her whats wrong guess several things until she lands on the truth, so I confess. I expect sympathy, love,  and for him to go away in handcuffs. But he's not the only bad guy. My mom is one too. So I wasn't surprised at all when she told me never to tell anyone, she wanted to avoid a media circus, she wanted to protect me from being known for nothing other than being raped.  So from the that moment on, it was our little secret. She never reported it, neither did i. If u bring it up to her today though, she denies that it ever happened.
I swear on my daughters soul that these words are truth as i remember. I wish they weren't because then maybe i would be normal, I would be alright,  I would be whole. My biggest goal in life is to be sure that my daughter never has to feel the same pain i did. 
The heroin numbs me. It doesn't make me forget my trauma, not even close.  But it makes me not give as fuck that it happened, and that's just as good.",1459905947.0

4dj6gm,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/4dj6gm/my_first_love/,13,https://redd.it/4dj6gm,Dopana,My first love,"A**** was my first love. For 4-5 years we dated on and off. She left when she turned 25 as part of some mid-life crisis, and heroin was there to catch me when I fell. Today, I'm talking to someone else but have come back into contact with A****. She says she doesn't wanna date again, but I've heard that before and can't tell if there's a future with us or not.

It's so interesting to see the parallels between my two true loves: A**** and heroin.

Heroin and I have been seeing each other on and off for about 3 years. I'm so excited to see her and while she may not be the best influence, my day feels empty without her.

Texting A**** gives me this sense of satisfaction and emptiness at the same time. Talking to her in itself brings me great pain and sorrow, but at the time it feels worth it just to have that fleeting sensation of hope fill my body .. Hope that we'll get back together, and that life isn't all about suffering.

It pains me like nothing else to see pictures of A**** and I, especially ones of us together, but they're still here in my phone (just like my plugs' phone numbers) because I can't bear to imagine the thought of never seeing those pictures again.

A**** texted me today. She told me how badly she missed how I used to play around with her and the good times we used to have. I texted her back earlier and received no response, but it's okay because heroin is here to make it all better, even if just for a few moments.

Every bag I pour out carries with it shame and pride, intertwined like a vanilla swirl. I feel great just a few moments after it draws up my nose, but imagine the cost that comes with it: lies, broken relationships, money.

At the end of the day, I always find the need to feel the warm embrace of A**** or heroin, although heroin has been much more consistent. It was getting back with A**** that saved me from heroin, and losing A**** that brought me back into her arms .. Through it all, heroin has always been able to dry my tears, as long as I have time and money for our dates.

Tonight, I contemplate texting A**** again, or perhaps seeing the girl I'm talking to. However, no matter how many times I try to grow the same feelings for this new girl as I've had for A****, it just never comes out the same. I've even told her ""I love you"" in a woeful attempt to switch my dependence, but in the end it's a lie to her and a lie to myself.

I know what true love is. My heart has A**** , while my veins have heroin. There's times I wish I never met either, but times I reflect on how I wouldn't trade the euphoria I experienced from either for anything in the world. I hope A**** texts me back, and maybe I can leave heroin again, but heroin and I are hanging out tonight and either way, everything will be alright.",1459899651.0

I normally post in this sub but this is a throwaway cos I don't want this coming back to me for obvious reasons. 

This happened about 10 years ago now, back when I was very na√Øve and fuelled by constant stimulants. I had a new pickup recommended to me that I'd been putting off meeting cos, well, I was on a pretty good thing at the time. Anyway you know the story, normal Dboy isn't picking up / out of town so I decided to give this new number a call. Lets call him Sam. So I called Sam up and his mrs answers (who gave me the number in the first place) and was excited to hear from me and just told me to come round, I asked to speak to Sam first because I wanted to make sure he had enough before I made the hour trip out there. He gets on and says ""no worries, just come round, my place is a bit hard to find, so meet me under this bridge in about an hour and I'll come get you and take you to mine. "" So I head off, now I'd never met the guy before, but he sounded about my age, young, bubbly. And I was told what car to look out for, but through all of the benzos I just remembered ""red."" I should mention that I'd been awake for about 3 days at this point, which was the style at the time, so I knew I wasn't quite right in my head, but that sorta time in the bender is where the gold happens :) 

So I get to said bridge, park my car and get out to have a smoke and send him a text to say that I was waiting. Not a minute later a car drives past, slows down, then pulls over about 15m in front of me. ""Sweet, this guy is actually punctual too!"" I thought, so I walk over and just open the passenger door and jump in. ""Hey man, I'm ____"" and shake his hand, first thing I realize is ""this guy looks a lot older than he sounded on the phone. Looks older too, about 45-50. Then he just looks at me. 

We sit for about 10 seconds, a really long silence. I hadn't met the guy before, so trying not to incriminate myself for whatever reason I said ""So are you the guy that's supposed to be taking me to this party? My car died and I rang my mate and he said he'd send someone to grab me, are you him?"" The guy just looks at me for a second and says ""If that's what you want.."" and then waits for me to respond. We're both sitting in silence, starting to get uncomfortable now. Then I shift my gaze to the front of the car to break eye contact just long enough for me to realize in my sleep deprived delirium that his car is white. Not the red car I was supposed to wait for. So running through my head is ""Fuck, I've just got in some randoms car. Fuck. What if hes a fucking cop!? Its OK, I haven't said anything about drugs yet. So I just open the door and jump out and say ""hang on I forgot my smokes"" and walk back to my car. 

I get in and sit and try to think how to get out of this situation, and the guy opens his door and gets out and starts walking towards mine. He gets to the window and says ""yeah, I'll take you to this party, winks at me, then lights a smoke"" I just panicked. I started the car and said ""Oh hey look, it works now! All good, I got this"" And pulled out to drive off. I look in my mirror and he was running to his car, Then his headlights are on and he's tailing me, about 100m behind at this stage. I 'm freaking out as I have to stop at a red light, He pulls up behind me, and I just pull a U turn at the red (It was about 2am, so no traffic anyway) and just floor it in the other direction, I quickly turned up a side street, and zigzagged for 2 minutes through back streets, then pulled into some business block driveway and just turned the car off and hid under the dash for what felt like half an hour. I saw him drive past twice in that time, so I knew he was looking for me, but by this point I was fairly sure he wasn't a cop, this was just some fucking weirdo. I called Sam up and said, ""change of plans, you gotta just come and get me. He picked up the fear in my voice so just agreed, and I gave him a new spot to meet. I made a break for it, and luckily when I got there, a red car was waiting for me. I went to the drivers side window and said Sam?? to make sure it was the right guy this time, thankfully it was. 

Anyway back at his place I told him the whole story and him and his mrs just pissed themselves laughing. Apparently the bridge they told me to stop under runs adjacent to a park that is the most notorious gay beat in the city. And I got in this dudes car, and asked him if he was going to ""take me to this party""

In hindsight it was pretty funny, and he had mad stock on him so I bought up big, we spent the night getting mashed, and I kept my anal virginity in tact. Good times. ",1459895093.0

And on that note. Looks like I didn't make the greatest decision with meds, yay me! 

Have a great night all! 


Hello all,

I hope someone could help me understand a couple things a little better. Yes I googled but you guys are very knowledgeable and have always given me good advice in the past.

Anyway, how does oxycodone 10mg compare to dilaudid 4mg as far as strength goes both being taken orally? 

I think I remember reading that oxycodone has an oral bioavailability of 90 something %. How is the oral bioavailability of dilaudid? If I'm wrong with that please correct me.  If there is anything else that you think may be useful for me to know that I didn't ask, please feel free to tell me. 

Thank you in advance to anyone willing to help and comment on this post. Hope you all are having a great day. Be safe.üòé",1459891140.0

4dhvdy,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/4dhvdy/almost_got_pinched/,53,https://redd.it/4dhvdy,druggie_throw_away,Almost got pinched,"So, I got lazy last night and decided against driving an hour to Detroit to p/u. I figured I would be fine today at work since I took my last dose after work. Boy was I wrong. I had ran to Detroit the night before and didn't want to make the hour haul there and back again... Plus I knew if I had dope in my hands I would do more of it when I didn't really need it, then I would be struggling to find more money today.

I just took a tram and it's starting to kick in and I'm starting to feel a tad bit better but I decided that since I'm going to get next to nothing done at work I would share a story of when I almost got pinched the other day picking up dope. 

So, I owed my dboy money and I scrounged around to get about $40 to get something to tide me over but I didn't want to go through my dboy since I knew he would want to be paid back (or so I thought). I called up my friend who I used to drive into Detroit when he didn't have his license and he said sure, he would help me out. My ex and I load up in the car and head up to my friends house. As soon as he is in the car we are on our way to Joy road. I don't know if anyone else has heard of Joy road but you never hear good stories. Now this isn't where I got my dope from and I'm not going to tell you exactly where because that's a major no, no. Anyway, I was already sketched out because I'm used to going to my dboy only and his area is pretty low key and safe. 

My friend calls his connect on the way and he gives us a intersection to be at. We go there and we sit. After ten minutes I'm starting to freak out because we NEVER sit that long and the longer you sit the more suspicious you look. After about fifteen minutes my friend asks me to unlock my car because my car likes to lock people in. He jumps out and hides his syringe in a cup that is sitting by the road. This is sign number three that things arn't going as planned. I should have just said fuck it and left but I was withdrawing and I had already wasted so much time I just wanted to get it and go. 

So, the dude finally pulls up and we pass it through the window and the first intersection I come up to I look to the left and lo and behold there is an undercover cop speeding up in a black impala.

I look back at my friend and he was like ""Fucking FLOOR IT!"". I take off and I've never ran from the cops before and he's in the back seat screaming at me to keep going and not to stop at stop signs to just blow them. I'm thinking I don't want to blow a stop sign and get a marked police car after me too so I'm trying to floor it but be safe as well and come to a semi rolling stop before I speed off. We're going left and right trying to lose this unmarked car and we finally get the the main road and I see a small service drive behind Coney Island. I ask my friend if I should squeeze back there and hide and he says yes. 

I squeeze back there and my ex goes ""what car are you even talking about,"" like he was completely fucking oblivious to everything that just transpired. He then goes ""was it the whitish taurus that kept circling?"" and I said ""No, it was a black undercover impala."" and then I shit you not he goes ""oh, like the one that is behind us.""

I seriously almost shit my pants. I look back and sure as shit the undercover is down the road that we are on and slamming on his breaks. I didn't even think, I floored it. I went left and right and left and some how managed to get to the highway. My friend told me to just floor it and weave in and out of traffic so we get mixed in the shuffle and that's exactly what we did. 

When I first got off on the highway I saw him speeding up and getting on the highway and well. My heart was in my throat. Right then my life flashed before my eyes. There goes my good job because they sure as hell arn't going to keep a heroin addict like me on their bill. There goes my family when they find out what I'm up too. There goes my car when I get pulled over for possession. I was almost in tears. I was flying almost 110 down the highway hoping to god I didn't pass another cop and wondering why we didn't get caught. My friend said it was lucky and that the undercover was probably kicking himself for not having his light on him. 

So that's my story and it should have scared me enough to go straight and it didn't because that's the depressing life of a junkie. 

Anyone have a similar story/stories?",1459882186.0

For example, imagine theoretically I was clean from IV heroin for a 40 days, relapsed and did it two days in a row which sent men into be withdrawals (not sure why this happens as u become more experienced with opiates, when I was starting if I did opiates much more often and get much higher without withdrawals, although that's a question for another time, feel free to answer it here though lol). Anyway i goes into withdrawals after two days of using, bad withdrawal too, so I buy two suboxone 8mg, splitting the first in fourths and the second in into 2 fourths and then 4 eighths. He feels great all the way through the suboxone, but as soon as it he runs out, he's right back in pretty terrible withdrawal! My main question is, is this withdrawal from the heroin, simply being ""postponed"" by the subs, or is this withdrawal to suboxone. I'm obviously VERY sensitive to withdrawal and I'm battling to get sober for my girlfriend and in prep for medical school (and bc I just can't take going through thisbanymore) but I can't make it through cold turkey.

I'm not sure if I have articulated myself well, basically do each opiates have their own withdrawals; if I take heroin and am on the last day of withdrawal and take enough vikoden to get high, will my body revert right back to day one of heroin withdrawal?

Anyway, I had this dream a couple months ago. In my dream, I was sitting on a couch between an old boyfriend from a few years ago and his friend whom I had never met in real life. His friend shot up my left arm with heroin at that instant I actually felt in my dream an overwhelming rush of exhileration and pleasure- like a combination of being on a roller coaster and seeing cute fluffy kittens at the same time. Anyway, it felt like my body and soul lifted upwards off the couch and the roof opened up and disappeared and I floated, as if in zero gravity above the house in the bright, glorious sunlight. Everything was white and pure and shining, bright enough to nearly blind me and I felt physical euphoria running from my heart, out through every vein and nerve in my body and out to each finger, toe and strand of hair. This lasted about 30 seconds until my body lowered back down, slowly, like I was a light object that was deflating, back down, down through the open roof which closed behind me and I plopped back down comfortably on the couch I had been sitting on. After that, I lounged in this soft, cozy, comfortable haze where I felt so incredibly at peace. The guy who had shot me up, stood up, leaned down to me and looked into my eyes with a concerned and subtly tragic look and said something profound (and of course, I would forget what it was that he said!!!) but it was something along the lines of ""You've done it. You're done now."" But at the time I could barely hear him I was so wrapped up in my absolute state of happiness.

I like my life right now. It's not great, but it's not bad either. However when I see someone on tv, or YouTube using dope and see how fucked up and miserably euphoric they are I miss it. I miss dope, and I envy those people that are high. I know how bad reality is, but I get a sense of nostalgia and wish I could use. My question for everyone that is clean right now: Whenever you see videos or images of people obviously strung out and nodding off, being a junkie, do you miss the lifestyle? Do you miss the incredible highs that come with the depressingly low, lows? I know how bad of an idea it would be to use again, but fuck, watching people use makes me envious. I want that. If y'all could leave some input that would be great! I'd love to have a good discussion about this. ",1459994010.0

Also, waking up at 5am in the beginning stages of gettin sick and taking some subs and waiting for them to kick in.

The sole purpose was to shrink my pupils after using stims to get to work without saucer pupils. I did a small test and undoubtedly my pupils got back to normal (The stim I used was an RC that has a really long half-life, so tomorrow after the H effect has gone I'll still have saucer pupils)

My question is: Is it safe to use with an antispsychotic, particularly Olanzapine? I depend on Olanzapine to sleep (rx'd by my psych), well otherwise I'll just get unbearable insomnia (no sleep at all until it's time to work). It was Rx'd by a psych because I developed a huge tolerance to benzos and no benzo was working for me, including the most potent hypnotic ones like Brotizolam.

I used opiates before (codeine, fentanyl), although never with this purpose. The thing is, H was the only thing I could get my hands on. Tomorrow morning I'll probably have to dose in order to keep my pupils in ""check"" before work.

I also need to drive to the nearby pharmacy that's open now (it's past midnight where I live) to get some Hydroxyzine because the typical itchiness of opiates is definitely there. I'm hoping a relatively high dose of Hydroxyzine does the trick for me and puts me to sleep.",1459984417.0

I recently came across some op80s, I know boo, but I'm not looking to get super fucked just a little buzz. I'm on 2mg suboxone daily for the last few months sometimes I miss a day but usually stick to the 2mg every morning. 

So for my 2 part question:

1. Does the old throwing OPs in cola over night and then drinking still turn them into IR or have they made that ""safer"" now as well?

2. What kinda dose you guys think will have me just feeling good? I don't wanna get blasted (woulda just grabbed some H n rigs for that) but don't wanna waste my time either. So any suggestions? I was gonna start with 40mg and if that doesn't do it drink the other 40 (split the 80 basically). Y'all think that's to much based on my only 2mg of sub maintenance? Sorry I've just never been on this low a dose of sub, I thought the Drs were right and you need 16-24mg a day to kick a serious H habit.

first off: this is a long story. There's a recap at the very bottom but if you can find the time to read the whole shebang, please do! 

I've been lurking here for a while but I never really felt the need to post. This time is different though. I'm at a crossroads and I could use any advice you have to offer. You're experienced in this game, so you're my last hope guys and gals!

I'm 22 years old. I was the prodigal son so to speak, perfect grades when I graduated and I headed straight for Uni with an academic scholarship under my belt. I live in Germany so education is ""free"" but the scholarship covered all my monthly expenses easily and left me with a nice disposable income. I quickly realized that college is different from HS. I grew disillusioned with my first major and wound up changing. That fucked my self-esteem pretty good since I was used to things going my way if I just bust my ass hard enough. I just didn't feel comfortable though and I could not see myself in that line of work for the rest of my life.

My second major started off well (last April for reference). I made friends and got my grades in order, I was in performance mode. I'd always been a person that drew all his self-esteem from achievements, academic ones to be exact. I was always semi-popular and slightly awkward so I was obsessed with other people's thoughts on me. Studying and as a result earning good grades helped me gain my peers' respect and also gave me a role, my little corner in the world. Unfortunately, that means that all my self-esteem hinges on my performance.

Here's where opiates come in. I wound up studying in a major city and, never having left my little town before, fell victim to its temptations. In Germany, we only have a handful of pharms so I was on Oxy for only 1 month before smoking H for the first time. You guys know the feeling, the relief, the deep relaxation...needless to say I was in love and still am.

From May-Sep I was a functioning addict. Did well in school while smoking up everyday. At some point my finances were threatening to spiral out of control. In a retarded effort to make my addiction economical I started shooting up like a dumbass. Of course my world came crashing down afterwards. I had always toyed with the idea of dropping out for the second time, because deep down, I wasn't happy with major #2 either. Dope helped bury these feelings. After 300 Eurobucks went up my arm in one week though I forced myself to start WDing, which meant I was honest to myself. 

So I dropped out for the second time. Academic scholarship gone, parents pissed, isolated from my friends (okay my fault), I went off the rails. From Oct to Jan I spent copious amounts of cash on dope. My parents noticed and took me in mid-Jan, me being in terrible shape. I sobered up but only lasted two weeks. I had no future ahead of me so why not keep slamming right?!

Anyway I slowly regained a sense of direction. I'd always been interested in Math so I looked into Computer Science. I passed multiple assessment tests and was finally invited to a job interview for a huge international corporation here in Germany. They pretty much have their own college where I'd earn my Bachelor's in CS. Afterwards I can go for a Master's or dive in at the corp. Either way, I'd get paid to study there with a secure job in my pocket after graduating. I was so happy when they accepted me and told me I could start this year, I literally felt a surge of energy overcome me.

The problem is: I'm not clean. I'm a few days on and a few days off, depending on my finances. Old habits die hard I guess. I have 6 months to get this shit off my mind so I can focus on my new opportunity. I don't want to mess this up. What do you suggest?! How do I go about overhauling my mindset?

TL;DR
Been using dope for almost a year now, shooting up for 5 months (both on and off). Fucked up and dropped out twice. Now have an opportunity to earn a Bachelor's degree in a field I care about working for a multinational corp while getting paid as a student and having a guaranteed job lined up with them afterwards. Got 6 months left to sober up and change my mindset back to the normal person I used to be.

I've blacked out once from this combination (due to getting to wacky and ended up downing more than I thought I did...aka 7+ norcs/10+ soma). Ive been using daily with patches of sobriety/weaker opiates happening sporadically throughout the years.


Story:
My go to guy (been solid for 1.5yrs) recently started acting sporadic with the supply, noting that a bunch of pill mill pharmacies got shut down in Houston. So not only did the supply/demand balance get all fucked up, the prices started going up. So I found another guy, one of his old running mates who was newer in the game and was still trying to build clientele, so prices were affordable. My new guy runs low on supply, so I have no choice but to hit up my old connect. He sells me 15 10/325 Watsons and 30 carisprodol (DAN) 350mgs. I take 2 hydros and 3 somas (daily manageable dosage) of this stuff from my old guy and I black out and get shown videos of me walking around the house doped out of my mind, doing random shit, saying shit that dont make sense and etc. I chalked it up to being a one off and thinking ""ok well my body just gave out yesterday"". 



So I repeat the next day with only 1 hydro and 2 soma. Im slurring like im on 8 hydros / 10+ somas, fast foward...i blackout again and wake up to a pissed off girlfriend and a family intervention. Been thinking about it since it happened (im off everything, taking small pieces of a suboxone to ward off withdraws till I can hide them via the weekend/no work) and I ran into this on CNN:

Ended up running into an old friend that actually got me into H except now he is clean and into Jesus and stuff.. He surprised me and had a nice rock of H which actually looked more like Hash and we smoked some and I took some extra so I could go IM somewhere, because I usually don't smoke it.

I'm sure he missed the cash flow I was giving him. Anyway, he's been a lot nicer to me and has only snapped at me a few times since then. He got even nicer when he accidentally gave me two bags and I drove back to give him the other back instead of pocketing it. It was very tempting to tell him that I didn't have the other bag, but I'm too much of an honest person.

Anyway, the other day I go pick up and I realize that I should have an extra $27 and I don't. Well, shit. What did I do? It hit me that I must have at least gave my dboy an extra $20 and I didn't think he would fess up to it. I call him and tell him I'm missing at least $20 and did I accidentally pay him extra. I shit you not but he said to give him a few seconds... He gets back on the phone and tells me that I overpaid him by $30! I was like damn.

I got some u-47700 last month and started using every week, then every three days, then every day very rapidly. All behind my live-in girlfriend's back.

I had almost no tolerance when I started and would plug 15mg and nod and now I need 75mg to nod and started IVing. Luckily, I just ran out 2 hours ago and am glad to be able to get out before it got too serious. I'm going to use this oprotunity to quit for good and stear clear of opiods/opiates completely from now on. I'm going to use kratom for the next few days to make the transition easier and then i'm out.

I have some quick questions about poppy seed tea, as currently I am unable to visit the doctor and have severe wisdom tooth pain that I need to ignore for a couple of days.

1. About how long does it last?

2. Compared to Kratom, what are the upsides/downsides?

3. How does it compare to traditional opiates?

4. Is it more or less addicting that diacetylmorphine (heroin) or about the same?

Sidenote, I may or may not have experience with various substances, and I'm certainly not unfamiliar with sedating relaxants, especially opiates. But I have absolutely no experience making or drinking poppy seed tea, or poppy pod tea.

Pods are not available in my area, so I'm attempting to go with seeds if its worth it for temporary pain relief. Thanks all!

This actually happened before I went down my path of addiction. Last fall. Just wanted to see if other people will agree that it was beyond fucked up.

I was in foster care, my mother and I don't have the best relationship. However, I NEVER wanted my mom to know I did heroin. I just feel so ashamed and I don't want my mom to worry about that. I don't live at home, I don't visit her that often. But I seriously feel so ashamed of her knowing. Now I'm an addict, which makes it worse. But seriously.... I'll never forgive him for that. I think it was so fucked up and shitty. Seriously. I would NEVER do that to him. And I didn't even after he did it to me. Even though he was addicted at the time, I still didn't do it.

By the way: for a small backstory. He ratted on me because he owed me money. A large sum of money. $600. I won't go into the details because it's not that relevant but long story short we had planned a vacation together over Labor Day weekend. He couldn't afford his share of the hotel and some other things so I spotted him. Big mistake. He never even attempted to pay me back and would turn it on me. He lives at home and gets everything subsidized by his parents and grandparents. He's a typical spoiled ignorant little boy. He knows I pay my own bills and am on my own. He fycked me over. I offered to have him do a payment plan and shit. I gave him so many chances. He just blew it off and had no intention of paying me back. I warned him that I needed the money and was gonna have to tell his family. (They're rich and they'll cover his shit). He played games and I did. It was a matter of money and I desperately needed it. I got my money the next day. He told my mom I did heroin and threatened to call my landlord and the city police and tell them I have drugs and alcohol in room.

Ive done it like this -

1) Put dope on spoon

2) Add 40cc of water

3) Stir it up

4) Add like 3-4mg of food grade citric acid bought from grocery store

5) Stir it up again

6) Heat it to the point where first bubbles appear and then stop

7) Apply filter on the needle and draw the solution in, its usually pitch black

I also have 2 .5 xanax and I've heard mixed reviews in the past about people using benzos to potentiate. I'm not sure if I should mess with mixing them or not and would love some of your guys' opinions. Also I don't know if it matters, but I'm going to be plugging the blues.

&nbsp;

What are some limits you guys have set and subsequently squashed in the name of her highness? Do you have any left?  Big or small, share em all. 

&nbsp;

To be fair, I'll start. It started that I'd never do heroin. As curious as I was, I knew it was a bad idea. SQUASHED. I'd never pick up more than once a month, never use more than once a month, once a week, never on a weekday, never more than once a day, etc etc etc. SQUASHED. I'd never spend money that wasn't completely disposable. SQUASHED. I'd never get high if I had work the next day. SQUASHED. I'd never shoot. SQUASHED. After ODing and almost dying (if not for Narcan, I'd be a pile of cremains in a jar on someone's shelf), I'd never shoot again. SQUASHED. Never be high around my family. SQUASHED. 

&nbsp;

The only boundary I haven't crossed, really, is getting high at work (huge no no on my job), and not getting high around a certain family member.

At this point, we're just wondering if there's any way he can ""fake"" taking his Suboxone strip. The only ideas we currently have are:

* wrapping the Suboxone strip in Scotch tape to prevent it from dissolving under his tongue

* drying out his mouth prior to taking the Suboxone strip so it doesn't dissolve and he can spit it out as soon as possible

Its a very long read, and Ill also breif up on some background info to how the whole thing came about. So with all the news lately, Im sure most yall've heard of Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman(and his compa Mayo Zambada). Well, before Chapo and Mayo were major leaguers, there was the Arellano Felix brothers and Amado Carrillo Fuentes, of the Tijuana and Juarez Cartels, respectively. There were others like Juan Garcia Abrego(leader of Gulf Cartel at the time) and the Milenio Cartel, but the large majority of traffickers in this time frame(the mid-late 80s through to 1997 or so) worked under either Amado Carrillo or the Arellanos. They were the prodigal sons of the factionalization of the Guadalajara Cartel(led by Rafael Caro Quintero, Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo, and Don Neto Fonseca - the alleged murderers of DEA agent Kiki Camarena). After the crack down on the Miami/Caribbean routes, this is who the Colombians mostly looked to,, to move the product. The Guadalajara Cartel had a chokehold on Mexican drug trafficking in their time and were mostly the only game in town. Sure there were other independents like always, but they were the biggest money machine. 
  

-----Kiki Camarena led the operation which busted the biggest weed grow op in known history as far as Ive heard, valuing in the billions. He was subsequently allegedly tortured and murdered by the owners(the Guadalajara Cartel) in 1985. ""Allegedly"" because some people persist with the idea that CIA played a significant role in the murder(I doubt it though not outside the realm of possibility). After Agent Camarena's murder, the wrath of the US gov't was inflicted upon the Guadalajara Cartel and most of the top dogs were hunted down. Miguel Felix Gallardo apparently didnt want his empire to disappear with his downfall, so like Lucky Luciano, he divided his Cartel up among the major lieutenants. The Arellano Felix bros and Amado Carrillo emerged as the most powerful, with their Tijuana and Juarez cartels. It should be noted that 90% of these dudes are from Sinaloa, despite their respective bases of operations. 
   

----So this is where the story begins, with the Arellano Felix brothers and Amado Carrillo becoming the main players. Chapo Guzman, Mayo Zambada, El Azul, the Beltran Leyva brothers, Nacho Coronel, etc pretty much all worked under or alongside Amado Carrillo Fuentes. He was the Pablo Escobar of Mexico, with a net worth somewhere around $25 billion. The richest and most powerful Mexican drug trafficker of all time in most peoples' opinion. This series mostly focuses on the Arellano Felix brothers, and their struggles with Chapo Guzman, Mayo Zambada, Guero Palma, and company.

Thought some might be interested in where the dope you love so much comes from, along with the repercussions of conflicts fueled by the greed and chase for wealth in selling said dope. And no, ECP doesnt only come from Colombia. The Sinaloans brought in Colombian chemists to show them how to make diamorphine HCl  well over 10 years ago, and have gone on to take over a majority of the heroin market in the US, with the Colombians and their product in 2nd place(as far as quantity atleast), and Asian dope an extremely distant 3rd. Something like 4% I believe is Asian in origin. This is all according to the US DOJ and DEA.",1460060349.0

4dsjop,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/4dsjop/my_story_a_warning_to_the_newer_opiboys/,14,https://redd.it/4dsjop,BigKahuna33,My story: A warning to the newer opiboys,"Hey guys! I'm pretty new to this sub and I've really loved participating in discussions and such, but I've come to realize many things about my habit of doing heroin. 

I come from an addictive family, My grandparents drank HARD (the daily handle types). The anger and selfishness caused my parents to cut ties with both sides. What this means for me is that I've been given The ""Incurable Smart Mans Disease"" as my counselor calls it. I'll never be able to get away from having an addictive personality, it'll always be with me, like flies on cow shit. 

Now, I started off by smoking weed like many people, I was depressed and looking for my identity. I looked in the wrong places obviously because my friends were insane. For my experience at the time I was just trying to fit in, my friends were ""flavor of the day"" users taking whatever appealed to them in the moment. It caused me to use shit loads of different drugs, 25i to PMMA(thinking it was molly :(. ). I eventually realized how these ""friends"" didn't even care about me, they would steal from me and walk all over my kindhearted nature. It hurt and it eventually caused me to cut ties with them. 

It was about 5 months ago that I got reintroduced to an old school friend. At the time I had a good job, a great friend circle, and a potential girlfriend. Life was nice for once, until I started really hanging with my friend X. X was a great guy, charismatic and funny with plenty of compassion, Unlike my other ""friends"" he was truly compassionate and cared for me and my friendship. This change was refreshing because my new friend circle didn't do drugs and I was still very much addicted to the lifestyle. Well come 1 month later My friend X started shooting H. ALOT. it got to the point where he passed out in my car multiple times and I had to beat his face to wake him up, scary shit, it made me kinda reevaluate my choice to be friends with him. So I cut ties, knowing heroin was a steep slippery slope. Thinking ""I'd never do that"" ""I'd never stoop that low."". Well when I lost my job and work friends, I turned to the very thing I said I'd never go to. I started hanging with X again and smoking tar off of tin foil. The hole I had inside me was just getting bigger. 

I consider myself addicted even though I only use bout twice a week or biweekly. And the thing is I may not have withdrawals, but I fiended like no other. I realized that if I'd continue this shit I could end up living my life addicted to heroin, surviving day to day looking for my next hit. And it's scary man. I never EVER thought I'd get to a point like this, but low and behold I'm the very thing I mocked and laughed jokingly at saying ""Ah I'm better than those guys, I will never go there and get addicted."" And here I am. I have no Job, A collapsing friend group, and a girlfriend who's in the dark about my habits with what to show for it? Nothing. 

So for all of you newer guys let me just say this. I was once just like you, I said I could handle doing Heroin once and then never again, but It's all a facade created by our brains. Your brain can sometimes be your biggest enemy. 

So as of this week I have decided to stop. Heroin no matter how regularly used is still dangerous. It makes me wish I would have reconsidered taking it the first time, Not listening to those older members of this sub when they warned me about the slippery slope. So I just wanna reach out to the newer guys/gals and ask, Is potentially dying/losing your will and life to heroin worth the high? I care for you all and wish the best! This story may be choppy, but It highlights underlying message that you can very much become the thing you wished you'd never become. 

Take care and much love r/Opiates! :D",1460055341.0

I am not even sure that I am on the right thread, so please forgive me if I have it wrong! 
I just really need to get this out. I'm stuck in the middle of shame and embarrassment. I have no one who I could talk to about this, other than my boyfriend knowing, I was a secret user but in some ways it has leaked out.. some with and without my permission. 

I have been using for nearly 2 years and I am 25 years old. My usage of drugs in general falls back totalling around 12 years, which is a long fucking time. This alone despresses me and puts tears of huge shame in my eyes. I have a few ideas of why I started Heroin though. I was never concerned until I started this. 
My mother passed away 3 years ago. I decided to take an opportunity and follow my dreams of traveling to help with the greif and try to enjoy a new lease of life. It served it's purpose but when I returned I had no where to go to so ended up in the homeless process of this city. I went to a hostel. I was surrounded with Heroin users and befriended one, not knowing he was on it. I questioned him anyway as I was aware that some people did use there, he lied and told me he wasn't. I stopped talking to him for unrelated reasons. That's how close to this stuff I was. At the time, I was thoroughly against it. Heroin, crack, ket and weird pills were my boundaries. I was dead against it. 

Until something happened and a worker at this hostel sexually assaulted me. He got sacked and an investigation went underway but nothing more than that happened. 

And then, I started.

Since then, I went on a painful course of life, I now finally have a flat. I got clean for a few months and during my sobriety, I told my Dad. I knew what with him being wise, that he may of already guessed and I was correct. To my relief he took it well but I could tell that he didn't really understand it. He is very old school. 
Like I said, it has leaked out in ways, that did not have my blessing. 
Once, my sister asked me if I was on it? I tried to keep my cool. I laughed, and denied it. ""Where did you get that shit from?!"" I said. ""Oh, x told me"" X was so called ""friend"" with big mouth who lived at the hostel and had a terrible habit. 
Also, old dealer who dealt weed to all of my old friends had said that he heard rumours from someone (he could not remember who) that I was on heroin and a prositute. The 2nd part is untrue. I'm wondering whether this comment was made to start rumour mongering and generally to be a dick or whether said person said it because they had seen or heard something? I probably will never know. 

Yesterday my brother was talking in such a way that it has raised my suspicion that he also knows. 

I'm worried my close friend knows because of A. Dealer mentioned something (or friend started the rumour, he knew I was in a hostel surrounded by drug users and commented constantly on it. Even though he was in a hostel somewhere else at the time) or B. Surprise visit round to mine and because I wasn't expecting him he may of spotted some dirty foil, am not sure. He never said anything. I quickly sat down on the fucking thing put my hand under there and removed it to the bin in a slick no notice James Bond fashion. I'm worried he knows. He has not replied to a message I sent him and he near enough always replies. Am I just being paranoid?
I am full of shame and dispair. I am in dire need of advice. I am scared shitless  that I will be judged. I keep a nice home. Look after myself. Etc. But none of that matters if one has this label. What do I do? Shall I confront them or keep my fingers crossed and hope no one finds out? I am not comfy with either..so..something else? I had to post on here so I have some anonymity.
Thankyou.

Things fairly falling apart, worried everyone knows who I care about.

Edit 2: I had to cut the post short earlier because my laptop died. I wrote a reply to a comment and I'd like to add it to the main text of the thread.
My comment:
Well basically I have chronic pain because of a car accident that I got in about 10 months ago. (Link: https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/39xfsp/member_of_the_subreddit_got_in_a_bad_car_accident/)

Subs seem to help a little bit with pain for me. I've never had a truly serious long-term habit, but I will go on stints/binges sometimes and experience pretty brutal physical WD.

I'd rather go with subutex because I feel like (though I'm not sure, haven't done enough research about it yet) subutex would help more with chronic pain because it lacks the antagonist, naloxone.

I'm not sure about methadone, but I feel like it could arguably be the best choice for pain control/maintenance. However, I have heard lots of people say methadone made it much harder to quit and also heard people say it made it much easier.

My pain management doctor is willing to prescribe me opiates. However, I'd have to pass at least two urine tests (a month apart) and unfortunately, since I smoke and am exposed to weed quite often, and how long THC stays in the system ( though I do have quite a high metabolism ) that's kind of hard for me to do as weed makes me feel better a little bit.

And I'm not sure I even want to go that route, because as far as I know myself I feel like I'd be tempted to take much more than the recommended dose, (100-150+ mg of oxycodone in the form of roxis). After my car accident I was prescribed massive amounts of roxicodone, such as 90x20mg roxi and several scripts of 160+ 10mg roxi. This is where my addiction really went downhill.

Right now I have about 150mg of u47700, which I ordered before my recent overdose, which I believe involved fentanyl (also caught a possession charge for h) and spent the night in jail. I traded 90mg of it for .4 of pretty good white. That's why I'm kind of writing a lot. My apologies. lol.

It seems a lot of people are under the impression that bupe is a detox drug, but I was under the impression that it is a treatment drug. You still feel the withdrawals you ran from when you stop taking them.. you might be able to stay completely opiate free for a week or two, but I know that with a dependency and brain like mine I would probably end up relapsing sometime in the future, if not immediately. So your only options would be to keep taking subs to keep your mind off dope, or to just full on relapse and say fuck it, either way you are getting sucked back in to the cycle that is opioid dependence.

I'm looking at sub life to my next life, so when I read about people wanting to ""quit dope with subs,"" I kind of laugh and shrug it off in my head, but if people can do it, more power to em.

I've been using poppy tea nearly daily for the past 7 - 8 months or so. Mainly to deal with my anxiety and depression. When it works it works, but frankly I'm sick of the stuff now. My tolerance has raised to the point that I have to drink enough to feel sick due to the thebaine to feel high. Usually I just drink to avoid the hellish withdrawal. The physical symptoms aren't so bad but the mental anguish is hellish. I can't sleep when I drink tea, so usually when it wears off I'm very tired, and I crash so fucking hard. I just sit there crying and thinking about killing myself, not nice stuff.

I've been on a ""I'll quit this time"" bend for the past 4 or so times I've ordered my pods. Inevitably the last of my tea wears off and I'm in hell, thinking about what an idiot I was thinking I could quit. This time rather than buying pods, I ordered a small bag (.2g) of dope and an 8mg sub (and a lil' bit of weed). My hope is to just use dope every now and then, and use the sub to do a quick taper, or even just use subs rather than poppy tea.

I have a detox and treatment service fairly close to me, I'm thinking about going there and explaining my situation. Will they take me seriously if I say that poppy tea is my drug of choice? Honestly, it's at the point where I'm going to switch to dope anyway, money being the only reason I haven't so far. Poppy tea is really cost effective until your tolerance rises... Ideally I'd like to quit but I don't think I could at the moment, so I'm hoping that I can get away with just using some dope when I get paid and subs to save my wallet. Maybe sort my train wreck of a life out a bit before I think about quitting for good. Do they drug test at these kind of places? 

Also, will the buprenorphine stop helping my mood eventually? I've used it once before and it basically made me feel ok. Not great or high, just, you know, ok. Which compared to how I usually feel when I don't have opiates is heaven, so I'd like to not ruin its effects in the way I have with poppy tea.

Thanks for any advice :)",1460165740.0
4dzapl,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/4dzapl/filthy_homes/,55,https://redd.it/4dzapl,bad--doge,Filthy Homes,"Two examples:

One home is a hybrid-hoarder type house. It's small, but not tiny. You can see evidence of hoarding immediately but fortunately a non hoarder has co-opted portions of the house. For instance the living room is tidy, except for the walls. Books and boxes are stacked sometimes two deep to the ceiling, full of dry tinder. I meant, ummm full of valuable books and vintage clothes. Hoarding has many parallels to drug addiction so I can't overlook the hoarding as an unorganized person. Usually this stuff bothers me because it makes the environment dangerous and unhealthy. I don't like the feeling of cave exploration when I'm walking through a house.

The second home is the absolutely filthy house, caused by unbelievably lazy dirty scrum bags. The first thing you notice when you walk through the broken front door is the odor....yes folks O D O R. You quickly glance around to find the culprit but your brain overloads at the filth. An extremely worn and brown carpet shows multiple piles of dog shit, newspapers and magazines strewn about carelessly, cigarette butts and ashes burnt into the brown carpet, and of course the dried dog and cat urine. Could that be the cause of the odor or perhaps the overflowing trash that has become a pile that they just throw trash at. You won't know, but you realize quickly that you must BREATHE. You continue walking into the home, fortunately your feet don't make contact with the carpet because you're walking on about 3 inches of trash....is that a diaper...God I hope it's not used. The ash trays are overfilled and you can see the dust and hairs floating through the air. Your brain racks itself for when the last time this home had been cleaned....At least 3 years...maybe 5. Your stomach sinks even more when you realize you need to use the restroom. What horrors await....of course the toilet seat is broke and leaning up against the tank just like the broken door to the bathroom. You can hear everyone talking outside. The toilet bowl is stained a brownish blackish green and will never recover. You can tell there's severe water problems and the toilet won't flush. The sink doesn't work either but there's a 5 gallon bucket of foul water sitting under the sink. You learn from the owner that you need to fill the other 5 gallon bucket in the bathtub that is jerry rigged all to hell too, then pour that water into the toilet so it will flush. No chance of washing your hands in here, you slyly creep to the kitchen. You walk past three of the most filthy people you've ever seen sitting on a couch staring at you. they look like they spent a year on naked and afraid WITH plenty of food. 
Faces and skin dirty, stringy dirty hair and hacking coughs, sores. Cigarettes in every hand or toothless mouth. YOU wear clean clothes everday and also shower so you know they are judging the shit out of you. You finally make it to the kitchen after wading through trash and you find a sink full of dirty stinking dishes but of course no working water. Every counter is stacked to the top with dirty dishes and boxes and trash are strewn about. Is that another diaper....ugh ok that one is definitely used. Your friend shows up and explains theres a sink in the basement and you make the trip down there. Piles, really hills, of clothes are stacked in random places across the basement. Pools of water under the clothes, stagnant water flows by you with a fat cat turd winking. Are you finally losing it, have you succumbed to the fumes? Finally you wash your hands and curse yourself for wearing nice shoes and clothes as they will obviously need to be washed several times or thrown away.",1460163043.0

4e4mno,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/4e4mno/rhodiola_and_clonodine_interaction_2_popular/,8,https://redd.it/4e4mno,air-line,Rhodiola and Clonodine interaction (2 popular items used for opiate withdrawal),"hey guys i just want to let you know there is an interaction between Rhodiola and Clonidine that i just discovered by accident. 

Rhodiola is a potent CYP2D6 enzyme inhibitor and Clonidine is metabolized by CYP2D6 so if your using them both at the same time you should take a much smaller dose of Clonidine then what is normally required for opiate withdrawal or Subutex tapering. 

i have not found any articles or forum posts on the web speaking of this interaction and i know that both of these items are quite popular in opiate detoxing. 

and now on to how i made this discovery:

i am tapering Subutex and have been using Rhodiola for it for the past 6 months or so. i only recently got a script for Clonidine 0.15mg (which i had to convince my doctor to give me even though for medications like benzos, tramadol, and sleeping pills he hands out like candy which is typical in the country i live in. but when it comes to a fucking blood pressure med its like ""hey i can't prescribe that for you. what do you need it for anyway?"").

so after i convinced him to prescribe it for me i decided to try it for the first time on my own (i had received it once in detox and now that i am using it every day for the past 4 days I'm wondering why the heck they didn't give me more of this stuff its freaking amazing!) i got in bed took half a pill and within a few minutes i already felt my blood pressure drop dramatically.

now that was a pretty fast and strong effect for just 0.075 mg of a medication i was told by my brother people normally take 0.1 mg to 0.2 for. but thats not all! my blood pressure over the next few hours continued to drop to really uncomfortable levels and i felt completely glued to the bed. 

so being that I have a lot of experience in enzyme inhibition and drug use the first thing that popped into mind was to check interactions between Rhodiola which i take every 4 to 5 hours and already know to be a CYP2D6 inhibitor and Clonidine with no results. so then i searched for CYP2D6 and Clonidine and bingo! i found a connection.

ok so now i take a quarter pill (0.0375 mg) or less of clonidine about every 12-16 hours with Rhodiola and thats plenty.

so be advised and do grab both of these items (Rhodiola and Clonidine) and make your detox/taper WAY EASIER!

Have been toying with opiates since late 2013, full on addict by early 2014, every day use since, switched to heroin in August 2015 after heavy blues and 8mg Dilaudid use (all nasal). Besides having a needle phobia, I have never been interested in making the jump to IV. My old dealer/friend has shot me up a few times many months ago, and while it was definitely stronger I was disappointed in the length of the high. I think I'm definitely addicted to the snorting ritual too though. I have no interest in switching and all the downsides that come with it (worrying about needles, harder to hide the paraphernalia, hard to do on the go, track marks, worse w/d etc.) But I read on here all the time that plenty of people sniff and sniff for years and then turn to shooting. So I guess my question is: were you like me and never had any interest in it until one day you did? I have already been at the point for a long time that it's very hard for me to even get high anymore. So that wouldn't be a cause for me to switch. Or was it more of a thing that you were never necessarily against but just had like an invisible line saying ""Oh I won't go that far"" until you do? The same way I eventually got to heroin. I was always interested it but tried to resist that urge for a long time. I was just curious about how you guys got there and if you regret it. No judgement, of course. Whenever I meet new dope heads and I ask if they snort or shoot and they shoot and I snort they always act so ashamed like yo we're both addicts! I'm not gonna judge.

Does anyone else on this Sub also enjoy reading? If they do, has anyone here read Infinite Jest? It's considered a difficult book, though I don't think that's really fair. It's a long book. It's a uniquely structured book. It's a book that takes a lot of time compared to most, though this is more because of how it reads and not only because it has a long page count. Anyway, I mention it to you all because it's a book that hits home hard. At the core of this book is the experience of addiction and a lot of the supporting characters are addicted to, or are former addicts of, one form of opiates or opioids or another. One of the main characters (one of the protagonists, Don Gately) had an opiate addiction in their past and is in recovery. Half the book takes place in a recovery house and its quite clear that some of the main themes this book explores (in my opinion) really well is boredom, addiction, recovery, instant gratification, depression, self-control, self-imposed slavery, physical/emotional dependence, freedom, narcissism, solipsism, family relations, friendship, love, and the kind of world, society and culture that these things are symptomatic of. I highly recommend reading it once, and furthermore, I can't recommend enough reading it at least twice. It's a lot of ""work"", but its enjoyable ""work"" and the payoff is really something else as far as literary experiences go. Anyway, now that my plug for IJ is done, I wanted to specifically ask (for those who have read it) if anyone felt the section narrated by ""yrstruly"", otherwise known as [Spoiler](/s Emil Minty), found on pages 128-35, was particularly enjoyable given our lifestyle. I'd love to talk to other people on this sub about it if anyone else happened to read it, whether they liked the book or the passage or not. If anyone was just willing to talk to another addict about this book then I'm equally as interested. If not, then again, please consider taking this relatively large book on. It got me through one of my kicking periods. I read a lot of it my second time through during the 15 days I barely slept. It offered me a lot of moments of insight into what I was doing with my life and what I thought I wanted. Above all I found it very rewarding and legitimately moving, funny, and insanely ingenious. Anyways, hope all of you are feeling well and are feeling the love for yourselves you all deserve.

So I'm 2 weeks clean, and 15 minutes or so ago I go to take a piss, and low and be-fucking-hold, I see a corner of plastic poking out from underneath the goddamn toilet.

My dope.

My fucking dope.

I have searched every corner of this house for this shit 10 times, and it shows up now. I feel tears run down my cheeks, or maybe it was just God pissing on my fucking face...probably the second.

I stare at the bag for about 10 seconds, then manage to throw it in the toilet and flush before I fully comprehend what I'm doing. And sense of pride I might have gotten from this act of righteous willpower flies RIGHT the fuck out the window as I soon find myself on my knees frantically plunging my hands into a toilet full of my own fucking piss trying to correct my terrible mistake. The skulls on the bag seem to be laughing at me as the bag goes down the drain and into the sewers, where it will eventually be found by some rat who will eat it, and then trade his little rat car for 6 dilaudid (the rat didn't need the car anyway, no thumbs and all that). 

Meanwhile I am sitting on my couch with a plate of bacon that I burned badly. I accidentally splashed myself with hot grease, which made me drop my chocolate protein shake. I successfully ""caught"" it with my hip. I put the word ""caught"" in quotations because in this instance it means ""splashed the entire front of my shorts with a doo-doo looking substance.""

And the dark places cry out:

""Here!  Yes, here!

Even here

Dwells the Presence of God!""


Even here

In these cracked pavement streets

Carpeted with broken beer bottles,

Even here

The Goddess dances

Beckoning to all people:

""Fear not!

I have come to bestow upon you

All sustenance and salvation

And I require only one small thing from you--

Your head!""


Even here

Between the pawn shop and the trap house

On the wrong side of the tracks,

Even here

The House of the Lord is founded

Where the doors stand open to all

Who will but dare to walk past

The fearsome angels flanking the threshold.


You can hear the hallelujahs echo

In the back alleyways

As surely as upon the mountaintops

If you will but open your heart to listen.


You can see the face of God

In the deepest darkness

As easily as in the light

If you will but open your heart to see.


The chorus resounds everywhere:

""Here!  Yes, even here!

Even here

In the ghettos!

Even here

In the crack houses!

Even here

In the brothels!

Even here

In the shelters!

Even here

In the shooting galleries!

Even here

In the prisons!

Even here

In every dark corner

And seemingly forgotten crevice

God is always present!""


And yes, the results of God's work

Also shine magnificently

In the bright and pleasant places of the earth.

But if you would dare to see

That healing power itself

As it binds up the wounds of the world

At this very moment,

If you would dare to witness

And participate in

The miracle itself,

Then you must dare to venture into

Those places that are still

Cold and dark and lonely.


Cast off your pride!

Give up your fear!

Let me show you!

I am witness to it,

For I have gone in search of the Divine

In many strange and dark and troubling places,

But I have always found it

Even there--

An overflowing abundance of grace

For all people,

Even me.",1460351365.0

I got this bad boy a little over a year ago and it resides in my dining room:

https://imgur.com/ERrsDmP

I find that when I'm feeling down and depressed over being a broke addict, I hop on the skateboard and play a few rounds.  I almost always end up feeling a little better.  This was my #1 favorite game when I was in my teens, and it is still one of my all-time favorites.  Getting up and actively moving to play a game seems to make me feel better all-around, versus sitting on the couch or standing up at one of my upright arcade cabinets.  

So how about you guys and gals?  What do you do to feel better, besides the obvious chemicals?

EDIT:  I decided to post pics of the machines that are in my living room.  The three uprights are there to greet anyone walking in and really tie the room together IMHO, lol.  And the Pacman cocktail is a machine I built totally from scratch.  I found the blueprints online many years ago, learned how to use power tools (routers KICK ASS!) and used discarded double-sided prefinished cherry plywood from my then-job for the cabinet construction.  That Pac cocktail is my baby.  :)  Anyway, here are the pics of those:

4e97me,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/4e97me/why_i_enable_my_brothers_opiate_addiction/,46,https://redd.it/4e97me,throwawaysocietalnor,"Why I ""enable"" my brothers opiate addiction","This is a really long story that I won't be able to tell all of in one post.

My brother has been an opiate addict for over ten years. I've been through all the ups and downs he's been through, and for a long time I ""helped"" him by trying to get him clean, but not tolerating him using at all. I wondered why he kept struggling in life, why didn't he get clean despite all the support he had?

Because he's never wanted to get clean. I wish he could, but after so long I've realized that nobody lives on the streets shooting dope and being sick half the time because they WANT to. Whatever the reason, one thing has always been consistent: his worst periods have been when he's had trouble maintaining his supply. 

So after seeing him in and out of jail for a couple years, then see him get clean and do well for a couple months while being obviously empty inside, I decided to try an experiment. He's a smart guy, although also very stupid, so I really hoped he could still be reasonable about his addiction if I in turn were reasonable about it, when ""reasonable"" is actually very different from what society asks of us.

So for the last four years I've been supporting his addiction when he needs it. I'm sure some of you won't believe me, but basically, we work on the honor system. With my help he's switched to simply using oral opiates (as far as I know: he could still be IVing on the side but he wears shorts and short sleeves all the time and I don't see any obvious signs. if he's shooting it's occasional at worst), I won't get into detail but some of you can probably guess.

What I really want to say with this post is that it's worked. Better than any detox, or rehab, or methadone or suboxone. He's held down the same job for close to three years now, and within six months he could be making more money than I am. Honestly it's been a couple weeks since he's asked me for money for his habit. We've gone on the honor system: he does his best to support his habit on his own, and not be lazy about it, but when he really needs it, I pay for it. He doesn't pay me back, that was never part of the arrangement. I know this would simply be unacceptable to some, but if it were a kidnapper who had him and said ""give me x dollars or I'll kill him"" it would be a no brainer, and in strictly pragmatic terms, I see it the same way. I don't really have a sense of traditional morals, so for me Its just a matter of what works and what doesn't. I love my brother and I honestly believe he doesn't WANT to rely on me, that's why he struggled for so long, but for whatever reason, genetics, the ""disease"" of addiction or maybe he's just lazy, but I just couldn't stand to see what was happening to him. 

This has just confirmed my strong suspicion: opiate addiction presents challenges no matter what, but without the issue of supply, the other problems are absolutely manageable. He doesn't steal from anyone, he hasn't overdosed since we started this arrangement, he hasn't has any legal problems, and for the past six months since he got promoted, it costs me probably $40 a month on average, just enough to get him through so he can get to work until payday. He's also been sneakily paying me back by asking for my debit card and taking it to the ATM to deposit money, I've always known he felt guilty about being a burden on our family and this just confirms it.

I don't know why I'm posting this exactly, I just want to say that at least for my brother, opiate addicts don't want to do a lot of the things they do, and a lot of the problems are artificially created by inability to maintain supply, mostly caused by prohibition. I'll admit it wasn't as smooth in the beginning, but even when I was almost fully funding his habit, it was cheaper than rehab (which doesn't work at all in my experience) and the results were instant.

So judge me, call me an enabler, in denial, whatever, all I know is I've had my brother back for years now, he doesn't steal, doesn't overdose, has a great job, just gotten back into dating, and I'm happy with that. I don't care if it's ""wrong"".",1460348368.0

I've been a lurker here for a few years (what happened to goodguyneonazi?) and figured I'd finally make a throwaway so I can contribute some.

I'm from Canada, been buming around different towns for most of my adult life.  Currently in Vancouver.  Loving it.  The scene here is absolutely nuts.  Might make a post with some pictures from East Hastings at some point.  It's the skid row basically.  Not sure if it's well known outside of Canada but it's notorious in Canada.  I've been using drugs since 14, hard drugs since 18.  Been into opiates for a couple years now but haven't been totally addicted till this last year.  Right now my use is as high as it's been for my.  Usually do a speedball a day and 4 shots of dope a day.  

Live on the street mostly.  Checked into a shelter once and left probably an hour later.  Bed bugs and smell of piss everywhere.  I'm pretty good at finding decent spots to sleep that are clean and with light to read.  I'm bi so I do a bit of gay4pay.  Was staying with a guy for the last few weeks but got kicked out today.  It was pretty good though.  Buddy gave me 60 a day and smokes and food and shit.  He just got sick of me not being able to function i n bed.  I also work full time as a cook.

I hope I'm able to contribut something here and there on this sub.  I love this place and all of you.  The shitposts and circlejerkary can be exhausting at times but it's been like that since I've been coming here.  

Keep up the good vibes people and happy to be a part of this.

PS.  I have two questions.  Firstly, I did a pretty hefty speedball earlier and I got this weird pain in my neck right after that lasted maybe 5 minutes.  Anybody have this happen?  Not really concerned but just trippy.  

Second question is about the dope I've got the last couple days.  New dboy that's pretty good but the heroin I get is strange to me.  It's tan in color, comes in a dense rock, but it's gummy.  It honestly has the feeling of gum that is dried.  It takes heat and lots of work with the plunger to break down.  Pretty good shit.  About a 6 out of 10 which is better then the average stuff I've been getting.

Do you know if your mother used drugs while pregnant with you (even smoking cigarettes or weed)?

My mother always had addiction problems from what i can remember. She used to be a coke addict (maybe still is), smoked cigarettes and weed heavily since she was 12, and always was somewhat of an alcoholic. I know for a fact she smoked a lot of weed when she was pregnant with me. She said morning sickness was just too bad (bad excuse imo). She smoked cigarettes the whole time also. She had a pretty bad coke habit at the time but said she didnt use it after she knew she was preggo, who knows really though. Her father was an alcoholic too. Many of my aunts and uncles on her side are also addicts of various degrees.

My father had a coke habit and smoked cigarettes too. He quit both when i was very young. He's probably one of the worst potheads i've ever seen though. He's very mentally addicted to weed and turns into a crazy asshole when he runs out. He's father was also an alcoholic. My uncles on his side all have addictions also, except maybe 2 of them.

My siblings and myself are also all addicts (my older half brother is the only one who isnt). My brother is addicted to opiates and my sister is all about her adderall.

**4th edit**  I'm sorry for how this came across, I didn't realize you get a lot of questions like this.  FYI, I'm not some naive college kid looking for answers from a ""freak show"", I'm in my mid-30's going back to school for a career change.  I've never used heroin but I'm no stranger to substance abuse.  The goal of my paper is to show that heroin can be used safely just like alcohol, despite a minority of people being addicted to it just like alcohol.  Additionally, I highlight that long-term heroin use is much less damaging to your body than long-term alcohol use (or long-term cigarette use!), assuming you can avoid an overdose (which is why naloxone should also be OTC).  Also that it's less likely to hurt those other than the user than alcohol is.  To those who were extremely suspicious- I won't reply to you again because I don't want to bother you further, but if you come back and see this I'd be happy to answer all these questions with regards to alcohol (or if anyone else asks).  I could describe my 2-week bender and the resultant day-long panic attack if you like.  I only said I wouldn't share information that could doxx me, I didn't say anything about my personal demons.
______________________
I'm writing a paper for school on how I think heroin should be legal OTC (and a small mention in the conclusion how the logic can be extended to all drugs).  I have scholarly sources, but we can also include anecdotal evidence.  I'd like to have a personal interview or two of people who use and are *not* addicted to counteract all the news stories of overdoses and strung out addicts.

Respond here or PM me, whatever you like.  Thanks!

Edit- Let me clarify what I'm looking for.  Someone who uses either regularly or occasionally, and is confident they could quit anytime they had to, even if it involved slowly tapering off to avoid withdrawal.  Someone who has a regular job/lives a regular life, whose friends and family wouldn't guess they used heroin.

Edit again- I really don't know why I didn't include the questions here in the first place.

_________________________

Please answer only the questions you're comfortable with.  I won't share anything other than the answers you give, not even your username.  I will attribute it in my paper as ""interview with John/Jane Doe"" as appropriate.

My questions-

1. How often do you use heroin?  Is it regular, cyclical, or occasional?  (I.e., daily/weekly, go a while without using it then use for a while, or just periodically.)

2. Have you ever had an overdose scare?  If so, to what do you attribute it? (I.e., was it cut with something like fentanyl, more pure than you were expecting, accidentally because you had reduced tolerance from a period of abstinence, etc.)

3. Do you have a job/are you a full-time student?  If not, why?  (Not judging, the job market is tough right now!)

4. Do you consider yourself psychologically addicted?  Could you quit anytime you wanted to?

5. Are you physically dependent?  If you decided to quit, are you confident you could taper off to avoid withdrawal symptoms?

6. Have you ever gotten in trouble with the law because of your heroin use?

7. Why do you use heroin?  Recreationally, to deal with physical pain, psychological pain/depression, or another reason?

8. Are there times in your life when you feel a stronger desire to use heroin?  E.g., after a bad breakup?

9. Would people close to you be surprised to learn you use heroin?

10. What's your preferred route of administration?

Hey guys, I am a closet opiate user, have been for about the past twelve months and usually only lurk here until recently, therefore the new account. I'm a bit desperate to get your guy's input on something I am currently faced with.

These set in about 24 hours after use and don't make me much uncomfortable at all.

Alright, so on to my question. I've never taken subs before and got my hands on a good amount. I want to avoid PWD at all costs and want to know if it's safe to take a sub yet. I last plugged around a gram and a half of BTH about 42 hours ago. I am not really noticing my normal day 1 or 2 WD symptoms because I've been on Vyvanse for about the past 24 hours.

**TL:DR: People on low dose suboxone or methadone, reported less withdrawal symptoms at the end of the week, when they used cocaine.** (There is a second part saying that the effect was different when on higher doses of opiates, but for the purpose of this post, i'm focusing on lower doses.) 


For the record, i'm talking about after the worst of the withdrawal has passed. Picture 3 or 4 days after tapering down to a .13mg dose of suboxone, or a week after a cold turkey kick. When you're not longer shivering and shaking, but still dont feel %100. 


Lately i've been trying to educate myself about what goes on in the brain during opiate addiction. There is a decent amount of information about how opiate receptors become downregulated (upregulated? whichever one means less sensitive,) when you consistently use, which leads to tolerance and addiction. What I am having trouble finding, is how the receptors turn back to their normal state. (Which would be analogous to saying when your body feels normal again.) This study seems to imply that cocaine use could somehow modify the receptors in a way to coax them back to normal.

Up until this point I was a big contributor to the psychdelic circle jerk that takes place over on /r/drugs and was adamant that I would not try anything ""hard"". 

Although I still love me some psychs(nothing compares to the euphoria I get when I breakthrough on DMT, but I am yet to try IV Coke/Heroin/meth so this might change) I was looking for something that guaranteed a good feeling and was sick of having to actively work to keep myself in a good headspace. So I started at the bottom and got some codeine, which was decent but was only really fun with an extremely low tolerance and mixed with other shit. 

Failing to find any suitable hydrocodone listings and to scared to make the leap to oxy I stumbled across Tramadol and its badass big brother Tapentadol. While reading about the weakness of Tramadol and its major lowering of the seizure threshold I wrote it off and decided to get 20 100mg Tapentadol pills. Now after reading mixed reviews that leant to the negative side, I went in with low expectations. I came home from school and swallowed one alongside water, the taste of it on my tongue was horrid but it went down easy enough with no nausea.

After about 20-40 minutes I noticed a warmth and talkativeness come over me and I was thoroughly enjoying my maths homework but not to the extent of what dexamphetamine does. After a good 2 hours I decided to retreat to my room, open up A Feast for Crows and just enjoy the subtle euphoria that was caressing my body. Eventually I decided to dose 3 more pills bringing me to 400mg total to really get a feel for what this exotic opiate had to offer. An intense sedation came over me and started to get visuals of dancing lines and the like. I continued to read and was generally in a pretty good place psychically and mentally. The effects slowly tapered off over a few hours and the only side effects I noticed were classic opiate ones as in constipation, itching and rather strong urinary retention.It did not inhibit my sleep and I felt no ill effects the next day.

Overall tapentadol is a highly underrated opiate and can provide a nice relaxed high to those who want something new and lack a heavy tolerance. Sure it isn't better then oxy but it is a hell of a lot cheaper and due to the lack of severe euphoria I believe it is probably far less addicting. Be wary of the SNRI/SSRI effects however and much like Tramadol mixing with other drugs could lead to serotonin syndrome.",1460450038.0

I've never felt so hopeless and helpless and just.. So low. What an awful way to be. If depressed people feel like I do now, not saying id ever do it, but I actually came to realize how it's possible for someone to end their life. The thing keeping me from that is knowing its temporary and drug induced.

Anyway, understanding true depression for the first time because of opiates has really changed me. I now think feeling happy and healthy is more important than money and status and anything else really. You can't engage in life feeling that low all the time.

I think that was a great idea, It was stickied at the very top always if I remember correctly. It was pretty active for a while, but then everyone just kept making the individual posts specific to area. The only thing about the maga-thread that wasn't ideal was that it was hard to check to see if your area had any bad batches circulating, cuz then you really had to look and make sure there in your area, and often I personally would forget to check. 

Maybe we can resurrect the mega-thread, and when somebody posts in it about a bad batch of diesel, the mods can update the title of the post to the specific area. it wouldn't be much different than having than having to sticky each thread that gets posted, rather just update the name of the mega-thread to include the area, and then the comments can be used for more specific details.

The docs diagnosed them as 'pseudoseizures' basically attributed to hella drug use. I mean I guess this isn't a bad assumption to make on their part when there is weed, heroin, cocaine, meth, MDMA, 4 benzos, and some other shit in your system, but that is not the real reason they are happening.

I love to make people laugh, regardless of whether I'm sober at the time or not, and often, the laughter is at my expense. However, I don't mind at all- it's all in the past now, and funny is funny. So, away we go!!!



------#4: The First Fart--


As much as I loathe my ex these days, I also have (and always will) a lot of love and support for the asshole. He has become a totally different dude during the course of his addiction. This is a little glimpse back into our ""golden days"". For those of you following FST, this event took place just prior to the horrifying Bath salt Granola Bar episode, maybe a scant two or three days before.



Anyhoo, so my Prince Charming had only asked me to be his Trap Queen/Boo Bear/Girlfriend like three days before, and we were happy as could be. After a long night of hanging together in our hotel room with Jack Daniel's, we had laid down to rest for a bit, spooning adorably beneath our plush 15 & 1/7th thread count Egyptian Sylk(thats faux synthetic, haha) covers, so comfortable in our bliss. He had yet to divulge the fact that he snored like a buzz saw, and we were enjoying resting in the peace and quiet. I was feeling so warm, so fuzzy; just genuinely happy in the way only doing dope or being in love can make you feel. And I'm sure most people know that half awake, yet half asleep feeling, where you can still hear stuff going on around you (pretty much a no head bobbing nod, lol), and I am pretty sure my man, who is drooling a booze-tainted river down my shoulder is dead to the world, when it hits me. A gas bubble is painstakingly, elaborately carving a route through my whiskey-ravaged intestinal tract. There is no time to stop the force of nature now, and the best I could manage in my half-conscious state is a desperate clenching of my asscheeks. And still, it weasels it's way through - ""PppphhhhhhhhweeeEEEEEeeeeep!"" . Mortified, I pray that the gorgeous new boyfriend, whose dick I just farted on, is crashed out fully and somehow didn't hear it. The thought of it tickled me, and my belly jiggled a bit as I stifled a giggle. And that's when I hear him. He's laughing too, the little bastard!


We cracked up every time we remembered that, and I always gave him props for not chalkin up the Deuce's when that happened haha. Bless his shriveled lil heart.



------V5: DayDrunk------



This ones short, but fun. Waaay back before I met peckerhead from the above story, I would drink all day, every day, to the point I'd black out and occasionally do stupid shit to embarrass myself (and sometimes the people around me). I was also heavy into Ecstasy and was slangin it at the time. I had been over at my best friends house, a socially awkward farm-dwelling cowboy/wannabe biker badass we'll call J. I used to like to help J to blossom into the beautiful, awkward butterfly I knew he was by throwing bonfire parties on his property and inviting the bros n hoes from my old high school to come turn up, and that weekends party was especially bumpin cuz I had bought (well paid my older neighbors to buy) some booze,  pike a 30 rack of BL, like two handles of vodka and a couple fifths of my favorite, cheap ass rum. AND I had just re upped on the bomby thizzles, which were white Macintosh Pok√®balls (pballs were always quad stacks). We spent the weekend racking out foot long lines of ills, drowning in alcohol,  smoking weed and meth and cigarettes by the carton, and that lasted Fri morning- Monday morning. 

I had squirrelled away a bottle of rum to use as hair dog type thing, but being the alchy I was, I just ended up puggin the whole fifth. By mid afternoon, my buddy J noticed I was missing, and, fearing for my safety, he set out looking for me.


Before I go any furthers let's set up the lay of the land. His farm sits at the end of a long dirt road, which opens into a T Type stop. If you took the left branch, and then an immediate right, you are on an arterial road connecting the neighborhood streets to a little 4lane highway. This highway is pretty much a string of asphalt through dusty dry dead desert, interspersed with track homes. A
And if you took a left onto the we from the arterial road, you'd get a shopping center.


Anyhoo, after searching the property for me and being unable to find me, J hops on his mountain bike, making extra sure he wears all and excessive amounts of black from head to toe, to better function in the frigid 110¬∞ weather that afternoon.


Now, I had blacked out sometime around 10 AM but kept drinking cuz I ain't no bitch, so this had to be relayed to me by a hysterically laughing J. It seems he got his bike almost all the way to the end of the dirt road, which was tract homes to one side, fields n farmhouses on the other. When he spots me ambling along, cool as a cucumber, butt ass naked.


He slammed on his brakes, hopped off his bike and asked me what in the fuck I thought I was doing? I guess I told him I was headed to the shopping center for... Get ready... Deodorant! Lmfao. I said it was so hot and I didn't want to stink, so I had to make moves! Ahaha. He then dragged me back to His place, clothed, and locked me in his moms room so she could babysit while I was ptfo.

This happened back in September and I was forced to say goodbye to those two medications, and my doctor added that it'd be impossible now to get those prescriptions as it's becoming more and more difficult to get them.  Now they are suggesting 'meditation, massage and yoga' rather than prescriptions.  I have zero experience with the streets.  I asked an acquaintance about it and they said you don't get pain pills or klonopin from people who sell weed; you get them from older people or folks who live in section 8 high rises who need a little bit of money and don't need the prescriptions they get.  Not that I'm going to run out and look for it, but has this been your experience?  How do you get these pills?

The thing is, I went through a tough few weeks without them after I was cut off.  Physically I couldn't sleep and nothing seemed fun anymore since I had a whole routine of getting my prescriptions at certain times, the build-up and excitement of the refill date - all of these things made it seem like such an exciting journey once a month - and then that day it'd be like Christmas getting all these pills.  Nothing has topped that...so while I no longer feel physically dependant on these pills, I am always thinking about them, thinking about how much fun it was to go on the whole chase to the pharmacy and even more so, the reassurance that I had this supply of pills 'just in case'.  Having nothing sucks.  

Just my thoughts I guess.  ",1460398560.0

Need to Talk to someone.","Well, I've always wondered why anyone would want to quit opiates forever. They make you feel good, so why would you want to? Last night and this morning (so far) has been why, for me, I am going to quit. 

I was trusted with an elderly neighbors key to her apartment. She ha hip surgery and I had been getting her groceries/ taking out her trash and recyclables/ helping around her house. I wasn't being paid for this - I just know she needed help and tried to do what I could. I knew she had sterling silver sets in her home, and had not really thought much of it until I was in WDs one day. I knew she was out at a Dr.s Appointment when I unlocked her door, went in, and stole the sterling silver I found.

Less than a week later (which is last night/Sunday), I got a knock on my door from the local PD, who asked for the key back, he had 3 in his hands, so other neighbors also had copies. He mentioned she was getting them all back for her safety, and she was having her locks changed tomorrow (today now,.... Monday AM). I felt awful....my heart was in my throat. I stole her priceless familt heirlooms for around $900. She is in her 70's and her grandmother gave them to her. I also took some gold/diamond rings that looked older too. 
So this morning I called he and asked if I could stop by and talk for a minute - she obviously didn't know that it was me because she happily obliged even when she was in her robe/very vulnerable also kept apologizing for having the police stop by at 8PM on a Sunday Evening.

I talked to her, admitted what I had done, told her the business I sold them too and the date which I did it. I cried, and cried, and cried. I apologized profusely and told her I've never done anything like this - I don't have a criminal record. Aside from a few traffic tickets, I have never had any run ins with police. I knew I wasn't going to get away with it. I knew she would see it sometime soon, and I sold it to a shop, so they have pictures of what I sold, scanned my ID, took pictures of my ID, all the details of what I sold, ect.

I'm at rock bottom for me. I have not had a steady job in 18 months. My car probably needs $1300 in repairs - it still drives, but at any time could really need a repair. I don't have a cellphone.

Roughly 2 years ago I came clean to my wife 2 days after we put a $1000 good faith deposit on a home we were going to purchase.  2 days ago we put a $1500 god faith deposit on a house we want to purchase. I'm not sure what's going to happen. I ned help, I have a very bad problem.

I'm afraid I've just tossed out my wife & mines future......that I had a lapse in judgement, went on a bender, and ruined what little trst I had managed to build up with the woman who means more to me than anyone else in the entire world. I don't get why in that moment, it was more important t me to get that fix, than it was to ensure that I would continue building the trust of my relationship with my wife, to keep building a relationship with my neighbor.

 My wife is going to think that I care more about this awful drug than I do about her, our future, our family (pets...no kids), my love for her.Does anyone have any input/advice how I explain or bring this up in a way that I can tell her that she means more to me than anything in the world. Obviously actions speak louder than words, and my actions will have horrible replications for not just myself, but everyone involved. I need someone to talk to. I need help. I'm broken and I wat to get fixed, i want to fix myself th right way. So this never happens again. ",1460395984.0

Am I fine?,"tl:dr: my lawyer can't find me in the system and thinks i fell thru the cracks, yet some local station wrote a goddamn article about my arrest on their website. What be the deal? Should I expect to still get fucked eventually?

Late last November I was driving back from picking some dope late at night thru a town I've never lived in, and although I really wasn't very high at all, fucking with my phone had me swerving a bit and I got pulled over and the cop was somehow *certain* I was on something so he called the K-9, yadda yadda, then I'm arrested for heroin possession, some vyvanse and a DUI or DWI or whatever. And he might have tried to charge me for my subs since he didn't seem to believe I had a script, I obviously never found out shit. I spent the night in jail but eventually, my girlfriend came and posted bail and we immediately left and got my car from the lot of the place they called to tow my car. 

Thing is, no one ever told me what to do or what to expect, my immediate goal was just to GTFO. So when they told me bail was posted, I walked out. I've been expecting some other shoe to drop for a while, like maybe I'll miss the court date or I already did, because nothing was coming in the mail to me or my parents, who get their mail forwarded to them. However, when I called my dad's lawyer (same state, but not same city) he looked and said they could not find me in the system (whatever that means). He said its not unheard of to fall through the cracks, but I'm in disbelief and still worried. I mean, that *has* kinda happened to me once before and the only other time I've ever been arrested, but that was different (I won't get into that story here unless its relevant to anybody's life). We are talking about a felony heroin charge that I posted bail for, how can that fall thru the cracks in a medium-sized city?
 
*But*... part of why it still worries me they couldn't just forget is that as it turns out, a local radio station felt the people *deserved to know* about this major development and wrote an article on their website about my arrest complete with my full name and picture. I guess that's hard news, but after the country heals from this historic event, it still comes up when you search my fucking name. This is also how my parents also recently found out I've ever used drugs in my life, let alone IV heroin before I got back in a sub program, so... yay. (Side note, does anyone know how hard it is to change your name so I might have a chance at any decent job?) So if there's an online-article record of it, doesn't that kind of make it harder for the PD to ""lose"" record of it.

Also a friend recently told me I definitely should have had an arraignment shortly after the charges if anything was ever going to happen based on his legal run-ins, but I have no idea. And I've been pulled over since so I assume there's no warrant. My dad's lawyer (or my dad, IDR) said I shouldn't try to prepare by contacting a lawyer from that city because they might stir shit up and go reminding people just to get the billable hours. The bail wasn't cheap but I'm 100% willing to sacrifice that money to not have to tell employers I'm a felon. I'm in sub treatment now but i don't know how they expect low recidivism, especially for addicts, when you throw a felon tag on them.

So if anyone has any input or advice I would love to hear it, anything that might ease my mind or might more accurately prepare me for what to expect would be greatly appreciated. I'm especially interested in the opinon of /u/oh_no_five_oh or anybody that experienced something similar and what happened, but absolutely any thoughts or input would help. Its hard to believe that such a charge would just stop being a problem. And it seems like I have no real options other than the anxiety-inducing wait to see if I'm fine or if they can still fuck my shit up until the statue of limitations runs out.

I knew how scared I would be, I knew how regretful I would feel and still I did absolutely nothing to stop it. The last few months have been absolute hell.

I lost the love of my life in December, she thought I was clean but I know my heroin lies were the reason we ended. I don't think she knew about the lies but they were the definite underlying cause. I went on a 3 month bender to forget about her. Actually I've probably been on a bender for almost a year and I don't even realize it. Or I minimize it. I saw our breakup coming too.

I had a nice cushy job which was the longest I've ever held a job, 2 years, making really decent money that I literally just walked away from a few weeks ago. I walked because of depression and hurt and being unable to get out of bed without the fix that I couldn't get. I'm 2 months late on rent now and last week I let my dboy use my car in exchange for bags. I also knew what would happen if I let him use my car for so long. I have been calling him for 2 days straight now and his phone has been off. I wake up tonight at 1am and I look in the county jail roster and there he is, arrested for possession of a controlled substance. I'm guessing my car has been impounded.

So here I sit, I have absolutely nobody to help me. I was supposed to go get my son on Friday. I'm sorry buddy, daddy is a fuck up but I hope you never find out. I hope I will still be your hero. I have tears running down my eyes while I type this but I have nobody else to blame. I have no car, soon I will have no home. I don't even have a friend to crash with. I spent a lot of time building up what I earned. There is a small glimmer of hope. I will be receiving a 401k check soon of 600 and plus I believe I will be getting unemployment in a few weeks. Hopefully I can buy a car for 1000 and start working again or at least ride the bus to a job. I'm sure many of you have been in my shoes before.

you have access to a reasonable amount of heroin or any opiate of your choice. its clean, free of damaging cuts or bacteria, and you won't run out using say, a quarter gram a day. and its strong enough that even after months on that same dose, you only need to take slight tolerance breaks or use potentiators and smart dosing to keep your need to use more from rising.

you take care of your health, you get regular bloodwork, make sure everythings fine and dandy. sometimes you like to blast off on a friday night and do alot but this is somewhat rare and normally you can stick to your regular dose. your supply doesnt change much, so what you buy one week is the same as what you get next week. 


the people in your life dont know you use, or if they dont object to any major degree. when you travel you get on subs or methadone or you discreetly bring enough heroin with you to last. 

you are smart and lucky so you don't get caught by johnny law.... 
you keep pursuing your goals and aspirations still stay solid.

what the fuck are the downsides??? this is what im struggling with. heroin makes this emptiness i feel tolerable enough that i look forward to the next day. i get rally high quality heroin with few cuts in it, and whatever it is cut with is benign. i still live with chronic pain, the pain is there but taken down a notch so i can push myself to go stretching or running or liftng weights, and after that i feel soooo much better, more mobile, less pain. this constant buzzing in my head is replaced by my meditations on love, life, sex, fun, oy and how to help the world become a better place. 

i keep using like this for many years, 25 years until i die. i meet a wonderful women and have a family with her, i raise my kids right heroin is great to me. i can sedate myself when im angry and agressive (ptsd effects) , it takes away my pain. i know i dont NEED it. but god damn do i ever WANT it. i know a buddhist would say im just fishing for somethin to kill the aiand i produce art and follow my passions and help my loved ones a fulfilling life and kindness and sensitivity to other peoples suffering is are important aspects of this families collective life.

I never share my dreams either but I had to share this with the best community on reddit.

Im in a luxurious hotel with everything u can imagine, and it starts off me at a bank booth stack of cash exchanging 100s for 50s and 20s and a stack of ones, the bank teller was black and had a steve harvey comedic type of personality and I loved the bank teller. Then you go up stairs, where u pay money and its all amazing 10/10 girls only one can make up with imagination literally perfect hanging out naked, while its literally unlimited beautiful women its me and my closest homies / cousins etc. And of course they were prostitutes but they were a prostitute u'd marry if that makes sense

On the same floor there was so many booths, imagine a bank teller window with people in suits around and each both had a label for Opiates, Stimulants, Downers, etc. So I order up between 10/30/50/70 and 95% pure heroin and a needle (although I never shot in real life) and I get a huge bag and Im in a room getting undressed as a beautiful girl prepares the shot, another is undressing me. She shoots me up and I fall out and die only going deeper into a dream.

I wake up by getting narcanned in one arm, a gorgeous, sympathetic green eyed blonde giving me head, and oxycontin 80mgs being crushed with dunkin donut straws about and cocaine on glass trays.

So I sniff original 80mg OCs and cocaine and take bars and fuck for ever in unlimted orgy and this is just one door behind the countless in the floor I was on, in like a 40 story hotel. What I noticed, 80mg OCs everywhere like they were useless, which they were because pharmecutical grade heroin was prepared for you and IV'ed by again 10/10 nurses. All of this because I paid like 25 grand to get in and I could stay as long as I'd like. I died and came back 4-5 times all to a new girl blowing or riding me and either OCs gettiing prepared, or my favorite, getting narcanned and as soon as Im awoken I get hit again but I dont go out and all 3 women are with me all genuinely loving it. Green eyed / blue eyed beauties making eye contact giving me noggin

Finally I somehow get hungry after all this and leave, I go to one of the many booths where I get pizza fries and a ginger ale, I eat then stumble in another room where I see (at a side angle) my friend fucking this brunette, a russian or ukraine blonde with her finger in his ass, and a turny around his arm, and for some reason 1000x the amount of drugs were in his room versus mine

So I go to fill up my pockets with fucking heroin vials, 160mg oxycontins, opanas, cocaine, bars, and as I'm doing this my cousin notices and I wake up and take the longest piss ever. 

Im literally so sad, is this possible, imagine falling out and waken up to getting blown, narcanned, more unlimited drugs either be prepared for you or being injected as they pull the narcan needle out. Then when u get the benzo munchies u go to a booth and they have whatever food u can imagine, and everytime u die ur reborn in the middle of fucking a 10/10 woman, probably a billionaire to be living like that, and best of yet unlimited drugs, money, pussy, great food. No condoms.

Kill me, now I wanna relapse because this fantasy world felt so real, especially when I died and woke up fucking deeper in the dream (Inception shit) I wish I experienced more in the dream like daring to go up to a different floor to see what it was, instead I got my punishment because I greedily attemped to stuff OCs, heroin vials, and ounce bags of cocaine everywhere that my body would carry it, then my poor cousin looks at me in utter dissapointment, kind've an analogy like, ""your not suppose to take a shit ton more then u need with u at a time, now the dream is over, back to your miserable sober world"" Kill me I wish I had a bag of dope, but luckily clean time has earned me a clear mind and 650$ and success in college courses so I guess life is only 5% worth living opposed to 0%",1460512881.0

Short story regarding banging them, I couldn't register so I gave up. I didn't feel the risk was worth it. So I sprayed the shot under my tongue.... I downed the rest of the bottle. Now I am sitting here, waiting for something that I feel isn't going to come.

Basically I just got some xanax and made the mistake of mixing that with heroin this weekend. The whole weekend was a blackout and apparently I did some stupid shit. I told my brother and admitted I know what I did and I would never mix the two again. But my other brother, living in another country, couldn't keep to himself and had to let some guys from my church know.

Fast forward past dinner, these guys are now asking me about my addiction. Telling me it's time to kick. And I know it's time. But my plan was to taper down my heroin until withdrawals were minimal in a couple days. But nope. Heroin and xanax both flushed down the toilet (or so I presume) and I'm thrown into withdrawals overnight.

I made all of this sound like they're the bad guys but they're not. I am. I'm lazy and spending money I don't have on drugs and not paying rent and just fucking everyone else's lives up. These guys last night wrote me a check to help with rent and expenses and offered me a job opportunity with them. I was crying so hard last night, I couldn't believe it. I haven't cried in years. I didn't deserve this.

I can't wait to make it to the other side of the withdrawals. For now I guess I need to stay off this sub as much as possible. Good luck to us all.",1460496872.0

Were you able to cop or are you still sick as a dog with no way to get funds? If you did cop, was it just enough to get the tank off empty, or are you feeling awesome because you were able to afford enough?

How are you in general and what have you been up to today?


As for me, I'm feeling pretty damn awesome and that is rarity, so I'm trying to enjoy it it as much as I can, in my bedroom, alone. But I do have a full pack of cigs, and I just threw together a huge, delicious meal or fluffy white rice mixed in with stir fry broclli, peppers, squash, and all those good things, seasoned with black pepper, onion powder and garlic powder with two slices of shredded Munster cheese melted on top. And butter. So, *so* much butter. ‚ù§Ô∏è

So because I had a 10 hour shift today, I absolutely *100%* needed to get at least a little something to get me through that miserable fuckin day. So yesterday evening I went out and bought 2 grams. Last night before bed I did about a gram - Kinda pointless, I know- and then this morning before work I did a .6 shot... And when I got home today, I only had .4 left. A .4 shot isn't even enough for me to really feel a rush let alone get high recently- I might feel okay for 10-25 mins but just normal (as opposed to depressed as fuck)  and a bit carefree and excitable, that's all. 

So I'm like ""fuck!! I only have .4!!! What do I do?!""

So I remembered that I found several .25 Halcions in my room last week, that had been lost in there for maybe an entire year.

So I ate 2 Halcions- that's .50mgs  which is a moderate dose- and then I drank 12 ounces of beer; 11.6 % alcohol content by volume.

And then I did the shit after waiting for the Halcion and it was so great,I,can hardly describe this (but you all kno anyways lol)

Let's just say I'm high enough that I've been trying to type this shitty dumb post for over 30 mins now. And then once it looks perfect, I notice typos or whatever. Fuck it. Posting anyways before I nod again. I hope I did the thread correctly, Eh whatever peace!üå∏",1460493458.0

Well, around 5am we decide it's time to hit the hay, she slams 3 bags of the dope (I'm thinking it's cut with fent) and immediately she goes limp and she stops breathing. I freak out. I start slapping her and shaking her screaming at her to wake up. I start to run to my phone to call an ambulance but then I think... I'm a felon, on probation, and I'm already in hit water with my PO. There's a ton of dope everywhere. She's also getting fucked in court right now and if she were to mess up by doing something like this she would lose all her rights to see her daughter and her husband would cut all contact with her, not to mention if she is caught with drugs in her system she goes to jail for 3-5 years. So now I'm panicking. I move her so she is on her back on the couch and start doing my best at trying to do CPR which I'm just winging by doing what I've seen in movies. I breath into her mouth while plugging her nose 3 times then do chest compressions to the tune of ""staying alive"" by the fugees 3 times. I do this for 10 minutes and then check her pulse and her eyes (which are pinpoint and don't react to  flash light at all) and she starts to begin to breath on her own, but its shaky and stops after a minute or two. So I repeat the whole process for a half hour. Finally she inhales deep and her eyes pop open and she is terrified and confused. I get her up and run her to the shower and sit her down and run cold water and yell at her to keep awake and keep talking to me. Finally she starts to calm down and I realize she's alive and ok and she's not going to die.

Scariest time of my life. It may have been a mistake not calling the ambulance, because she easily could have died. But she's back at 100% right now and I couldn't be happier. Be careful, just because you can 2 bags and be fine doesn't mean you can do 3 safely. 


*edit* say what you want about me being a terrible friend for not calling an ambulance, I saved my friends life and also made sure she wouldn't lose her family and go to jail. She told me that she would have rather died than have been caught and lose the only thing that makes her life worth living.

I have not gone to the doctor in a while and I need my basic, annual check up. I haven't gone for a while now - probably like 2 years - because I have been using this whole time. The last time that I went, I was recovering from a decently long run of its own, and I remember feeling super embarrassed because when my OBGYN got down to business, she asked if I had ""skin discoloration"" because of the lingering scar tissue and whatnot.

Something to know about me is that I am a petite white woman, so my veins are awful and I have to poke over and over just to get a hit. I also have keloid scarring, which means that when I scar, it becomes all upraised and purple and ugly, and rarely goes away, if ever.

That last OBGYN appt revealed an abnormal pap, which means abnormal, possibly (probably) precancerous cells. I really need to see a doc.

My question is....how do I hide this shit?? How do you other ladies deal with stuff like this? Because I know that I am by far not the only person to realize that women have a MUCH harder time shooting up than men, thanks to our delicate soft lady skin and all that lol. So that must mean that at least some of y'all out there are dealing with the scarring and bruising issue.

Been shooting dope on n off 10 months or so, besides some dumb times early on(nothing too bad, cottons instead of microns, boilsed tap water) have always used the steri fit micron filters, freah rigs, etc. Am starting a kick this week, taking off with my mom to a nice cabin, she knows whats up, after that to a farm in northern idaho, than to explore in india, so yeah hopefully the kick takes(got safe environment, plenty of benzos clonidie etc) but the root of my question lies elsewhere
 i had had a red line running down my vein a week or so after havibg been shooting some crack, with the increased amt of pokes inflammed insides if veins. Two visits to doctor told me maybe minor phebitis, def not infected, use other veins etc. i switched to subs a good few weeks, things seemed fine, still scarring but not pain/redness etc and having used that vein since. Since then maybe a month or so been back on needle three weeks or so, not using super heavy and with good filters rigs etc. had sole knee pain at work(im a bike measenger) and got freaked out by a random story i heard of my friends mom who died in her 40's after knee pain that ended up being a deep veing tthrombosis. 

I know iv users and
Cig smoker(smoke sometimes heavily but once i, god willing, kick, smoke rarely) can be associated with blood clots and there certainly had to have been some clotting to heal some wounded veins.  I
do a decent job rotating and i have never shot in my legs. Im Young and exercise, and I find the pain def more noticable when thinking about it, doesnt seem to be getting better or worse. You read online of young cyclists dying of pulmonary embolisis from dvt, but i know theres massive selection bias in reporting since you dont hear of millions of times when guys knee hurt and it was nothing. So after this week im headed to rural idaho to work on a rad farm and to see friends and help me thru the rest of detox. Than on a trip to india for geneal exploration/adventure. i asked same questions to my physician last week and he said its very unlikely to be dvt and i should look for swelling but since i didnt shoot in legs its doubtful. Regardless, before going on long flight to rural areas should i try to get ultrasound or the other test for bloodclots? How easy is that to do, could i get it done at er ?whats a general time frame etc?

 Thanks so much for any info, sitting here having taken some alp, it goes in and out of being noticable and besides a week or so ago when i was riding  i dont notice when out nd about. Right now i hardly feel anything. Tho i know some dvt's present no symptoms. I thought doctors assurance would get rid of worry but still stressing about it(which can cause muscle cramps!!! Ahh lol vicious cycle)",1460609396.0

Ive had a monster habit of dope, as I commented in another threat, one of my ""last high ever"" involved about 1.2 to 1.3 grams of amazing, delicious, fire ECP. And .3 .4 of good yak snorted in the same line, it looked like I took a huge bong rip when I exhaled. (yeah yeah yeah I know, what a waste, bang that shit)

So since then my tolerance has dropped, even with a crazy high tolerance ive NEVER really had opioid induced constipation. (always trouble with pissing, but never pooping) until I went to ""rehab"" last week (more like the psych ward of a hospital)

So Im prescribed 24mg of subs, but I honestly take 2-4mg of it as thats all I need. For the 4 or 5 days locked in the psych ward (I couldnt leave) all I did was take my prescribed dosage of 24mg a day, eat like a king (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks) and drink sugary juice. Now I never eat breakfast, and mostly my ""lunch"" is also my 1 meal of the day dinner. But hey there wasn't shit else to do in that place so I was pushing the doctors for extreme around the clock ativan including IV ativan, (benzo munchies) and the food was good and you couldnt smoke cigs.

So I get home after I realized I havent shit for like a week, I was like okay its time to pop this guy out. Yeah I thought it would be a little painful, but I was wrong. I cried at the end, my ass still doesnt feel the same, and I whiped blood for days. It destroyed the toilet and was literally just a huge fucking ball of a rock with ripples, it just went so far in the toilet I didnt even see it but it was clogged for 2 days.

So yeah, wtf happened? I guess 24mg of subs a day x eating triple or quadruple my normal daily amount of food. Now Im so afraid to eat anything, I have laxatives / stool softeners on deck, and Ive been drinking probably 2 gallons of water a day ( I legit take like 2 minute long pisses ) and Im genuinely afraid everytime I go drop a deuce, I even cut my sub dosage back to 4mg every other day because of my fear.

So at the age of 30 I've played many roles in this game we all love so much; ""casual"" user of OC80s because when I started on them 10 years ago they were so fucking cheap and easy to get in the dirty south that supply/finances weren't an issue until 2010 when Purdue switched them lol

I've flipped and slung smaller amounts of things ranging from weed for a nice good run, up to H  (I'd say mid-level at my most exaggerated kingpin levels lmao, never had the balls to move up to weight that would make me a full-scale distribution operation or anything, but definitely way bigger on the chain than a glorified middle lol) at various times as well 

Anyway, I've used benzos recreationally even before I got turned onto the OG 80s because I got scripted them for panic attacks the summer after HS. I've had a long illustrious career with never getting prescribed bars except ONE TIME when I got scripted 5 by a doctor in Sacramento when I got stuck there cuz of a plane delay and it totally fucked up my Xanax-airplane-sleep supply situation and I went to a walk in clinic the next day before my flight and he gave me 5 bars lmao. I took them to a non-chain pharmacy and got 5 GG249's

I've had hookups for bars thatve been steady for 6mos-2years at a time even. Countless disgusting green monsters- SO MUCH POWDER!, yellow school buses which I like very much, and the ever-present GG249s that were definitely the majority of any bars I've ever taken. And another generic that was white, but I barely remember it and I think whoever was making it stopped for some reason 

But tonight, I got 10 motherfuckin *brand name* Xanax bars with the Xanax on one side and ""2"" on the other. From the pharmacy, not from some rando dealer, and I definitely examined the imprints/consistency and after chewing up a very small piece and being overjoyed at how disgusting the alprazolam was in my mouth, I'm now so barred out that imma get a lot of shit for this shit post

And guess what?? I don't caaaaare! Lol. Cuz I'm a super duper old man, elderly even, and god damn it I'm allowed to be excited about my brand name Xanax! I have always kinda viewed them as an urban legend despite billions of pictures plus every single person on planet earth having had tried them EXCEPT ME haha. It was like I was crazy or something

Anyway, hope y'all are safe tonight it's rainy and gross here, but this xan xan is sweeeeeet!!! Haven't had any benzos in over a week cuz I'm an idiot and mixed up my refill date like an idiot haha. So it's also nice to satisfy that addiction- I'm gonna sleep sooooo well tonight! Luckily despite my super high-mg prescription, I don't seem to suffer any benzo WDs except maybe trouble sleeping the first 1-3 nights depending on other factors

So on Friday I will be running into the usual problem - I will be ""out of medicine"" tomorrow (Thursday, 4/14) but need to be social, positive, and energetic on Friday. I will be unable to get any more medicine before then. I stocked up on blues on Monday to last me through the weekend, but like always I underestimated how much I would consume. 

On Friday I am attending a career-related event (a ""research symposium"" for my field) and will be meeting with important people in a setting meant for networking. 

I will be out of blues, but by random chance I happen to have two (2x) Subutex, 8mg. I have done suboxone, which worked completely to remove WD's back in the day so well that I actually quit for 2 years - so I have experience with the synthetic stuff meant for ""treatment."" I have read that it only requires a very small amount of an 8mg to catch a buzz. What is the nausea I read about with subutex? Will I catch an actual buzz, or just be *not sick* ? Are there any common tips for using subutex? 

I would consider my current tolerance 7/10. I have been blowing about 3 blues a day for the past 3 days. Tomorrow (Thursday) I will only be doing 1x blue, and then the sub's on Friday. For my history, I have about 5 years under my belt and have used every RoA, with almost every type of opiate.


Thanks for taking the time to read this. I hope all of yall are doing well and catching a decent nod. I really enjoy reading this sub.

As someone who has lived in Alaska for several years but recently moved back to the lower 48, let me confirm that yes H is super expensive up north. So why would us Eskimos pay $80 for a point of tar? Allow me to explain, and give some insight on what it's like to get high in the last frontier.

**ITS FUCKING COLD**

Seriously, before I moved to Alaska I thought I was a ""winter person"". I love snowboarding, skiing, snowmobiling, climbing, hiking all that good stuff. But once your up there in the dead of winter and it's cold as fuck 24/7 shit gets old fast, which is where opiates come in. 

Many jobs in Alaska pay very well compared to jobs in the states to attract bums like me who have no direction in life and don't mind freezing their ass off, so a lot of people have money for the expensive drugs and not much else to do with their spare time besides build igloos and hunt polar bears. Sustaining a habit given the exorbitant prices is a different story, but for somebody with little tolerance and the discipline to limit their usage a gram of good tar goes a long fuckin way. 

**the scene is SKETCHY as fuck** 

I have copped in many ghettos and big cities but Alaska was definitelu the sketchiest place I've ever seen with regards to the dope game. Making connections is very nerve racking given the small number of users and dealers, cops are always undercover and judges are harsh. There is no open air game, to score dope your best bet is a hooker or one of the few homeless guys if the weathers nice. 

Given the crazy prices most addicts either middle (ripoff), rob people, or sell to support the habit. Most dealers and users are also tweakers which doesn't help things one bit. Mofos are 24/7 paranoid and strapped to the nines in case a junkie robs them for a $350 gram. I knew this one crazy bitch who robbed a lot of people at gunpoint for meth and tar until she went to jail, and after she got the drugs she would go on a massive solo bender of goofballs (meth + tar shots) until all the drugs and money were gone. A true trap queen...

But any ways, I proceeded to crush half the pill after scraping off the coating and racked that half. Waited 30-45 min or so and wasnt really feeling much so I ended up taking the other half orally. Needless to say, I wasnt too impressed and came to the conclusion I would take 3 roxi's over an OC 80 no doubt; not only due to the feeling but the roxi's weren't as expensive either.

I started off this time around in (a large metro area in Northern TX) , staying with a friend of mine there who had a solid tar hookup through the Mexicans. Went up to (a mile high city in Colorado) where there's one of the last actual open air markets, copping from the Hondurans. Down to (a big city in NM), which is the home of some of the best tar I've ever seen in eleven years of this lifestyle. (Top three at least, right up there with (the most southwestern city in the continental US) and (a large city in Oregon) ). Back to (same Texan metro area) , then (two cities on the 35 in Texas) with the freshly imported tar straight from the border. Crossed the Mississippi River into (a city in Louisiana with a history of voodoo and piracy) and the land of powder, wasn't very impressed although I had heard about how dangerous the dope there is supposed to be. Now I'm in (a big city in North GA featured in a lot of rap songs) , found some really solid connects, but I'm moving on to (a city in Maryland just north of our nation's capital) tomorrow to try the scramble I've heard so much about.

I recently got out of the hospital for an OD / detox / unable to leave the psych ward and my professor of psychology asked about what happened and I told her everything while we smoked cigarettes after class. Now two weird things happened. 1. She asked me to chime in when we speak of substance abuse next week, which I really don't want to, but now I feel like its a strange obligation, as I only speak merely once a month or so and when I do its usually to drop some clever or witty knowledge.

2. I went to sleep at 6 A.M and woke up at 8 A.M for class at 9, the few days before I lacked sleep as well. I really didn't want to go so I used my suboxone as a crutch and dosed 4mg early in the morning when I usually dose afternoon/evening. So I nodded all class, not high but I couldn't keep my eyes opened. Of course, a few days ago I told my teacher Im addicted to heroin. So she kept looking at me all class and surely thought I was nodding off dope.

Fuck me, right? Luckily class ends in 3 weeks and I just hope this retardation doesn't affect my grade. I realized a part of why I love class so much is because Im a part of a group of people who don't know about my addiction and can only judge me from appearance / my input during class (I bet the professor must've though, thats why he always wears a hoodie or long sleeves!)",1460694491.0

I'm writing this to get some advice but also just to keep me occupied and not anxious. I have a lot of experience with opiates, but am most seasoned with oxy IR and poppy seed tea. If I've been taking a lot of oxy (haven't regularly for a while but found some 3 or so weeks ago and maxed around 90 mg because I only bought 9), then my tolerance will go up and I can take a lot of it. 

Anyway, I'll try to be succinct here. I can also handle my poppy seed tea. My old source was bunk so I bought some from another popular site named after a slow moving aquatic animal. As always, despite the fact my last batch was so weak and the fact that I took 35 mg of oxy on tuesday, I did a test batch. You can never be too careful. I did about 200 G and didn't use any lemon because I didn't have any on hand. I drank it at about 830 AM and did a second wash. Usually with good seeds (which these appeared to be based on lots of powdery residue and poppy straw - and most of all, that smell that you just know when you smell it) it doesn't matter how you make it. You can throw your dose in a bottle, add some cold water, give it a few minutes of lazy shakes, and get fucked up. 

Anyway, I have classes today and so I figured I would do a calibration tests of sorts so I know what I'm working with when I do a full dose. Based on the smell, and my recent unique experience of using a popular amazon vender which was strong enough that 200 g's got me high for like 24 hours, I only dosed 200 grams. 

It started off weak, but now around 4 hours have gone by and I'm pretty damn noddy. I keep taking my heart rate, the lowest its gotten is 63 BMP. That being said, if I didn't have a class in 2 hours and wasn't obligated to be aware (playing video games on a couch, for instance) I would probably be in and out a lot. I happened to take a bit of adderall for ADD about 30 minutes ago, but didn't wanna take too much because of the old speedball risk where when the opies ware off you can overdose. 

Anyway, I'm more noddy than I anticipated, and since my resting heart rate is normally very high (up to 80 BMP or more) the 60ish bmp is scaring me. I'm not at all nauseous, if I focus, etc. I can stay awake. But I don't know I just want to be safe. I know its a very subjective question, but is there a certain heart rate I should look out for? I know then when it gets too low, or you are in danger you probably can't even take your own pulse, and you're probably asleep. 

I really don't think this warrants going to the hospital to get narcan. I also (obviously if your life is in danger then this doesn't matter) but I don't want to deal with insurance and all the other bullshit that would occur from going to get narcan. I feel like the fact that I'm typing this (relatively) articulate message should mean that I am ok. But as I write this if I get tired and close my eyes I might nod off for half a minute or so, when I come back from the nod is when my heart rate gets down to 60, whereas if I'm awake and thinking about this or something else is closer to 75. 

Any tips or suggestions? I know this is kind of silly because if I had any doubt I should call 911. That being said, I have no nassau or anything, my lips aren't blue, etc. I just got higher than I expected, I'm itchy as fuck, nodding and my pupils seem way too small for the dose that I took. Normally this would be good, and my anxiety is a bit higher simply because I made the silly choice to do a test dose on a school day. Either way, its probably good that I did, because I didn't want to take too much while in class and if I had done this before my only class on friday I would have taken more which could have definitely been too much.
