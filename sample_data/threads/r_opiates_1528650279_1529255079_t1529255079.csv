Today is my last day of a week long bender (roughly 20mg of panda a day, and maybe 5-8 bags a day).  But alas my gf is about to return from the World Cup and normal life must resume.

Now the last time something like this happened (blew through like 10 buns in a week and a half) I took my sub a little too early (even at 24 hours I guess) and I ended up going through 3 days of sweating my ass off and being completely immobile. 

Well, now that she has watched the second season of 13 reasons why she is well aware of what wd looks like and I need to do it better this time at my transition from this little bender to my subutex  Maintenance.  

I was thinking about saving and doing 2 bags tomorrow (one in morning and one at night) to get my tolerance down a little and then waiting a full 24 hours until dosing my first sub.  As the last time going from a full dose to waiting 24 hours somehow put me into pwd ... which I absolutely cannot have.

Anyone have any suggestions on how to minimize wd in this scenario?  I get prescribed 16mg a day of subutex, along with a myriad of benzos (back injury / anxiety)

Also, I do Amphetamine in very high doses daily, sometimes to the point where I shake, despite taking Lamotrigine. I know that if I mix Amp and Tramadol I may get seizures. But if I tell doc, that I use my nose as a vacuum cleaner, he most likely would not prescribe me anything funny.

So, how to approch my doc, to prescribe me a good painkiller, that isn't Tramadol (I am in Poland and are going to a private doc, but they do some shit about prescribing stronger opioids, since they require a different prescription).",1529243780.0

But after that I felt a lot better. It felt like my stomach had returned to its former state, before the opiate abuse.

Just a thought. Im sure there are others suffering from stomach problems.",1529202853.0

When I was 13 I wandered into what I thought was an abandoned trailer. 

To my surprised Cinderella was inside. 

Standing behind her was Steve Harvey. 

But between them was a read headed step child probably 12. In the child's hand was a bottle of robitussin. Name was Geebie. 

The kid took a swig as Cinderella did a line of blow and took a shot of whiskey. Jack Daniels. 

Steve Harvey looked at me. ""Welcome to my trailer bitch"". He snarled. 

Confused I pulled out my meth pipe. 
""Y'all ever heard of the 4 stroke gang?"" 

Steve took the pipe from me. Took a long hit. 
Blew it out. His penis became so sensitive he started splooging everywhere.

He then beat the red headed step child. Spanked Cinderella and then stared deep into my soul. ""Your next white boy"". 

I ran. Faster than I ever could. He chased me. Fully erect. The meth made him fast. But my 13 year old legs were stronger. 

I escaped. Thankfully. That was the night I met Cinderella.",1529202538.0

8rnujb,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8rnujb/middles_how_does_your_middle_benefit_from_getting/,7,https://redd.it/8rnujb,TheLemurMaster,"Middles, how does your middle benefit from getting your stuff for you?","I broke a two year sub assisted sobriety in April. Before I got onto subs my drug of choice were pills, mostly oxycodone. They were so freakin expensive so usually I could only afford to take 60-100mg a day. I started on 6mg sub, tapered to 4mg then broke my arm. When I broke my arm badly the doctor upped my dosage to 24mg a day hoping to help me avoid going onto full agonist pain killers. My arm healed but I did not taper and I began to take way more than prescribed. I'd always end up short at the end of the month and would buy some subs at super high prices from a few people I knew. 

In April I ran out two weeks early. No one I knew had enough to sell. I tried to cut my dose down but I would always take more than I rationed figuring I would ""start tomorrow, just 4mg tomorrow for a few days then 2mg and I'll make it to my refill date"".

I didn't have any way to get oxy. I was so out of the game. Finding a hook up was a miracle. I didn't cold cop. I cant say exactly how I found a new middle, but I did.

After a week or two of messaging back and forth we finally made the meet up. He told me $100/g and I told him I'd like a gram and that I would give him $100 for helping. I still had money to spare, so that wasn't a problem. The whole thing went down smoothly. I got home, weighed the bag and it was only .7g. I decided not to say anything because I thought maybe that is how it goes. Usually coke is sold in $50s around here and its .7g despite the dealer calling it a g. 

I had taken my last 6mg of sub 12 hours before and I started my journey into fent dope with the tiniest bump worried that I could possibly OD immediately from this super powerful substance. Nothing much happened. Naturally I still had plenty of buprenorphine holding tight onto my receptors. After a few hours I did reach a state of well being. The stress of mild sub withdrawal was lifted. It was nice. I saved the rest for work the next day and on the way home asked my middle if I could get a $150. No problem he said, it was like he was just waiting for me and was ready. Another smooth transaction. I get home and weigh it, this time it was 1.4g, close enough to 1.5g. It also had what appeared to be and tasted like crushed up Xanax. There were these soft bluish bits, one was quite large. This dope also appeared to be much stronger. It really hit me, wonderful euphoria. That was it, the hooks were in me, my relapse was complete.

As time went on the quality of the dope went up and down. Also the weight of the bags went wild. I am not sure exactly what my middle does in order to benefit from getting me dope. Sometimes the bags would be HUGE but the quality was shit. Like one time he gave me 6g for $200 and it was absolute garbage. 

Early in our relation while I was in the worst withdrawal I had ever experienced he gave me something totally bunk. I thought that was it, he decided to burn me and burn the bridge. I texted him just to say it isn't doing anything. I expected no response. To my surprise he was also in the same boat. I turned around and within an hour he got me a new bag of some real fire. It got me high as a kite and bolstered my faith in him as a trustworthy middle.

For a few weeks everytime I bought a ""gram""  or ""2 grams"" the bag(s) would actually be 2-2.5g and most of the time very high quality. I wasn't understanding how he was benefiting from me. Sometimes though the bag would be soooo much and the powder of a more granular consistency and a much lower potency. I wondered if he was scooping some out and putting regular sugar in it.

More recently though the bags have now returned to be just one gram. The quality is immensely better but it's very rare for it be much over. I guess I can't complain. I got used to taking higher doses because my gram bags were two grams. Now I am doing 2-4 grams a day if I can afford it. It's a very tough day if I have to make it through on just a gram. Fentanyl has no legs at all.

I am very nice and itchy and noddy right now though, and that's why I wanted to right the story. Just a few days ago he was giving me deals like 2g for $130 so I got all these deals and did 2-3 grams a day. Then yesterday I go and spend $200 and the bag is only 1.8g. It was the strongest I have had yet but fuck. I let him know and today gave him $160 and he gave me 2g. That bag weight is all over the map. He must be scooping some out and yesterday scooped too much. So I imagine he benefifs from either grabbing a few points or charging a little more than his guy charges. He also middles for a few other people so maybe his guy hooks him up due to him bringing so much business. Sometimes I give him some extra money, give him a bunch of cigarettes or let him use my credit card to get gas or food.

At the end of the day he's a great middle and performs me a good service. I really really need to stop though. I went back on my suboxone for 3 days last week, I thought I would make it. Now I'm high as hell on fentdope. I am such a world of shit financially, such huuuuge problems. I have to face the music tomorrow when I run out of dope and have no money for anything. wish me luck guys",1529199315.0

That same night this girl (who we'll call L) emailed us saying she could get us a hookup. Because we were broke we couldn't do it but we stayed in contact just in case. As a thank you for offering to help I told L if she needed a favor she could ask us and we'd see what we could do. 

Last night she asked if we could help her because she was out, broke, and sick. Unfortunately we were in the same boat, but I said I'd see what I could do. Later that night I found a MS Contin 30 but by the time I tried to call she was asleep (we were still sick but because we don't shoot it wouldnt even get us well). 

This morning our dealer called and said he needed a favor (because he doesn't have a car and he knows we've been struggling financially we have an arrangement where we'll give him a ride, deliver dope, drop off his dry cleaning, etc, and he'll throw us a .50 and some gas money). 

So we do the favor, get our bag, and I just started feeling really terrible that this girl, who I've never met, never even seen her face, was suffering through withdrawals. I put aside about .2 and told her I could help. She doesn't have a car so she said I'd have to meet her. I'm low on gas, have no cash, but the thought of this girl suffering, or going out and blowing some guy to get cash wouldn't leave my mind. 

I drove down there, waited for 25 minutes because her ride was late, and gave her the dope and the morphine. She was so happy she broke into tears. I'm not making this post to be all ""check me out I'm a generous saint"", just trying to remind you guys that we're all in this together. Sure, a lot of people are dicks who will take advantage of as many people as possible, but the vast majority of us are just struggling to get by. It doesn't take giving someone a gram for free to help them, even something small can help.

Edit: While everything in the post is written in the first person my SO was in this with me the whole way. She feels the exaxt same way I do about the situation. 

Edit 2: Whether you do or do not believe in Karma, something interesting happened today. I just lost my job so I've been looking for odd jobs anywhere I think I'll find one. I made posts on Facebook, Craigslist, Next Door, etc, explaining my story and offering to do jobs for people. I get a few replies with the usual stuff (landscaping, general labor, minor construction) which I'm more than happy to do and it seemed my luck was slightly turning around. Just slightly. 

About 20 minutes after I got home from meeting L I get a response that's just this gentleman's name and phone number. On the phone he tells me he's essentially a professional handyman and that the amount of business is growing faster then his current group can handle. He said he'd love to meet me, and if he likes the first impression I have a job. Basically we're going to meet and talk a little, then I start working almost immediately to see if I'm fit for the work. He asked what my ""current asking rate is"" and I told him at my old job I was making $11.40/hr and I'd like to be making a little bit more than that. He counter offered with $15/hr, 50 hrs/week, paid daily. ",1529196306.0

I typically use heroin but my girl just recently picked up oxycodone and im not really getting anything out of it... she got 20mg lil blue(grey) ones i think they said k 57 on them, the first day i snorted 15mg and got a nice little itch and felt pretty good at first then fell asleep and woke up to try the same thing and literally felt nothing. I snorted another 10mg and still felt nothing.

I gave up and snorted some boy and barely even felt that too!

Im confused because I know my tolerance for boy is manageable and I don't really ever have to increase my dosages by much if any and I try my best to keep it low as possible but now my tolerance or something got all fucked up maybe my nose just wont absorb it anymore or something idk.

I guess my point to this is is there anything I can do to increase the bioavailiability? i know snorting isnt the best but i figure ill atleast get high from the drip and a little bit of rush cause i love the drip and act of crushing/snorting...
And does tolerance rapidly increase with oxies versus heroin?

Tried killing myself, went on all sorts of medications(anti depressants etc), therapy i did everything. Even got in very good shape( ripped, shredded with 6 pack abs) but the depression just never got better. took a shit ton of benzos and painkillers and did a half ass attempt at killing myself. i can't keep a job, the second i get money i spend it all on drugs. so those 3 years were me living at my dads.

I don't really chase an extreme high it's mostly i take enough to get a mood lift but that is never sustainable. doing it for so long the mood lifts only last ike two hours. So even though i'll only do like 30 mgs in one shot. if i have them i'll end up doing 200 mg's in one day.

i don't know what to do anymore, i cannot live sober, i did my best and tried very hard. i can't live life on pain killers because i go broke and lose my job to fast. I think about killing myself 24-7.

what the hell should i do? Get on methadone or subs for life? something to just barely tickle my opi receptors long half life where i don't feel like killing myself all day? Right now the only road seems to lead to my death.

Or even weirder, you‚Äôll have your eyes closed nodding and you will still visualize what you think is in front of your closed eyes, clear as day but obviously a bit more hallucinogenic.
I have however noticed there is very little open eyes visuals, however. That‚Äôs so weird that there would be such intense CEVs, I highly suspect it‚Äôs due to the molecules structural similarity to phenethylamines (like MDMA and 2C-B) as well as it having a 4 hydroxy group attachment much like our friends DMT and Psilocybin.


This drug is seriously underrated! And not only does it give classic opiod euphoria (especially when plugged.. DONT snort! Will burn bad!), but it also has these crazy nodding hallucinations created out of your collective memories of recent. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôd close my eyes to nod then a minute later I could make out my wall and blanket and be like ‚Äúwait I thought my eyes were closed‚Äù only to open them and find I was right, and most of the time my open eyed visuals (normally, non-hallucinations) were nowhere near where I was convinced they were based on what I saw with eyes closed. But I didn‚Äôt just hallucinate stuff that‚Äôd been within my sight shortly before nodding, I also witnessed serene landscapes and entities. Like some DMT or high level acid trip shit üòù it was wild


And yet another unique property of this opiod- it almost even seems to produce GABA or GABA-like activity because it can make me stumble, feel very dreamy and forgetful as well..
And at 0.65¬¢ For 100 mg doses from india (i only took 125 mg and tripped/nodded sack, this may be the great new opiod.


*protip: This shit still works even if you have that implant or whatever that keeps you from feeling classic opiods like heroin*",1529176224.0

So I go in, place is filled with people  so Mr.traphouse suggests we go upstairs so we can do our business in private. He give me 6 .2 baggies and in the hand off one is dropped. I start looking around for it on the bathroom floor while he goes to grab some more boy to make up the difference and all of a sudden the door gets closed and I am now cornered by a 6‚Äô 5‚Äù junkie with a massive kitchen knife and he‚Äôs trying to rob me/force me to buy his clearly fake drugs. I make it very clear I‚Äôm not interested and need to leave. I try to pass him and manage to get the door open.

He says ‚ÄúI ain‚Äôt no gangster, but right now I don‚Äôt give a fuck. You aren‚Äôt leaving this bathroom till I have everything on you‚Äù so I pulled out a 20 and tell him that‚Äôs all I have left after copping my shit. He isn‚Äôt having it.

And I am booking it for the front door with Knife Boy hot on my tail. Everyone starts screaming to stop ME! Mr.Traphouse is on the porch and blocks me from getting outside. So I yelled ‚Äúthis dudes trying to rob me with a knife‚Äù Knife boy holds up the knife and denies such a thing happening. Mr.Traphouse pistol whips him out cold. Happened so fast I jumped. He goes in his pockets, get me my 20 and breaks me off a half gram of boy and a half gram of hard. Then he walks me to my vehicle apologizing the whole way.

I actually thought it was long lost, but after searching around quite a bit, I found some old notebooks, and thankfully, this was one piece I had in there.  Much of the stuff I lost was due to typing up pieces, only to have a hard drive crash without having backed things up properly.  I ended up going back to pen and paper shortly after that happened, though I haven't had the inspiration to write anything in years, hence sharing older stuff.  I wrote it back in '03, I remember quite well.  I hadn't been using terribly long, was all about some 80s, and had just discovered a lot of the guys that would become personal favorites, like Whitman, Thoreau, and Emerson.  I'm sure I was probably trying to emulate them somewhat, which isn't to say I actually succeeded lol.  But, it was weird revisiting the piece years later, just because, while I hadn't been using long enough to be a full blown addict, I could see the road I was headed down in retrospect, just seeing where my mind was at the time.  Anyway, enough introduction...)


As I solemnly stroll through the barren field

Serene as it may seem

The field is filled with all I've killed

Crushed hopes and broken dreams

--

And where do I lie

In this hazily constructed area

It occurs to me

How strange all of this is

Others see me clearly

Perceived as quite askew

Though I can see nothing

As I peer from an obstructed view

Yet still I hope to find that line

The line that is straight

Which I'm obviously not used to

--

Most of my exploits

Involved a path quite jagged

Justifying how I ended up in this mess to begin with

--

It seems every turn to take in this field

Leads to the wrong place

Either that or I'm led back to the beginning

Which is equally as frustrating

--

Because then

I have to once again

Face all of these obstacles

Constantly growing exponentially

As many aspects of me continue to fade away

--

Not quietly, as the setting sun

But rather viciously

Like a child being scarred for the first time

--

They can only fade for so long

Until their existence ceases altogether

And if at that point

I have yet to make it through this field

I'll be forced to wander aimlessly

For an eternity, or perhaps longer

--

But at this point it is hard to tell

What I am searching for

Hopefully I could find some of the things I've lost

And possibly revive some that I've killed

--

Although I was seeking an end to this maze

I suppose in the end

To find the happiness I've misplaced

Could be better than any other imaginable outcome

--

So I begin again

Back to the front, tabula rasa

Unsure of where to start

Like a newborn attempting to learn to speak

With no one around to help teach

--

I catch a glimmer in the far distance

So I follow the bright light

I believe at one point in time

I was told that this was a viable option

--

But the longer I walk toward the light

The farther away it appears

--

Logic would tell one to rethink the plan at this point in time

But there is no time for that

So I continue walking, trusting my instincts

For that is all that I'm left with

Because I have lost everything else

Somewhere in this damn field

And with no clue where to look

This bright light must be an omen

--

So I muster up any vigor that remains

In this former shell of myself

And try to find my way amongst all this treachery

To the shining light

--

This time, however, as I begin approaching the light

It does not seem to distance itself from my onslaught

In fact, it is locked in place at this point

Statue-esque as if struck by Medusa herself

--

""A-Ha!""

I say to myself

""This time I've got the little bastard""

--

So I begin to run

Sprinting with all my might

Toward this shining light

And while its mobility may have been nullified

A feeling of terror still encompasses what remains of this mortal coil

--

As I approach this time

The light becomes increasingly dimmer

And the closer I get

The quicker it fades

--

I begin to wonder if this journey is even worth the time

Though my other options are quite limited

Or rather nonexistent, if you must

--

As I make it to the location of the light it has completely faded

And all is dark again

--

Just as I begin to ponder

Any possibility of escaping this predicament

All of my concerns soon become irrelevant

--

The darkness emitted this light to lure me in

As nonchalantly as a fisherman

--

And just like that fisherman

Now that it has grasped me

And has me for its own

Everything that I know matters no more",1529140270.0

Been using four years and always gone through the same few people. But they're an hour away and gas is getting to be pretty expensive since I'm going out every night. So on my way out to go pick up a gram as I was getting gas I saw someone get out of a car, walk to another car, drop something off and walk back, so I drove round, cut him off and was like what's up can you get black? 

He was like ""yeah man for sure go park over there I'll be over there in a second'

Came over and was like 'homegirls in the bathroom in the store right there, just give me the money and I'll run over and grab it"" 

Every instinct was telling me don't let your fucking money walk but the prospect of having a connect not one minute from my house spoke over my instincts and lo and behold he ran inside came back out said 

""hey man you got a scale"" 

""Not on me"" 

""No worries I've got one in my car.""

 
Dude tapped my car walked back to his car sat for few minutes and then drove the fuck away with the lights off

(AKA middle man used phone to call plug and left number on there),"Hi all, if you were a dealer, would you be happy for a new customer? I mean i know there are people who would be happy to get a new customer to make $$$$, but then there are some who get sketched out easily.

The situation is kind of like this, found out a coworker also does dope. Powder dope is more rare and costs more. 'China White' is all my coworker buys and does. He only snorts, where i use rigs and tar since most of my area all I've had luck finding is tar. After finding out he used, we'd drive up sometimes to cop. My tar dude lives a few miles away from his guy so we'd just share a ride sometimes. I would get my tar, he would get his China. He kept telling me to try it so I did one day. It was definitely a different feeling. The Tar would keep me well longer, but the rush from the China was a different type of rush, kind of more euphoric in a way. 
Anyways, so since trying it, I've started to throw in money a few times to get something from his guy. But some reason I suspect he tries to pinch it no matter what, even when I get a dub. It's ironic because  whenever my coworker will get a dub for himself, it will look extra fat, but whenever i throw in money to get a dub, it'll be extra small. Like maybe twice when i couldn't go up, i've asked for a half G and he'd bring me back something I thought was a .5, but after seeing his sacks, it would look like a dub his dealer gives him. i don't have a scale so I never knew. 
ANd this is everytime, when only he gets something from his guy, it looks fat, but everytime i throw in for something, he'll say that's just what he gave him and i'tll be mad small. 
My coworker also doesn't have a phone so he uses mine when we go up together and always deletes the number after. But 2 days ago, he left the number in there while he went outside and i wrote the number down before he deleted it after he came back in.

So i have the guys number, but i don't know his name. My coworker did a good job of making his connect avoid coming to the car as well. Liek everytime, I've dropped him off like 20 feet away or he'd alway get out of the car to walk to his guy. Now I know why. So I don't think he's ever seen my face before, but possibly my car. I could keep getting tar, but i want to try something new, if you guys were in my situation, how would you guys try to reach out to the China plug? Or would you even try? I don't know if my coworker was trying to scare me or not, but he said never go down there alone. He said dudes down there will just take ur money if they don't know you and just say, 'what money'? , but i'm sure if i can make myself out to be a steady customer that will bring steady cash flow, he'd be happy for that, no?",1529116708.0

My wife and I decided it's going to be best to drive back since 4 plane tickets (wife, son, myself and dog) would cost quite a bit more for tickets to get there and back, as well as renting a car for 2 months. We'll make the drive in 3 long days, staying in two hotels. The whole trip will only cost about $600-$700. I mean...it's definitely not money im stoked about putting out. But hey, it's the best option at this point.  
  
Thank you all for the advice and kind words, and just telling this douche bag how wrong he/she is and what an asshole he/she is.  
bro clearly you're too incompetent to understand my original post. Thus being the reason you replied with such negative, ignorant, and useless things to say. I didnt blame anyone...my lawyer actually did a pretty good job, seeing as how i only have to do 4 months when the minimum is 2-5 years and it's not my first offense in that state.  
  
Yea, i made quite a bit of a problem for myself. Again, since youre too stupid to retain anything you read...ill repeat it. This happened over 2 years ago. My child is 2.5, the case is 2.5 years...can you do basic math? I dont need to explain to you my choices in life. Im sure a lot of us (except you apparently, you must be a saint) have made bad decisions in life. I just happen to be paying the price for one of mine years down the road.  
And ill repeat this as well, even though numerous other people told you already...im only upset with my lawyer for not getting back to me over a month ago when he first knew about this. I could have 2 months to plan this out...instead I have 2 weeks. But im done with your stupid ass. Have fun being a moron IRL.  
Oh yea, and if anyone else has ever had to do any jail time in California...you will probably know what it's like. It blowwwws big time compared to any other state ive been to. I mean the prison politics that trickle down into jails is so shitty. Being white and having no choice but to run with the peckerwoods (whiteboys) im kinda forced into the lifestyle while im there.  
**Just a little bit of that life is something like this:**  
No talking to blacks, or other races  
Most certainly do not eat food they have touched  
No drinking from the water fountain that other races use.  
If a black used a toilet that im about to use before me...i have to spray and wipe it clean.  
I'm forced to work out with woods (whiteboys) twice a day in case a fight breaks out. (The OG peckerwoods control this, and want you to be beefed up, pretty much as a soldier for the whites)  
  
That's just a little of the prison politics. It fucking sucks, i dont live that way in real life...dont care to at all. But in there its different. You kind of have to, or you'll be a loner and when shit hits the fan, which it does a lot in this place...you'll be alone, and you dont want that to happen.  
It's unbelievable how barbaric they live in there, i dont get it. If i was lucky enough to go back at a time that the facility im speaking of is wayyy too full, ill luck out and spend my time in regular county jail. This is a jail turned into a prison. But it's a prison that happens to be ran by the county sheriff's dept. instead of the state like normal state pens.

Just like I can't judge you based on a few paragraphs or stories - you can't judge me because of what I have to on a opiates related forum. I don't sit and judge anyone here. I find mutual respect is the best medicine. **I kindly ask that any critiques given are constructive and not downright mean.** I'm really trying to improve here and am taking the first steps towards that.

5 Days Sober, Let's Restart
===

Just working on my life now. I have several job potentials in my email plus I'm meeting with a counselor Monday. They require 3 recovery meetings a week along with 9 hours worth of recovery group work weekly. We'll see if this program is a fit for me. It's covered by my insurance - their inpatient is not. Either way, I'm just picking up the pieces and starting over. The recovery AA/NA or SMART meetings are way outside of my comfort zone. They're just emotionally triggering so I have a friend that's willing to take me to my first meeting hopefully it goes well, we'll see. 

The Pain is Real
===

I have a real pain problem. Even the counselor today asked if I was still in withdrawal or pain. The pain is localized so I'm pretty sure it's actual pain vs. withdrawal. Especially because my UA came up negative for opioids. I do have a residual cold now though because of the exhaustion and lowered immune system from the withdrawal but that's not a biggie. What's going to be trick is finding something that works for the pain that isn't opiate based. I think right now it's all about keeping clear and developing better coping mechanisms for my situation. I'm not sure what that looks like right now but at least I'm taking steps towards it.",1529109093.0

I'm curious whether it would be possible for someone who was on 'done 
- and decided they want to stop using it for whatever reason - to stay well with dope after cessation of the juice. I know that methadone is strong so I imagine if it's feasible, it would only be for those whose dose of the methadone was in the lower range (say 30-80 mg per day).

I'm not currently enrolled in MMT and this is more of a hypothetical and not self referential question. Any experiences or thoughts would be appreciated.",1529108088.0

We are all volunteering for a cause that I care a lot about, and will be on the phone talking to folks the entire time so I need to be on my game/feeling comfortable. 

If I fix a shot and bring it with me, is there anything that I should be aware of? I know that dope in water begins to change molecularly into morphine so I realize it will be weaker. I just don‚Äôt want to get into the bathroom and the dope have turned into a solution that is too thick or weird to use. I don‚Äôt feel comfortable fixing a shot there due to time/all the different accessories that I would need. 

I am using tar, and it does occasionally take some work to get a large shot into the rig, so I‚Äôm thinking that I should make a few shots with more water than I normally use to be safe and not have it become too thick to shoot.

I am on suboxone maintenance but I have been clean from heroin a year on May 22nd. 

I would be proud of myself except when it came out that I was a heroin addict to my family, it motivated my cousin to go to our family and admit that she was struggling with her sexuality and with alcoholism too. She said she wouldn't have done it if I wouldn't have gotten help. She went to rehab and had gotten sober from alcohol. She was in the National Guard, had graduated certified in chemical weaponry iirc. I was so proud of her. She had always looked up to me and followed in my foot steps but this past year we had really bonded and looked to each other for support. We would text or snap each other telling each other that we were proud of each other and that we motivated each other. She was a HUGE support to me. Just having her look up to me and having her be motivated by me made me want to keep doing good.

Well, May 2nd of this year was my 29th birthday. My last birthday in my 20's and 20 days shy of one year clean of heroin. It started out as a normal day but ended up the worst day of my life. I'm not sure when it happened, but my cousin had fallen off the wagon at some point and had killed herself on my birthday. This really, really, really, fucked with me. I'm SLOWLY getting better but there was a solid month where I didn't know if I was coming or going. The only reason I didn't relapse was because I knew she would be disappointed in me. I blamed myself. I have a lot of regrets regarding my cousin that I can't get over. I know that I need to go to counseling to really work through this and that is my plan, I just have to get some things out of the way first, one mainly being my dog's surgery. Which I took care of yesterday. My dog is like my kid and I was really worried about her. Now that that is off my plate, I thought I could relax some but my ex seems to have impeccable timing and decided to text me after months of no contact. 

I'm trying to stay healthy, and on the right path. For the last year I've been talking to a guy that I did absolutely fall in love with but he didn't feel the same about me and I could hear it in his voice. I don't want to be with someone who doesn't want to be with me because it just makes me feel bad about myself, so I broke it off. It still fucking hurts really fucking bad, but I can't force him to love me. It's sad though because a lot of our issues are internet related (we were long distance) and i'm sure if we lived near each other those things wouldn't even be an issue.... Anyway, the ex from my heroin days is texting me again. Apparently he is doing good and I'm glad he is doing good but I feel like he is trying to squeeze his way back into my life again and I know for a fact that this cannot happen. We were toxic for each other. I know this. I hate that he is hurting over me, but if we ever ended up together again, which we won't, it would end VERY bad. I told him yesterday that I didn't want him to get any ideas of us getting back together and to start calling me and obsessing over me and he said that he wouldn't, he just needed a friend and I know the most about him (we lived together 10 years). That would be believable if there wasn't 20 texts from him on my phone this morning and for the fact that he has been texting me all fucking day. I am trying to stay on the right path but with everything negative that's happened recently - breaking up with the guy i'm really in love with, my dogs surgery, my cousins death, etc., I hope I'm strong enough to put a stop to this.. I really do. Any suggestions are welcome.. I need the help. ",1529099879.0

Doesn‚Äôt knock me on my ass, and if I‚Äôm out and about doing stuff I‚Äôm not really impaired, just cheery. 

I came across some XR morphine 30. If this sounds familiar I already made a post about this asking questions a week ago but now I have just a slightly different question for anyone who has the time to help a sister out.

Planning on plugging it because of BA. So using the charts on the sticky I see that orally 10mg of morphine is 6.67 mg of oxy, so my 30mg morphine equivalent to roughly 20mg oxycodone. So this is where I want to double check. If the bioavailability for the morphine goes up from 30% orally to 70% rectally, the 30mg morphine should go from being equivalent to 20mg of oxy to more like 45 mg. Does that sound about right? Because if so I‚Äôm looking at a dose that‚Äôs a little higher than what I‚Äôm use to and should maybe start with less than a full pill? 

And does the crushing and plugging bypass the time release? I‚Äôm thinking that would effect the potency one way or the other as well. 

What do you guys think? I used all the sidebars like I‚Äôm suppose to before asking, just want to make sure I‚Äôm getting it right. 

Interested in hearing from people familiar with the dose and roa as well.

I had a few dealers... One main guy, and a few back ups just in case he disappears off the face of the earth. This particular night my main wasn't answering and I was starting to feel like garbage. So I decided on dude #2. There was 2 problems. One. I was short on cash bc it was so slow at work that night . Two. I was spending the night at my normie friends house that has no idea I use. Noone here does. And my family back home thinks I'm 2 years clean. Anyways.... I come up with a plan. Not an amazing one... But a plan. I text him and first ask ""hey can you front me a gram until tomorrow""? He says yes bc we have done this before. So next I tell him my situation and just say... ""Listen do me a favor. Just leave the shit in a cigarette box by the driver side door of my car in the driveway. Ill run out and grab it as soon as you drop it off"". I couldn't have her see I was going to meet some gangster lookin ass dude outside her house at one a.m. to hand him money and come back in. I can't blow my cover here. I try hard not to at least. Anyways. He agrees. So I wait for the text that its there. He messages me ""its there"". I immediately say to her "" hey I forgot my cigarettes in the car ... I'm gonna go grab them"". Walk outside and.... Nothing is there. Mind you we are on a back road. No one is around . I came out 30 seconds after he text me. There is zero possibility someone grabbed it or him leaving it at the wrong address. So I feel my stomach dropping and I frantically make the call to him and ask him where the fuck he left it. He says to me that he left it there.... Which is totally impossible. Not only that but he says now I owe him for that.... And I have to pay for it regardless if I want any more shit off of him. LOL. Needless to say I never hit him up again. He thought he was my only dude and I had no choice but to pay him that money if I ever wanted his shit again. That shit still pisses me off to this day.

I have minor scoliosis and went to 6 different doctors to see if I was able to be prescribed anything besides a weak ass muscle relaxer they were getting me to try (which had no positive effects) and went the easy route buying my own meds black market style. I created this habit starting off on 10mg hydros and 10mg oxycodones. Throughout my years of abusing this medicine I have created a tolerance, obviously, but I never tried to fit the need of getting high enough to try anything hard (dat boy.) The maximum I would take in a day would‚Äôve been around 80-90mg of hydros mainly. Yes I would rail a mblock 30 if it came around at the right price but for the most part of my addiction I stayed with minor opiates knowing the dangers. I always kept up with how much acetaminophen I was consuming so I avoided as much liver damage as possible. 3 days ago was my breaking point after trying to come up on some and finding nothing but fake pressed Watson 853s that broke down like powder in my mouth and made me fatigued enough to lay down at work. I‚Äôm so tired of relying on a dboy everyday to help me feel normal. I came clean with my parents and told them my problem and they supported me. We have decided mutually that I need medical advisory and rehab just to keep me grounded from where I‚Äôve come from. My doctor told me that cold turkey was too dangerous and prescribed me 4 hydro 5mg daily to wing me down. I wanted to get tram but she insisted. I literally begged her not to give them to me. I know this is going to be a life long struggle but the money I make and was forking out is my motivation along with giving my parents there son back and of course being healthy again.  But I know that I can‚Äôt do this alone so any wise words from this forum will help tremendously. This is the end of this road for me truly. I‚Äôm more into putting it into action with little said instead of just saying oh yeah I‚Äôll quit I‚Äôll be ok. Well hell na , that little voice saying ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù will always be here.",1529075809.0

West to east. Well 2.5 years ago i had gotten caught with a bunch of xanax, 492 i believe was the exact number. Anyway, they put out a warrant and i had no idea. Well i also had a dui case from the same week that the xanax situation happened. I missed court and just didnt think about it for about 2.5 years. Anyway, i decided to goto rehab last july and get clean, then moved the family out with me to the east coast. I remembered i had that DUI case to worry about. so i hired a lawyer back in the west coast state to goto court for me. He got me a deal. 8 days in jail, serve 4 with no probation or anything. It was actually for 2 dui's possession of heroin and 2 paraphernalia charges for crack stems, this was all within 10 days. So i go back last feb. to serve my 4 days in jail...upon release they tell me i have an outstanding warrant in another county, which was just the county a few miles away. I post bond on that and get to go back home to state on the east coast. Well, i re-hired the same lawyer for this case...he swears up and down i wont have any jail time for it, since its so old and only a C4 substance and i had already voluntarily went to rehab and gotten clean. I knew this was too good to be true, but couldnt help but be hopeful. Anyway, court for this was on May 9th, which i didnt have to appear at. I called my lawyer the 9th, 10th, 11th, and 14th, 15th. Left messages, never got any calls back. I assumed they had dropped the case like he kept insisting they would.  
Well yesterday, 06/14/2018, over a month after court, i get a letter in the mail saying this is a Time urgent message. It states that the only deal i could get was to serve 4 months but no probation. And if i dont make it back my the end of this month to turn myself in, the deal will no longer be available and the judge that agreed on it is moving up to a new courtroom so will no longer be there. Soooo, if i dont make it back 2,300 miles across country in two weeks i will miss out on that deal and have to see a new judge who probably wont be willing to cut me a deal like this one.  
To top it off, ive been out of work since 02/25/2018 due to major back/spine surgery that i had on 04/06/2018. So ive exhausted all funds available to myself and wife. I picked up another job to bring in some income until i can get back to my normal job.  
I now have to come up the money somehow to get back across country, but i have a wife and son who have to come with me, oh and my dog. Which mean we're driving because its wayyyy cheaper than all those plane tickets. She would stay here but we have no one to watch out son while she works and she wont be able to afford daycare without my income. Back there she has her family who can babysit while she works, while i sit in jail so that when i get out we'll be ready to move back east.  
  
Sorry for ranting, and probably not making much sense, since my mind is all over the place. Im stressed the fuck out, on how we're going to get back, im pissed about having to goto jail...Im **MOST** upset at my lawyer who couldnt even call me to tell me this, and give me time to prepare. Instead i get two weeks notice. I have to inform both jobs of mine, and my wifes job that we're leaving, for 2 months!  
 
Now the shittier part. Im on 75mg/day of methadone. They say theyre going to try and detox me as fast as possible, but i know it isnt possible to come off that quick.  
All i want to do is get high honestly. im dreading going to jail being sick from methadone WD's the whole time.

8rb5ga,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8rb5ga/the_most_frustrating_moments/,2,https://redd.it/8rb5ga,PontiffTheGreat,The most frustrating moments,"are when someone brings up your substance use maliciously in conversation, directly or indirectly, stating or implying, how ""wrong"" or fucked up we are as a result. Even when it originally had nothing to do with the conversation. Irrespective of your current status quo in life and towards substance. And you can't be defensive/argumentative even if what they're spitting is utter bullshit.

Everyone's independent circumstances; both internal and relational, are definitely nuanced. But generally; should we nevertheless just surrender to these moments? Their words may be cloaked in a stigmatised sense of righteousness; but are often so profoundly incorrect and hurtful. Should we accept that having made these mistakes we are forevermore second to and beneath them? That we are shittier human beings?

Hush and deflect the conversation. Or should we stand up for ourselves in these moments?

---

Want to make a separate comment on here about how this affects me, I think it's critical for us pain patients to speak out. I'll try to keep it brief. After being mangled as a pedestrian hit by a car, I will have chronic pain in my leg for the rest of my life. I have massive Hardware in my leg, rod in my femur was multiple screws in my hip and knee. I was study on a low script for 6 years just fine, suddenly lost my script for 10 mg oxy without having done anything wrong, I wasn't abusing it I just could not afford an MRI uninsured that a new guideline required me to have to continue being prescribed it.

Not at all blaming anyone else for my addiction, but I must say that I never once bought a pill on the street during those 6 years. What did happen though, was me going to the streets and mediately after losing that script. When pills got expensive 6 months later I was using heroin. And the two years since I have absolutely destroyed my entire life. I want from someone who was unfortunately hit by a car at 16 and stuck with a lifetime of some pretty rough pain, so now someone who also has that same chronic pain but is additionally ifucking heroin addict on top of it.

What is going on with pain patients and their scripts is complete and utter bullshit.
- People on scripts for years, even older riddled with arthritis and a stack of things wrong causing them pain, are fearing being cut off, likely without even as much of the taper, and they the day is going to happen.
- People are being pushed to Suboxone for pain management, when the reality is that it doesn't help everybody's pain and I do experience a pretty noticeable decrease in pain control by using that for paying since I am in recovery for my addiction now. 
- 7-Day scripts are not going to help anyone, and are truly ridiculous for anybody that's not post-op or a temporary injury that will heal, people that are going to be prescribed long-term should be prescribed on a 30-day basis. Sure, hold people accountable, drug test pill count whatever. But limiting the script so drastically is so detrimental. Going from pill Mills insane High unnecessary oxy scripts to anybody that says their back hurts, to ibuprofen and being told to stretch when you have documented proof of legitimate pain, is not the answer.

Pain patients are becoming criminals, risking felonies to supplement their lost script when they turn to the streets. Pain patients still need to go to work functioning when they are aching and withdrawing following their inevitable off from their medication. Soccer moms are out there buying pills in the hood, people with low tolerance is that are buying illicitly are having to worry dying from a fentanyl or random research chemical press when it would be avoided altogether if they could just get a goddamn script, pain patients that never even abused their scripts are being treated like junkie scum. Chronic pain is debilitating, chronic pain has made me suicidal. People should not be contemplating suicide seriously because they are in such severe untreated paying, I have seen more than one post on here and the chronic pain sell about people wanting to end their life because they hurt so bad.

I can think of a handful of solutions that would solve much of this, but it seems like the ignorant people that are in charge of it I have no idea what they're doing. Hey, maybe a requirement to be in charge of this shit should be having chronic pain. Because clearly everyone's ignorant, lacking compassion, and seems to want people jumping from the doctor's office to shooting dope over untreated pain...

 1. If they are going two limits scripts like this and push pain patients on Suboxone, let people get methadone easier as well. Allow Kratom to be a thing as it keeps a lot of people's pain and check without having to escalate to harder things. You can walk into a Clinic being a heroin addict and get a high dose of methadone that would absolutely kill pain. But yet it's much harder to get it prescribed for pain... Why? As an addict I have full compassion for other items, however it's somehow easier for drug addicts to get help then it is for pain patients to get pain. That is not fair, drug addicts to get help then it is for pain patients to get pain. That is not fair at all.

 2. Cut that 7-Day script bullshit for chronic pain 

3. Let primary care doctors continue treating moderate pain, ultimately though just let doctors be fucking doctors and not refuse to prescribe and fear of their DEA license. 

4. Stop continuously decreasing the amount that doctors can write, and insurance companies need to stop suddenly refusing to cover more than a certain morphine equivalents in a script. Bust the doctors that are actually abusing their power and wrongly over prescribing opiates script, let the others be and treat their damn patience the way that they see fit as... A doctor! 

5. This isn't something that government would do, but still something that would help all this... Pain management clinics need to cut the cash-only bullshit some of them do, and methadone and Suboxone need to be more easily accessible as it would help pain patients and also addicts as well. 

6. People need to drop a goddamn stigma around people taking opiates for pain! It's totally possible to use it as prescribed and not be a junkie, and stop shiting on the people that have fallen into addiction after pain issues. Thing of simultaneous pain patient and raging addict has made me want to kill myself at times because it is such a goddamn miserable existence . Stop telling people with debilitating pain to suck it up, stop being so uncompassionate, trust me if Tylenol worth we would fucking take it. I would love a normal life. 

7. And for those that r a simultaneous addict and being patient like myself, like I stated above, which is a more and more common story these days the current state of this shit... Make methadone the remedy for this if Suboxone doesn't work. People seem to develop the belief that if you form an addiction you don't deserve pain control and should suffer, no... That's bullshit. I'm an addict, and my pain is still real and valid. I deserve treatment, I don't deserve to be shit on for something I didn't ask for. I didn't ask to be injured, I didn't ask to lose a script that I was studying on for 6 God damn years.

That about concludes my rant I guess. This whole thing is fucked. I'm bitter at ruining my life ending up on heroin immediately following losing a script, it's bullshiter it's not fair. I'm better at the what ifs, I'm bitter thinking that this probably wouldn't have been My outcome  otherwise. I'm bitter that I wasn't abusing my script, and lost it without warning. I'm better that I have fucking shot up heroin because of the progression of events. I get to enjoy life of chronic pain and being an addict. It's miserable,  and I'm determined to use every breath I have to use my voice  to speak out on this and to help pain patients, addicts, those are both etcetera.  Too many people are  stigmatizing  these groups. At the end of the day, I'm still just a God damn person beneath my addiction and a person that just doesn't want to hurt anymore. A person that is considered suicide to make it stop, on multiple occasions. 


TL DR, nobody gives a fuck about pain patients when implementing these policies.  Pain patients are turning into criminals. Pain patient  with no record are catching felonies buying their medication on the streets. Pain patients are using heroin. Pain patients are becoming suicidal over such debilitating pain. Pain patients are not always addicts. But if they are addicts, they still deserve relieved! Pain patients should not have to fight for a script for Percocet with extensive documented damage to their body. Pain patients being prescribed opioids are not why there is an epidemic! Pain patients are not responsible for past over prescribing. Pain patients deserve options to feel normal. Pain patients wish that non narcotics and injections would work. Pain patients are tired. Pain patients are being neglected. Pain patients are using fucking heroin and it should not be happening ever due to a lost script by someone not even abusing it!!! I repeat, pain patients are using fucking heroin  to treat their pain. Pain patients are your parents, your grandparents, your peers, or you someday. Pain patients that are young still have pain that is just as valid and should not be dismissed for their age. Pain patients are not often just drug Seekers.. Pain patients don't deserve to be treated like junkie scum for treating their pain with opioids. Pain patients shouldn't be told to suck it up, ever. Pain patients for the most part did not ask for their pain! Pain patients are not the ones crying wolf begging for stronger and stronger meds. Pain patients are overdosing and dying. Pain patients are risking coming into contact with fentanyl. Pain patients just want a normal quality of life, want to be able to work play with their kids enjoy their free time Etc. But instead leave doctor's appointments in tears with their pain untreated, invalidated, and driving them insane. If you have not experienced chronic pain, please have compassion for those who do deal with it. And please do not try do finesse an opiate script when you don't need one, every post on here that's ever been made asking for tips in the ER or the doctor took score a script takes away from people who really need it and it's bullshit. I truly want to punch every motherfuker in the face that fake pain to any extent trying to score opioids, it's an insult two people that never asked for pain and never asked you truly need these drugs. Thanks to anyone that's listen, and to those that are hurting along with me I hope you have a day of minimal pain and please feel free to message me anytime to connect to someone else who gets it.",1529064763.0

](https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8q6byk/im_checking_into_the_hospital_tonight/)

I went to one hospital which referred me to another. I was completely suicidal and verbalized this to both hospitals. The first one gave me a package of resources to call for the withdrawal/suicidality, and the second one told me they thought  I was lying about suicide and since I had, had an evaluation 10 days before (where they really should've hospitalized me) that I wasn't eligible for a new psych evaluation.

I was beyond devastated and nearly got hit by a car over it because I flung myself into traffic hoping to get hit. The police were called and they tried to reason with the ER but again all the ER did was print out paperwork for me to call myself and wouldn't call psych. Even with police involvement. I kept saying I just need help and they kept saying that I didn't meet the criteria for suicide and that they would not give me opiates. I repeated that I just wanted to withdraw safely with my suicidality and chronic illness it wasn't safe to do it outpatient. 

Some 25-year-old doctor whose ego was way bigger than his reasoning skills just said no and referred me to another ER.

I got home slept 4hours and then decided to go see a doctor I trust - my hematologist - he helped me with IV meds for that day and right after my appointment with him went to the 3rd hospital. The ER there was great. They helped the withdrawal immensely with clonidine, 1mg Ativan 50mg Benadryl 4mg Zofran, 30mg Toradol, and so forth that I slept like a baby for a little bit.

They decided to hospitalize me on the psych unit there 72-hour hold. They didn't allow IVs on this unit and I might as well have been going cold turkey because I kept vomiting up the oral medication they gave me. I got very little out of that hospitalization. about 60 hours in they broke the hold early & I revisited their ER just to stabilize my situation.

Now here I am 

4days and 5 hours since I last used. I'm out of the woods withdrawal wise, but now everyone wants me to go to a 30day rehab. I'm very much so against that. I'll do an IOP but not inpatient/residential and I think it'll work for me because they'll be able to work around any work schedule I may have. I think it'll work out well. IOPs are typically covered insurance wise whereas 30-day stays are not and half the reason I want to so many ER places is that we were trying to do it covered by my insurance all the detox places would've cost us $2,000 and up.

Anyway, I'm off the drugs again (YAY!) but I'm in incredible amounts of pain. I'm hoping that subsides soon.

**Edit: I realize running into traffic was a bad idea. I really could have endangered someone else and i own it that that was wrong. If i could apologize to those drivers I would.  I was in a very fucked up state of mind. Anyway I'm currently checking into an outpatient treatment center.  They do not feel inpatient is right for me especially since I'm already detoxed. Right now I'm just going to put the pieces back together, own and accept my mistakes and move forward.**",1529057107.0

My method, in hindsight and through testing, doesn't work and it involved mixing the ""powder"" (read:beads) with baking soda and melting it together in a toaster oven on something metal and then throwing it in the freezer to stop the heating . Then I would scrape it up and snort it.

Well firstly, baking soda burns like the devils taint up your nose. Secondly, it still takes a good while for it to work.

The new method I just discovered involves using alcohol as a solvent and sugar as a medium for solidification of sorts. I made a small pile out of a 36mg Xtampza capsule on an aluminum plate (the side of a vaping mod). I added drop after drop of tequila until the whole pile was thoroughly wetted and was starting to run. Using a small coffee straw I mixed the booze and the XT together until it seemed to be dissolved. Then I added a pinch of white sugar to it to collect it all and stop it from running all over the place. Then I heated it in the toaster oven until it swelled up and bubbled slightly.

Immediately I put it in the freezer to stop the heating process and to solidify the goop. This method didn't give me a pile of material that I could snort unfortunately so I scraped it all up and ate and chased it down with some soda.

The alcohol/heating definitely broke it down as it wasn't granular hardly at all AND it tasted pretty f-ing good. More importantly, within 25 mins I was fucking high as if I ate 40mgs of oxy IR. Normally with Xtampza you have to wait at least and hour to feel it fully.

\*\* TL;DR: Mix Xtamza powder and alcohol until dissolved, add sugar and heat in oven until bubbly, freeze for 10 seconds, remove and eat. \*\*

Fucked up in T+25mins.

Hope it works for you all. Im sure there's a better medium than sugar that might result in a crushable/snortable final product. I just don't know what that might be.....corn starch?",1529053543.0

8r8a7d,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8r8a7d/i_had_a_pleasant_er_experience/,12,https://redd.it/8r8a7d,thumpasauruspeeps,I had a pleasant ER experience,"Well, except for why I was there which was the excruciating pain in my back wrapping around my abdomen. I was sweating, shaking, pacing the rooms of my home looking for some sort of relief. This was a pain that struck a familiar nerve and I remembered experiencinging it a decade ago. Mother fucking kidney stone pain and it seemed way more intense than last time.

Yet I was very reluctant to stroll to my local emergency department. See the first time I had stones many years ago I was into drugs, but hadn't yet scared my arms with thousands of needle stabs. When I went to the ER that time it was Dilaudid buffet, with the nurse proclaiming during my discharge, ""Oh, you've still got another shot (my 3rd) on your precription, want it for the road?"" Fuck yeah I said, and by the time I got home 5 minutes down the road I projectile vomited everywhere. I was having a blast.

In between then and the present I had totally fucked my life by jumping on dope and banging, leaving obvious marks in the crooks of my arm. It has been a few years since I got clean and got my life on track but the marks are obvious and the health care junkie radar has been hyped to NORAD proportions. I was not hopeful my ER visit would result in easing my pain.

However, something had to be done, and even if they would not afford me pain medication I at least needed to get this checked out. You don't want to fuck up your kidneys. I stumbled in and was taken to triage. They took one look at me and it was clear I was not having a good time. Vitals checked, now it's timed to get blood drawn. The first barrier. They draw from my left, by far the worst of the two. They tell me to go to another area, but as I get up a nurse says, ""Sit down, I'm gonna give you something for the pain."" Thank Christ.

I got a IM injection of Toradol which I had never heard of (worrying) and which I now know is a NSAID. This shit actually brought my pain down to not great, but fairly managebale pain. I had to wait until a room was ready for me. I was pretty impressed this weak ass drug actually did something and they get me a room and get a CT going. 

In the meantime they don't give me any narcotics but ask how comfortable I am. Im honest and say for now I'm ok but the pain is coming in waves. I'm not really trying to score opiates. I honestly should stay away if possible. An hour later though and I'm back to writhing and call the nurse. The doc who breifly saw me earlier before being pulled away said give him some morphine. The nurse starts prepping an IV line.

She looks at my arm, sees the scaring, and says she's gonna go above it to avoid it. The cat is definitely out the bag now, but I don't care since I'm still getting the morphine. And I was thankful because it nearly instaneously brought me to normalcy. Cool, but I figure the mercy is up since it obvious to the staff now that I had drug addiction issues.

Nope, the doctor comes in and says they saw a stone, I'm getting a script until I see a urologist, and she even gave me a Norco to take there before I left. I was pretty amazed that I got narcotics after it was clear I had an IV drug abuse history. Especially in the current climate around pain meds today. It probably helped that I obviously was in pain and clearly did have stones, but I've heard some horror stories.

A sad and surreal aspect of the trip was a girl in the room next me was there on an OD. She'd been narcan'd and was alert, then she tried to just dip out the side. The nurses were arguing with her, saying she can get discharged but can't just dip. Then she did just dip after agreeing to stay. Then her boyfriend was calling threatening the nurses. They were all talking about security and what an asshole this guy is. Next there is someone on the phone talking about social workers on their way and the children of the girl. I was being wheeled out for my CT and could hear the staff saying something like, ""The younger daughter is happy, playful, and social, but the older daughter is showing signs....."" and then I was around the corner.",1529037518.0

I've been wanting to do this for a long, long time.  I have become acquainted with some of you throughout the years-some of which have been good experiences, some of which have been awful.  


I guess this is what we call a shitpost.  I really wish I had something meaningful to say.  I have been doing heroin for about four years now.  Its an on-again-off-again kind of thing, as I have never let my habit grow too large.  That being said I do go through stints of daily use.  These runs consist of somewhere between 1-3 bags of ECP daily, used in small quantities throughout the day.  Heroin gives me the motivation to accomplish tasks and be social, but it robs me of the human elements of life.  I may get more things done, but I am less thoughtful, and overall less creative.  I have been maintaining using Kratom recently which is a godsend, however I think it only works because my habit isn't too large.  I am working on quitting again, as I am sick the cycle that we all know too well.  I make good money, but I'm always running short by the end of the month.  I want to be a more balanced individual.  That being said the ups and downs of addiction hold their own attractions in a fucked up, twisted kind of way.  


I have tried going to meetings and therapy in order to stop using drugs.  I've been to hundreds of NA meetings but I'm just not sure that its for me.  Therapy was moderately helpful, but I found myself lying to my therapist so I concluded it was a waste of time.  Like I said earlier, Kratom has really been the most helpful thing for me.  After finding Kratom, I have become a huge advocate for maintenance therapy.  Every opiate addict deserves to have a maintenance option, and in my ideal world, this would come at no cost to them.  Maintenance is truly lifesaving, and from a societal and financial point of view is 100&#37; justifiable.  


Lastly I just want to say that I am very self conscious that most of my sentences start with ""I"".  It makes me feel very self-centered and selfish.  Shoutouts to all the contributors to this subreddit and the internet at large, as it is actually pretty difficult to write a post.  There is a lot of uncertainty about what to say and the format is so free-form!  You really have to think about what you want to say.  Anyways hope everyone has a good night, good day, good life!

I think in intense, long-habit acute WD it'd probably be very very tough to sit still in a tank for 90 minutes. but for anyone in PAWS looking to break up the monotony of not using and feeling dull, or for anyone in MILD wd... give it a shot (although its not the cheapest ""cure"" out there)

TLDR; if you began withdrawing the syringe from the vien, while still releasing small volumes of liquid-- leading sayyyy 0.05ml of fluid to accumulate between the skin and vien (during its exit). am i in any sort of danger? everything was sterile to OCD or medical standards




I wont upload pics cos im too paranoid for that.

however-- being right handed, i tried to inject into the crook of my left forearm; but got scared and pulled it out (no blood entered the syringe like i thought was supposed to happen, however after removing it-- it was obviously a vein bleeding). turns out the 30g syringes i have are quite hard to draw on with one finger...

so i retried on the other arm, with my less synchronized left-hand... I think as i began pulling out the shot my thumb was still on the plunger and so a small amount of liquid continued to be released as the needle was being withdrawn.

it was initially a bit red, but thats subsided a fair bit-- what is petrifying me is this very small lump above the vein. less raised than most pimples, and skin coloured.

it is very small-- but could this be an abcess???? please tell me im over reacting. I believe a very small amount of fluid was left between the skin and the vein. the small lump has a yellowish tinge to it (not unlike the liquid in the syringe), and the surrounding area just seems mildly blotchy

So I'm just curious, when and how did you get addicted to opiates (if you are) and when was the first time you used? I wonder how many of the stories are similar and how you feel about it now.

I just want to hear your story.

Edit: One reason I refuse opiates is I get addicted to the smaller things, I couldn't imagine the difficulty with drugs.",1528997818.0

I have been an in and off Opiate user for several years and my parents drug test me semi regularly. I usually just use a bag of warm water and drop a tea bag in there for just a second to give it some urine color. This has always worked like a charm... until recently when they started using a new kind of home test. This new test has been flagging my ‚Äúurine‚Äù as positive for opiates, but nothing else (it also tests for cocaine, speed, and THC). How is that happening? It‚Äôs not giving an invalid result or testing positive for any of the other substances - just opiates. It‚Äôs literally just water with the faintest hint if earl grey tea.

Total setback?","Alright basically, I shoot dope on/off but went for about a week and a half straight so got hit with light withdrawal. I typically use for 2 days straight, twice a month. Supplements chronic pain meds that are in short supply. The withdrawal doesn't much bother me *except* for the insomnia. I'm already an insomniac and any withdrawal makes sleep impossible for me. Haven't slept for 3 days and can't currently get any benzo's or into a doctor. I'm completely exhausted and going nuts here. Will 1 shot to sleep for a night set me back completely? Yes it's a slippery slope and all that for most people, but it *will* be one shot, no more. 

Seems to me like it would likely set me back, but it also seems sort of like a long taper. I realize it may extend withdrawal a little, but at this point 1 night of sleep may be worth it if it doesn't start me over completely. If I don't, I'll probably go until day 6 or 7 without sleeping.

I've decided i'm going to quit again (and I always do, the problem is for how long...)

Anyways, to end this binge i've got 15 sealed sterile needles (30g, 1/2 inch needle length) which I plan to use over 5 days at 3 doses a day. I only bought 5 sterile mixing cups (the metal ones you get from needle exchanges instead of spoons)

So for question number 1; Would it be bad IV practice to use the same mixing cup/'spoon' everyday while changing filter and syringe for every dose? (I.e cooking aparatus replaced once daily, rigs and filters replaced after every use-- 3x daily)

they said the sterile spoons were for one time use-- but i suspect they say this to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS, I use alone so this is a non-issue. I don't see how reminants of water, heroin and vitamin-c will lead to a blood borne infection, at least not over the period of a single day

My second question is-- I am obviously going to start **low**, If say-- my first dose was *too* low, could I retry again with that same needle? assuming of course i hit the vien on the first try every time (i *was* a bodybuilder, but remain very lean and vascular-- my arms are naturally tourniqued so i cant imagine missing one of my fat viens). I know syringes blunt with every time they penetrate the skin-- but surely it is not necessary to throw it away after a single insertion? we are talking a 2nd attempt MAX here, so that i dont risk an OD (and once i know my dose, this wont be necessary). I do not wish to experience any scarring whatsoever, ive got alchohol swabs and the lot and am being very medicinal/OCD about this. Would a 2nd attempt leave a scar?

Any advice would be much appreciated",1528990312.0

So, I'll do my best not to rant too long here, but brevity and I rarely see eye-to-eye, so let me go ahead and apologize for the length.  First ever post on reddit.  I've lurked this forum for roughly a year now, and I feel like I know a number of you, though I obviously don't.  I didn't even make this account until a few months back, thinking I would post then, but you know, fear and anxiety, so it goes.

I've used for roughly 17 years now.  Cut my teeth on the old school 80s, things went from there as they tend to do.  I've had fairly sizable daily habits in the past, but I don't get to indulge too much these days.  The old back and forth of a handful of days sober, only to end up caving in and doing more.  Which of course wouldn't make sense to a lot of folks, but I know I don't have to explain that around here.  But yeah, my tolerance is pretty low these days, which is good, but I never seem to stay clean long enough to feel much stronger, mentally or physically.

Anyway, much love to all of you folks.  Seriously, I know you get a decent amount of posts like this, because I've read quite a few myself.  I keep wanting to try to put myself out there in some way, and well, I know I'm never going to do it if I don't just fucking do it.

I used to love to write, though it doesn't happen as much these days.  More inane ranting than anything.  I've lost a lot of things I've written over the years, whether it be poems/songs/stories/etc.  I always preferred the pen and pad, but after a certain point, I started typing things more often.  This was the main reason I would inevitably lose things, via hard drive crashes and the like.

I had a bit of a story written at one point, one that I really liked where it was going, even though I wasn't quite sure where I was taking it.  I ended up losing it, but tried to recreate it years later.  Naturally, we're always our own worst critics, but I don't think what I have now is as good as what I once had.  Then again, that's how life goes, eh?  Nostalgia is arguably the most intriguing emotion of all.  And, in the words of Oscar Martinez, time is a son of a bitch...

To try to begin to wrap this up, after finding a few things that I had written or rewritten over the past few years, I wanted to share something here.  Something heartfelt, though possibly trite.  I could go further into the origin of the story, but it's probably much less interesting that letting you interpret it as you will.  I didn't expect this part of the post to go on for so long, but I am mildly buzzing right now, and extremely bored, so there's that.  Regardless, if you're still reading at this point, all the love in the world to you.  And even if you aren't still reading, hey, that's understandable.  I genuinely hope you're all doing as well as you can be, whether stone sober or nodding like a motherfucker.) <3

It was a dark and rainy night.  Water cascading off of the windshield, reflecting light in the loveliest of colors.  Your eyes glowing as they met mine, assuring me I was fine.  You had me convinced we were looking through the same set of eyes, though you always seemed to wear your emotions as a disguise, I wasn't privy to this information at the time.

It's hard to blame you, though you clearly had plenty of faults, it's not as though we both didn't.  We had wonderful conversations that night.  Of blue flowers and wooden coffins, of how things could only improve from here.

It felt like you believed in me.  Fuck, you made me believe in myself, a more difficult task than I wish it were.  Bombarded by waves of various emotions, we smiled seas and cried oceans.  You touched my face as we kissed, you held me as I stroked your auburn hair.  We shared bowls and smokes, all while watching as the moonlight cheered us on from afar. 

I thought we would take on the world, you and I.  But it really didn't matter, you were becoming my world.  Obsession can be deadly, yet also weirdly necessary.  I felt at peace for the first time in my life.  It was a dark, rainy, beautiful night...",1528955302.0

My question is for those who can successfully chip. How often do you use and how often do you take breaks?

Love you all first of all, this is just a quick post I had to make or well, I feel I had to make.

So, in withdrawal as I have been plenty of times before over the past 4-5 years of my addiction (on and off, 2 rehabs you get the jist) I currently am on day 2, and I sit here with massive amounts of goosebumps while I sweat the goosebumps keep on happening over and over. Of course, cold sweat. Not fun.

I sat there and realized I am just sitting here watching TV as If I normally would be doing, if I was high; but alas I am not high I ran out 2 days ago. Fire heroin, DNMs, expensive shit. Well, as I sit here with goosebumps I realize my emotions are all here, right now. My senses are back, its hard to explain but ya'll know what I mean it's like you walk outside and everything is heightened sounds smells etc (esp. b/c I sniff, probably) the smells are insane its weird pizza even smelt overwhelming earlier as you guys know this is what withdrawal is like; and it feels shitty for the most part of course.

But, why not just enjoy this time that I have right now while I have my emotions? It's an awesome thing, even though I feel like shit. Music sounds amazing, it's like I realize what the fuck I had not been enjoying music the past 6 months or so I have been using for fucks sake its orgasmic. 

I know when I got clean the last time, it was like that too for me. But any of my fellow opiate lovers do this? Like, shit the emotions are here right now, enjoy it before you pick up again. 

I am probably going to have dope tomorrow, so why not enjoy the moments I have with my emotions back for now since I know I'm just gonna use again as I am not in the mindset to stop right now. 

Weird thought I guess, because feeling like shit may overpower the willpower to even try to feel ""good"". We all sit and loathe during withdrawal I feel like- or at least I just was until I realized fuck I am wasting precious energy as my soul is here right now whereas when I am high it's kind of like I am a ghost in a shell. 

I also notice I laugh my fuckin ass off at random shit as if I am manic, due to the heightened emotions and senses. And it does feel good.. so try and laugh if you're on day 2 like me.. <3

Since then I‚Äôve had my fair share of experiences with DMT LSD NO2 Weed etc. but I still crave that sweet sweet euphoric bliss that is the nod. I‚Äôm young so it feels to me that being high is all I‚Äôve ever known. I‚Äôm about 30 days sober off of all substances now and none of their absences really bother me that much except for the opiates.

I keep myself very occupied but slipping into a strong nod is all I can really hope.
Is it possible I‚Äôm just not ready to quit? I‚Äôve maintained a lot of sober time willingly it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm out on the street looking for it and I‚Äôve made a lot of progress on myself as a person but I just want some opiates for fucks sake.

The first time I tried meth, I smoked it and went on a 3 day bender that included no sleep or food. It was great, and I totally saw the appeal. But I didn't really fall in love until my first time IVing it. 

It was a Saturday night, my ex and I were at Walmart. I wanted to steal another TV to trade to our dealer for some dope. We'd already traded the 43"" smart TV I boosted. My ex (let's just call him T for story's sake) was ready to go home but my degenerate junkie ass was not having it! Let's just try one more store, I got this! Sure, OK. So we are standing outside the store before going in so T could smoke a cig. He's chatting with some employee that's outside on a smoke break. Out comes your stereotypical homeless junkie lookin' dude. Within a minute he mentions beans. Beans?! T and I lock eyes with that devious grin. *beans are capsules of heroin in the Midwest, just to clarify*. So T is the smooth talker out of us both and when it comes to manipulating in the drug game, he takes the cake. Within minutes the three of us are in our truck, giving this random dude, Juice, a ride home in exchange for a bean each. 

Except we never actually take him home. Once we realize he has slew of drugs on him, we push things a bit like the junkies we are. T and Juice bullshit back and forth for a bit, I add in my charm wherever needed. T butters him up some and it wasn't long before Juice pulls out like two grams of shard and lets us try some. We ended up spending the next twelve hours with this random dude, and going through the entire bag of meth. But that first shot is what really stands out in my memory. I'd considered snorting it, but we had rigs on us and I was feeling impulsive and had never banged it before. 

I disregard T telling me not to go too hard and prep up a fat shot, shaking in excitement at getting to try IVing it. I hand T my loaded rig, as I didn't know how to hit myself yet. I wrap the phone charger cord around my arm to tie off, and hold my arm out across the front seat. I look away, still squeamish about needles and blood (when in just a few weeks I'd be relentlessly poking myself with hooked needles and bleeding everywhere). Despite being in a dark car, T hits me on the first try - as always, he was a pro at hitting himself and others. Immediately I'm hit with a rush I'll never forget. I wanted to puke. I wanted to talk a million words per minute. I wanted to move. I wanted to do everything. I wanted to feel like this forever.

I'm over a month clean from heroin, almost never crave it, but god damn do I want some meth. ",1528935719.0

We are opening our first detox facility, and seeing that California just legalized medical marijuana, we want to be one of the first facilities to offer CBD Oil as a service to help with the detox process because of its awesome effects in helping the body through various symptoms. We know a lot of users are tired of the conventional treatments for substance abuse detox, and we truly believe CBD oil will be a safer, healthier alternative!

How likely would you be to admit yourself to a detox facility if it offered CBD oil/edibles/water/aromatherapy as one of it's services to aid the detoxification process? Is this a particular aspect that would interest you? Or maybe, would it discourage you from admitting yourself? Do you think your significant other/family member would admit you if they saw CBD oil was an option at our facility?

For the last year or so he's been snorting about 90mg Oxycodone approximately 3\-8 times a month, with the last three weeks being more like 2\-3 times a week.

I injected it in my forearm near the elbow. Soon after, the bottom of my arm and my hand went numb. Then my hand curled into a hook kinda, and i couldnt move it at all. Naturally I freaked out. I was in my college dorm with my roommate who didnt use drugs or know that I did. (Well he knew i smoked weed). I told him i slept on it wrong.

I called the campus health center, and they made me come in. And me, being completely unable to admit the truth (my parents didnt know I used), told them that I slept on it wrong. This was one of the most selfish things i have ever done. This lead to my very worried parents taking me to see a bunch of specialists like neurologists to see what could be the problem. I didnt tell them what happened until way later when i came clean to my parents about my addiction and went to treatment the first time. 

Apparently i hit a cluster of nerves including the ulner nerve. Long story short, I had to drop out that semester and take all my exams the next semester. It took 3 months before I could write again, and another 2 before i had regained all feeling and control of my hand. It was my right hand, so i was incredibly scared and thought i might have paralyzed my hand for good. I am so greatful that it went back to normal eventally.",1528921173.0

Today, even though I smoked some weed and managed get some food in, my stomach is in extreme pain. This isn't the same pain as last few days because that was from hunger. This pain actually hurts right in the pit of my stomach.

Although I've been strong thus far, I'm seriously considering taking 10-20mg of Hydrocodone Bitartrate. I have 150ml of 1mg/1ml liquid solution and don't ever want to get back on opiates because of how bad the withdrawals are every time. How far will this set me back provided I only take this one dose just to get the pain to go away? I'm pretty desperate right now. Or does anyone have any suggestions on how i can relieve this pain? It feels kind of like cramps but right in the centre there is a heavy and somewhat sharp pain.

I relapsed on a 4 month dope binge, about a half gram a day. My savings were running out, knew I wouldn't be able to pay rent if I kept it up, so I had to kick. AFAIK, nobody outside of my connects and one AA friend knows.

So I bought 6, 8/2 suboxone strips. It's hard to recall exactly how I tapered.

Day 1: 8mg

Day 2-4: 4mg

Day 4-5 (maybe 6): 2mg

Day 6-9: 1mg

Day 10-12: .5mg

Then slivers (.1-3mg) every 2-3 days when unbearable (still had to show up to work/life.)

I have a lot of sub left if needed but I want to get it out of my system. I have been exercising a fuck ton and getting sun to stay sane. My big problems are sleep (sweating as fucking / insomnia) and anxiety (I got a panic attack at work the other day and cried).

Tools left:

Xanax (taken about .75mg at most, 6mg total in detox, usually for sleep)

Gabapentin (I try to take 600mg but doesn't seem to do much, have a fuck ton left from last rehab)

Ambien (haven't used)

Clonidine (haven't used, when do I use this?)

Caffeine (energy drinks to wake up for work, 80-160mg caffeine)

Thc

CBD (seperate from THC): I use sometimes but idk if it does much

Melatonin (used once)

I wish I had trazodone, valium or phenobarbital, and flexeril/soma... I could look on craigslist for kpins or valium, doubt I'd find the others.

Weed is really hard for me to stop and provokes anxiety so I want to stay away but I have used some.

Today I woke up and had chills / diarrhea but could be from a good sleep (xanax/gabapentin) after lots of days at work and insomnia.

Hoping chills/diarrhea could mean i'm in the next phase of wd / my body has almost purged all the opiates out.

TLDR; kicking dope w/ subs/xans, need advice. Worst parts are sweating, anxiety, insomnia (xanax helps all but don't want to trade one addiction for another.

Can we compile a helpful document to help with home withdrawal? Hear me out.,"Most people who develop an addiction/dependence on opiates have gone through withdrawal at least once, and for most us us (myself included), have gone through it many times when we either run out of our shit or want to get clean. With that said, I come to this community to seek help in composing a withdrawal cheat sheet or FAQ sheet. This will not be your ordinary cheat sheet that contains tips on how it will help the user get through it; we have those on here and other parts of the internet. What I am looking to help create is a sheet that is for your friends, family, significant others, etc. (read: people who have never been through it), to use and help understand what exactly is going on during WDs. It can be something as basic as a do & do not list of things that they (non-users) can refer to in order to help out the person who is sick. 

It does not need to be a peer-reviewed medical journal, and I think it would be best to keep it short and concise. Maybe it can cover:

What is going on physically

What is going on mentally

A basic timeline explaining how long it would take each set of symptoms to subside

What to do to help

What NOT to do to help

When to seek real professional help (I'm thinking call 911 type of help, not treatment)

This thought just crossed my mind because I am about to do a home detox and want to make it as easy as possible for all parties involved. I have been through it enough to know what to expect and all that shit, but this list is for people who do not have a ton, or any, WD experience. Feel free to add or remove items from my list, or downvote this to hell because it is stupid. I don't care. This is a throwaway anyway.
Stay safe out there.

I don't think this version has been posted, so enjoy. I'll post some stories about before I turned to IVing soon.)**

---

I was the prototypical junky. Long semi-oily hair, skinny as a rail and unreliable as fuck. I woke up in the morning to sweat-soaked shits and kicking legs, and immediately checked my phone. Did I already have a message? Yeah, probably. Dan: ‚Äúhey get ur ass up‚Äù. I was the money man. I was the middle class kid who always figured out a scheme or a scam to get the hundreds of dollars a day we needed. They were simply the middlemen. I take a bite of my strawberry cereal bar, the whole 100 calories it was in its entirety. I gag at the taste, even though I used to eat these like candy. I‚Äôm already sick as fuck but also constipated at the same time. Don‚Äôt ask, I never got the shits until around day 3 of withdrawal‚Ä¶ If I'm lucky I'm alone and can walk out of my house unbothered. Otherwise, my parents were standing right there, like the army lieutenant from Full Metal Jacket (or that‚Äôs is how I saw them for the past few months). ‚Äúoh hey mom‚Ä¶ I'm going out for a bike ride.‚Äù She shakes her head. There towards the end she didn‚Äôt even have the words to say to me anymore. My heart broke more and more each day. 

I rolled on out the blacktop driveway as I made a stop in the bushes right across from our old wooden fence dividing the property line. I quickly but calmly grab my rig (short tip, long tip or any size. Hell, even bent. My longest running was nicknamed ‚ÄúCoffin Nail‚Äù) from a random spot in the bushes I had thrown it the previous night. Could NOT be bringing that onto my property with the way my parents are. I continue walking out this little country backroad as I‚Äôm staring at my phone waiting for the call from Dan or Dillon that they are pulling onto my street. I listen to Burrough‚Äôs Junky on audiotape from youtube (and about how his maid said opium brought sweet dreams. That sounds better than the oxymorphone nightmares), and suddenly the phone rings. it is them. ‚ÄúHey man get to the graveyard to meet us quick, Dillon has a credit card we can use to turn into cash. You can figure out how, right?‚Äù. Oh fuck.. How am I gonna do this? Of course I would figure it out but OF COURSE I can‚Äôt rightly say how either. Nonetheless, one could likely wonder how I ended up in this position, so let‚Äôs get back to that for a second.


[drug den 2.0, 8PM june or april(?)]

It was a calm day in April as I stood within a small 5x10 laundry room with bleach, appliances and every single thing you would need to shoot up some little rubber pills. I wondered to myself‚Ä¶ ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no way you can IV these things. I‚Äôve seen the threads on bluelight. This will fucking kill you‚Äù. I kept thinking and realized I ultimately didn‚Äôt care. It was just once, right? I wanted to feel that rush, damnit! I was just a young drug aficionado who wanted to push that limit time after time. Dillon has this stupid fucking smirk painted upon his face and nothing could change it. He was filled with glee regarding the damage I was about to instill upon myself. It was actually quite morbid now that I think about it. Dan on the other hand had the blankest expression I have ever seen. If I were not a man of logic and reason I would tell you that his eyes were pitch black that day. That is how they looked anyhow.

He reached for the fresh pack of insulin syringes in the cupboard above and tells Dillon to fetch some warm water from the kitchen. ‚ÄúMake sure it‚Äôs fucking warm this time!‚Äù, Dan insists. I watch him carefully dip the pill, wipe the coating on his worn, old red long sleeves and stick a quarter of a yellow E series opana 40mg onto an aluminum foil tray he made. He turns on a nearby toaster (the fuck is that doing here?) and begins to let it warm up. ‚ÄúOh.. you have to cook these by the way‚Äù, he just now tells me. I knew it would be a rough process but not this rough. Okay, I‚Äôll survive. They have so far, right?

Before I know it, the pill is mixed atop a coca cola can (bottom side up) into the gross, black and brown amalgamation which was thicker than the sweetest honey this side of the Blue Ridge Mountains. I see Dan bite off the end of a cig filter (sweet, more lack of sterility for me to cringe at. Ahh.. how things would soon change) and throw it into the mix. He begins to draw up this honey into the orange tipped insulin syringe. ‚ÄúHold out your arm‚Äù, he says. I hold up my arm, shaking all over from nerves. How would it feel, I wonder. He says I will feel a poke just as the doctors say. I feel it, but it isn‚Äôt bad. I kinda liked it already. I now actually turn my head towards him to watch how he does it. I‚Äôm not squeamish anymore. I noticed the little tiny sea of red blood rush into the brown moat of oxymorphone solution. Uh oh‚Ä¶ this is it. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in..‚Äù, says Dan. I watch as he slowly but steadily pushes down the plunger, and I‚Äôm already feeling it‚Ä¶

It begins in my forehead, like an exotic kiss from the ghost of all my past loves combined. It was so warm and inviting, so quick and powerful. So natural, so real and delightful. It felt like meshing souls with the gods (or demons). I felt my body go completely numb with euphoria and I was sitting on flowers. I was wrapped so tightly in the opiate blanket I couldn't move much at all. I was back in the womb again, but it looks like the forest from alice in wonderland. Everything has a feint glow to it. Colors are much more vibrant. Everything is now soft to the touch, no pain or discomfort could see its way through this chemical Wall of China. I remained blissfully trapped in this little wooden kitchen chair, in the back of some old ladies home, a legit drug den. All my anxieties and all my fears, all my hesitation about the thoughts of my peers and family,  were all gone now. I look up with glossy eyes and a similar shit-eating smirk as Dillon had earlier. ‚ÄúHow is it‚Äù, they both say in unison. I muttered out, ‚Äúpretty fucking amazing. Everything I thought it would be and more...‚Äù This is it, I knew already in the back of mind. This is how I want to feel forever. 

I didn‚Äôt hang around long. Even while high as a fucking kite, I knew I had to get out of this bed bug infested home. My mom and I would both freak if we got them. I gave my appreciation as everyone‚Äôs mouth dropped that I was capable of getting up at all, let alone ride my bike home. This became a common theme with myself and my drug addict friends. They were always amazed at my natural inclination to ‚Äúhandle my shit‚Äù. Maybe it was simply a natural tolerance. I‚Äôm not quite sure still but it applied to all types of drugs. I floated down the brick steps under the glass sliding door connect this den to the outside world. We would usually sneak in this way as to not bother the actual tenant of the home. She was chill with all us junkies hanging around apparently. She just knew we would be dead or in jail otherwise I guess. I hop on my 250$ mountain bike that is supposed to be shared with my mom. She never uses it though. It has become my daily driver for my drug missions. It really sucks in a town with not enough sidewalks, and drunk/high rednecks swerving all over the pothole infested and cracked road. 

I did not even care tonight. I couldn‚Äôt see well, but my instinct was guiding me home. Home was my happy place, and on my peaceful bed I would always meditate. (Ever gone into a meditative state while high on IV opiates? It is bliss and even better than just the typical nod. I told myself I was repairing all the damage I had done to my brain. Ha, yeah‚Ä¶)

I glide down the sidewalk beside the bank at warp speed but to me it feels like slow motion. My pupils were pinned and my eyelids were so heavy I can barely keep them open long enough to see I‚Äôm on the pavement. I continue downhill past the funeral homes, dollar stores, prostitutes and pharmacies which now dominate this small town. I pass the government living buildings in downtown, which I normally don‚Äôt like biking past due to sketchiness of the road AND the people. However, on this night, bring it on. I was one of them now. They all loved me. Just show them your fresh track marks! Shit is like a badge now. I was feeling all chill about it on the ride home, and for the rest of the night as I crawled up in bed after meditation and threw on some adventure time. 

I remember shutting off all my lights and barely cracking my door, implying I‚Äôm asleep. No way I wanted to deal with my parents now. I doze in and out for a few hours in a blissful haze similar to the time I sniffed some heroin but a lot stronger. There was literally no way for me to stay awake long like this. The pull of my bed‚Äôs comfort was in its prime state. A state only achieved with chemical influence. I go to bed for a presumably dreamless night, but if I did dream it was probably already about shooting up. 

In the morning I awoke, and everything was normal for a brief moment. I look around and stretch, when I see it. A big nasty bruise and red puffy lump on the crook of my left arm from the needle‚Äôs bite. I feel an extremely intense feeling of disgust wash over me like all the litter in the ocean just came and I bathed in it. 

I felt like scum, and I was never gonna do that again‚Ä¶

Found a plug that let me get 100 mg tram  2/1$ and got myself hooked in college. The plug and I disagreed on something and we broke ties. I found a new plug to get me oxy at .50-1$/mg. This was great because I had enough money to buy about 60-90 pills (10mg and 15mg) a week and was functioning perfectly.

Eventually that plug claimed to sell me some pink 10s (never played me before) and I had a bad feeling about it. Anyway she hands me some pinks and I drive off. The letters appear to be scratched off but I didn‚Äôt think TOO much about that bc the bitch was a junkie herself and she‚Äôs never played me before.

I'm a doctoral student in sociology at NYU, where I research missing persons.

As part of my research, I‚Äôm trying to learn more about how and why people end up listed as missing, which isn't very well understood by either academics or law enforcement. To that end, I'm currently interviewing people who have formerly been classified as missing, either formally or informally, for a peer\-reviewed academic paper.

I‚Äôm posting here because, anecdotally, I‚Äôm finding out that a significant number of people who end up missing are dealing with opiate addiction. This keeps coming up in interviews with families of the missing, as well as in social media posts about missing persons cases. I'd really like to learn more about this, as there‚Äôs virtually no research on this topic.

If you were ever a missing person, even for a short time, I'd love to hear more about your experience. If you're interested in participating, please fill out the form below. All interviews are confidential. And, if you have any questions, I can be reached by DM.

I live with my parents house because it was the last place I could go, and if I get thrown out of here, I will literally have nowhere to go (not an exaggeration). My plan is to claim that I got addicted to pain pills that were prescribed by my former doctor (he abruptly closed his practice last week). So, my question to you guys is what would be the best pain pill to say I was prescribed and now no longer have access to, that resembles dope the most? What I mean by that is which type of pills have the same length and type of WD that dope has. I haven't done painkillers since the days when you could get IR OC 80s very easily, so I am a bit dated. This is my last ditch effort to save whatever relationship I have left with my parents, and in their mind, getting addicted to a pill from a doctor is a lot different than getting addicted to ECP.

So hey everyone I'm  on methadone now but when I was a user I used both bth and ecp a lot. Bth was always cheaper and felt more of tucked up high where eco felt more clear headed, but both could make you nod.  I also preferred tar because less likely to be cut with fent and I loved the taste when smoked. Tasted like bbq. A huge benefit bth has over ecp is if you're caught by someone besides police you can play it off as hash. 

ECP was stronger most of the the time. The strongest  bth I ever did was not as strong as the best ecp I ever did.  I felt tar had more legs too, but also a worse withdrawal.  

Also to anyone who has had #3 as well as bth and ecp could you compare.

Like I said I know it's been asked before but just wanted a new discussion.
Thanks everyone and have a great day.",1528903513.0

I was prescribed it for the off label use of anxiety/depression after a year of trying 7 different meds, therapy and TMS. I pulled my back and was prescribed a narcotic and was told by the urgent care doc to stop taking it as there may be some negative interaction. I then proceeded to have some of the best sleep I‚Äôve had in a while for two days, but then shit got real. 

I starting taking Gabapentin around November and loved it. I just as quickly started developing sleep issues but didn‚Äôt make the connection. The medication was taken consistently with 2/3 days of misuse just to see what it did (damn you Google) but for the most part taken as directed, 3x100 mg daily. Around Jan I started taking 300 mg all at one time, I don‚Äôt remember why. Beginning of Feb I started taking it sporadically as I started to feel the best I had felt in over a year, me thinking it was because of a much needed career change and TMS therapy.  I was on the road to mental health recovery and didn‚Äôt want to be on meds anymore. But around mid Feb I started developing body tremors and sleeplessness. Staying up late because I couldn‚Äôt fall asleep but then sleeping 7/8 hours, no big deal, as I was not working and could sleep in if I needed to. But then I would fall asleep then wake up about wouldn‚Äôt be able to go back to sleep for hours. Plus I started having stomach issues and gained 10lbs in about 5 weeks. I got checked for thyroid issues and leaky gut, both negative. I also went and had blood work done and checked for vitamin deficiencies, still waiting to hear on those. But I finally made the connection that it was because of the Gabapentin. 

Some other notes. My symptoms: bloating, stomach pain/organ swelling, insomnia, mild anxiety, internal body tremors/heart palpations, throat fluttering, occasional headache, weight gain. I have tried everything for relief over the last few months. Valerian root, CBD oil, pancreatin, turmeric w/black pepper, gaba supplement, thyroid therapy (hypo), thyroid calming (hyper), otc sleep aids, trazadone, magnesium citrate, and now magnesium orotate, lemon balm, lemon grass, B12 and biotin vitamins. They all (except hypo thyroid supplement) knock me out the 1st day and then palpations come back with a vengeance the next day and then bye bye blessed sleep. 

I‚Äôm on day 12 of the withdrawal and it does get better daily, but that first week is a bitch. The exhaustion and not knowing what‚Äôs wrong with you is overwhelming and I could barely function and was incredibly irritable. Thankfully not too much anxiety. Now knowing what the problem is and lessening of symptoms makes this bearable but it still sux.  My stomach pains, and bloating went away, I did adapt a healthier vegetable, fruit, low carb diet, and added probiotics tabs, komucha, and yogurt cut out fatty fried foods and junk, etc. I‚Äôve lost 2 lbs, since my back prompted this so that‚Äôs awesome. Now I‚Äôm just trying to figure out the sleep as I‚Äôm getting 1\-3 hrs, sometimes at one, or spread out throughout the night.

I‚Äôm going to do a celery juice cleanse for 3 or 4 days maybe longer to detox my liver, as the palpations may be caused by a fatty liver. I also had a colonic on day 8 and plan to have 2 more to detox me. I‚Äôve also reduced my alcohol intake and plan to start working out as I was already 170lb at 5‚Äô4‚Äù.

I remember coming off of Effexor and thinking that that was horrible. That was a cake walk comparatively, the brain zaps lasted for about a month after the last dose.  I didn‚Äôt have to take anything more than a multivitamin and magnesium and I could sleep. Right now I‚Äôm just taking the gaba, b12, biotin, magnesium orotate and turmeric. Hopefully I‚Äôll be able to sleep soon.",1528893776.0

I woke up at 11am to walk down to the hood as my dealer wakes up around 11:30 every day. As I walked up to the gas station I saw him turning in before I even called him, so I took out my $20 to cop my 5/10 gunpowder. (FML... it's been so underwhelming lately, but where else am I gonna go with a $20 bill) I'm thinking my luck is gonna be good.... grab the cap, and head to McDonalds.

Go into the stall. Now, my fucking rig is stuck. It sucks being in Florida as it is SO difficult to get a rig I end up using the same one over and over again and trashing my veins. So I start trying to lube up the plunger and finally succeed. Get some water into my hand and draw it up.... *fuck. My cap was in that hand.*

So now I have this squishy fucking cap and I cant open it so I just put the entire cap into the spoon with water and start trying to dissolve it. I'm starting to really sweat now and I'm sick out of my mind so I all I can think of is getting this shot together. I can't find my filter for like 2 minutes. Finally, I draw up the dark liquid up from this MESS in the spoon. Sit down on the toilet. Can't find a fucking vein.

Well, I'm digging around, digging around.... when I MUST HAVE NOT LOCKED THE DOOR RIGHT, BECAUSE AN OLDER GUY WALKS RIGHT INTO THE FUCKING STALL WITH ME. He stares DIRECTLY at my heroin syringe in my arm and goes ""Jesus fucking Christ!"" and FAINTS right there. Like are you fucking kidding me? What the FUCK am I gonna do now? And on top of that, I can't just put my spoon away, because it has a mess of cap and dope on it.... maybe like 30&#37; of the cap that I couldn't draw up.

In comes another guy. He sees the guy passed out on the floor, I'm struggling to put all my shit away but my spoon is still on the baby changing table and this guy is passed out preventing me from closing the stall door. This guy manages to get the old guy up, who proceeds to yell ""He's shooting heroin in there!"" To everyone in the store. Some innocent bystander is like ""I have narcan in my car!"" Amidst images of a mob of customers holding me down and forcibly narcanning me, I start running.

So I snap a pic and put it for sale for $9.99+$4 and it says Im the lowest seller, Nice!  

I buy 2 packs while Im there because who doesn't need tooth brushes. I said on amazon that I had 5 packs available (I lied). 

I go home and go to sleep. Wake up in the morning with 5 toothbrush orders!! My net is $11.59 per deal so $4.50 a pack so I just made $22ish bucks. Fuckin A! Doing nothing. I added 10 more to my Amazon listing and run off to the store. By the time I got to the store I had 3 more orders. They had about 30 packs left. I bought 20 and went home.

Past few months I have pretty curious as to trying opiates. I know it's not the best thing to be curious about, but the past year I have really been experimenting with new substances. Tried my first psychedelic, smoked weed for the first time, and even tried cocaine just a few weeks ago.

Just some background as to who I am as a person. (Not sure if this will help to what I am getting at, but possibly someone can relate or understand?) I'm 19, college student, and pretty depressed. I am actually writing this post as I am doing my calculus homework for a summer course that I am taking. Past years have been pretty brutal mentally. I think this is a big reason as to why I started dabbling into drugs; just to maybe give me some type of happiness. From a past post about heroin, one part that stuck out to me was how content the person was. I can't recall the last time I have been content and overall satisfied with anything. Here are my two questions:

What made you start using opiates?
Do you regret using them?

I appreciate any comments and would love to hear some advice from any users here. I briefly read all the rules, however if this going against in any reason, I apologize. Thanks!

I believe she has been clean, for the most part, for almost two years and has gotten it together with a new career that has lead to her being stable once again. 
She came to visit me for a couple of days and I couldn't help but notice that she could not keep her hands off her face. She had complained to me about her face breaking out and how she wanted to pop a pimple and I told her not to as it would make it worse. Well, she touched it the whole time she was here. She also kept doing the index finger sniffle motion repeatedly, kept touching her chin, finger in the ear and the list goes on. This made me uncomfortable but I did not want to confront her as I do not know much about drug use signs and symptoms.

Don‚Äôt write it off just because of a few horror stories. 


I was an heavy opiate user for about 4 years or so. It started like many other people‚Äôs stories with prescription opiates, namely norcos, morphine pills and Roxies, but quickly turned to BTH when my pill habit got too crazy. After a couple run ins with the law, constantly disappointing my family and a terrible car accident that happened under the influence (luckily I only injured myself and no one else by my stupid actions) I finally decided to get clean. I went to an outpatient suboxone treatment program and therapy to help get my head on straight and try to live a normal life. I‚Äôm currently in my 10th month of sobriety using suboxone. I have a great full time job, the trust of my family, no more debt and a much better outlook on life. And I have all of this because of the great outpatient program I‚Äôm in and suboxone. 

The reason I‚Äôm making this post is because I know that some people in recovery look at suboxone as either the devil or not being truly clean. And yes, while I am still taking an opiate drug, it is nothing like taking a drug to get high. I literally don‚Äôt feel anything from my suboxone, it simply keeps me from going through withdrawals and from constantly craving opiates. It allows me to wake up and live a normal life while thinking clearly as opposed to the mental fog induced by drug use. Suboxone really is a wonder drug for opiate addicts and I think the stigma around it should be seriously scrutinized due to the fact that suboxone has worked for so many people. The only caveat to this is you need to find a suboxone treatment program that does it right. Some programs definitely prey on vulnerable people and simply try to get them to switch to suboxone and stay on it forever for monetary gain. They don‚Äôt offer things like therapy or counseling to help a person understand why they started using to begin with and then giving them the tools to deal with these things in a health way. They don‚Äôt offer any help other than a prescription. However, there are many more programs that do offer these things and I believe that, in conjunction with suboxone, therapy and counseling can help a person truly overcome addiction. I guess what I‚Äôm really trying to say is, don‚Äôt think that all suboxone programs are there to scam you. Some definitely are, but if you find the right one it can be life changing. If you‚Äôre looking to get sober, try to find a program that offers suboxone treatment and mental health counseling among other tools to help you stay sober. Another thing, try and find a program that has a taper schedule planned out from the beginning. My program is 2 years long, however it can be shortened if the patient shows significant improvement throughout the first year. I plan on starting my taper within the next 3 months and I don‚Äôt even have the slightest urge to use again. Idk, I just feel like this needed to be said. Suboxone really is a great tool for recovery and if you want to get sober, it is one of the best options us opiate addicts have. 

That‚Äôs all I really had to say. Don‚Äôt right off suboxone completely because of some of the horror stories you here. If you find the right program, it can be a god send. If anyone has any questions about anything I said or the program I‚Äôm in, just lmk. ",1528844879.0

I guess they‚Äôre kind of quick stories with questions attached. Thanks in advance for any helpful responses!

1) I brought my homie back from an OD over Memorial Day with mouth to mouth resuscitation. EMT‚Äôs got there right as he woke up and gave him 2mg to be safe but I brought him back with only a few breaths. He fell out pretty hard though, completely stopped breathing, etc. None of that is very surprising or unusual, but the one weird thing was his jaw was clamped shut super hard. I have a dent in my thumbnail from trying to pry his teeth apart. Managed to somehow still get some air in him but I‚Äôve never really seen/heard of that before. I clench my teeth pretty often from anxiety/etc but I‚Äôve never been told that I did it during an overdose (I‚Äôve had a few too many).

Is that a common thing? If not, anyone else here seen/experienced that? Or know why it happens? Btw this happened immediately, it wasn‚Äôt like I found him that way, it all happened in front of me.

2) I‚Äôve been on subutex for 6 months, started with 8mg which got me feeling 100% better after going through pretty much full WD for about 5 days beforehand (from a .2-.5/day BTH habit). I‚Äôve been on and off the sub all year, usually 2-4mg/day or less, and never off sub/shooting dope for longer than maybe a week. 

I just got off about a two week run shooting dope the other day (think I dosed sub one day in the middle of it) and I started getting pretty sick about maybe 18 hrs after my last shot. I‚Äôve never put myself into PWD from sub but I‚Äôm not trying to risk it either, so I started with just a little bit of an 8mg tab. 

Didn‚Äôt get any sicker but didn‚Äôt feel any better either so I kept taking 1-2mg at a time until I‚Äôd taken 8mg without much relief to speak of. Only brought one with me bc I didn‚Äôt even think I‚Äôd need the whole thing, but I ended up having to bail on my friends and take the bus 2 hours to get home. 

When I got home I kept taking more sub and I still felt like shit. Finally got myself stabilized (mostly) after 24mg. I‚Äôve never had to take that much before! I was only shooting maybe .1-.2/day before that too. Next day I think I took a full 8, then maybe 4 yesterday. Didn‚Äôt feel like I needed any today, I‚Äôm sure I would‚Äôve taken probably 2mg and felt fine but I had a shot of dope (actually felt a .1 shot with that much sub in me but only for a minute, you know how it goes). 

So the question I guess is, anyone else have to take an insane amount of sub like that to get well after using such small amounts? I could see 16mg maybe but I was still totally sick until I got up to 24. Got right back down to my usual 2-4mg in a couple days afterward but that first sick day it took soo much to get well.

It cost him 20.00 USD for 2 grams so I posted at his place while we chased dragons all night.

Anyways, both of us only smoke we don't snort or inject anything, even #4 EC powder. I never noticed this until now, but I usually will run the resin drop along the foil by tilting it down a bit so it rolls and I move the flame to stay under the drop. I always did it this way and never thought otherwise. I just like the look of it, and the ritual of ""chasing the dragon"". My friend, however, creates a little crater toward the edge of the foil and drops his dose into it like a bucket on the end of a little stick. he lights it underneath it's location on the foil, per usual. 

My question: Is there any advantage to smoking dope off foil using one method over the other? 

I tried both and maybe I am oblivious because I don't know what I am looking for, but I didn't notice a difference. You could save a lot more tin foil if you didn't roll it across the entire foil like a roadway though...",1528833305.0

I'm in my new house. moved out of my mom's and I'm in my own. today I am enjoying a cigarette on my own porch after cleaning my house up and I'm enjoying music and the breeze today. life moves fast. trying to numb yourself from change inhibits growth. thank you all so much for the love, support and brutal honesty. today is the first time I've been able to smile without drugs or company :) have a good day all, and to my non sober bropiates, happy nods. 

So I know opiates are a slippery slope I found myself in a bit of a shitty family situation...

my brother is doing 1-2 eightballs of coke a day and is lashing out at everyone, his boyfriend is cheating on him and when I tried to tell him this he kicked me out, which isn't bad but I am living with my ex girlfriend and best friend and now we are both displaced

My mom is in an open relationship with the ass hole I've seen her with for years, I've seen him hit her and attack her car with a crowbar and now she's okay with him fucking some other bitch. she just has to know everything that is going on. (A lot to digest)

My grandpa is bipolar and has a reputation of abandoning my grandmother who is a cancer survivor and a diabetic... the tension in my family has cause them to isolate themselves from everyone to the point where my grandpa has to throw temper tantrums on the phone screaming at people only to have him being very friendly upon walking through the door to greet him. my grandmother, has taken to drinking every night... to the point where she is passed out at the table, slurring her words as I say goodbye to walk home.

My father has been absent since he came out as gay when I was 11 and since then he has tried to live his own life and pretty much abandoned me and my brother to chase dick... now that I am in college for computer science (which I am paying for myself, which sucks because I cannot afford this next semester) thinks he can step in as the father figure after he lived off of my grandparents  (mom's parents) for the past 7 years rent free and now that he 's on his own he feels all  high and mighty and is trying to be my father. 

My ex girlfriend is a wonderful soul and I am so attached to her I don't want to even think about anyone else with her but I don't know if her and I want the same thing anymore.

My boss has heard how everything is going and is offering me a house that I can rent from him, because he sees a lot of himself in me and when I confronted my mom about it she says she doesn't want me to leave.

I've been dealing with substance abuse (benzos and opiates since I was a freshman) I've never been physically addicted before this long as bender... I can't remember if it was weeks or months since I went more than a few days without doing a line or popping a perc... 

This past week I realized when I wasn't using my 30's or sniffing cheese I was anxious as fucking and could not sleep and had bad RLS....

Opiates are the only thing that make me feel like I'm actually normal... I enjoy not having anxiety, or having ibs issues, not sweating, not second guessing everything I say, being confident, nor feeling like I'm freezing to death... but I'm at my 4th day clean. I'm over the worse part I think as I can get out of bed. thank god for clonidine and Robinul. I am scared I have ruined my ability to enjoy my DOC ever again. at such a young age. it's all my fault. I am beyond depressed and feel like I  let everyone down. my ex is horrified for me because I am in so much pain and lethargic and she is too naive to identify WD symptopms. 

how long will it he before I can use again without resetting this hell? I'm going to be clean for at least a month and working on my self control as well as coping mechanisms. when there is just so much going on it is just bliss to be able to sniff a 30 and be able to just focus on my job or class... any input is appreciated. thank you guys and gals so much...

I just wondered if anybody has any thoughts about [the story in the UK from yeaterday.](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/11/epileptic-boys-mother-barred-from-bringing-cannabis-oil-into-uk)


A mother was prescribed cannabis oil for her critically sick child with epilepsy. The seizures WILL kill him. But this oil made from the plant has altogether stopped the seizures and kept him well. Doctor in the UK prescribed it.. Doctor in Canada sold it because it is medicinal and legal. It was confiscated at the UK border because it contains a small amount of THC which is illegal. (It's mostly CBD if I remember rightly - the other chemical in weed that is not psychoactive, it won't get you high, but it helps with anxiety and other conditions - like epilepsy, obviously).

-

This has made me so angry. The war on drugs is fucking pathetic, outdated, unwinnable and has wasted lives, money, time and the progress against serious medical issues like depression, epilepsy, PTSD, addiction.. - All these things are strongly anecdotally aided by various illegal drugs (ketamine for depression, ibogaine/LSD for addiction, MDMA for PTSD, mushrooms for migraine and serious depression etc etc the list goes on and on) Yet science hasn't moved forward in more than 50 years because it's illegal to look at these substances, even in a controlled setting. The pharma industry could have developed non psychoactive versions of any of these drugs by now or worked out their method of action within the brain. Instead, we're decades behind because we've prohibited everything about them - which hasn't stopped a single person that ever wanted to do drugs, from ever doing them!

Drug dealers are like the Hydra. You cut one off, you get two spring up.
I've been sitting waiting for my dealer while reading the local paper about how 5 dealers were caught and sentenced in my city. One of them WAS my dealer. He said he was going to co to use making money until he goes to prison for under a year probably, but sell his phone with all the customers to so.eo e to take over. Not a single break in the chain.

-

Anyway. As we are discovering, one of these illegal drugs is also one of the most medicinal plants ever. (The hippies were right, who knew!).

From epilepsy to cancer. Change the balance of THC to CBD and you get great appetite enhancer for people struggling to eat after chemo.  Or anti anxiety.. Weed genuinely seems to be pretty miraculous for a number of serious conditions.

It's pretty much a certainty at this point. So,while we wait for the law to catch up. This mother may have to watch her son for because the law says this plant has incorrectly been deemed illegal and there is no talk of changing the law, despite the benefits. This story will hopefully bring more attention to the subject. But I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for the government to make a positive change. They're scared shirtless to change drug policy and it's the most cowardly thing any of those politician fucks can do. **Science says 100% to do this... They won't because they're too scared of how they'll look in the eyes of their right wing supporters.  Meanwhile, BILLIONS in untaxed illegal drug currency flows out the country, people die due to science being unable to pursue any psychoactive a (See: 2016 COMPLETE BAN ON ALL PSYCHOACTIVE DRUGS, INCLYDING ONES THAR HAVENT BEEN INVENTED YET!

FYI, this idiotic law saw a 600% increase in hospital admissions because research chemicals were suddenly illegal, people had to turn to the street where they didn't know what they were getting or the dose. Jumping on a gap in the market, dealers started selling Spice - which then TOOK OVER the homeless community (endless news stories about it) with people dying, seizures and getting addicted to it with many addicts saying it is even harder to come off than crack and heroin)

It's been nearly a month now and I feel amazing, I'm still taking the methadone but I actually have energy to do things now and already losing weight not much but its a start for sure.  The one issue I have is I'm getting erections like I'm a fucking teenager again...wake up its there to say hello, gust of wind pops right up and these are only an issue because I'm single but it is nice to know I didn't break things down there.

Besides the thanks and the updates I was looking for a bit more advice I was wondering if any of you know if I have to keep taking the shots (Jesus Christ these needles are huge) for as long as I'm on the methadone or will my testosterone get back to normal and my body will keep it going?  I figure ill have to stay on the shots but I dunno I can hope?    Again I am really glad I found these sub you guys are amazingly nice and helpful...honestly was a little freaked out to post here because of the subject matter (I got no fucking help at all from pain mangement) sub but now I lurk on it a bunch to read your amazing stories.",1528792574.0

(Hijack their connect),"So I just got back into the game after a good 6-8 month break but since I've been on break my dealer went into treatment. Well I've been trying to find a connect for a while and it didn't go very well in the beginning. First off, I was able to find a dude who was willing to help me out finding some good ECP (in my area it's actually hard to come by and more expensive). The only problem was he was charging me $20 extra which made half G's cost $90 bucks!! Wayyy to expensive but it was all I had access to and since my tolerance is so low, it lasted long enough where the $90 wasn't that big of a deal breaker.

 Well, of fucking course the jackass ends up robbing me (I gave him the cash and after 20 min of waiting he said he got pulled over and blah, blah, blah. I knew he was lying instantly because if you get caught with dope or rigs, since he was a shooter, you're going to jail and not for just one night because he hit me up the next day saying he'd ""get me back for the $90 eventually but if I wanted to grab again he could help me out""). So there goes that connection, luckily for the 2/3 weeks he helped me grab I was able to get 2 numbers from him. One was his ECP connect (got the number because one night he was sick and needed a point and I told him I'd only help if I could get the connect). Well he must have known his connect was changing numbers or something because that connect changed numbers like 4/5 days after I got the number (I was able to call the dude 2 days in a row but he just kept saying he didn't have any and he'd let me know when he did... after he asked 20 questions about how I got his number).

On to the main reason of this post... Well the other number I got was some chick who could help me find tar, but she wasn't a dealer, just a middle. I picked up with her a few times but she was the greediest middle ever. First time I grabbed they picked up the dope and shaved off 2 points of my half gram (I said **I** could break off at most a point for her but off course she  broke it off). Well, I decided to buy grams after that so I didn't have to break off as much for them (her and her bf) but of fucking course she wanted 2 points if I bought grams.

I argued with her about it but I couldn't do anything about it because I didn't have any connects yet so I had to deal with getting basically ripped off (especially considering I had to drive 40 min to her place, only to drive her and her bf 20 min back towards my crib where her connect was to pick up).

After 2 weeks of this shit.... constantly trying to get the connect from her, telling her I'd pay for it, etc .... I decide I need to get the connects number. The chick who was helping me would always have her bf come with us to grab and they would always keep telling me that ""you're not breaking off enough"" and would sit there until I gave them what **they** considered to be 2 points off my gram. Well, one day it was just me and the girl and we went to pick up at some restaurant.

This was my chance. I wrote my number on a note and slipped it into the cash... after I counted it out for her. The note read ""Yo, I've been going through Jane Doe for a month now but she's ripping me off. Here's my number, hit me up so I can buy straight from you"".

I didn't expect to hear back but literally 2 min later the chick got a text from her dude. I'm thinking ""oh fuck, I'm screwed"" but he just asked her if I was sketchy, if I'm cool, etc... She was sketched out wondering why he was asking questions and I just said it's probably because he saw me looking at him when you grabbed. Well, 2 min later I get a text from the dude saying I can buy straight from him now!! Later that day he asked if I broke her off some and I told him I always did (and not just a point, but upwards of 2 points).  I told him not to tell her I got his number a few times, and he said he wouldn't......lol

Well, later during the day my phone started getting blown up by the chick. Apparently she was trying to get the dude to give her a few points because she told him I didn't give her anything (which was BS because I gave her easily 2 points this last time because I got the dudes number and was like ""fuck it, here is the last dope you'll get from me"" lol). The connect messaged me and apologized because he told her that he knows I gave her a few points off that gram. So I have to go into damage control mode (just in case I need to grab from her again since she had a few connects)..... I told the chick I never talked to the dude and kinda convinced her that he was lying because ""how could I get his number?"" and ""he's probably just saying that so he doesn't have to break you off any"". Luckily, I also told her I was taking a break for a few weeks after I picked up (this is after I got the connects number, so I was essentially breaking it off with her) so hopefully she stops messaging me (she constantly hits me up asking if I want to pick up again.. Like less than 24 hours after getting a gram). 

FUCK yeah, I was so tired of all the BS I had to put up with going through  that chick and her bf. They were heavy users and that's one reason they were constantly asking me to break off more... to the point where a few times I honestly told them that I'm not giving them any more. As a bonus, I was able to haggle my prices down to $120 a gram (the chick was getting charged $140 because she would never ask for lower prices, and she would get points from her dude for bringing him business so she didn't give a fuck what someone like me paid).

Another bonus... This connect is only 20 min away and is legit. We talked a bit when I first grabbed from him and he hates the girl who was helping me out because she's such a fiend. She constantly tries to score points for bringing him $20 sales and his rule is 1 point for 1 gram sales.

TL;Dr
Chick who was middling for me was a fiend, asking for 1/5 of the dope i purchased. After putting up with her shit for a month I snuck my number and a note in the cash to her connect asking for him to hit me up. And it worked. Also, now I pay $20 less and don't have to drive extra to pick up.

Moral of the story: don't be a greedy middle because people will find a way around you (a point off a gram would have been cool with me and I would have continued to grab through her for a while, but asking for 1/5 of my bag is just greedy).",1528771917.0

8qejsl,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8qejsl/is_there_a_better_more_silent_less_messy_way_to/,21,https://redd.it/8qejsl,rotarimonolog,"is there a 'better' (more silent, less messy) way to vape H rather than foil?","Hi! Been chasing the dragon for a few years, am now a certified professional with virtually no wastage, can even do it all with one hand if given a lighter that has a lock mode. 

Problem: let's face it, it's not ideal. Amongst many drawbacks, i can think of the following:

a) it involves foil. Stories claim that it might be dangerous, other that it's an urban legend. Truth is, if you ever vaped meth from foil then from glass (oil pipe), you know it tastes 100&#37; better in the pipe. So why take the risk?

b) foil is noisy. Trying to unwrap your crumped up foil in the toilet, desperately insuring its fairly smooth while getting paranoid about smoke detectors is sub\-optimal to say the least.

c) it's not convenient. Spending time\-pre\-cutting sheets and stashing them in a book for easy access, carrying foil on you which makes 0 sense and might raise attention, having to buy 'just foil and a coke please at the supermarket' \- well you get my drift.

d) it's dirty. Oh yes, we've all been there, one false move and you touched the underside where the lighter was, voila, black fingers. Now you're trying to wash your hands, but just leaving the foil on top of the table made the table dirty... its' endless.

So... surely there's a better way. I know evidently i could just buy H4 but in the UK where i'm from, H4 is essentially 99&#37; of the time a fent analogue, and i love my life. Mainlining is not a step i wish to take at the moment, and i don't think needles are particularly much more convenient either.

I'm been thinking of carrying a glass surface and chase on that, leveraging a stronger heat source (torch lighter). The problem is that normal glass shatters easily, and the pyrex stuff doesn't come in thin enough, or flat enough containers to be convenient carried.

I've tried oil pipes (meth pipes), no dice, that's essentially either: a) wasting product as the heat is applied evenly to the whole of the product, wasting much of it by heating parts of it way too much, and other not enough, or b) essentially 'boiling it' over , creating a nasty, hyper heated fume that's as impossible as it is  dangerous to breath.

One thing i thought might have some legs is a metal cylinder, roughly 1cm wide, meaning wide enough to sprinkle h within, but also not wide enough to prevent using as an 'all in one device'. Sadly, i had little luck with this, as when i tried the H, if not evenly distributed, would evidently 'roll' and 'aggregate' within the pipe, and eventually either drop down on the floor, or ... dangerously make its way down towards my mouth.. no thanks. The idea came from how you can easily re\-heat any tooter and essentially burn the accumulated resin within it. I guess a mechanism by which little notch prevent the h to roll down when heated or accumulate too much in clumps is imaginable, but it would be rather... specialized hardware. 

I'm out of ideas, so if you have any and had luck with them, let us know! Bonus points if it involves an 'all in one (pipe\-like) device.

Except a few times friends  gave me a pill here and there  (no idea what they were sorry but was told ""they're good"") but taking 1 each time always sucked and just made me a little tired. I was also prescribed tramadol one time and took 3x my dose and it made me feel like one jolly fella! I have bad anxiety and my fav thing about weed is it just makes me forget about the world for a while but I've heard opiates are like that, but 10x better so Idk. I've taken many psychs, molly, and everything else besides opiates, crack, and meth. 

So a few very basic questions (please don't patronize me or make me feel like I'm going to spiral out of control and be a junkie). I plan to take 1 substance 1 time and flush the rest and I won't be able to obtain anymore from my future source to be extra safe. That's even if I have the balls to try it.

I have found a way to get my hands on either H or 30mg oxy (I think they say K 9?) And I want to know:

1. Which is a good starter for 1 time opiate experience? H (not IV) or oxy? 

2. What's a good dose? Not a baby dose, but enough that I can see what opiates are all hyped about and not worry about OD?

3. If I did try H, what is the best route of administration that's NOT IV?

Sorry for the novice post, just trying to be safe and you guys are the experts.

I always forget my login and password so I make new alts all the time. 

I‚Äôve been clean since January 3rd but before this my main doc was opana er 40s.     G74s 

So I still talk to many of my friends/using buddies/whatever the fuck you wanna call em. Well my buddy was looking to buy some opanas of the dark web (which we used to do often for the g74s) and said that the only ones he can find are the stop signs. Which in my head is a red flag because to my knowledge they stopped production of these in 2012 when they switched to the g series. So. 

Q#1- Are stop signs still sold in other countries that the u.s and there is a possibility these are legitimate oxymorphone? 

While researching this I came across this article
https://www.cbsnews.com/news/drug-opana-er-opioid-painkiller-pulled-from-the-market-by-fda/ 
Which is an article stating that in 2017 the fda approached the makers of opana er (I believe this is the g series) and asked them to stop making them and the company followed the fdas ‚Äúrecommendation‚Äù 
So now this leads me to 

Q#2 Are opana g series still even available in the United States to get as a prescription? And if not are they available in other countries?

I know these pills have always been hard to come by without a consistent plug of them, but I know every plug for them I have/had is now gone or doesn‚Äôt sell these and as switched over to selling Roxie‚Äôs or dope. Is this the reasoning? 

TLDR: just read the q1 & 2.

So I waited 24 hours after my last dose and even though I wasn't really that sick I decided to IV about 2 mg of my zubsolv. Instant precipitated withdrawals. Great, I've been through this a couple of times so I immediately recognized it and decided the only way to fix this was by getting some dope and rx opiates in me. Had my plug drop it off between the doors and booted up a .2.. felt much better but not 100% so I convinced my pops to give me 3 opana 20mg ERs (g72s I think).

 Sniffed one, ok feeling better still not 100% so let's try this iso extraction method again. I have the crushed up pill sitting in a hundred mg of ISO and had to take my dogs out so I let it sit for a while by the time I was able to come back to it all of the alcohol had dissolved and I was left with clumps of oxymorphone soaked in iso. added 100mL of iso and used a spare rig/cotton to pull up about 85mL of iso/oxymorphone liquid. Poured into a new cooker and slowly boiled away all of the ISO. Was left with a tiny bit of white residue. Added water and drew up in a new syringe. Booted up and felt nothing again but my receptors were still bound by the bupe.

I think I'm doing everything right and I still think I'd rather have a 40 of dope than 3 opana 40s with their current formulation. I like getting my shit, turning into the nearest lot, and booting up. My wife is sober/never used before so I have to hide everything from her.

i feel i have been living in a fantasy being romantically involved with someone i met in a massive group chat on facebook in august. weve been talking for almost a year. i didnt want a relationship, i didnt want anyone in my bubble, but he came along. hes younger than me, and i remember being his age. hes been using as long as i have, but hes 19 and im almost 24. it makes me feel somehow predatory, though; what if i damage him? i am not good at relationships. i am so insecure that i just destroy them because all i do is cry. i get so overwhelmed by the negativity that i start to feel about being in love - is it like that for everyone? arent you just supposed to be blissful when youre in love? 

he relapsed on tar, and lied to me bout how long he had been using for and how much he had been spending. we had been planning and i have been working around 60 hours a week for a month or so saving and preparing financially for him to come. i told him that all i want is for him to have his drivers license, ~$150-200 for his half of the plane ticket price, and ~$250-300 for entertainment purposes. this is a significantly lesser amount of money than i need to save in order for me to feel comfortable taking this vacation. i just want him to meet me half way and have some spending money. i sugar mama everybody, so i wasnt really trippin, but i noticed that he wouldnt do simple things and always came up with excuses as to why certain steps hadnt been accomplished on his end. all i do is work and i wanted to have a vacation for my birthday. i feel disappointed, but i feel like somehow i dont deserve to be disappointed because ultimately i should have known better. 

he does some things that make me feel like i am being manipulated, but it makes me feel confused because i feel as though i am the one who is supposed to be more responsible for the relationship/his well being because i am older. i guess i feel like this because ive always been the younger one in my relationships. but for instance, i have a bad habit if running away. i have a free spirit and i need to let my nomadic/wanderlust tendencies out. not that im not loyal; i just need my space to be wholly involved in my own self/identity. it took me a long time to rebuild my identity after my ex. i lost myself completely to trying to help him be clean and finally breaking and just using alongside him because i just wanted it to kill me, i felt i couldnt escape. so my identity is important. anyway, i tend to get scared and i want to shut everybody out because im convinced they hate me sometimes - i did a little run away stint and ghosted him at the beginning of our relationship and he made me feel so bad about it that i felt like i couldnt get any space. since becoming more and more involved with him, it feels now like he treats me as though i am clingy, and becomes angry if he thinks im not giving him space. im just lost and confused and i miss myself and i have been feeling like i am living in an extended month long flashback. 

the night he supposedly relapsed (or at least admitted it) i had fallen asleep and my phone was on silent because i hate noisy phones. he called me like 49 times and texted me over 100. the result of this was his relapse. 

i cannot escape how much guilt i feel even though i know i shouldnt. i am terrified. i dont have the strength to fight this battle again. i fought my exs addiction until i died inside and i can feel myself dying again. i never thought id have my fuck it moment again. 

i find it ironic that somehow an oxy was acceptable but the stigma of switching to heroin feels so much more foreboding. 

i think what scares me most of all is looking at the 20s i pick up and thinking it would be so much more worth it if i had a needle to shoot it with.",1528738740.0

I know what I've done to my body. I also know that right now every step is agony and makes it hurt to breathe.

I can't take opiates in moderation. I love the euphoria, but mostly because it was the signal that relief was on its way. 

So I'm on subs and Tylenol and I'm 37 years old. I cannot feel like this for the next 40 years. I feel like my entire body is on fire, and its my legit pain that I was originally scripted for. I can't lift my youngest to change his diaper. I can't even lift him into a grocery cart.

I got to the point where I was shooting my legit dilaudid script and got heroin to help me make it through appointments. Not to be high - but to function as a mother and wife. 

I knew I had to try something different because I was heading downhill, so I'm on the subs. They're great for craving avoidance and making withdrawal bearable, but they don't touch my pain.

I can't live with the opiates.
I can't function without them.

I'm feeling really lost and discouraged. I just cannot imagine feeling like this for the rest of my life. If I have to, it won't be a long one. 

The desire to avoid and fix pain is as old as humanity itself. We're evolved to avoid pain -- pain is our bodies way of telling us something is wrong. But what happens if your brain tells you that something as simple as your kids gentle hug will feel like being beaten with a pillowcase full of bricks instead?

Will my pain ever recede? Is this my body trying to recalibrate what normal pain feels like?

I just know that I refuse to feel like this for the rest of my life. I don't want to be a junkie. I just want to be a mom that can get down on the ground and play barbies without wanting to weep in agony when it's time to get up.

Thanks for reading my whiny-pants post. Any advice is welcome.",1528736028.0

I‚Äôve been using heroin IV for 5 months now, pretty hardcore binge, 3/4 bags per day.

Planning to detox, going for 2 weeks in a place where I have no access to dope.

I have:
‚Ä¢ 4 mg subutex 
‚Ä¢ 20gr kratom 
‚Ä¢ 30 days worth Lyrica 150mg
‚Ä¢ 30 days worth Clonidine 150mg 
‚Ä¢ a few tramadol 100mg
‚Ä¢ a few Ativan 
‚Ä¢ a few Xanax 
‚Ä¢ a few Methocarbamol (muscle relaxant)

I had my last dose this morning (12AM).

When to start my meds and at which pace?

Taking the 4mg Subu is pointless, it means just dragging the wd to the day after (if not more); so I‚Äôm planning to skip it.

I will try to wait until tomorrow morning, once I wake up:

9AM
‚Ä¢ 2 spoons of Kratom + 300mg Lyrica + 150 Clonidine

15PM
‚Ä¢ 1 spoon of Kratom + 300mg Lyrica 

22PM
‚Ä¢ 0.5 xanax + muscle relaxant 

I would keep it like this for 3 days and then start to taper the lyrica and the Xanax; I would use an antihistamine for sleep and avoid benzos.

What do you think about dosage/timings ? Shall I include the subutex ?

My most pronounced problems are:
‚Ä¢ RLS + restlessness in general 
‚Ä¢ lack of motivation / depression 
‚Ä¢ anxiety 
‚Ä¢ sleep 

I usually don‚Äôt have huge problems with stomach and nausea.

Any tip or experience is very much appreciated.

I‚Äôve been taking pills for almost two years. About halfway through that period of time my brother moved in with me (after my ex moved out). He‚Äôs younger, but he has his shit together wayy more so than I do. Anyway, he‚Äôs basically unknowingly supported my habit. Every time I ran out of money he would help. He would encourage me to start budgeting my money better, but he never demanded any more than that. Car got repossessed a couple months ago, he helped me get it back. He‚Äôs been there for me at every turn. 

Over the past couple months I felt his suspicion growing. ‚ÄúWhy is this dude working 80 hours a week at two different jobs but he‚Äôs still always broke..?‚Äù I guess he gave me the benefit of the doubt. He had no idea what a lying scumbag I‚Äôd become. Had no idea I was using his half of the rent to buy pills. I would always intend to replace the money, but with more money came more pills. As they say, the road to hell was paved with good intentions. 

Anyway, a couple days ago he found out we were on the verge of being evicted. I had a payment arrangement worked out with our landlord. No need for my brother to know. But.. people talk. Landlord‚Äôs wife works with my boss‚Äô girlfriend. Small town shit. Loose lips, etc. My brother finds out we‚Äôre behind and demands that I lay my cards on the table and explain myself. I decided it was time. No more lies. No more web weaving. This is it. Now or fucking never. 

I told him *everything*. Thought I‚Äôd have a damn panic attack. But we got through it. He felt so bad for what I‚Äôve been through that he could barely even be mad at me. Now.. he‚Äôs helping me quit. All my money has to be accounted for. I‚Äôm on a taper plan to ween myself off the pills. He has me on a short leash. It may sound crazy, but honestly, I think it‚Äôs the best thing that has happened to me in a long time. 

A couple weeks from now I‚Äôll be done. It‚Äôs gonna be tough. I‚Äôm gonna have to make myself start up better habits, etc. Gonna have to get my mind right. But. I can do it. I have support now. I have this burden off my chest and out in the open. I cannot possibly express how good that feels. To have someone on my team. It‚Äôs not me versus the world anymore. 

Wish me luck. I know I can do this. Prayers, good vibes, whatever you believe in - I would appreciate it. This group has provided a lot of information and knowledge for me over the past couple years. I feel like it‚Äôs helped me to stay safe, and kept me from feeling like I was all alone in the world. For that I‚Äôd like to thank each of you. 

I don‚Äôt judge anyone who still actively uses any substance. Not at all. We all have a path to follow. This happens to be mine. This happens to be the best thing for me, and I‚Äôm excited to see it through. 


TL;DR - My brother / room mate found out about my pill habit. Found out he was basically funding my bs for the past two years. He‚Äôs helping me stay positive while I ween off the pills and get better. Wish me luck. Thanks for being there when I wouldn‚Äôt let anyone else in. Love and blessings to all of you. ",1528714816.0

I‚Äôm gonna try to keep this as short and concise as possible, but I have a tendency to tell stories that are longer than they need to be, so I apologize in advance. So the first time I took this mystery substance, my roxy plug was all out of blues, so I bought ‚Äòpercs‚Äô from him that ended up being fake. They weren‚Äôt pressed though, once I took a closer look it was like someone had scraped off the outer layer of a perc with the markings on it and somehow attached it to this pill, I guess the inner part was pressed I don‚Äôt know. Because when I got it again last night, I was under the impression that I was buying h, so this time it was in rock/powder form. So the rocks and powder were brown with very few white speckles. I‚Äôve actually gotten dope that looked just like it before that was really good. This time, when I crushed the rocks they didn‚Äôt exactly turn into powder, it‚Äôs really hard to explain but the best I can do is to say it was *almost* sticky. Like it turned into a flat piece that I kinda had to break up with my fingers, almost like breaking up weed. I‚Äôve also gotten dope that was like this before, and it was some of the best stuff I‚Äôve ever had, so I was excited. The fake percs were completely white. So the first time I did some this time was last night, but I didn‚Äôt do a whole lot and I noticed I felt kind of anxious and not at all tired, but I still had some left of my last batch, so I figured the new stuff was just not as strong, so I did some of the old stuff and went to sleep. Fast forward to today, I did a pretty decent sized rock when I got to work, and that‚Äôs when I realized I had come across the same stuff as whatever was in those fake percs, which I also had happened to take right before work that time too. So here are the effects. It starts out feeling like I smoked weed. When I say ‚Äòthe percs‚Äô from here on out, I‚Äôm referring to the fake ones of course, and then I‚Äôll probably refer to the stuff I was given last night as ‚Äòthis stuff‚Äô or something along those lines. So the percs first kicked in when I was driving, and I don‚Äôt really smoke weed anymore, but it felt like it used to when I would drive high on weed. And then when it really kicked in full on while I was at work (bartending), I had the anxiety/paranoia and awkwardness/lack of social skills that I experience when I smoke now that I hardly ever do and have lost my tolerance. Luckily, I could do my job in my sleep because I wasn‚Äôt able to think straight, so the things that I do every day that are like muscle memory I was able to do just fine. But I remember from the time with the percs, there was a drink that I‚Äôve made enough times that I should know how to make it but not enough times that it‚Äôs second nature, and I could not for the life of me remember how to make it and as I was figuring it out, I kept doing things in the wrong order and stuff like that. Another major symptom that will hopefully help to identify this is that both times, I kept feeling like there was something under my shirt (the first time) and in my teeth/on my tongue (the second time) that I was trying to grab and pull off but it was never really there. I mean I could absolutely feel it there for sure like almost sharp and poking me but when I would try to grab it there was nothing there. The time with the percs I must have taken a lot more because it was a lot more intense and lasted longer. I was getting very confused about things and having trouble communicating with people and felt like everyone was staring at me and knew that I was on something. That still happened with this stuff but it was a lot less intense. So that along with almost feeling like I was high on weed and feeling things that weren‚Äôt there were the main symptoms. What does this sound like to y‚Äôall? It didn‚Äôt make me tired, but I didn‚Äôt really feel like I had a whole bunch of energy. Also I know in the title I said not a picture, but I do have some left, so if anyone wants to see I can try and figure out how to post a picture, I‚Äôve just never done it before.

I feel that, with the next generation reaching adulthood and the fascist babyboomers dying out, that these next wave of elections are going to bring an end to federal prohibition and a whole new wave of politicians are going to take the front. 

But, the important thing for this to succeed is for all my fellow addicts to *stay alive*. Seriously, the prohibitionists want you all to die so there will be fewer voices against it. Stay alive, stay out of jail, and take care of yourself. If you want to do opiates that's fine but take care of yourself and show your community that you're a good-hearted individual and not a cruel junkie.

For the past year or so, I‚Äôve had a somewhat regular supply of 10mg Percs, which are my faves, and 10mg generic hydrocodone. I also have ‚Äúdiagnosed‚Äù add and have had an Adderall script for almost 8 years. My doctor hasn‚Äôt increased the dosage in like 6 years though, and as we all know, tolerance is a b, so in order for my Adderall to really work for me, I‚Äôm taking approximately 2x the prescribed amount, thus running out early, fml, etc, etc., 
I‚Äôm rambling though so I‚Äôll get to the point regarding the opiates...
Depending upon my ability to obtain them, I may be on them a week or more, then off a week or less with the number of pills capping out (at most) at 7 a day, though on a good day I may only eat 5 or less and it‚Äôs also relative to my Adderall supply. My question is-
is extreme fatigue and lethargy on off days the norm? Reading online it isn‚Äôt really a major withdrawal symptom, so I don‚Äôt know if I cant attribute the tiredness to that, but they give me the most amazing motivation and energy and day one without I‚Äôm seriously zombie mode. 
I don‚Äôt think my usage is to the point to where serious withdrawal symptoms occur, (i have had minor muscle aches and RLS but definitely nothing unbearable) which is why the total lack of energy thing is kind of concerning me, because it‚Äôs my most noticeable symptom yet the one I see listed lease online.

Just wondering if it‚Äôs normal because as of now, the percs are more beneficial to my productivity and motivation than my actual add meds, which just makes me paranoid I have some undiagnosed terminal illness. Or something.

They let me live with them if I stayed clean and they were giving me a home drug test every 2-3 days at different times of the day. I've been staying clean because I knew I'd be caught if I relapsed, and I was trying to save my money to move out first. 

I asked them if they'd take me to a sub doctor because I was struggling and my mom thought that meant I relapsed because her internet research told her subs aren't for people who are clean and her cult AA family support group probably told her the same. My brother was barely a chipper and he quit with no problems. He told my parents months after they found out about me that he used to get high with me too but he's clean. They think because he did it cold turkey without wd or any help that it's easy and I can't do it because I'm not ""taking recovery seriously"". Long story short, my mom was convinced I wasn't clean anymore because I asked to use subs.

This morning I called in sick to work because I haven't been sleeping well and I couldn't think straight. I've been working 60-70 hours a week and I needed a break. I sat on the porch to have my coffee and I fell asleep. My mom woke me up and started yelling at me for nodding out on the porch and for scaring her because she thought I od'ed again. 

I walked to my second job in the evening to get away from the house and when I came home she went through all my things. She found a needle cap in my car and a empty bag in my old jacket that I don't wear anymore. Both of those are from before I got clean and it's reasonable that they got lost and I forgot about them. My dad tried to back me up but he takes my moms side in arguments in the end. They didn't even care if I offered to pass a drug test because of I'm ""cheating them"" somehow yeah? So they kicked me out and stopped talking to me again and I immediately relapsed because fuck it. 

I was planning to get my own place and relapse then when I could enjoy it in my own apartment and feel like I deserved it. Instead I'm staying with a friend and shooting up in a walmart bathroom because he'll kick me out if I bring anything to his place. Fuck man even if you try sometimes you just can't win.

I've been on 6mg subs for two weeks and it has been good, my life wasn't in tatters before starting subs and my habit was relatively recent (half a year ish). I was using at least 0.5 of H at the very least 3-5 days a week beforehand. 

**I have decided I am going to try get high today no matter what. I do very much appreciate any concerns about interfering with my maintenance but it's happening regardless.** Whether this takes me putting a mountain of powder up my nose or having my friend hit me; **it's happening**.

My last dose of 6mg suboxone was 12 hours ago (and it is 9am here, won't be picking up till later and could wait till the evening to make it 24+ hours). 

Thus I would appreciate any advice regarding dosage differentials (even if approximate). If 0.1-0.2 insufflated got me high before the 6mgs of sub; how much should I insufflate on the sub? Lets say I had my friend hit me to better break through, how much should I have him load up? 

If I manage to get high today (full agonist binding achieved), I should obviously be skipping my suboxone dose tonight, but if I didn't, would I go into precipitated WDs?

Any advice is much appreciated.

I know the intranasal bioavailability of oxymorphone is 43% and the rectal bioavailability is 50.7%, so if I boof it I am getting slightly more bang for my buck. But which will be a better high?

I usually do oxy*codone* and when I do, I only take it orally. However, that's never given me the famous opiate ""rush"" I hear everyone talking about. From what I understand, you have to snort or IV to get the rush. Is that true? What about if you boof it?

Basically, I've been an occasional user of prescription opiates ever since I found an old bottle of vicodin in my parents' cabinet when I was a teen. I've been a regular pot smoker ever since around that time too, and I'm in my late twenties now, but despite trying all sorts of drugs I've never formed an addiction to anything besides my habitual (daily) smoking of the weed. Though I love the feeling I get from opiates, I knew that it was a dangerous game and I never escalated past the occasional painkiller that I'd come across (couple of surgeries, scripts from friends surgeries, etc) maybe a few times a year max. I'd never gone out of my way to purchase them on the street or anything, and no one in my social circle is a regular user (at least not that I'm aware of).

... Until this year. Be it a combination of boredom, depression about my employment/life situation, yearning for the feeling again, spending too much time browsing this sub, and figuring out that you can find oxy connects on craigslist, whatever reason you'd like to ascribe, I made my first street opiate transaction and got blues for the first time. Basically, I got a 10pack went on a little bender for a week before taking a month break. I definitely noticed that it was hard for me to keep away from them when I had them in my possession, but I knew enough to stay away from buying them again too soon, and honestly I didn't want to. I had no interest in becoming a physically-dependent opiate addict.

This was almost 6 months ago and honestly not much about my use has changed. I'm not buying ten packs, usually it's about 3 at a time, and maybe once every other week. I have kept it on a schedule where I have never once experienced physical withdrawal symptoms.  I do not feel that I rely on the pills, and I have turned my life around in terms of finding purpose, figuring out an employment situation that makes me happy, and I've never been more in love with my partner. Though, they do not know about my secret indulgence. That's honestly what gives me the most guilt--keeping this all hidden from them when I'm partaking. But usually, I take the drugs when they're not around because I love being high and giving myself some quality alone time. 

So, am I just a foolish idiot? I love opiates and I want to keep doing them because... well, I love them and the feeling they give me. I know that I don't want to go broke/into debt because of them, I know that I want to practice safe harm-reduction like using fentanyl test strips on new batches, and I definitely know that I don't want to get to the point where my body needs the oxy to feel okay. And I feel really confident in myself that I can keep this up. But like a lot of people, I read the posts on this sub about ""chipping being impossible"" and ""it's only a matter of time"" and a little part of me worries.

**TL;DR:** I've been chipping oxy for almost half a year now and I don't feel my life spiraling out of control. In fact, it's getting better. What's your take on what I'm doing?",1528652498.0

Fun story of trying to find all the dope connections in a one week bender below. 


So... FROM WHAT I REMEMBER.
What would you get, and why. 
60 each of these. I thought he said $100 for 60? But this was like a year ago, tho I'm sure he's still around if he's alive. I just need to know. :P I mean I've heard of $1 a mg but these are dillies.

So, 
> 1mg hydromophone IR
> 2mg hydromorphone IR

> 1mg hydromophone XR
> 2mg hydromorphone XR

> and 2mg little injectable vials?? either 60 or $100 of those. 




###########################################################




I'm just curious at this point. I wonder if this guy is even still around.  Legs are a big concern. I heard dillies don't last very long??I remember snorting them with next to no tolerance and enjoying them for hours. IDK, heroin lasted VERY, VERY LONG when I was first doing it. Heck. When I was shooting I made one point into 3 needles~! Sometimes I shoot one in the evening and two the next day! Or vice-versa. 

I met this disabled guy. He was mocking someone, and I think he's making fun of some ""kid"" about morphine,..fuck, I just had to pop in( See the thing is....0_0 I was on a relapse, AND, like a man on the run, I knew I was going to end, I knew I was going to crash, but before I did,fueled by iv coke & heroin,  I wanted ""MORE"". More variety. I wanted to find ""THE BEST"". and thru socializing-actually spending time and getting to know various people, looking for dealers, and talking to all sorts of people, I mean... may be a dead end or may punch you people,..I had tried SO MANY different sources of dope,  ALL-FUCKING-WEEK-LONG) I got the number of a prostitute with green teeth, that I will never - ever talk to - she said if I ever ""you know need a release"" I can call- I got that just because she might actually have a hookup down the line. I went to areas I've never been, got high with people I've never met. 

I freaked out a dealer in a bathroom. Caught up with him. Told him I know what he was doing, but just chill ""I'm networking"" and showed him a big chunk of dope. He shows me a bag of little bags like so what. Then doesn't wait for me to go to the bank machine. 

I give a girl a pack of smokes I find on the bus to track him down. This is after asking 10 people at the library if they knew where he went. 

HE WAS SELLING IN THE CORNER OF A CORNER STORE~!! I WAS LIKE OK. TOOK MY SHIT. Gave chicky a point, ""What about the cashier""... ""Dude, of course they know"" 

3 people came up to him for hand to hand while I watched that. Days later when the relapse was over that side of the corner store had a massive flag hanging, hiding this guys ""corner spot"" heh. It was really a corner spot. A corner, in the corner store, on the corner :P 

Where I met the wheelchair dude was right outside of there. 

So this kid was actually bragging, saying he gets hydromorphone cause his Dad is in the H.A., which in Canada is such a lame thing to say, but it happens all the time. So wheelchair guy said we all know he's full of shit. And he clearly didn't even understand what the drug is. ""Trust me, I do, I mean, look at me"" and he sorta waves his wrist and gibbled hand"" He's in a wheelchair, his neck looks like it's in a weird sort of crook, his hand barely extends. 

Anyway, I ask him about his pain management. Quickly learn he only uses pot medicine cause it actually deals with the inflammation. He gets lots of hydromorphone but sells it all. 

Says sometimes WD decides who has first pick. I'd imagine he gets sob stories every month, even from those stocking up SHEESH.



I'd laugh if everything was $60 for 100 pills. I've gotten dillies for some weed a few times and sorted and plugged it. And bottles of morphine for free. ALL BEFORE I EVER SHOT ANYTHING.  I also took some percs. meaningless amount. I really wish I had more experience with pills. 

At the time I remember thinking, FUCK, that sure sounds cheap~!!! But I was at the end of a relapse and I had been caught and was off to treatment again. I'd love to get 10 of those once a month. Hell, even a few every weekend. 

I know he's not a phony. And I've kept his number all this time.

Second thought is school and such. Next step is spin cycle.,"I have a complex situation. It will be easier to boil it down so I'm not pushing all that reading on anyone. I was slipping(didn't use) in transitional housing. The executive director overruled kicking me out. And from that time I went above and beyond. tbh even the original stuff was mostly lead by a guy who was a bully who literally bullied my female case worker right before she quit. 

Anyway, I was told-after the executive director left. That getting some plastic in the organics(I volunteered for the grossest job, one of many things I did to show appreciation. And ""taking a tone, while being polite and not using bad language, I'll admit that"".

Was now grounds for me to be ""moved on"".
They wanted to send me downtown. Right where I used to call the best dealer I've ever known. I went into, I have tons of money saved up from EI, I""m going to fucking use so much dope. I'm so depressed, they're taring me out of my community. 

I DIDN'T EAT OR SLEEP MUCH FOR 2 DAYS. 
But I got thru it. I'm going to move 5 - 10 minutes away. Rent a room and share everything else. Stay in school, doing my upgrading in the same complex where I used to live. Stay in this area. Stay using WorkBC-for school funding for college-help. 

Use the non-profit temp agency. 

However. Being free from people watching over me has the fantasies coming back a lot. I keep thinking. So if I don't take my methadone for half a day, and then do dope. Then wait for withdrawal the next day, take methadone like normal. 

I keep running thru how I can use while still keeping my methadone carries and making it all work. I know this isn't what I'm supposed to do. But I feel like I'm being pushed from the community I know, a place where I didn't use cause I had to not use dope to stay. But I refuse to leave this area and go downtown to another 2nd stage. Especially a place that's no joke where I would phone my guy and then walk a number of blocks to meet him.

If things work out one of these things will happen.
-I will use off and on, maintain my methadone carries situation and it will be all good. 
-I will use off and on and it will all go to shit.
-I will concentrate on meditation and how I'm into fitness and being healthy and I'll weigh even more than 170lbs any day now.

You need to understand weighing 170lbs is crazy for me, even before dope. I really do want to concentrate on health and fitness, and most of all school. But I've been single for a couple of years after getting clean and I've only been on a few dates. 

I'm just not satisfied with life over all. Dope keeps seeming like that old hobby that used to bring me so much piece. I keep telling myself I'll just use a bit here and there and still focus on school, getting the girl and all that.

Got this cute girl from work into me and i can't make a fkn move because i can't bring anyone into my life.  I spend like 2 hours a day making tea because my habit is so big, I can barely stay well now, takes a ridic dose to nod and i don't even fkn want it anymore. 

 I woke up 2 hours ago and i'm only half way through making my morning dose and i just started typing this instead.  I have a bunch of morphine and oxy there, i'll get to it eventually but fuck it i can't take this much longer.  My whole life revolves around staying well/high when i can afford it.  I work non stop yet i have no money, i can't stop working to deal with my pain because i need paper to pay bills and my habit, i can't stop my habit because i hate my job.  What a fucking cycle it's ridiculous.  It's going to take sooo much work to clean up and deal with my pain without drugs, I know exactly what must be done to escape this shit, it can be done but it's the hardest thing i've ever done.

All i wanna do is take my last 400mg of morphine and 500mg of oxy and go to sleep, thing is i'm not even 100&#37; that dose will kill me.

This cycle, it's nothing but misery and even mid nod there's no satisfaction because i know i'll wake up and need to do it again.  If you're just starting, fucking stop.

I know it effects the opiate receptors and all that, but for example.. it takes me about 200mg of oxy taken at once for me to have a good time. I take opiates strictly once every 7 days (I'm not dependent on opiates,¬† just have a high tolerance),¬† using Kratom everyday in between., 8Gs at 2x a day. I do NOT get withdraws in days I don't use either kratom OR oxy.

So 14 days ago I took 200mg. Then, 7 days ago, I take a 150mg dose assuming my tolerance dropped. I thought it was pretty weird that I didn't feel it as strongly as I expected. Yesterday, I take my full dose of 200mg. It's like I never even took 1 day off, as I barely felt the effects. 

Kratom must be responsible for this, right?? Has anyone else experienced this? Is it not strange that kratom is keeping my opiate tolerance at such a high level ?? There's no other explanation for this .... I am pretty shocked. I feel like my opiate receptors are not healing at all.

If you smoke a cigarette after having just put some heroin in your body, the cigarette intensifies the dope high by a lot. Because of my tolerance I literally never get that amazing feeling of slowly nodding out, unless I smoke a cigarette. Then, even if I microdosed, I find myself slowly drifting off. It's such a drastic change that if I'm out driving after having shot up, I have to resist the temptation to light a cigarette - even though I just shot up, I'd be alert and lucid until I finish my cigarette, only then would I start feeling sleepy.
This has happened with such consistency that there must be a scientific/chemical explanation for why this combination has such potent results. Does anyone here know why, or have any theories?",1528591126.0

After waiting in the ER for hours they finally call me back to do a xray, CT and something else. Then I wait some more.

Well around 6 this morning it's about time to get my abscess drained.

I decide to do a shot and sit back on the hospital bed and I fall out.

Shout out to the nurses who did the whole procedure while I was out so I didn't have to feel that pain (anyone who has has an abscess drained know that shit sucks)

Note I was still breathing, just very shallow, slow and my vital signs were low I guess.

Now that they're all done, what do you think they do next?

That's right! Narcan!

This was my first time ever getting narcand.

I jumped out of the hospital bed, confused

""What the fuck is going on?""
""How did I get here""

It was such a weird shitty feeling.
I felt like I could smell my brain burning or something.

I also bought myself a much needed new phone today, and more clothes to add to my disturbingly quickly growing hoard. All bought with my own hard earned money not from the wallet before someone asks.

Anyway the day I chose to get high I turned into a snowball because I was going down hill fast. Definitely one of my largest binges I‚Äôve ever had. It was mostly the one thing we aren‚Äôt suppose to bring up and then dope of course. 

So I got about a week off work to detox like I‚Äôve done multiple times the past couple years. I was worried about going cold turkey this time. I‚Äôve never really been worried whenever I plan to get clean but this time I was having anxiety attacks while I was still using and my depression flared up like a mother fucker. 

So I start the detox. First two days I‚Äôm so anxious I barely ate or left my room. My legs are really relentless and I‚Äôm having a hard time lying still. I was off a lot of klonopin and dispensary grade bud for these two days so maybe that‚Äôs how I got a full nights sleep. Which is weird because when I detoxed off a longer habit, not larger, but more consecutive days than this run, 2mg kpin would knock me out for 4 hours if I was lucky and then I‚Äôd be wide awake for the next 20 years. 

Starting day three I started taking two large doses of Kratom. Once when I wake up and another 10-12 hours later. The only WD symptom I‚Äôm feeling before the Kratom is restless legs and anxiety. 


From day three to day five I feel pretty much the same. No hot/cold flashes, my bones don‚Äôt ache, I‚Äôve been eating like a Samoan which has been great because now my pants actually fit and I don‚Äôt constantly like I‚Äôm sagging my pants like the cool kids did in middle school. 

Now it‚Äôs day 6 and I feel like I‚Äôm at baseline besides slight rls and anxiety but I‚Äôve been an anxious fucker my whole life so that‚Äôs nothing new. I could probably skip the Kratom from here on out and just deal with the minimal discomfort and I‚Äôm going the rest of the weekend benzo free. 

I just don‚Äôt understand how this happened and why this detox. JJ couldn‚Äôt have blessed me with almost pain free detox that time I was out of state for a week surrounded by family in the humid south, or when I lived with my super protective mother. Who made me go to the doctor because I was so dope sick I couldn‚Äôt pass it off as a cold or some shit and then I had to lie to her and my doctor who I‚Äôve been going to for a majority of my life and I think very highly of. 

This has to be the fourth or 5th time I‚Äôve intentionally kicked a habit of these two opiates so I know what it‚Äôs suppose to feel like. I can‚Äôt remember how long the binge was, no longer than two months, so maybe that‚Äôs why it was this easy? Now my last question is, would using put me into some sort of WD worse than what I went through this week? Of course the goal is to not touch the stuff ever again but if I stayed true to that the first time I said that I wouldn‚Äôt be typing this post. Sorry for the novel I just haven‚Äôt posted on this sub much and even when sober I love this sub

For lurkers and new users you guys need to know that about these opioids and this addiction is that it doesn't fucking go away. Your love for pills and dope will overpower everything else in life and it will fuck you over no matter who you are or where you are from.

Before discovering this sub I thought I was different in the sense that I loved opiates more than anyone else that was the case with everybody I know in real life but my thoughts changed when I started coming on here. I've been on subs the last 8 months with just a few 1-2week benders in between. I've been living a new city and those benders only happen when I visit my hometown. I have no connections here besides for weed and don't do dope anymore and in my opinion I think pills are way harder to cold cop. 

Now I have been away from home for 2 years with going home occasionally and was home all of last summer where I developed a bad crack addiction but that's a story for another day. I have no friends or connections in the new cities I've been living in the last 2 years I can find weed and occasionally stims or benzos but no fucking steady pill connect and to top all of this I haven't been laid since last summer so I'm coming up on a year where I've barely talked to any girls. I have terrible anxiety when it comes to that shit and when I try and go places(20cant drink yet) I can't bring myself to approach anybody and just end up leaving. It's been frustrating and have no idea why I'm like this. I tell myself everyday I'm going to go out and either try and talk to girls or try and cold cop pills and that's the only thing that keeps me sober is that I'm going to do it ""tomorrow"".

Today I was alone my fam actually went back to my hometown and I was pissed I couldn't go with to go scoop 30 blues so I was like fuck it I'm gonna try and score here so after work I went to some methadone clinics and there I saw junkies coming in and out and I couldn't bring myself to approach anybody! Its like how I can't approach girls it's the same fucking thing I left and tried going back but whenever the moment comes I can't fucking do it. Why do I have this horrible approach anxiety of talking to new people. I know the obvious answer is to just go out and fucking do it get over it but I can't. I just have thoughts of getting rejected or called a cop or just being embarrassed and I just go home and smoke bud all day snorting subs eating good food I don't talk to anybody. 

In high school I had a lot of friends and didn't have this bad of social anxiety but ever since I've moved with my fam and I'm not going to school anymore I feel like such a fucking loser everyday I come on here looking at pics of pandas/blues/dope and wish it was me. I guess the tables just turned on me since the end of high school it's such an embarrassing thing to think already that time is the peak of my life so far i used to deal bud go to party's snort blow and hang with girls all the time now I fucking hate myself sit inside all day I'm scared to talk to ppl no matter what I tell myself and really just hate my fucking myself and my life is a joke. 

If you are just starting I would advise to quit I've been hooked over 3 years and had problems with stims and benzos before that just don't be surprised if similar things happen to you as well I see common feelings shared by all of us. Another big thing I can't seem to shake is feelings of envy.  It's burning a whole in me because I can feel the intense jealousy to people who don't have a fucking gorilla on their back telling me to get high all day everyday I dream about this shit is fucking tearing me apart both of my parents and both of our extended families have a history of addiction my parents have the same doc as me and are on subs too. I'm just wired this way although I had plenty of chances to stop I don't I'm definitely  not blaming it on genetics just saying this shit was bound to happen to me.

May I begin by saying I in no way promoting what I'm doing, but saying that my question stems from is it possible to not have physiological dependence on DHC/Codeine after daily use.

I mainly ask as i've been going daily use for nearly 3 months now and 3 weeks ago I cold turkey'd for 1 week, mainly cause I wanted to see if I really was addicted after over 2 months. My daily dose has been 150 mg and since those 3 weeks I've been tapering that down. However, what I noticed was when I went off I didn't experience any of the typical withdrawal symptoms, maybe just being a bit cranky and mainly psychological effects e.g. cravings, does DHC differ in that it's just less likely to cause physical dependency or cause of its half life? Or was it just me not taking massive doses which helped?",1528552416.0

However whenever I do codeine or codeine derivatives, whether it be pills or syrup, I get really really sick. Especially the day after. 

Why is this? Is it because more pills = more shitty filler = bad for your stomach? Or simply because you need to eat a lot of codeine/weaker opiates (300-400mg) to catch a buzz and that ruins your liver and stomach?

The addiction has been bad for 1 or 2 years now, and I am being given prescription tablets that are not mine. The over-the-counter version (lesser dose) has been banned about 6 months ago, so technically I should not be in possession of codeine at all. SO, this leads to my problem.

I really need to kick this addiction. I know it's not heroin but it's badly affecting my life, and I constantly crave it. The issue is that opiate based painkillers are the ONLY thing that even puts a dent in my period pain. I get extremely severe monthly pain, and without pain relief I would literally be contemplating suicide. It is that bad. It's intolerable.

I am scared to go to the doctor and ask for them to see if there's anything they can do. They will NOT prescribe opiates.

I liked the legality and thus availability and lack of consequences kratom had. But then my tolerance got so high and I got tired of taking it every day so my friend offered me suboxone to keep me well when I couldn't get any kratom, and ever since then I started taking suboxone. But honestly... I love suboxone. It feels really good to me and I've been using it for 6 years, so I have like a 6 year opiate tolerance under my belt so, I can hang lol. I was taking near 8mg twice a day of subs which I'm now prescribed thankfully. I was getting them off the street but then I almost got caught when they found 2mg strip as I was going to jail for marijuana. I said it was my script, and they never brought it up again. So I got a script after that.
Besides all of this I've always had a very methodical way of dosing and keeping myself at a fairly reasonable tolerance level. I dose twice a day, 3 times max, and it's usually always the same dose. It's worked for me for years.
I also basically just let myself become a drug addict because I had nothing else going on for me after high school. I was all alone I just said fuck it because I was so depressed and in a lot of pain and kratom helped a lot. And I'm still basically totally alone still 6 years later, no gf no friends so that makes it impossible to stop using. I went to a crisis place once to detox and they let me back home in like 5 days and I wanted to get right back to using, but I ended up sticking it out 6 weeks and then relapsing on christmas day. 
I guess this all sounds pretty bad but my parents know and I still live with my dad (at fucking 24) and didn't really work for most of my addiction just hustled, you guys know how it is pawning shit, stealing change, stealing games etc. But I finally got a job a year and a half ago so I'm doing better for myself now and not acting like a ""junkie"". My family I guess still thinks I'm clean, but they probably know it's a lie? I dunno man. I can't make anything of myself staying so high all the time but it's the only way I can handle life, I guess? It's a miracle I didn't try heroin and get addicted to that in my bad phase, I was really depressed and wanted to do it for a while. But I figured I was taking enough of a risk as it is using with my sleep apnea, didn't wanna OD.
The other thing is, I have strong willpower, I can kinda quit whenever I want. I just don't wanna deal with withdrawals right now and I don't have time for it. I've quit plenty of times over the years as I've run out of money or gotten caught or whatever.
So basically what I'm asking, is does this sound typical to you?Or am I different? What do you guys think about this shit? My life I guess? Am I a typical junkie loser just rationalizing my bullshit?

Honestly, I'm pretty damn blessed to be able to still walk away, basically unscathed. No charges, No hospital visits, No OD's, just an empty wallet and a black heart. Those can be fixed with time. Hopefully, this will last as long as I need it to. I have some very uncomfortable days ahead of me.

I love y'all. Please be safe, Come here if you need help. Everyone around this sub, are for the most part, trying to reduce harm in the users of these drugs. If you are new to this drug, just do yourself a favor, and STAY AWAY. I PROMISE you, everyone will tell you the same. It just ain't worth the life and the shit it causes.

For example how does a morphine dose feel compared to an equivalent dose of heroin or hydromorphone?

I have a question I have really been struggling with the last couple days and I don't have anyone that I can talk to about this stuff, so here we go.

Am I really sober?

I graduated from college and made a super hard and heart breaking decision to relocate from the Midwest to the west coast. I cried like a little bitch when I had to pack up my diploma and belongings and leave my amazing friend group. I moved to the West Coast because I love the weather, the culture, the women...  I also have a decent job out here. Another HUGE REASON I left the midwest for the west coast is because I wanted to be in an environment where I didn't have access to opiates on a bi-weekly basis. Where I live now, I don't know anyone who does drugs, and that is a good thing. (I still go through intense moments of cravings if that matters)

Anyways, here is the problem. I have been sober for four months and my life is okay right now. Its really boring, but I am working and I am approaching five months of being sober. HOWEVER, I know that deep down, if junkie Jesus presented himself tomorrow.... I wouldn't be able to help myself. If a bottle of pink 10s fell from the sky, I would not have the power to say no. I would be crushing up lines on the sidewalk.

So am I really sober? I out myself in a position where I am living in a nice place, working, and I am technically clean on PURPOSE... But if I was given the opportunity to dance with the Devil again, I would do the tango. ",1528516380.0

And I loved these, in part bcuz I would get them for $10 a pop, bcuz I knew someone who got these rx'd, there first time he told me about them he described them as like morphine, as well as the first time he got fentanyl patches, I agree, that any strong opiate especially heroin, is technically like morphine, especially heroin, or diacetylmorphine.. but I immediately got on the internet and looked up ""Avinza""& to my delight found out they were indeed morphine sulfate extended release capsules:).  I purchased 2/$20 and opened the 1st one up to discover beads inside, @ 1st I was not very efficient at crushing then into a fine powder, but with time became very proficient at it..I'd dump the beads into a shot-glass and had a guitar string winder that's handle was perfectly suited to crushing them up!!  I then would take a $ bill and snort that amazingly bitter powder, and wait for bliss, and even though it would take a few mins to ""come up"" it never failed me! At first, I could do about 75/80% of a 120mg and be high as hell, but unfortunately as w/any opiate, tolerance occurred, and I would do one whole pill per dose, then one and a half, then 2.... I definitely was spoiled with a amazing hook-up.... And payed the price in the long run, physical addiction.  But I then started taking oxy (the OG, ""OC's"", God I'd do unmentionable things to get my hands on a few 80mg OC's again!!). And supplement, that with a nice stay off fent. Patchs I had collected for quite some time.... And then I found opana, then heroin.. at first insufflated, then I.v.  now I love iv heroin probably more than any other opiates, but if I could get those Avinza Cap's again for $10/a piece, I would take them over street H.

They cold turkey'd me off my 2-3g a day heroin habit on top of 120-200mg of methadone, and tapered me off of 60mg of diazepam in 4 weeks. This always sounded impossible to me but now it's done and I'm physically fine. I had to get sent to hospital my first week for lock jaw that was so intense I was fainting and excessive vomiting a few days later. They don't believe in any comfort meds and you're still expected to do duties when you can stand, it's fucking gnarly. After 2 months I'm used to it now, and then pain is gone, but fuck I just don't know about staying sober. 

The thought of never doing heroin again makes me straight up miserable, like I want to recover, I wanna stop ruining my relationships and job opportunities, I want to stop stealing, lying and cheating. I wanna stop living to nod out waking up with burn marks on my clothes and dead cig butts between my fingers, only caring about vinegary white powder. I would actually have to use methadone as well as heroin because heroin in any dose didn't seem to get rid of withdrawal properly. I also had to smoke crack as well to actually feel good not just well. 

But now my minds at, 3 months drug free, not even weed, what will heroin feel like. That first shot, will it feel like the first time? I rationalize that I'm gonna stay sober for a year sort my shit out and then get back to it.. but in my heart I know that it won't be long before I go back. I'm getting drug tested on a random day once a week so I'm already plotting to use straight after my first test. I don't know what's wrong with me.. 

It's like I got my family, my own well being and everything else in one hand and heroin in the other and the heroin hand is winning..

After a 45 minute drive we meet up, he hands me a wad of paper towel, I drop it in my lap and I'm on the way back home again, another 45 minute drive.


Before I hit the major expressway, I realize I need gas. Pull off, hop out and go pay and pump. Hop back in and homeward bound.


I reach my city and stop off at Walgreens to pick up some works. Hop out of the truck and it hits me like a bucket of freezing cold water... those were on my lap earlier when I got out for gas...


Look at my girlfriend and beg her to tell me she grabbed them, plead with her.  Nope. She doesn't have them.


I want to break down in tears. I just drove 45 minutes home, I know they're long long gone. But I have to go check, right? Obviously I have to go check.



Thus begins the longest drive of my life. My mind is racing, thinking of all the coulds and maybes. I keep telling myself, ""why would anyone pick up a wad of paper towel?"", hanging on that thread of hope that just maybe.. maybe..


Finally get off the expressway and I can see the gas station, still fighting with myself. ""they have to be there/there's no possible way those are still there"". I pull in and up to the pump I was at...

*And there they fucking are*, staring at me, wrapped in the most beautiful paper towel I've ever seen. They hadn't moved an inch, incredibly.


Needless to say, it was one of the most exhilarating moments of my life.

Gabapentin is also available OTC, it doesn't get me high at all aside from causing minor CEV's.

So I want to do a Cold Water Extraction to 18 pills, each containing 8mg codeine. If done correctly should I get a minimum of 120mg codeine? Would that be a good dose on its own for a 118 lbs male with zero tolerance?

And most importantly, would Gabapentin possibly potentiate the codeine high? Or would it lower the bioavailability like it would with hydrocodone?

And lastly, assuming I were to consume 120mg codeine, 900mg gabapentin, 540mg caffeine, some APAP leftovers, and 100mg diphenhydramine (for potentiation and possible nausea/itching): **is that too much for my liver to handle at once?**",1528463905.0

8piumq,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8piumq/the_urge_is_just_so_strong/,5,https://redd.it/8piumq,PontiffTheGreat,The urge is just so strong.,"Family found out about my use a little while ago (while it was also getting out of hand, even though I sniffed 3/4 days a week), but yeah I ended up on suboxone which i've been on for a week now. It holds me great, not worrying about getting money, dope or withdrawing is actually amazing.

Im seeing my doctors, psychiatrist, addiction specialist and psychologist every single week. Im engaging in treatment and beginning to learn to deal with cravings.

But the urge to get high is so fucking strong. First few days the 6mg of sub gave me a long arse buzz. But after that I found myself level yet still wanting to get high. I binged on xanax for 3 days (I know wht im doing with these dont worry), then cannabis and dabs for a few days (I dont normally smoke any weed so I was getting right cooked). Then binged on lyrica (god its awesome) for two days and today when I went to pick up more, dude pulls out his meth pipe, has a hit, gestures to hand it to me and I just say fuck it why not (first time doing methamphetamine). Hand it back and by thr time ive snorted the 150mg of lyrica I had cut up I was feeling fucking INCREDIBLE.

Here I am 20 miutes later. Feeling fantastic. Still on subs but I keep finding ways to get fucked.",1528454353.0

I found a few legit dealers that were very low key and used weird code words. Dude was legit but the add was kind of old and only had H now, no oxy.I don‚Äôt fuck with H. 

Met some dude in my area who fucked with shrooms, weed and coke. Could maybe get some benzodiazepines but never got back to me. Benzodiazepines interest me, but I have a med card, my girl has an ounce of shrooms and I personally  fucking hate any sort of stims, so it was a no.
Those were the Legit dudes.

The rest of them were the dudes in question living in really sketchy areas. Claim to have every drug under the sun In limitless quantity. Straight up advertising on Craig‚Äôs list, no code words or slang. Charging you up the ass, to either get robbed or get ripped off, I assume. 

One of those dudes had lower than average prices but only accepted PayPal or bitcoin but PROMISED he respected the costumer and wold come 14 miles at 1am to deliver as soon as he got the payment. Lmao. What makes me sad is I bet that had worked for him a lot in the past. It‚Äôs actually kind of genius. 

Claim your selling drugs. But only accept bit coin or PayPal. Never show up. Easy money. And there‚Äôs not much fools can do about. What are you going to do go the cops claiming you got scammed trying to buy illegal drugs? And even if you do, they would get charged with the lesser crime of fraud (does scamming fools trying to buy illegal drugs even count as fraud?) rather than, soliciting a controlled substance.

If you commit a drug relates crime (which all opiate addicts will, unless they die first) and get caught while in jail they will have the opportunity to opt into a drug diversion program.

This program helps you find a job and housing if you agree to attend meetings, drug counciling, and most importantly get the vivitrol shot before release. You must comply with drug testing and get your shot every month for a year..the shot is completely free.

If you breach contract a warrent will be issued for you arrest, if you complete the program your charges will be dismissed.",1528447035.0

And am still trying to figuring out what this here is. But anyways I made a mistake. I found a great new supplier. I get 7g #3 H for 110‚Ç¨. Thats super cheap. After I am out of this shit here I will test the dope if its as good as everyone says. But I even dont know if I wanted to be clean. I wanted it for my family and my friends. But for me I didnt wanted it. I still love heroin. And with that plug and if the dope is good. I will be able to handle my money way better. 10g costs me a 150‚Ç¨. So I am 14 days clean. Maybe my tolerance went down so 10g lasted me before 2 weeks. Maybe they will last now longer? IDK all I know is that I will relapse. I am planing it in my head all the time. And it will be perfect. I will definitly be out of here next week. So I will relapse next week. Be back in the game and eventually die in the next few months if I keep consuming like that. So fuck it. I cant change myself. The last 1 and 1/2 years nobody recognized my consume. So now when I will start shooting again like I did before I came here I will shoot in hands and foots and no one will see it. I imagine it in my had that it goes like this hopefully. If not I will have to live on the streets or in my car. But i dont care. I miss my H so much. I cant stop using it. ,1528443906.0
