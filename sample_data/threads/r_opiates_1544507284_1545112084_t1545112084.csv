I'm looking in to pain management and opiates to control what are extremely painful urinary tract infections. I've got a lot of surgical and medical history and it's a whole spiel, I've posted about it before, but it's besides the point of this question.

One of the ""side effects"" (rather euphoric properties) that I like about opiates is the almost tingling numbness that they provide your body. How your muscles feel extremely comfortable and just like you weigh a million pounds and sink very lovingly into your bed. 

I don't want to use whatever opiates I may be prescribed for that purpose. One, it'd be an increased risk of addiction and even though I'm fairly certain I don't have a huge addictive potential, I don't want to take the risk, two it adds to my tolerance REALLY quickly, and three, perhaps most simply, I'll fuckin' run out lmao. 

What alternatives provide this sort of sensation and calming effect to the body? I have restless legs and I'm considering seeing a neurologist or my pcp to see if I have some peripheral neuropathy from my kidney failure because I am constantly uncomfortable or in some degree of minor pain. Until then, what are some options? Kratom seems to be a big one but I don't feel like the effect is strong enough to help me much, unless of course I just have less than stellar strains.",1545103285.0

Anyone else feel this way?","I'm having to find another job, and mostly all the call backs are from restaurants (fast food, etc). At 29, 6 months away from being 30, it's extremely discouraging having to work around pretty much all high schoolers and the one or two 40-50 some year old managers that seem like they just try and fit in with the high schoolers, rather than being a good AM or manager in general.

So it's either playing cook in a burger joint or waitressing until Ive been there long enough to qualify as a bartender. It's somewhat degrading also, and the way I get looked at by customers or judged out loud (and anyone who's worked in the business knows this happens a lot), it just adds to the depression.

I think about going back to school and getting another degree (I have my B.A in Pharmacology but due to my charge will NEVER be able to work in a pharmacy or not for another 20-30 years) in computer programming, UX, and maybe getting into the whole tech field but I can't afford to earn another degree and have it go nowhere, whether by fault or because no one wants to hire me.

I hate that I'm judged so highly by my background that I'm barely able to compete with people who aren't even half as qualified. I hate having to work at shit jobs and play dumb with everyone because ""if u went to uh.. College then uh.. Why u here then?"" I stress myself out so much and see myself doing so much better eventually that it all feels like a daydream compared to my actual life.

I want to be somebody. I want to be successful so much its all I think about, even when I think I'm getting ahead I'm so much further behind than I actually am. I don't want to be in my old age unable to work or still making minimum wage no matter how much it's raised.

Idk, maybe I'm just in my feelings. But as an addict with charges, theres so much more that defines me and makes me. Unfortunately that's not how the work force sees it. Trying to keep my head up as my next job will probably be waiting tables at Buffalo Wild Wings (I'm serious).

He had an opiate addiction while living here and couldn't keep the addict in him at bay so he searched for a treatment center far away from home.

If it's abused by a percentage of the population it almost certainly makes me extremely euphoric. When I describe what alcohol feels like to other people they say that it doesn't affect them in the way I describe it. Marijuana gives me full blown auditory and visual hallucinations.  Caffeine at times can give me enough pleasure where I just sit with a body high that feels like I'm in a bathtub. I""ve had to give up all substances because every one of them caused me severe problems. (Including caffeine, when you are averaging 15-20 cups per day, you've probably got a problem lol) That being said the only substances I have not gotten addicted to are the opiates. It's not that they aren't addictive for me, it's just that I enjoy them more than every other substance combined and then doubled, so I've been very careful for years to make sure I don't do them daily. This has been helped by the fact that to get high on an opiate for 3-4 hours is 50 bucks. It's worth it, but I can't afford to do it that often. Then a friend of mine didn't have any other opiates on hand so I got suboxone at a discount. I had brought 50 bucks with me so my friend gave me 8 8mg subs. I told him ""Ok I'll probably do 4 of these now and then do 4 later tonight"" And he was like ""how high is your tolerance??"" I said ""it's at zero"" ""He's like you might want to do half""  I said ""Oh ok so do 2 now and then 2 later"" He said "" No half of one"" and I was like...ok. Boy am I glad he said that. I did half and I was FLOORED for like 16 hours. And I just CANT BELIEVE... that I have 7.5 of these things left.  They are AMAZING. For reference, I've never shot dope or done dope.

Very long, very interesting, very fun yay.","Alright so this was back in 2016 a little over 2 years ago.  I was in my last year of undergrad to get my chemical engineering degree.  I made 2 trips a week down to a town close to a border (this was usually a 12 hour round-trip and my running mate and I always went there, picked up, turned around and came right back.  This gave us the time to go to all the classes we needed to, dip out, and arrive back in the early morning hours to get to our 8 a.m.s if we needed to.  Sometimes we just said fuck class (I did, a lot, because I was smart and most of my classes I really didn't need to go to unless I wasn't understanding the material, so I would teach myself in-between times of inebriation and times of sickness).  We usually picked up 1-5 pieces (if you don't know what a piece is, it's 25gs aka a mexican oz), if we picked up 5 we would usually only do just that one trip for that week because, well we simply still had product left.

We as a duo sold to a select group of people, anywhere from 5-10 on any given week.  We were wholesalers, so we never sold to your typical user, although some of the people we dealt with used.  I never went in too deep with what these people were doing but I always asked them, ""do you use?"" - it's important to know who the users are or not, you've always got to be on your toes with these ones and never drop your guard.  Also if they told me know and there were signs that they used I just assumed, so pretty much I just assumed everyone used, can't be too careful.  Now my buddy usually kept half the product at his place and I kept half at mine.  He lived alone whilst I lived with my brother, we did this incase something happened to either spot, the *meetings* were also done at his place.  I was a very high functioning addict, my brother never knew about anything (we lived together for 3 years and were close) until events I will go into later flip the light switch on to the world.  Business was booming, prices literally 7xd once we made our trek back up into our college town.  Both my buddy and I used, I quietly fucked with the needle on the side while I smoked it in front of him (didn't want him knowing I used the needle, as he had used such pretentious slander towards those who did).  It may not have ruined our friendship, probably not since it was my connect.  Every weekend was a god damn party, as you can assume we lived in a pretty big college town, so we would flaunt our shit etc etc...

Now that was just a little backstory as to where I was at with my life at that point and what all was going on.

Everything was going good until a mutual friend of my running mate and I decided to come visit us and hang for the weekend.  He brought some fentanyl with him, which I was cool with because I was knowingly doing a substance, I just took it easy smoking little bit by bit.

Next thing I know I hear something loud like a fall out on the balcony area.  I lift my nodding ass forehead off the ottoman and go outside to find our mutual friend, let's call him T, seizing on the ground foaming at the mouth.  His pulse was gone by the time I could even reach his jugular vein, blood was seeping out of his ears - he was gone but I could take that answer.  I live right by a hospital so I thought I could get him there quicker than an ambulance coming, also the fact we had lots of drugs, cash, weapons etc at the place.  T was D.O.A combination of the OD causing him to fall and cause blunt force trauma to his head by hitting concrete.  So....one of my best friends dies of an OD, what do I do?

Next day (was Monday at 3pm) I go to the bar, immediately order 4 pickle backs and a beer, slam it, order 4 more, and slammed it again.  Bartender tells me I should probably slow down, I then said , ""fuck that I need to forget about some shit for today, then I'll worry about what I do tomorrow."" (Quoted in police report, now I probably said something like that, but who knows I said a lot of shit that afternoon at the bar).  Bartender didn't notice my intoxication and kept feeding me what I ordered.  I ended up having 13 shots and 8 beers on my tab in a span of 2 hours (now I know I forsure bought 2 girls shots, so I don't think I drank all of that, but I was in fuck you reckless mode, and at this point I'm fucking toasted).

I pay and this is where shit starts to get very blackout-ish.  I live about half a block from the bar and I had walked there and politely (yeah politely) declined a taxi service to come get me and deliver me to a daycare service to be looked after.  Now me being a jackass drunk I was stumbling in the middle of the road at 5 pm on a Monday evening when a guy in a truck rolls down his window and says ,""hey asshole get the fuck out of the road you drunk dumbass"", or something similar to that.  At this point I'm almost back to my place, turns out this fucker lives at the same complex as me. Now I ain't no Bitch.

I saw him park in his driveway and I start running like a drunk idiot to confront this guy for just speaking the truth.  Yea I shouldn't have been walking in the middle of the road, but fuck you I'm DRUNK you DICK!  I bang on his window, he gets out, we exchange some vulgarity (this dude was probably mid/late thirties and easily had 40 pounds on me), then words turn into a scuffle.  I'm now going to town on this motherfucker, then he yells to his wife to call the police and go grab his gun.  Now drunk me knows this means bail, my brain should comprehend, and it does, so I get off of him and retreat back to my place. 

Now this is where shit begins to get iffy/sticky/indisputable.  I'm in full black out mode now, like gone GONE.  He alleges that I came back to his place after walking away knowing he had a gun, not only that, but says I came back with a knife.  Now drunk me didn't think that bringing a knife to a gunfight would be a bad idea? (I would hope to think my brain would know not to do this, and I fully believe this guy took advantage of my inebriation and knew I wouldn't be able to back up a story with only his girl as a witness).

He says I had a pocket knife, which I always carry, so I wouldn't have walked to my house to grab it I knew I had it, so this guy fabricated shit to not get into any trouble because the only witness was his gf/fiancé/wife and I was to black out to remember anything.

After this is all alleged although I have settled in court so ? Yea lol

He says I threatened him with my pocket knife and stated that if I started moving towards him he would shoot me...well BANG got a .45 hollow-point slug to the abdomen from 5-6ft away. Drop to my knees, try to get up...stumble....more stumbling...final drop, white lights everywhere (now I think these are from the operating room, if you've ever been in one there's all stainless steel shit and bright lights so I think it was that as I don't believe in god, but something did save me, doctors are my higher being).

Since he had already called the cops they were already on there way so literally an ambulance was there a few minutes after I dropped.  Blood was draining out of my body so fast, taken to the UMC trauma center level 1 (university medical center, the highest level of trauma there is in the US it may be 3, or 1, I want to say 3 but I don't want to look it up so it had the best trauma surgeons in the region) in critical condition (not good). 

My BAC was .281 (pretty high to be that functional, but I guess not) so the first surgery lasted about 8 hours and they kept my chest open for like 10 days, the pain was unFUCKINGbearable.  Nothing helped, Alternating IV fentanyl 100 mcg every 2 hours and IV 4mg dilaudid every 2 hours, so every hour I was getting something.  Now I told them that I was an addict and that shit wasn't doing anything, so they crushed up an unknown mg amount of methadone and pushed it down my NG tube (tube that goes from your nose to your stomach) on top of all the IV shit and still nothing was working.  Next day before going into my 2nd surgery I asked if they could keep me in a medically induced coma for like a week-10 days so I didn't have to go through all this pain and they said only if your conditions lead to it.  Well my body wanted me to go through that pain so I'd be able to handle anything life ever throws my way in the future...and I'm glad my body did that.

Was in the ICU for 10 days then upstairs in the regular ward for another 10 days.  Ruptured bladder (had a catheter (the one up you p-hole) in for 31 days...fucking A man) heavy damage to all of the sections of my intestines (lead to me having a colostomy bag which luckily I got reversed 4 months later).  The bullet went in about an inch below my below button and an inch to the right when looking down at your feet.  It ended up in my left buttock pretty close to the center of my body, which it could've easily hit my spine.  Since it was a hollow-point bullet it sends off a shock wave and the bullet expands to about 2x the regular diameter and does as much damage as possible as they're designed to do, so a lot of shit got fucked up, but I'm lucky nothing too vital was hit like my heart or lungs or liver.  Everything was just bruised/inflamed as fuck except my bladder which was ruptured and my intestines which were torn the eff apart.

I'm bed-bound for the next 3 months and have a nurse coming to my house everyday to change extensive and tricky bandages that only specific nurses can do (we still keep in contact to this day, she's dope as fuck, her name was Shirley haha and she was the sweetest fucking lady).  I left the hospital with shitty pain meds and shitty muscle relaxers and she relayed my messages better than calling to change my meds and she personally prescribed me .5 xanax 4 times a day.  So everyone who was over my care at the hospital knew that I was an addict, but you can't give nothing to someone suffering from GSW (gun shot wound) and multiple surgeries, that's just unethical and could actually get you in trouble.

So everything goes well, I survived...went on to have 4 more surgeries, and just recently (a couple of months ago) I actually had the bullet removed from my ass.  It's crazy as fuck looking at it. Motherfucker is huge, and mean looking. Was clean clean for like 6 months, but couldn't take the pain and went to PM to get a script so I take prescribed meds now with the exception of a couple blues here and there.

Alright let's get on to the legal issues, the state eventually put out an arrest warrant (aggravated assault w/ a deadly weapon - Threat)  after appropriate time for me to heal from surgeries (I was supposed to go in for an arrest and release, which means you just go there and pay bond/bail and leave).  Well I moved back to my hometown with my parents to heal more then had another surgery, and my dad lived in London, UK and me and my mom were going over there to visit him for 2 months and guess what?  I get arrested at the gate before my flight because the goddamn DA did not let my lawyer know he put out the warrant on me which he was supposed to do.  I tell my mom everything is fine I'll answer their questions and I'll get on the next flight out of here (was flying from the US).

Questions lead to them telling me I had a warrant and was going to have to go to jail.  So I spend 2 and a half days in jail (it took them that long to process me before I could bond out) and another fucking thing they set my bond at $100k and it was out of county so you have to pay %15 to bail out.  Well both my parents are in London, but luckily I had money saved up and my brother bailed me out and I paid him back then took oath on it at the bond company so I took liability back, as I had to put up $100k worth of shit incase I didn't show up for court because then they would be liable for that money.

6 months later I had court and plead out with 7 years probation.  Which I guess was kind of a win and kind of a loss.  My lawyer was very old, knew everyone at the court even the elected DA very personally so I truly believe he worked out the best deal for me.  They first came at me with 5 years in jail and 5 years probation so no jail is a win for me.

I now have a little under 6 years of probation left, chronic sciatic nerve pain which I get a hydrocodone script for, PTSD and anxiety which I get xanax, temazepam, and lunesta for. But I'm still here on this earth. Idk why, I truly don't, I should have died man, even the doctors said that (rephrased of course they didn't just tell me you should've lol).  I can't tell you how many times these doctors wouldn't answer my questions about wether or not I'll live or wake up from this surgery...that procedure....fuck man.  It was god damn hell, but now I can handle fucking anything, this withdrawal ain't shit! Fucking it right up the ass lol...but seriously I'm glad I went through that shit.  It made me realize how fucking reckless I was and the terrible mistakes I was making and I needed to change.  Since I gobble down all my scripts so quickly and pick up blues every once in a while I guess I didn't mean much now...hmm

Well that took a while, ask questions if you want I know I left a shit load out, I've got pics of the bullet, my incisions (gory), and a shit load of hospital bands.

TLDR: sold pieces, was in college, got shot, big owwie, bad shitty, alive and sort of thriving now.

Since I need to wait an even longer time in w/ds to switch on buprenorphine from methadone. Would I be able to switch from methadone to codeine if my tolerance is low enough? Then switch from codeine to bupe with no precipitated wds (as i did it before).

I want to switch to codeine because I wouldnt get precipitated wds on a small codeine dose, ex: 60mg when I try to go back to bupe.

a6xxzy,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/a6xxzy/im_on_methadone_today_a_housemate_accidentally/,182,https://redd.it/a6xxzy,ChaoticHood,"I’m on methadone. Today, a housemate “accidentally” hit me with Narcan, thinking that I was OD’ing while taking a nap.","It sounds insane, I know. Turns out that the guy wasn’t all there to begin with, mentally. But after “trying” to wake me from a nap, he thought I must be OD’ing and hit me with Narcan. By trying to wake me, he said he touched my cheek and I didn’t wake up, so he took it upon himself to hit me with the dose. He didn’t tell anyone else in the house, a recovery house full of alcoholics and addicts, what he was doing. He walked by at least 5 people to get the Narcan, we keep it available for emergencies in case of an actual overdose, which we have had happen. But rather than get anyone to help or alert them to what he thought was going on with me, he instead grabbed and administered Narcan. When he then told someone and they woke me up a few minutes later, he then informed them and myself what he had done. 

I’ve been through an overdose and subsequent Narcan dose and the brutal withdrawal that it brings, being a heavy user during my active. The fear gripped me as I knew what was coming. I’m on a methadone maintenance program and haven’t touched dope in 7 months. But I’m on 135mg of methadone daily since getting clean. I felt the tightness in my chest start and knew what comes next. There’s no way to brace for it other than to just pray and know you’re about to be absolutely fucked. Nothing is going to really help with what’s coming. I broke down for a minute and cried, scared, knowing I was about to go through full blown withdrawal again even though I’ve been doing everything I’m supposed to - making meetings, holding down jobs, getting my life back together, doing really really well. 

Ten minutes later I was in full on, violent withdrawal. Since getting clean, I never thought I’d have to experience that again, but thanks to this person’s inexperience and complete disregard, I suffered through it again. And it was just as brutal as I remember. 

Now, I know maybe he thought he was trying to help or doing the right thing. And maybe he was in his own twisted way, but the fact that the next guy was able to wake me just by shaking my leg, and the fact that he didn’t tell a single person what he was about to do was troubling enough, as maybe they would’ve stopped him from just going ahead with it or tried harder to wake me up from my nap. I was literally in bed in my pajamas so I don’t know what made him think it was suspicious in the first place. Like I said, he’s been giving me weird vibes since arriving at the house and I didn’t think he was all together there in his head, but I just minded myself and kept him at arms length. 

Then the worst part and what actually angered me as, I could maybe forgive what he did under the guise of he was trying to save someone he thought was dying, he had the gall to argue with me as I was going in to withdrawal that Narcan doesn’t cause withdrawal or doesn’t get you high, and that I must’ve been using for this to happen. Trying to justify what he had done. Maybe he thought he was going to earn a hip hip hooray and be the hero of the house for “saving” me? Who knows his thought process. I snapped at him about being on maintenance and what was about to happen, what he had put me in to and he continued to shirk the blame, remorseless and completely emotionless. 

I hope it doesn’t make him hesitate in the future when someone actually needs help, but also I hope that he understands that administering something like that without knowing what you’re doing is dangerous. I thought I was going to need hospitalization, but after about 45 minutes of pure agony in the bathroom, I managed to compose myself enough to make it to bed and pass out from exhaustion and sleep through the rest of the ordeal. I woke up about 5 hours later and I feel fine now, but oof, was that a rough ride that I thought I had rid myself of. I can only hope that through the rest of my recovery, no one accidentally Narcans me again during my afternoon nap because I definitely don’t want to do that again, ever. ",1545034448.0

Pill print was IP204) by some dirty drug dealer. They didn't come in a blister pack or anything, they were given to me in a baggie. I had tried oxycodone 5mg pills before (2 pills, so a 10mg dose) and quite enjoyed my experience. Smooth, calm high, no nausea. I had the warm blanket feeling but no nodding.

I took 1 of these ""percs"" a few nights ago, and about 30 minutes in I noticed intense nausea. Also I could feel the high coming on very fast at this point. At around the hour mark the nausea became so intense that I had to dash to the bathroom to vomit. I didn't even make it in time, I projectile vomited before I reached the toilet bowl. I vomited twice all up, then when I went back to sit at my desk I had zero concentration and a bunch of brain fog, so I lied down.

I eventually fell asleep, but not before some of the most intense nods I've ever experienced. I'm talking mad, fully-blown lucid dreams here. Like nothing I've ever experienced before.

Now I’m not talking about calling because someone looks shady or over little petty shit like an argument, but, say, over something that endangers the safety and well-being of your family or children? 

Edit: I was kinda trying to avoid putting this out there since it’s still an upsetting topic, but I guess perspective is needed.

earlier this week my 21 year old mentally handicapped neighbor was in his front yard and watched my 12 year old daughter getting off the bus and followed her to our door while pulling his pants down and touching himself, she ran into the house and just said “there’s a man outside” so I go to the door and he’s *still there* and ***still*** masturbating. Knowing he’s handicapped I yelled at him to GTFO, locked the door and called the cops. He watched our house from his driveway the entire 45 min it took the cops to get there, then went inside when they got here.  anytime he saw us through the windows while we were waiting he’d come back up onto our porch. 

Of course I called the cops, I have a little girl to protect, but at the same time I don’t want to be responsible for someone else losing their child. Because of my occasional drug use I’ve seen what happens when the cops get called on a young black man, especially the handicapped who may not understand what’s going on. I’ve *seen* families get torn apart when someone gets locked up. 

What I meant when asking if being a user made you reluctant to call is; knowing what it’s like to **be** on the the wrong end of the handcuffs does it make you hesitant to inflict that on someone who’s genuinely a threat, but hasn’t physically caused harm yet? Are you more empathetic because of it?",1545011642.0

I have tried Endocet (E712) and Rhodes pharmaceuticals. I have to say that Rhodes Pharma is terrible with no euphoria at all and very little pain relief. However,  Endocets seem fine as pain reliever, but it doesnt give me euphoric feelings for some reasons. 

Before moving up to Percocet, I had taken 10 mg hydrocodone by qualitest pharma and they seems to be the best of all pharmas out there for 10 mg Hydrocodone (or should I say Norco) in terms of euphoric feelings and pain relief. Qualitest Pharma has yellow pill with V 3601 on them.

So I know that arteries carry blood away from the heart and veins carry it back towards the heart . I also know when you  do a shot and you hit an artery it hurts /burns like a mofo. But my question is that when you do a  shot and you do it in artery will you still get the full effect? Or is it lessened because it has to travel away from heart first and then back . Or does it never even come back to where it needs to go to get you high if you use artery? 

Hopefully that all makes sense. If not sorry and hopefully someone can explain it to me. I've been doing dope for a long time but I'm by no means a biologists. 

Im asking mostly cuz my beings are mostly shot and sometimes I can't hit and no know damn well I'm in an artery and push it in anyway but it seems to not hit me as hard. 

TL;DR..... If I shoot in artery will I still get as high or am I just wasting my shit . Thanks ",1544998343.0

THEY FOUND AND ARRESTED THE ORIGINAL NIGHT STALKER/GOLDEN STATE KILLER. 

That's crazy as fuck. Like 50 years have passed since he was active and how they found him is even crazier. They ran crime scene DNA through a bunch if databases and it popped. But it was his 4th cousin, so they literally (they, as in the feds) looked st this guys (the 4th cousins) family tree and recreated there entire lives times lines and looked for someone in the 4th cousins family who met the profile, AND THRY FUCKING DID. That's so crazy. Like he may be 72 and dying, but shit, he was one that even thr experts figured would never get caught. 


Oh and the same process is being used for the Zodiac Killer right now. 

If they figure out who the Zodiac was, I'll like literally shit myself. Since 1969 only one of his ciphers has ever been cracked. I'm willing to bet, especially with his level and nuance of ciphers, and the age he was when the killings began, probably a ww2 or Korea special forces vet. That's my two cents.  Only thing is, zodiac would be like 100 now, so hes definitely dead, but just to know the true identity of him would he very interesting.

I dosed 6mg bromazepam for some extra buzz. Hardly feeling anything from either morph or bromazepam. I have other meds to potentiate but the stigma of benzos and opiates scare me.

Long version:

I am prescribed 30mg morphine for my restless legs syndrome (codeine, gabapentin, pregabalin and clonazepam didn’t do the trick solely.)

So I usually take 3-6mg’s bromazepam as it is my favorite benzo and is pretty subtle combined with my morphine.

As of now I am feeling nothing from the added bromazepam. I wonder how this is possible since I rarely dose up to 6mg’s (which is a lot for my tolerance). I do have extra bromazepam to maybe potentiate it a bit more.

I also have other benzo’s with me (I always keep klonopin, prazepam, er alpro, nitrazepam) and gabapentins 600’s and pregabalins 25mg to potentiate aswell. My doc is quite aware of my changing painlevels daily, so he allowed me to take whatevers needed.

Would it be smart to just wait on the bromazepam to be fully kicked in or can I add a gab or pregab or another bromazepam to make a difference? Or would that be too cns depressing <> harmful?

I feel a bit stupid for these questions but Im just bummed out I am not feeling relaxed as I used to, especially since I am not a frequent/daily user of bromazepam.",1544984023.0

Oh, and it also erased most of my memory of that).

I've been hospitalized for 3 weeks for full thickness 2nd degree burns, and not once did I get IV opioids. Not when they changed my bandages (daily) and not even when they scraped dead skin off of my arm.

All I got (daily) was 2x10mg oxycontin ER and 2x10mg liquid oral oxycodone IR. For the first couple of weeks that was barely even enough for the background pain, let alone for the procedures. It was about a 10th of the dose I usually take to get high, so obviously it didn't get me high.

Now, 2+ months later, I'm no longer in pain but I still need to change bandages once a week. Possibly for 2 more months. After that I'm not to expose the burn site to sunlight for a year.

I don't know, maybe I'd have gotten better shit in the US, but considering the country I'm in never had an opioid epidemic and yes I *still* didn't get anything worthwhile, I doubt it.

Now the experience: I have insufflated 40mg of heroin with my friend, who insufflated 30mg. After around 10 minutes, I started to feel it. It was awesome, so much better than any other opioid, I have tried. Surprisingly I was not drowsy and felt pretty fresh. During the experience everything felt like a dream.

Although I just wish she knew how badly I didn’t do any of this to hurt her or my daughter. I tried keeping her in the loop with little hints here and there and when the times came, that she opened up (for instance today) let me talk I always shut down and was scared to.. why? I don’t know. She’s one of the nicest most honest people, I guess I just couldn’t bare the thought possibly loosing her over a mistake I got myself a little to deep into. She thinks I’ve been doing it for 3 years straight, which isn’t completely true, it started with a surgery, which was part of the beginning of the first two years it would come and go.. and when I mean come and go, I mean maybe a couple pills a few times a year, fun but nothin I cared much for or was deep into by any means.. she was pretty much fully aware of that. And it wasn’t serious so I see why we both didn’t think much of it. But then the last year has been hell, ended up getting way to many connections in the beginning of this year, people would trade me weed for pills which is cheap where I live.. that ended up coming to an end about 6 months once I realized it was messing my head up which in turn messes them up if I can’t be my normal self which I hate to ever do... anyhow, since about July I’ve been able to get stuff off and on consistently but never steadily.. so I guess you could say I got a buzz here and there.

I guess it was just like drinking a beer to me here and there so I didn’t understand the effect it had on everyone around me but it definitely did cuz that shit screwed up my mood. Not justifiable. Boredom and stress is your worse enemy and trigger. And unfortunately this year has been full of it. Always stayed safe, never got “fucked up”.. just an enjoyable buzz when it was appropriate to. Never around our daughter, just usually a night thing to end the day. Nothing above 15-20mg was my rule, which somehow I thought was fine in the moment. But anyhow, regardless it was screwed up to do. And now she thinks I’m some junkie, coincidentally around the same time I decided that the party is over. Which I guess I am to some sense, a “functional one” but the fact of the matter is this isn’t worth it. Im done for good. As well as I lost my connect so it’s even better to use that as another motivation to stop. I’m never going back, it’s not worth loosing your family over. I just want to be the father and husband they deserve and have been lacking for much to long now. Now is my time to make a change, and try to heal any open wounds.. I just hope she gives me this one last chance. I’ve put so much weight on her shoulders and I’m so sick of letting her down this past year, but I have a feeling with me deciding within myself I’m done for good it should help stabilize my brain and put it where it should be. I just hope she gives me that one last chance.. I don’t know what life is without them. If only she could understand how badly I’m going, wanting, and needing to try my honest to god hardest to make it up to them both. I will not let this stop Me, it just teaches me a good lesson and if I would of been fully honest I probably wouldn’t be here. Never let down your family guys, it isn’t worth it. Nothing is more important than your family if you ever get that opportunity to build one. Pleasure never over happiness. Happiness is more real. ",1544946593.0

I justs got home, and its 6 am. Should I go to sleep or wait through another day.

&#x200B;

I stayed home for a year... No partying, almost no drinks with friends, no nothing.. I decided to go out on Thursday and I hooked up with a girl that I liked for a long time. We hooked up before, but we were in a gray cone for 8 years.. She had a boy, she didn't know what she wants, yada yada yada.. You know the dea..l. I was really happy because of that, so I went out the next day again.

&#x200B;

I hooked up with another girl but it was nothing serious, just making out with her and getting lit. I did meet a lot of new people and old friends at the parties, and with them, a chance for more profit.  However I earned enough money to support these parties, but all this cash could payback consignment on the herb.

&#x200B;

I have also been taking Xanax since Thursday. First day 6-8mg in a day, on Friday I ingested 4mg and today; I only took 2mg. I have got clean from Xanax addiction at the end of this summer by tapering for a year with clonazepam. I will never make a mistake of using benzos for more than 3 days in a row

It's now 6.19 am and could probably be well over 6.30 am when I will finish this and edit all the mistakes, phrases and add something I probably forgot. Should I get some sleep or stay awake? If I go to sleep, I'll sleep through half the day, I'm feeling fine. I still have some amphetamines, but sadly no coke, nor can I afford to buy it if I want to realize my plans.

&#x200B;

I am also actually on methadone, but I have given her a bottle to my friend on Thursday because she was sick. We bought a gram and split it and I lost that as wel.. I'm loaded up with enough dope now. I'll stay away from benzos but I want to stay awake and be productive..

Fast forward to today, I am sniffing (never shot, thanks needle phobia) any and all the dope I can possibly get my hands on. Yesterday, I sniffed an entire bundle in 20-30 min and didn't feel anything. I copped a second bundle that evening, didn't even BOTHER doing the whole thing because I know I wouldn't feel it! My tolerance is obviously insane, and I desperately need and WANT to quit, I think. Or, I wish the fucking drugs still got me high! I'm deathly afraid of needles and couldn't shoot myself up if I tried, and have no one to do it for me unless I were to ask someone on the street and do it huddled in a freezing alley, which I will STILL take a hard pass on. Anyways, I have been trying to quit now for some time, but always wind up going and scoring drugs and (trying) to get high, anyways. I live 10-15 min away from the hood in a large city where something is always available, 24/7. Needless to say, suboxone is also readily for sale in the area. I am not trying to delay my withdrawal by getting addicted to subs and then having to kick the medication eventually. My sis has been on methadone and tapering for years, good luck to her. I don't want to be a slave to a maintenance med, it's just my opinion, but I truly am beginning to feel like I may not be able to quit without one, or AT LEAST serious medical assistance during the week long detox. I'm just kind of blabbering, but can anyone offer any advice? Should I just.. I dunno, have someone lock me up in my apartment for a few days so I fucking have to kick, or is it even possible to ease W/Ds with suboxone for a few days or few weeks, then discontinue it relatively painlessly? I have never taken Suboxone before. Fuck, man, this just sucks.

I have been prescribed with 90 10mg percs 3 times a day for a month for two months now.

I have a question about urine/drug test:

Do they only detect what kind of opiates I have in the system or will they also tell how much percs I have been taking in the system or both? Will they know if I have been taking more or less than what has presrcibed for me each day? for example, i take 6 percs a day then take only one perc next day instead of taking 3 times a day as prescribed. Will urine test tell that?

​

Also, i have been using white grapefruit juice and cimetidine (tagamet) for opiate potentiator, it really works. Will those show up on urine test?

Part 2: 

The next day I spend the morning eating bagels and walking around. New York is an amazing city by any standard but it was a little boring being by myself. I got more excited around noon when Ted texted me back telling me he could meet around 4pm. Our meeting spot was in the projects--which is something I have virtually no real-world experience. It was still early in the day and hours away from our planned meet up but I decided to head over to Brooklyn and explore a bit beforehand.

On the subway over the bridge, I met a homeless man who went by Franky D. I gave him a couple cigarettes and we shared a smoke after we got off the train. I told him about the area I was headed to and he gave me a strange look. I asked him about it and all he said was,  “You’ll probably stand out a bit.” I’m a white male in my late 20’s and I was wearing chucks, jeans, and a black Northface fleece (ya’ll know I love my Northface jackets). Franky advised me just to get in and out and not hang around. Point taken. Thanks Franky.

After that, I just got some coffee and walked around, waiting for 4pm. It struck me how much the place looked like 50 cent’s movie, “Get Rich or Die Trying.” I’m no stranger to sketchy neighborhoods, but I’d be lying if I didn’t say I was a little nervous to be in such a foreign place. A place where I didn’t know a thing about any of the cultural nuances that proliferate the drug game. I figure my best bet was just to stick to the basics: Always be moving, not too quick not too slow, mind your own business, be alert of my surroundings but also keep your head down. Don’t stare, but don’t necessarily not look either. Blend in. Have a ready-to-go excuse in case I was asked by a cop what I was doing, and so on. Basics in dealing with a sketch environment. I knew my Bachelor’s Degree in Drug Game Dynamics would come in handy eventually.

Finally the text came: “we good bro. come at it.” I was at a coffee shop about a 10 minute walk from where the meetup was. So I tossed my branded coffee cup (not trying to walk through the projects with a Starbucks coffee cup) and headed out. On my walk there the neighborhood slowly deteriorated as I went, like a fucked up timelapse, getting sketchier by the block. 

When I was about a football field away from the building, I texted Ted and let him know I was there. He responded quickly and let me know he’s running a few minutes late and told me just to hang in the area. Ok, not a good thing but I can deal. I wasn’t dumb enough to just take a seat next to the projects while I waited for my drug dealer, so I kept walking past the building. 

When I crossed the next street, into the next block, it was as if I had stepped into a different world. The sidewalk and streets were bustling. Everyone, and I mean everyone, was wearing black and white, lot’s of tophats and wallet chains. They were those old school orthodox jewish people with the little curlies on the side of their head. I have since learned that I had stepped into a hasidic neighborhood. And it was pretty much a surreal experience. First off, it was like I was invisible. There were people everywhere but nobody would even look at me. This was fine and all, but I couldn’t help but worry about the fact that I stood out like a sore thumb. I finally knew what the homeless man, Franky, was talking about.

The men had their garb, the women had theirs, and the kids had their own little uniforms as well. Each gender had their specific haircuts and there was really no discernable deviation in personal style. It really felt like I was walking around in a cult, and it definitely threw me off. I really didn’t have an idea how to carry myself around the projects, and even less of how to do so in a goddamn hasidic jewish neighborhood.

It was such a weird experience walking around that place. I quickly gave up looking for a coffee shop to wait in because every storefront was written in hebrew and I had no idea if I was even allowed to go in. I just imagined sweaty, angry, jewish men shooing me out speaking in tongues.

So I just kept walking the same circle of blocks and waited for Ted. 

After about an hour of that I finally got the text. “come now, I’m good. text me when u here.” Hell yeah, I thought to myself, *let's get the fuck out of here.*

When I got to the corner, adjacent to the building, I texted Ted to let him know. He responded with a call. And I answered.

“Yo man, you here now? Where you at?”

“What up dude, yeah Im here Im just across the street.”

“Ok what you wearing homie?”

“Ummm, im wearing a black sweatshirt, sunglasses, and a black hat.”

At that point, I was like *Fuck, I’m retarded, I look like a cop. Oh well.*

“Aight I think I see you, wave ya hand”

“I’m in front of the liquor store,” I said as I waved my hand.

“Aight I see you… you uh… you sure you not a cop or nothin?”

“Nah man, not a cop.”

“Aight then, go around the building on the left side and walk in the back door, I got it propped open with a rock.”

*Jesus Christ,* I thought, *I’m about to get fucking jumped.*

“Umm ok… wait, where are you dude?”

“I’m up in the building, I’m watching you from my window.”

“Uhh, alright.”

“Ay so just call me when you get in.”

“K sounds good, later”

I did the junkie math in my head, and I figured I had a 1 in 4 chance of this being a set up. But, I’m a pretty strong guy, a little bit above average in size and height, and he knows I only got $100 bucks on me. Even though it would be a perfect situation for setting me up, I figured it wasn’t worth it for him.

If it wasn’t already obvious, I was the only white person on this block. I surely I stuck out and it made me uncomfortable. The buildings were laid out in groups of four, each forming somewhat of a square, with a small courtyard in between. Everything was old, ugly, and decrepit. Trash and graffiti all around. It took me a couple of minutes of walking around like an idiot to find the door he was talking about. It was propped open with a rock just like he said.

As I stood outside the metal door, I took a deep breath. By that point my hands were shaking and I felt like I was about to have a panic attack, but I did my best to hide it all. But on the outside I was calm and cool. I’ve gotten pretty good at faking that look. I entered the building.

It was a small entrance area, with dirty tiled floors and white walls stained with age. It smelled like a government building, I don’t know what that smells like, but that’s what came to mind, whatever that’s worth. Directly in front of me was a dimly lit hallway, but I couldn’t see where it led. The interior was lit by long tubes of buzzing fluorescent lighting, some of which were flickering on and off as if I had just stepped into a horror movie. On my right were little lockers that looked like mail boxes possibly. And on my left was a clunky metal elevator that looked like it hadn’t been updated since the 80’s. I was standing there on my own, and for how large the building was, and how many people likely lived there, I was surprised to see that I was the only one down there. I got out my phone and called Ted. 

While it was ringing, an older women walked in the same door I had come in. She began to mess with the mailboxes on the right. Ted answered.

“Yo you in there?”

“Yeah”

“Alright, look down to your left, there is a little metal box near the floor.”

“Ya, ok” 

I saw what he was talking about, it was a small metal electrical box close to the ground with it’s door slightly ajar. I looked over at the woman, then back at the box. I peeked in it.

*Holy Shit!* There it was, a small bundle of bags wrapped with a little black rubber band. The old woman then came over to me and pressed the button for the elevator. The look she gave me said, *“What the fuck are you doing here white boy?”* I gave her a look back that said, *“We both know what I'm here for, mind your business.”*

Ted cut back in, “Yo dog you see it or what?!”

“Ummm yeah, yeah I see...it.”

“Alright well grab it and leave the money in the same spot.”

*Damn*, I thought to myself, *this dude is very trusting. Either that or there is nothing in the little baggies. Junkie math says it’s 50-50 on that one.*

“Yeah aight… ummm just hold on a second… I got to wait a second.”

“Bruh just grab and go, you needa get the fuck outta there.”

“Hold on I can’t hear you. You’re breaking up,” I lied.

Finally, after what felt like an hour, the elevator came and the woman stepped on. She gave me one last lingering look as the doors closed. The second she was gone, I grabbed the stash, left my money, and bounced out of there as fast as I possibly could. I know I could’ve just grabbed it and ran, but I didn’t think it was smart to test the kind of person this guy was. For all I knew, he would have chased me down or had someone waiting outside if I tried that. Anyway, I didn’t give a shit at that point if he was scamming me, I just wanted to get the fuck out of that place.

As I’m jamming down the sidewalk, through the wave of jews parting before me, I texted Ted telling him we were good and that the money was there. He replied quickly with “got it.”

For all the variables there were to contend with, the deal actually went surprisingly smooth. The bundle of baggies in my pocket felt like it weighed 10 lbs. and I was brimming with excitement to find the nearest bathroom to try it out. It ended up being a much longer walk than I wanted because I had to get through the hasidic neighborhood, but I eventually found a normal coffee spot close enough.

I order a coffee and then headed straight for the bathroom. The sign on the door said “Out of Service,” but I walked in anyway, it wasn’t my intention to use the toilet anyway. I couldn’t help but smile.

Turns out, Ted was a man of his word. Each of the baggies was imprinted with a stripper swinging around a pole and the letters “XXX.” Each had what looked like a point of off-white colored ECP, almost a greyish color. I didn’t have any needles, so I racked up a small line (to test) and went to town.

It will suffice to say that the rest of that day was enjoyable, aside from a brief stint of nausea. I walked around a bit more and got some pizza. The claims are true. NY pizza is fucking delicious. I took an uber pool on my way back into the city instead of the subway and immediately nodded off. The polite girl next to me had to wake me up at one point because I was leaning on her shoulder. I think I was annoying her.

Now that my druggie desires had been met, later that night, my mind went to the next best thing. I messaged one of my Tinder matches, her name was Amy, and she responded fairly quickly. This was a good sign. 

Amy worked at a restaurant on the west side and was about to get off work. She was down to meet up at the bar across the street. I told her I would head there in 30 minutes. I did a few more lines in the bathroom, got dressed, called for an uber, and headed out.

I enter the bar and walk past a guy and girl on my right talking closely, then continued on to the main part of the bar. I look around and can’t seem to find her anywhere. Finally, almost as I am about to leave, the girl I passed on my right flags me down.

“Oh hey! Are you Lucas?”

“Yeah that’s me. You’re Amy?”

“Yeah! Hi!” She said as she went in for an awkward side hug. The guy to her left is still facing away from me toward the bar.

I motion towards the guy with my hand, “Do you...uhh… want me to leave?” I said, slightly thrown off and confused by the situation.

“Oh no, no, this is Mike, I just met him!” At that point the guy turns around and shakes my hand, clearly annoyed that I was interrupting their little one-on-one.

“He is here on a construction job, from Philadelphia.”

“Oh,” I say, “...cool.”

“Sit with us and have a drink!”

So there I am, awkwardly trying to have a date with a girl I just met while there’s also another guy hitting on her on her left side, also trying to have a date with this chick. *This is weird,* I think. 

But, she’s pretty hot and actually looked like her pictures, so I decide to wait it out and see if the guy will eventually take the hint and leave. Mike goes on to talk shit about Tinder, Bumble, and online dating in general. Saying how it’s only for pussies and a real man would meet a women in person first, that a real man wouldn’t need an app for that. *Right on Mike, thanks for your ground-breaking insight*.

Amy herself seemed pretty cool. She had long brown hair, a cute face, and a small yet curvy body. Right away I noticed that she has cut marks all up and down her forearms. Sure, a definite red flag. But who was I to make that judgement? They were not anymore a red flag than the scars on my own forearms (track marks).

After an hour or two, everybody is getting pretty tipsy and Mike has still not left. It appears this guy has doubled down and is in it for the long run. Oh well, I got my drugs and a sweet hotel, my night will be fun regardless. I tell Amy I’m going to go outside to have a smoke. I was likely to just walk away after my smoke and call it a night. Mike says something smart about smokers as I walk away.

It was damn chilly outside. I was perched up against the brick wall taking puffs from my cig when Amy comes outside in a rush.

“Hey! Mike went to the bathroom. I think we should go now.”

“Huh? I thought Mike was your friend or whatever?”

“Not really, he just started talking to me and I don't feel comfortable telling him to leave. I want to hang out with you,” she tells me as she leans in for a kiss. 

“Alright, I say, stay here, I’ll go close us out at the bar.”

So, I go inside to close out and as I’m signing the check Mike comes back to the bar.

“Ay, where’d the piece go?”

“I don’t know, she’s probably in the bathroom.”

“Oh right. You want a shot of tequila?”

“No,” I said as I turned and walked out of the bar.

She was outside looking scared and I told her to hustle away with me because Mike will soon find out about our little ruse. So, we were jogging along the sidewalk away from that place, laughing, and joking about what a D bag Mike was.

We were both feeling each other pretty good at that point in the night and we were deciding what to do next. She recommended that she comes back to my hotel with me. I tell her that’s not possible because my Dad is there. We can’t go back to her place either because her kids are asleep or something. I let her know I’m down to pay for a hotel, and she agrees that that’s a good idea.

It was about 1am by then but we still had no problem finding a hotel with vacancy. I paid more than I would’ve liked to for the room but I was fine with that, my dick was basically throbbing out of my pants, I was horny as hell. 

We bought some snacks and drinks at the front and got up to our room around 1:30am. We chat a bit and have a few drinks. I’m slowly starting to realize this woman is a little… off. She keeps asking me strange questions like, when are you coming back to NY to see me again? And, what girls I’m talking to at the moment. Keep in mind, I had known her for about 3 or 4 hours at that point. 

Of course, I ignore the warning flags and we have sex. It was really, really good sex. I know I’m not supposed to stick my dick in crazy, but if you haven’t figured it out yet I have no self-control regarding my hedonistic tendencies. She was down to take control and do whatever. We had a good time.

A little bit after sex, were are just sitting there hitting her little vape thing, and I decide I feel like doing a few lines. So, I think of some plan to do it without her knowing. I was planning on telling her that I’m going to hop in the shower or something, and then bust out the lines in the bathroom. But then I was just thinking to myself like, *fuck that. I paid for this room, I don’t even know this girl or care what she thinks, I’m never going to see her again after tonight anyway.* So I just whip out the baggies right there on the desk, and chop up a couple lines.

“Hey I’m gonna do some drugs now I hope you don't mind.”

“Ohh nice, can I have some?”

I paused, a little surprised, “This...uh… this is not coke.”

She looks at me from the bed, clearly confused.

“It’s heroin.”

Holy fucking shit. The her reaction was definitely not what I was expecting. She immediately starts bawling her eyes out. Going apeshit in the hotel room, running around the place trying to find all her belongings. She’s crying hysterically, yelling out: “I am just not down for that! Oh my god! I am not down for that! I have to leave, I have to leave!”

At this point I’m sort of frozen by shock of her freak out, *what the fuck should I do?*

*Jesus Christ, ok well, that didn’t go as planned.* By then, she’s getting a personal and is telling me what a terrible person I am. I’m a worthless drug addict and whatnot. She continues freaking out for a few minutes as she gathers up her things. After her tantrum she bolts out the door holding her shoes and her eyeliner running down her face. It was around 3 or 4 AM by then.

*Well, that was unpleasant*, I thought, *but in the end solves more problems than it creates, I suppose.* Now I don’t have to sleep next to her all night and listen to her go on about all this weird shit. I blew threw a few more lines as I sat there naked in the desk chair until I nodded off softly. I came to when I hear a loud knock at the door.

It was Amy, of course. She was standing out there trying to get some words out, and apparently after I opened the door, I said “What!?” a little too sharply (I think?). So, she just says “Fine,” and frustratedly trotts away down the hallway.

I happily got back to doing my thing at the desk and enjoy a nice nod. About an hour later I hear another knock at the door, this time even louder than the first. 

*Oh my fucking god, is this bitch serious? Just leave me alone Jesus Christ!*

I walk up to the door butt ass naked and throw it open. “WHAT DO YOU WANT?!”  My heart stops. 

It’s four NYPD policemen and a paramedic standing in the hallway.

“Oh,” I say. 

The officer closest to the door speaks first. “Hi there, we’ve heard reports that the was some drug use going on in this hotel room and that there may be someone overdosing. Can you let us know what is going on?”

I blink a few times, trying to think of something to say to buy some time. But, at a loss for words, they come out in a jumble, “I uhh.. I...no.. what? No drug use.”

“Sir, a very distraught, concerned woman called us and told us what is going on.”

“Amy?”

“I’m not aware of her name sir. But you should know that we are not here to get you into any trouble, we just want to make sure everyone is ok.”

“Um ok, well yeah, everyone is ok. Wait, there’s no one else. I’m everyone. It’s just me. I’m fine.”

“So then you probably wouldn’t mind if we came in a took a quick look around?”

“I’d rather not let you in. I’m just sleeping here. In my own hotel room. That I paid for. Minding my own business.”

The officer next to him chirped in, “That does make me a little suspicious that you won’t let us in, if everything is as fine as you say it is. Can you explain why you don’t want us to come in?”

“Because I respect my rights.”

That seemed to be the answer he wasn’t looking for because he kind of just shrugged, nodded his head, and stepped back.

The closest officer to me piped back up, “Alright listen man, will you just let the paramedic check your vitals? Again, we aren’t here to get you into any trouble, we just want to make sure everyone is ok.”

I rolled my eyes, “Once again, it’s just me in here. And if you want to check my vitals, go ahead and check my vitals, but this is clearly just that crazy chick trying to get back at me for not wanting her to sleep over. If anything you should be going after her for misuse of emergency services. Now, will you let me put some pants on, please?”

“Uh, yes. Quickly.” The officer responded.

I nodded, and shut the door. I bolt to the desk, wipe off the residue, unroll the dollar bill, and grab the baggies. I’m freaking out, my mind is racing as I run around my hotel room naked looking for a place to hide the drugs. I throw on my sweatpants. I don’t know how much time passed, I noticed I was sweating. It was a ridiculously surreal moment, I felt like I was in a dream, the adrenaline was overwhelming me. As I was desperately trying to shove the baggies into the air conditioner vent I hear a “click” and the handle of the door begin to turn. *What the fuck,* they were coming in.

I couldn’t get the baggies to fit in the air conditioner vent, so with nowhere else to put it, I threw them in my pocket and ran to the door as they opened it.

“Hiya, ya sorry I couldn’t find my pants but got them now.”

“Sir can you sit on the chair while we take your vitals please?”

As I sat down I slyly wiped off the rest of the residue that I had missed before. They took my vitals and everything was good. They kept pressuring me to admit I was using drugs. While one of the cops and the paramedic were focused on me, the others attempted to casually look around the room. They saw nothing but some clothes strewn about and some empty beer cans on the nightstand.

After I sufficiently persuaded the paramedic that I was not, in fact, dying, they gave me a few words of caution and finally agreed to leave. They left the room and I locked the door behind them, this time with the manual lock as well. The baggies were burning a hole in my pocket by then.

I was still in a state of shock, I couldn't believe that I had just gotten away with that without being arrested. Surely this was some trick by the cops to let my guard down, and any minute they would bust through the door to put me in cuffs and haul me off.

All at once I poured out the remaining dope and did the entirety in a few lines.

*Yes, yes, let’s get rid of the evidence, for good.*

Now high as fuck, I nodded off. When I awoke light was creeping in through the blinds. Holy shit, I’m not in jail, I thought to myself, surprised.

I immediately pulled up my phone and checked my Tinder account. Sure enough, Amy had already blocked me and her profile was nowhere to be found. Whatever, I wanted nothing more to do with this chick. If she believes me to be in jail right now, all the better.

I collected my things and headed back to my hotel. When I got back, my Dad was still asleep, it was early and he would be getting up soon. Right when I got into bed his alarm went off. He got ready, showered, and headed out without saying a word to me, presumably because he thought I was asleep.

*Fuck’s sake, I need to get out of New York.* Yesterday was a day to remember, what a crazy series of events. I don’t know how I got out of it. I consider myself very lucky. I always amazes me how, regardless of clean time, every time I get back to drugs the problems come back like I had never let off.

The 5 hour flight back was pretty miserable but nothing I couldn’t handle. I was withdrawing from the copious amount of heroin I’d done, even though it was for such a short amount of time. The whole ordeal of the previous day set me back on a straight line. I do miss that lifestyle every now and then, as sober life can be boring at times, but that trip was enough to replenish the reserves for a while, I hope.",1544914590.0

Anyway, I show up and take a seat in the passenger side....she gets in and says she wants to test it on the highway as well as some backroads. Fair enough. 

Long and short of it- this bitch literally dropped herself off at her “work”. And said she was really interested in the car and would contact me later. The reason I said “work” in quotes is because started walking into a hoodish residential area after she got out of the car. P sure she was gonna go buy dope.  


Never heard from her again about buying the car. P sure this bitch was just desperate to get well. I wasn’t even mad.

Also, I’m trying to not ramble or make this too long, so I’m giving what I think are important details. If you need more info, ask and I’ll let you know anything.

A little background: I’ve been doing pills (typically oxy 30s) daily for years. My tolerance is ridiculous. Back around the end of June, I made a new friend at work. She does dope. It’s cheaper, easy to get... I made the jump and have now been doing h daily. She and I are like partners in crime- we always make sure we each have some. We have picked up for each other. We have introduced each other to our dealers. We have also become friends- good friends (hang out a lot, our kids play, etc). Her son’s dad died (od on fent he thought was dope) back in early July. We vowed to help each other quit for the new year. There have been many times that we meet up and when it’s time to make a run, I’ll actually go grab the dope while she goes and grabs cigs, food, etc. I know she is always extra nervous. She was arrested last feb with her son’s dad. He took all the blame for everything in the car (even what was hers). Her charges were dropped to disorderly conduct. She had 90 days probation, but she is terrified of getting in trouble again. I’ve never been caught for anything (knock on wood).

Ok, so on thanksgiving eve, everyone we knew was dry. We were hurting and not together (I was at work). She was able to grab a little. She said it was shitty and she only grabbed a small bit. We were still looking for some. A friend of a friend of hers was going to sell her a bundle for $90 ( we usually pay $70). She called and asked my opinion. We were going to split it, but she was putting the $ up and I’d meet her later to grab and give her $45. She was sold garbage I honestly don’t even know what it was, but it wasn’t drugs. She freaked out. I told her I’d still give her the $45. Over the next day or 2 she made things sound like she was already good (remember she had picked up the little bit) and that she had only been grabbing the rest for me. I know she is hurting for $ (newly single mom, etc.), and although I’m not much better off I give her the full $90. She has countless times given me some when I had none, so it’s not like she typically would screw me. I wasn’t happy about it, but I know she was in panic mode for $.

So yesterday, neither of us had much money, so we were going to split a bundle. She was going to grab it and I’d see her at work later to give her $ and get my half. I had no way to go do this as I share a car with my husband and he was using said car. Of course, she got popped. I feel awful. It could have easily been me (which she has pointed out more than once) had I been the one who ran yesterday. I’m being totally honest when I say I run for us more often and if I ever get popped , I wouldn’t expect anything from her- it’s the risks we take in this awful game we choose to play. However, she keeps crying about how much this will cost between fines/car impounded/whatever else. Am I wrong for not offering to pay some? Like, I’ll still give her the $35 I promised yesterday even though obviously the cops took it all. I honestly don’t have it to give and wouldn’t expect her to give me anything if the situation were reversed.",1544900874.0

He said those results make it look like I just took a pill before I came in and that's it. I take my meds 15mg twice daily as I am supposed to, no more or less for years now.

But I guess fucking not, i guess everyone can expect me to treat them and there things in a certain type of way, and i always FUCKING DO, but Noooooo, I cant even begin to think people will do the same for me.



Long story short,  i grow a personal amount of weed for myself. I have an almost professional level setup which cost me just under 2200. 3x3x6 tent, optic 6 LED grow light, well built inline duct fans, basically the works. I have been working a shitload and normally when I leave the lights havent come on yet, and I had been asking my wife to check her (the plant) and report to me on days I might not get a chance to. She kept saying ""looks alright to me""..... well now I know what ""looks alright to her"" is a goddamn almost dead plant. So right away I begin trying to explain to her what needs to be done, and that she needs to do it asap,  or there goes my grow. So after saying that she does not understand at all, I just say that it fucking whatever and I'll take care of it as soon as I get home in like 3 hours (I realize that saying a transplant and shit needed to be done ASAP was a little bit of hyperbole but it did need to get done, but not now), but if she could pull out everything I was asking so I could just get to work when I got home. 


That's where the trouble begins and is still going on. The bag of soil amendments which I literally needed,  is gone. It's been sitting in the same fucking place for like a month, waiting for the right time, and it's just gone. And that's the thing, that's the thing that has me FUCKING FUMING. While I may make a decent little bit, my family and I are still barely making it because of decisions my fucking mother made, which basically made it so if me and my wife want our own place again, my mom will be homeless,  nice right? And I have a somewhat costly opiate addiction to boot, which is my own problem and kine alone. So now, because I cant get these amendments without waiting several days,  and my plant is already bad enough, I'm going to lose my fucking plant, which this was my last seed, because I dont sell any for any amount of profit,  I only sell enough to start my next grow and that's it, maybe like a oz every time to someone I know, literally just to get my soil, seeds, and amendments, to begin each time with, and because of my financial situation, I cant replace the fucking amendments, and like it's really more like replacing the amendments, seeds, and possible nutrients I need, which all relied on that stupid fucking 25 dollar bag of amendments I already had.



I'm sorry for the rant, I've had a long ass week, I hate this fucking season, and now its like the one thing I cared about, besides my family, and is literally the one thing I have asked them not to mess with, unless I ask them to do something, or I want to show them something, is now IMO ruined, or atleast not usable until I have money to replace a bunch of shit, which unleas I'm willing to get sick for a day or two, I cant do for the foreseeable future.

I've delt with my friend being murdered in my own home because some dudes were trying to rob me, jail time, sorrows ect..

Story time

Fast forward a few years. I get out of jail October after serving around a year for a petty felony. I get out, no where to go. Mom gives me the ole ""One last time yo get your shit together."" stipulations of moving home to a particular sunny state in the south I have to 

1. No drugs 
2. Go to the suboxone clinic
3. Start Hep C treatment.

I move after being released after ripping and running for about a week. I get home to this sunny state where micky mouse lives and things are going well. Get a decent job at UPS, sub clinic, yada yada. I do what I was obliged to do.

4th week in the clinic I get upped to 8s and have a hankering for some boy. I meet this dude who said this guy will trade me a few packs for a few subs. Cool drive about an hour and a half to do the deal. I tell the guy, hey I need my wrappers because I have to bring them in each visit. Oh yeah its cool dude said he'll hold onto them and give you a free pack when we come back to get them... Mmmm okay I guess. 

Fast forward about 3 days, get a phone call from my clinic. ""Hey we need to do a count and a random UA."".... Uh fuck! So I stall it off until Friday when I get paid again and can go back to where I sold em and get my wrappers. 

Friday comes, I'm swettin it. Praying my wrappers will be there. Make an excuse at work why I have to leave yada yada, not before copping 2 dilaudid 8s first. My favorite drug and haven't done one since I got out. Get two 8s for like 60 bucks. Go pick up the middle man and head to town to get my wrappers. 

We get there and of fucking course the guy with them isn't home... We finally get a hold of him and he's all omg I just had them I can't find em... Mother fucker. So I grab .2 of some boy to heal my woes and go to the gas station to get a shot in. My middle mans girl calls some dude she knows. 

""Hey he's got some!"" yes! Sweet sweet relief. We wait for ever to meet the dude while time is ticking down to make it to the clinic for my test and I'm supposed to go back to work to finish my delivery route. 

Dude meets us, he only has 2 wrappers... I needed 5 and 3 unopened one's. Dudes cool though and gives me some fire ice though and tells me good luck and if I get kicked out the clinic he'll help me with what ever I need. 

Feeling defeated we make our way back home. So then work calls me... Hey did you abandon your route? I explain how I go to the sub clinic and HAD to go in or I would lose my script. They were cool and said no worries we have someone finishing it up. Woohoo ill take that as a single W. So then I call my clinic to see when I had to be there. Come to find out my nurse had to leave early for the day and I can just come in Monday! Second WooHoo! More Ws! 

So now I'm on my way home and i have to pick up my kitten from the vets. End up having to pay like 30 bucks when it was supposed to be free... Ut owe, funds are running low and I'm supposed to pay my mom back 50$ and have enough money to make it back and forth to work all week plus cigs. 

Well mom gets suspicious I only have X amount of money left and wants to see my pay stub and jot down everything I spent money on today. I proceed to tell her oh no that's how much money I have after I pay you back. I'm sorry you misunderstood. Yeah she still wants to see my money and make a list and see my pay stub.... Back to the Ls.

I make up a fake list of stuff. Gas, cigs, food, the vet, lunch ect. And thank the Lord I was able to talk my neighbor into loaning me 70$ just to show my mom.

Everything goes off with out a hitch, mom buys it. All good in da hood..... Moral of the story is...

Jesus fucking Christ that was not worth it at ALL. Sure I did 2 dilaudid 8s, qt g of some boy and some ice today but holy fuck that stress and close calls was not worth it what so ever.  

Thanks for listening to my iced out rant, I just had to vent to some people who would understand. I think I'm just going to go back to taking my subs like I'm supposed to lol

Pain pills in paticular. But every day I got them they always felt fucking amazing. But I got away from them and now maybe use them every month or so (I’ve been using surprisingly responsibly I’m impressed.

So my quam is this. Before I get to feeling how I want to feel now I get nauseous way easier and don’t really feel all the great. Well no where near as great as they would make me feel. So do you guys think the more regularly you use opiates the better they feel and you stray away from the nausea and just kinda feeling meh? If that makes any sense to you guys. ",1544837647.0

Tonight, I randomly try it again on a long shot, and it's a Christmas Miracle. It's unlocked & I have just enough to buy one 40mg Opana.. Call my Dgirl. She's been blowing my phone up all week begging me to bring her my usual $300/day. She's an addict herself and her life (high) depends on me and other unfortunate opiate addicts purchasing her product. Even better she's randomly closer to my house than usual. As most opiate addicts - at 28 -she generally doesn't stray far from her parents house or her mooching boyfriends car.

I've been in misery for 3 days. Getting by on the sketchy rewashes of Opana Cottons and the few remaining dollars I had. 

I get home - resisting the urge to break the pill down in my car and snort it in the KFC Parking Lot... So I can bang it and get the the most from it. I break the pill in half with the totally false notion that I'm going to save the other half for the morning. Extract it, and finally register. Very clean register.. Tons of Blood flowing back into the reservoir..  I push off.. After 3 days of being on the cusp of full blown WDs & nonetheless feeling (typically - comfortably) awful.. And the feeling is fucking indescribable. Every single time.. is amazing. I literally melt into my PC Chair.  I feel like a Hershey Kiss with a blow torch 2 inches away.  

God Damn. This life is a lot of misery, but those 30 seconds almost make things worth it. Hopefully things will get better for us opiate addicts at some point here in the USA. Legalizing Opiates - So many lives would be saved, parents 401ks intact, so many highly intelligent young men and women who are dying to work would be shoveling the coals of capitalism into the economy - but for now we can just hope to look forward to that next $100.. that next clean register followed by that rush of euphoria - a godlike state that no cookie cutter normie could ever understand. 

Stay strong  friends. I hope the poppy is plentiful for you this Christmas Season. Enjoy it while you have it & if you're in a dark place and sickness is creeping in - just know it won't last forever. Sooner than you know it you'll see that blood fill the reservoir and be on your way to that fleeting cloud 9 where we wish to reside forever.

God Bless

Insufflation is essentially useless. Plugging has like double the bio of oral and injection is obviously top. 

However what I don't quite comprehend is when I plug morphine it doesn't seem any stronger then an oral dosage. It seems to just be equal to an oral dosage and sometimes even weaker. 

 I do go to the bathroom and defecate/clear myself out before plugging so it's not like I'm backed up or the drug is being absorbed by any wayward shit. Just found it strange. I have read before though that the oral bio ranges quite a bit so maybe I'm just a higher metabolizer then most? Still doesn't explain why I'm getting better effects swallowing it though then plugging since plugging should still be significantly stronger I would say. 

The pills are 100mg kadian slow release morphine. The ones that are encapsulated and have tons of extended release balls in them. I take 500mg a day.

I'm going to try and use my own resources along with u/nextdistro If she would help me to start up a free narcan awareness and giveaway, a long with fentanyl test kits and instructions on how to use them. I also want to get some kind of licensing for drug and abuse councillor, and offer free support to people who I can. It's been so dark for me since November 9th, 2017 when my Heather died, to think I would lose Cody, one of my dearest friends November 10th of this year, almost a year to the date of losing her is just, its just too much dammit. Enough is enough, if my town wants to just pretend this fentanyl epidemic doesn't exist, I won't bother with them, I'll just raise awareness and support myself.

I am kicking black and white so I am all over the scale of shitty. My first day kicking, I went to my girlfriends Christmas party for work. I don’t drink, even when I am using, so I just sat around watching everybody get hammered. When it was over and I though it was time to go home, all the drinks decided to take the party to another local bar. I didn’t feel like sitting by myself in a corner while kicking a habit, so I went home to our kids. When I got them in bed, that little voice inside my head told me that i should take the opportunity to go get high before I had to pick her up. I wrestled with the thought so hard that I went into a full fledged panic attack which turned into a manic episode. I ended up speeding to the bar and running in like a psychopath and hugging my girlfriend because I convinced myself that she died. I calmed down a bit and assured her I was ok and that I wanted her to stay and have fun. I went home and spent a couple hours talking to a wall. After I picked her up and got her in bed, I lost it even more. Around 3 am, I went outside for a cigarette and saw a man sneaking around my neighbors house. He had on an orange shirt and long gray hair pulled back in a pony tail. The only problem was that he was at least 11 feet tall. I turned on my flashlight on my phone and started to chase him. As soon as he got around a corner, he disappeared and I was left standing in my neighbors yard yelling “where the fuck are you hiding big boy?” I have been diagnosed with bi-polar two by a couple doctors but my manic episodes have never been severe. Maybe it was from detoxing, but this was the worst freak out I have ever had, even when on several drugs and awake for days. It was like I was witnessing all of it happen, but I couldn’t stop it. After my girlfriend got me inside, I fell asleep from 3 am on Thursday and woke up at 6:45 am today, like nothing happened. I feel like shit and I remember bits and pieces of my incident but I am glad it’s over. It’s been a rough 3 days, but Monday I enter an intensive out patient program. I finally admitted to my work that I am an addict, and not only did they not fire me, they asked how they can help. They are going to work my schedule around an outpatient program so I can finally get real help. I am 32 and I dropped acid for the first time at 12. After that it was on a cracking with whatever drugs I could find. I graduated high school and always have a had a job. I manage a water company now, but a 20 year drug career is good enough for me. My girlfriend of 13 years and our 2 kids deserve the best me possible. I need to make her my wife, and I need to show her the love and respect that I couldn’t show her while using. My kids need a dad that is not only there for them, but a dad that’s not high. Even if they can’t tell, I know I can be a better man. This sub has gotten me through some shit. I have had some laughs, I have come here when I felt like I was losing my mind and grip on reality, and there was always something to make me laugh, or something to make me not feel so alone.

I know this isn't an opiate question, but this sub has the best community and the most knowledge. I think that shooting heroin (dilaudid, oxymorph, etc.) is a point in a drug users life that generally means nothing is too 'hardcore' or 'crazy.' I'm not saying that all IV heroin users also bang coke and meth, but they've likely tried it (some hate all stims) or would be willing to try it if they have an appetite for uppers. 

So back to my question, I've been shooting crack for the past few weeks after mainly smoking it for a while. I had shot it before, but the prep work used to keep me away. Putting a rock in a pipe with a little chore is a very simple task compared to breaking it down with water plus vinegar, citric acid or whatever in a cooker. Yeah, I'm lazy because it's really not much work haha. 

So every time I fix up a shot, I'm left with a decent amount of residue around the cotton that obviously doesn't end up in that shot. It's much too thick to draw up, and kinda like a paste. It's great for doing another shot, but I'm wondering if that is a result of too little (or much) vinegar, too little water, not letting it sit long enough or something that I can't figure out. 

I've been trying to do a really fat shot, but this keeps preventing me from getting as much in the rig as I'd like. Any advice on getting it all into my rig, and avoiding the relatively good amount of byproduct? I'm using vinegar as my acid if that makes a difference. 

COMPLETELY RANDOM TANGENT: Any IV users sometimes wish they could show off their skills to people? Silly I know, but I used to think about how my IV skills could potentially come in handy one day. A zombie apocalypse or surviving the world getting nuked out of existence are my go-to scenarios. A co-worker gets seriously injured, and I'm able to hit her first try with the morphine that I [of course] stole from the pharmacy. I never end up doing all of the drugs myself (I would do it all for sure), and everyone keeps needing me to hit them with morphine constantly... I seriously thought about this for hours before hahaha. 

Hope everyone is having a great Friday and staying safe out there! This community is special and always helps me with the isolation that comes with drug addiction, so thanks to you all. ",1544819188.0

I do anywhere from 2-5 every other day or every few days. Sometimes I take a break for about a week and I've had a couple periods where I was clean for 3 months. Anyway last night I couldn't find any blues and I recently found out one of my hooks slangs tar too. So I decided to try it out last night. 

And holy shit what a difference. I love the consistency of blues and always knowing what I'm getting into. I smoke them so I know instantly if it's real which it is 99% of the time. But last night I smoked maybe $20 worth of the tar I bought and damn that shit knocked me on my ass. 

I live in california so we get that sticky black tar heroin. I lived in philly for 6 moths and was dabbling with that weirdo brown powder stuff they have and it was very weak I always felt like I was getting ripped off. 

But Jesus Christ that shit I just got is nuts. I gotta be careful not to overdo it at work today! Just thought id share this story of being reacquainted with tar as I've pretty much been up all night only sleeping for an hour here and there. I'm fuckin wired.

This has been a long and tiring time. So after making it there and back safely, but getting home to find out I had been sold packs of cut and not dope... I've finally gotten well, high even, so I'm gonna tell this story of karmic retribution. Hopefully you are entertained by my hypothetical situation... 

After 3 long days of working, being too busy and not having ride nor reason to go down to The Hood, sickness getting worse and worse, desperation started to sink in. I concocted a plan to steal my grandfather's car in the middle of the night to go cop. I knew it was a massive risk, I could lose my living situation and ruin the trust and relationships i had gained back with my family after years of drug use. I could lose my freedom as I don't have a license, and presumably I'd be driving with drugs in the car, possibly with paraphernalia and high on the way back.

The plan started out as basically a dopesick fantasy of let's somehow get the key and then take the car. Then I really started to consider it.... But how would I pull that off? well let's start by getting the key, and if I can actually do that, the rest will make sense. He's got a bunch of shit on his keychain so when he wasn't looking, I snatched just The car key, sliding it off of the key ring, figuring he wouldn't notice since there are so many other keys. It was a gamble, but it worked. He didn't notice. 

Now I had to think about how I was gonna slip out in His car without him noticing that its gone, along with myself. I thought about the situation. His car is almost silent when it's turned on, and the garage door is brand new, so it too is silent. You can't hear either one in the house, not even right next to The door. He's in the living room watching television, so he would see me go into the garage. I decided that I would leave when he was asleep later tonight. His room is on the other side of the house entirely so there's no way he would be able to hear me leaving in his car, especially if he wasn't awake. 

He finally goes to His room around midnight.. The second I heard snoring, I made my move. I opened the door to the garage slowly and quietly, and I walked out to the car. I can still hear snoring. I smile to myself and close the door to the house. I get in the car and slowly close the door, not wanting to make too much noise. It wasn't closed all the way but it was closed enough for now. I opened the garage with the garage door opener on the visor in the car and turned the key. This is it I'm 100% going! I'm getting well tonight after 3 long days of sickness. I couldn't be more excited.

I pull the car out of the garage and close the door again. I pull out of the subdivision into the main road, and I drive a few miles to the freeway. I hope on, then turn on some Christmas music and drive the half hour drive to the hood. I was the only car in the highway for most of the trip. I turned on the windshield wipers. They said it was supposed to show tonight, lucky for me that it's too warm and it's raining slightly instead.

I get to my exit and pull off, making a few turns before I get to the street I know so well. I had been coming here for years, first to the spot across the street, unprofessional place with no deals, always getting raided. One day they were out of dope and the girl I was hanging out with who lives there told me I could go across the street to the side door and it's another dope spot. 

That was about six and a half years ago and I've been going there ever since. This dope house was the safest dope house you could imagine. This guy ran it but was never there cause he had workers. They worked in shifts and it was 24/7/365. You just knock on the door. This door was barricaded just in case the cops tried to break it down... But that's as never gonna happen because of monthly payoffs to the local precincts narcotics division. This guy had this street on lock. 

Speaking of safe, this dboy pays people in dope to bring him as much narcan as they can. He sees this shit as a business and respects the customer, treating them well if they are big spenders and long time clients. Anyways, after walking in the barricaded door, you have stairs to your right and a door to the basement opposite, along with a hallway and series of rooms where the employees live. The stairs to the next floor take you up into another hallway with two doors, one into another employee room and the other into the hangout spots. Two rooms with tables and sterile water packs, bags of cotton from the exchange, and alcohol pads. There was a third room too, another employee room (this business employs about ten people, one of the only job opportunities in the area) but this employee sells new rigs. I

There was graffiti on the walls, so and so was here, rip, no begging, one day at a time, all kinds of addict shit. It was sorta dirty, slightly grimy, pure hood spot. It was heaven on earth. This time I just grabbed my shit and dipped, but normally I would run upstairs and sit at those tables, sometimes doing a small shot and leaving, other times doing a nice big shot and lighting a cigarette, relaxing and nodding for a few hours, sometimes talking shit with the other clientele. 

I hopped back on the highway,racing home to do a shot, but using cruise control to stay the speed limit, not wanting to risk getting pulled over and going to jail sick. I pulled off and I made it back safely. I snuck back into the house and ran to my room to fix up. Threw a pack in my spoon and mixed up. Pulled the solution into my rig and tied off, hitting my eager vein with ease after registering, seeing the red plume of blood slipping into the syringe. 3...2...1... And... Still dopesick? What's going on?

I shot all the rest of the packs... Nothing. After all that, I got sold cut?? I thought about karma for hours, wondering what the odds where that after pulling off such a maneuver it just so happened to be the one time my plug got ripped off..ever... Going through a fairly new connection for him, His junkie testing the bag was in on the scheme.. 

I couldn't believe it. What a nightmare. I tried to sleep, having to work in the morning, but also potentially having a ride to a nearby town I could take a bus to the hood from. I texted my plug to let him know what happened. He told me if I could get down there again that he would do something for me on him. 

I actually fell asleep somehow, but waking up a few hours later soaked in sweat after having a dope dream. I went to work, tortured by my brain and body screaming for dope, my actual chronic pain feeling ten times worse than normal. I make it through a grueling shift and get picked up, to be dropped off in the town next to the city. I quickly take a bus to the crossroads I cop at. 

I get back to the spot, feeling deja vu for some reason. The worker calls my plug and runs to grab reimbursement packs from the basement. I drag myself upstarts and finally get myself well. Feeling pins and needles along with hunger as my body normalizes. I light up a smoke and enjoy a nod, a nice surprise from doing just half a pack expecting only to get well. There seems to be no problem in the world for a few moments. I leave the trap and head home, finally well, big goofy smile on my face, wishing I would have just waited to begin with, but glad to not feel the pain for another few days...

I was prescribed 10/325 percocet several years ago and I had taken anywhere from 3-4 a day. 

I had a really terrible autoimmune arthritis just show up out of the blue and it was so bad I couldn't even get out of bed for nearly a year until they figured it out.  

Anyway, to the point.  I took these pills religiously for several years and the arthritis would come and go after I started taking a biologic.  I felt a lot of pain and misery even between the biologic but functional.

I decided that I did not want to take opiates anymore so I quit them a month ago.  I must say the entire process was not a pleasant affair, the first week forget it.   

Even at a month I have difficulty getting to sleep.  I am currently sleeping every other night and not when I want to.  I sit in bed 10 hours sometimes trying and can't.

That isn't why I am here asking though, just thought i would share that miserable part.  The real reason I am here is that the pain I experienced daily has vanished since I have stopped taking them.

I thought perhaps the pain was from joint damage before the biologic but nope, it's gone now.  All those years taking those things I think might have been caused from taking them.

Seems odd right?  Any thoughts?

I did once about 10 years ago on bluelight forums I think they were called and was told to “stop lying and inciting fear”. However, in the last decade it’s become far more prevalent and there’s been way more studies. 

So from in 2004 I was diagnosed with small cell liver cancer. I was prescribed OC 80s and Lortab 10/500 (Vicodin) for breakthrough pain. Dr. Would never increase my OC, but would give me all the lortab I wanted. Fast forward three years to 2007  and I was taking approximately 10-12 lortab a day which equals around 5-6000 mgs of Tylenol a day. It was about this time of year and I went to visit my parents in eastern wa. I started noticing really bad tinitis in my ears and when I stood up or when I walked my balance was all over the place. The closest thing I could describe it as was if felt like I was constantly under water. 

I was watching tv in my room at my parents and my dad comes in and said “do you realize your tv in here is louder than the tv in the living room?” We can’t hear our tv over yours. I had no idea. My husband said to me earlier that day that he’s had to repeat himself to me multiple times to get me to hear him. Huh, off to the emergency room. 

ER doc said oh ya must be and inner ear infection. Here’s some steroids and abx. Ok cool go him start meds. Next day I wake up and the best way I can describe what I heard was a balloon slowly letting out air.  Not so it squeaked, just a rushing of air. Then nothing. Back to ER, ok stronger abx more prednisone. It will slowly come back. I never heard another sound naturally. The Tylenol toxicity that was eventually diagnosed after getting to an otolaryngologist caused me to go from perfect hearing to nothing in less than 3 weeks. 

My kids were 8, 3, and 3.  Try getting your 3 year olds to understand mommy’s ears don’t work anymore. If you want to talk to her, you have to look at her so she can try and read your lips. My 8 year old had to grow up quick. She became the third parent. She felt like she couldn’t go out and play if my husband was at work for fear of one of the twins falling and hurting themselves and I wouldn’t hear. I was totally deaf for 10 months. Then I received a cochlear implant in my right ear. Which allows me to hear about 50% of normal in one ear. Music doesn’t exist for me anymore because my implant only allows me to hear about 23 different tones. So overlapping sounds are impossible and music in only 23 tones sounds horrible. It’s difficult for me to hear in restaurants, I tried to go to a comedy show, which didn’t work because people laughing made it so I couldn’t hear the comedian continue their bit. I have to make sure a movie theater offers CC before I can go to a movie, which is much better than a decade ago. 

I just beg you. If you’re ingesting a lot of Tylenol...stop. Don’t. It’s not worth it. I was 27 when I lost my hearing. I beat small cell liver cancer, thank God, one of the highest mortality rates of any cancer. So losing my hearing could be much worse, but it didn’t have to happen. If you are noticing tinnitus stop now. It’s not worth it. I know I’m repeating myself, but being deaf, losing one of my senses, is one of the hardest things I’ve ever had to deal with. I was depressed for a long time. Thank God for my family. Be safe everyone. ",1544773671.0

40

I ride the bus over to the old trap motel room.

But I get off a few blocks up from the stop that’s closest to it, so I can get something to eat at McDonald’s. When I get up to the counter a pretty girl takes my order which is for two sausage biscuits, a small orange juice and a cup of coffee. She puts a tray on the counter and my food and drinks on top of it. I ask for a few packets of grape jelly, because sausage biscuits with grape jelly are my favorite to eat for breakfast, and so I go sit at a table over in the corner and open the wrappers of the sandwiches and put jelly on them and then squirt the other packet onto the paper so I can dip the sausage biscuits right into some extra jelly. They really are my favorite thing to eat for breakfast. One time, when I was starving and homeless on the street, this guy woke me up with a five-dollar bill and gave me a few cigarettes. I’d been sleeping under the overhang of a strip mall in front of a nail salon. It was raining. Instead of using that money for another pack of cigarettes or waiting to get another few bucks to go in on a bag with someone so that I could get well, I walked directly to McDonald’s to buy and eat five sausage biscuits with grape jelly in a row. 

So, I’m sitting there scarfing my food the way I always do so that I can barely even breathe and choke on it once or twice between slurping at the orange juice. It’s still dark outside. Traffic is slow to move on Sunday mornings like this, but eventually it’ll take off. The sky has a few violet veins of what look to be promises of daylight running through the clouds, and across from me at another table a woman holds her cup of coffee in a pair of dirty skeleton hands. She wears a purple hoodie that’s in good condition, but a little dirty. I can tell she’s homeless and high. There’s that blissful crimp of her lips on her face and the pin pricked pupils that heroin gives people. For me it’s easy to see. It’s like an aura of warm glamour shot fuzz that she wears, and I can see. The lady is pretty, still in her early 40s I would guess with big eyes and no wrinkles but the obvious wear and tear of life on drugs and the streets. The fact that she’s high so early in the day means that she’s got something figured out. When I was on the streets, I was always sick in the morning and had to hit licks to come up for the day. But, then again, girls fair better than men in that regard out here. They have what is arguably the most sought-after commodity in the history of the world, but it’s not fun living like that however good the drugs feel. It all comes at a heavy price.  

After eating I make it up to the old trap motel room, number 127 at the Lindell Motor Lodge. It stinks as badly as it ever did, so I hear. I can’t tell, though. That’s just what the customers say. The gun I bought when I first started selling and living here lives under the bed. It just doesn’t feel necessary for me to be toting that thing around everywhere I go. I still want to have it. I just don’t want to have it with me, so I leave it here. Makes me feel better. Even if it doesn’t make sense.

Customers show up one by one. Peanut Boy comes by with Barbie. Eddie is in and out every morning, but I’m always giving him his daily amount to work out of and he gives me the cash for whatever I gave him the day before. Other bicycle and flashlight people come in for smaller amounts. I usually only sit there until 12 and let Eddie handle the business from his room after that, but in the five hours or whatever it is I usually sit there, I make anywhere between 700 to 1500 dollars. That’s every day and not counting the people who get quantity like Sharky or Cheese or even Martin from me after I’m done here. Sal shows up at nine or so and walks right in. I always meet him at Dee Dee’s place. Never here. 

“What’s up Junky Vonnegut?” The way he says it isn’t even the same.

“Sup, Sal?”

“Nothing man. Just came by looking for a little bit bigger piece than usual.” He usually only gets a couple grams at the most. 

“Yeah. I think I can do that for you. What were you with Sharky for last night?”

“Oh, man. You know. Just doing our thing, bro. We’ve been working hard out here. Got some bigger clients now. That’s why we got what we got last night and gotta get this issue right here.”

“I didn’t know you guys were that tight.”

So I recently found an old bottle of 5/325 hydros at my house, prescribed from earlier this year. I ended up never taking them and forgot about them. In the past I've enjoyed small doses of opiates here and there, mostly codeine and hydrocodone. I remember I used to take 20mg of hydro and I would have one hell of a nod. This time around I'm not getting any positive effects whatsoever. Just very spacey and nauseas. It almost feels as though I have a concussion.

Yesterday I grabbed two, split the pills in half and took them in the afternoon. An hour or so later I just felt tired and like I was gonna vomit. I shrugged it off as my first time doing any opiates in a couple years so I waited 8 hours, did a proper CWE (to be clear, I have lots of experience with CWE, so this is not the issue), and took 15mg worth, and had the same effect, only stronger. No euphoria, no warm feeling. Only nausea and, well, pain killing effects, although not pleasant at all. I tried smoking some low THC high CBD cannabis to relieve the nausea, only for it to perpetuate the gross feeling.

Earlier this afternoon I thought that I would try something right in the middle, and worried that it was a problem with my CWE, simply took two and a half pills (12.5mg hydro, 816mg APAP). I felt sedated, sure, but it was that same horrible feeling. Nausea, no warmth, heavy head, sedated, mild headache, etc. Everything you would associate with opiates if you took out all of the positive effects.

Anyone else experience this? You know, maybe this is a good thing. I've never been one to grow to habituate opiate use, but no one is immune to it's allure when things are working as expected with the drug. Even so, I would love to know if anyone else has felt anything similar to this.

Thanks in advance.

I chuckle and upvote the memes like ""when he says he's about to pull up, he's just leaving the house"" etc. cause I have had to deal with that on occasion with my plug and backup dealers, but for the most part my dealer rocks!

I've been going to him/her mostly daily for about 2.5 years now, let's call him Bub, but he got popped a year ago and now his girl runs it, so she goes by Miss Bub. They run a real professional, nice business with good deals and fast runners (I've only met the actual Bubs a few times). In the daily trips for 2.5 years, there's been maybe 3 days they weren't good and I had to use a backup, maybe 3 more when the phone was off for a few hours but came back on. She's consistently open from 7am-11pm (sometimes if I'm late I'll use a backup, which always makes me appreciate my plug more). I rarely wait more than 20min at the spot, usually 10, and often the runner is there waiting for me!!

Not only that, they've had consistently good shit this whole time, it's just honestly my favorite in this area, and because I'm such a good customer, I can ask for a front once, sometimes even TWICE a week, typically in the mornings cause they know I'm coming back later with money. (The front is usually just 2 dime bags but it gets me well till I can get more cash). No expectation to pay it back, and she's never said no to me. I'd say on average I ask for that once a week, but buy a good amount 6/7 times a week. If I do have to wait a while, they throw in extra typically.

I decided to make this post cause she just sent out a text with her ""Christmas specials"" lol and they're some damn good deals! I know I can get a great deal at 7am sharp tomorrow morning. It's just nice not having to deal with middles and shit plugs. I know cause some of my backups are just slow, greedy, unprofessional, and their shit is inconsistent.

My family doesn't remotely resemble anything that it was when she was still here. I use to love the holidays and each year since she has passed has gotten worse and only made me resent them more and more. I miss her so much, we were really close. She was the most awesome lady, no judgement ever only love! My home was always open to my friends, dinner was made every night and it was always enough for 10 people! Even as I got older, right before I moved out, she would still wait up in the living room usually fast asleep by the time I got home but I would always go check (my room was separate from the main house) and sure enough she was there just to make sure I got home safe and to ask me how my day was and remind me she loved me. My father is another topic, but let's just say he was probably the worst person who reacted in the most awful kind of way. He was not there for me or my sister, he kicked us out of the house in the pouring rain 2 days before Thanksgiving all bc I stood up to him in defense of my mom as he had some mental breakdown and verbally degraded his dying wife of 36 years who was to sick from chemo to do anything more than ball her eyes out from the horrible things coming out of his mouth. I don't care who you are, you will not speak to a woman, much less my mother, in that kind of way without me having something to say about it. He attacked me, placed his hands around my throat as to strangle me, only to have me remove his hands and hold him by the wrist just for him to try and pull back to I assume swing on me so we fell to the ground. He got up and called the cops saying I assaulted him (he's a cop btw) they could see he was clearly off his rocker but nevertheless we were given 2 hrs to pack our entire lives into my truck, trailer, sister car, fiance's car and be gone to the streets. Us 3 along with 11-3 week old English bulldogs (me and the fiance did breeding on the side). My family is gone now, I've since gone from a insane oxy/coke addiction of 10 years to now banging bth for the past 3..... She would be so heart broken to know where I'm at in life. My father ruined my finances as we were in business together (family owned construction company of 44 years) stole over 15k from me, tried to have me shut down with all material vendors as to cripple me from being able to work, shit talks me to no end, but he's still my dad and just bc I don't like him I will always love him. I just hate that I find myself wishing it was him gone and not her.... I feel awful to even type it and read it. I'm sorry for the vent post Fam. You guys after the only ones who understand pain and using to escape. I just want to do a issue and go to bed, waking up in a couple days so I can try to get past this broken heart that seems to only hurt more, never getting better with time. Take time each day to remind those around you how's much they mean to you, don't ever go to bed angry with your loved ones, no one is promised tomorrow. I hope you all have a better holiday season than I do. Happy and safe Nods Fam! ",1544762318.0

By being put in the oven or microwave maybe?,"I’ve been ripped off several times now in my area with product that looks just like our usual good ECP, but it ends up having no opiate effects... just seems to make me tired / slightly drowsy like benadryl usually does.

I know everything’s cut with Dormin usually in my area. A lot of my dealers are too lazy to remove the red specs. Of course there may be many other cuts but I know of this one being the most prominent.

This totally sounds like I’m trying to whip up some fake dope and rip people off. I’m actually not. I would probably just be honest about that here. Actually been on subs for a while, but I use every few weeks for a couple days.

I’ve had 2 dealers that often sell good product sell me this garbage. When confronted, the main dude I go to was super honest about it being bunk (he blamed his boy for giving him fake shit unknowingly) and ended up hooking me up the next time (with good shit).

I’m just curious how it’s possible that this shit looks identical to ECP. I know a tan powder isn’t crazy but it’s seriously eerily similar. 

Talked to an ex-dealer from the area that I’m cool with when it happened and she said that they probably used Dormin and baked it in the oven. 

Idk though... I feel like it wouldn’t have looked like that. 

Thinking about it... I’ve actually had a third dealer dealer do the same thing but rock it back up and everything. Completely bunk but looked so fire lol.

My friend got basically robbed of .60 of some bth last week from this dude I used to go thru, back in my using days. She paid him for a G and he only gave her .40 and yes, she gave him the $ 1st without checking the weight.

As you all can imagine he's been ghosting her and stringing her along saying he's gonna make it right, blah, blah, blah.

Well guess who just came thru for her bigtime???
Moi!
I texted him telling him I'd buy a G from him if he added the .60 he owes her to it so basically giving him $80 for 1.60.

I just met him and he gets in my car and says there's only 1.40 but I'll get you the rest, I promise! Yeah, right m, fuckface, total bs. I then proceeded to tell him to just weigh out .60 cuz I'm not buying shit from him and to hurry up and weigh it out cuz I'm fuming, pissed he did that to her! He gets super agro and pissed off and is screaming at me saying fuck you, don't ever call me again, blah, blah, blah.

I drove away with around .55 so I'm super happy and very , very proud if myself! Just to add to the story, I've been on MMT for a little over 3 years now and don't use nor have I used since starting on methadone. Nice thing is, is that I wasn't even tempted to do any of the bth, at all so I'm super proud of that little victory as well!

I dedicate this post to all of us who've been fucked over, robbed, stolen from, lied to, strung along, etc, etc over the years, it's the small little victories that count once in awhile, right?

*Edit*:  Spelling, Grammer and basic shitshow of a post. I'm such a stickler for all of that but I guess I was so damn excited about the whole ordeal I couldn't wait to tell y'all!

Not strictly opiate related, but I suppose I’ll be prescribing them so there’s the nexus to make it somewhat pertinent. 

The opportunity exists for me to take a medical student on a clinical placement in my practice. 

I’m somewhat ambivalent to the idea. On one hand, I’ll have someone who can talk to the patients, run out for coffees, is keen, uncorrupted & not yet jaded by life in general or the practice of medicine specifically. 

They’ll be in a couple of days a week & I’d be responsible for formulating a basic curriculum and providing some structure. 

Not simply a “sit there, shut up & watch what I do” thing. 

In some ways it’s a terrific opportunity to be involved in educating and arming the next generation of idealistic young doctors and preparing them to go forth into the world in their chosen profession. 

I do feel somewhat obligated because I’m just a link in the chain so to speak & feel a responsibility to pass on what I’ve learned & to mentor an unspoiled youngblood.

Plus I was in their shoes once and someone mentored & put up with my youthful exuberance & stupid, inane interrogatives. 

By the same token, I’m somewhat daunted that what if I fuck it up & they don’t really learn anything? 

Shit. 

I’m leaning towards just saying yes and accepting the placement. I do think it’s the right thing to do & I’m pretty sure it says somewhere in the Hippocratic oath about passing on knowledge. 

Then again, I’m pretty sure it also says I have to live a life of chastity and sacrifice a goat to a moon god or something. So yeah, whatevs. 

Given that my own kids ignore me, it might actually be nice to have someone who thinks I’m awesome and hangs off my every word, soaking up everything like a sponge. 

It’ll be a bit of extra work around the place, but what do my colleagues here, think? 

A noble & worthy opportunity to mould and shape a young, inquisitive mind?

Or a clusterfuck of epic proportions waiting to happen, that will devolve into the poor youngster watching me scream at the printer when it keeps telling me to clear the paper jam in tray 5 when I’ve already cleared that fucker out 9 times already this morning? 

TL/DR:

Do I accept a medical student for placement at my practice or is it not worth the hassle (or they’ll see how disorganised I am and how I keep losing pens etc)?

Lord knows where that came from, I can't tell. And it's only this one specific drug that seems sooo appealing to me.

So, new place, new people. I just need the guts to approach someone. Yes I wanna do it and yet I know I shouldn't. The reasonable voices say no, but there's that single one screaming so damn loudly. So, yeah. Yes, I absolutely know the answer to ""should I"" is always going to be *NO*. I've spend so many nights browsing the Internet on this topic, I've read your stories and responses in this subreddit. Yet still... one of the voices is still screaming for it. It's like 5 of my personalities are doing everything to contain the one that wants to spiral off into the abyss. I can read so much about why not but I seem unable to make my brain understand it.

I just want my thoughts to shut up. This is exhausting. Make it stop.

So, uhm... any ideas? How do you guys deal with your cravings? And thanks for reading if you made it that far.",1544748299.0

A month ago or so, 42 of my scripted Tramadol were stolen. I take them for Fibromyalgia, without them, I can't function due to pain and also get withdrawals, as I have been taking them since February.

Most of the OD's are being caused by Fentanyl or Heroin (correct me if I'm wrong) not by a few Hydrocodone for severe pain or an early refill of a TRAMADOL script for a chronic pain patient.

Then 30 mins late took 50 mg promethazine, felt nauseous ever since , 3 hours later ..  been drinking loads of water ,  resting , eat some bread . 

 The reason I took the anti histamine after i had taken the codeine , was I had seen serval people say to take a anti histamine ( promethazine for me ) 30 mins / when you start feeling the high kicking in .

I have never got nauseous before as I usual take the codeine + promethazine together or sometimes take the prom 20 mins before .

I guess people react different ...

My advice never take your anti histamine after dropping ya opiate!!

That’s when I popped the 40, smoked a joint and came back in the house. Within an Hour, I started sweating like crazy, almost like i was in withdrawals, and i’ve never went through any withdrawals ever.  i’m just assuming that’s what a withdrawal feels like since I’ve seen people go through withdrawals. I started feeling really light headed and nauseous, and my heart kept on giving me pain. So i went to the washroom to force myself to puke, and i did. I felt better almost instantly.

But damnit I love all of you and things are getting better.

I’m so stoked right now. My life is falling back into place after I’ve stopped feeling sorry for myself all the time. I’m finally starting to take the initiative to go out and make things better. Hard work is uncomfortable after getting so used to the instant gratification of getting high all the time.

I’m starting to remember the feelings that real success and accomplishments bring. It’s completely opposite of instant gratification. Instead of a temporary false sense of euphoria and comfort, you work hard for a long time and that success makes you feel whole and genuinely happy as a human. It’s a much better feeling knowing that you deserve the good feelings you have and that you worked for them.

So I’m 24 years old.

I didn’t score the ‘best’ job in the world but I finally have a solid job paying $15.50 / hour and $22.75 overtime. And this job leaves lots of room for moving up in the business and making it a career if it works out.

May not sound like a crazy amount of money. But I need to take what I can get right now. I’ve been a guitar teacher for years and that was really solid money per hour, but it was extremely inconsistent and unreliable. I also gave up most of that work after going to treatment this last time. It’s also been so hard to get what I had going again.

So I’ve been job hunting for a month or so.  
Just recently had 3 interviews and all of them led to an offer for a position.  
The first two were super low pay. $10.25 an hour  or $9.75... but I needed to take what I could get. It sucks because I have the skills to teach the guitar lessons and make up to $50 an hour; but that doesn’t translate to many other fields in terms of experience.

I’m done rambling... just so stoked. Another important thing is that my coworkers and the environment are super legit. In my opinion this has a HUGE impact on the job and honestly the quality of life in general. 

As long as I pass this 9 panel I’m good to go. Hopefully bupe doesn’t show up. I know I could use fake piss but I’d rather not have to deal with all of that.

I have plans to try the new sublocade injections and then taper off completely. Only when I’m ready. Right now it’s helping me tremendously so I’m in no rush to get off.

Sounds silly but I have plans to have my mother managing my finances; I need her to. I’m not  currently thinking about relapsing, but I don’t want to even risk it. I know how quickly things can go to shit.",1544726105.0

I’ve used almost everything imaginable in front of him with little judgement. A year ago he drew the line at heroin and meth, Ive crossed that obviously. I have a prescription for narcan and do my absolute best to control my use. He is a no addict that doesn’t fully understand how intense the struggle truly is even after watching me withdrawal. I’m honestly not going to or don’t want to stop anytime soon since medical issues leave me fed pills for “comfort.”

My parents were surprisingly non judgmental and said they knew before I even told them. I went back home for a visit in October. They saw my tracks and after about 8 hours of throwing up I had to be honest because they way I was getting looked at rubbed my emotions. 

Can y’all share stories of educating your loved ones? Did they leave or were they non judgmental? Did you hide your use, do what you want or get sober?

Supposedly this is a more efficient way to get high, get bigger rush or something like that. I am a bit skeptical, because by the time you draw blood again, the dope would be deep in your system already and even if it weren't, I don't see how would shooting it several times get you higher.

By all accounts my life has been good when I'm clean- I generally smile on a day to day basis and when I relapse I get into a state of desperation almost immediatly. I mean full blown fiend mode kicks in and I'm overdosing and suffering other severe consequences in a matter of days. It's really progressed to where my runs can not be longer than a week or two- and honestly I'm miserable the whole time. 

The thing is I struggle with coping with life- and opiates at some point used to relieve me with that duty. They do not do that anymore. They add depression and a heavy weight of addiction to whatever problems or feelings I may have. When I lost my baby recently I got high immediatly and was immeditately in a worst place than I was before. I got clean for a month after that and couldn't shake the sadness and did the same thing again. Went on a week run and destroyed a lot- ended up in a detox and have been clean for 1.5 months since then. 

I'm getting over the sadness slowly and I have my good and bad days- but I have a great job, great friends, I work a solid recovery program- I see that my life will clearly be pretty good if I don't get high. However, my loneliness and heartbreak since my girl left me (right after the baby thing) makes me want to get high. It doesn't make any sense- I've tried to deal with this problem by getting high and I have direct evidence that it does not work- but I hate feeling this way- and in my mind heroin fixes it. 

However lonely I am without her- heroin will isolate me even further- it causes me to ruminate on my problems, to lose hope, to tell myself I have a reason to get high because of the pain I'm in. It's a positive feedback loop that only increases the pain. 

Idk what the point of this post is other than to vent that its super irritating to fully know that I'm lying to myself but still somewhat believe those lies. Addiction is a bitch mayne. ",1544712117.0

Trying to figure out if using it around dose time is going to effect my oxycodone and how..... and really there is a lack of information online.

I know someone is going to say that it can make you have less of a chance in the off chance you have in the first place of your body converting oxycodone to oxymorphone 

To be honest I never tried oxymorphone and I’m sure that little automatic random conversion can explain why on occasion you get a nice feel that’s not always there but I will not base my decision on this.

I also think this a nice thread to have up and can benefit us and beyond to get this straight because I’m pretty sure I’m not the only one that needs to find this out 

So I have 5 slipped discs in my lumbar spine + a lot of other injuries and inflammation with my lower back, hip, got cut down in qty of pills and dose for the moment due to a error and just have to deal with that. Went from 90 7.5 hydro to 60 5mg and I’m not making it through till it can be fixed back which normally I’m fine with and it’s only a couple of weeks that I have to wait but

I’m pretty sure I may have broken my ankle yesterday and need to make thing stretch and don’t have a choice for the next 2 weeks 

My back actually hurts worse then my ankle but it’s starting to get hard to walk, yes you can walk on a broken ankle...at least I can and I have in the last...done it twice actually but that was when I was in middle school and not in my early 30’s. I more then know it’s a lot easier then vs now. Not that I’m old but not much is required then vs now.

TLDR - 

does cbd potentate oxycodone and othet opiates?

What is the effect that it has on them? Is it good, is it bad? 

I know it could effect the ability and off chance that your body can make its own oxymorphone but not much else and there’s not much available when searching 

Maybe have broken ankle on top of bad back and hip injuries and have to stretch for the next two weeks

Idk if anyone remember me posting some months back about my wife and I trying to get clean, wanted to tell y’all what happened.

We were using fent (was sold to us as oxy) and got very strung out. We weren’t paying bills, missing work, and neglecting our daughter. It was bad. 

On September 8th I picked up a sack of 10 and brought it home, we each did a few like normal. I smoked a bowl and went to bed. I woke up randomly at around 2:30 am to find my wife had overdosed. I did everything I could and called an ambulance but it was too late. She had kept doing them after I fell asleep. 

CPS put my daughter with my parents and I moved in with my sister. Since that day I have been sober. I have been going to 12 step meetings and a counselor to help deal with everything.

I’m now in my own place and back to work. I see my daughter every day or so and I still go to meetings. 

I share this with y’all not for pity or for some kind of woe is me post, but to warn of the dangers of this game. By all means if you can use responsibly and keep your shit together go for it but please be safe.

I also want to say if you are looking for a way out, there is one. Shit there are multiple ways to get out. You can do this, it’s not easy but can be done. I myself went straight cold turkey and was in an AA meeting the day after my wife died. Detox sucks I know but you can make it through.

If anyone needs to vent or wants any kind of help, I’m here and there are multiple people who are willing to listen/help.

Ok I’ll get off my soap box now. Thanks.",1544668654.0

I’m 24 and I’ve been using opiates for years. Last year in April / May I discovered snorting heroin and have been feeling trapped ever since.

I’m actually on subs now actually and have been for a few months but I still relapse every couple weeks for a couple days at a time. I was planning to get the sublocade injection and thought it would help.

All of this is besides the point though.

I am literally such a piece of shit and I have become everything I never wanted to be. Shortly after my last stint in rehab I was in an IOP.  It just finished a few weeks ago.

Basically I found my mom’s medicine and knowing that she doesn’t use it often (absolutely NO excuse) I took a total of 2 scripts of ambien (60 total) and probably like 100 hydros. I was taking a few pills everyday for weeks. When she didn’t find out I tried to justify it in my head. Well I thought I’d be ‘smart’ and replace the empty ambien bottles with Advil. My mom’s not stupid even though the shape is the same. 

Needless to say, she found out today. And instead of lying this time, I was completely honest. I’m such a piece of shit. 
What happened to me? Where did I start to go wrong? I’m seriously such a loser and I have nothing going for me... snooping in my parent’s room and stealing their medication. Talk about LOW. Fuck me.

Thanks for listening guys. I’m leaving my house now and going homeless for the first real time. Got layers of clothes, water, and a sleeping bag. So shitty. I was supposed to start a new job tomorrow too. Fucked that up because there’s no way my mom wants anything to do with me.

And also all my family already knows I’m a heroin addict. They thought I’ve been doing better but what my mom tells them is going to make me look like the junkie loser that I am.

Fuck this life. I’m pathetic. It’s like I’m so numb emotionally but all I can do is cry.

I fucked up, because I am stupid. My package with insulin needles didn't arrive, so I said fuck it and tried it with a syringe with an extremly thick and long needle. It was so hard to get the needle to puncture the skin, but eventually I was in ""something"". I could move the needle freely around in what felt like a vein, it bled. I wasn't skilled enough to successfully pull back the plunger to see if I was in a vein and after a bit, I said fuck it again and just pushed the plunger.

I did get a little bit of an effect, but only a barely noticable one.

When I pulled the needle out, blood came out very quickly.

My tolerance is low, so I only needed to inject 0.3ml of liquid. Now there is a little bump, it doesn't hurt at all, but it's there, maybe 2mm long, 1mm thick and 1mm tall. I can pinch it, but nothing happens, nothing comes out, or something like that.

So my friend came to me today and showed me his White Heroin which he ordered from Thailand (Deep web). He had a EZ test with him and we tested it and it was very very very pure ! 
He asked if I could hold it for him for a while because he is going away for vacation and doesn’t want it at his home. 

I’ve experience with opioids. I tried Codeine twice and also used oxycodone a handful of times this year. When I use Oxy I mostly need to take 30/40mg before feeling anything even with zero tolerance. Don’t now really why i need to take so much but lower dosage don’t do anything for me !

I am very interested in maybe trying Heroin but I am always concerned of ODing. I don’t want to die because of a stupid fucking drug so I want to take the safest way possible. I was planning to take a small key bump with the amount of match head and wait 30 min to maybe redose when needed. Is this safe to do this way ? 

EDIT: I am not going to try it ! Risk are way to high just to get high for 2/3 hours !! Fuck that shit ! Thanks for all the information reddit ! You saved my life !

After about 4 hrs blood started coming out, so I went to the E.R. The doctor was rather snotty to me and was treating me like a drug seeker. I did not ask anyone for meds. I just told them my symptoms. The doctor was like “we’ll just see if you really have blood coming out, as he was putting on his gloves”. He proceeded to jam a finger in my butt and then his tone changed. He started to get sympathetic and said I was indeed bleeding internally.  They quickly ran blood tests and gave me a CT scan and found nothing, but my diarrhea looked like ground up raw liver so they new I was in pain so I was admitted for more tests. After 4 hrs, I was finally given something for the pain. It was called Nubain. I had not heard of it before. The nurse injected it rather fast. I’m pretty sure they are supposed to inject narcotics over a 5 min period. It took her less than 30 secs. I was so messed up I was drooling on myself! If it had been anywhere else, I would’ve thought I was overdosing. I nodded out for I think about 20 mins. Then I just felt really high for about an hour and was pain free for 3 hrs total. I was given Nubain every 3 hrs. After the 3rd dose it wasn’t working as good, but I had no pain . I continued to have bloody diarrhea for the next 24 hrs. Then it subsided. The Gastroenterologist said they couldn’t find anything. They think it was a bout of Ulcerative Colitis. I was given IV antibiotics and the antifungal Flagyl as a precautionary and sent home the next day. I was sent home with a script of Vicodin to help any residual pain and to wean off the heavy amount of Nubain. I was shocked!! They never send people home with concerns of withdrawal. I ended up saving the 30 Vicodin and used them when my back went out 6 months later. So, has anyone else had this drug called Nubain?

My friend came over today and asked if I could hold his white Heroin for a couple of days. He said it came straight out of Thailand (Dark Web) and we tested it with EZ Test and it came out very very pure ! I have a couple of experiences in the past with opioids (Oxy and Codeine) but never really thought of using heroin because the heroin we get here is brown and you can’t snort it. It’s more used for smoking or injection wich I have no interest in ! Because this will maybe be the last time that I ever get my hands on white and pure heroin I thought about trying it !

Would it be okay if I try it in the evening (about 20 hours after taking Xanax) or should I better wait until tomorrow ? 

And maybe any Tipps on first Time heroin and best way to snort it ? I am planning on doing small bumps every 15 min until I feel something. Good idea ? 

Thanks for the help and I know how dangerous and addictive heroin is but as I said it will be almost impossible to get my hands on it again so why not try it.

I've searched a bit on Google, but I've gotten somewhat contradicting answers considering how interchangably the ""oxycodone"" and ""oxycontin"" are used. I realize that ""oxycontin"" is a brand of extended release oxycodone. However, what I fail to understand or, rather, what I fail to decide is whether oxycodone (something like percocet) or oxycontin is the right thing for me. 

I've been using morphine for quite a while and recently was given the choice between 40mg oxycodone or 20mg oxycontin. I'm unsure of whether I should go for the former or the latter and was wondering if you guys could give your 5 cents. I'd get 28 pills in both cases. If these sort of posts aren't allowed then sorry.

Edit: Turns out the oxycodone wasn't combined with APAP as I originally thought, so the question is basically 40mg oxycodone IR vs 20mg oxycodone ER. Guess I'll take the former!",1544610752.0

Clocked in and at work and I start to feel it a bit more and as it started to come down, I took 1mg of a Xanax and that shit hittt tf out of me. It was like someone put a spell on me and holy shit I began to feel sleepy and drowsy as shit, my friend who works with me was the only one that knew what I was on and told me to just get out, don’t drive home but told me that I can’t be here otherwise I’ll definitely get my ass fired.

—————

I’m a chronic pain patient (Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, Fibromyalgia, and a host of back issues... so it’s mainly just my joints, bones, and muscles, everywhere in my entire body).  

—————

***BACKGROUND:*** My doctor put me on 50mcg Fentanyl patches (I’d been getting the brand name, Duragesic, because they stick best through showering, sweat, and movement and they seem to have the most steady delivery vs. some of the generics).  I also take six 10mg Hydrocodone pills throughout the day for breakthrough pain.  I was recently put on Medicare through my disability, and my plan (Humana), paid for the first month of Duragesic patches and then sent a letter saying they wouldn’t do it again, and I was expecting that they just needed a prior auth to demonstrate that I’d been on the patches for years now and that I’d taken all the prerequisite medications to justify them but I guess that’s not happening.

—————

***The proposed alternatives for the Duragesic patches are:***  

- Morphine ER Tab
- [Xtampza](https://www.empr.com/xtampza-er/drug/34583/) (generic: Oxycodone)
- [Embeda](https://www.empr.com/embeda/drug/34446/) (generic: Morphine sulfate + naltrexone HCl)

I’ve never heard of Xtampza or Embeda before and that makes me nervous.  It took... a long time to finally find the right combination of medications and I’m still in pain — I’m never *not* in pain, but the patches help to work 24 hours a day and I take two 10mg Hydrocodone in the morning, afternoon, and evening.

——————

I would greatly appreciate any personal advice or recommendations so I can discuss what seems like the best alternative medication with my doctor.  If anyone happens to know the appropriate equivalent dosage for a 50mcg fentanyl patch in an extended release medication, that would also be helpful.  I’m not sure if maybe a better route is finding a more powerful medication that works all day and night so I don’t take the Hydrocodone for breakthrough pain as well.  So again, I’m grateful for any help or advice, and I apologize in advance if this isn’t the right place for this.",1544579002.0

What better than anonymously on a forum full of people who will understand.

This is gonna be a long one, so if you wanna get to the part where I talk about the spiritual experience I had of shitting, just scroll down until you see **TL;DR**. For the shortest version of this post possible just read the **SHIT-TIME** section.

-----------**BACKGROUND**---------------

So I'm not a stranger to constipation, but it's never been this bad. The last time I had constipation that comes even close to what I had last night was about 2-3 years ago. I was drinking [opium tea] daily (back when it was actually strong) and after a month of this I had barely shit. I used magnesium citrate and a hot bath and was able to get it out, and bled for the first time from shitting (which made me want to puke). 

(Edit: I forgot to mention that during the ""opium tea"" constipation I had, I also caught a fuckin stomach bug. It was my 3rd day visiting family and I made some eggs. Turns out the eggs were 3 weeks past their good by date, and my family had just never been damned to throw them away, so I ate them and got sick. I'd wake with a super strong urge to shit and end up pissing out of my ass - I'd straight up shit clear water every day, while the actual shit was stuck and I was constipated. Pretty awful.)

Flash forward now and I haven't had much problems with constipation because I have been using kratom exclusively for the last 5 months. The main problem now was I was noticing blood in my stool more than half the time I would shit. No real constipation though. At this point I'd gotten used to the blood and would clean myself in the shower if I ever saw it. It still makes me sick but idk what to do.

Anyways, here's where the real story starts: for the last month and a half I've been using suboxone every day, I replaced kratom with subs. Usually 2-4mg a day.

I didn't really realize it, but as the weeks went by I didn't shit. And I was eating a normal amount + days with big meals.

By the 4th week I'd realized I hadn't taken a real shit in a while, just pebbles like 4 times in the last 4 weeks. I also noticed I would sometimes need to push a little bit to pee.

Then I tried to poop, and it wouldn't come out. It was stuck.

So I started drinking magnesium citrate and was able to get a small, dense one out.

A couple days pass and I try again. This time it hurts and is completely stuck. I start to worry and realize how fucked I am. That was 8 days ago, and I realized then that there would be eventual retribution, that I had to pay the price.

As well, 8 days ago I ran out of subs and used kratom the entire week. Yesterday I got more subs and have been using them since. The week of just kratom got my bowels moving more.

So that day I started the kratom I bought solid and liquid glycerin suppositorys, more magnesium citrate, and miralax. That night I put in the solid glycerin one and kept it in for two days before I had to go. When I tried to poop, it was a solid conglomerate of smaller dense pebbled. It wasn't shaped right to come out so I shot some of the liquid glycerin to help get it out. It burned like a bitch. After 10 minuted I peed glycerin out if my ass, and then was able to shit. The glycerin had broken the conglomerate into chunks. That was about 6 days ago.

If you'd total all of my shit since starting bup, it would have been worth 2-4 nornal shits, except possibly much denser.

-------------**TL;DR**---------------------

So yesterday I wake up in WD with the strong urge to shit, but I had to go get my subs so I put the shitting off. I got and dosed half a strip of subs and just held in the shit cus I could tell it was gonna be painful.

Later that day, when the urge got too strong, I tried to shit. It would just barely come out and got stuck, which was extremely painful. I realized this wasn't gonna come out without tearing my ass, unless I did something. It was just so dense, hard, and dry. As well, what I didn't realize was that this shit was mishapen. It was a conglomerate of mid sized pebbles that was shaped extremely weird, it had a cavitation in the middle, like a cup, that was pointing out of my ass, and it had sides that were too long 

So I made the really hard choice and *sucked it back into my asshole*. I aborted mission. It hurt so bad doing that but I was honestly too scared to continue trying, and wasn't eager to test whether my asshole or the shit was stronger. I also noticed my stomach looked distended, fat, even though I'm extremely skinny and have almost no body fat.

I made a plan: I'd give myself a liquid glycerin suppository + the same amount of water up my ass, and retain it/hold it in there until tomorrow, to give it time to soften the shit up and hopefully it'd break apart. 

So later that night at 11, after eating an entire small thin crust papa johns pizza, I decided I'd do it now.

I covered the tip of the liquid suppository syringe with petroleum jelly/vaseline, and shot glycerin up there. Then I refilled it with water and shot water uo there. Then another bulb full of water. Then I washed my hands and laid down in bed, I didn't really get an urges to shit.

Until 3 hours later, when I got an extremely strong urge to go. I raced to the bathroom and shit out pure liquid shit. So dark I couldn't see through it but pure liquid. No solids. I could tell I didn't get anything substantial out. I could tell because the same solid shit as before was trying to get out but like before it couldn't get out, and hurt so bad. I sucked it back in after all the liquid was evacuated.

So I drank a spoonfull of miralax + like 3 doses of magnesium citrate and a lot of water. Then an idea: maybe I could also use one of the solid suppositorys overnight. See, at this point I was terrified of what was gonna happen. Opiates make me scared of shitting because of how painful it can be.

So I applied more vaseline to my butthole and shoved a solid glycerin suppository in there until it was deep in. It kinda hurt. Not because of the burn or anything, I didn't feel that. But because at the end of the suppository, facing out of my ass, was a cup. 

It's hard to describe over writing but it basically has a shelf at the bottom, like a cup. The edges extend but it's hollow. And the edges felt sharp and was rubbing against my colon. I tried getting it out but the vaseline formed a vacuum and the more I tried to get it out the more the edges of the end rubbed and hurt my rectum.

A good analogy would be that it felt like a lego brick was stuck in my asshole.

Then I wondered whether these things actually dissolve. I put a new solid suppository in my sink and ran hot water over it for a while. Nothing happened, it looked exactly the same. Btw, it was the exact same the next morning. What the fuck is even the point of these things if they don't dissolve.

So now I basically had a solid buttplug in that wasn't gonna dissolve. And it hurt, any movement I made it hurt.

So I just tried to pretend nothing was wrong and go to sleep. I took some melatonin and layed down and tried to ignore the fact that any time I made the slightest movement my asshole would hurt. 

After about an hour or two of this, I had the urge to piss (from all the water I drank for the magnesium and miralax). And I had to shit. Urgently.

-------------**SHIT-TIME**----------------

So I stumbled to the bathroom, walking funny to avoid my ass hurting from the glycerin butt plug, and tried to piss. But nothing was coming out. And when I tried to push, I could feel shit being pushed out. Not wanting to diarrhea all over my pants and underwear, I sat on the toilet. But it wasn't enough... So I took off my pants/underwear and squated on the ground. Here's where it gets fun.

I still wasn't able to pee, but immediately a bunch more liquid comes out of my ass and all over the bathroom floor. Same stuff as before, dark liquid shit. I said fuck it and took off my shirt and reached my hand to my ass. I had pushed enough and was able to easily retrieve the solid suppository, which was still completely solid and the exact same as before. I threw it away in the toilet. 

I decided that since I'd already got the suppository out I might as well try to manipulate the shit in me and maybe try to get it to come out. I felt around the shit and realized that it was almost hooking over my ass from the inside. Some of it was out, some of it was inside but too far sideways thus my ass couldn't handle the width, and because of how dense it was it wasn't breaking. I started manually pushing and breaking. And what's funny was that I wasn't actually even able to break it, that's how strong it was, I couldn't break it with my hands. I pushed it in, pulled, pushed my taint, etc, just messing around with it. And the entire time this was happening I was in massive pain. 

I then decided to quit and stood up. And then I felt a shift. I jumped in the shower and started pushing and it rapidly started coming out more then it had before. It got stuck again so I grabbed it, this time it was actually starting to come out. This entire time I was repeating the word fuck and god no and was in massive pain. When it got stuck again I actually tried to suck it back in because of how much pain I was in but it was already too far out, which I realized when I touched it. I pulled it with my hand and clenched my ass to hopefully break it between my glorius sphincter, and I started feeling the familiar feeling of your ass releasing and closing around shit as it lets go. Suddenly it was free, and suddenly I was holding a piece of shit like a goddamn monkey. The release felt amazing. And don't forget, the entire time I was standing up.

I held it. It was a monster, a ball the size of a small orange and the density of a neutron star. I sighed in relief...

**But wait, there's more!**

I suddenly realized I had more. I dropped the shit in my hand on the shower tiles. At first I thought all of the pain and  urgency I'd been experiencing all day was from the shit I had just shit, and I fully expected the next load to just be small comfortable pieces that had simply been blocked. Because of this mistaken belief, I pushed hard. Within 15 seconds it was already getting pretty far out of my ass and I realized the mistake I had made. This was the true monster. The uncomfortableness and pain of it merged in my mind and honestly it hurt so bad I became dissociated, which almost numbed the pain. The second this happened I just started repeating ""Oh my god, it's so big, please no, I can't believe this is happening, how is this even possible it's too big"" over and over again. Once it was out halfway I felt it and pulled a little bit and this finished it off. The feeling of my asshole and rectum slipping over the end of it and retracting was both extremely uncomfortable, painful, and almost welcoming because it meant I wasn't prolapsing and that it was over. That last second as my ass finally retracted on itself and fully expelled the shit was glorious. The last half of it exiting felt like a crescendo, almost spiritual, 100% an altered state, the last 20 seconds of it exiting had this energy that built up until it exploded right at the end. Like the opposite of an orgasm and extremely painful and completely non-sexual. In retrospect it came out in a very healthy way, it's like after the initial blockage was released my body was super eager to get the stuff behind it out and orchestrated the effort perfectly.

It exited my ass and fell right into my hand, and as it did I could already tell it was heavy. I moved my hand to my front and examined the shit in disbelief. It was, by far and without a doubt, the widest shit I have ever shit. I honestly couldn't believe it. It was fucking huge. It was about a fist and a half wide and 8 inchs long. This will sound absolutely ridiculous, but I almost felt proud, and I definitely felt relieved, standing there in the shower naked, holding shit. 

I dropped the monster on the tiles and stood there in disbelief for a minute or two, basking in the feeling of absolute relief. My asshole felt honestly kinda good because it was finally completely relaxed, the entire day it had been puckering constantly in order to hold all the shit in but now it could just be free. I checked my stomach in the mirror and it looked completely normal. I then realized I still had to pee and tried to and peed normally there in the shower which was amazing because the pressure that had been blocking my urinary tract was now gone.

After another minute or two of disbelief and joy I began cleaning up. Threw the shit in the toilet (which it immediately clogged), cleaned the floor, and then turned on the shower and took a very long, cleansing shower. Washed the shower tiles, washed my body completely, washed my ahole out. After I got out of the shower I took a big glob of petroleum jelly and rubbed the outside and a little bit of the inside of my butthole with it. Surprisingly I didn't see any blood during this whole ordeal whatsoever which is funny considering how big it was compared to nornal ones, but I still applied vaseline just incase.

After spraying bleach cleaner fucking everywhere in the bathroom and getting dressed with new clothes I fell into bed in utter spiritual relief and browsed on my phone before falling asleep.

If I had known how everything would turn out, and if I had known how it would have felt, I probably would've tried to have avoided it all costs and just hold it in. But now that it's over and I got that shit out, I feel so much better, and am glad it happened. I think constipation where you have lots of shit built up is extremely unhealthy and I'm glad I've gotten a mini-reset. Even though I took a ton of miralax and magnesium citrate yesterday I haven't had any urge whatsoever to shit today, not even a tiny one, and no gas. I know that I'll be taking magnesium citrate and miralax every day from now on to make sure a blockage like that never developes again. I've learned my lesson.

What I think happened was the multiple doses of magnesium citrate and miralax I had been taking ended up rehydrating and fusing multiple logs of shit into one, like a shit mutant hybrid. The initial blockage had been preventing these logs their exit and when I soaked them with laxatives they all fused into one.

Anyways, I hope you guys found that enjoyable/entertaining or relatable. I might delete this because of how disgusting it is but I'm interested in hearing some responses or others people's stories. Cheers.",1544571199.0

&#x200B;

I feel I need to start with a bit of a back story, so here it goes. I first used codeine around 5 years ago by using the CWE method with a friend. I really enjoyed it and always wanted to try it again. Around 8 months ago, I found a reliable source for pure (no APAP) pharmaceutical codeine tablets 30mg. I took around 5 of these tablets every Saturday as a treat and quickly remembered how amazing the stuff makes you feel with no tolerance! Once these had ran out I decided to try dihydrocodeine (again, no APAP) just pure 30mg tablets. Dihydrocodeine is said to be around 1.5x stronger than codeine, but I feel the strength of the high is the same, just different. Dihydrocodeine feels a lot more ""speedy"" and seems to last a lot longer (up to 8 hours) in my opinion.

Before long I was using the dihydrocodeine at work on quiet days, but to my amazement I actually worked a lot better on it! Boring tasks suddenly felt fun, I was no longer getting fatigued or craving junk food, all my anxieties of talking to customers had suddenly disappeared. I simply felt amazing!

I continued to use every other day, until one weekend I went to stay at a friends house, leaving my dihydrocodeine at home. The second day I woke up with awful diarrhea and felt terribly anxiety, I assumed I had eaten something bad the day before and had a touch of food poisoning. The next day came and I felt worse, I had everything from the second day but with added chills and incredible aches in my muscles, at that point it dawned on me, I was in withdrawal. I got home that night and started researching about it, how long it would last ect. and decided to stick it out, for the next few days the diarrhea subsided but the chills/aches continued, but I powered on using non-opiate pain killers and small amounts of phenibut and alcohol in the evenings to help me through it.

Around 7 days from the start, I finally felt normal again.

About a month ago I decided to start using again a few days a week, and of course, I've slipped back into daily use. I am going through a stressful and unique period in my life, I am busy at work as well as studying for a qualification that wont finish until the middle of next year and the dihydrocodeine helps me so much! SO my question is...can I keep using dihydrocodeine to help me through this period? I am currently using about 120-180mg per day and my tolerance doesn't seem to have increased that much. I have two very reliable sources so its unlikely I will run out it suddenly, and even if I did I always make sure to have a least 30 tablets in reserve just in case I need them to taper off.  I also have no way of getting stronger opiates even if I wanted to, so I'm not going to jump up a level.

What do you all think? Can I carry on using for now and taper off in a couple of months? Or am I harming myself in some way and should quit as soon as possible?

Thanks for reading all that and for any replies!

&#x200B;

\*EDIT\*

I suppose what I'm asking is if I continue using will I be able to quit with similar ease as last time or am I missing something? Also am I causing any damage to myself?

This equals about $1000/week and $52000(!)/year, which is absolutely insane to me because I’m really not even getting THAT high. 

So I always hear about how everyone switches from pills to dope because they are too expensive. My question is, at this level of use how much would you end up spending per week by switching to dope. Also secondly, how fast does your tolerance build from this point. With pills it feels like I gotta up the dose every mf day if I’m actually trying to nod out.

Any personal experience? Better alternatives?

I turned to opiates for the sense of well being as an alternative to suicide. I had a date & a plan, so I figured why not.

It was actually going pretty well, got myself into therapy, started investing in my well being... unfortunately sourcing is an issue now & I'm doing a taper while staving off withdrawal with some super pure kratom alkaloids. I don't mind being a functional addict, but I'm not willing to live a junkie's life so no cold copping & being on the brink of disaster & w/d for me.

* 56% mitragynine
* 15% paynantheine
* 11% speciogynine
* 16% Speciociliatine

by weight, which is pretty effective.

Had I started this from a position of strength I would have gotten a big supply of a synthetic opioid with nice long legs & tried to minimize my tolerance with ultra low doses of naltrexone.

Unfortunately those are all gone as far as I know & I couldn't get them if they were.

So what are my options?  I have health insurance, but even a medically assisted detox will leave me at best in the same situation I was before this started.

It's ironic that the state couldn't be arsed to get involved during my decade of childhood physical & emotional abuse, neglect, alienation from all friends, families or allies while being raised by a woman with a personality disorder. That fucked up my brain chemistry pretty well,

But as an adult tax payer who never hurt anyone, once I start to tweak it back the state needs to intervene.

Right away I knew it was off in weight but I didn't have my scale with me (I won't drive with a scale since that is considered to be paraphernalia i.e. felony charge) so I headed home at a crawl so I could weigh it and get confirmation on what I already believed was a purposefully planted, total mental mind fuck. I kept going back and forth in my head... ""This isn't off by that much, I'm just blowing this out of proportion in my head!"" To ""Holy shit, he totally fucking gave me a shitload of dope! He had to have done it on purpose to see if I'd be honest and let him know about the mistake quick enough to prove that I'm a loyal customer?"" Which one is it? What am I!? A loyal adict or a thief? Of course I'm freaking out more and more as the moments pass. It takes about 30 minutes to get home after scoring, so every second that passes that I don't call him and explain the situation to make it right, is a possible strike against me and a possible lost connect. But I couldn't even fathom calling without getting the confirmation in my head on what was exactly given to me. Mistake or not. So I drove home in a sweat, continuously palming and squeezing the huge chunks in my hands trying to guess the amount of dope I had been given and running through the various scenarios that could have possibly transpired. As more and more time passes, I'm also trying to determine if I should even say anything. If he had realized his mistake then I surely would have received a call by now. 5 minutes turn to 10 and I'm just shaking and sifting through the different options. Can I just pretend I got the right amount? Would he be able to tell or figure out who was given the wrong amount? How many people did he sell to tonight? How many people does he have running for him? Was the guy himself reliable? Does he have a habit and he's just totally out of it right now and doesn't know what he's doing? I could just pretend that I got my normal amount.. I'd have saved over $4000 worth of dope by just keeping my mouth shut. Holy crap that's a shit load of money I could save.
I finally get home and weigh it and it says 60gs. My frantically beating heart drops into my stomach and I realize I've got to be honest and call my dboy to explain what happened or I could risk a shit storm I'm not prepared for. He didn't even fucking realize he had given me the wrong amount. Jesus. He asks me to drive to meet him to return the extra dope and promptly hangs up. I'm sitting there pissed off and then I immediately get a call back. ""Go ahead and take 4g's for yourself. Thanks!""

Wow.. Thanks? Gotta change my soiled shorts and I'll be right there. 

TL;DR: Dboy gave me 60g's instead of 7g's by mistake. Called dboy to explain what happened and he gave me 4g's for free. ",1544505703.0

I do much better with injections that last longer. Sublocade is an option but I don’t want Bupe any more.

I was prescribed 16mg a day and had about a week or two long run of using. I started my Bupe again today. I’ve taken 12mg today. 

I want to do as quick of a taper as I can so I can get the 7-10 days of clean time free from all opiates to start Vivitrol. 

I plan on telling my provider about my slip on Wednesday at my appointment. Until then I’ll continue taking the Bupe that I do have. I have a few doses left. 

So obviously I haven’t been on 16mg like I should be so what do you guys suggest? Start taking the 16 again and then tell my provider I want to do a rapid taper? What do you guys suggest? I’m pretty dead set on doing rapid taper over a month or two of tapering. I just want off this stuff. 

Any comfort medicines besides clonidine, methocarbanol, and something for anxiety, that I should ask for?

Please help! I’m desperate and just want off this shit. If you don’t have anything helpful to provide or share please just leave those to yourself. I’m not trying to be a dick, I just want helpful information.

I don't mind giving them a bump here and there, but as we know the cost of pills adds up, particularly when you make $10 an hour, even though I do get a great deal$ on them, still expensive when you have the tolerance of a lab monkey (sorry PETA).

   They, as a couple def pull more money than me, but they cringe at the possibility of spending $7-$10 on a pill (for 20 mg), as I have offered to purchase pills for them or sell them a few of mine. When I have them they suddenly want to get together, phone calls are more frequent etc.

Granted, I am much much more social on them as well, and they are the only people that would be cool with it...so it is nice having the company at times but I do laugh to myself. Also, if the shoes were reversed I would be the same way, but at least I would pay for them. I am not angry or resentful but I recently gained clarity of the situation and it kind of makes me laugh as they are not subtle. 

   They seem to be aggravated (would never admit) when I have told them I can't afford to share with them all the time. They are friends beyond the drugs it is just funny how it changes the dynamics of SO MANY relationships.

   I'm sure I am not the only person who has experienced this, I would like to hear what other people have seen when they have drugs, like all of a sudden that chick you didn't have a chance with starts hitting on you ETC etc etc. It really is funny",1544480133.0

Went to get what was supposed to be “opium”.... got a look at it and it was BTH. Already paid for.... might as well see what the fuss is about. Think I paid like 60 or 80 per gram? Don’t remember much for a few weeks of this time period so I honestly can’t say... but I do know it wasn’t that expensive to me. 

Now, I have a friend who sells it. Has been asking if I want any, I might. But I don’t know about his prices.... dude is saying he usually won’t sell in grams, just balls. 200$ per ball, and if he has to do a gram it would be 100$.... this seems extremely steep for BTH. But I really don’t know.... I’ve always seen and heard that heroin is cheap as fuck. 

What’s going on here? Is he trying to dupe me or what? 

Idk if I’m even gonna get any. Opiates aren’t my thing but the H high did feel nice once the nausea went away haha... I’m just curious about these prices honestly. Seem weird to me, almost like coke prices. 

EDIT: maybe it’s dosage per price that I’m confused about. I’m normally one to preach all about “KNOW YOUR DOSE” but when I tried H this summer we didn’t have a scale but I had someone fairly experienced with H with me. That person created the doses. How much is a normal “dose” of BTH for someone who does not have any opiate tolerance? That might help me understand... if the dose needed is smaller than I think then that would help me realize why the price seems “high” to me. ",1544477657.0

All I can discern from Glassdoor is that it's an ""extensive"" urine test.  I do know that if I get the conditional offer, I can't exactly ask them for 5 days before taking the test without raising suspicion.  If I get an offer on Wednesday, I'd assume I need to test on Friday. I also know they use a chain like Quest or something, so I don't think I'd be observed.

I take 70 mg of Vicodin per day and have for a long time.  I'm female, 140 pounds.

I took Vicodin last at 9 p.m. Sunday.  I was thinking of taking kratom for a few days to help with WD, but I don't know if this test will include that, so I'd have to stop that in a day or two.

Or, I could get synthetic urine.  I do not have anyone I can ask for clean urine.  I looked at the drug test links on here, and it looks like there are some good options.

Has anyone done an extensive test and passed with synthetic?  I'm thinking like DOT test.

This is all sidestepping my philosophical objection to a job that tests for a desk jockey position, but that's my own issue.  Right now I'm temping and I need permanent to get insurance to get in pain management.

Leaving my trash laying around or accidentally dropping a empty has got me fucked up with the police, girl friends and family, so now to avoid any slip-ups I chew them up beyond recognition and spit them out the window, flush them down the toilet or just throw them in the trash. Well not any more.
   About a hour ago I was getting ready to crash and rationing out my dope for the next couple days. I figured tomorrow I will be at work so to make things easier I will just put 4 bags into one. My thought was that I would walk around the corner and use my little straw cut at a 45 to scoop up a nice bump and get right back to work before anyone noticed anything. These bags I am getting at the moment are super fat and after I combined the 4 I had a monster bag that looked amazing. After i flicked it to the bottom and compacted it, it was well past the first fold, if I had to guess I'd say it was between .5g and .6g. 
   After I finished my handiwork I went to my stash and grabbed another bag to do before relaxing and going to bed. I do, and when I finished I throw the stamp into the little pile of empties... which is right next to the monster bag. In one motion, not thinking, I sweep up *all* the bags on my dresser and chew them up for a minute and throw them in the trash. Feeling pretty good, I go outside for a smoke, though my joy is short lived. On my way to bed I glance at my dresser and to my horror my ration for tomorrow is no where to be found. That's when it hit me, i fucking chewed it up along with the trash. 
   These bags are a lot stronger then ones i usually get, my first though was that I just killed myself. If I were to snort 4 of these I would be pushing daisies for sure. Just one gets me well if I am sick and I nod pretty heavily after 2. Thankfully I just ruined my dope and didn't consume all of it, those little glassine bags are pretty tough. My next thought was that I am a fucking idiot, now I am 4 bags short and am going to be be sick sooner then anticipated. FML, I am praying that JJ makes something happen by the end of the week.

So today picked up some stuff with my friends and I shot it up as usual but it had this very scarily intense rush, I got this weird tingling burning sensation in my hands and feet but it wasnt pins and needles it was a very different feeling my friends and I all thought we were dying at first because we couldnt breathe and our hearts were racing and the whole ordeal lasted about a few seconds then we all calmed  down and were fine but after that we werent very high at all and you would think after a scary intense rush like that, that you would be in nod city but no. I really want to know if anyone has ever experienced this same rush before? Oh I should also add that I did a wash and I missed the shot but instantly got that same powerful rush which I wouldnt normally get a rush at all if I missed which is why I'm curious if anyone else has ever had something like this before or maybe knows what the cut was it kind of had a weird taste to it too my friend said it kinda almost had a bleach taste to it and he got super dizzy and confused.",1544424293.0

I had 2 surgeries to repair my left shoulder last January from a torn supraspinatus tendon, torn bicep tendon and tore my labrum in 3 places.

-vyvanse 70mg 1x daily

I'm not one much for speedballing (or whatever you call it If its with meth)  for several reasons, normal amphetamines completely mask the opiate high and I dont feel them, just the stim. If I'm doing the traditional eith coke, it's like the effects of both drugs come in waves, one minute I feel the warmth of the dope, and the next I'm feeling my heart pounding and shit, and that's not too comfortable. BUT HOLY FUCKING SHIT, METH AND HEROIN. Like my eyes were pinned as fuck and i was about to nod, and then my boy put the bubble in front of me and was like ""this shit is that fire, straight jet fuel, just hit it"" (this stuff was like strsight shards, no powder, and was almost completely transparent, crushed into fine white powder, and cracked back like instantly... I dont do meth a whole lot. But I know enough meth heads, to know what good meth should be like, at least I think) so I'm like, ok, let's do it, whatever, blow some meth clouds, and like two fucking big ass clouds in, i was FUCKING LIT. Like its really hard to describe how I felt, but it was amazing. I was hitting fire meth, but my pupils were still pinned as fuck, and like fuck, I wish I had more vocabulary to be able to describe how good it felt. Like so good.... and that's the scary part.

I got extreme hard veins to hit since I am born. And I am very scarred of needles which I am a bit more ok with now. I tried IV about 10 times and only hit a vein 3 times. Even nurses and doctors have it very hard to hit them. I once had a trainee nurse who hit me 20 times untill the doc said he will do it and he also needed 5 tries. I was child back then and since then I am scared of needles but I am ok with that now. I tried IV now 10 times and only hit 3 times ,2 times only a bit intothe vein the rest was missed. And once all in my veins and holy shit loved I the rush. Man its not describal. Anyways since I dont know any otger junkies whom could give me any advives I ghought I will ask here. And yes I know there is the sidebar post but I got veins which are called durectly translated running veins. As soon the needle goes through the skin the vein will roll tonthe left or right side. So this makes it much Harder too. Amd I can only hit in the hands and feets and now in the winter into the crrok of my elbowsLArms too since J only wear pullis, seater and jackets so no on one wil see my upper arms. Since everyone thinks I am clean right now ans I want that it stays that way maybe someone can help me out. I mean from that great stuff I even go to  nodcity by sniffing it and not too much but I boofed it on saturday and the rush was so extremly strong that Inat least want to know how IV feels with this dope.

I thought I'd stay that way for the rest of high school, go to college, get a job, get married, have kids, and just be a happy & successful person. Literally one year later, I started getting depressed over failed relationships with girls and turned to alcohol & xanax. I eventually found the girl who I thought was the solution to my depression halfway through my Junior year, but she just turned out to be the worst one of the bunch. I thought I'd get clean for her, and jump back onto my train to success. Nope. Not even two weeks into knowing her, she was clearly problematic, and I decided to keep using, eventually moving onto cocaine. Her and I were on and off all of 2018 up until the beginning of our Senior year. I have now dropped out of school and I am addicted to heroin. Heroin is the only drug that felt like an actual solution to my depression. I started fucking with this girl who got me into heroin, and I thought I was over the previous girl. A couple of days ago my family and friends have caught onto the fact that I am using heroin. I didn't know what to do, so I cut off the heroin girl and started detoxing at home. I genuinely thought I was over my previous girlfriend up until the point that I stopped using. Out of no where, she started haunting my thoughts again. I miss her. She was my everything. I don't know which I love more, heroin or Paige. While laying in bed, wanting to cut my legs off, I can't help but reminisce about the good times with Paige. Why did she have to leave me? Why couldn't we work it out? I won her back towards the end of July 2018, I thought I had it all figured out, I was 2 weeks clean off of all substances, now I'm a high school drop out junkie loser heroin user. I didn't realize that I was using heroin to numb the pain of the break up. Why am I like this? I threw so many opportunities out the window in the name of love for this girl. This girl who used me as a doormat. And now that my eyes are open to the existence of heroin, I feel like I just dug a deeper hole and I'll never overcome this.

She forged a letter stating I wanted my name removed from our lease, so I was forced out by the police. She took both of my dogs. She told my friends and family I emotionally abused her. I still love her and refuse to make her look like a bad person, so I apologized for my non-existent abusive actions. 

&#x200B;

A week after she left me, they found 3 tumors running down the middle of my brain. The tumors are noncancerous, but inoperable and growing. They also diagnosed me with multiple sclerosis.

&#x200B;

Yesterday after a month of planning, she was going to allow me to take the dogs to the park. I waited 6 hours at the park, she texted me saying she changed plans. She also told me she should've left me a long time ago and she stopped loving me about 7 months ago. 

&#x200B;

I accidentally texted her, ""call me."" so she blocked my number. I love someone who hates me, has destroyed my image, taken everything I love from me. I am slowly losing my health, my brain is slowly being pushed up against my skull.

The hop has me nodded hard.

Most of the afternoon, I guess, and when I wake up there’s a kink in my neck. A bad one. It is something I have had to deal with ever since I got a bad chiropractic adjustment. Not by a chiropractor though, and in retrospect, I should have known not to trust the guy as he’d ripped me off for a hundred dollars just a few weeks before when he sold me a half empty bottle of eyedrops as LSD. Anyway, my neck has had problems since, and the kid is standing over me pulling on my sleeve and asking for a cigarette. It’s annoying, but I pull the pack out of my pocket and toss it onto the coffee table. He grabs one out and lights it up. There’s more daylight out than I expected to see.

“Hey. What do you think about this?”

The kid poses in the Captain Morgan stance. His foot rests on the coffee table. The cigarette hangs from his lips and his face is ratcheted to the side like Popeye the Sailor man. He rolls up the leg of his jeans revealing what older generations might call a carbuncle, unsightly and excruciating in its appearance. It is the size of a tangerine and marbled in sickly swirls of infected yellow and a gangrenous purplish black interrupted by pockets of angry red bleeding.

“I think you need to go the hospital.”

“Yeah?”

“Yeah. Doesn’t it hurt?”

“What do you think?”

“Yeah. Looks painful as hell.” I say.

“It is. That’s why I’ve stayed away. I don’t need some idiot in a white coat stabbing at it and pressing on it and all that crap.”

“Yeah. But you need antibiotics, bro. Otherwise, you might be some idiot with his leg cut off or dead or worse. I promise. I’ll go with you. There’s a doc in the box not too far from here.”

“Really? You don’t think it’ll just absorb back into my body and go away?” He says ‘egg zorb’ instead of absorb.

“Yeah. Really. Let’s go, after we get out and get the medicine, though, I want you to take me to meet your sister in law or whatever she is. The stripper who buys a lot.”

“Sure, dude, whatever you want.”

35

The girl at the front desk requires 400 dollars before she’ll schedule us in.

I pay. It’s not much to me at this point, but the kid is sitting in the waiting room trying to make the remote work and having this half-hearted conversation with a bald guy about the Mariners. I sit across from them and the bald guy starts trying to tell jokes. The jokes aren’t funny.

It’s a problem Seattle has seemed to have ever since my dad died. People’s senses of humor just aren’t that good, and even though, I can’t honestly say I remember them ever being better than they are now, it really does seem like Seattle got less funny when my dad left us. Everyone in Seattle is always laughing at their own jokes. Whatever, though. It’s just how it is anymore. Makes me miss my dad today listening to this guy try to tell me a joke.

The kid is not paying attention to any of it, though. He’s just moving that remote through the air and now he’s standing on the chair. The remote’s still not working.

“Here. Let me try.” I say. The waiting room is small and to my left another man sits with his lower lip hanging off his face like a piece of busted rubber or something. Every bit of his gums and teeth is exposed. A strand of drool hangs from his mouth and drips onto his shirt, and the man is breathing hard. I can’t tell if he’s farted or if it’s just his breath that stinks so bad.

The bald man has been called back. He limps away. I get the remote and make it work on my first try. The kid throws his hands up.

“How’d you do that?”

“Wisdom comes with age, my friend.”

“Yeah, well, whatever. Let me try again.”

He snatches the remote from me and tries. It still doesn’t work.

“What’s your name anyway?” I ask.

“Charlie, bro. You know that.”

“Do I?”

“You should. We went to the same NA meeting for a year or something.”

“True. Guess I was in my own world. Thanks, though, for inviting me to that game.”

“No problem. Say you think I’m gonna be okay?” There is a genuine fear in his eyes.

“Yeah.”

“I don’t want to lose my leg.”

A fat nurse steps out into the lobby. She holds a clipboard and stares at it. “Charles Pulaski!”

“That’s me.” He stands up and turns back to me. “You coming?”

I stand up and walk with him to the exam room. It is cold and bathed in sterile white light. Scents of bleach and other astringent cleaners float in the air. He sits on the table, and after a minute, the doctor comes in.

The doctor is nice enough. He makes appropriate small talk and doesn’t sneer in disgust at the sight of the abscess on the kid’s leg but instead shows compassion and orders a shot of lidocaine and ten milligrams of diazepam for him. The doctor lances and drains the infection and walks out. Charlie cries in pain until he sleeps a moment on the table. After the nurse comes back with a prescription for amoxicillin, we walk out. The daylight drifts into night. I take him to fill it and back to my apartment where I hook him up with another shot to sleep it off. He calls his sister in law and sets up an appointment for me. I leave him sleeping on the couch.

36

I walk a while in the night and drizzle.

And eventually catch a bus that should get me close to the club where the girl works. Public transit is something I avoid anymore. It’s so slow. There’s no reason for me to, anyway. A 40-dollar cab ride or whatever it would be isn’t much for me these days. I’ve got rubber banded rolls of cash, so much that I don’t even know how much I actually have. Counting it is a chore at this point. So, I just keep it in a few shoeboxes in the crawl space in my hallway and limit counting it to times that I am going to reup or pay something or someone’s giving me a bundle for the dope I sell them. You have to count it sometimes. Other than that though, I carry a couple thousand or so in my pocket. It’s enough for what I need and everything I don’t.

On the bus a dark old man with black boogers matted into the hairs hanging from his nose and rancid malt liquor on his breath wraps his arm around me and pushes his nose into my neck and face and babbles warm words. His breath and brain are wet with liquor, and brown tobacco spit dribbles into his beard. It tickles and stinks. I laugh. He tells me that he’s from Cambodia, but other than that, he makes no sense. Maybe, he’s speaking Cambodian, but it sounds like gibberish. I want to be kind, but the smell is too much for me, so I push him off to move up a seat and turn around to hand him a twenty.

The scene reminds me of this stupid story I made up, once, about an angry old man who rides public transportation all day giving out very bad and unsolicited advice to everyone he meets, which is literally the most ridiculous and terrible storyline I could dream up. Most of my stories are that. Extremely bad jokes. Life is like a bad joke, and I get to thinking about the twenty bucks I just gave the Cambodian guy and how it won’t help him. Like Charlie. I gave him what he wanted. Heroin won’t actually help him, though. Not in the long run. There are others hurt by it. Beth comes to mind and the last time I saw her with Sal. He’d been beating her. She overdosed the next day at Tony’s place.

I think about her daughter. I think about myself, and it hurts. There is such turmoil in my chest, a pair of rats gnawing at a cage made of wire. I call Beth and look out the window. It rings. Maybe if I could transport myself in time and space to a graveyard on a hill over looking Los Angeles in the searing August heat of 1991, maybe that would fix it somehow. Although, I can’t figure out how it would, and I don’t know where in the hell a thought like that comes from. It feels right, though. It feels like it would make things better. That, or a lobotomy. Before, I can think much of my frontal lobe being snipped and scrambled or long needled syringes full of silicone going in behind the eyeball, the line rings again and Beth picks up.

“Hey.” Her voice bends in its despair.

“Sup? How’re ya doing?”

“Mmmm… you know. What about you?”

“Well.”

“Guess business’s good for you. Haven’t seen ya in a few weeks.”

“Yeah. I guess.”

“George found out what was going on. My mom and sister came and took my daughter from me, but it’s for the best. It just sucks.” Her voice breaks.

“Probably. I haven’t seen you with Sal.”

“Don’t get me started. It’s been bad, Randy. Real bad. I’m starting the suboxone program tomorrow.”

“Good. Good.” I hang on the line and don’t say anything.

She says, “Well……..,” looking for me to end the conversation or tell her I’m coming over or something.

“Beth?”

“Yeah, Randy?”

“I’m sorry. You know? I never meant for all of this to happen. It just sorta did.”

“Don’t. I’m grown up. I made my decisions. Not you. So keep it to yourself.”

“Wish it made me feel better.”

“Me too.” She stays quite a moment. “Me too, Randy. If I could just wake up from this. You know?” Sounds like tears are in her eyes.

“Yeah.”

“Yeah.”

“Well… I guess I’ll talk to you soon. Call me if you need anything. Really, Beth. Anything. I can help.”

Calling her hasn’t made me feel any better. She wouldn’t even let me apologize, but it’s hard to see how it would have fixed anything anyhow. The sadness dissipates by the time I get off the bus and walk the last few blocks up to the strip club. I call the kid’s ex-sister-in-law. She tells me to meet her behind the club and is standing next to the dumpster when I make the corner. She says,

“So, you’re the guy?” I hear her say it in person and over the phone.

I talk back into the phone and directly to her. “Yeah.”

We both laugh. She puts her phone into the side pocket of her coat and says,

“My car’s parked down the block. Walk with me.” She takes off down the sidewalk. Her stilettos click on the cement. Whatever perfume she’s wearing wafts back to me as I follow and parked out front of a dirty white house is a small Dodge Neon. We both get in. I sit shotgun. She sits behind the wheel.

“I’ve got 150 bucks.”

“Alright. Well usually I sell grams for 100…,” and before I can tell her that I’ll give her two for the 150 dollars, she says,

“Give me one now and let me go dance for an hour. I’ll get another one off of you lickety split, if you just wait. Go inside. Get a drink or a lap dance or something. It won’t take long. I promise.”

“Here.” I hand her a prebagged gram and get out with her. We walk back slowly. She doesn’t say anything until we get back to the club.

“K. Go inside and hang out for a bit. I’ll call you as soon as I’m ready.”

I walk in and get a Sprite from the bar. It’s cold and sweet and the plastic cup is wet in my hand. I meander around watching the few men with their bills and the girls dancing for them. Lynyrd Skynyrd plays. Pretty soon Charlie’s ex-sister-in-law makes an appearance on stage. She’s quite short. Almost some kind of dwarf or something and has a scar on her stomach like a jagged bolt of lightning. It’s not so easy to see in the dark, but it’s there. On the other end of the stage a taller girl with a big face and mouth and a thick pair of thoroughbred thighs dances awkwardly, and I start to feel embarrassed for them in a way. Not like I’m better than they are or anything like that, but I do. It just makes me embarrassed, so I look away from the stage and wander through a set of velvet curtains and a doorway to the back.

Reggaeton thumps over the speakers back here. Pink and green neon tubes glow along the walls and above our heads. In one corner a white light strobes next to a fat man with a headset, and in another corner a girl lap dances for a man in a chair. It’s hard for me to see from the distance. Other girls talk amongst themselves. A stripper with cigarette breath walks toward me asks me if I want a dance. She must be the oldest girl in the place. I say,

“Nah. I’m just looking around,” and shake the ice in my cup at her. I’m not sure why. Maybe, I’m subconsciously indicating my lack of interest in hers or anyone else’s services there, and even though I’m not interested--I’m really not--something over her shoulder catches my eye.

It’s a thin girl with a dark face and a straight blonde wig. She is looking directly at me. Her shoulders point down in collapsed posture. Her irises are black charcoal, and the white of those desperate eyes shine wet. They swell in sadness. I turn my focus back to the older one I just shook my drink at,

“What about her?” I point with my chin to the frail and delicate figure sulking behind her.

“Her?”

“Yeah. What’s her name?”

“Don’t know, honey. Why don’t you ask her? I think it’s her first night.”

The older stripper steps out of the way letting me get full view of the girl behind her. She stands there as sad as I thought she looked just a moment before. I ask her,

“You give lap dances?”

“Yeah.”

“For me?”

She nods at me chewing her fingernail. The girl turns and walks toward a chair across the room and turns to see me still standing there. It may sound cliché, but she really is like something from my dreams, and this whole scene something I’ve done before. I think it’s what they call Déjà vu. You know? I have this theory about it which is that the reason we find ourselves in situations which seems so familiar is that we’ve done all these things an infinite number of times into eternity past as the universe and time explode out of nothing to create everything and collapse back in on themselves and do it all over and over again into eternity. She moves slowly in this dreamy fog, an angel in the darkness. I recognize her. I know her. I snap out of it and follow her to a chair against the wall.",1544335532.0

Having no money means little hobbies. Years of being an addict has lead me to having very little non-addict friends. 

This has made sobriety boring. Go to work, come home, watch TV or play videos, go to bed, and then repeat.

When I'm using...that's a whole different lifestyle. It's just exciting. Hanging out with your addict friend and trying to cold cop at 2AM. Middling for someone and getting a big sack for it is better than a paycheck with overtime. Hanging out in trap houses meeting random ass people. Feeling the rush of a good pickup, knowing it's going to last you longer than any you've had this month. Snorting lines in a public bathroom with your buddy...

The lifestyle is more of a high than dope ever will be. Imagine using dope off the DNMs for a couple months and that's all you use. It would be BORING AS SHIT. ",1544335281.0

So I guess I just hate the effects of hydrocodone/oxycodone/fentanyl. 

Morphine and heroin are on the Nice List !

God. Only took like a week of use for me to feel a difference when I ran out. That bitch is sneaky ! 

Anyone else randomly buy a g of black and just assume you won't like it ? Anyone ? Am I the only complete moron here ? Probably. If I end up spiraling down into a hole of opiate addiction, at least I didn't start with a script.  I'm tired of that statistic being spouted off.  The scripts made me \*avoid\* heroin for the longest time because I get so ill on oxy, hydro and codeine. Fuckers I started by injecting heroin, I just went straight to end game. 

Thankfully, I have been more careful than the oral surgeon I had a decade ago who overdosed me with fentanyl and I had to be narcanned awake. Holy fuck that isn't fun, even if you're not addicted. I hadn't ever taken opiates and my first experience was an overdose with the misfortune of also having versed in the mix so I don't even remember the good part!

But yeah. Heroin is pretty fucking amazing. This ain't gonna end well... I'm officially out again and am resisting picking up. Wish me luck with making do with the kilo of kratom I've had forever. I wish you could smoke kratom....

Now I'm not here to lecture on saftey or anything but just be aware, when you snap a photo on one of these smartphones it also convienently saves a ton of info; everything from the exact GPS location of where it was taken, the device info and more.. that you may or may not want the world to know as It can essentially identify you without any effort as its embedded in the photo.

Just going through some of the more recent posts and pulled a few to see and sure enough people aren't always taking that step.

I have heard reddit may include this in the future by stripping the photo of exif but for now, just be aware.

You can always remove the exif data very easily with one of many free apps that strip it free of any info whatsoever and takes almost no effort, just one step prior to posting that could be of interest to those who'd rather keep that info to themselves.

I understand many do not care and I respect that and am not telling you what to do. I'm simply pointing this out to anyone who may not be aware that they can prevent this very easily and quite frankly I'm pretty sure many wouldn't want their personal information attatched to a drug post.
