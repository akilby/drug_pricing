8k0s8o,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8k0s8o/i_decided_to_have_some_black_coffee_with_white/,1,https://redd.it/8k0s8o,iambeingmonitored,"I decided to have some black coffee with white sugar for a few days, then added cream and almost made a terrible mistake.","I'll start by saying life has become almost unbearably difficult over the last year in every way possible.  Harder to cope with than when when my dog died in my arms at 6 years old.  More frightening and scarring then my dad drunkenly stating to my 8 year old self, “close that door now or I'll fucking kill you,” when I opened his bedroom door looking for him to help me one Saturday afternoon.  More physically damaging and draining than when I pissed off my football coach in 6th grade and he made me run 2 laps, then immediately play “push the line” with the largest guy on our team.  I would rather experience all those things daily for the next year than go through what I am right now.   

I started doing heroin roughly 7 months ago and have only ever injected it.  After the first month, I began adding cocaine to the shots for the crazy rush and euphoria it adds.  And just over this last month I tried it a few times with meth rather than cocaine, which gives it a much different rush and lots of talkative energy.  Over the course of 5 days with maybe 4 combined hours of very scattered naps throughout, I decided to try all 3 at once and in large amounts.  Over the first 3 days I go through 1\-2 grams of cocaine and heroin each day, then added the meth to the mix on the 3th day when a friend brought it over.  We went gambling around around 10pm and left a few hundred dollars poorer around 8am. It was right around here I realized the strange sounds I had been hearing throughout the night were actually whispers coming from my phone, it was just drowned out by the noise in the casino.  I tried calling my wife a few times, but didn't talk to her until afternoon.  During that time the whispers became somewhat clearer and I could even make out words and voices sometimes.  The voices also began coming from different areas of the room I was renting.  Sometimes the air vent, often where I had my laptop set up, and from near the toilet in the bathroom.  I searched the areas for signs of electronics and couldn't find anything, but things kept changing places and I swear I just saw the door close.  Is it possible someone has been fucking with me?  It was around 2pm or so on day 4 now and I finally spoke with my wife.  I casually mentioned what was going on and that I was a bit unsettled.  She said I was probably over stressed and too tired.  She doesn't like to talk much so our conversation was brief.  By now, if I was quiet enough, I could hear full phrases.  I would hear something like my brother in law whisper, “just look at that loser.  He throws out money he knows he doesn't have and still thinks he's cool?”  Or one of our old friends say, “Are you sure today is the best day?  Shouldn't we get more evidence and shit?”  I'm pretty fucking freaked out so I take another shot to calm down.  Didn't I have more than this?  Who has been fucking with my shit?  “Did you see that pathetic text he sent to Kate?  'I wish I could hug you' hahah.”  “Check this out!  He was just watching some vids he made with her and was jacking off!”  “WHO'S THERE?  I CAN HERE YOU!  WHERE ARE YOU!”  Kate wispers, “Hey, be quiet!  He heard us.”  I am scared shitless now.  I know this isn't right.  Kate is 100 mikes away and can't leave the city.  I'm fucking losing it.  I can't actually be insane though can I?  I'll call my wife.

After the 3rd dial and 2nd text, “Hey Kate?  I'm not trying to make things difficult for you or anything.  I know you have it rough right now too, but I'm pretty freaked out.  Will you talk for a bit?”  “Greg, you know it's late.  I'm tired.  Did you get any sleep?  Or did you see a doctor like we have talked about?”  ""I tried to sleep but couldn't.  And each PCP I am given either doesn't exist or can't take on new patients, the same as when we tried together.  I'll keep trying though.  Hey, you're not back in the city by some chance are you?  I'm not trying to be rude or anything I just\-” “What is it with you?  You freak out cause I don't answer immediately, now I'm skipping town?  To do what?  What do you think Greg?  Jesus, I've had enough, I'm going to bed.” Fuck...  I knew it would upset her but damn, couldn't she at least be civil when she answers a simple question?  Wait...  Did she even answer..?  

“He's so stupid.  I can't believe we actually stayed married this long.  Hurry this shit up.  Do we have everything we need?”  “KATE?!?  I THOUGHT YOU WERE OUT OF TOWN?  I CAN HEAR YOU, WTF IS GOING ON?”  “Just chill man, we have a chat going on and linked you in.  Look at the laptop!”  “ITS CLOSED!  WTF?!?”  “We can make the chat go through anything with speakers.  We've been recording you this whole time so your divorce will be fucking brutal!”  “I need this divorce to be over!  I can't wait to make it so you never see the kids, have to pay me every month, and I get that nice little SUV you're so happy with!  This is fucking great!  Keep shooting that shit in your arm!  HAHAHA”  “THIS IS FUCKED UP!  NO WAY IN HELL.  YOU'RE JUST FUCKING AROUND, RIGHT?  RIGHT?”  Call Kate's phone...  It's 6am, no answer.  She may still be asleep.  This isn't real, it can't be...  

“Hey sis, was he always this ugly?  I mean, ,if I were him I would have killed myself a long time ago!”  “I swear he was hotter before.  He had some muscle, more hair, and he actually had presence when around.  Now, haha, just look at him.  Nothing!”  “FUCK OFF”  “No, you fuck off.  We're coming there with the police right now to take you to fucking jail.  Hope you find a daddy there real quick!”  “FUCK THAT... I'LL JUST END IT NOW.  ILL SHOOT THIS WHOLE FUCKING GRAM AND BE DONE WITH ALL THIS SHIT!  I'LL PUT EVERYTHING I HAVE IN 1 FUCKING SHOT AND DONE!”  “Fucking do it already you little bitch!”  “He won't do it, hahaha.”  Everything is finally dissolved and I've just about filled the rig when I hear father in law whisper, extra quietly from outside the door, “You get that?  Now we can easily prove he's trying to kill himself too.  That will add more time once we revive him.  Attempted suicide, what an idiot.”  Oh fuck, they're here!  “Grandma, why is dad acting that way?  Whats wrong with him, will he be okay?”  “Oh honey, don't look right now, he's just feeling a little sick.  You may not see him much anymore.  He loved you though, I promise he did!” “But Grandma, we're almost there, can't we just go see him real fast?”   “No Baby Bear, we're too far away.  I'm sorry...”  What the fuck....  My kids are near by?  This is so fucked up, who would do that to their kids?  To their family?  I can't shoot this...  I need to find them.  There, that car looks like my mother in law's.  They've gotta be here!  I'll call the cops and explain everything!  I'll tell them about the speakers and computer, then they will have to arrest them and help me.  I need fucking help!  I don't want to fucking die!  I love my kids!       

So I called 911, cops arrived in about 10 minutes as I tried to explain everything over the phone.  I was handcuffed and questioned about everything in the middle of a hotel lawn as I cried and half the tenants watched.  I was taken to the hospital, given a few drugs and allowed to sleep, then spoke with  few psychiatrists and put in the back with 6 other people in small beds until morning.  I'm out now with a few phone numbers and doctor's names on paper and a band aid over my arm where the IV drip had been, about 2 inches from one of my favorite spots...  And apparently I threw out all my shit as I called the cops except enough on the baggie to make 1 small hit.  Guess it's time to call my d\-boy.

This is a true story...  I changes some details and left out some things that don't really matter.  But this happened.  To me.  Stay safe everyone.",1526525064.0

A stately pleasure-dome decree: 

Where Alph, the sacred river, ran 

Through caverns measureless to man 

   Down to a sunless sea. 

So twice five miles of fertile ground 

With walls and towers were girdled round; 

And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills, 

Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree; 

And here were forests ancient as the hills, 

Enfolding sunny spots of greenery. 


But oh! that deep romantic chasm which slanted 

Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover! 

A savage place! as holy and enchanted 

As e’er beneath a waning moon was haunted 

By woman wailing for her demon-lover! 

And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething, 

As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing, 

A mighty fountain momently was forced:

Amid whose swift half-intermitted burst 

Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail, 

Or chaffy grain beneath the thresher’s flail: 

And mid these dancing rocks at once and ever 

It flung up momently the sacred river. 

Five miles meandering with a mazy motion 

Through wood and dale the sacred river ran, 

Then reached the caverns measureless to man, 

And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean; 

And ’mid this tumult Kubla heard from far 

Ancestral voices prophesying war! 

   The shadow of the dome of pleasure 

   Floated midway on the waves; 

   Where was heard the mingled measure 

   From the fountain and the caves. 

It was a miracle of rare device, 

A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice! 


   A damsel with a dulcimer 

   In a vision once I saw: 

   It was an Abyssinian maid 

   And on her dulcimer she played, 

   Singing of Mount Abora. 

   Could I revive within me 

   Her symphony and song, 

   To such a deep delight ’twould win me,

That with music loud and long, 

I would build that dome in air, 

That sunny dome! those caves of ice! 

And all who heard should see them there,

And all should cry, Beware! Beware! 

His flashing eyes, his floating hair! 

Weave a circle round him thrice, 

And close your eyes with holy dread 

For he on honey-dew hath fed, 

And drunk the milk of Paradise.",1526520359.0

Well recently i've decided to start lowering my dose and eventually getting off of it.  I knew this would be coming soon so i've been careful to keep the doses low and not increase them. For a while i was actually getting a buzz from the sub (probably since it was a low enough dose to wear off before my next one). 

Anyways, I am now trying to dose less frequently and use smaller doses, but its harder than i thought it would be. i've tried all kinds of different strategies like taking 4mg every other day or taking 1.5mg a day.. but it seems like im getting to a point where i can't take any less than i normally do without getting WD symptoms in between doses.  Which sucks because i am currently trying to start a business and i feel really bad about being so dependent on something that doesnt get me high anymore and takes a lot of my time and money.

Does anyone have any advice? I hate the moody, mean, sweaty, achey person i become when my dose starts to wear off and i'm not even sure if ill be able to avoid that. Does anyone have any experience with low doses of sub? how bad are the cold turkey WDs?",1526512515.0

I finally got my ass into therapy for PTSD and depression and was prescribed Prozac (actually, the generic but whatever.) I was open with the doctor about drug use, what’s the point of all this if I’m going to lie, right? I asked about there being side effects of mixing it with dope or subs and she had to look it up to double check, but said the only thing was a very low risk of seratonin syndrome. 

I’ve heard of SSRIs killing a dope high, but while researching it also came across a few people claiming it potentiated it. Most said it made no difference. I couldn’t really care less about it boosting a high, but if I’m being realistic I’m not sure I’d take it faithfully if it made it so I can’t get off. I’m also worried about wreaking further havoc on my brain chemistry, but if it helped me through this low I’m open to it. 

Anyone have personal experience with this? I’m a daily user, trying to get back on subs but you know how that goes sometimes... I’m in a bout of fairly severe depression, which is something I’ve dealt with all my life even before drugs were in the picture. Any insight is appreciated.

I Just got out of my first time in rehab... And here's how I'm doing now.. Could use support.,"So I was off the wagon. I didn't use for a super long time. I was using opiates all together for about a year and shooting up for half that time, but I still couldn't quit the dope on my own.. I was waking up sick as fucking hell and I was also stealing from my family, wanting to quit that whole time but realizing I was still buying at least half a gram a day. 

While I was in rehab I hated it, I wanted to leave the whole time. Basically felt like I was in Christian school for a month. I was excited to go home. Then as soon as I get back I find out my mom and step dad are getting divorced after being together basically my whole life, I'm 22 BTW. They've been married like over 15 years not exactly sure the number. But anyways since I heard that I immediately, the day after getting out of rehab started shooting dope again for almost two weeks now.... I hate that I moved back to it so quickly. I have only been doing it like 3 days then stop for a few days then repeat so I don't risk dope sick too much.

I just wish I could stop this drug like I have with Adderall, Xanax, Crack, Molly all of which I haven't touched in months to over two years. But the dope is just different. If my mom finds out I'm using again. I'm probably going to be out on the streets. Just looking for support from this sub. I always loved you guys and gals in this sub. I'm just a mess lately.. I don't know what to do with my life. I sell drugs mildly, enough for me to support my habit, but work.. Like any job I've had I quit I just can't get over the fact of working, my mind won't mature to that level. I don't know.. I have a therapist now whom I like..

Personally, one of my favorite things about being around here is answering some of the questions. Generally speaking, I am pretty well-versed when it comes to opiate use and abuse. Been at it for nearly a decade, as both a pain patient and an addict. I come here for harm reduction, to answer some of the questions that have been answered a thousand times or that people I come here for harm reduction, to answer some of the questions that have been answered a thousand times or that people mock. I come here because over the two years I've been here, many names are familiar and I like to keep up with people. I come here because I have formed friendships with many of you, and because you guys understand me. I come here because no matter whether someone is wanting to share about banging their fire dope or talking about wanting to quit... Everyone here is supportive of what other people are here for. I come here to share my experiences. I come here because so many of you are rooting for my recovery and the support means a lot.

I usually get Sandoz Prefibin brand bupe but yesterday I filled and got sun pharmaceuticals Netherlands  bupenorphine HCL and the pills are white and have an 8 on one side and nothing on the other
They are also chalky and when taking the pill from the blister pack there’s powdery bits around and behind it which seems like a weird unprofessional thing to me as none of my others were messy like this.
There is also NO taste which I have never experienced ever. Usually even suboxone has a bitter taste. There’s nothing here. 

They burn like hell when dissolving and I don’t feel anything but cravings which I usually take my dose and have no issues all day. 
Really concerned because I live in England and local pharmacies have been busted dispensing fake stuff from India and etc recently in a crack down and it has me worried that it may be the case with these.
Weird that when I look them up they all have numbers on the back from sun pharm but mine do not. 

I plan on talking to the pharmacist next week and asking him to order the others for next time because it hurts me really bad as these dissolve. Just wondering if anyone else has any experience with these? 

I don’t want to risk my sobriety messing about. I’m having a hard time as I just had a death in my family and going through a transitional period of homelessness all the sudden with an infant child and nothing makes you want to give up more than that but I am working my ass off to change it but having mild withdraw symptoms (insomnia and stomach rumble, usually I am falling asleep in minutes, sometimes seconds from laying down and feel sleepy during the day) and intense cravings. 

If you have any experience with this brand let me know. 
Or if you can confirm that they should have numbers or if they are totally okay and I’m just crazy.

8juyt9,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8juyt9/need_reassurance/,11,https://redd.it/8juyt9,EqualResponsibility,Need Reassurance,"TL:DR; For people who jumped from Bupe to Kratom what wad their starting dose and how often did they need to refuse? I’m finding I have to redose every three hours. 

I’ve finally taken my last Buprenorphine dose over 37 hours ago. It was a 1mg sublingual split. I haven’t gone a day without my buprenorphine in three years. Today is a monumental day in that regards.

I’ve been using Kratom to stay off the withdrawals the best I can and wanted to share my experience and get some advice from others who went Subs/Bupe to Kratom. 

First, I’m ok not feeling 100% all the time. If I do then itll just make things worse when I’m finally off and PAWS sets in. 

Last night I had RLS. Which is pretty weird because I haven’t had that in a really long time. It makes me think Kratom is not able to stop all of the withdrawals that the Bupe is causing. Again, this is positive to me. Because it means I can slow roll my way through the withdrawals. 

I’ve put my kratom in pill form as it tends to work best for me. The issue I’m having is trying to understand if I’m taking enough of it. I tend to take only 5 caps which comes out to 4g of Kratom. When I was going through the RLS last night I had to take 7 caps (5.5g) then another 3 caps half an hour later to get the pain to stop. 

The Kratom seems to only last a solid 2.5 hours with at least half an hour start time. I am missing part of my bowels to Crohn’s so I suspect that’s part of it. 

Based on my calculations from yesterday it took around 32g of Kratom for me to barely make it through the day. Is this a lot? I’m reading people who take a SINGLE dose of 15g in the AM and then more six hours later. This seems insanely high to me.

I’m curious what doses others have used and the best tapering strategy, because the doses don’t seem to last that long I’m already on a short dosing cycle. Perhaps I need to be taking 10+ grams for it to last longer?

I just need encouragement. I’ve gotten off of Oxy twice and it was a walk in the park compared to this buprenorphine. Last time I stopped the buprenorphine I was in acute withdrawals for a week and had to start again and taper even lower.

The anxiety for me is the worst of everything. I survive, somehow, on three hours of sleep now. And because of the Crohn’s puking, nausea, and abdominal pain is my every day life. It’s the unbearable depression, crying, and skin crawling anxiety. 

I’d say the Kratom takes my withdrawals from a 7 down to a 3 if I take more when the anxiety hits. My symptoms manifest with Anxiety first, yawning and then sweats. The anxiety is my blood pressure from all the readings I’ve had done. It spikes to 160/100. 

Someone mentioned that if I took the Oxy for anxiety that this is leading to the anxiety being the worst symptom. I think they’re right as I would take the Oxy for anxiety. Anxiety of pain from my stomach. I’d be ok being on the Bupe for life if it wasn’t so expensive and didn’t have such horrible side effects. And id of been ok with being on pain killers if it wasn’t for the tolerance effect. 

Having gotten of pain meds twice and starting again due to a Crohn’s flair I have to do something different this time. I’m not sure what I’ll do, but the emotional dulling that buprenorphine causes is aweful. It makes sex aweful. It makes life awful unless you dose. It does help with pain and it completely removes the withdrawal. But what’s life without pain? I’ll never know.  ",1526477849.0

I have given up alcohol, because fent scares the shit out of me & im trying hard to get off it.

Basically I’m shit scared of over dosing.

So, I wait at least 2 hours after my last spray before I even go to sleep.

I never hit the nod, I never pass out. I can walk, my heart rate is fine, my o2 levels according to the apps on my phone are fine ..

The internet can’t tell me how long an overdose that brings on respitory  depression lasts or happens ... 

Can anyone tell me if they think I’m in danger?

25mg of fent on 20ml of water lasts me about 14 days, and that translates to about 115 MGS of oxy a day on the opioid conversion chart ...

Reality is I am opioid dependant; I was on 200mg a day when I slipped 2 discs in my back whilst in hospital ..

If I follow the vein it's sore on the inject site, about 2 inches above it, and the right side of the crook of my elbow was very sore earlier but is feeling better now. Applying pressure to the injection site creates a white spot that quickly fades back to brownish/redish/whatever. You can see in some of the pictures some redness of the skin below the Injection spot to the crook of the elbow. The injection site is only slightly raised, almost not noticeable actually.

I do believe it's nothing and I do believe it's healing. I've never had a reaction like this from a shot though and my mind likes to fuck with me so here I am. ",1526473540.0

However, my DOC's are Oxycodone, Fentanyl, and really anything synthetic that's not derived from poppy (they give me crazy stomach pains which I found out the hard way, many times lol). 

**So my question is:** Will oxycodone and fentanyl show up the same as hydrocodone, given they're synthetic?  I'm assuming they break down the same?  Surely their not able to test for each individual substance.

Now that school's over, I'm going to take a break from all these drugs. Meth isn't that hard to put down for me so I'm not worried about that. For benzo (clonazolam) taper, I'm at 3 doses of 0.25mg in morning, 0.125mg mid afternoon, and 0.125-0.25mg at night. Ezpz taper, gunna use clonazolam until I'm down to 2 doses of 0.125mg a day then jump off using phenibut, gabapentin, etc. Done it before, it's not so hard for me.

Now with opioid WDs; do I use bupe or kratom to taper? 1mg of snorted bupe makes my WDs go away, but they're only bad the day of peak. My professional junkie friend said bupe. But I'm opposed to the idea because the jump off is going to be so prolonges. Kratom, on the other hand, seems to offer a better alternative.

I've never tried it, never saw the point until now. I'm under the impression that while I'll have to dose more frequently, the jump off is not going to be nearly as bad or long. Also since doses are so controllable, I could theoretically lower my doses to the point where WDs would just be some runny tummy and mild discomfort, right?

**tl;dr - subs or kratom for taper then detox?**

So I have 1 8mg Subutex. I have2-4 8mg Subuxone. I also have 2 10mg Methadone pills. 

I am trying to acquire either A. More Subutex or B. More Methadone. I would be psyched to even have 1 more Subutex... I bought 5, and gave them to someone who I thought was my best friend. A few times I had mentioned that I only needed one from her and I'd be comfortable kicking. Naturally, she began to kick last weekend and I haven't heard a peep from her. She really broke my heart, honestly. The one person I thought I could trust, was the closest thing I had to a ride or die. Or so I thought. It's been one huge punch to the stomach with the the way I don't even exist to her anymore. She ghosted on me, and didn't even thank me for those Subutex. I took the bullet for her, and now I wound up living with the consequences. This feeling of eternal loneliness is too hard to live with, so I figure the best way to get over it is to get clean and, IDK, go from there.

Sorry for the sob story tangent. 

Anyways, with my 1 subutex, 2+ strips of Suboxone (easy to acquire) and very small amount of methadone, how would you recommend I go about a taper?

RN, my plan is to take that 1 subutex right when I start feeling iffy, and ride that out for as close to a day as i can, then start subbing with suboxone. I guess all I can do is taper with Suboxone until day 4-5? Or until I feel I don't need it? I don't think the 20mg methadone does me any good, really. I can't use them until I'm done taking any BUPE, and unless I have a substantial amount, I don't see it being a factor. Dying to get more subutex, and praying for a miracle, but unfortunately I don't see my guy coming through by weeks end seeing as I want to start withdrawing on Friday. 

Any tips or advice? Thanks guys. Wish me luck. Hope I start to feel better, physically but most importantly mentally. I haven't felt this down in an awfully long time. ",1526451735.0

I feel like I’ve given a lot of potentially disparaging advice about the crybabies who are too scared to hit the streets and get their hands dirty in order to find a plug. Ok that’s just me fucking around and being an asshole unnecessarily. I do have sympathy and genuinely know how shitty it is when it’s hard\-up: a dope\-desert out there, with no reliable plugs to be found. That shit sucks.

First, a little opi background on me: I’ve been using dope \(bth\) for over a decade. Shooting for 9 or so years, and cold\-copping in new cities for about that long as well. It first started when I moved to the Pacific NW at 19 and decided to scope out the city to relapse on dope after a period of being \(mostly\) clean from opiates \(this was all to my detriment, of course\). I started my hunt downtown, talking to homeless dudes, when I more or less met the guy who would be my plug for the next few months \(until I got strung out and kicked out of my apartment\). This was after only an hour or so of searching. Pretty good luck, I'd say.

Eventually, I honed that ""luck"" into the method I've used ever since: go downtown, to a shelter or to a sketchy part of town, hit the streets and start talking to people. I’ve lived in and copped in various new and unfamiliar cities, in many states, even in different countries. I was ripped off a few times in the early days or in desperate times where my guard was down, but have pretty well learned how to navigate the streets as well as the people out hustling on ‘em.

This was my line of thinking at least, as I was flying to a city I’ve never been before to visit my brother. I was curious if I still had it in me, and decided to put it to the test \(for science, of course\). Totally unfamiliar city. No contacts, no connects, no rig. Now, I’m trying to stay clean but fucked up and used H the day before I flew out after a couple weeks of staying away. So I figured I’d only take the little cash I had on me \($30\) to see what I could hustle up, just to take the day\-after shitty feeling away.

Thus, my adventure began. I hit the streets, pretty well starting downtown, hopping on a random bus, hoping it would end up in a more sketchy area. I was originally planning on copping near downtown, but I could see that the areas were getting sketchier and sketchier the further I rode out of the city, so I just stuck with it for probably 20 minutes or so. I eventually hopped off in a place that screamed sketchy/crime/dope. My heroin\-senses were certainly tingling.

And… I was officially on the hunt. I started talking to the dudes on the street who looked hard\-up, worse for wear, potentially homeless. From my experience, many of these folks are either users with connects or at least have a line on someone who does. Almost immediately, I ran into a dude who said he would help me score. He took me down a back street behind some businesses, past a shitty church and a fairly run\-down neighborhood. Eventually, the street led to the little cut into the forest. He took me down a path littered with trash and random shit, to a VERY sketchy little tweaker lair in the forest. It was pretty creepy. Definitely wouldn’t recommend this for beginners, but I wasn’t too worried. I’ve been unwillingly dragged to similar places in the past, and knew such folks are usually harmless, all things considered. I also got a pretty good read on the guy who was leading me around, and I didn’t get the vibe that he was trying to run me around or hustle me out of my money. He actually had a little black on him as well as some pills. It wasn’t much or enough to do anything for me, but I figured he at least had some connections. He split the dope with his buddy down in the forest dwelling who gave him some speed. They took fucking FOREVER \(it seemed\) mixing up their little goofball shot and I was getting inpatient, as the main dude he was looking for wasn’t even down in the tweaker lair. They were sitting on a grimy mattress mixing their shots and smoking speed. They offered me a few hits and a cigarette, which I took. Felt a little better after that. I was carrying a book, and actually sparked a conversation and started talking politics with another guy who was down there tweaking, doing speed. Overall, it wasn’t as creepy or as uncomfortable as it could of been. The hospitality could’ve been a lot worse, to be certain.

Eventually, we took off to a spot where he supposedly knew a guy who had a plug. We left the forest tweaker lair, back to the street. It took a minute for us to walk over to this guy’s little haunt, a Mexican restaurant back up the same road and across the highway entrance/intersection. On the way, my guide somehow accidentally squirted his little goofball shot out into his pocket. He wasn’t too happy about that. We got to the restaurant and ran into another guy who was also looking for H. He said he could score, but I definitely got a bad vibe from this guy and had that gut feeling he was going to try and hustle me out of the little money I had. Always trust your gut, people. So I decided against going with him and to wait it out instead. Only a few minutes later this little Mexican dude on a bike \(the guy who supposedly had the plug\) rolled up and said he’d hook me up, that he actually had it on him.

Immediately, I felt relief. It had probably only been 2 maybe 3 hours since I had started out. I didn’t realize how anxious and inpatient and, well, SICK I was getting. I hadn't noticed the ache in my legs, the sweat beading down my back. Not until I felt that sweet, immediate relief when he said that he could help me out and had the shit on him. He went to the bathroom in the restaurant and made up the bag of dope. Now, I know better than to get my hopes up in situations like this. So I tried to keep them in check, while planning my next move if this fell guy fell through or was bullshitting me. He came back and handed me the bag. It was a little small, especially compared to the amounts/prices I’m used to. But he also threw in a new rig as I didn’t have one and was probably unlikely to find one out there. So I figured it was a fair enough deal.

I immediately went into the bathroom of the Mexican restaurant, cooked up the shit, fixed a shot and blasted off. It was actually good dope, and just enough to get me well/feeling pretty good. Afterwards, I hiked back up the street and hopped on the bus, kinda fucked up and nodding, and proceeded to get lost downtown for the next two and a half hours. And that’s it folks! The rest of my stay there was me feeling shitty and depressed, babysitting children, and getting back on my suboxone regiment. Thanks for reading, and good luck with all your future cold\-copping endeavors. Happy hustlin’!",1526447319.0

In Britain, some doctors are allowed to prescribe medical heroin to frequent opioid users.  This has been true for decades.

The freeze-dried form of medical heroin used in Britain is expensive.  It costs the government perhaps £14,500 per medical-heroin patient per year.  [(Source.)](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/heroin-prescription-diamorphine_uk_57fd2f6ee4b0430f66f67894)

Still, medical-heroin treatment (also called ""heroin-assisted treatment"") is worth the money.  It reduces the incidence of crime, unemployment, abscess, HIV, disease, overdose, and death.  [(Source.)](https://www.spectator.co.uk/2015/05/the-case-for-prescription-heroin/)

Currently, about 30 doctors in Britain prescribe medical heroin.  [(Source.)](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-115352/Heroin-NHS.html)  But most doctors don't.  Methadone and Suboxone are much more common.

# Medical heroin elsewhere

Medical-heroin programs have also been established in Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Denmark, Belgium, and Luxembourg.  [(Source.)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid_use_disorder#Heroin-assisted_treatment)

# In the US

In America, frequent opioid users can get methadone or Suboxone from a doctor.

Unfortunately, Americans can't yet obtain medical heroin.  It would be legal to launch a medical-heroin pilot project in the US, but nobody has yet done so.  [(Source.)](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/treating-heroin-addiction-with-heroin-what-you-need-to-know-w494829)

There are various abuse-deterrent morphine-based opioid products available in the US, such as MorphaBond ER, Arymo ER, and Embeda.  Morphine is a useful drug for treating frequent opioid users who don't do well on methadone or Suboxone.

I took tramadol 260mg yesterday and ~420mg today. Slept only for 6 hours past 2 days. Need advice. 

How do I know that a seizure is coming? I remember 15min ago I was drifting off to sleep suddenly my vision was going blurry and all of my muscles were tingling. My calves are a bit tingly right now too. Is it because of lack of sleep, am I exaggerating? 

I would also add that I am alone in my house, what the worst that can happen during a seizure? I never had one.

Thanks.

I'm fine, no seizures. Thank you everyone for help and big shoutout for /u/iSweaterGodSeth that walked me thru it all on DM, to calm me down, I was just anxious as hell. Peace",1526432697.0

At the time I was crystal clear that is all I could provide, that I could pay that debt but I wouldn't be in a position to loan more than that. I told him this up front so that he'd have the option not to loan me a bun's worth but in his words, ""I'm more comfortable sending you to the ATM than sending Derrick \(the middle\)."" Without me getting the option to borrow a bun's worth of dope in addition to two free bags, I would not have biked to the ATM for Cliff with his card at 4AM last week. 

So tomorrow he might just text me around the time I'm expected to get paid to ensure he gets the money I owe him. Then what? He will most certainly ask if I plan on buying anything \(dope\) on that day. It's tempting, and it is a temptation that has consistently resulted in me buying myself dope in the past. I've clamped down due to experience and shear necessity to have money left for other things after pay day. After paying back a debt, if I buy myself dope on a day that Cliff is broke, I'm likely to buy one additional bun to loan him. Since I don't plan on buying myself dope, I don't see a reason to loan him money for dope.

Now, although I won't do that, I will likely throw Cliff a sub or two while stocking up. Nothing more, only what I'm willing and able to lose even if he does end up paying me back at some point. Now, other than that... if I did want to buy dope, I would go directly to the middle and bypass Cliff. If he begs me to borrow money for dope because he can't buy any for at least a week, offering a sub or two will be a generous and cost effective alternative. If he does not want to accept, that's his loss. He will end up getting neither subs or dope. If he accepts, he will have made the wise decision to have something to dose for four days. If he takes a full sub and ends up suddently empty once more, that's on him. I will have done my due diligence. 

He might've learned a lesson from that time when he waited at my doorstep for two hours in the snow. Well not so much him, I learned a lesson from that scenario. Tomorrow if confronted, I may end up outright pointing out ways he's full of shit. My father isn't home tomorrow, if he comes knocking I can be as loud as I want in expressing myself. His first hope will be that I pay back my debt to him and choose to buy dope. The second hope will be that I offer to loan him money for dope even if I don't get any for myself. His last hope, which will likely not be on his mind but offered by me will be the subs. I have no obligation, but it looks good on me when he says ""I always help you out"" when asking for a favor. Now I will have a recent scenario where I did help out withotu the resentment that comes with spending more than $20 to help out a friend who always pays back cash debts in the form of goods that cost them less. 

With all that being said, I have a job interview at the end of the week. I've been taking subs for nearly a week now and have been tapering down my dosage. If I get the job, a drug test is almost completely inevitable. There is a chance that the test won't screen for bupe, but I still want to get my dose down so I have a fighting chance at diluting my void in effort to reduce the detectability of drug metabolites.  

Now here's an alternate scenario. I buy dope tomorrow, by whatever means.... ideally bypassing Cliff because I don't want to spend more than what I spending for my own wants and needs. After I finish a bun or two buns of dope.. I will have reset myself. I will then have to go back on suboxone as the dope\-sickness sets in. That will likely be around 4mg. If on the other hand, I don't consume dope before my job interview or on pay day... I will be on a dose that is below 2mg. That means that if I get a drug test next week, I'll have a much better chance of passing it if it even tries to detect bupe. Being that my financial well being and future is affected by the outcome of this job interview and the subsequent drug test, there is no level of talk, promises or convincing that can get me to cave in to temptation. Not tomorrow. The day after the job interview? It'll be tempting and I'll likely try to convince myself by saying ""heroin can only be detected within 72 hours of use, I can flush that out no problem."" However, the subsequent dose of buprenorphine if screened for will surely be detectable. 

So bottom line; tomorrow we might get a Cliff post involving me getting paid, Cliff begging me to give him more money in addition to what I owe him for a bun of dope. I'll then offer him a couple of subs because I'm not callous. He'll likely be disappointed if he accepts. I once wrote post about how Cliff says he can and wants to get subs but his actions indicate the opposite. A post of mine tried to explore this situation, one of the comments aptly stated ""Because the same way some guys think with their dick and get really fucking stupid around chicks, some junkies think with their nose/arm/asshole and are incredibly stupid when it comes to short\-term vs long\-term rewards.""

Some months after [writing this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8jiz12/whats_the_stupidest_things_youve_done_to_try_to/), I told Cliff about one of the other comments. I didn't tell him the post was about him, but I did quote the comment where someone amusingly said, ""\[...\] Shit tastes like fucking failure and disappointment."" 

Well, I rephrased and said to him that someone said ""subs taste like disappointment."" Cliff immediately bursted out laughing. It was obvious that such a statement resonated with him. Thus it's no surprise when I've offered to buy subs early in our pay cycles twice in the past three weeks and each time Cliff expressed disinterest in doing so. The second time he indicated interest but by the time I he really needed them he only hadf $20 in his account due to spending more money on dope while waiting for subs to become available and possibly food because his mom kindof get's on his ass when she hasn't eaten more than two meals in two days. 

So now, past couple of days he asked for a half a sub. On one day I gave him and 4mg and pretended to have just 2 left. When he asked again yesterday I said I had none and gave him the sort of BS he would give me if the tables were turned. I've given him opportunities to stock up and so I don't feel that I should cut into my own supply a week later. What kind of message does that send? It says he can continue not to think about the future, that he can just wait til last minute and get relief in the form of subs when all other options are exhausted. I've seldom had such luck when I was in his position, so I don't see why I should reward his his lack of foresight \-\- his choice not to be prepared. ",1526416115.0

At 4am I was pretty goddamn high, still getting higher but couldn't stay awake and passed out. I've read that Codeine peaks about a hour after you take it, food shouldn't have delayed it 6hrs right? I've read that some people metabolize much more codeine into morphine than others could that have something to do with it? ",1526413552.0

It's amazing but you have to let it dry for a minute. It's almost like stale playdough (it's not as malleable as playdough). 

I'm wondering what the extra moisture could be from? Does anyone know? 

When it hasn't been moist it would normally just be ROCK hard. Like you would need to smash it up like a pill. I can't tell if it smells real vinegary because I can't smell, but it used to when it was this wet. 

EDIT: I just read on another forum that the moisture is added so it can be repressed into a rock. I'm not sure how true that is because it doesn't rock up very well when it's moist, but maybe when it dries out it does.It's more like chunks.

Of course it was found when I was just helping out a kid and wasn't looking.  

There is an abandoned gas station off one of the main streets heading towards the city that has decent pavement and a few spots to skate. I'm old now, like old enough I still find it odd to use emojis, but still like to push around on my board do small flips and drops. Yesterday a couple of kids where there shredding pretty hard. We talked a little, they asked if I wanted to hit their vape pen (oh my god technology is awesome!) and discussed obscure music.  There is a decent gap that (we'll call him:) Slim kept charging at full speed over and over but was an inch or so from clearing.  So what eventually happens? He eats shit,  HARD.  Bleeding from his chin, arm tore up, pants shredded he is fucking hurting too bad to skate and mentions he's got like a 3 mile walk home.

 ""You want a ride, homie?""  ""Seriously?  Hell yes.  Thank you thank you thank you!""  He grabs his shit and we hop in my truck to leave.  As he is directing me to his house, it becomes obvious he lives in the cut.  ""Hey man, thanks again for the ride.  You want a little weed or something for the gas?"" 💡""Yeah, I'd appreciate that.  But you know what I really would like?  Some blues or some dog food!""  ""Shit, really?  You don't look like a junkie, but yeah, my big bro sells that shit. Let me grab him""

After a few minutes of sitting in the driveway, out walks a well dressed, no face tats kids thats probably about 25 years old.  ""You good?"" Yea, I'm good.  ""Here (throws me a little baggie). Thanks for looking out for the kid.  Take my number, call me if you need more.""  Alright.

I drive home, open up the baggie.  There's almost a half a g in here!  And it's good too.  I've got pretty spoiled off of DNM, but this stuff is pretty close in comparison. So I hit him up again this morning just to complete the connection.  Boom! I now have a local plug!

According to science all anecdotal reports, I should've felt NOTHING. Especially with the .2 shot I did.

But no, I got higher than I've been in 5 years. If I broke thru, I have no idea how.

Naltrexone DOES lower opiate tolerance, which explains why I was puking my brains out but it doesn't explain why it didn't block the shot.

I also did some on Sunday... 3 days after shot #3 and while I didn't feel anything super strong, I did get a nice mood boost, and a little of the warm tingles.

There's also something else worth considering ... Since I did some on that Monday, and my shot was on Thursday, I should've popped for dope at the doctor, but my UA was 100% clean. From the results I saw, it doesnt look like they test for fent or its analogues... In fact the only opiate on the list is morphine.

So maybe I got a super potent fent analogue that cuts through naltrexone like butter?

I started taking oxycodone 10s about 3 years ago for a then undiagnosed chronic pain disorder. I was on the oxy's for several months before I started upping my dose on my own, and pretty soon I was in a full blown addiction, taking 40 mgs in the morning, afternoon, and before bed. This lasted for about 8 months. About 3 months into my addiction I noticed I didn't feel the ""high"" from the pills unless I stayed still, mainly my legs. I would have to sit down on the couch, or lay in bed keeping my lower half completely still to get the high, and if I moved, it was gone. This made it very difficult to do anything with my life. I got dehydrated because I wouldn't get up to get a glass of water. I barely left my bedroom for the next 5 months because then I wasn't able to get high. I could take the pills to keep the withdrawal symptoms at bay if I had to go out, but I felt virtually nothing other than relief from withdrawals. Later when my doctor found out I was getting pills on the side from other sources he was really understanding about my situation, even though he almost lost his medical license, and he got me into a fantastic pain rehabilitation program at Mayo Clinic. I got off the pills, got a diagnosis for my chronic pain disorder, and have spent the past 2 years completely drug free! I didn't get an answer for my question though, even at the prestigious Mayo Clinic. I recently had a particularly bad case of appendicitis and spent a few days in the hospital recovering and needed to be on pain meds when I got home, even though I really didn't want to. Once again I noticed I didn't feel the effects unless I stayed completely still from the waist down! I took the pills for a day at home, but I didn't want to get trapped in that same cycle again so I threw them out and stuck with OTC meds, which was brutal.

She still considers herself an addict and does not want to try opiates again, but (of course) misses how productive and at ease she felt when she first started doing opiates and eventually 10 or so years of heroin.

I don’t know if the productive feeling is common, but I understand what she means, as the dozen or so times I’ve taken Norco recreationally I turned into a cleaning machine. I would stay up for 48 hours, wash my car, rearrange my room, etc. My anxiety would disappear and I would perform better at work, was more outgoing, it was great. Based on what she’s told me, it sounds like she reacts in a similar (slightly uncommon) way as I do. 

Are there any other less addictive treatments which could possibly trigger any of the same feelings of relief and productivity, even on a much smaller scale? She feels her 7 years of therapy was a waste and depression is beginning to take it’s toll. She’s been on anti-depressants and anti-anxiety meds and doesn’t believe either helped her much. I would be open to learning about any forms of alternate treatment, i believe mushrooms have helped me in certain similar aspects of my own life, so we’ve discussed psychedelics/ayahuasca treatments.

I got into drugs early, tried drugd in the US with 15 (moved to Germany tho and jst went back for a year back then ). Having lived in a conservative german upper middle class community, it for real broke my mind. This trip changed my life.

I used to be very introverted. Also played lotsa guitar, getting into that atm again which is cool :) but yea I always wanted more than that ""golden cage "". So i broke out. With weed first which was enough to get banned from their ugly community. I saw behind these nice faces the first time as they harassed my brother. 
I got deeper, H w 17, got clean went to uni relapse 2 year addiction Iv all that xcept jail. Thats the next step honestly.

My dads a covert narc. Hes old and conservative and as Jordan Peterson (dnt wanna tlk bout him or politics pls) said, theres nothing worse than a sick person living w a highly conscientous person. He always emotionally mistreated all of us, which led me to drugs s lil but boo hoo. 

I moved out in March. Went back to uni and worked out a plan to get the minimal legible support from my parents w some restrictions tho. Started to repair bridges altho most have been burned. In my mind I made a lot of hurdles even tho im on MMT and occasionally use. Phenibut semi regularly, wanna dose that down tho. Dont use it erryday. Someimes valium; sometimes H if its good, usually weed and social drinking. Im in college soo yea I get drunk a lil and bang chicks hahsh. Way better than sitting in a room alone w a needle in my arm. Whenever i stray I visualize myself back to Mexico. Or my bloody flat that was a shithole.

I mean theres a lot i still fck up. Esp behaviourlly. The time in the scene left scars esp the violence i endured and saw. Guess i got a light version of ptsd. Nt to belittle real survivors but I got lucky too. Not just once. I actually pray to santa muerte. Youre the first I tell. Its not to feel global or sum shit, ik im german. But she represents all thats about me somehow. And I grew up Catholic even tho I reject the institution and am mostly agnostic. But we. If we have a saint ill take my chances. 

Things are looking up. I show up. Got a interview friday to supplement my resources . Mmt here is a bitch, i live in East Germany atm. They treat u like criminal low lifes and are always astonished when I show will to improve. Thankfully I always prepare now. Never used to. But almost dying changed me. Yall know that? Its rly weird.i thought id be stuck all my life.

I will be in berlin visiting friends nxt week, theres a slim chance  might ve able to finish my BA there. Got more friends there than here, also a real high achieving one, I study media so that would fit and their programs are like wooooorlds better. Most progressive. I must say I aint a fan of the ""new left"" but I really appreciate liberalism (libertarianism for u guys ) here.

I got hep c. Like they found anti bodys, did a pcl-r and my counts like 40. They say ths hella low and theres a 50/50 chance it might go away. No symptoms or higher liver ""werte "" idk lol tho. And i take gym supps which would support that. 

Anyone know bout that?

Also any tricks u got for sex on opiates/mmt for guys lol

So I've had a tough few days in my capacity as a storage facility manager. It's eviction season, and we had 6 tenants who hadn't paid in a year or were over $1,000.00 in arrears who got the axe. (we have extremely low standards) One of these tenants is a couple, one of which is a mentally challenged compulsive hoarder and the other a crippling alcoholic with wet-brain who haven't ever paid us a dime. They had 4 units floor to ceiling packed to the door full of literal tons of crap soaked through with the smell of liquor sweat, cheap cigarettes, and piss, and they've never paid us a dime in 11 months. It's taken me and one other guy 3 days to clear them out and we still haven't finished. They've ignored every invoice and call, as well as their final notice with a clearly stated eviction day (two days ago). Today they show up because they heard through the grapevine (2,000 people in town) that we were putting all their stuff on the side of the road with a free sign and promptly drove over to try and somehow make us feel like the bad guys for floating them 11 months ($2950.00). We simply told them again and again as they tried to explain all the ways this was wrong, how they were totally going to not only start paying but somehow pay off the $3,000 they already owe, and how I was a bad man for being nice to them up until I had to evict them. They've been outside trying to load a car with stuff for over 5 hours and they haven't even filled one load. Dude took two hours to tie a soiled mattress on the roof of the SUV. Last I checked he was still at it.

Anyhow, this brings me to my question:

In the evictions, as I was tossing a box in the dump, I found a 90 count bottle of 300mg gabapentin, 30 or so promethazine, and what appears to be at least 100 Mexican Flexerils. I've had maybe four fingers of Jameson out the bottle and a half mg of etizolam. IF I were to throw some gaba in to the mix, would that be too strong of a combo? I'm talking 300-600mg, but I've never taken gabapentin before. I've got a good handle on what my body can take downers-wise, but is gaba some rare beast that I should be ever so careful with? I'm nowhere near the danger zone right now, and I know I could easily handle a Flexeril or another half milligram of etizolam, but my bodies tolerance to gabapentin isn't something I feel comfortable gauging yet.

So, pill heads and downer fans, how does gabapentin stack up as an alcohol and benzo potentiator?",1526370249.0

It's not dank but I picked it off the branch myself. Learned a bit but unfortunately \(or maybe very fortunately\) I also learned that it's not feasible to do the same with poppies. This is not to say it cannot be done. Although Monticello may have contributed to his bankrupcy, Thomas Jefferson had the good sesne to grow a bunch of poppies around his property. They were eventually destroyed and seized but that was a couple of centuries after Jefferon was last able to use them. 

So maybe if one was to plant poppies on a larger plantation scale, they could have enough poppies to fuel a habit but such an endeavor would likely be as legally troublesoome as it is challenging. 

You best believe I ain't showing this or mentioning this to Cliff. I only bring this up because I've given him two opportunities to buy subs in the past three weeks and each time decide to postpone his purchase. Postponed only to be asking me for a sub a week later, a day after he fan out of dope and dope money. He used beg me for a smoke\-up on days when he has no dope or pills. He has said in recent time how he misses it and would like to smoke a blunt. I'm not stopping him from offering me money for it. In the past I never wanted anyone's money if I could smoke with them but eventually I had to choose between dope or pot. One thing the dope game has done for me, it greatly reduced my daily intake of pot. Good for my lungs on those weeks when I'm broke and only have subs to keep me well. 

Nonetheless, I've learned from this whole experience how valuable marijana can be when in withdrawal or recovery. It isn't just the lesser of two evils, it has true therapeutic properties.

Oh and, I've read more than one post where the OP says ""smoking weed makes me feel guilty about my drug use"" or ""does anyone else feel guilty about doing dope when they smoke weed?"" I don't know what it is, there are times where I can really relate to that. Other times it serves as a potentiator without the guilt and I am accustomed to feeling both ways at different times. When I'm not on hardcore opiates and smoking weed at night at home or out in good company, I feel fine.",1526362195.0

One dumb thing I do sometimes is I'll rinse cottons over and over (up to ten times), I'll rinse like ten cottons together, that have already been rinsed more than once. Just to feel some relief.

I've sat at a couple different gas stations for about a half hour each one and had my non-addict girlfriend ask people for money because we ""ran out of gas"", in an hour she made 50$ and got a full tank of gas.

Terrible for you, I know. A junkies gonna do what a junkies gonna do though, ya know. Unfortunately in my area, the dope fucking sucks and it’s way easier to find the 30s than anything else. I have a dude I work with who charges outrageous prices for them since he’s an addict as well and just does it so he can cop extra when I throw in- but I digress. 

The dope around here is so terrible that it either gives you a strange sedation with barely any euphoria, no legs, and no rush. I don’t even know what kind of shit it is half the time tbh. I’d prefer it to be fent most of the time just so I could get a goddamn rush. Fuck. 

Either way, one particular evening I was craving some good old H and I said fuck it. I’m gonna try and see if I get lucky (which I rarely do) and cop some shit that is hopefully real fucking heroin for once. 

Jesus Christ. 

When I say I have no idea what the fuck I put into my body that night, I mean it. It looked strange at first, but I thought it was possibly just weak dope mixed with fent. It was white, crystal powder almost, with brown specs throughout and even darker chunks of stuff that didn’t dissolve in the spoon whatsoever. I shot a small amount and of course didn’t get a rush, but felt a small bit of relief from the sickness I felt all day. I said fuck it and doubled down. Big mistake. I instantly started to feel like I was tripping- but more or less dissociating. It was weird as hell. This shit had a slight opiate tinge to it; with extreme overtones of uncomfortable dissociative mind wobbles. I felt like I was going insane.  

I got my shit together, threw the stuff away and decided to never call that dude again. Next day I hit my other plug. SAME FUCKING “DOPE”

DUDE HOW? 
 I mean at this point I understand it must be a strange batch of stuff that was going around to the local D-boys but god damn. I have never been so disappointed when I saw what I just bought. Okay- I’ve been way more disappointed- but knowing you just wasted money and have been essentially burned always sucks. 

At this point I decided to say fuck this state- and head back north to where I know I can cold cop in one of the biggest open air markets in the country- and score some delicious, real fucking dope in my old city. Without giving away too much and hoping the mods won’t delete this, I drove about 1,100 miles to my old city and picked up a bundle of some good ol’ glassine tickets. My favorite. Legit shit. Finally. 

Actually

Nope. 

Deceived again. As soon as I open up the bag I immediately noticed that the shit was pure fucking white. I tasted it and holy fuck was it strong. So I knew it wasn’t coke, and it was actually H, probably more so fent at this point. To be safe I sprinkled some out for a tester shot. And when I say sprinkle , I mean I put a few pieces of dust on the spoon. And amount that would seem laughable to even the most opiate naive person on the planet. But I’ve overdosed before and I’m overly cautious. 

Thank god I am. That shit had me nodding almost instantly. Another small shot and I mean SMALL, had me puking my brains out. I was dysphoric now, and it has turned on me from being so strong. 

I thought to myself - what the fuck? Did some one try to kill me? Did I look like a fucking outsider and was this meant to put me down so after all the junkies in the spot raided my pockets, they would find the bags I had and run to that corner boy for the “good shit”? I was so confused. There was no way even the most hardcore junkie around could shoot a bag of this and survive. And I’m not a lightweight either. I’ve been in the game putting spikes in my arms for the better half of a decade, and for years before that I was dabbling with pills. 

How the fuck am I going to do this? I thought to myself and had an idea. If I can dilute this enough in some of my 0 mg Nicotine E-juice, and drip it onto my Mod, I may be able to just vape this incredibly strong death fent-dope wacky bag. 

Well. It worked. To my surprise really well. One bag would last me all day and I had a shit ton of them. What would normally last 2 - 3 days max, ended lasting me a long fuckng time. 

If you’re ever scared to shoot some dope that might potentially kill you- dilute it in your vape juice and hit that shit like a fucking hipster sucking on a hookah. Safe nodding y’all.

I should be vomiting, sweating and everything else. However, I have felt no withdrawal symptoms. The reason for my use of codeine is that it was initially prescribed as a medication for my IBS, and it has, thus far, solved these problems. The doctor believes that I use codeine because I'm addicted to it. I believe I want to use it to combat my symptoms. 

Given that I've stopped taking codeine completely for the last four days (mainly to prove that I'm not mentally/physically addicted) and I have had no side effects, am I addicted or not?

Had countless psychologist and counseling sessions, used subs to quit, and went to rehab for 5 months, but I still don’t think I’m an addict to all drugs. I hate weed (makes me paranoid and uncomfortable), hate stimulants unless it’s modafinil (for my narcolepsy), but I still use lyrica for nerve pain (related to an OD on fent and alcohol) and benzo’s for anxiety. I’ve drank a few times since I’ve been back from rehab and popped 2 bars over the course of 5 months and haven’t once had that feeling of “man I could do this everyday/once or twice a month and I’ll be safe.” I personally don’t feel like I’m a full blown addict that if I touch anything I’m back to the opiates but everyone around me thinks that. Of course my life has improved so so so much since I went to rehab but I think I only used drugs to cover up my crippling depression (which I don’t have problems with anymore).

Like, I did 1 bar and hung out with my friends and the next day went to school and my job with no issues like thinking about the next time I’ll do it. My mom thinks that since I won’t admit to being an addict and I said that if I use something, I use something but I won’t waste my money buying it or chasing it, that I’m still struggling with addiction but that isn’t the case. I feel perfectly fine and I’m happy now. Of course I have bad days just like any other person but I don’t use drugs to cope with anything anymore. What are your guy’s opinions? Should I do what I feel is ok and what I can control or should I just give it up 100%? Like to give an example of how I work, I literally drank in halfway just to get kicked out but since I was 17, they couldn’t just put me on the streets so my mom had to come get me. After I got home, I was 100% sober for a month until I went to play Xbox at my friends house and while he was drinking 4-5 shots, I just did 2 because I just wanted to feel looser, not fucked up, whereas before I would’ve just taken the bottle and started chugging. I take Phenibut to deal with social anxiety and I take clonazolam for the times I’m really anxious or on the verge of a panic attack but that’s it. I take 3 different controlled meds and I haven’t abused them at all even though I have the bottles whenever I want. Just let me know what I should think about. I’m sorry for this hella long rant, I just figured that this community would know more about it than anything. Thank you ",1526318990.0

I went from one hundred mg of methadone to forty in just 6 weeks it was tough. But I wanted to make the switch instead of quitting any maintenance all together because I'm a 13 year heroin addict and don't trust myself.

Methadone even at one hundred mg gave me cravings and effected my body SO bad, I hated it, especially going to the clinic everyday, and I wasn't getting my take home because I love drugs and had one clean urine due to fake urine in two years.

My last shot was 12 hours ago, my doc said he would start me at 1-2mg to see how I react to subs. I'm wondering if I just swallow the tablet so it doesn't work and I can still get my thirty day script, whatever the dose may be, because I don't want WDs. What do you all think, and yes my plan is to be on subs , maybe a chip here and there but I need to cool for a minute and get a job and get back into the groove of life for a minute.

I am a former opiate abuser, and as of recently \- a methylphenidate user \(as prescribed\). I became aware of this chemical many years ago. Its certainly a controversial one as we all now. It seems like it does one of two things \- Makes you feel high/weird/fucked/different OR it makes you feel like its addressing your brains chemical imbalance perfectly and restoring your mental health back to 100&#37; like a miracle. Right now, for me I am experiencing the latter. I have been on antidepressants for 6 years now \- I have never been depressed but I have an anxiety problem where I get sent into minor panic attacks \(sweaty palms, feeling in the chest, racing heart\) from just remembering certain shitty things about life that are out my control. certain worries that every human can potentially have, and for everyone there are probably thousands. I realize anxiety is normal and helpful but definitely not the extent people like me feel it.

Finally, after 6 years of maxing out doses on different serotonin based drugs \- my doctor decided that we will try stimulant therapy. I told him right off the bat, I have NEVER had an issue focussing or getting distracted or with hyperactivity. He said thats ok, we will try it anyway. And low and behold I feel calm, less than zero anxiety if thats possible, and like a literal void has been filled.

But now I am very curious. As I said, I am an ex abuser of opiates, a long time ago and It did not last long whatsoever. I have never slammed before. I definitely feel like my body as recovered from that period. What are the effects of attempting to abuse opiates while on a dose of Ritalin? Or say a dose of adderall/vyvanse or other stims? I imagine there are different effects of this combination depending on how the stimulant by itself makes the person feel. Some people feel just perfect and normal and not speedy or high on stims, because its what the brain is missing. Other folks not needing that particular chemical action in their brain necessarily will feel high and speedy. Im very curious to know what the typical feeling of this combination is and maybe a chemical explanation.",1526311637.0

Names / Details Changed.

I was 19 when I started trapping. I had a good paying job with benefits, my own car and own apartment i'd sell out of. I was already a heavy user of meth, adderall and anything I could get my hands on to keep me up during work. (due to long nights trying to keep things running smoothly.) 

I was a functioning drug user and definitely a contribution to society. Now to be honest, I didnt even need to trap. I couldnt stand the cycle of going to work , coming home, and repeat. It made me feel empty, despite having everything I could want at a young age It didnt make me happy. 

        Obviously the only correct thing to do was to sell drugs, right? I surrounded myself with meaningless people and I still felt alone. It was horrid, there wasnt anyone I could relate to other than on the topic of drugs. It slowly drove me crazy. Weed, coke, china, dabs and various other shit was coming in and out through the doors of this 1 bedroom apartment. Eventually it did catch up with us.

There was eyes on the apartment and we were already two steps ahead and cleared as much as we could, out. ( Mainly our pets )
Shortly after a warrant was obtained and they stormed the apartment only to find a steaming shit left infront of the front door, various blunt wraps, and just shit we didnt bother taking.

The apartment was not in my name so I was lucky on that. But shit I got bored of trapping with people, so I kinda let them run themselves and left. This path was not the one I was to walk. Although I did do my own sales here and there , it was rare and only large quantities. I had to do this drop to this younger cat, Id grow to call him my disciple, cos he was snowballin quickly, always increasing the amount he would ask for. 

 I get a call from him asking for a half ounce, and that he didnt have a ride and his mom was asleep. I laughed reminiscing about my own teenage years and came over. I decided to stay and chat for a little to the  4 younger folk and just talked shit, called their music gay and went about my business.

 I didnt have a place to go to because i was in the process of looking for another apartment, so I stayed at a motel 6 of course. ( What better place to be a piece of shit?)"" Being a motel 6 , there was like 6 other dealers on the same floor, and I just sold to them and kept low key.  Nothin really interesting happens at all tbh. 
I had like 10 puppies and 2 dogs I had to take care of so I had a bunch of puppers running around the room and shit but yea.

 Couple nights pass and I get a call from home boy again, and wind up at a Dennys. Now at this point im fucking lit. Its probably best to say this as well, I'm not a social person. I dont particularly enjoy it, Ive been told im too straightforward and blunt, sometimes coming off rude. I just honestly miss the social ques.
 ( A guy tried to rob me with a knife , when I got out of county. He pulled it out and he said ""give me money"" and I just said "" no thanks I have a knife at home already "" and walked away.) 

 But anyways, I was there honestly just for the pancakes and to do this drop. But this waitress caught my eye. She was the same homegirl that was with my young disciple the previous night. Now let me tell you, she was a cutie. Dark hair up in a pony tail, yellow Denny's shirt which she rocked incredibly. Black tight pants and combat-look-a-like boots. My idea of flirting was asking for free pancakes and I stepped on her shoe. I eventually waited for her to get off and the rest is history.

Time skip to a couple months. This girl is amazing, she's gorgeous, loving, kind and caring. Now she may have flaws but we're all human are we not? We love , we hurt, we sin. Its only natural. But man I loved this girl despite that. We clicked instantly and the love was apparent. We moved into our own place, with our three boys. Poobie, Shadow, and Gustav.  ( Two cats and a dog) It was great, but I forgot to mention I also sold china white. Before we moved to our apartment we stayed with her parents. That is where she first tried it.
That would mark the start of a regret I will hold for the rest of my life.

Our use started to increase and increase and before we knew it we were pawning shit we had for dope. Our guns, our drugs, our TVs. Everything slowly went missing, and we justified it with our sickness. It definitely put a strain on our relationship and I slowly became the 2nd lover, while the drug became her first lover. But anyways I had this homie named ""God Given"" in English who just happened to be the plug. He was cool as fuck but always on xanax and smoking H, and you can barely understand him. He'd mumble hardcore. This nigga was roughly like 5,6 hispanic ( Italian lool inside joke) and trapped hardcore and bought stupid shit.

So anyways We were good friends, but business is business. Instead of coming back with profit , Id have to ask him for fronts on H. He was cool with it cos he already knew Im good for it. This would go on and each time we would return we had less and less money and became more and more sicker. The entire time this is going on im still going to work, 6am-5pm working as a mechanic. I had to come in on a sunday going through bad withdrawals and I straight up left. I was then fired and lost our form of income. 

We honestly didnt care as much as we should of, in retrospect. Now even though our relationship was going through some shit due to my insecurities and flaws, my partner was still there with me. She was my support, she'd literally pick me up when I couldnt go on anymore. I really cant stop talking highly of her. She drove me to become a better man and lover. But anyways skip to the holidays like Xmas and turkey day. We had like 3 months left in the apartment, and we literally went car hopping and to various doors trying to pick up packages. Not my proudest moment but we were obviously retarded.

I got the bright idea of scoping out places in our apartments to rob. I would look under each mat to see if some unlucky fellow left a key. After a few days of walking around with my dog, I found a few. But there was one in particular that still makes my heart beat. We waited for the person to leave and we broke it through the front. We took our time found shitty coke, a dildo etc. My girl told me to hurry but I honestly thought we were good. Then we hear a fucking door knob turn. I locked both locks before hand to avoid this but it still spooked.We were cornered they police were on the way and all we could do was just dip. I opened the door and tackled this bitch so hard youd think i was a right tackle. We ran and ran and ran, but when i looked behind me, my girl was no where to be seen.

I fucking kept running and took a sharp left away to break line of sight, and went up stairs to my apartment. Hoping honeybun would be there, but she wasnt. I started freaking out and then she bursts into the door. She says "" I dropped the fucking key when we ran !"" refering to our car key. Now within minutes the entire complex is flooded with cops. I was like fuuuck. Its a newer key where its basically push to start ( caddy ) Im curious as to what were gonna do. Were withdrawing have no key to start our car and were basically sitting ducks.

Some time passes and we hear a fuckin knock on the door. I literally hide because my girl is gorgeous and like can sweet talk anyone. So she opens the door and its a police officer with our key. We try to play it off but honestly cant but he just asks a few questions and leaves.But not before taking a picture of my girl's shaved head ( underneath on the back) Now we have transportation and move all the stolen items to my plugs house.

The next few months, we lost our home, our car, and  were homeless. We lived with my mother for a short time and got kicked out and honestly we were falling apart. It was no ones fault entirely, we both had our part to play but regardless it broke my heart. I had to move in with my dad and he let me use his car to be mobile. I wasnt allowed to see Britt but I didnt care. But When i did go to see her she was  distant. She would ignore my calls, ignore my texts, call me annoying. I was nothing more than a puppy being kicked everytime it tries to run up and kiss you. She started doing Ice heavy and  Heroin too.  I didnt know what went on in that period as I was not allowed in the apartment. So you can imagine it broke my fucking heart man. Still does. It was one night I was helping her move her shit to her apartment with her brother ( the stupid fucker who ruined her more) and I asked if I could come over too. Thats when I realized my dog that was in the back seat was missing. I looked everywhere and my girl didnt care enough she asked me to drop her off and go. So I did and continued my search for my best friend. I couldnt find him even after hours so i parked and waited till sunrise to look. During that time I kept texting and calling asking her to please spend time with me or just see me. Not one reply. I sat there and cried, and cried until i couldnt no more. Then just when you think I couldnt of get more fucked I see 4 police cars coming towards me. Some dick reported me for suspicious activity. I tried to call her to tell her to come get me and she ignored me. I was then searched and charged with felony possession and shit.

I sat in the back of the car completely and utterly destroyed. I lost my girl my dog, and now my freedom for a bit.",1526298151.0

I'll IV dilaudid or smoke/sniff H. Earlier tonight I smoked about a 10 bag and apparently went from my couch to the floor. My roommate said I was facedown in a fetal position and I was snoring. He said my breathing was irregular, but I *was* breathing and I did have a pulse. But I wasn't responding to him. He slapped me and poured some water on my head.

This has never happened to me before. The H i've always gotten was pure, my guy never sold me shit cut with fent. I wonder if this bag may have been hot. I think I was just being impulsive and smoked too much in a short period of time, and blacked out. 

From my understanding, overdosing from smoking straight heroin isn't very common, but I know it can happen.

i'm pretty shook right now about this though. I'm usually very careful about my dosages, but I was impulsive and did too much too quick after a stressful day @ work.",1526278769.0

Then my phone does the familiar buzz buzz, I look and its the guy telling me that the latest order has come in.  The trouble is that I often pay ahead of time so im “owed” the shipment so I say to myself that this time will be the last.  Then I fall into the same vicious cycle and find myself saying, one more week then im done… Too many times..

Im tired of the battle, im tired of the debt I’ve put myself in (over $20k)… dear god thats the first time I’ve written that out and its crazy to see that number being up on the screen.  I feel so ashamed.. so embarrased… 

I have it really good…great family… amazing family.. a good job..  a house that I own… all without graduating college.. and yet I still
Medicate myself because for whatever reason I still find no joy in all I have.. 

Tonight im on hour 48 ( just passed a few moments ago) and my phone again has the familiar buzz buzz.. I know that by this time tomorrow night… hell even tomorrow afternoon I could be rid of the DTs and feel normal again…. Really really struggling to not take that drive out and pickup

My cravings ebb and flow, one moment Im like “ I can totally win, I don’t need that shit..”  The next its “ I should go and get what I need then I can taper” … yea right… how many times I’ve lied to myself saying I would control my dosage and taper down so I could kick this once and formal only to open that bottle and feed myself a handful just to feel the rush again… just one dose to feel it then you’ll control it from here on out… but I don’t… and before I know it, all of them are gone. And again I stick myself in this horrid destructive cycle. 

Browsing the stories of people kicking habits much worse than mine is helpful for sure but I can’t help but battle with myself.  

I still haven’t responded to the guy but IDK if i’m strong enough to say no.

As the title says, I was on opiates (mainly heroin) for around 3 years. After meeting a wonderful, beautiful girl, I decided enough was enough and went to a doctor(outpatient) to start Suboxone maintanance. I think just taking subs for a few days to get off a multiple year habit is a bit naive, your likely to still want your DOC after, I mean it's only been a few days. So I did the opposite, and spent around 2 years going about this process, which included therapy, it was expensive but quite worth it now that I look back. I started at 8 mg (sub) a day in the beginning and worked my way down to just sections of a point, not a discernible amount by any means. Yes, going down was tough but i had Gabapentin in the beginning of the taper and both Gabapentin and Clonidine in the end. WHAT A COMBO FOR WITHDRAWAL, highly recommended. So, it's been 3 weeks since my very last Suboxone dose and I truly feel like myself again. I have all this energy that I haven't had in years. I feel sharp again, quick witted, and man my sex drive is through the fucking roof. While your on subs you feel like it's not really having any discernible effect on you, you feel... normal. BUT, once off them you realize that the suboxone was indeed dragging you down, keeping you a bit low, and severely emotionally distant. I'm full of love and emotion, so much so that I don't know what to do with it all. It's. Just. Great. I was really worried throughout this entire process that I'd never be the same person I was prior to my addiction, but 3 weeks in and I know that I'll be back. I'm not all the way there yet, but I couldn't feel better given the situation. 12 days ago I took a (required) UA with my doctor. There was no longer any suboxone in my system. I'm finally through this nightmare and our the other side to speak about it.

I was wondering if anyone had a different outlook on that decision, and didn't deeply regret it.

I find myself at this very crossroads right now; I have been using heroin for 5 years now (4 years smoking on the west coast, 1 year sniffing on the east coast), and i've reached a point where I can barely even get well sniffing. My nose is totally fucked, so my choice is pretty much get sober or switch to IV, and I know I'm not ready to get sober. I've been looking for tar, but haven't been able to find any in my small east coast city. I never even considered switching to IV when I was smoking tar, I found the fix satisfiying from day 1 to the end of the 4 years, but unfortunately nasal use just doesn't do it for me, and has a host of unpleasant complications. I am not looking for people to help me justify switching to IV, as I know its not a justifiable decision to make. Its practically suicide. But as we all know addiction defies logic.

So yea, irregardless of my situation, I was just wondering if there was anyone out there who didn't regret ""graduating"" to IV opiates.",1526249350.0

I know about 6 other users whom I smoke with and buy with. They all say that my reaction is very unusual and they all get concerned for me. The weird part is I always thought this was a normal side effect of heroin. Let me describe what happens. 

The first few times I tried smoking H, I was find. I didn't even think it tasted that bad. 

Then one day it all started tasting HORRIBLE and still does to this day. Very very strong sour rotten vinegar/BBQ. The taste would start to gag me, and one time I threw up cause of it. 

But ever since then, when I take the first hit of the day, I will IMMEDIATELY have to throw up, and I will throw up a lot, to the point of stomach acid. In a weird sick way, I loved the relief feeling once the puking was over, so it never stopped me from using. 

Sometimes (usually if ive already smoked that day) I won't puke at all, and I'll be fine. Then sometimes I'll be nodding out and I start to get this feeling, and I can recognize it every time now. I start to feel very very hot, and start sweating and I feel light headed and very disassociated, and it builds up for a few minutes until I begin violently puking until my stomach is empty, and then I'm perfectly fine, back to nodding out and enjoying my high. 

It sucks when I spend the last of my money on H, so I'm on an empty stomach and the hits make me violently dry heave, which is very painful. 

Does anybody know what's going on? Or if this is normal? 


Edit: the only reason this concerns me is because the pattern of vomiting is starting to cause me to lose a lot of weight and become malnourished. ",1526230894.0

Thankfully I’m alive, but I want to know if what I experienced was an overdose or am I trippen?","Before I begin, I don’t need anyone adding any negative comments because I already knew the risks I took before hand but I’m just trying to understand exactly what happened. 


Connect said he has “China White” and right off the bat I’m skeptical, especially since he’s charging much more. After trying the product, I’m under the impression that it’s powdered fentanyl because the intensity feels like its medical grade and I live on the west coast (Cali). First I smoked it on foil and it tasted exactly like the OG Oxy’s 80mg. After getting a feel for how potent this stuff is, I decided to try IVing it. 


On my 2nd shot of the day, I made sure to only try about half of the shot to see if it was too much and of course I thought it wasn’t. I only injected 75% of it and woke up on the floor with imprints on my skin from other objects on the floor. I was out for about 20 minutes when I finally came to. I’m not entirely sure if I overdosed but I woke up without any high and with some ld the dope leftover. I would like everyone’s opinion if I had a close call or if I am overthing it!


Since this stuff has a short half life, is potent af, tastes like oxy and more, it’s safe to assume it’s fentanyl. This person won’t admit that and says it’s China, as he sells it for 10 bucks a point. I’m used to paying 50 a G of some bomb black tar. I keep hearing that fentanyl is cheaper than heroin, if that’s the case then how much is he paying or picking this stuff up for ? ",1526212500.0

No sense in buying dope on pay day, the day before the job interview unless it can enhance my job interviewing abilities. Even then, I have my subs and they'll keep me more than well through the experience and task. If anything, I may need to taper down from the current 3mg to 0mg in preparation for a piss based drug test.

Last two times I did a drug test for a job, I smoked good weed the days prior and drank enough water to nearly piss clear. Once I drank an energy drink to add color back to the piss, I was in the clear for the urine test.

The most recent drug test was under different circumstances, let's just say the person who administered the test didn't know that it was a red flag to have clear urine. It was my own piss but it was too clear by professional standards.

If I don't get the job, I won't need to get a drug screening and even if I do get the job, I may not have to submit for a screening immediately. What do state and city angencies do, if you are offered work in a library, or do IT support in some random civil service agency... \*\*How many panels are on the drug test?\*\*

In short, I know a 5 panel test will not screen for buprenorphine, nor will a 10 panel. 11 panels and up on the other hand... will. Now of course if I was seeking a job in law enforcement, there would a be higher expectation of a more rigurous test.

In short, I don't thing there's any way to be certain.

Regardless, if I get the job I embark on a new chapter of my life. One which likely involves waking up at 5 fucking AM to commute but one which also allows me to command a pay rate that is multiples better than my current one. I could imaine it now... my uncle hounding me about geting a wife and me having every right to say fuck off. Maybe eventually accrue that ""fuck you"" money that John Goodman talks about... but I'm getting ahead of myself.

Basics, basics, basics..... My brother once called me to eat at a diner with him. It took a coupel of weeks to arrange it on a day when we both were free. I thought he was going to talk about Trek and Star Wars with me. I thought that I was going to be able to tell him about an amazing literay universe that I stumbled upon. I thought it was going to be a bonding experience, a long overdue one.

Instead, it was my brother telling me that I'll never finish college.. to not bother considering that further, telling me that I need to find a real job, that I should be more like him because he has a wife and she was a great help when mother passed on. Motherfucker, your broad \(with all due respect to present company of women\) is not a fucking shoulder to cry on.. she is not your crutch. Many unlucky men have discovered this through a rude awakening.

Anyway, he went on to say ""you need to look forward to a three hour commute."" What does he mean? He's strongly suggesting that I apply for a job in a neighboring state where public transportation options are available but a pain in an ass to say the least. Maybe if I had a car, but I really never wanted one too badly.

Bottom line, he went as far as suggesting an Aamazon job that looked like it was right up my alley.. except Amazon loves borrowing your life blood. Twelve hour shifts with the expectation you'll pick up over time as they need you to. The higher paying Amazon job did not look like a job which would enable me to have free time.... I do work on other projects, I do have aspirations that my other work will become more successful.

Rewind, the day I met up with my brother. It was a Sunday afternoon around 1PM. I had just spent the night taking key hits from the supply of dope that was supposed to be saved for Sunday. I still had something left to take the edge off in the morning before meeting my brother but by the time I was in the middle of eating my waffles I was getting the yawns. We all know, once the yawns start \-\- it's over. Well, not completely but it is the begining of the end.

So I'm falling into this psychologically vulnerable state and being pressed, ""what do you do, who do you hang out with on your free time?"" Do you think I'm going to mention, ""oh, I hang out with Clifford a lot, smoke pot, watch movies, jerk around on the internet... maybe work on a little code and blogging. Somtimes I put lots of time into writting at r/opi..."" I most certainly did not reference my time with Clifford. That mofo is a red flag and rightfully so.

He also went on to say that my obsession with my turtles was fucking weird. Alright, that's it.. fuck off. Those are my fucking brats and they're good kids, except when they're being asshole escape artists and even then that's at their own peril. It was a year later he did get word about my dope slinging and attempted to stage an intervention that failed because I cried foul about the informant and said shit like ""he literally does crack."" Went for broke, played my cards and reflected as I continued to use therafter.

I think I'll give this getting clean thing a chance even if I don't get the job.. then again I do imagine that, if I didn't get the job, I would spend some money on dope. Even then, I'll play it up. I can ensure that Cliff is not my double\-middle if I did decice to cop after the interview. Still, I can get subs.. subs work to keep me maintained and if I really need to be able to take subs while takign a drug test, my best hope and best bet is to get them leigimately from a real doctor. Then, even if a drug test screens for bupe, I'll be in the clear.

So one way this palys out, I'll see a doctor, get subs... tell Cliff I'm clean or use teh subs to get free pills from Cliff. No wait, no.... he'll know I'm sitting on an ""unlimited"" supply..... that'll just open me up to bullshit again. Otherwise, I keep takign un\-prescribed subs while hoping they don't come up in a pre\-employment drug screening and I continue to attempt my own self\-recovery plan.

\*\*Point is...\*\* If I get the though the interview, I'll have an easy track to a decent job that is not in the private sector. As the guy in Ghostbusters once said, ""in the private sector, they expect results.""

I'm a MULTI-TIME world champion LOSER to the false fart.  

Vivid memories of the sharts that should have been that still linger in my mind:  (the farts that actually turned out to be sharts, I have been prevale during my years of being an addict.  The number of sharts opiate withdrawals have caused is completely ASSinine.  

Whenever I would feel the desire to release a freedom fart of happiness during detox, I would be greeted by the vengeful and cruel mistress known as **False Fart Prophet.** She only  shows up to hand out punishment.  The punishment is usually of the runny, warm, rankness, all going down your leg variety.  She would always say ""There has to be some kind of payment for the euphoria we provide.""

In my dreams there's a world full of only safe farts, and no more defication defeats.  But then the fairy tale ends, my eyes adjust to the light, then the rumble in my stomach brings me back to reality 

I wonder, is this finally a rumble from a faithful fart or another unwanted shart?

I woke up from the anesthesia after back/spine surgery screaming and freaking out.  
I felt lost, confused, disoriented, felt like i couldn't breathe, nobody around me was familiar...it was honestly petrifying. Ill admit, i was more scared at that moment than i think i have ever been in my whole life.  
Since then, i've woken up at home at least once a night in the same state of mind..panicked, lost, confused, terrified.

Anyway. I've had a lot if BS happen so far this year... A major surgery and several hospitalizations where I was kept on lots of morphine and fent. I never disclosed my prior heroin addiction. I didn't want judgement, I have a high pain tolerance and the little shit doesn't help and I saw how they treated the active junkie in the room across the hall. So yeah, that's how it started. 

I've been on 10/325s for nearly 3 months now and my doctor has started the weaning process; despite still being in legitimate pain.

I’m a 21 year old woman with my whole future ahead of me and I’m even on track to graduate with my BS in 3 years and I’m not letting that slip away because of a stupid mistake.

I love you all and you can PM me regardless of your situation at literally anytime with no judgement. We’ve all been there. Just be please be safe and responsible if you’re going to use. And do not, for whatever reason, share or reuse your own needles if all possible. My brother gave himself Hepatitis from using the same dirty needles over and over again. 

Once again, I love you all and please please be safe out there. You are gambling with your life and losing if you continue to use, but that’s completely up to you. I have faith in you all regardless if you’re ready to quit at all, even if you’re not or simply slightly considering it. 

I will be here regardless 24/7. I swear confidentiality on my life. ",1526133093.0

I had written a couple significant paragraphs going into a thank you for all of those who have helped keep me alive and disease free through the various needle exchanges in the number of cities I have lived in within the United States. 

I have been a chronic pain paitient for the better part of last decade, so my insurance has covered the vast majority of my opiate habit. The only things I would have to pay for were things like LSD, E \(when I could find quality stuff, and for whatever reason it's always come from the gay scene through friends I worked with\), Ketamine, DMT but that is just about all that I've been into other than opiates, benzos and Adderall \(that I rarely take, strictly for safety reasons for long motorcycle or car trips\) which I was scripted for all three. My opiates were cut off and my benzos were dramatically reduced, but I still have my Adderall script as has happened to most chronic pain paitients in the United States. I got clean for almost a year through a damn near cold turkey method. And as I have heard others say, each and every time you go through that tramatic experience, a little \(or not so little\) part of your soul disappears. I will never do that again. After being so proud of myself for getting clean, I had to go through major oral surgery from a combination of not taking care of my teeth in general, and the damage the pills did to my teeth, I had to have major work done. This was incredibly extensive and painful and led back to using opiates, except this time I found heroin. And I was quite disappointed that it didn't even hold a candle to the Opana I was used to taking for years. 

Anyway, here is the question.....

I can no longer find veins on my feet, arms or hands. I know that I've seen a diagram on here before that identified the best places to inject, could someone link me to this? Or list some strategies or helping you veins come to the surface? Also could someone describe the proper technique for shooting in the neck. I'm probably leaving out some questions. Feel free to add anything I may have left out, or any criticisms of my methods. I am planning on taking Ibogaine within the next couple months with a Flood dose and then do booster dose whenever I feel the cravings coming on. I really want to losen the grip of the monkey on my back. Any advise would be appreciated. I am tired of getting high, aside from psychedelics which I see as beneficial to my mental health as long as I keep it's use within reason.

Thanks again for any input.",1526128452.0

Tl/Dr: fucking read it or don't.

I DO NOT ADVISE ANY OF YOU TO DO ANYTHING I EVER POST. I HAVE BEEN FOOLISH FOR MOST OF MY LIFE. BEING FOOLISH IS NO EXCUSE.
DO NOT GET HIGH OR DRUNK AND DRIVE. DON'T BE THAT FUCKFACE.

I made this account just for story purposes. 

This is the truth and these are my...
# My Druggie Confessionals

......................................................................................


""She's falling out!"" I hear as I'm jolted awake. I couldn't process what the fuck was happening. My mind was too hazy, my tongue had cracks in it and I had only been asleep for three out of 120 hours. 

None of that mattered when a cold, blue and lifeless body was carried and set down less than a foot away. I jumped up, internally melting and immediately began shaking as I ask what happened.

""She's falling out, oh my God!"" A man who nearly fucked me over said.

Well, fuck. I could've guessed that. 

""She did the bag dude."" He said as I sprinted to get ice trays and water, dialing 911.

""911, what's your emergency"" 
Those dreaded fucking words. I hate them. I hate, hate calling police. This time I had no choice.

""This girl. I don't fucking know. She's dying. She did heroin. Other than that I have no fucking clue. Get the fuck here or she's gonna die."" I said as I ripped her shirt off and threw ice on her already cold body. 

More casual bullshit chitchat from the receiving end continues, damn near boring the girl to death before the dope that was far too strong could.

The dumbfuck she was doing it with, the man who nearly fucked me over AND helped kill that poor girl, said as I was on the phone with the police, ""Dude! Hide this shit in your fucking car or we're fucked!"" 

""Send help."" I shouted to my phone as it layed on the floor by the now purple, topless, lifeless body. Then I hung it up.

I told the man to give her CPR. I ran to wake up the owner of the house, my best friend and told him there wasn't time to explain. 

""Drugs! Now! Hurry the fuck up dude!"" 

He darted to I'm not sure how many parts of the house. 
It didn't take any more than 3 minutes and I was given a box full of methamphetamine, heroin, marijuana, pain killers, straws, baggies, scales. The whole kit.

I grabbed the box, wrapped it in my sweater and casually as fucking possible walked to my car and threw it all in the very back. Hidden under a tent and a bag of charcoal.

I get back to the house and Dumbass isn't giving her CPR, he's trying to do a shot by a dead girl. I wouldn't believe it had I not seen it.

""Oh my fucking God dude what the fuck? Get the fuck out of here or get the fuck away."" And he did. He disappeared into the bathroom as I beat the fuck out of that girl's chest.

Adrenaline isn't the word. The methamphetamine that I'd been doing wished it could be that strong. 

""Police Department!"" 
And there they were, hovering over me as I pound on a nearly naked dead woman.

""Thank Fuck."" I say and I'm instructed to go outside.

I was placed in handcuffs, for reasons I still don't know. I was treated less than a human for doing nothing wrong as the girl was taken away to the hospital.

""You know you fucked up. That girl could die. Paramedics gave her 4 doses of Narcan on your buddies floor..."" Officer WhoGivesAFuck says to me, a look of disgust in his eyes, ""dispatch heard someone on the phone while you were on it telling you to put stuff in a car, which one?""

""I have no idea what you're talking about."" I say, as I'm cuffed with 5 other people, besides my best friend, on his front lawn.

""Well, an officer is speaking to the home owner right now and if anything is in this house you're both being charged""

Fuck.

I began dry heaving. Hyperventilating. Practically zero sleep in 5 days paired with someone dead and now police will do that. I'm uncuffed.

""I need a drink."" I tell Officer IHopeYouFuckingDie.

""Tough shit kid."" He smirks as he says this.

I turn on the garden hose and start drinking. My tongue thanks me. My heart still wants to just fucking quit.

They laugh their asses off. Making flophouse and junkie jokes.

""Suck a fucking dick."" I say as I spray one cops leg after dropping the hose. On accident.

""You fucking..""

""All clear"" a cop says from inside the house, distracting Officer WhoGivesAFuck and IHopeYouFuckingDie.

Thank Christ. God, I know you're real. Thank you for looking out for us. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

They push me more on who said what on the phone, separating us all for a game of ""Whose A Bitch?"". 

I'm told how lucky we are because they can't search vehicles for whatever reason that I fucking am so goddamn glad for. We are ignored when asking if the girl is okay. They don't give a shit.

As quick as they arrived, they are gone. Warning us all that we will see them again because they'll be staying close, randomly.

I give the keys to my car directly to Dumbass and tell him to get his shit. He does and leaves in his own car. I am pretty sure he had a syringe up his ass at this point and I hope the cap is off. 

Fast forward less than an hour, my friends phone is ringing and ringing. 

The girl is alive. She wants a ride from the hospital.

""You know what the fuck you did?"" He screams. ""I ain't fucking picking you up. There's no goddamn needles in my fucking house and you fucking know that! I'm glad you're ok but honestly you can fuck yourself now.""

I feel bad for her and so does he. Our nerves are fucking shot.

Moral of the story:

If you do heroin. Fucking be safe. Her dealer told her to do less than half of what she normally does. This was China White. She didn't give a fuck and she nearly died and a shit storm nearly occurred.

Not every dealer will warn you. Please, be careful.

They put me on suboxone and have been tapering me off of it. Today I took my last dose, 1mg. Going 18+ hours without heroin (before I started on suboxone) was the hardest thing I’ve ever done, ever. Waking up at 3am because of the muscle pain and anxiety, and having to sit in my dark room for the next five hours until the rehab opened was so miserable. Like I physically cringe and shudder remembering how awful I felt. I could have found some extra h laying around my room or smoked some missed tar on my foils to make the pain go away, but I stuck it out! I did it! And now I’ve been clean off of heroin for 10 whole days!

The nurses at my rehab are so sweet and kind, I’m genuinely going to miss seeing them everyday. But I hope I never have to see them again (at least in the same context and setting). I still think about using heroin, for some reason I miss the secrets, the isolation, and the thrill of doing something “bad”. I miss my friends that I would smoke with and the general lifestyle. But I do not miss the stress and anxiety that I felt when I didn’t have enough or couldn’t get any before withdrawals kicked in. I don’t miss smoking so much I can’t stop throwing up and then dry heaving because nothing is left in my stomach. I don’t miss nodding out so bad I almost wreck my car. And I definitely don’t miss withdrawals. I don’t know if my pre-existing health conditions make withdrawals worse for me personally, but the thought of experiencing that ever again is possibly my biggest fear.

Am I weird or are there other people who can identify? And if you can't, do you think you'd still be using so much if you didn't get the euphoria? ",1526092349.0

# My Druggie Confessionals

......................................................................................


""Hey, come here.."" She whispered to me, while we waited in her doctors office, ""do you feel ok?"" 

I replied to her that I did and asked why she was asking. She smiled and winked, saying, ""Do you wanna feel good? Like really, really good?"" 

Immediate erection.

My mind automatically went to Fuckyville. Population my best friend's mother and myself. Yeah, it's wrong. My best friend would've hated me, but my God I would rip this woman apart. It had been on my mind from the first time meeting her and now it's years past that. She was HOT.

""Hell yeah I do. Do you?"" I said, sightly nervous honestly, totally being a fucking dick and disregarding the fact that we both were, separately, unhappily married at the time. With a giggle she told me to wait until we got out of there. 

(Fast forward through the awkward erection hiding during a routine blood draw from her doctor...)

She disappears into her bathroom when we got back to her house. I had skipped school earlier that day to hustle money and on my way out she asked if she could hitch a ride, and I'd have gave her any.

""Come back here"" echoing from the bedroom.

Holy fuck. Yessssssssssssssss. 

Sorry bro. Sorry wife. Sorry best friend's husband. I'm sticking it to her and I only have that amount of fucks to give.

A needle.

Not what I was expecting. That was the first time I've ever seen one. 
A bottle of 8mg Dilaudid and my topless best friend's mother were #2 and #3 in my vision.

""Yeah, I don't know..."" I said, now peering at her massive titties. 

""It'll be ok."" She says as she gazes back at me from the mirror.

She was surprised that I knew how to do it all already. I hold of bevy of information that is useless to a lot of normal people.

Pill bottle, crush the Dilly in the lid, get a cotton, load syringe with water, crush it, squirt water on the powder, throw in cotton, draw from it.. ruin your life. Fuck tying off. My veins have been unraped thus far.

I just wanted to fuck. My life sucks enough.

""Promise me you won't say anything to X""  she said to me, nervously.

Yeah lady, I'm not gonna. I planned on seeing how deep the rabbit hole went and he wouldn't like that shit either.

""My veins are massive, nearly the size of those knockers"" I tried to add humor to the situation. Yeah, smooth dumbass. 

She laughed. I laughed, then cried inside.

Aaaaaaand thereeeee it issssss.

Ruuuuuuuuuuusssshhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.

Ho Lee Phuk.

There really is a fucking invisible blanket. Opiheads were right. 

Horrible, horrible choice. I didn't honestly know this until I finally decided to try to quit opiates a year later.

Withdrawals sent me to the hospital, my wife at the time had no idea why I was so sick. She still to this day doesn't know I would hang out with my best friend, his mom and a few of my other lackeys and snort so much powder that it rivaled a ski resort.

When I quit I spent two entire weeks passing out upon standing, unable to eat or drink nearly anything, and my side hurt so bad I would cry myself asleep.

The doctor told me I have Hep C as my blood test came back. I should be hospitalized because it's so swollen and my blood is so toxic. I went home.

I bawled. I had only used a needle one time. Apparently that shit doesn't matter. Karma came to collect. I hated that needle and I hated that woman. I hated myself.

I still tear up recalling all of this. My worst decision in my life.

I never went back to that needle and I never went back to that house. The last time I saw my friends mom was because I was a pallbearer at her funeral. She overdosed in that same bathroom a week after I was told I was sick.

I don't have the heart to tell him what I've did. We barely speak anymore and it's because I'm so embarrassed.

Don't. Do. This. Shit.

I'm still on opiates and any drug available for that matter. My wife from this story is my ex-wife. 
My best friend from the story is bouncing to and fro from a methamphetamine addiction. He had been before his mother passed. 

I've never touched a needle since and no one I know knows of any of this.

Edit: I didn't share a needle. She told me it was new. Obviously it wasn't. It was out of the packaging and she had everything set up already as she called my name. She gave me an old one she used apparently.

Don't do it new in the packaging or not. It's honestly overrated compared to what you're doing and possibly losing.",1526080456.0

So I recently moved to a new state and have been making good money at the job I'm at installing flooring. I have a really good friend who lives in the state I'm coming from. I have been mostly clean since I came up here except for the occasional sac of h,and recently broke up with my girlfriend who I am living with. I am moving out into a different plavs at the end of the month

At my work I have been given the opportunity to take on my own crew and make more money than before. So I go ahead and invite this friend up here to come live with me and get clean and even work with me. He has had no work experience and is 20 Years old. Also he has nothing going for him where he's at. Only gets high every day and says he wants to be clean. So I did what I thought was right and invite him up here to get him clean and I offered to pay for his rent for 2 or 3 weeks till he gets clean and feeling better, pay for the gas up here, feed him and make sure he's got a bed and shit, and whatever he may need. Even offered to get him suboxone for the withdrawls to make it easier.

Now to me that's a very rare offer. Someone saying I will help you get clean and get away from all the negative bullshit and people around you and help you out with future opportunities. He seems like he wants to but somethings maybe holding him back? He says oh I want to get clean but I feel like if that was true why wouldn't you say yes to this. It wouldn't be long term either maybe a year and a half until I move back to my old state.

What would you guys do? This is a really good friend of mine that I truly want to help out and get him back on track. I see a lot of potential in him that he is not using and the people around him give no fucks if he's not doing shit with his life. I get its a big change but the only way I actually got clean was getting away from everyone. ",1526079006.0

I’ve been using oxy for a year or so now, on and off. Probably 20 times in the past year. I usually take 30mg orally, highest dose I’ve had is 60mg.  I usually enjoy it, especially after a meth binge. When you haven’t slept in days, hardly eaten... Makes the oxy hit me like a tonne of bricks! 


Once every few times though, it’s extremely unpleasant. Despite being my normal 30mg dose I usually enjoy. 


Basically, when it doesn’t go to plan, I get no euphoria at all. The first sign of them taking effect is getting extremely hot, sweaty, shaky, and nauseous. This will last 5 mins until I vomit. Then I’ll feel miserable for a while, then I’ll again get hot, sweaty, shaky and nauseous. This cycle lasts a couple hours usually, followed by an overall shitty sedated opiate high lacking all the positive elements. Quick bout of nausea every hour or two. The whole time I’m left angrily wishing they’d wear off. 


Does anybody know what causes this to happen? 4/5 times I love it! And it’s the same dose so I don’t understand why 1 out of those 5 times is so different. I have some now that I want to take, but getting hyped for an opi buzz then feeling like trash sucks, so I want to know how to eliminate this possibility. ",1526077118.0

I also now use opiates for severe pain that I have in my back and shoulder. But what started me on my path down using basically anything to make me feel different started with benzos. So I'm sorry if this story upsets any of y'all who wanted to hear about my opiate addiction. But I'm sure many of you can relate to me in someway because doctor's truly are the real drug dealers nowadays.

But January of last year I was admitted into my local ER thinking I was dying. I couldn't feel my legs, arms, face, etc and my heart was literally beating so fast and hard that I was shaking from the beat if my heart. They thought I was bullshitting and just made me wait in the waiting room forever until my girlfriend told the nurse that she legit though I was dying like 3 separate times. They finally brought me back and saw my HR was 196 bpm so they instantly brought me to a room and had me IV'd in like no time. They pumped some shit into my body that stopped my heart and then would restart it but it didn't work so they wanted to do it again with no prevail. They we're giving injections of Ativan every 30 minutes on the dot and had me on all sorts if drips. Eventually when my heart rate got down to 140 without any spikes they moved me to the cardiac Care unit. Still getting Ativan every 30 minutes. Even while I was already asleep because I checked the hospital records and when I was sleeping they were ringing in Ativan injections to give to me. I'll tell you what I was taking a trip on the Van. But the next morning my heart rate was back to normal but they Dr. Wrote me a script for 270 1mg kpins to take 2-3 times a day to stay calm so my heart wouldn't freak out again. That's a lot of benzos to fucking prescribe someone and he didn't have it set as refills I had all of them in one big bottle but I was using them responsibly until my body started needing more. Eventually my doctor prescribed me 2mg kpins 2-3 times a day as needed. Then I told him I couldn't get anything done because I wanted to be in bed all day so he switch my script to 0.5 Ativan 2 times a day. And I'll talk you what I flew through that shit like it was candy. He said he'd try me on Xanax instead and started me off with 120 1mg footballs, then I told him my anxiety was awful whenever i didn't take one. So he bumped me up to 120 2mg bars.Eventually he finally sent me to see a real psychiatrist and she gave me 120 .5mg xanax which was a major drop in my dose and she was like well yeah your body is addicted to them and that's when it first hit me. Even if you think your taking shit for medical reasons you will convince yourself you're fine but I was taking 12mg of Xanax a day which no person should have to take. Fuck my hospital.

To keep it (kinda) short, I had been going through withdrawals for a couple days and had gotten a text yesterday a little after noon that the dboi had some bupes, so he hooked me up with 5 for a fairly good price and of course I took a quarter of one to get those aches away.

Here’s where the story part comes, so I woke up this morning and looked at my stash and realized I did 2 8mg bupes last night, probably reason being I had been on a bar and a half before I got the bupes even in hand. 

QUESTIONS 
1: How long does buprenorphine stay active in your system?
2: Will I suffer bad withdrawals once they (bupes) wear off? (Don’t have a high tolerance to H, or buprenorphine either. Never have done heroin only oxys and hydros for years but HAVE done bupes before) 
3: Since these don’t have Naloxone will it be any different?

Many of you that complain of paranoia from sativa would probably enjoy an indica body high","I’ve seen a lot of posts talking about how weed isn’t the cure all that people claim....I agree.

However, one of the main arguments I see used is that it makes people paranoid or antsy.  I would guess 90% of this is what your smoking.  A nice indica strain/edible will really relax your body.  It obviously won’t breakthrough your pain like an oxy quite would...but it will definitely
Help with relief, sleep, and just relaxing. 

The problem really is since access to medical marijuana is still very limited in the US most people resort to street weed which in my experience is usually going to be a sativa or hybrid of some sort.

I’m an everyday smoker and I really notice a huge difference when I’m in medical states and am able to use my card to pick the strain I want.  You know what to expect and a lot of the indices provide an extremely relaxing body high. 

Either way I believe that medical marijuana will soon be readily available.  In the mean time I really hope doctors stop cutting people’s scripts just to put less opioids on the street...their only adding to this epidemic I have seen ravish my community/state and furthermore country.

Everyone be safe this weekend, tell your mom you love them or if you are a mom have a lovely time.

Okay, so I'm new to opiates so I'd appreciate you guys' help with this. A few months ago, maybe a year, an older relative got messed up and several people punched him in the head and stuff. He was wrecked. Fast forward a bit, I go looking around in his house and find The Stash. I'm talking hundreds of pills of oxy 10s and hydro 7.5s. I skim a couple bottles but he has so many that I made off with a not so bad amount.

I tried the oxy's and one had me nodding good. Interestingly enough this was my first opiate experience. I smoked a little weed and had a good time. A couple days later, I take 3, 7.5mg hydro's and wait an hour-ish. Nothing. I take another 7.5 and wait some more. Still nothing. For reference I am male, 5'7, and 135lb.

Sort of slipped up a bit last night. Not exactly a relapse as such, more just me being a bit of a dickhead. I found an old, well, basically a small metal dish made specifically to cook shots that I got with some needle kits I ordered way back when I thought I wanted to shoot heroin (turned out I didn't, luckily, I'm way too much of a pussy lol). Anyway there was a light dusting of that tan brown powder you get here in the UK. Spent last night trying to smoke it. There was so little that I didn't really feel any effect, and I took my buprenorphine dose this morning with no ill effects so I'm not too concerned.

But that fucking smell. I can still smell it on me even though I've washed my hands. It reminds me of the short period of time when I was using heroin, when that smell was the only thing I could smell. It's hard to describe. I've heard people describe the brown heroin as vinegary and I can understand that I guess but I'd say it's more of a sickly sweet smell. Maybe it's not even the heroin but something else. I've quit smoking cigarettes too, and I guess you could compare it to that (not the smell but the sensation of association). But cigarettes smell awful to me now even if they do smell somewhat tempting, this heroin smell is just nice...

I’m also worried about the heroin, but I have a prescription for codeine so I might be able to get away with using that as a reason for their being morphine in my system.

So When she asked i knew i could front her.................she paid me back later than planned. i was sick  for most of the next day for my generosity. that was okay. obviously I was not thrilled then, but i received more than I asked for the delay.   I didn't want that either though . i'm not sure what I wanted. these last few days were the reward. did she get infected these past months ? i know junkie scum germs  can be hella contagious and devour friend groups. was the front really the antibiotic army that rose her faith in victory? all i know is she has been completely different with everyone since the front. seems ridiculous but she just needed some kindness. a restoration potion.  this game -these people- wear you down. i got more out of the front than her. i needed reminded too. the scratch off gift was nice -it didn't hit the gratitude in me. it should have. i just needed the right puzzle piece to combine it with. luckily i answered her call - i made the right choice. that stranger helped me and everyone around her. he had handed it to me with out looking up as we walked passed each other. he didn't wait for a thank you and mine was mumbled any how out of the surprise confusion. so i wish you all to bump in to a lottery ticket. for whoever may need it",1526023202.0

So I've got a decent tolerance, nothing too crazy but a g a day, sometimes only a half g if I'm really trying to stretch it out. The stuff is decent, not the best I've had but definitely worth it as the price is right and the dboy always pulls through without waiting a second. That and the bags always weight perfectly.

So on to my question! Have you ever been hitting the foil and get one hit the same size as any other, but end up getting way more fucked up than normal. Can you cut bth with fentanyl?

 After we sat and talked for a minute and then I was like sooo, you know where I might get some brown? He was waiting there for it himself already so he called his dude and asked for 40 instead of the 10 he was getting. We walked over to where him and his girl were camping out for the night, talked about life and chilled out while we waited.

Long time lurker who will occasionally chime in on posts.  I bought a beautiful apartment this past August and after gut remodeling it, my girlfriend and I finally moved in together.

Going from living with the guys for 7 years made this a bit of a culture shock and I haven't had much freedom to use and the like - which landed me on bupe maintenance (from which I skipped up a few times, but the purpose of the maintainance was to keep from going down hill while starting my new life with my last.)

ANYWAYS.  My girlfriend's coybtey made the world cup, and she will be traveling to Russia to see them play against Denmark - for a trip that will all in be about a week.  I was planning on taking a few vacation days away from my job to enjoy the feeling of having the apartment to myself, have a good ole fashion ""relapse"" (if you can even call it that given my use history), and just chill out and watch the world cup for a few days.

I have been working on my rainy day stash (mostly dope and some benzos at this point in time) but wanted to venture out to grab some of my old favorite pharms - along with some others I haven't tried, opportunisticially between now and world cup time so I have myself a good ole fashion smorgasbord to choose from once my week of freedom hits...

Quick note to the mods I AM NOT trying to source here, simply get the opinions of the folks around here for the goal state of my buffet.

For the week off I was hoping to include:

Items i've had or tried before:

- Some more dope (have 4 buns already) 
- 7-10 of the OP 80's for maintenance and perhaps mixing up with sodas
- 3-5 MS contin
- 10ish blues

Items I haven't tried or used before:

- 4-5 of these pandas I keep hearing so much about - even if I will have to pay the ass out for them
-5-7 dillies


About my tolerance:  currently on bupe maintaince (8-12 MG / day). Though in my experience if I do dope the next day after using subs it may take an extra bag or so to get going but it usually isn't a huge hinderence.  That said I plan to ween down in the days / week proceeding perhaps throwing some kratom in as needed.  Other than that I would typically do about a bun a day redosing throughout the day every couple hours (ish).  It is also important to note that I'll only use intranasally 

So my question to all of you is how what would you stock up on if you were me for this monumental occasion?  Is there anything for my stash that I haven't quite thought of that you may recommend?  Should I get more of one thing and less of another?  I can't imagine this happening again too many times before i put a ring on her finger so I need to make it count (though safety first). 

TLDR:  bored financial professional's gf is going to Russia world cup without me.  Need help with ideas on completing my opi buffet for my week off of freedom and debauchery.

So my old friend from the methadone clinic I knew for 2 years I hit up since that clinics doctors switched and left his clients fucked FYI. Tells me here$ a number to call. 

Doesn't tell me that like 25 people man the phone and that the number I'm callin is only one they use to get numbers down and then call back to get to you. And that they man the phone 24/7 all night. So basically a huge crew and I didn't think those even existed in central canada I've never met one.  I find usually dope here is like 200 a g for garbage and 300-350 a G for quality but hell I've had shit at 300-350 too. These charge 250 but I'm fine for that for delivery, quality and overweight as well as free bags the more you buy and refer people.  

Thought since no one responded no one would call back but by the way the run the rumber I get a call back in 10. Guys says he will be 45 minutes. And lo and behold hes here in 45 minutes. Yay delivery. Rolls up with a sandwich ziplock bag full of rolls and I just about had a heart attack lol. 

So I ask buddy for a variety bag since I do like good China white fent dope with legs ( reminded me of that certain vendor that does level 1 and x China white in potency and legs none of that hour shit). 

So I get some China white holy Clean strong and long lasting. Also get some amazing grey dope that could be minimally cut with fent but looks and feels raw and like high quality dnm purchases I've made. Also got some of the rawest definitely  straight white raw fire. Usually don't bang but had to bang this stuff.  

Also didn't realize but they do coke too so I grab a gram for 80. Holy Christmas batman this shit is amazing blow. Next time I pick up ( maybe today) I'll send a picture.

I think this place even has horse back riding (no I’m not a rich bitch i just live in a country with good health care where addicts are treated well) I’ve been riding my whole life and I’m stoked cuz normally I couldn’t afford to ride it’s too expensive here it’ll be a treat.

Now when i call my hemotologist to ask for another script she says no. so i had to go for over a month with only ibuprofen and tylenoy w/ codeine i got from urgent care -_-. There was even a time when left from being admitted in hospital for a over week from a bad crisis where I was receiving everything from morpheme to dilaudid and fentanyl and they refused to give a script because I had already received one within the same month. This is beyond annoying. And when i was first admitted, the stupid ass doctor(not my hematologist) insisted on giving 8mg morpheme every hour when 10mg wasnt even doing shit in the ER. [can anyone please explain to me why that would make sense? fr i genuinely tried to understand his point and still dont. sorry for the rant] when i finally had an appointment with her she goes down and prescibes me 7.5MG WHEN 10MG WASNT EVEN WORKING. I get she doesnt want me get addicted or whatever but i just wish i could put them in my body then they would shut tf up. Ive been dealing w/ this all my life but they forget about the times when i was younger and absolutely despised taking medicine and now they’re causing me pain because... idk they might get in trouble for prescribing too much or fear of addiction but this is just frustrating. Im done with this children’s hospital now theyre just not being empathetic(im almost 19). I dont take them as prescribed because of tolerance but i dont abuse them and they usually last a lot longer than the supply/time period , but recently I was prescribed 10s and i couldn’t make them last. Thankfully they believed that I was accidentally taking them every 4 hours rather than 8 because thats what my old script said, and thankfully im not on this list yall talk about lol. I was seeing a psychiatrist at the same place and this man was mad at me for running out of oxys and even said he was gonna stop seeing me, untill i gave him the same excuse ( assumes patient is addicted to oxy and wants to cut them from their psychiatric source... niiice doctor. i hope all hospital arent this evil) (I thought i was on a list when he brought it up)ive literally been to the hospital 3 times in the last 3 the months and it seems like they only gaf about the amount of oxy i take and not the pain being experienced.   This is when i was moved back down to 7.5 and now im out and in pain :))).

I'd assume this is common sense but the amount of people completely ignorant to this lethal combination is just ridiculous. Me and my dude pick up some caps, Midwest is flooded with fent so 9 times out of 10 we get fent caps with the rare exception that some real dope comes through and it's generally underwhelming because of the fent  we're used too. 

We were told it was real dope, I told him I guarantee it's fent, they were pure white 3/4  filled caps which are almost always fent. We stop by another buddys, he throws us both a couple bars. I immediately tell dumbass to save those bars for when you're in WD. These are potent you don't need to waste them this evening. He kind of blows me off but doesn't take any while he's with me. We leave, I drop him off and go home. Less than an hour later I'm getting a call from his frantic brother that he's unresponsive, not breathing. I tell him call 911 and put everything illegal away, thankfully he had already done both. 

They ended up narcaning him twice I guess and he came too, he said he took not one but two of the fucking bars when he got home after snorting more dope. The paramedics said he's lucky to be alive because if his brother hadn't happened to walk in and see what he was doing instead of just leaving like he'd planned dude would be a goner for sure  

So please, everyone, save the benzos for another time especially when using dope/fent. Please. It's not worth risking your life. I know in this particular incident  the user was very reckless but he had a decent tolerance to both fent and benzos and almost lost his life thinking he'd be okay. 

How many of you know someone who has overdosed on fent/dope or a mixtures of benzos and fent/dope? Almost every overdose of people I've known in past year has been because of fent or fent and combination  of benzos and fent.",1525934533.0

I was doing everything you could think of. I made so much money that i didnt even bat an eye to my use. I figured I would be able to maintain this life style of using dope all the time. But as time grew longer, my days filled with regret and despair for my use. I could have been saving money and investing every coin I made. Nothing felt right as I continued down this road. The constant paranoia of being sent to prison. The constant sadness of my wasted time as I spent my days nodding away. Spending so much of my time inside of locked bathrooms and bedrooms. I felt I had enough. I was using so much that I was beginning to lose my hair and it became raggedy. My anxiety has always been horrible, but never this horrible.


That's about the time I quit using every opioid you could find in the black market. The withdrawals were horrendous, but only lasted about a week and a half. I was still out of it every day and I had intense anxiety. So, i decided to buy 125 grams of kratom for $20 USD. I tried it once as a teenager and didn't care much for it. As soon as I took that first dose, I finally went back to being normal. I felt that blissfulness that wasnt too overpowering and allowed me to be tranquil. And if I needed to go in a stressful situation, I would take more than I usually would and feel that amazing opiate high.


My anxiety has finally been lifted. My tremors are so far gone from my life that I've finally become happy again. Simply knowing that this substance can cure my anxiety better just like any opiate did, I found the holy grail. I found the one thing in my life I could be proud to look forward to, and without the repercussions that dope would hold over me. I'm back to chipping the substance to whenever I need it. The withdrawals only make you tired and don't cause much anxiety either. There isnt that draw towards it that makes you scream for more of it like fentanyl and its cousins had. 


For any of you being taken over by opiates or opioids, trash it all and take kratom. It's made my life so much better and I can finally start achieving all that I wanted to. I've been with this community for years now and I want to help everyone else here, as well. Do it for yourself, because no one else will.

So background is I've been using for 3 years daily with about 7 months of sobriety in there, longest being 5 months in a row. 

I know I'll get shit for this but I've only smoked dope, and at first I believed that was the reason why I never got sick, but when I got sober for 5 months I had planned with my buddy to do it together, it was both our first time cleaning up after using everyday for about a year and a half. 

So I let him stay at my place and I bought us 40 Xannies, 3 subs each, and I bought us a strip of acid for afterwards to straighten out our heads and move forward from dope. 

I get us a ball (3gs) and we enjoy our last night sitting in a hot tub bullshitting, and getting high.

Morning comes and I wake up to screaming coming from my living room, I laid there for a couple minutes trying to mentally prepare for it, but nothing. My buddy on the other hand was profusely sweating, threw up on my carpet, and when I tried giving him some xanax he became enraged accusing me of using. It became a huge argument and even though I honestly didn't use I couldn't convince him otherwise, I gave him 40 dollars and he went to use, I stayed with my plan and got sober. 

Fastforward 5months and I find out my buddy had started shooting up and died the first week he started shooting up. 

we still were hanging out all the time, he apologized for what happened, him still not understanding how I dodged the ""bullet"" when we both picked up from the same guy and I used more than him (was using a ball in 2 days compared to him using a half g or if his finances allowed him a full g every 2 days) 

Even though he was constantly using in front of me I had no desire to use, and we just hung out but after he died I picked it up again. 

My habit of out of hand quickly and started using the dark web to get fent, I thought for sure I was physically addicted, I would wake up with a sore lower back and had no energy to do anything except sleep or pickup and hold me till my next package arrived. 

I'm like a good 14 months into daily use and 10 of those months mainly using fent, I end up getting pulled over and they tell me they smell alcohol (complete lie) I pass the breathalyzer long story short they say I'm on drugs and find an old weed pipe. 

Its friday night and I'm sitting in jail unable to get out until Monday because my card is on me and no one can pay my bail. 

I pass out and wake up Saturday morning fearing the worst but surprisingly I feel better then when I wake up at home. I immediately noticed I didn't have any back pain and other then being a bit down due to sitting in jail for another couple days and maybe getting a dui, I realized wasn't sick at all, even the day after, nothing the whole time. 

I go to the arraignment on Monday and talked to the public defender, being told that from my drug test i had to take, the police painted a picture I was a junkie, but convinced the judge who wasn't going to release me, that if that was true wouldn't I have been sick? And that I came up positive due to prescribed pain medicine. 






TLDR:
Used daily for a year and a half with good friend, both only picked up from same guy, I used a ball every 2 days, compared to friend using a half g sometimes full g if he had the money every 2 days. 
We both only smoked, yet when we tried to quit and get sober, only he got deathly sick, sweating, throwing up/dry heaving. 

I quit for 5 months, relapse, and after 2 months of using start using mainly fent for 14 months daily only picking up dope if my packages were late or I didn't make them last long enough. I get arrested and sit in jail from Friday night to Monday, no withdrawals, nothing.

I was talking to my therapist today and told her about this, as it has been worrying me somewhat, and she said I should consider talking to my doctor about it. I'm just worried that if I tell my doctor that I've become dependent on the meds they will assume I shouldn't take them any more, because of further addiction potential, and stop the prescription.

1). Remove pill coating - put in mouth and suck for 7-10 seconds then wipe the coating off with a paper towel 

2). Using a sharp ass knife or razor blade, half or quarter the pill

3). Place your pill bits on a generous piece of aluminum foil 

4). Turn your oven on broil and out the foil with your pill bits in the oven (preferably not top rack as this puts you in jeopardy of burning your gear). What you're looking for is a very dark brown color, that's how you know they're ready. Crisping the pills might take anywhere from 30 seconds - 5 minutes depending on the strength of your oven and how close they are to the heating elements.

5). Once you have sufficiently crisped your pills, fold the foil over and crush them flat with a rolling pin, spoon, whatever you can find. Now you should have some small plasticky lookin' wafers.

6). Find a large spoon/ladle. It can be hard to get an entire pill into a shot, so I often add about 2.5 cc's (2.5 syringe fulls) to my ladel, add my opana wafers, and then just bring it to a light boil and stir stir stir. Filter, suck, shoot!

P.S. There is almost always some pill material left over after your first shot. This is great, as it allows for sometimes up to 4 or 5 decent hits off of one pill. Opana is the crack of opiates. ",1525902727.0

I have been around the BTH game in the PNW for a couple years now and I have encountered killer stuff all the way down to shit that is completely fake. The main way I judge the quality before consumption is the strength of that gnarly vinegar smell. 

Generally, as far as looks go, the obsidian looking shiny stuff tends to be better than most. However, that isn't always the case. 

Yesterday I picked up a ball from my dgirl who always has fire. But this stuff was gooey as fuck! So gooey that I was wasting a lot at a time trying to throw it on foil until I put it in the freezer. Now this stuff is super good, but I haven't seen BTH get that viscous before. 

Is the viciousness due to the lack of cut, therefor it makes sense that it is a lot stronger than normal? And yes I understand that when this stuff gets hot it is gonna be a lot meltier, but this was above and beyond that.

I have been trapped in this stupid pattern for the last 4-6 months: I use for anywhere from 2-6 weeks, then get on sub for a few days to a week and a half, then stay sober for 2 weeks to a month, and then relapse rinse and repeat. I had one year clean from opiates in November and then relapsed, I have been trapped in this cycle ever since. 

      I have finally figured out how to make this induction period a little easier, these 24 hours (more like 12) used to just kill me; the anxiety involved in preparing and waiting for it, the self loathing because I know I've done this to myself, and just the empty feeling of starting from square one every few weeks/months is physically and mentally draining. Not to mention the physical/mental symptoms of withdrawal (acute and post). I am fairly prepared though: I have 1mg of Xanax, buying some edibles tonight, couple mgs of klonopin, 8 8mg sub pills, and a few other little WD aides. I basically knock myself out for the last 12 hours of the sub induction period, it makes this process about as painless as I have ever experienced it. There is no way to describe that pit in the bottom of your stomach when you wake up in the morning and immediately your first thought is that withdrawal is coming (or its already started), you aren't getting any dope, and you basically wont be leaving this bed or room for the next 12-16 hours. 

     Being on opiates I feel like a shark in the waters;  embrace everything head on, not afraid of anything, not worried about shit, like an apex predator. Getting off of them I feel like a little fish out of water, it feels like I have gone for the bait (dope) and got the hook stuck in my mouth. I have been reeled in and up to the shore/boat and now I am flopping around on the deck/ground: everything I do is uncomfortable, everything is scary (or at least induces massive anxiety), I have no energy, and I am usually just fighting to breathe and not give in to the temptation of using dope again because I know that is the only thing that will fix how I am feeling but ironically it will also plunge me deeper into this fucked up mess. I hope everyone out there is enjoying their high if you are still using, I only wish good things upon you: short waits, great quality, and enough quantity for a morning dose. If you are in recovery I hope that y'all are starting to settle into your bodies (not feeling like your skin is crawling), anxiety is manageable, each of life's mundane tasks cease to feel like climbing Mt Everest, and the anhedonia is starting to lift. If you are in more long term recovery then I hope that life is good and you are well on your way to becoming who you want to be!

Will I feel anything?","Happy Tuesday my wonderful r/opiates friends! I know the half life of Suboxone is fairly long... and I apologize in advance if this question has been addressed in the recent past (I’m sure it has but idk how long ago and google hasn’t helped). Oh also I have a fairly high opiate tolerance; been snorting 30mg pandas daily for about 3 years now and just recently switched to ECP about 4 months ago going through half g’s daily.

Nevertheless, this morning at 9AM I took an 8mg moon. I snorted half and dissolved the other half under my tongue. Right after the 2 lines I started sneezing about 40 times like I snorted a King Kong finger sized line of pollen. I feel as though most of what went up my nose came out in the hotel sink... 

So here are my questions for you insanely knowledgeable people. Does anyone half any idea how fast the absorption rate for suboxone is when snorted? And did the 4mg I snorted actually not work at all and only the sublingual 4mg I took actually got into my system and stuck to my receptors? Last question... Since I took the suboxone about 11 hours ago, Will I be wasting this half g of ECP if I snort it all over the course of tonight?

I'm facing a dilemma because I don't know whether to drink 2oz tonight on an empty stomach and hopefully get a decent high, or if I should wait until next week, when I'll be able to get my hands on some 5/325 hydrocodone pills and mix the two.

It's truly insane how much opiates will numb you and have you failing to see the real reality of your life. I had to grab the reigns this time and put myself in check because I was spiraling to lows most people don't get to. Homeless is the easy part sometimes.

I'm only 48 hours in and I've blocked out 75% of withdrawal so far with Kratom but I took my last dose around 8 am and the effects are wearing off. I'm broke and can't get more. I'm pretty much in full withdrawal from a half g to a g a day habit. I smoked a blunt and I'm beginning to get all the feelings and emotions I've been fading to the back ground.

I hope I stick through this withdrawal and see the other side. The physical agony is pretty fucking terrible and makes me want a shot just to be able to function. I gotta get through this though. I have to.

I'm lurking since a few months, but sometimes I want to answer somebody, so here's my story in short.

I get fent patches (50) since some emergency surgeries last year. Tried some drugs before, smoked weed since decades, but never tried opiates. When I was about 20 a friend once smoked heroin, and the special happiness from which he told me was a huge warning. I never touched it cause I knew I would like it too much.

There were times in hospital when I didn't want to live anymore, so I started thinking of ways to kill myself should I ever get in this situation again. Boom... heroin! And it's of course better to have something in the house said my brain, and I nearly bought something. But it would be too easy to try it, I have a ""port"", a subdermal steady access to a vein (sorry, I don't know the english word). So, no heroin in the house. Weed is ok too.

I don't know if I still have pain, but when I forget a new patch my mood gets worse every minute. I also have morphine tablets and oxy, sometimes I take an oxy, only 10mg, because I like the feeling. It's a lot warmer than the fent, this only makes me calm and more tired. But, Weed is ok too.

I really appreciate this sub and his members.

I've been clean for around a month, until today. If you recall from my previous posts I mentioned that my mother said she had a stash of Percocet when my sister used up her script and was waiting for a refill. I wasn't able to find said stash.



Until today. I just flew back home last night. It was in her underwear drawer, the one place I refused to look, because eww, gross. While on the plane I actually assumed it was probably there because she knew I wouldn't look there.



Two pill bottles, one with maybe 13 5/325 Percocet and the other with probably 18 5/325 Vicodin. So I relapsed, I took 3 of the percs and 2 of the vics with 2 pint glasses of white grapefruit juice. Damn it felt nice, still feeling it a little now. Started reading ""House of Leaves""- weird fucking book, even harder to read when you're softly nodding in and out.



My tolerance surprised me, even after a month of sobriety I still felt like I probably could have taken twice as much in order to get where I really wanted to be. Of course I can't take any more, because it would be obvious that someone has been digging into her rainy day stash. I'm home for another 2 weeks, knowing that there are pills here that I can't take. 



It's a fucking bummer but it's probably for the best. She also just refilled her script for Ambien, so I snagged one of them because I'm bored. Damn I'm a shitty human being.


Idk what the point of this post was, I'm bored and feeling a little blue I guess.",1525749423.0

I had a friend tell me a couple of months ago who swears up and down, in the southern USA, that she was with her Lady but they were coming back pos for fent. Now obviously they could have been in cahoots with each other backing each other up if she got a batch of pressies on the street which is what my gut was telling me was what really happened.

So I have been buying them from walmart. 

Lately though it seems they’re kind of tightening up on things. Last time I went to the one that always sells sharps to me they asked for my “insulin card”. I just claimed that I’ve shown it to several staff members at this location before, I come here often etc etc so the pharmacist sold it to me but said in the future I need to bring it every time. At another location the same thing happened but they didn’t sell it to me at all. (Side note: these two times were the only times I didn’t go in wearing business clothes from work, dress shirt, tie etc, and surprise surprise I got shit from the staff. Appearance really does matter). 

So two questions I guess:

-is Walmart cracking down on this lately? Where I am there is no state law prohibiting sale so idk why they are doing this. 
-what exactly is an insulin card and can I fabricate something like it? Is it just an insulin prescription? Anything I can do to be more convincing about buying them for legit medical reasons, maybe buy some test strips too? lol...

I also know that there is a form of insulin that is OTC in my state, so maybe if I buy that it will be my ticket to smooth sailing buying sharps?

Anybody have any idea what this stuff could be? It doesn't strike me as pure cut, especially since cravings stop after I do a bag. And it doesn't add up that it's just *mostly* cut, because I feel like doing a whole 5 or 6 bags would overcome that issue and I'd get loaded anyway. Could it be Suboxone or something?

Anyways long story short, I was on mmt for about 3 years up to 85mg at my highest and jumped cold turkey from 60mg and went through the longest withdrawl of my life, about a solid month until I got better. (That shit really gets into your bones) 

After that I was clean for about 3 years from everything except weed (which I really don't even consider a drug) and booze (my drinking did get a bit out of control there for a while) 

Naturally I started fuckin around with blues about 2 years ago; and the only on weekends turned into everyday and full blown addiction again very quickly. 

Fast forward a bit; I moved out of state back in February for many reasons; one of which for me (moved with my boyfriend who knows of my past struggles but doesn't know I've been using for the past year ; I'm a piece of shit obv) 

When we moved I came with 1 8mg sub pill, used it to taper than switched to kratom and was completely clean (except kratom) for about a month until naturally I found a new connect out here. 

Been goin hard af on the blues for the past month & a half or so. Just took my last 2 blues (4 total for today) and have decided that's it, I need to take a break for both monetary & tolerance reasons. 

Thankfully I have about 250g of kratom left & managed to cop 1 8mg sub strip. 

Now I've never used the sub strips, I've only used the pills in the past & railed them because I think it works much better that way (ba and what not) and also I'm an addict & love snorting (although I eat my blues because of the higher ba and not wanting to waste them) my question is , has anyone actually snorted a strip? Obv I've googled it and found a few things but would much rather hear about it first hand (experience /methods) from you fine folks :) 

TL;DR: need to take a break from the blues, has anyone snorted sub strips before ? And if so, how did you do it ? And do you think it's worth the effort ? Or should I just use sublingual ? ",1525719983.0

8hpqnr,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8hpqnr/getting_off_black/,10,https://redd.it/8hpqnr,Ridnod,Getting off black,"Haven't been on this subreddit before but I felt this was the most appropriate place to clarify an issue I believe I might be having either right now or in the near future.

I've been addicted to heroin since I was 14, I'm 22 now. A ""friend"" got me into it and at the time I only knew about black tar heroin, I didn't know it came in a powder form. Anyways I started off smoking it and because it made me feel so incredible I never once questioned what it was. Deep  down I knew it was probably something I surely shouldn't do but I made sure to delude myself enough to not legitimately question it. 

The worst of these 22 years of my life was when my mom died 2 and a half years ago, it was a sudden death, I saw her body afterwards, and I blamed myself because I had a bad premonition but I didn't act on it. Everything went down hill from there, Loosing my mom destroyed me and I lost my job and girlfriend shortly after because I stopped caring about both of them. My dad is the only reason I'm alive. We're closer than ever now.

I got off heroin 20 days ago because I was spending about 300 dollars every 2 or 3 days, shooting up about 80 dollars worth at  a time or in short succession. This sub doctor I got in to see those 20 days ago put me on 24 mg of suboxone a day, because my opiate tolerance was so insanely high, I do not get any kind of high or buzz off of the subs, however I am slowly starting to notice a difference; they are beginning to give me an energy, uplift my mood a little bit, and even make me opiate-tired a little bit after my third dose each day.

Is this a sign my tolerance is lowering? Am I just on too much suboxone? I got my job back and I'm doing very well so a suboxone addiction is the last thing I need. My doctor plans to continue this amount for at least a few more months. Is that a bad idea judging by the effects I'm getting from subs now?

The past is the past. No point crying over spilt milk.,"Feeling remorseful is great. Proof you’re not a sociopath. But it’s kind of useless and holds you back because it’s easy to get caught up in a vicious circle of guilt that prevents you from actually doing the work to get back on track. You’ve already apologized a billion times. Your family and friends make you feel more guilty because they don’t know how else to cope. Don’t take it personally but don’t let it bring you down lower. 

If you wanna feel less guilty than do  ACTIONS that will give you a good life and  those bad feelings will lift. 


I need to follow my own advice. But honestly? I’ve gotten  better at letting go. I got to the point where I reached the max of reeling like a POS junkie scum bag. I couldn’t have felt lower. So I decided it’s pointless to cry. I’m a junkie (recovering but junkie non the less). I can’t change that. FUCK IT. mom and dad will have to get over it too. I did everything to make them happy.

Anyway. I never used to get this, but recently, when I get narced I have found it exceedingly difficult to pee. I'm assuming it's because the muscles in the bladder get relaxed to the point that they can no longer do their job. So at the moment I'm having to wait for the most recent dose to begin to wear off, grit my way through the oncoming sickness until I feel able to piss, and then take the next dose to feel fine again. Or, if I really need to go, I usually can after a few attempts.

But it's getting pretty ridiculous. I'm just back from spending literally 90(!) minutes sat on the toilet with a very full bladder silently screaming and flexing all my muscles, thinking about weeing, running warm water over my fingers, literally everything I could, but still nothing.

I have in my possession various types of benzos. I have Diazepam, Nitrazepam, Temazepam, Flunitrazepam, Alprazolam, Lorazepam and Clonazepam. Before anyone asks, I am scripted two, have bought several and the rest have been freebies from online purchases.

So to my question; I have combined both Diazepam and Nitrazepam with Oxy (I am scripted these) in therapeutic amounts with obviously no problems. Now, I would like to get the full effect. I have zero benzo tolerance.

Which benzo would compliment Oxy the best and at what dosage to get the best combined effect.

I am fully aware of the risks involved. I would just like an idea from someone with experience of combining the two.
