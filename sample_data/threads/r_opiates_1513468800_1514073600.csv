Also, I know benzos and dope are a big combo with people. People feel the same way about Kpins and oxy? I mean I mix em but I can't say it does a whole lot for me other than make me fall asleep faster. I almost feel like it diminishes my oxy high. Be safe everyone.

So when I quit using opiates, I got a really serious case of pink cloud. The pink cloud was super useful in staying positive and motivated in the face of PAWS and having to deal with being sober living again.

I started using kratom extracts to help with a very busy time at my job, but now that the time has passed, I want to quit using extracts and go back to complete sobriety, this time for good.

I was just wondering if anyone has any experience quitting extracts and if you experienced a similar pink cloud in the aftermath. I have quit kratom powder before after 1-2 years of using, and I don't remember any such feeling. But that may be because I wasn't familiar with the concept back then. Also, the extracts are considerably more potent, so the wd and aftereffects will probably be more exaggerated.

I might ask in the  kratom sub reddit, but figured I would post it here first as r opiates is probably more familiar with the pink cloud concept and how it compares to kicking kratom. ",1513508438.0

Also 4 days clean of H.,"I finished school not long ago. Got an alright paying job, but the pay sent my dope consumption out of control. I finally got smart, set an appointment with an addiction specialist and got put on subs the same day.

Day 0) Saw doc. Get script. Go home, sleep a few hours, go to work and wait for the withdrawals to start...

Night 0) I really was afraid of PWD, and probably waited much longer than I needed to before dosing my daily 8mg. My nose was running like a firehose, constant cold/hot, shaking, anxious, tense, muscle spasms... I was pacing around my work like I was going mad (thankfully I was alone at the office.) When I decided the time to dose had come I stuck it under my tongue and just an hour later, I began to see what feeling normal was like again.

Day 1) I work overnights, my days/nights are backwards from the rest of the world. Continuing from Night 1, I get home at 8am and eventually get to sleep at 11am. I'm still craving pretty bad at this point but I'm not physically withdrawing. I wake up 5 hours later absolutely covered in sweat, bed sheets stuck to me.

Day 2) My dealer figures out something is up as I typically drop by every day. Blowing my phone up probably thinking I found a new dealer saying shit I know isn't true like ""got some new stuff"" ""got a great deal for u $60 4 $100."" I tell him I'm quitting. He says he won't try to contact me. I know it's not true and block his number anyways.

Day 3) The mental cravings are significantly less now. I've been logging my dose times and slowly pushing it back 1-2 hours each day to get to the point where I'm taking it when I *should* be waking up on most days. My day 1 dose was at 6am while at work, and I won't typically be up at 6am on days off. I'm closing in on my goal time.

Day 4) Went with family to my college graduation today. Shook hands with a few of my favorite professors whom I hadn't been sober for in class for the last 5 semesters. 

Day 5) We'll see when I wake up.

rules:  
1. pick a unique username. this is to protect other users so we know who is who, given the nature of the sort of activities we enjoy.  

2. no lurking. again, to protect the other users. if you come in the room be prepared to introduce yourself and participate for at least a few minutes so we know you're not up to any shenanigans. if you are lurking you will be warned and then given a generous ten minutes to announce yourself. if the time runs out, you will be kicked (not banned) until you are ready to come in and actually participate. if you are a known member whose identity can be confirmed, this rule is not applicable.  

3. no -isms or hate speech, even accidental. one warning will be issued, any continued insistence on such behavior will result in a ban. bans can be contested by pm'ing a moderator (me). this includes but is not limited to racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia. for example, if you are not black, use of the n-word, even with the -a ending, will not be tolerated. i don't care if your friend down the block lets you say it, it's not your lane.  

4. no auditory fuckery. due to peculiarities of the transmission of sound over a chat, certain echos and effects can be amplified to the point of being severely distressing. if it is determined that your end is causing an echo you will be asked to use headphones, or to mute your microphone when not speaking. deliberately making strange or unpleasant noises to annoy other chatters will not be tolerated, and your broadcast will be closed. (this only means that your video/audio feed will be terminated--you will still be allowed to type. this appears to be less of a problem with the new chat app.)

I was about 2 minutes from my destination when flashing lights out of nowhere. I was coming up to a fork in the road where you either had to turn left or right, and I made a left and pulled over. 

Cop comes up to my window and the first thing he says is ""Have you ever been arrested?"" Gulp. I tell him yes, for possession. (My case was dismissed tho, so I'm freaking out that I'm in trouble again). Even though I had nothing in the car, I was scared that I might have forgotten some baggie under the seat. 

So the cop gets my liscence only and pulls me out of the car and says to place my hands... On the trunk. I for sure thought he would say behind my back. He asked me if I knew why he pulled me over and I honestly had no idea. It was for my ""registration light"", or the light above my liscence plate being burned out. 

This really seemed like a formality as they really did not care about my stupid light bulbs. The cop proceeded to grill me asking my name (thinking I would lie), why I was in this area when I live far, when's the last time I used, inisiting I was coming here to ""buy"".  He asked me if I would allow a search of my car, I said yes not feeling like I had a choice, and the other cop proceeded to look all through my shit, including taking all my cards out of my wallet...?

The interrogation continued. Where do you score from? Is it a house? A hotel? Does he have a name? What does his car look like? 

I basically gave them bullshit answers, telling them about the car and name of this guy who sold me Comino (spices) for $50. Lol. But I don't tell them anything that I'm sure they don't already know. These cops were mad. They kept asking if I had anything in the car, and they really thought I did.

Since they found nothing, they told me to GTFO and fix my light. I was so relieved to drive away. I have since fixed my liscence plate light, and encourage anyone who drives to check theirs. 

But I was shooken up. I felt like I was being interrogated when I technically had done nothing wrong, at least drug related. Other than being white in a high traffic area. I really dislike how they lead with making me think I would be arrested, then they ask ""Are you alright?"" When I appear nervous. Of course people are nervous in that situation! 

The cops almost left without giving me back my I.D. They must have really cared about my registration as they never even looked at it. 

I'm rambling at this point, so the tldr is please check the little things on your car that can get you pulled over. You might be the safest driver who is always sober and never speeds, but get pulled over for something small like I did. ",1513486410.0

Through that progression I had struggles and would have given anything to be my old self.  I lost my future, my friends, and the love of my life. Of course, I would take that all of back if I could but that has passed. I eventually had a year clean and found a spiritual awakening. That had wiped my slate clean and refreshed me to a point of peace. But at the same time it showed me life in a perspective which I wasn’t sure how to handle. Sobriety was dull and beautiful at the same time. 

Everything had become meaningless which freed me but had also troubled me. It’s so difficult to try to progress in society when you ask the question, “why?,” with every action. In the end I don’t know what I’m looking for, and that will likely never change as long as I try to fill some void.

Since I’ve relapsed after that, I haven’t felt the desperation that I once used to. Im not longing for the same fairy tale lifestyle that I once did. I’m just doing what I do. It might not be much, but it is something. Maybe I need that purpose, or maybe I just need a girl idk. However at the same time, I’m not sure any of these are more than an illusion to keep me chasing a wild goose.

So my question is: Do you feel like even though with everything sobriety has to offer, you’d rather stay with this lifestyle? Given all of the pain and struggle, it still gives life purpose. In the end, that’s what life will always be. At least in this way of life you have something to live for, even if you may die for it.

So I am in my mid-to-late twenties and have enjoyed many different drugs of all classes over the years. I deviated from the stimulants some time ago, and have grown more fond of downers in recent years. I think I possibly suffer from Seasonal Affective Disorder and have been addicted to benzodiazepines two of the last three Christmases. Therefore, aside from what I like to tell myself, I know the potential for addiction is always there.

I have used oxycodone on occasion over the past two years, maybe once every 2-3 months or so. I really enjoy the warm, euphoric high it produces, but never felt the urge to take it more often than that.

Until recently. In the past few weeks I have had access to pharmaceutical grade morphine. I smoked heroin about five years ago and always wanted to try the IV route, but was afraid due to impurities etc. In the past two weeks I have taken 5-10mg of IM morphine on three separate occasions. I said I would try it just the once, but the opportunity kept presenting itself to me. I also took 20mg of Oxycontin with the last hit of morphine, it was bliss.

I have browsed this sub for a long time and have seen how people fall down the opiate hole. I can see how this could potentially happen to me, and am basically looking for some insight into how I can stop this. The morphine is 100% pharmaceutical grade so no chance of it being cut with fentanyl or anything like that. I do not want to end up an opiate addict. Any advice would be much appreciated, thank you",1513601510.0

I know I haven’t solved the issue of weed burning too hot but I feel a lot more comfortable wasting the residue on my blunt then by dropping a Gs worth and mixing it in the blunt. I’ll come back and update this when I get the chance to spark it up.

Used to come on in active w/d’s and stare longingly at the other addicts like myself who were high. Used to read stories from people just like me, so I wouldn’t feel alone. Used to start detox threads for moral support, only to inevitably use shortly after. I want to share with you guys/gals my story. A shortened version.

My background before drugs isn’t important IMO. Started off with blues in college, and eventually transitioned to IV heroin. Same song and dance. First stint in rehab at age 22. From 22 to 26 I would do 8 more rehab stays throughout 3 different states. Never making it more than a month after I got out. In the beginning it was so fun. The risk, the feeling, the danger.... I chased it. And when I caught it, I prepared to chase it some more. My life was consumed, as we all know. I firmly believe that there are two types of addicts. Those who can keep people at bay for a time and carry on with their lives hiding their secret until an eventual (and inevitable) catastrophic implosion. And those who cannot. I started as the first and ended as the latter. I eventually could not hide it. I slept all day, barely ate, and eventually withered away to a shell of a human being that I didn’t know. After about 2 years (give or take) the drugs stopped being fun. My tolerance sky-rocketed, and even with east coast dope (won’t give away my location but notoriously has the strongest powdered heroin in the country) I was struggling to walk the line of getting high and not overdosing. Age 22-had my first OD. 2 more would follow. One of which I was hit with Narcan 3 times, because the first 2 didn’t work. But I kept using. Eventually, like so many people reading this, I lost hope. I lost hope that my life would ever have any real value beyond wake-scheme-cop-sleep...rinse wash repeat. The happiness I once remembered (true happiness) was depleted and far away it felt like an insurmountable journey across a barren sea. I tapped out, and my whole world became a room, a car ride, and a few cycling names that would facilitate my addiction. A cyclical hell...rinse wash repeat. 

Eventually, I ended up in a different state for treatment. Same old story, said all the right things, got out with good intentions and feeling better, met a girl, and you all know the rest... relapse. But something would change the course of my life this time. A child. The girl I met was in recovery too, and got pregnant. And all of the sudden we had to make a life-altering choice. Now, I know what some people are thinking. “Two kids early on in recovery is a disaster waiting to happen, should’ve had an abortion.” And you’re right about the first part. It was a disaster (in the long run). Ultimately, we decided to have the child. I won’t lie, my life didn’t immediately get better. In fact, it got worse for a time. I used off and on during her pregnancy. I’m not proud of it, and In fact I’m down right ashamed but I can’t change that now. I have learned to accept that’s who i was.

About 4 years ago my daughter was born. Slightly before that happened I was at a crossroads in my life. Here’s where my story gets important. One day, after a huge fight with my daughters mother, I realized something. At so many points in my life being clean or off H didn’t seem worth it, and now it all of the sudden did. I realized that either my daughter would be removed from life forever (rightfully so), or I would have to get my act together. I envisioned a life filled with doing what I’d been doing for 4 years, or a life filled with being a parent. Being someone that has purpose. My child gave me purpose. Now I’m not saying having a kid is what you should be doing, or that kids alone can keep you off the smack. They can’t. But for me, it was enough to push me in the right direction, instead of the opposite. I chose suboxone maintenance as opposed to rehab to try something new, and never looked back. Right before my daughter was born was the last time I used H. 

Fast forward 4 years to now... I got a job in healthcare, ironically in an ER. Can you guess what I do? Well for starters, I take care of Overdose patients. Those same patients who were once me. I help nurses administer the very same narcotics that once controlled my every movement. Dilaudid, morph, fent....It was weird at first, but now I don’t even think twice about it. The important thing is, I built a life for myself. A real life that, for the first time since I started using, was better than using. A life that makes it worth it, good days and bad days alike. A little person who gives me purpose and calls me “daddy” was a big part of it, but not ALL of it. 

I also got back in college to finish up, a few months after I started sub maintenance. I had planned on just finishing and going right back to work. I got interested in science... and working in health care was kind of just a catalyst for my eventual interest in medicine as a career. One thing led to another and I began pursuing medical school. 2 months ago I was officially accepted to my top choice out on the west coast. My goal is to become a surgeon.  

I don’t say that to gloat. I hope people don’t get a high horse vibe. I don’t think I’m better than anyone here. I say it to [hopefully] give some of you guys/gals hope. A lot of people on here talk about how shitty recovery can be. And they’re right. It downright sucks the D in the beginning. There’s no doubt. But give it TIME. Time is so so so important and as addicts...we hate it. We want immediate gratification. Everything has to feel good right away. Right? But keep pushing through. Nothing ever came easily that was really really worth it. It comes with hard work, dedication, and perseverance. There’s no other recipe. 

My life today is amazing. I stumbled on this forum last week to reminisce and am so happy to be where I am. My shittiest days now are better than my best days back then. Chasing a fleeting feeling that I knew would ultimately make me sicker than a dog. You always have to pay the piper...there’s no other way. Sometimes you can cheat the physical, but it’s nearly impossible to cheat the mental...which happens to be the hardest part. 

My future is by no means set in stone. I have many obstacles in my way. And stressful times that will test me. But I am at a point where i can see things clearly now. I don’t regret the life I used to live. The strongest creatures in nature are the ones who’ve been mentally and physically tested. The ones who find a way to survive even through seemingly insurmountable odds. The life of a junkie was empty-to me. Maybe not to others, but it was to me...and I lost everything. And still, even through everything I’ve been able to accomplish in the past few years, there are numerous irreversible consequences and damaged relationships that I’ll never be able to fix. And I accept that. 

I hope this helps. I don’t expect a bunch of people to drop their rigs and run off to a sub clinic, or treatment. But I do think it helps to hear success stories from people who actually get what you’re going through, and or understand where you are in life. I know it helped me. ",1513578285.0

Between about 30-50s, the reagent turned a VERY faint yellow/pink color that was hardly noticeable.  After 50s, it began to turn pink/light violet, and eventually became and stayed dark violet.

Annnnyway, he's super sick one night and all our usual connects are done for the day.

Money changes hands.
My brother, ever the skeptic, checks his shit right there and finds out he just got sold a huge bag of hard. 
Dboys about a half block away, and my brother's too sick to give chase, so he yells at him ""HEY, THIS AIN'T WHAT I ASKED FOR!"" 
Dboy breaks into a run and yells over his shoulder ""I HOOKED YOU UUUUUP!!"" *-cue doppler effect of the sound falling off as the guy runs away-*

True enough, he *did* hook him up. He got a fuckton of hard for what he paid, but who the hell wants to smoke crack when you're dopesick? Of course, my brother went home and smoked all but a rock of it, which he found when we went to go do another deal together, and he goes ""Oh, yeah... hah... uh... want some crack?"" I dont fuck around like that so I turned him down, but he said he didn't want it at all, so I took it off his hands and just tossed it out the window on the drive to the spot. 

Anyway, I'm still chuckling at the d-boy, who *knows* he fucked up, but still *tried* to make it right in that weird, drug-game logic, calling ""I HOOKED YOU UUUUUUUUP!"" running away from a sick junkie he knows won't give chase.

Throughout my time abstaining my feelings have been that as far as I'm concerned, heroin can go suck a fuckin cock, so long as that cock isn't mine. Yeah some days are tough but I've for the most part been repulsed by the idea. 

But today. My god, today. I've been thinking about it so much, but not just thinking about it, actually considering it. I hate it. I don't want to have my mouth water at the thought of a shot, but I'm fuckin drooling. 8 weeks is the longest I've gone in a solid few years, and I'm pretty god damn young so I can't stop now. I'm around heroin all the time, I'm offered heroin all the time, and I don't know how but I've been able to turn it down in a heartbeat up to this point. So here's the rundown. 

First off, can't be sober tonight. Fuck that don't even try for that option guys, it's not a real thing. I have to slam something because I'm a disgusting IV fiend, and as mentioned heroin has been jumping up and down trying to volunteer. However given the distance between myself and my last shot, I know heroin is just a mean fucker and I can't give any room for that bitch to get my balls again. I've been shooting and on/off selling meth like it's going to disappear from the earth any day lately, so that's an option. However my tolerance is starting to show itself so it feels like a waste of what little money I have. So then I look at my other option, heroin. Fuck that though got 8 weeks, have to look at other options. Oh, meth. Won't get high enough, what's my other option again? This is the loop I'm stuck in. 

Junkies gonna junk, tweakers gonna tweak and fiends gonna fiend. I'm all 3 of those right now and have to satisfy. I can't break out of the mindset for heroin and it's honestly really scaring me. What the fuck do I do?",1513570215.0

I gotta get this outta my system.

Anyone else ever overdose on cocaine? I'm not talking like uncomfortable and throwing up, I'm talking about not being able to inhale, just gasping and your throat is shut?

Here is my story: 

So I got out the joint the first time (not this time) and I meet this guy that is selling a bunch of cocaine and meth, and just a little bit of the hair-on. I pretty much upped his heroin game in no time flat, ended up moving in with the psychotic fucker (there is another horrible story about this fuck to follow, don't worry) I am slanging helli heroin for him, and he normally would give me a ball of coke for free about once a week. Enter the speedball. I would normally sit there and shoot it all with my girlfriend (RIP Kaila) and have a grand ole fuck fest.

One week he only had hard on him and he threw me a massive ass cookie of it, probably 5 grams. Now mind you, I don't smoke fuckin' crack, so I was kinda shitty and I just threw it in my Crown Royal bag-full-o-drugs for later funsies. A few days go by and I wanna shoot me a speed ball, fuck it, I got crack and strawberry Kool-Aid, we about to get SPUN! I do like 5 shots back to back all in the same spoon, everything is great. I mix up another shot and my guy calls me and asks for a half-g, says he is right down the street at DG already, so I oblige him and run it there and come back in like 15 minutes. Fuck yes! I have a shot ready! Pull that fucker up and FUCK ME! I knew it was gonna be bad about 3/4 of a plunger push in. I am pouring sweat already and I am dry heaving but nothing is coming out. I go to suck in air...and NOTHING! Cannot get my throat to open!

Kaila, God bless her soul, is standing there screaming at me to breath, crying her eyes out, and like beating on my chest, just complicating the fuck out of the situation. After about what seems like 5 minutes (probably only 1 minute) I can finally get a bit of air in my lungs. 

What had happened was I wasn't letting the acid in the Kool-Aid break the base down long enough on the previous 5-6 shots. When I left to make the play I left the shit sitting for 15 minutes and it broke EVERYTHING down. I'm guessing I did about a .6er of about as pure coke as you're gonna get because of the salting process.

Think about it, if you have ever truly indulged in your life ( quite a hilarious thing to say to an opiate forum haha) then you know inside of you that the material world and materialism are not happiness and that happiness is found within the mind and the consciousness hence the reason addicts seeking comfort sell materials and material services for the bliss, calmness and most important of all the indifferent view of the world the mind has when you use, and the lack of need of acceptance disguised maliciously as pleasure by Heroin. Doing heroin, for everyone I feel is similar, theres a knowing in the mind regardless of how good you feel in the body, that you have been tricked, and to avoid anguish and misery you agree with it just as someone captured bends to the needs and wishes of their captor.

(lurker thoughts),"**Background**: I am a lurker. I spent a few years addicted to high dose prescription amps. I was never on the streets or stole. but lied a lot. ended up burnt out and borderline insane. tons of health problems too. nowdays the only drug I do is shrooms and coffee. Weed makes me demotivated. I rarely drink. I am a straight edge software programmer at the moment. I lurk on the drug subs just out of interest. I had some clarifications

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao8L-0nSYzg

So I am sure many people on this sub have seen this video. it seems to have a really nice idea or larger message. That the core of addiction is lack of connection

And to a degree thats true. I think many people looking at addiction seem to forget that addiction and poor mental health often go hand in hand (at least in my experience). And that addiction is a very complex mix of many factors. But on the flip side, what the video gets wrong is that people in hospitals are doing opiates due to pain. I could be wrong here but are the dosages of opies used for pain much lower than for euphoria? (I am not experienced with hard opies, so could someone chime in?). Also; don't people who use opies for pain use it for shorter periods of time in a hospital? I also presume (and hope) that doctors are incredibly careful to wean you off of it, and ensure you have little background of drug abuse

**Overall, I would like people on this sub to poke holes in the video. I think its a little overly simplistic. Speaking from my speed addiction, its partly true. but not a complete picture. Noone I know closely is addicted to heroin luckily, thats why I am on this sub. I think if you gave heroin to 100 people who were mentally healthy, a significant chunk of them would end up addicted**

For me, my main focus is to decriminalize, and set up some sort of morphine maintenance program of some sort. That would be ideal to me. As with maybe meth. E and LSD maybe can be tightly regulated in a similar way. you get a card and a proper background check to buy a set amount monthly etc. I am not sure legalization (available openly with no restrictions) would end nicely for the simple reason that making something this addictive available to the public openly like that could end badly. Some sort of regulated system needs to be in place though. because fuck fentanyl. the idea that you have a chance of dying everytime you do any hard opiate scares the fuck out of me. its gotten to the point where cocaine, xanax, Ecstasy, and even weed are getting cut with fent",1513543010.0

Please, my dumb ass is desperate for assistance.","Ok, so after watching multiple instructional videos, this is what I'm doing...

1. Flush micron wheel filter with clean water to prime it

2. Put unfiltered brown solution in a syringe with no needle (edit: through a cotton). Make sure this syringe fits into the cylindrical opening in the center of the disc all snug-seal.

3. Insert the other end of the cylindrical opening in the center of the disc, the smaller end, into a clean syringe that I intend to use on my vein.

4. Push plunger down on syringe with unfiltered solution.

Now, at this point this is what happened on my last attempt.... nothing was coming through. Then, I tenderly removed the syringe with the fluid, and saw that the brown solution had just pooled up in the cylinder. So I sucked it back up - or what I could manage to suck back up. Then, inspecting the filter, it appeared that the brown solution was all up in it, and there didn't seem to be a way to suck it back. So I chalked that up as lost solution. :(

I am convinced learning how to use these things is vital for my health, but for the life of me I can't figure it out. Can anyone help or point me to a resource that can help?

I have been through this ringer dozens of times , in the past it was near impossible , by now I'd be looking to cop at least a xanax (probably  heroin) or completely miserable and unable to do work.  I wanted to explain what has changed because I feel that it could at least help some people.

I wonder if you guys [have heard of rat park?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat_Park) Someone did an experiment where they found that rats in a cage would prefer cocaine over water and food .  They would choose coke even as they starved to death.  The conclusion was that coke is so addictive that rats lost interest in survival.  However a later researcher noticed how miserable their existence was anyhow so he set up a ""rat park"" where rats had plenty of activities , they could play or have sex or do the things that rats enjoy doing.  The results were very compelling (pls read link if you are unfamiliar) but the basic lesson is that it wasn't the addictive property of coke which led the rats in the first experiment to ignore things critical to their survival , it was their awful living situation.

This has a lot of paralell to modern opiate addiction.  The communities who get hit worse are those where there is no clear path to a better life.  However , the problem is more general , our society is so inhumane in that even people ""who make it"" are just as miserable as everyone else and often succumb to one addiction or the other.  Everyone is on something because we live in a society which values abstract concepts over human needs and desires.  

So , we can't escape society and I don't think suicide is a good option because there is enough about life which makes it worth living.  However , we can find ways to make our lives more expansive and satisfying , for me this starts with learning skills so that one day I may be able to travel a lot more often and have experiences which I value rather than being subject to the dreams of other people.

My point is this:  Every other time I went through withdrawal , I was a miserable fuck who had nothing going on in life and (I felt) no basis to love myself or think I was good or useful person in any way. My life was so bleak and my mood so close to depression that withdrawal destroyed whatever weak structure I had created to support the idea that my life was meaningful.  Day one of w/d I felt how deeply unsatisfying and awful my life was so there was nothing to look forward to once I got to the other side.  The physical stuff was bad but it was my lack of a sense that what I was doing was meaningful which made it 100 times worse and started the cycle of depression.  I never understood when people said it was ""just like a cold"" because under that discomfort was pretty severe mental distress , so it was like trying to sweep the floors of your house while all the doors are wide open on a windy day.

Recently, I started making some changes.  Things like taking classes and recently (over break ) studying for a network+ certification.  Of course there are other things , volunteering at hospice , getting involved in local politics , adopted two dogs who I love , doing a lot more hiking etc.  Not stealing from or being a completely unreliable shit to the people who I loved was also a plus. 

About two weeks ago a ""friend"" in college gave me a gram of black tar instead of money he owed and I was still too in love with that substance to refuse.  I got 3 8mg sublingual tabs as well since I remember how awful straight up heroin w/d can be.

The rest went as expected , took my subs at about 2 mg then 1 , a little bit of a taper down.  I know this is nothing compared to people who have been on subs/opiates for years and are now totally terrified of stopping but I've had that experience too.  I stopped the subs on Thursday this week and felt like complete garbage physically , worse than many times before because I had no tolerance and forgot what to expect.

So the physical symptoms were absolutely horrible but since my life feels much fuller than it ever did before , my head was fine.  I didn't despair , beyond feeling dumb for falling into the opiate trap again.  It meant that my suffering was now meaningful because I had goals to accomplish and people who depend on me.  I feel that my life may actually go somewhere and I may , one day , after lots of work , be able to live a life which I find meaningful and as satisfying as life can be.

I know I went a long way to make a fairly obvious point but I honestly never realized this until this time around. I just want you to know that the worst part of withdrawal is that it triggers your depression , feelings of low self-value , feeling of being a failure or lacking healthy connections with others etc.  But when you are actively working on your life (even if you are sincerely doing so while getting high all the time) then you will have a foundation for recovery.  That foundation makes the physical symptoms just that , and it truly feels like a flu or something which you know will go away soon and in the meantime, you have activities which you enjoy , people you love and a plan which you are dedicated to that will make those 3 - 5 days of the worst part go by very quickly.

So after 20 years of being terrified of withdrawals I finally understand those who consider it ""not a big deal at all"".  For them withdrawal was just one event in the context of a rather full life .  I promise all of you that if you build a meaningful life , w/d will be so small in comparison to that , that it will feel like a cold and nothing worse.

Good luck.  I love all of you , we have more in common that most other people alive today.  Please keep going , stay alive and you will be grateful for that decision soon.

Then I got a call from Junkie Jesus (in this case some drunk mofo I never hear  from) telling me he'll set me straight if I drive him to get some crack and let him smoke it while I drive him around.  I'll tell you what, nothing is more worrisome than being chilled out on heroin sitting next to some guy who, after hitting a rock, thinks EVERYTHING is the police.

Well, he gave me $40 (!!!) so I hit up my friendly dopeman and got a .15 and thought about hitting it last night but wisely decided against it.

So, my point is (no pun intended) I'm waiting for the first w/d's to kick in which usually consists of my armpits sweating (sucks!) and a sour stomach along with gagging at any attempts to smoke a cigarette.

I just took 3 oxy's thinking ill be fine since ive been on codeine for 3-4 years...

And wew, its a very different high, i feel like i can just sit here, play path of exile, and watch south park on the screen... but i also feel heavy headed, like, it takes effort to turn my head.

Also, my back feels fine, i hope that i don't get hooked on oxy since apparently it's far more addictive then codeine -.-

Like a few posters on here, I'm a first time poster and long time lurker of this sub.

Quick run down of my situation, 27yrs old, been taking oxy, xans, vals, tramadol, tapentadol and lyrica. Had a cycling accident about 4 years ago that lead to a pinched nerve in my neck, chronic migraines and eventually lead to compressed nerves on both sides of my lower back (L4 and L5). Lost my job as architectural graduate because of the amount of time I was taking off because of the migraines - up to 2 weeks sometimes with a few days in hospital on more than a few occasions to help relieve the symptoms.

Anyway, I was mainly taking tramadol at the start cause it helped and it felt good. I was a bit worried about the whole lowering of the seizure threshold when you go over 400mg in 1 day (I think thats right?). So my neurologist and Doc agreed to try me on 2x 10mg Oxy/day. That was almost 3 years ago and now currently I'm alternating from 2x 20mg Oxycodone/Day and 1x 40mg Oxycontin/Day. Over this time I've received scripts for Valium and Xanax for muscles spasms.
I nearly always finish my scripts early (sometimes taking 80 to 120mg/day) and thats when i get the tramadol, valium, lyrica or xanax until i can go see my Doc again. Sometimes it's a week early, no serious withdrawals just a bit of an upset stomach is all. I'm not going to lie to you guys, I do take them recreationally some days as well as obviously for the pain I'm in.

Scariest part about my story (apologies for how long this is getting!!) was that I ended up having a seizure one afternoon after taking about 800mg of tramadol over the course of the day. Thought that would be 'the wake up call' that you would see in a movie or something, however the seizure just lead me to hurt my neck and back further, so... back to the Oxy.

Having the seizure means I can't drive for 6 months (1.5 months to go), and I just had a bit of a 'mini breakdown' today when it sort of all hit me at once, kind of felt nice afterwards to let those emotions out. I live with my partner and I feel like some sort of burden on her. I'm having financial issues while I work at a cafe (trying to get back into Architecture) while she's just graduated and started a new job with a generous salary. Being stuck at home, no driving, barely any money (very very fortunate to have parents that help me out when I'm in serious financial trouble)... I'm like a stay at home dad, but without kids!!, taking oxy and spending my time on the couch watching TV or drawing.

How do I know if all my problems are because of taking drugs? Being in pain? or am I just having a seriously bad 2017 and I just need to keep pushing until I can find a balance of work and pain relief? Weekly physio and pilates, walking a lot (cause of the no driving), and starting back at the gym, I'm really trying to get my shit sorted... But fuck most days I can struggle to walk or stand up for long periods of time because of my neck and back pain and I simply need the oxy!

Again, very sorry for the length of this post! I guess I'm just curious if any of you out there are in similar positions or have found some type of balance? Or if you've simply weaned off from the drugs and found a way to live with the pain?

Any suggestions are clearly welcome!
Cheers.

Some new information about the chat is in the post, along with link and rules.","**if anyone knows of an app or browser that will allow access to ezcapechat on mobile, please let me know. apparently, according to ezcapechat, it just has to be something that will run flash, but you'll still be unable to stream video/audio from mobile although you will be able to hear and see others' streams. thanks.**  

thanks to a couple of our venerable r/opiates moderators (/u/kickersx12, /u/travs3dpe) agreeing to help out with the mod duties for the chat, we're now located in the sidebar again. also, I wanted to explain that the room exists and is open for people to hang out in any time they like, not just when a post has been made as a reminder. feel free to use the room at any time. it doesn't belong to me or anyone else in particular, i'm just there to keep the power on and the water running, figuratively speaking. we now return to the usual announcement below.  


the chat is going to stay hosted on ezcapechat because it actually has admins you can contact with problems and bugs, it's far more stable, handles data faster, appears to lack the echo problems that tc had, has a functional youtube player that anyone (not just mods) can add tracks to and it forms an automatic playlist, and you can personalize the chat text and color, as well as move the cameras around more freely. the room is at [WherEiSopiatechat](https://www.ezcapechat.com/rooms/whereisopiatechat). If you can't click links for whatever reason the address is https://www.ezcapechat.com/rooms/whereisopiatechat. We've had a good group coming in which is still growing, with biting wit, naturally ebullient conversationalists, excellent cross-genre musical selections, and just the right admixture of nods and grime. We have a lot of fun, so come check it out. Continue below (or not) for disclaimer and rules:

**this chat is not affiliated with this subreddit or its moderators, and has its own moderators, rules, and etiquette. if you feel someone there has slighted you take it up with the moderators of tinychat, as it is completely unaffiliated with and not endorsed by this or any other subreddit.**  

rules:  
1. pick a unique username. this is to protect other users so we know who is who, given the nature of the sort of activities we enjoy.  

2. no lurking. again, to protect the other users. if you come in the room be prepared to introduce yourself and participate for at least a few minutes so we know you're not up to any shenanigans. if you are lurking you will be warned and then given a generous ten minutes to announce yourself. if the time runs out, you will be kicked (not banned) until you are ready to come in and actually participate. if you are a known member whose identity can be confirmed, this rule is not applicable.  

3. no -isms or hate speech, even accidental. one warning will be issued, any continued insistence on such behavior will result in a ban. bans can be contested by pm'ing a moderator (me). this includes but is not limited to racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia. for example, if you are not black, use of the n-word, even with the -a ending, will not be tolerated. i don't care if your friend down the block lets you say it, it's not your lane.  

4. no auditory fuckery. due to peculiarities of the transmission of sound over a chat, certain echos and effects can be amplified to the point of being severely distressing. if it is determined that your end is causing an echo you will be asked to use headphones, or to mute your microphone when not speaking. deliberately making strange or unpleasant noises to annoy other chatters will not be tolerated, and your broadcast will be closed. (this only means that your video/audio feed will be terminated--you will still be allowed to type. this appears to be less of a problem with the new chat app.)  


i know the rules seem like a lot but there's really only four of them, and only two that pertain to just behaving in a manner that isn't dickish. thanks, and hope to see you there! **don't use alone.**",1513657804.0

My current meds don't help enough.,"I am a 27 year old male. I have an internist who I've seen for the past year....it took 6 months just to build a relationship with him. He gives me #120 oxycodone 5 mg for my crohn's disease....but it's just not enough. I've pressed and pressed and even used pain journals to show it's not helping the pain enough....which was just ignored really. If I press any harder I would lose my prescription.

I really like him, but I don't have a life. I'm struggling even with the pain meds which I feel I am lucky to even get these. I AM trying to treat the root of the cause but I've been allergic to 4 of the medications, and the other 4 haven't done enough. There aren't many treatments for crohn's at the moment sadly.

My question is what do I do? Do I try a pain management clinic without a referral? (He won't give me one). Do I try a different internist? Do I just suck it up and try and live with the pain? (Not sure I could do this if I wanted, I'm miserable)

I could really use some advice, my pain is at a 5-6 almost constantly every day. I've been to the hospital 15 times in the past year and a half for blockages.

I used to think we pill-heads were ""safe"" (or at least ""safer"") from fent, but my good friend just OD'd on Saturday night thanks to some fucking fent-pressed M-boxes.  I knew something was VERY wrong when this good friend dropped some pills off to me, and I told him they didn't look right, and they also weren't the right weight (I weighed them).  He tried some anyway, figuring his high tolerance would be able to withstand a little fent... and then he stopped texting me for 16 hours. 

Turns out he OD'ed, and landed face-first onto the floor in the middle of the night... and thank goodness his Mom somehow found him and gave him Narcan. He's alive, but almost didn't make it. It is friggin' *terrifying.*

Apparently M-boxes are faked the most often, and just this weekend I noticed several posts here in this sub about fake M-boxes, and/or people asking if their M-boxes looked legit (they weren't). 

__I am BEGGING my fellow roxy/oxy enthusiasts to heed these warnings:__

*  1) __Familiarize yourself with what real M-boxes look like.__ Take note of the shape of the M, and how the two points on the top of the M should be filled in more, almost reminiscent of a Motorola M.  If it looks like the same boring Arial-font M, IT IS FAKE.  Also, the ""3"" in the ""30"" on the back should be vaguely reminiscent of a McDonalds M on its side... the beginning and end of 3 shouldn't curve around and point towards each other, but should point almost straight out.  
*Here's a helpful thread with photos for identifying fake roxies:* https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/5l1rkg/fake_pill_post_for_fashionablyfake/


*  2) __Get yourself a cheap-ass scale on Amazon and weigh your pill before taking it.__ *Yes, I know it's an extra step. Is your life not worth it?* M-boxes should weigh 130mg each.  ( *Here is a list of how much pills should weigh each:* http://www.bluelight.org/vb/archive/index.php/t-508296.html  -- and  *Here's the scale I have and it's less than $20 on Amazon:*  (American Weigh Scales GEMINI-20 Portable MilliGram Scale, 20 by 0.001 G https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0012TDNAM/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_YtgoAbW5JSNPH ) 


*  3) __CARRY NARCAN, and ask your friends and family to carry it, too.__ Many pharmacies carry it; so do needle exhanges... and if you have nowhere else to turn, there are beautiful souls on this subreddit who will mail some to you. Read the sidebar-- the info is there!  (And here: http://www.getnaloxonenow.org/GetNaloxone.aspx  )

*  4) If you use in secret and nobody knows about your usage, please do not take any pills that you are not 100% sure are real. Nobody will be able to save you, then. It is better to feel like shit than it is to feel like DEAD. 


I love you all very much. I am so grateful my friend didn't die and that his mom was able to save him.  I know many, many people aren't so lucky.  Please just be safe... __an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.__

Love, Grandma



*TL;DR: If you like pills, please follow these steps to help make sure you stay safe. There are a ton of fakes out there and we pill-heads are no longer ""safe"" from fent. My friend OD'ed and we almost lost him.*

I'm fucking miserable.,"Hello friends. I don't know if this even belongs here, but I don't know where else to go with this.

I first started using when I lost my mom, fucked with hydros and oxys for about a year before my ex helped me quit. Her words were ""I want you to be around for awhile so we can be together."" Just the thought that someone could care about me that much helped me quit, almost cold turkey.

I've recently moved to a new town where I know no one, and the only thing keeping me off of opiates is gone. My three-year long relationship has ended, and I genuinely don't know anyone that really, genuinely cares about my wellbeing anymore, including me. It's not that I'm suicidal (anymore), its just that I really don't care if I was to die any time soon.

This past weekend, I had a stressful business trip and I came home to my boss yelling at me over some presentation I had dropped the ball on and pictures of my ex in the arms of another man on her Instagram.

Long story short, I popped about 6 percs over the course of seven hours and drank quite a bit of liquor until I passed out.

I woke up about four hours ago, feeling like shit, and now all I want is to find more pills to go back.

Honestly, the warm, fuzzy hug of opiates right now is the best substitution I have for any human contact or concern about me. The opiate high, at least to me, feels like someone I love holding me close and telling me everything's going to be okay.

He started out supplying us with girl for about a year. Never thought I’d be able to get off of it. Eventually we switch to boy which our dude has as well. We had a really tight relationship with him. Great prices, we’d give him rides, hang out, whatever. 

Recently, things went downhill with dude. He couldn’t afford his rent payments and he’d call us asking us to spend or just asking for money. Which we’d never be able to help even if we wanted to. One night, we were chillin with friends who wanted a G of girl. So we call dude and ask for the G plus a $20 is boy. We get there, he walks up and has a friend with him. He never has anyone with him. Plus, he didn’t want to get in the car which was weird. But whatever, my fiancé hands him money and he gets a tiny bag and dude walks away. We look and it’s just the $20 of boy, so where’s our girl? He acted like he’d be right back so we wait. He eventually walks back over and asks why we haven’t pulled away yet. We tell him we’re still waiting on him to hand us our G of girl. He FLIPS out. Starts swearing he gave it to us, swearing on his kids etc, saying we’re lying and just trying to get more off him. It was obvious he was playing us. So we go through the motions. . Searching the car and the area though we all know what’s going on. We end up going home with no girl and no money. Our friends were pretty cool about it.

Couple months go by, we haven’t fucked with dude in a minute cause of that BS. He still needs money. Says he has some great boy, and his sons birthday is the next day. Well, I don’t get paid until the next day. We’re sick AF, so tell him if he looks out for us on a half we’ll pay him back double the next day. We pick up, and it’s awesome shit. We enjoy ourselves and I don’t answer any texts or calls for the next two weeks. 😂😂 To be fair, he probably only paid $20 for that half I’m not about to be out another $100 to him after all that shit that went down.

Im going to go ahead and make the jump to taper down with these and get clean off dope since ive been making a somewhat half assed effort these past 2-3 weeks to try and stop using which just hasnt worked at all. Now that ive came into these pills, and about 105 of them i want to go ahead and use them wisely for the opportunity to taper down over the next month or sooner to go ahead and get off dope and have as little pain of withdraw as possible.

I'm hoping for some insite to an issue I'm having. Since I was 15 I've been eating domes, hydro, oxys off and on amd never had a real issue, until I was in a car accident about 2 years ago now. I was in pain management with 15 mg morphine er, and 10mg percocet.  And I would finish my script in about 2 weeks, every week. 

Fortunately For me, an old army vet buddy of mine,  gets morphine 60s, and oxy 30s. And I had a pretty reliable connect for the OP 80's (which I think are shit, but I'd kill for one right now) anyway so on and so forth I was chewing up anywhere from 120, to 240 mgs of morphine on any given day, and/or 180 to 300 mgs of oxy a day. Sure it kinda ruined my life a little bit, but I blamed it on the pain and the car accident. ( i spent $20k, my entire settlement on pills and hotels in about 2 months) . I felt like if I went 6 or so hours without something I would start feeling withdrawals.  

Okay so ran out of money, wanted to die, been a shit parent, and finally I'm like let's get clean. (Alot of it was no longer being able to afford drugs, and realizing I had been such a shit parent.) So in the last 2 months I've only taken kratom, except for maybe like 15 morphine 60s over a few days one week. I don't have withdrawl, I'm okay, as long as I take kratom. But yesterday it hit me. I tried everyone I knew to spend some of my rent money on some oxy,  but to no avail. I did find subs tho. I'm gonna get one this afternoon. So I'm hoping to hear what you guys think. Is it worth it? Is it gonna make me crave oxy? 

I want so bad to get high again. Thoughts, suggestions? 

Edit- So just for reference I've been taking pills off and on for 13 years, and was strung tf out for just over a year, ending about 2 months ago 

Edit- I didn't get kicked out of pain management,  when I got my settlement, I lost the insurance I was using, and just started buying all of my drugs. I want to get back in, but this time I'll have to go through Medicaid

heard your voice but couldn't tell that it was you.


And, slowly, watched your sickness slip away into a place that I'd once feared but I was not afraid this time


So I gave chase and found it, finally, slowly feeding from your head, And from my friends, and from my family, so I grabbed it by the neck.


""For every lover you have ruined..."" I dug my nails into its flesh.


""...and every life that you have taken...""


Slammed its head against the brick.


Its blood poured out onto the pavement,


I stirred it in with dirt and spit,


""I will take a part of you.""


I made mortar from the mix.


Tore every organ from its body, broke its bone and fashioned bricks, I laid the mortar in between,
I made a throne for hope to sit.


""Too long you've torn us into pieces,
firmly held onto our wrists. Today I bury you in me.""

I’m a heavy user, and I’m not trying to exaggerate or anything but every year it’s always the same stories when Xmas arrives my doses goes up too.  I had 3 shots of x3 8mg dilo and 2 full 36 hydros big red, even tempered the wash with more dilos. So yea I should be clinically dead right now, and yet I’m not even nodding (i did take 10mg Ritalin eArlier cuz I had a meeting and didn’t want to risk a nod cuz there was ex users there) and I know i have to slowly reduce my dosage but right now I just feel like I’m at the edge of the mountain and any wrong move could bring me face to face with mr. Death once again. I was thinking to just wait to see how long before I start getting WDs, then pop some subs and come back to the real world right in time for family reunion Xmas party. But I’ve never went from such a high dosage of ops then switching to subs. I have approx x50 8mg suboxones, so I was thinking maybe I start with 16mg sub, wait an hour and if cramps and sweating isnt stabilizing chew an other 8, wait and repeat process. I don’t want to get to an insane amount of sub tho because when I’m gona go back to my clinic in January the max they can give me is 36mg I think, so If my tolerance is higher then that I guess I’m fucked? One guy told me the last option I had was to switch to méthadone then just do the maintenance going down slowly but surely. What do you guys think? 

I’m also open to other kind of proposition like if you used to IV before and like me you can’t find any vein anymore, did you switch to snorting or plugging? What’s your opinion that’s why I posted this to hear people’s thought on my situation and find the best solution.

Probably not] yet I still trusted her more and felt comfortable giving her more money.,"I still trust Cliff's sister more than Cliff. Even after losing sixty bux through her. You see, I gave her $90, told her to keep $10 and spend the rest on subs. The following day she gives me two subs and says she'll get the rest the following morning. Then I'm told that she gave the money to the secondary sub connect but they didn't come back that day because of the snow. A day later I'm being told she'll have them 8am the net morning. That next day, she tells me in the afternoon that she missed the phone call from the person who was delivering subs due to her catching up on lost sleep.


&nbsp;

**Rewind**, last week...** Day one of dope binge on pay day. Nothing too grand, but a ""friend"" has the contacts for a connect or two so we place our order when he gets paid at 4AM. For once he fronts me dope til I get paid in the afternoon. Every time I cop dope with Cliff I say, ""we must get subs for when we run out!"" He assures me that he'll ""ask"" the dboy when he gets the dope. Well, after the dboy left I ask, and he says he forgot to ask. Good job.

&nbsp;


All I ever want to do when consuming dope is to be able to do it responsibly. I know I can't buy enough dope to last me until pay day so I have a choice, get subs or don't do dope so that I don't get sick. Every time I gave money to Cliff for subs, it would get spent elsewhere and I'd have to wait a week or more to get paid back. 


During the most recent pay day, we got paid on the same day. Cliff ordered the dope in the morning and I paid him for it in the afternoon. From there, **I gave him $40 for subs and told him ten different ways that I wanted it back if he couldn't get subs.** He assured me that wouldn't be a problem. Said that he had just gotten three grand in his account and added that him and his mom just spent $400 on groceries. 

&nbsp;

The following day his sub connect is nowhere to be found. His sub connect was also the dboy that he didn't buy dope from this week because someone else guaranteed early delivery. So his dboy/sub connect was likely not motivated since we didn't give him profitable business.

Logically, I didn't think Cliff would succeed in getting subs from his connect anyway because he usually fails to get subs.

&nbsp;

I proposed getting subs through his  sister. Personally I she has a much better track record than Cliff and Cliffs ""friends""(imaginary) when it comes to getting subs. First I needed to get my $40 back from cliff so that I can buy subs. **Had to spend a few minutes verbally wrestling my money out of his pockets**, by then he decided to cough up $40 more of his own money for subs. As stated earlier, it didn't work out so well. The following day Cliff is saying, ""you're not going to bed tomorrow unless you have the money or subs."" Fuck that I said, unfair. He can wait two days since in the past he often makes me wait much longer.

&nbsp;

Fast forward to Tuesday afternoon:
**A change of luck, sort of.** Through one of my fairly legit hustles I earned $20 so I said fuck it, I'm a gambling man. I went to Cliff's sister and asked her to order two more subs. Despite sitting in her house for two hours on Sunday being told, ""20 minutes"", ""the guy is in traffic then making a stop then coming here"", etc. Either she was getting plaiyed, or she was playing me. Either she was calling this connect on the phone saying ""where you at"" or pretending to make such phone calls in front of me. Who knows. I even was told she'd get me some subs 100% on monday night but the following day she levelled with me that she was trying to get money to get me subs. Although I'm not sure if she pocketed my $60 last week or gave it to a connect who ""never came back"" is unknown.


**What I do know is, despite feeling highly suspicious of her, I still feel more comfortable giving my money to her instead of Cliff to get subs.**

She assures me she'll pay me back for the previously lost money. If she isn't lying, I wouldn't want her to pay me back the full amount because she took the risk while doing me a favor. On the other hand, she's probably guilty and maybe legitimately wants to pay me back but needed the $60 that she ""lost"" at the time.

&nbsp;

I'm willing to chalk it up as a lesson learned. I get paid a couple of days after Christmas and should probably just not get any fucking dope. Just end this here. Cliff probably gets paid after my pay day so if I want dope he'll expect me to front for him. As it stands right now I only owe him $40 since that's how much he invested that was ""lost"" by his sister.

&nbsp;

So anyway, upon spending $20, Cliff's sister did manage to get two more subs. Perfect timing since I just consumed the last 1mg square today that was remaining from one of the two subs I got last friday. Of those two subs last week, I gave one to Cliff. He finished his sub in less than two days. I think he took some to get sleep on Sunday and the other half on Monday. Cliff refuses to take less than 4mg of subs at a time like I advise him to for conservation sake. He did swallow an oxy (instead of snorting) last week by my recommendation though and he said it lasted longer.

&nbsp;


I owe Cliff $40 or his sister owes him $40 since she was my middle and I was Cliff's middle for subs. Anyway, I basically owe him $40 since he gave it to me to buy him subs. **Should I share one of the two subs that currently have in my posession?** I can easily get five days out of a sub, Cliff can only get two days out of a sub. It feels like such a waste for me to give him a whole sub and I rather just play his game and pay him his $40 next when it's convenient for me instead of giving him a sub now and owing him $10 less.


I figure I'll give him his $40 next week, he could buy half a bun for himself and I can clock out of the doing dope game because I'm sick and tired of running out of money and being taken advantage of. After over a year of this shit I just want to end it here and now. 

&nbsp;

P.S. - Cliff is and always has been an alias.

P.P.S.--**Cliff and his sister are by no means in collusion.** They hardly talk to each other and dislike each-other very much. There is some truth that Cliff can't take a favor from his sister because she wouldn't let him live it down.

Bottom line, in no uncertain terms. They do not get along. It is more likely that she spent my money and most certainly did not give subs directly to Cliff. ",1513755314.0

   Watching the news after Hurricane Katrina was both horrifying and enlightening for me. The enlightening part was when I saw some people walking out of a pharmacy with a big container that had RX on it and the light bulb in my head went off. I knew that I wanted to use the next natural disaster in my favor to get a little bit of free “healthcare”.  My opportunity arrived in 2008 in the form of hurricane gustav. The storm came through and did some pretty substantial damage to the town I was living it at the time, including power outages in the whole town. 

   So, the night after the storm passed I got dressed up in all camo and carefully made my way to the pharmacy that I had scoped out, crowbar and duffel bag in hand. I pried the door open and was able to get in and out in less than about 8 minutes, but in that time I was about to grab at least 3500 or more of every kind of pain killer you can imagine, except of course Oxy and roxy(☹️). Still a very good haul and even better was that I kept about 1/4 of the haul and sold the rest for the easiest $14500 I have ever and will ever make.

That said, and it's probably why I haven't been around in a while, I miss that small town feel. lol, not that I know what a small town is but the sub had a kind of neighborhood thing going on. 
   
Either way, pretty wild, interesting correlation with more widespread use in America, not that it wasn't there before but there's obviously a parallel.   
   
I looked around for a few of the old timers and usually can't find any of us. Which probably also says something.

It's about the early years of the AIDS crisis (the beginning through 1985).  I studied history in college and this era of history is not yet discussed really, so I only knew some of the most basic things about the early years--but I can clearly see how the hysteria affected the education I received about AIDS in public school even 10-15 years later.

It's really helped me understand more parallels between the two epidemics than just the death rates (2016 was similar to 1985 in terms of death rates--it just affected different populations of people, and the deaths were sudden vs drawn out).  Plus the hysteria--things like the article the other day about the cops not wanting to touch people, wearing HazMat suits, out of their fear of fentanyl.  Straight out of 1983--nurses refusing to treat AIDS patients and cops doing things like that for fear of contracting the disease through contact (since the virus had not yet been found).

Beyond that, it's the indifference of society that led to the epidemics becoming more deadly than they needed to be or could have been.  And the incredible caring and bravery of some people on the front lines of the crisis--in the 80s it was the doctors looking for the cause and caring for the victims--now it's the people who led the fight for methadone access then syringe access and now supervised injection facilities and more.

The little things as well--like obituaries that never say ""AIDS""--just like obituaries for overdoses rarely use that word now.  Though there is a movement, just like there was in the later-80s, to honor people by naming what happened to them and using it to help the community.

I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes reading and is curious about some of the intricacies of public policy and how things happen as they do.  It's a non-fiction book but it's incredibly moving and a great story.",1513743137.0

So my friend normally middles for me. We get some decent tar regularly. 

Anyways, this time he picks it up just like normal (so I think) and drops mine to me. He says to let him know what I think, as he did something different this time.  My ROA is smoking. So I get the new batch and proceed to try it out. It’s extremely harsh and dry tasting. Totally lacks that sweet note that I’m used to, runs like shit, and burns super quick. Some areas of the big chunk seem ok, but the majority tastes like total ass. I know something is different so I ask him what the fuck is up with the batch. 

Apparently, now that we’ve gotten in good with out guy he will sell us the stronger stuff he gets that he cuts himself for resale. So my buddy gets the great idea to buy this and have the guy show him how to cut it so we can get more of what should be stronger stuff. Naturally he tries to do this for the first time while fucked up, and fucks up the whole batch. Which is why the stuff i now have tastes and burns like dog shit. 

I know there is good product in it. Does anyone have a recommendation as to how I can either redistribute the cut that he added to make it more uniform, or remove the cut entirely? 

My only though was to put a minimal amount of water to turn it all to liquid, then blend the hell out of it and somehow evaporate the liquid out of it. Is anything like this possible?",1513738782.0

So I copped and he came over. 

Asked what I was going to do in my shot and I said .2 so he said alright I’ll do the same. I’m pretty high feeling good and he’s pretty fucked up also feeling good. I see him weighing more shit out and I’m like what are you gonna do? He said .17 so I told him straight up dude you’re already really fucked up do not do another shot that big right away. He tells me to chill and that he’s going to split it into 3 shots. 

So he takes another one and goes out to my living room. I’m in my room cleaning up and making my bed. I call out telling him I want to go to the store to get some snacks and asking if he wants to come. No reply. So I call out his name. No reply. So I open my door and go out in my living room and he’s face down on the floor. Slightly convulsing, eyes open, and he’s turning blue/gray. 

I freak the fuck out and run to my room to grab the Narcan. In my panic I break the first needle so I grab the other one and the vial and run back out. I fill up the first vial and hit him right in the ass with it. No change, no response. So I run back to my room to grab the other vial while calling 911. Hit him with the other shot while waiting to get through. I get through and tell them my address and to fucking hurry. I haul him up and lay him on his left side checking his breathing which is shallow but he’s breathing again. 

After a few minutes he starts to come around and sits up cradling his head still completely out of it. Then he comes to and asks what’s going on. I tell him he just OD’d and that the ambulance is on it’s way. He refuses to believe me and keeps saying he’s fine. I tell him bullshit you were face down turning blue and I had to hit you with Narcan twice. 

At this point he starts freaking out talking about cops and how he can’t be there. “Why would you do that? Why would you call 911?” I immediately was like fuck you man you were dying and not responding to the Narcan. The cops aren’t/can’t do anything to get you in trouble. 

Post is getting long so I’ll wrap it up. EMTs, Fire and Rescue, and PD show up. He refuses to go to the ER or get in an ambulance. I go out to smoke and when I come back the EMTs tell me that now that he’s conscious and coherent they can’t force him to go to the hospital. They gave me more Narcan (which they weren’t supposed to do) and told me to keep an eye on him. They made me feel a lot better by saying “You did everything right and you honestly saved his life tonight. Good on you for not being afraid to call and if he goes back down don’t hesitate to call again.”

Go back inside and he just starts freaking out on me telling me that he was fine and how could I do that to him. Why would I do that to him. I showed him all the shit he knocked over and was like look at your ass dude. I stuck a 2 inch needle in it twice with two doses and you weren’t responding. He tells me to go fuck myself and asks where the rest of his shit was. I told him I wasn’t giving it to him and it just deteriorated from there. 

I know that I did the right thing 100% but it just feels really shitty that he reacted the way he did and has no appreciation or gratitude for me saving his fucking life. Especially after he lied to me about splitting that shot into 3. Idk just needed to vent. Thanks for reading my novel. ",1513738755.0

I'm 28 and have been on drugs since 13. Addicted to sniffing dope since 17 (walked across the state at graduation strung out - $6k in grad present money gone in 3 weeks). Started IVing into my first (and only) year of college. About ten years later let me tell you a couple of things.

I come from a great family and could have had anything I wanted. Upper middle class, no trust funds n all that, but my divorced parents between the two of them prob pulled in close to a million a year between the 2 of them. I was an only child until my step mom had a ""surprise"" baby when I was 16. I was told it was a surprise but really they wanted a do over because they figured id be dead soon.

Speaking of death. 90% of my buddies I started using with in high school are dead. I'm talking my best friends, friends since middle school and before, my fam. My cousin died in a gas station bathroom a couple of years ago. Well he died in the hospital a couple oItdys later his brain never recovered but his head did swell up like a basketball and it made it harder on my aunt bc she had to pull the plug since he wasn't DOA. The cherry on top is that most of these guys who died left behind a toddler or two. Two of my best surviving friends at the time played guitar and sang at this bar for my cousins memorial a couple of weeks after he passed, ""chunk of coal"" and ""wish you were here"" - they were both dead themselves with in the next 6 months.

I used to be a big fan of the junkie dealer lifestyle. I liked money. Free drugs. Girls. ""Power"". The image. Feeling like I was getting over on society somehow. Maybe I was just lazy and it was a quick buck. After I dropped out of college and started using full fucking time I sold shit in varying degrees of quantity, in whatever city I was in at the time. Its all fun and games until a couple custies die and the paranoia kicks in.

Oh yeah and jail is awesome too.

I don't really know where I'm going with this other than i was thinking earlier about my sister. I texted my step Mom last week asking her what she was getting her for Xmas and she said she had just ordered her a set of pjs off Amazon for her from me. Them knowing I couldn't afford it. My girl and me may exchange TiNY baby gifts this year but I think this is the first year I won't be getting a single present from anyone. My sis on Xmas is gonna ask me what all I got and Im gonna have to lie bc she's gonna think it's weird I didn't get shit. 

Yes I have a million crazy tragic stories but the bottom line is if you are just starting out take my advice. You are young. You think You are smart and your figuring shit out but you are wrong. You are actually pretty stupid. Sure the drugs feel good now but you are gonna have to pay eventually . atleast in my circles the druggies didn't magically clean up and get their lives together. Id say out of 30 hard drug users 15 are dead 5 are in prison the others are scattered all over trying to get clean or acting like they are or getting their new job at Wendy's at 30 while their two kids live with their in laws.

At some point my use changed and I NEEDED opiates. The high didn't matter. Without opiates even being clean for months at a time I don't feel right anymore. And I've dug such a hole I mean....this is who I am and what i do. I wake up feeling like shit. I break my back for enough money to not be wding and considering dying. I don't get excited anymore about my shot I just know I have to do it. I know this probably won't ever change.

I've asked friends and family for help and they all said fuck me. To most of my friends I was just a middle man to supply there habit they never paid me and I never asked. My families a bunch of greedy assholes I never expected them to help in the first place lol. 

I got pulled over yesterday and told the cop I was homeless he let me go with a warning and told me to get out of his city. I keep fishing for something to stay positive about but my health is shit, my finances are shit, my bellies empty, and the thought of freezing in this fucking car another night is really affecting my positivity.

I tried to leave and he told me that I wasn't going anywhere. He told me if I didn't tell him what I was doing he was going to call city police. Eventually I admitted it, he made me show him the needle and told me I wasn't to dispose of it on the property. I showed him my ID but he didn't scan it. He commented that I was very young. He told me to be careful and that I could be arrested very easily if city police were to see me. Eventually he unblocked me while talking to another officer or security guard in blue and let me leave. I don't know if the guy in blue was a cop or another security guard.

My question is what is the worst that can happen to me? Is it illegal to be on camera shooting up?

I had to take a speedy to get money to grab from my asshole of a dboy who cut his shit too much (although it was still pretty good), made me wait hours daily, and was just a general ass who shorted me all the time and wouldn't do anything less than $100 at a time. 

So the driver and I get talking, sure enough she's an addict too. She tells me about a girl who's literally a three minute walk from me that never makes you wait, and doesn't cut her shit. I was down and cancelled on the other guy, within 10 minutes we'd picked up and I was back at my house with more than I paid for! It was great! I was truly blessed that day, I've grabbed off her everyday since and her shit is always awesome, and I've seen her grab it from her guy and literally take mine out and hand it to me. She weighs it infront of you so you know it's good, and she's honestly a great person. When I went to grab last night she could see I was sick (we played phone tag all day) and she invited me in & I hung out with her & her guy and got high for about an hour before going home.

The best part is how close she is, she has no minimum, she'll do a half point if you want her to, and she genuinely cares about the people she sells Tom She's not out to screw anyone over, she's just a really genuine person and so is her boyfriend. When I left last night she mentioned we needed to hang out again soon & I walked home happy that it was a stress free situation (the opposite of what it is with my other dealer). Also, everytime I've grabbed she's given me at least a half point extra! Its been great! A Christmas miracle!",1513864313.0

If so, I'd suggest refraining every now and then. 

Why? Because of neurobiology, that's why. Specifically, your brain begins essentially to produce antidote to a drug before the time it usually experiences the drug. So if you eat a grapefruit 30 minutes before you take an oxy every time you eat a grapefruit and take an oxy, your brain knows 30 minutes ahead of time that you are going to take an oxy, and so it begins to work to counteract the effect. 

The idea here is to confuse your brain; to take away the normal course of events and do something unexpected, so that no molecules are floating around inside you that will prevent you from getting the full effects.",1513856998.0

I've done this suboxone taper thing aka cutting the dose by a little every 4-5 days untill I hit 0. And compared to cold turkey yes it is a bit more drawn out but in comparison to cold turkey its a walk in the park. At the end of the taper i still seem to relapse but it took me a few months where with ct about a month or less -_- 

When you hit 0mg however expect to feel lethargic, some anxiety & Insomnia. However nothing in comparison to cold turkey. If it's really bothering you I bought a valiums or long acting benzo ( just don't get addicted to these Aka only use for when wd is bad) and a nice indica strain of weed along with some days off work. That and going for a run or long brisk walk. Or gym if that's more your thing. 

Anyways.... The title says it all.
How long do you keep your suboxone under your tounge? 
Also I can't seem to find some solid scientific evidence or even manufacturers advice online :/ 
Do you know of any? Is there a set time for each dose if you know?

I know they say till it's dissolved. But for the 2mg I'm at right now I can't look under my tounge around 5 mins in as spit runs out. But when I have made the mistake I can still seem the Suboxone there. Somewhat dissolved of course.

All of it, I've been here!

That's why I wanna share this with you guys, even though the two are totally unrelated. One thing's for sure -- we all hate rude, inconsiderate bitches.

Ok so I'm in graduate school. We had a presentation for one class, where we broke off in groups.

OK so one had a suggestion to bring in stuff to pass out. I was very much against because in undergraduate the PHD-level instructor with decade-plus experience in media as a journalist told us to never pass anything out unless you're done with the speech. He followed that rule in class too.

One girl in group of 4 people total suggested bringing in mcdonalds for people -- speech about supply chain or something, in no way related to MCD's greasy quasi-goodness -- which I was against. 

So girl brings in MCD for the presentation, like a biiiiiig bag's worth of burgers or something. Not many people in our class of 10-13 people -- only half class there that day for speech -- even ate them. So there is a shit ton of these burgers left, that very few people ate. and hell I didn't even have any. 

At the end of the class, girl left them in hallway for others to eat. I dipped about 15 minutes after everybody left... burgers still sitting there... way over half the bag left. Like so wasteful, none of the people in the group had any utility for them.... Whatever.

In the class immediately following presentation, that girl asked me to contribute $5 to those burgers... Same day as speech -- not even asking me before hand, none of that. Just assuming I wanted to help out -- coming from the person who staunchly went against handing anything at all out before speeches in hopes of keeping their attention -- when... OK, we get how out of place her asking is.

Girl wasn't the most friendly person, even before asking me for the reimbursement. So, today, about 1.5 or 2 months after presentation date, I email her and ask how I can pay her back.

She suggests PayPal, I tell her I don't have it -- I do lol -- so I'm now asking for mailing address.

If I get that mailing address, guess what I already have folded up, return address'd up, stamp'd up, in an envelope?

Usually the process is anxiety when your sick and pure bliss when you pickup. However when I randomly get a sudden, consistent influx of cash and start allowing myself to dose more often and more heavier, I notice a point of diminishing return that eventually leads to pure anxiety in between my shots and only very brief relief after I dose. And I mean going from like .3 IV 3 Times a day to 1.5 g ~7 times a day. I do notice my ability to feel okay on my own reduced greatly as I had the luxury to do a shot every time I watched someone stub their toe, let alone go thru anything really myself. So i do factor some mental dependence but my panic attacks feel like a physiological issue rather than pure psychological. My panic attacks consist of inability to catch my breath, then uncontrollable feeling of something is causing me to die, followed by a fear of it continuing or happening again(which then leads to another one). Any of you guys go through this or have an idea what’s going on or how to deal with it without resorting to anti anxiolytics? It’s just confusing having something give you relief from anxiety to such an absolute extent and then see that start to do the exact opposite so much so I choose to cold turkey my way out of that situation and let my tolerance to refresh after a week of no use.

I decided not to call ambulance in a what seems to be pseudo-OD (that at first looked as an OD) like situation, but hear me out why...

EDIT: Sorry for the alert, the situation seems to be resolved and she's ok. But you can still read through the post as she got in a really strange state after receiving a tiny dose of IV methadone which I've never seen and at the beginning mistook it for OD (and therefore wanted to call the amberlamps). I've detailed the progress of the weird state she went into.

I gave my gf (she's a tolerant h user, IV) some wash-outs from a spoon and one piece of cotton. But like 20 mins before that I gave her last shot of 3 shots total (very little amount for her - 5 mins after the 3rd shot she complained not feeling anything). So she looking semi-sober (I admit, I used the most of the substances and left her little being the greedy fuck I am) asks me to at least IV her with the spoon and cotton wash-out. And now, after the IV, she has been in total 20 minutes in this strange state - she's breathing, but she's at the same time convulsing a bit (that stopped after 10 minutes, now sleeping it off, as it seems). She can (could) answer certain questions with ""naay"" or ""yaay"" kind of sounds and showed some kind of cognition levels. I asked her if she felt bad and should I call the docs, but the answers sounded like ""no, don't, I'm ok"". I was quite certain, at least about the feeling not that bad part. She's was just rolling in my bed slowly t:+15mins - changing poses of her being rolled, lying straight and just looking and sounding like she's heavily sedated and just sleeping. And now after t:+20 mins of her last IV she's seems to be lying still, breathing irregularly, but the interval of breaths is good, they're often. Looking like a typical junkie that took a little much, but didn't OD.

When I see an OD I usually call the docs as soon as I can and therefore I've saved her and others many times. But this time I feel that this will pass as she breaths, she's doesn't look noticeably bluish or troubled breathing, she's just being really incomprehensive. 
Now she calmed down and seems to be snoozing it off. 

What do you think about her HARDCORE reaction to the spoon and cotton wash-offs? Substances: possible fent and IV methadon. They usually all start working as soon as you IV them as usually most of IV opiates do. So I've never seen anything like this in my 7 year IV h (and fent) addict.

EDIT: Sorry for the alarm. I woke her t:+30 mins after her last dose and she responded clearly (yet being still heavily sedated) that she's fine. Pheeew. I asked did she feel bad when those spasms happened and she slurred ""yes"" or something, but I think she didn't understand the question as her eyes were rolling in different directions. Put her back to sleep. Now she's a lot calmer, regular deep breaths. And part of cognition seems to have returned. WTF, all that from a washed spoon and cotton, a piece of it!",1513808110.0

But I feel my heart beating weird which makes me more paranoid etc. etc...

This actually happened to me with weed too (well not that I would OD, but I would start getting crazy anxious) about the same amount of time after I was heavily smoking. That also started out of nowhere until I just quit weed.

We've been partying and experiencing new things together for years. Yes we enable each other but none is anymore responsible than the other. We're both almost 30 years old and have been responsibly having fun for a long time. 

Well recently he split with his girl and had to stay with his mom for a while. His mom finds out he gets high and instantly blames me even though she's been my second mother most of my life. So she kicks him out and he goes to stay with his sister 3 hours away. His sister is a good 4 years younger than him. Well a few days ago they somehow found a couple of his pills and flipped out. They took his phone and went through all of his texts and also hacked his Facebook. They search him every time he walks in the house. Hell they even search him before they'll let him in the car. It's insane. 

Then they called his mom and she goes crazy and called the sheriffs department on me and gave them all of my info and told them that I'm a major drug dealer and I'm ruining her sons life. Funny thing is, when we started doing opiates, HE is the one who found pills first and HE is the one who introduced me to the dope man. He's tried to tell them this but they don't believe him and literally think I'm the plug. I don't know what to do at this point. I'm pretty sure it's illegal to hack into someone's Facebook account without permission. Although we don't talk through fb, our first dope man lost his phone for a while and he has messages on there. Honestly the only legal evidence they have is hearsay so I don't think I should worry but if anyone has any thoughts I'd appreciate them. This is so fucked up. ",1513801653.0

I consumed between 0.15-0.2g of heroin on Monday night between 8:00 p.m. to 12:00 a.m. The purity is questionable, it's relatively good but definitely cut with something. My ingestion method was intranasal. Additionally I used throughout the weekend and consumed a little under a gram.

I am on probation currently and test randomly throughout the week (please spare me the ""Why did you use if you knew you could be tested?"" comments, I know, I know). I test tomorrow. Around the time I will need to drop, between 60 and 64 hours will have passed. I understand that it takes between 2-4 days on average for all of its metabolites to completely clear one's system and I have passed before at the three day mark.

I've been drinking a lot of water and green tea, and I have a very high base metabolism, which has saved me multiple times before in these kinds of situations (knock on wood).

Since the elimination half-life of morphine is between 2-4 hours, I was curious to see if I would pass a test with a cut off of 2,000 ng/mL (my probation's cut off level is 300 ng/mL). My rationale was that if half of the quantity is being eliminated each 2-3 hours, I would be below 2,000 ng/mL at the 34 hour mark. Thankfully I passed, which leads me to believe that tomorrow, I should be well below 300 by the time I test.

Can anyone check my understanding on this? Any advice would be appreciated, even if it's just that I'm better of telling my case manager that I will fail.",1513801573.0

Then Another Half of a half around lunch time, half of a half for the drive home and finally a last half of a half when I get home.

Wife and family don't know i'm using so I don't have much of a support system. The only person that knows is ironically my boss, and my dboy who also is my best friend of 15 years.

I have heard its best to start tapering your use to avoid that sudden WD. 

What is the best way to start tapering? I know going CT is not an option for me because while not a huge habit, I still feel like shit in the morning sometimes. Kratom, some Aleve, and a bowl helps.

I had said a few days before that my next buy would be either 200 or 300 worth. Will fast forward to the trade I only had 200 (I told him this on the way there) and he goes well the bag is a little heavier so you owe me 50 okay? I had no problems with this... but then after some excitement over losing his dog to a mall employee in a wheelchair (a story for another time...) he was hurriedly loading his doggo back into the truck and taking off when he shouts back ""Don't forget you owe me money!! Actually that bag was really heavy, you owe me 100... no 150! Okay see you next time"" now I'm just sitting there stunned like what just happened lol. I didn't have a scale on me, but I really doubt it was 150 worth extra.


I had told him I would pay him back on my next payday so I had some free days of picking up like usual, but then eventually the day rolls around and he's saying okay so you owe me 150 oh and 40 for that other time!! You remember? (No I do not remember Mr. Dman...) In addition to this he had been saying he could give me one of his winter coats because he had tons. Originally this was going to be a free hand-me-down and it turned into me buying his $100 shoplifted coat (I saw it with the security clip and tags still on and everything haha). So all of a sudden I owe him just shy of three hundo plus whatever I want to buy for myself this time. I ended up just ducking his calls because this would have wiped out my paycheque way too quickly and I needed it for other non-dope things.


I wasn't planning to ever deal with him again because I kind of felt like he was trying to bully me around until I found out from one of his street level guys (I was buying from him and he was like ""dude why aren't you just buying from <boss>?"" ) I am one of literally only like 3-5 people that he will deal with personally. He even let's me come to his house, see his family, etc. So I'm thinking if this high level guy is treating me like this maybe it's worth keeping the connect you know? Fast forward to this morning and I had plenty of $$$ saved with enough to pay him back plus an order for the holidays. I just made up a story about my phone breaking and just got a new one with my old numbers imported. His early texts seemed reasonable so I optimistically called him and he is just PISSED. ""WTF dude I needed that money, now my girl is stranded in XXXX city and she is flipping out at me."" I was just kind of laughing because he had bragged to me about their combined habit of $5000 a month before so along with being high up in the chain why is my $300 so important???


Anyway, what would you guys do at this point? Vanish along with ""his"" money, or relinquish the dough to keep the dope flowing. Note that I have other connects, some with slightly better stuff even, but he is extremely convenient and available pretty much all the time - I believe his guy that he doesn't serve many others. Now despite such a large supposed front I've actually only been buying directly from him for about a month now. And with my old guy I used before I moved I had zero problems with paying back fronts because I understand the mutual respect they generate. With this new guy I am tempted to cut contact just to stop this chaos, the only thing is he seems genuinely dangerous compared to others I've dealt with. I looked up his court appearances and it is just overflowing, one of the worst probably being an assault along with ""threatening to kill someone"". However he doesn't know my real name or where I live and because he doesn't come to the street often (ever?) I'm not likely to run into him even if I have to cold cop. Also I'm in Canada so there is way less chance he owns a gun.


Sorry for the encyclopedia friends! He'll undoubtedly be blowing my phone up today looking for his girl's flight money while I think of what to do...


EDIT - Forgot to add important thing. On the call this morning he says ""I'll let you decide how much extra I get for being late"" I'm just sitting there thinking ""Hmmm after much deliberation I've decided zero extra!""

Now a father - Continues to fight the battle day in day out. He's not perfect, doesnt claim to be. Writes some pretty strong poems - and every once in a while he shares - I strongly beleive he will be able to help so many people through his expeirences and feelings. His words are strong, his feelings even stronger. His dream is to help as many people, specifically with addictions, as possible. Recovery home management, motivational speaking, counceling, or many more ways... However possible, however necessary. He knows he has a long way to go, but the distance doesnt matter, only the direction. I think this might just blow up help him understand how ""on the right track"" he really is. It has not been easy for him, but he fights every day has come a long way.  I beleive the future holds great things for this man. 

Through these videos you will get some idea of what he has been through.
His motivation in life is his Son, my nephew. No secret that this boy has given him strength to continue. 
He is not ashamed to admit, and in his words ""I'll stick with my green sack"". He has some little videos of his business operation as well. Massachusetts has given him the right to lawfully put his skills to work, and he has been able to get by. He has continued to claw his way out of dept and hopes to work and save enough to open a recovery home, the correct way...

His youtube channel has 27 videos at this time. I have copied links to the 5 videos of his poetry. Newest to oldest. If you start with the oldest, you can really see progress and change.
Many of the videos are of his son, and girlfriends daughter. You can clearly see how good of a father this man is. 
Also, some of his business operation. 

This latest video, ""Tribute to former EASTON football coach"", really hit me hard. In the first day, it received 600 views. When he told me this, it got me thinking.... About trying to get more eyes on it. I have come to my trusty friend, Reddit to see what the world things. 

Everything he says is true - feel free to AMA

I hope this helps someone, somewhere. 
If you connect with this, or if this touches you, please pass this on. Please like or subscribe to his youtube videos/account - help spread this love. 
I know for there are many people out there that might see this and think a bit differently. It might be so close to their situation, they might be able to understand something they never saw before. I have seen this happen - and it happens and helps more than you think. 
Spread the love. Spread the peace. Spread the happiness.

Due to my use of heroin since giving up the sober life in late September; my life has become unmanageable once again. I've nearly lost my apartment twice and most recently almost lost my amazing fiance to a batch of super potent ECP last week.

So, I'm hanging up the syringes and straws once again. This time I fully plan on leaving this chapter of my life behind in totality. It's time for me to look forward to an opiate free future with my fiance and our dog, Georgia. That's going to start tomorrow with another three month stint at some sort of rehab.

I don't want this to sound like a sob story

I love all you amazing people. And I wish you all long lives, safe drug usage, and no more dopesickeness.

i have been on it for like 8 months now, and was wondering where anyone else stands on the 'blocking endorphins that you naturally produce' argument.

i was in the military and loved working out, now when i work out, i just get nauseous, and whether that is linked to my second issue of my appetite being gone, or if vivitrol effected the way i receive pleasure from eating. also my sleep is highly interrupted and not restful, sometimes with gabapentin i sleep well. maybe vivitrol has effected that too.

Wanted to send love n share some hope,"**Sorry if this comes across as preaching! I just have seen a lot of posts about changing being hopeless, so I wanted to share some hope.**    
     
I used to spend a lot of time here, and wanted to give you all a shoutout and send some love. To some it may not seem like a lot, but it is for me. 67 days is the most time I have had sober since 2004. I was a ""functioning"" addict for 10+ years until I started smokin rock and usin the needle. Then shit went downhill faster than I ever could have imagined. This post isn't meant to preach, I just wanted to let others know breaking the cycle isn't impossible (like I thought it was.)      
     
How my life was... I was waking up wanting to blow my brains out every day. I had family set my window so it couldn't open past 6 in. cause I kept wanting to jump out. My relationships were bust, family shattered, vehicles totaled, my most prized and personal possessions pawned, and more. Every time I put a little time together and decided to go back out, I found new rock bottoms and even lower lows. It may sound strange, but I am grateful for having heroin at the time cause it allowed me to bandaid my pain long enough to make it to a point I could start fixing my life again and get to the point I am at now.    
    
I thought I could never be happy again or enjoy anything sober. I found that assumption, and many others like it, to be completely wrong. I am getting things back, forging real relationships, rekindling old ones, have a plan beyond my next high and more. I know it's not a lot of time, but compared to the other times I got sober, its quality time and my life is finally coming back together.     
    
No matter where you are, it's not the end. If you're still usin, please be safe. If anyone wants someone to talk to, I am here. Most importantly, keep your head up and know that when you're ready to move on (and if you were a hopeless junkie like me), you can do it to.    
    
Much love to my r/opiate fam. Stay safe out there.

Some background; 2 years of opiate use,  the first chunk heroin, (ecp) last 6-8 months suboxone. Iv all the way. (When I fuck up I don't dick around I suppose.)

I took this week off work to cold turkey, get through the worst of the twitching and chills and power through the rest with caffeine and sleep aides. I won't get into messy details but I didn't make it. I think one of the issues was that I was cutting my strips as I took it and I kept going bigger.  

So I went and bought a pill box and cut up half a strip into 14 little chunks of roughly the same size. I now have a pill box full of tiny suboxone strips dosed out for the next week.  I'll make the next ones slightly smaller and so on.  But I find it ridiculous that I'm having such issue with withdrawl on the tiny dose I'm on.  Seriously, one 8mg strip lasts almost 2 weeks.  

I know I should stop shooting it,  but I'm being lazy about figuring out sublingual dosage. I'll have to at some point, my veins are not happy campers. 

Please don't lecture me,  I got that enough at opiatesrecovery when I asked a simple question about sub withdrawl time lines. Lots of ""you've had your fun now pay the piper and stop whining"" but very little help.

I've been a steady opiate addict for around ten years now. Just some background info to sort of relate that my withdrawal is pretty serious when it happens. I currently IV hydromorphone 12mg every two to three hours. So here's my Story about my blessed situation. It might help someone else who IVs Hydromorph possibly. So I had just finished my 150th pill and settled into what I knew would be a nightmare withdrawal. I waited until about 6 hours after my last shot to take some sleeping pills to get rest since I knew I'd be up for the next few days. 6 hours later I wake up and realize the cottons I'd been using were all dried up in a single pile. I thought it couldn't hurt so I put 20 or so to soak in around 3ml of water. I was already in withdrawal so anything would help. Miny junkie blessing #1. It immediately set me right. I had weeks to go until I could get fresh pills so I made the rest of the cottons last about 48 hours.  I lay down again to wait for withdrawals to set in again. After around 96 hours of restless hell I get up and decide to try eat something. I'm in hell wishing I would just die already and my toe brushes by a small cardboard box where I had been scraping out the powder/filler that's left after you make your shot of hydromorph. I look inside and for whatever reason I had religiously dumped all 150 pills worth of the stuff leftover after you make your shot. I never dump that stuff out. I usually eat it after every injection. I'm kind of excited thing I might be able to add some water and filter out a shot or 2. At this stage my coordination was awful, my vision wasn't right, I couldn't do any sort of fine motor control type of movements so I dump half in a huge pill bottle, like 5 inches high and an inch and a half in diameter, then add enough water to cover it by and inch and a half so. When it all settled out there was over an inch of this stuff with an inch at least of water above the line of that settled out powder. I stir and shake it then filter out a full 2cc shot. It was like taking a regular shot. I was saved. Junkie Jesus had provided me with a huge amount of these dregs that were enough to completely set me right and since I spaced out the shots this time I had enough to get me to a fresh supply of pills. Sorry for this wall of text but I had to tell someone and I couldn't tell anyone I know. TL;DR - found a new supply that normally wouldn't be there. Got fixed up right.",1513906312.0

The first day they picked up the car they didn't have enough money for the whole down payment. His mom cam down in the old van and pleaded the disabled card to no avail. The following day his younger brother loaned them a sack of money to cover the down payment and they made off with a car.


Naturally, the car was eventually repoed less than a couple of years later. Cliff's brother was owed money for a long time, in fact still is. Cliff's mom used to occasionally borrow money from her younger son for the electric bill or other necessities and promise repayment based on lies pedaled by her older son, Cliff.

Before I got into opiates, I'd sit down in Cliff's living room to smoke a blunt while surfing the web. His mom would call from the other room and ask about various people.

* ""Did you call Tommy?"" - His bookie? No doubt Cliff said this guy was gonna drop off money.

* ""Did you see Brad yet?"" - A person who who Cliff told his mom he was getting money from for some kind of trade. Money that she probably was owed or needed to pay for food or utilities.

* ""Did you go to the store yet?"" Cliff would say NO, and she would say ""I need my medicine."" Most likely the Xanax he took and sold off or the second half of her roxy srcipt that he was ""keeping safe"".

* ""Did yo see Denny yet?"" - Another person who supposedly had money for Cliff... he might say the guy is coming at 9PM. His mom would check back at 10PM and he'd be like ""no, you're stressing me out."" Then she'd check at midnight and he'd say ""stop asking stupid questions.""

&nbsp; 

Cliff basically did the same stuff to me. In my case he would get half a bun, give me table scraps and say ""my friend is dropping off the rest at 9PM."" I'd show up at 10PM and wait till 1AM. For the whole weekend he would give me revised ETAs until he ultimately blamed his ""friend"" for the negative outcome.


Before I got into dope and before his car got repossessed, I needed a favor with a ride to another town. Basically I needed to pick up a very heavy computer so he was like ""no problem, I'll give you a ride on Tuesday morning."" I had to reschedule three times with the guy I was picking the machine up from. I almost didn't get it but luckily I had another more reliable friend who was willing to give me a ride.


In retrospect, maybe he was running low in pills. I know I've postponed plans based on my ""withdrawal schedule"". 

&nbsp;


Sometimes Cliff borrows from his mom's roxy script and says he'll replace it. So of course she'll be like ""did you see Chris yet?"" Chris being the nickname for the pill connect.


I've learned that Cliff would sometimes get me to give him money out of desperation when low in pills or dope and promise pay back a day or two later. Two days later nothing is happening because ""the pill connect is being a jerk and taking his time"". Then on pay day, all of a sudden that same pill connect is here at warp speed. 

&nbsp;


A while back a kid around the block had a fake $100 bill so him and Cliff decided to call the dboy and spend that $100. Fucking idiots. I told them that was the stupidest idea and the dboy told him it was fake right away. Didn't accuse him of giving him the fake money on purpose I think he knew. Junkies gonna junk. 


A week later, we ordered dope and were getting the runaround waiting. When the dope was finally delivered it was bunk. The funny part of that story is when the dboy said, ""I'll bring it to my tester""(the guy who tests his dope for him). What good is a tester if he's not testing the shit ahead of time. We sure waited long enough! lol


Of course the dboy said that the guy in the chain above him screwed him and yes I know our ""dboy"" is a middle. So as a result he wouldn't replace the dope for free but he did offer a discount on a future batch. Shortly thereafter he ghosted.

&nbsp;

Back to near recent time, he was supposed to get a used car from a friend. At one point he borrowed a car from a friend and pretended it was his own. His mom was getting pissed that she was cooped up inside so he had to do something so that he could drive her to the doctor, go to the store and just get some fresh air.

Eventually he pretended the car was parked around he block and used that as an excuse to not run errands. Then said something broke in the car and that the person who gave him the car was getting it fixed for WEEKS on end until eventually he made up some bullshit reason as to why he doesn't have the car that he never had.",1513889091.0

It was about many years ago but I was in prison serving a 5 year sentence. I only had a few months left so all was pretty good at the time. I had what we call a prison habit, I need about 0.1 #3 a day smoked to keep me well. Its not a big habit but enough to be sick nonetheless.

Its a tradition in Irish prisons to give people temporary release for Christmas with anything from just the day to a week back home at Christmas time and is given to people who are coming near the end of their sentence. As I only had a few months left, I did of course apply for it. I was cautious because when your locked up there is nothing worse than disappointment so you try keep your head inside by not having hope. My friends were more excited than me in all honesty because they knew I would come back ""fully loaded"" with enough dope and benzos to keep us going for the whole of january. There would even had been a little crack just for a treat. I would have needed something for the pain in my ass anyways having to rape myself getting all of that in and out.

I was doing a psychology degree though open university in the prison school as well and I got on really well with the Vice Principal. She loved me cause I was considered a bit of a no-hoper by the Officers so it made the school look good. Anyways she tells me that they put up a couple of names every year to recommend they get Christmas out and that its pretty much a guarantee when they do. All was looking great until the list of names came back and I wasnt on it. They dont give you a reason but it could have been that the Gardai (police) objected.

Now normally I would have Christmas all wrapped up so to speak. I would have 3 people going out to take visits for me just in case one of them got caught. I made sure I always had a nice sized bag of dope to get me though the depression of Christmas in Prison. You try to tell yourself its just another day but unless your made of fucking stone your going to have your head dragged outside and the pain of loss that comes with it. This year I had let it all slip because I bought into hope and now I was completely screwed.

About 5 days before Christmas the whole place dried up because everything is held back for Christmas. I was lying in my cell feeling the wds kicking in like the damn mule that they are while being tortured by some do-gooder lunatics who thought it was a good idea to be let into the prison after bang up to sing Christmas carols to a wing of 130 prisoners who wanted to chop their heads off, not for any other reason than it would stop them torturing us with fucking Christmas carols. At least they went home to sip on brandy in front of the fire and smugly tell whoever would listen how they brought joy to scum that was us.

Over the next few days a few people who I was friends with all had promised to help me out, a point here and a half g there. As grateful as I was because its prison unless its in your hand its as useless as the rent a cop fools that open and close gates for a job. Finally got to Christmas eve and I was sitting in my cell with a buddy of mine depressed to hell. Just about everyone's plans had gone to shit, never saw anything like it. One fool even put diesel in a petrol car so the visitor with the dope couldn't get up to the prison. The writing was on the wall, and it was bad. The crazy thing was the previous three years even if I hadn't organised my own there was plenty around so I would have been ok. This year everything was fucked.

It was 3;30pm and visits would be closed in a half hour so here it is Merry fucking Christmas. We were just sitting in the cell watching some shit on the TV, couldnt even talk to each other as the realization of the emotional torture for the next 48 hours was about to become a reality.

Next thing we hear ""REDZER! RED!"" being shouted from the gate at the bottom of the landing. My buddy Red popped out of his slouch with his eyes wide open and back straight looking like one of those Meercats. None of us said anything but we were both thinking exactly the same thing, he hopped up and flew out the door. I was sitting there for about a minute just praying ""please please just a point between us would get Christmas eve out of the way"". Red bounces back in the door and Ill never forget those words ""its an miracle,  A CHRISTMAS MIRACLE, A FUCKING OUNCE!"". I jumped up out my chair and the 2 of us swung each other around like we were doing a demented Irish jig. The fucking Joy surged though my sick bones.

After the obligatory grabbing the foil off a packet of mints and getting a nice quarter gram rolling I asked him what? who? how?.
It was a new guy who had just been transferred, he was a friend of Red from treatment some years before and I had included him on a quarter gram between the 3 of us a couple of times. His only instructions was that nobody except the 3 of us were to get any. Of course we scooped a gram each into cigarette papers which I felt bad about later because the guy gave me 2 grams later to have when we were banged up. Well I didn't feel that bad but I thought I should feel bad. We spent the next week nodding and have to say its up there with best Christmas ever.

Genuinely I wish everyone here who want to be stoned this Christmas gets it and anyone who doesn't enjoy being sober. Just remember miracles do happen... sometimes.",1513881437.0

I've been lurking for years. I had a question about use and leading a healthy lifestyle.

My DOC is Panda40 or rox30s. One of them (panda) usually last me 48hr. A 30mg roxy tho, will last me roughly half the day. 
I try to dose 10mg (panda) nasally, every 8-10hr. With drugs, it has never eaten alive my money, or possessions, etc, Ive always been extremely highly functioning.. not bragging, just explaining my situation for perspective. I actually have the opposite problem, I will only buy a very small amount at a time. 

How would you convince yourself to buy enough for the week as opposed to enough for 2 days? I always do this, and it annoys my dealer as he is also aware that I'm not exactly struggling, and we meet up a fairly good amount... I just feel so dumb finding myself spending more than 75-85$ at a time on drugs.. anytime i've spent over 250$, i immediately try to start making $ back. I just can't make myself spend over 250 on anything. I have this weird mental thing with it, I literally can't do it. I'm making an entire thread on how to convince myself to spend $ basically, haha...

Maybe being frugal has saved me from a crazy high tolerance or crazy epensive habit? I'm on my 10th year on this shit, and still can do 30mg of rox, or 10mg of panda at a time and be good for 8-10hr. I've always secretly felt the reason I can use this little and keep control is because anti-depressants never worked... I always wanted to off myself until I found opiates... then I became fairly successful on them. The most negative affects have been on certain relationships and some physical health.

Has anyone developed stomach issues? (Such as acid reflux or any problems from the long term constipation?.. I have only been sick like 3 or 4 times this decade, so my gut isn't exactly up to par. But I do force one out at least every other day.) 
And does anyone else get dental issues from this? I think getting dry mouth from using and snorting the stuff has cause a decent amount of damage. I'm curious how one would use and avoid snorting to save their nose some damage? And if anyone else has gained dental problems- not to hygiene- but to dry mouth? Any tips on maintaining my health would be appreciated. I don't want my nose to fall off and to be toothless at 40. I take care of myself and have the means too, yet i am still experiencing minor dental issues and nasal damage.. I know asking for a different route of administrating might be crossing the forum rules, i apologize if so, just curious if there is any other way to use other than snorting or poking?

I sincerely appreciate any advice. Thanks for reading. This is sort of a shit post...  I dno... Not may people I can talk to this about..Sorta writing off of the top of my head. Thanks again.

Sorry, this will be the last.

My heart rate speeds up super fast cuz I think I'm dying. I pull over and start walking around, google ""can I walk off a heroin overdose?"" Haha. Walk into a physical rehab place and sit in the waiting room in case I do start dying at least I'm kinda in a medical facility. The guy asks if I'm scheduled for an appointment and I say no, I'm just having an anxiety attack and need to sit down. He brings me some water and is super nice, so that helps calms me down but I still feel fuckin weird. Long story short: I felt like I was dying for about two hours after snorting half a line of boy. The one thing that made me skeptical that it was an OD the whole time is the fact that my heart rate was so jacked the whole time and I know that that's the opposite of what happens in an opiate od.

I am not new to opiates or benzos, I don't bang anything and have been using norcos and valiums mainly to keep me going during finals from addy and coke come downs. 

I know it's not the safest way to use pills but are there that many good reasons?  Anyways, finals are over now and I would like to cut back to my weed smoking dominant habit and quit daily hydro use. It could be worse i know, the other week I vomited after a line, cigarette, and coffee in the morning and took half a pill ad immediately felt better...I went about my day but today after 5 or so days later a very acute back pain woke me up around 3 AM and I thought my bed had been causing the pain so I ate 10mg of valium and did yoga. I tried laying on the hardwood for a while and eventually i think the pills kicked in and I feel blissful again.

This pretty standard for you all? I'm going home soon for break and I am not sure if buying more valiums instead of more norcos or morphines in effort to kick the opiates at least... 

maybe not kick but is this acute back pain gonna persist if i keep using?

Cuz damn these hydros have been amazing. I am able to be twice as productive as well as happy throughout my finals. Normally, the extreme doses of adderall with daily cocaine use leave me tweaky so i use benzos to counter the side-effects but those fog my brain like a mofo (better for partying)

but when i ate painkillers absolute mental clarity and a renewed passion in my work...tricky bastards

For the past 8 months or so I've been hitting my hands and wrists primarily, which CAN get extremely painful and stressful, but 8 times out of 10 only takes 1-3 tries before I register. This had been working just fine for me until the time came for my annual pain in the ass to come around to assault me again - cold. I cannot hit for shit in the cold. I'm a very thin female with very tiny veins, and when it's cold outside those little fuckers shrivel up and retreat, only to be brought to the surface by hot showers or some kind of exercise, which are not always possible. My arms are hard enough to hit in good weather, in the cold they're fucking impossible. 

Out of exasperation, I've taken to shooting up in my feet. There's some great veins down there, big ol ropes that I can usually register with 1 or 2 tries. I am extremely careful not to miss when I'm hitting my feet or ankles, as I have made this mistake before and holy shit did it hurt. Not something I want to go through again. What I'm wondering is: how come, despite my obsessive precautions, do I still get these histamine-reaction-like rashes in the areas of my foot I'm shooting up in? 

I register, untie, re-register, and depress the plunger slowly, registering again halfway through just to be sure I'm still in (even tho I would know right away if I were missing), and despite all this I'm still ending up with that splotchy, red lumpy rash that I get on my hands/arms when I miss a bit up there. This shit hurts WAY worse on my feet than it has ever hurt my hands or wrists, and the pain lingers for days at a time. Not to mention it itches with a fiery, burning wrath and that itch follows my vein halfway up my leg immediately after I hit. My ankles have been swollen for days since hitting there around last Thursday, and I know I didn't miss even a little. 

Does anyone know what might be causing this and is there anything I can do to prevent it? I know obviously I can hit somewhere else, and I'm trying to find some other spots, but if anyone has any advice for me in the meantime I would appreciate it a great deal...cause for now I'm walking with a pretty prominent limp. Feet are always a last resort, first I try my hands/wrists/arms, but lately those just haven't been accessible. It's really upsetting to start every damn day waking up sick, then spending however long repeatedly stabbing myself with a needle, bleeding everywhere, getting frustrated and sometimes crying and occasionally missing and making all the effort and pain for nothing.

Thanks y'all! Apologies if this is a dumb question, if anything I'm mostly curious as to why the rash/pain is happening...my guess is that when I stand back up after hitting, maybe some of the shot leaks out of the hole in my vein and reacts in the same way a miss would...? I dunno. Sorry 4 the wall, I've been banging coke tonight and this post is way longer than it should be. Hope everyone is having a good night. JJ bless u all.",1514019864.0

my lips are cold the right side of my body and face is numb and has that kind of balmy, electric, staticky feeling that you feel when you do whip its or that pass out game as kids.

i almost just fucking died. im alone in my room smoking dope and playing poker and next thing i know i'm waking up on my back from a very restful nap at 12:30am and it hits me.... i shouldnt be sleeping. wait a minute i was playing poker... wait a minute its friday.... why cant i feel my face.... wait a minute i cant feel the right side of my body my right hand and arm are cold/burning/tingly my ears are ringing, my head feels foggy and full and i feel like ive been huffing........

did I almost just fucking die from smoking tar? i still feel tingly and it feels like things are like.... wavy and kind of absurd like i just imagine having a stroke feels like. my lips are fucking burning and im freezing.... could i have just given myself brain damage? 


forgive me for typing strange and sounding stupid as fuck but i've been doing dope for years, smoking it primarily, and ive completely lost sight of any sort of OD risk with smoking and ive never gotten this close to falling out from smoking, or doing any ROA for that matter. i've only ever really gotten dangerously close to oding on stims or the coke side of a speedball, never dope or an opiate.


if theres anyone out there right now reading this i'd appreciate a shout out and any insight or similar experiences. i can just now feel the o2 go back into my bloodcells

edit: im thinking that this may be poisoning from  a non-dope-cutting agent in this dope? it's from a new dealer to me. typical professional mexican cartel setup though. it looks/smells/acts/burns just like good bth but it's got a kind-of-chemically-acrylic-like but-also-rotten-lactose-taste. maybe it's just more potent than anything i've ever gotten? it definitely kind of feels like i could have been..... poisoned....  (thats the point... i know but you know what im trying to mean).

could this be my first encounter with fent-laced bth, at least that I'm aware of? does it sound fenty?

edit: it feels like i got so high that i forgot to breath and then it dawned on me that that is essentially what an opiate overdose is. it feels like i just dozed off into a restful nap and then woke up from suffocating for an indeterminate amount of minutes.

<begin pure speculation> one thing i've noticed about this guys dope is that it doesnt keep me cozy warm relaxed high that i'm used to with heroin in the past and I become a kind of pissed off, dick, redosing fiend and smoke it non stop until its gone. 

i get really short attitute and kind of an asshole. and theres no real long last high to speak of. like right now i woke up from my ""nap"" and i'm pretty much just well and sober. 

our bth used to be safe from fucking fent y'all, they got around to the fucking tar. </speculation>

one last hypothesis I may have outside of overdose is a not-since-recurring symptom that I first experienced when I was smoking a wildly irresponsible amount of meth or meth-like-crystal substance out of shitty uncleaned lightbulbs in rapid succession a couple years ago that could have caused latent brain damage that this shit is triggering.

Vietnam cool, because heroine. I do some stuff here, and i am friend with pharmacy. Cool vietnam. I ride bike to Laos, Laos opium and heroine. Yuymm, but no! Sinking deeper again! Life look bleak when not having heroine. So I leave Laos, go japan, yay, they let me in this time, and there I learn to english teaching the whole month and one half I am there. I did not pass course, but I learn many engliush skills! But oh no, I'm back on the sweater dihydrocodeens and I taking a lot, making bad sweatys and bad sleepings. Now I am no more there, I head to india! In india, very spiritful, many good things. Yes, I now take shit medicine to stop ass water, but also it stop all the bad thing. It is loperamide. I take this and tramadol. I go into mountains and meet many babas and babus, and babalos in great ancient city on ganga river. I am swimming cold ganga and feeling full power 24 hour. I am meeting babas, and sometimes I have religion heroine with the babas, but not often. There I am smoking very much weeds and spiritful is alive and the sweet music that sounds from the very depths on my true and tortured soul the melody sounds uniquely familiar to what I imagine people call peace. Something ephemeral. I go to dessert and ride camel with crazy krew and we are doing drugs overnights in desert. I go to other dimension many time and I become sun king with my camel, Ramirez. We find treasure of the heart in dessert together and I go back to mountains to find girl I fall in loves her. She is cosmic fox and I like her pretty words and way she run around world. We fall in love in different ways, but she does not want and no do I, but one hour before taxi to airport she marry me, very beautiful. We say beautiful words.

Very spicy, but no burn ass water! Chile fresh, all food pureveg, good for soul. I vegetarian again! Very helpful!

In preparation is there a more efficient/better yielding way to Isopro~ extract the oxymorphone than the traditional bottom of the can method, or the way I've just began trying, using an oral syringe to filter/extract it? Understandably, I want to reduce waste as much as possible while yielding the most.   

Also, how can I make a more potent shot? Whenever I try to use more opana it seems to get too thick for the amount of water I am limited to for the chamber of my works. I am looking for a better rush, but of course if I have to split what I want to do into 2 separate shots it won't be nearly the same as if I wouldn't have had to split them. (Basically, I'm thinking since I'd already be high after shot 1 so a follow-up shot would more or less be wasted if my goal is simply the rush.)

They looked spot on bc I remember last time this middle took me to this plug they seemed off.  I thought they didn't dissolve in my stomach right or something that time bc I think I took 12 and didn't really feel shit. 


So since that day I've been dissolving my pills in a small cup of water and just drinking it.   That actually did help with the high a lot so I continued doing it.  Well we got these today and I had pretty much convinced myself that last time we copped from here the pills not working was just due to the pills not dissolving in my stomach.  Anyways, I dissolved 9 of these fuckers and drank them.  

Immediately, fucking immediately, knew the taste was off.  I drop the middle off and get back to my house (maybe 1 mile) and I'm tripping out.   The taste was terrible and it seemed to stick in my mouth.   I vomited not 5 minutes after getting there.  I vomited repeatedly for over an hour and was really fucking worried.. contemplated the hospital but I have an HSA with a wife and young kid.  I can't drain the money we have in that account over this.  I was not having any issues breathing and heart rate seemed fine but my stomach was straight LOSING it.  

I knew if my stomach was rejecting it that hard it couldn't be real hydrocodone.  My tummy loves that shit.  I started trying to drink water and before I could even swallow three times it was coming back up.  I was down for throwing all this shit up so I just kept drinking water and puking to basically rinse my stomach out. 

I text the middle, who I am pretty positive was not in on this, and tell her don't take hers.  She either takes a $10 fee or one pill of what you're getting if that's what she'd rather have.  These were fucking $8 a pop.  Stupid expensive I know, but still cheaper than $10 and she could have had that in cash bc I had it ready.  So I think she's innocent in this.

Anyways, I tell her and she's a lil skeptical but I straight up told her fucking do not take that pill.  I have a WAAAYY higher tolerance than she does.  She just had a baby so was clean for over 9 months and never had a large tolerance in the first place (just in case these had fent or whatever).  She text me later and said that someone else called her and said they were fake so she finally believed it for sure.  

Idk if these had fent in them or not.. I don't think so bc I felt nothing but nausea.. you would think you'd get that opiate feeling somewhere along the way.  I took all of them so I don't have any left to take a picture of but I'm thinking of taking one of those drug tests that tests for fent.

I've been taking pills for over 14 years and this is my first for sure experience with a fake pill.  Now that I know I'm pretty sure they were fake last time too.  Idk why they didn't make me sick af then but they did now... maybe they changed something.

Luckily I have some pot how to help with this nausea.

Be careful out there guys.  This was in a bum fuck rural middle American town where I have never seen or heard of a pressed fake.  You always get people trying to sell Tylenol as Lortab but not fake like this.


TL;DR - Got fake pills, puked them up, still feel like shit.

It's been going smoothly so far, except for this one little thing... 

So where I'm staying at right now there are two dogs, both of them between 1 and 2 years old (Ya know, people years) so they're fucking bonkers. When I'm in the house, they freak the fuck out if I walk from one room to the other and might have a seizure or something if they're not coming with me. On top of that they're always fighting each other when they're doing their thing where they follow me, it gets pretty fuckin savage honestly it's great. If they're not fighting while accompanying my 5-10 foot treks across this house, they get so jacked to be going somewhere with me that they race ahead of me and I trip on them. Oh and they tried to eat the bed and the home owners wooden deck outside. 

So that's my company most of the time. 

Here's the mishap. In my new room there's this kickass desk where I do all of my weighing and bagging. I have a little prop thing to stick my phone in so the flashlight can illuminate the work area and I can see every little speck of product. Sometimes I'm not being careful, sometimes I straight fuck up, sometimes the dogs knock me over, but I've spilled a good bit of my meth on the floor in front of the desk. I get the big chunks immediately and save little stuff for later, I don't like carpet scrounging it makes me hate myself that much more. These dogs will be battling each other around me while I do my thing at the desk. It wasn't until last night I realized part of what they've been doing since I got bulk. They scrounge around the carpet and sniff/lick up all my meth. 

They fucking for this shit you guys it's terrible. There won't be anything on the ground and they're both sucking their faces to the ground running along where it spills from the desk like a fucking lawnmower on... well meth. I was wondering where all of it went but I wasn't too worried because it's just spill on a carpet, but they've got recovering down to a T. They've been doing this for 3 or 4 days now and I just noticed last night. So here's the dilemma.

Day 5 of wd right now and I feel great all things considered, honestly. Basically just writing this if for any reason it’s to just write  it down somewhere so I can come back and read this. Don’t go back. 

Personally for me, when I know I’m going to go through withdrawal and mentally prepare for it like I have this time, It almost seems like I can start making my brain naturally reproduce the endorphins that have slowed, not at 100% but to an extent. 

The first 2 days I can easily recognize the ‘fake depression and anxiety’ (I call it ‘fake’ Bc I know I normally don’t experience those feelings) and brush it off. Unfortunately I can’t do much about the physical symptoms. RLS drives me insane I hate it the most alongside puking , but this time I went through WD after IV dope for 4 weeks and it has been the mildest WD I’ve ever had probably due to Kratom but also because I decided to do this and tapered down to a final dose of .075 in a 24h period. So hopped off at less than a point when I was up to .75-1g at the peak probably. The taper was pretty fast probably like over 7 days. Started Kratom next morning and I haven’t had ANY puking, diarrhea, my only symptoms have been mild RLS/insomnia which I can still normally sleep 4-6 hrs per night in spurts with gaba clonidine and Kratom. I’ve been tapering down my Kratom dose as well, today (day 5) im at 7g 2x a Day morning and before sleep. I started at 7g 4x a day like every 4-5 hours as needed. Gonna be off by day 7-10 tops. 

Aside from RLS, I really do hate the lethargy/lack of energy from WD Bc I’m a gym rat and that’s how I was able to previously have 1 1/2 years of clean time. So I got back in the gym on day 3 of WD but I’ve lost about at least 20 lbs of bulk muscle weight. I was pretty fuckin big and I need to get back to that. Probably gonna run a cycle and then cruise test long term because I’ve already been on and off gear (steroids, testosterone) the past two years as well. Haven’t been on test for at least 6mo now though. I fell into this addiction about the length of time my reddit account has been alive. 212 days. FUCK. That’s more than half a year I’ve thrown away. I’m only 22 years old. To anyone young that reads this, I promise you don’t want this life. The risk is not worth any reward one might be seeking. 

P.s. there is no reward. 

That’s how I like to see it. Before then I used occasionally but not dependent to not be sick. Still have never felt psychologically addicted to a substance, just enjoyed abusing it and using it for lengths of time. Happened with benzos before too those gave me 3 seizures from 3 separate WDs but luckily never fucked up my head like some people go through bad. Man I’m really forcing myself to focus on rebuilding reward pathways. This is the only way to beat this. Even though I may not feel the happiness from doing something, I make sure to do everything I can that I know should make me happy, and I tell myself “this is good, I need to do this, this makes me happy and promotes a good life, etc” so I’ll be back in the gym today forsure, I’m helping my dad do some errands, grocery shop, pick up the truck from the shop, go out to eat, take the RV back to storage, anything that I can that promotes a positive life. I’m hoping I had my ‘ah ha’ moment, this girl really wanted me to shoot her up but she didn’t tell me she was drunk and on xans already, and I hit her with .05 of decent quality stuff and she ended up falling out/ODing And I hit her with IM naloxone and then gave cpr and she started breathing and came to like 7-10 min? Later I’m not sure I have no perception of time for this incident. I made the cap from that syringe into a keychain to remind me to stay away. 

It’s so crazy how easily we justify putting a drug in our veins that we know we can so easily die from. And yet I’m sure there’s gonna be a day where I’m gonna think “damn, I could totally get high just today and continue being clean after.” I can’t do that though. I just got to wake up everyday and say “today, I am happy healthy and clean” cuz that’s all we can ever speak for right, is today. If you got this far then thanks for reading. I’m just writing down whatever I’m thinking so I can read this when I need to. 

Until next time. 
TLDR: RLS and lack of energy sucks ass. I’m a 22 yr old poly drug addict gym rat. 6 years of addiction. Kratom is killing about 70-80% of my wd symptoms. Killing someone and reviving them isn’t cool. You have to mentally and actively attack wd to beat it or it will win every time. Thx4reading. ",1513986284.0

I’m simply curious, for all the addicts that have been in and out of treatment, in and out of the rooms, or simply trying to get sober for awhile, how do you maintain a healthy will to live? 

My will and drive to live is low. I laugh. I smile. I have fun. I do heroin, when I can. I’m 20 and I’ve been in and out of treatment since high school. I joined the military to escape homelessness and now I’m in a position where I don’t shoot dope 24/7, but when I do, overdosing doesn’t seem like the end of the world. I’m not sure why my drive to live seems substantially lower than others. ",1513984617.0

Longest I’ve gone without was 2 months , and I was still having random dreams where I’d be doing Lines and in the dream I’d feel THAT feeling...the warm blanket coming over me. So realistic that I’d wake up looking for the drugs I thought I just had, sending me into horrible craving usually resulting in relapse.

The last 2 months I’ve attenpted to quit like 4 times. I fail after a week when I get money again. This Time though, i have to. I can’t sustain a $100-300/day habit. 

I’m barely paying bills, and if I continue my whole life will fall apart. I’ve tried using subs and dones for the first 4 days just to get through the worst of it, but it’s the mental aspect that seems like it will never change. Struggled with depression and anxiety since a kid. I have no extreme trauma or abuse stories, I had a good upbringing . My brain just loves opiates. I’ve given a 30mg kind of oxy to a friend who’d never tried them and he got less high than I did and I was doing 4 a day at that point.

Anyways, I got a last grab of 12 blue, 5 op 80s and 5 Valium yesterday, planning to have fun w the blues and then use the OP To do a 4 day taper.

I swallowed 2 blues and snorted one, then ate an 80. I’m barely high, like 4/10. I’m a small dude too. All I can think about is the impending doom of jumping off a 300mg/day habit when in the past the worst it’s been is max 200/day.

Physical wd is mostly over after 2 days for me bc I have such a fast metabolism, Ive never thrown up from WD before, just all the other symptoms. Throwing up would b the final thing to push me into making that drive to the ghetto...

Fuck man. I’m scared. Doesn’t help that I have to play it off as just a cold to my roomies and then a group of friends on Xmas 😞 any tips are extremely appreciated.

Indisputable heavyweight champ of bad drugs.

Last night, I looked up quite a few pieces about the worst drugs... Alcohol took home first place, heroin was a strong second in **all** things I found. 

You know, heroin feels the SAME -- more or less, it really does -- as pain pills. It really is sad that opioid painkillers are available in such abundance in the United States, or at least were, even though they equate to heroin. Just not as much of a stigma on them. Not too many people flinch at the mention of abusing pain pills. Bring up heroin? Yeah, you are the devil himself.

So, this leads me to ask you knowledgeable people here on r/o....

*Why do you think heroin is so bad, or why do you think others crown heroin as the number-one or number-two ""worst drug ever""?*

From what I gathered, Here's what makes heroin ""bad"":

High frequency of IV use, often resulting in unsafe injecting practices.

Heroin is obviously not regulated, only  outlawed, meaning purity is impossible to reasonably ascertain. There are also adulterants that are bad for the body.

This is a relatively new phenomenon -- at least in terms of how damn popular this bullshit is now -- but fentanyl can easily be found in street heroin, potentially causing near-instant death. 

I know that heroin addicts can have bad hygiene and just get so lazy they don't really contribute to work and stuff -- and maybe even just sit in bed all day... IDK about this last part, was just what I read.

Why do you guys think heroin is so ""bad"" for its users? It's so much like pain pills, outside of its illegal status, life's-like-a-box-of-chocolates effect (never know what u gonna get in a bag),and tendency to IV it over and over again -- word to Nelly and Tim McGraw.

Considering i'll be high. but am I technically even ""high"" since Im an addict and just using at this point so Im not sick? Whatever the case may be, I will not be ""clean and sober"" on Christmas, but i'll be putting up a good front. 

Ive always hated the holidays, especially Christmas. Its always been a shit day for me. no presents, no nice family dinners, no tree. My mom might have sucked in the Christmas cheer department, but my dad always made sure to enjoy the holidays. He'd get a big tree, decorate it altogether as a family, make sure there were tons and tons of gifts, have a nice family dinner, and make sure everyone was happy. This is my first Christmas without my dad and it sucks. But on the bright side, my mom has changed a whole lot and has become an actual mother figure and seems to be much happier. 

Fast forward to high school, I don't remember much. as much as Id like to blame it on the fact that maybe my Christmas' were never rememberable, Ive probably just fried my brain.  

Fast forward to ages 16-19 I was struggling. This is when my heroin addiction started becoming a real problem for me and everyone in my life. I don't remember much. Don't know where I was for the holidays or who I was with. I did spent a Christmas or 2 or 3 in rehab, along with a few Thanksgivings. 

Fast forward to 20-22, I was pretty much homeless. Hopping from a friends house, to a hotel, to my car. I remember sleeping in my car in the middle of winter with snow on the ground! Being ice cold with one small blanket, waking up with frostbite, contemplating how to get my morning fix. 

Fast forward to the last few Christmas', they have all been a total bust. 3 years ago, I was stuck in a hotel room, alone, no family, no gifts, no cards, no dinner, hell, not even a ""Merry Christmas"" phone call or text. The Christmas after that, I was living in what I guess you could call a ""trap house"" - no heat, no electricity, no running water. Just a few mattresses and a couch. Just a place to lay my head at night and get by. Again, no family, no gifts, no tree, no cards, not even a text or phone call. 

Last year for Christmas, things were better, things were looking up. It still wasn't the best, but my living situation was way better. Had an apartment with my boyfriend, always had food, always had clean clothes, a shower, a tv, hell, even a playstation I never pawned (and still have might I add.) I had put up a Christmas tree while jamming out to holiday music. I might've even baked some sugar cookies! But still, the family was distant. I woke up that Christmas morning, starring at the fancy tree I decorated, with no gifts underneath and no family around. 

Fast forward to this Christmas, things are getting better. its the 22nd and I still haven't bothered to put up the tree yet, maybe Ill do that today, but I might be lucky enough to spend the holidays with my family this year. My mom reached out and invited me over for Christmas. What a relief. What a gift on its on. Getting to spend Christmas day with my mom, step-dad, little brothers and grandparents. Getting to see the tree in the house. Getting to watch everyone open up their presents. Getting to see my little brothers get all excited over their new toys. Getting to eat a home cooked meal with everyone. Im grateful this year, and excited. It might be the first Christmas in a very, very long time that I'll actually enjoy. Family is what its all about.  This year, Christmas will be better

Either way, it truly is, a gift on its own, to be able to spend the holidays with family. Never forget that. Just a reminder to be grateful. Things could always be worse. This year, Im grateful my mom invited me over on Christmas day. ",1513960262.0

But, I don't have any real experience with opana. I've done hydro, oxy, even small slivers of fent patches, but I know that popping these isn't the best route, and I've never IVed nor intend to. So I'm left with snorting it. Couple questions?

Best way to remove er coating?

I've heard these are hard to crush say in comparison to Roxy 15s or mdones, any tips on best way to crush this monster?

I plan on sniffing a 4th of it starting out. My usual dose is 15 to 20 mg of oxy either popped or sniffed depending what it is.
