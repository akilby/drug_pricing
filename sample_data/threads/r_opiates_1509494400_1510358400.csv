7a3kfs,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7a3kfs/methods_of_preventing_testosterone_shutdown/,5,https://redd.it/7a3kfs,podface,Methods of preventing testosterone shutdown,"We know that opiates are benign in terms of direct harmfulness to the body and organs and most of the dangers associated with addicition come from the lifestyle itself, the OD potential and the cutting agents. But those who have a steady source of clean pharma-grade stuff could potentially live as long as any normal person. 
However there is a huge understated danger of opiates: all of them drain and eventually shut down the testosterone production in male users. This in itself not a life-threatening issue but testosterone is the fuel of energy, productivity and manliness. Without it, there is no drive and motivation to live, create and set new goals in life.
For functional addcts who are able to maintain a productive lifestyle the biggest challenge in the long run is how to minimalize this testosterone drainage. 

-	Is there a safe daliy limit (let‚Äôs say under 50mg morphine/day) that can be consumed in the long run without testosterone reduction?
-	Or if you are addicted to say 200mg of oxy/day, is it better to consume that dose in one setting (200mg after work) or two settings (100mg in the morning, 100mg in the afternoon)? 
Or is it better to consume 400mg in one setting but only every other day (one day suffering and one day heaven)? 

Which method would reduce the development of testosterone reduction more effectively? Does it make a difference at all? 

Is anyone out there who have experimented with these methods before or found a successful way in terms of damage control? 
I think the long-term hormonal problems are the biggest obstacle in maintaining a functional addiction and we should experiment and establish guidelines for the prevention of long-term testosterone shutdown.

Is it the Norco or tge Adderall thats Fucking me up.","Before i start. Let me just say i am proud of that title. 

So. Ive been ""hooked"" on Norco for about a year and a half now. I say ""hooked"" because it was never a HAD TO HAVE THEM type of deal. I do concrete for a living and am heavily involved with lifting weights. Wakeboarding, skateboarding etc. Im Very active, im also very clumsy. I get hurt a lot. Unlike most of the guys i work with i dont like drinking. If im partying all night. Ill get piss drunk. But i cannot stand drinking after work, or as a way to help me go to sleep. Thats where norco came in, lets pretend for a second that i had a endless supply. 
I say endless because the small amounts that i take is laughable to real users. 15-30mg TOPS. i would take them as a way to settle down from work. And go to bed comfortably. My little stress relievers. Did that 3 or 4 days a week for a year. Never had ANY  W/D  Symptoms.

-Heres where things change.- 

About six months ago i got promoted to foreman, and my days became far less physical. Way more mentally straining. I hit up my doctor and got back on adderal which i used to take in college. It helped for awhile. 
3 months ago my best friend commited suicide. (Worst thing i have ever gone through. I ised to joke about suicide. And how its weak minded. Will never make another joke again. Dont take that shit lightly my friend Robbie was solid as a rock, all it takes is one bad moment.) ANYWAYS. . . I being somebody who likes to be in control of shit, was absolutely NOT in control . . . Of shit. 

I couldn't focus on work so i doubled the adderall. Then i couldn't sleep so i doubled *cough*tripled*cough* the Norco. My friend was my workout partner so i have yet to touch a weight. 

Low and behold After a month of INTENSE self medicating and avoiding the process of mourning. I decided to stop taking Norco and Aderall (and blow, and Jameson, and nicotine) cold turkey until i got my shot together. 
I KNOW, I KNOW, wtf was i thinking. . . Well i wasnt. 

Well if it makes you happy to know. which i know it would for me if i was reading you post this instead of me. I got a crash course in chemical dependencies and detoxing. Best part is, i was so busy at work i didnt even know what the fuck was happening to me, i remember thinking, while laying in bed flopping around like a fish at 3am. Pissing out of my ass and sweating so much i reinvented the term ""water bed"" Thinking i had a really bad flu. ""If i die from this Flu, nobody is going to get a fucking thing done tomorrow, i should email (my lead guy) the rebar design. In case anything happens.

So. I eventually realized what was happening. Jumped back on norco and adderall but went to half of what i was taking. two 15MG of adderall XR a day, and Four Norco 10/325 at night. 
Im currently down to one 15mg Adderall xr. And 1.5 Norco 10/325 a day. I feel completely fine but if i dont take the norco i get RLS like a motherfucker. 

Now that youve listened to me rant and moan, Here is my question.

I really really dont want to go through opiate Withdrawals until the job im on is finished and im back home. Instead of in this shot hole motel in west Texas (i travel for work) im trying to get ahold of more norco, but its been difficult. I have enough for a few more days. 

1.How bad will the detox be if i have been doing fine on 15mg a daily. And can i just stay there for awhile, safely? 

2. Is the Adderall making the symptoms worse, because i swear when the XR pills wear off i get moody as hell, and im wondering of the amphetamines are intensifying the Restless Leg Syndrome because ive never had withdrawal symptoms before when taking almost twice this much.

3.could the sudden lack of physical activity be playing a part in the intensity of all this as well. (Mood swings, Restless Legs, sudden and severe anxiety, always tired)

Idk what to do im at a sustainable point right now. I want to know if dropping the adderall will HELP or HINDER me, and how bad the detox will be. Thanks guys

3. if you are not using headphones to prevent echoing, you have to turn off your mic when you're not speaking, because your mic will pick up what comes through on your pc speakers. shoot that through 4 other people whose is doing the same thing with various rates of delay, and you have digital shoegaze except it sounds terrible. ask for details if you have a question.

My mom has been addicted to heroin since I was about 1. She has been in and out of jail my entire life so we had a strained relationship at times. She was an amazing woman. She had the biggest heart, so caring and strong. She never had a bad word to say about anyone. I‚Äôve been a heroin addict for about 4 years now and she knew about it and tried to help me as much as she could. She got arrested in June this year and was locked up until October 18th. On Sunday she was asking me to come over and watch the football game with her but I didn‚Äôt feel like driving to her house cause it‚Äôs pretty far. Her boyfriend she was living with talked to her at 4pm and when he got home at 11:30pm he found her in the bathroom. It was clear she had been dead awhile. 

My heart is so broken. Typing the words, ‚Äúmy mother is dead‚Äù is so hard. So many people keep saying their sorry, I know there isn‚Äôt much you can say to someone who just lost their 43 year old mother... I just miss her a lot. 

I‚Äôm her next of kin so I had to do all the paperwork today... I got to see her body. They warned me that her face would be dark... I didn‚Äôt know what they meant. Because she was dead face first on the ground for so long blood pooled in her forehead and around her eyes.... she was so much more beautiful than that. 

Everyone that met her loved her. She would give her shirt off her back for a stranger. She never did anything but love those around her. She deserved more. 

Thank you all for your love. I‚Äôm needing it right now. ",1509503708.0

Quick background.. been on and off B for a couple years and I smoke it only. Whenever I end up quitting for a couple months, I am basically unable to sleep for 1 night, kicking, and after that next day I can sleep and feel normal. Tomorrow I plan on staying clean because I have a flight to catch in the morning the day after for a wedding. 

Now, my main concern is what kind of precautions should I take so I don't stay in the bathroom the whole time for pain?

I have 1 8mg suboxyne strip and that is it. Will the suboxyne help the pooping problem? If so, will it just delay that part of the withdrawal til the next day? I read that suboxyne can cause constipatuon but this is only 1 strip after all and should I break the strip into 2 or 4 pieces and how should I dose them?

Longest I've been sober in 2 whole damn years. Went from daily IV use of a gram to a ball a day, to quitting cold turkey and moving all the way across the country to a small town in Southern IL from NC.

Well anyway, I had originally said how I was supposed to get a 4000 dollar check on the 15th or so of November. Well last night I had a weird ass dream that someone transferred me 90 bucks to my account and then I woke up thinking nothing of it. Went to check my account and guess who has two thumbs and got that 4k check deposited today? This guy...

So here is my predicament...

Do I take the 19 hour greyhound back home to NC for the day tomorrow and cop an ounce and then head back to IL and just survive of that and chip by only sniffing and not returning to IV hopefully (seriously believe I can only use once a day only during the weekends) or do I sit my ass here and stay sober..

I'm not on MM or Subs/Sobos, I literally just quit cold turkey and surprisingly enough, it was the easiest wd I've ever gone thru, but I have been having a hankering for some fire ass China and my dope boy called me yesterday and said the shit he has now is literally the BEST shit he has ever had... And he NEVER says that. He literally was singing praises about this shit.

What to do opiate family.. What to fucking do...

This money is burning a hole in my pocket and I can either spend a bunch on drugs and come back to IL where I can't get shit in my town, or I can save and spend it on senseless shit like getting the rest of my neck tattooed, buying junk food, getting back into playing instruments (played for 15 years and play 5 different instruments)

Not to mention on the actual 15th, I have another 1k check coming my way...

Onto my rant! 

I'm pretty much the only person in the circle of people I know who can and does drive. I call these people my using friends. They all dabble in various things, most of them are in WAY too deep, but none of them have a license or car. I don't mind helping people out every now and then. I get AT LEAST 5 to 6 texts and/or calls a day from friends asking for rides here, there, to the dope man, etc.

The benefit is when I take a couple people to their ""guy"" and get hooked up with a dub for driving. I'm currently able to spend about $5 a day and come out with at least $25-$50 in free dope a day. The thing that pisses me off is it seems like lately everyone expects me to drop what the fuck I'm doing and come to them because they're sick, or they need a ride right now. 

Someone today set me off. Random number hit me up saying ""So and so gave me your number, I need a ride to ____""

I said Cool, do you have the number for a taxi? She texts back ""Oh, he said you could come get me, I appreciate it, when will you be here?"" I responded ""First off, my car doesn't run on appreciation. Secondly, I don't know you, but I DO KNOW that it doesn't say Uber or Taxi anywhere on the side of my car.""

Then 'So and so' texts me and seems upset asking why I won't give his homegirl a ride. I don't even fuckin like this guy, he ripped me off once and I quit talking to him until recently when he gave me back what he owed me. Then turns around immediately and asks me to take him to Home Depot so he can run inside, snatch tools and run out, then go pawn them for drug money. No, I'm not your fuckin getaway driver, I'm not taking you to do anything that's going to involve theft. 

These people assume Just because I sometimes partake in certain substances from time to time doesn't mean I'm desperate for them and will stop everything to take you to cop in exchange for it. I've got money, I'm capable of maintaining on $10 of dope a day,and I afford my habit.

Is there anything I can do to feel euphoria from dhc/tram, I know there's the possibility I'm deficient in the enzyme but in that case I shouldn't get any effects from it. Is 500mg of DHC unsafe to take? I also shouldn't have any notable tolerance.

That's when you turn the age of the day of your birthday. For those that don't know this. For me that meant I was 29 on October 29th. 

I could not have been more miserable and angry with myself for being miserable about it.

My new man had booked us a cabin the woods as a birthday gift to me. We have only been together a month. ANyway, in an effort to NOT be dope sick on my birthday or in the cabin, I went through withdrawals a week and a half ago. 

I had it counted perfectly.gave mom enough pills to last me for my trip and told her no to give them to me till X day. I stuck to it and was really proud of myself for sticking to it. 

So we get to the cabin and I'm counting out what I have when my brain decides that October 29th doesn't to exist. So I count out for October 27th, 28th, & 30th. I was supposed to be out in the early morning on the 30th since that was the day we were headed home into town. 

So, I wake p on the 29th (my birthday) go to take my morning dose and realize my horrible, horrible, horrible mistake. 

#Happy fucking birthday to me.

To top things off I also had a cold somehow and came to the ""sad"" realization that I'm almost 30 in a body that could easily be at least twice my age. I felt so bad for my man too, because I was really sour. He took it in strides like a champ though and did a few things to help me feel better, bath, sex, walks, food, comfort meds from CVS, that sorta thing. 

We even debated going to the hospital but I insisted on not doing that because I know how useless they are. Even though I was having a bit of projectile vomiting (so I'm not all convinced it was purely withdrawals) I did eat quite a bit of junk food out there so that my have been contributing.

I made the best of it all though. At least as best as I could and then when we got home on the 30th my hematologist was gracious enough to squeeze me into an appointment so I could get a set of IV pain meds, IV nausea meds, IV stomach meds, and IV fluids. I should be square for the next 12-24hrs now.

So then I got to thinking about the only group I actually fit into perfectly, and that's the hard drug group - i.e. all the misfits who couldn't find a place to belong. People fall through the set up period of life (up through highschool and early post high school) and at one point fall into something. Sports, theater, video, singing, band, whatever. My dad made me realize there's a common theme with all the addicts I know around my age, and it's that we never found one to belong to. May have tried several different scenes but none clicked. All these people who didn't find one end up all at the bottom, looking around at each other wondering why everyone is down there with them and what's going to happen. 

Remember in Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer, there was the island of misfit toys, where all of the broken toys Santa couldn't give out on Christmas all lived together? That's us. We're the misfit toys. With nowhere else to belong the misfits only have one place to be, the bottom, but they're all there together, which in turn means they do belong to something. 

When I have the time, I go crazy on here and /r/Drugs having a great time articulating my thoughts and getting them out there. I feel comfortable doing that and it helps me, and now since my dad made that point it has me very confused. Not only do I express myself on here, but for the most part the only friends that have kept me around and still hang out with me are other addicts. Should I be concerned that I'm immersing myself so deeply into the scene that I finally clicked into, the scene that holds so much potential to be toxic and only bring my weaknesses to light? Is that healthy? As of right now I'm clean and being able to throw my thoughts out there and help street friends out definitely helps me, but at the same time it's being immersed in that whole scene that destroyed me in the first place. So I'm really confused.",1509474404.0

ive had so many close calls with this shit. the day i learned what pwd was, i had an interview for a promotion. i got the job, but the pwd started as i was being interviewed. ended up not showing up for work for two days because i was so sick until i figured out what was going on. my solution was to just stay on heroin.

that was about six months ago. my habit along with my boyfriend's became unsustainable quickly. he went to jail two weeks ago so i promised him id suck it up and be on subs by the time he got out. we tried a few times in the previous months but we could never hold out long enough to avoid the pwd; one of us always caved.

well i did it and it sucked but i welcome the feeling of relief knowing i don't have to come up with $100/day give or take, you know. didn't really stop in time to avoid some utilities getting shut off and a possible red tag on my car but im hoping it'll all shake out at some point. it always does if i keep my nose clean. and this time i get to smoke weed and not be on probation, so that's a plus.

i have a great job with plenty of oppurtunity to move up and make a decent living for a drug addict college drop out. i like it there and i don't want to fuck it up as ive done repeatedly in my past.

no point to this except to talk about it. i want to be on the other side where stuff is fixed, but it'll be a minute. got my boy at the sub clinic now so we can stay well, put gas in my car and eat until i get paid. and we will trudge along as always.",1509473892.0

RIGHT!)","My life.. MY GODDAMN LIFE IS A FUCKING MESS. I've been trying to fix it for a whole year and just can't do it.

I did something at the request of my parents for further help from them, to pay them back and prove I'm serious about turning things around.. I put an amazing CV together and went after a crazy well paid IT job.. and got it. I've tried this year to quit, been unsuccessful, generally miserable, but now I have incentive and more desire to do so..

Now, it's been three weekends going cold turkey so I can live a life with a great job and normal routine.. but nope  it's just not long enough and round and round I go :(


I'm gonna get fired for taking so many sick days on when I can't score the night before. I end up sweating and being sick at work. They think I'm the sickest person alive. Ive taken too many days sick now in attemots to colf turkey. I took a friday and the weekend off and it still wasn't enough. I still lapsed as I couldn't handle the stage 3 (stage 1: sweating, sickness, stage 2 no energy, sweat, depression. Stage 3: Horrible totally weird feeling, total detachment from reality. Can't think straight, like looking out through my eyes on a Dreamworld devoid of any emotion or connection. Like tripping on acid but all the horrible aspects of it. Makes dealing with people and crowds impossible.

I've looked into so many over the counter medicines, everything I can possibly get my hands on and I'm almost suicidal wanting this to end. I've had enough of this vicious circle of life. 

Round and round. Unwanted. Unhappy. No highs, just lows and lack of illness. It's been like this for years now and this is the rock bottom of happiness and wanting escape. Maybe it would be tolerable if the gear was good.. but it isn't!!


I fucking hate drug services. To get an appointment for maintenance or tapering with bupe takes 3 weeks. What the fuck am I supposed to do in the meantime?? They also only do appointments 9-5 weekdays. Assuming every addict has no job and is a damn wasteman. What are professionals with jobs supposed to do!?

I tried a loperamide detox. Got one day in , but it stops working after that for me. I just can't get enough clean days to stop sweating. I can go without sleep, with depression, it's the sickness , lack of energy and sweating that gives me away. 

I don't know what to do. :(

It was a two Saturdays ago, I've been on Suboxone for almost 3 months now but I've been dabbling with sniffing dope on days I decide to skip my sub dose. On this particular day I did take my sub dose in the morning but I wanted to get high so I hit up my mans who was selling chronic & Hulks (Green Xanax Bars). I buy a couple and a blunt and proceed to head home, I take one Xanax right away and by the time I'm home I begin to feel the benzo kicking in but not as profoundly as usual so I make the biggest mistake of that weekend and take the other Xanax bar. I had plans with my girlfriend that night (she thinks I'm 100% clean of all drugs) but she was working until 9 PM so I had some time to kill so I decide to go to this other chicks (we'll call her A)  house simply because she lives 2 minutes away from me and it was something to do. Now I'm at A's house smoking blunts and she offers me a beer? Sure! why not, one Heineken quickly turns into 2 and before I know it I'm two hulks and 3 beers in! Now at this point I'm fucked up but I don't think I am so I go back home and get ready for dinner with my girlfriend, we'll call her ""M"". My time with her is a complete blur, apparently she could tell I was fucked up and smelled of beer so luckily I was able to convince her that I was just a bit tipsy, regardless an argument ensues at Olive Garden and I end up going home pissed off. My problem with benzos has always been that once I'm on them I wanna keep getting higher on anything and everything I can get my hands on so I start hitting up Dboys/Dgirls and end up at a trap house in the hood in my beautiful Midwestern town. I do a point and whilst there I run into an old dboy/user who I used to run with and he offers me a half gram to go drive around in my car ('13 BMW 5 Series) and make some plays, I oblige. We end up driving around allllllll morning into the next afternoon, smoking crack, sniffing dope and doing all type of drug related shit. I finally get back home Sunday at approx. 6 PM. I am 23 and live with my parents/little sister not of necessity(I have a great career) but because we're immigrants from Europe and neither of them speak English so I help take care of them. Nonetheless, they're upset with me because I'm clearly intoxicated so I hit up my best friend who also sniffs dope because I introduced him too it and I meet up with him to get some KFC and do some dope. Our go-to Dboy had some absolute fire apparently and we split a .2 between the two of us and we were literally sitting there nodding off trying to have a conversation. I convince him to trade me a .2 for some addy that I somehow ended up in my possession from the night before (NO CLUE HOW I GOT IT) We make the transaction and he drives off, I check out the .2 and it looks short so I say fuck it and dump it out and sniff that too.... I make the 5 minute drive home and the last thing I remember is pulling up to my house and almost pulling into my neighbors driveway instead of my own. 

MY EYES OPEN and I'm shivering uncontrollably in the back of an ambulance, I'm banged up and bleeding. Someone is asking me what I took so I lie and say I took some Percs, anyone who has ever been Narcan'd (I have twice) will tell you that while its great in the sense that it is literally saving your life, it still is the most horrible feeling in the world. Apparently, I pulled up into my driveway and my father opened the garage and came up to my car and I was slumped over unresponsive. Somehow, he managed to drag me out of my car into the house, tearing up my knees and feet in the process. I have two older brothers so my parents called them (they both live 2 minutes away) so they arrived shortly, my breathing was very feint and I had a pulse so they didn't know whether or not to call 911 but when I completely stopped breathing and was turning blue the call was made. My poor little sister witnessed the entire thing, screaming crying thinking that her brother was dead.... This was such a huge set back for me, I had been doing so good, using very sporadically, taking my subs, doing great at work (My brothers & I own a successful company) earning my family's trust and then this shit happened man. I believe 100% that if I didn't take that Xanax Saturday afternoon that none of this would've happened but I'm just fortunate to be alive man... I am sorry this was so long but I had to get it off my chest. This all occurred on 10/22 & I can honestly say I have not used dope since, I've been smoking weed and have popped NO MORE than ONE xanax, most times taking a half a bar...

I waited downtown sipping beers until ran out of beer around 3am and he still hadn't called back. I was frustrated because I had to pay for an uber because I missed the bus waiting on drugs that never came. 

Arrive at the apartment fully prepared to black the fuck out off shitty rum and cokes and wouldn't you know it I'm halfway through my first drink and I get the text ""yooo sorry man club was lit slide thru."" 

And before you even ask you can bet your ass I paid for two more Ubers to go all the way back downtown and pay $30 each for 3 pills that used to get for $19 before I moved out here last month. Filled up a nice big drink in my thermos for the trip. 

When I got there, dude was so blacked out and I guess he was in a good mood so he threw me 3 dilly 4s for free for my troubles. Chewed the oxys on the spot, and popped a bar the second I got back home. It's around 6am now and I'm on my fifth rum and Coke and I'm feeling fucking amazing. There's nothing more pleasing to me than the booze hitting you little by little and as you slowly sip it, taking the edge off and potentiating your pill buzz.

Not sure how long I'll keep drinking but at this rate I'll probably be passed out and not make it to work tonight. Fuck it though, I was planning on just packing my shit and moving out to Cali and bailing anyway, that day might come sooner than planned. 

Here's to another day r/opiates friends. I hope your day is filled with all the drugs you can dream of, or sobriety or whatever makes you find peace. One thing I know is im gonna already need to grab some more oxys by tonight, but for now I'll enjoy.

TL;DR - Waited hours and paid for three expensive ubers to get 3 blues. Didn't get them til around 5am. Took a bar when I got home, and I'm working my way through some shitty rum and cokes. Happy nods people.

Which she was going to court for currently. Well recently she blew up because she started putting fent in her bags after having really bad shit for a long time and losing everyone. She never told anyone except for people who were able to tell it was fent and not just dope or who was close to her. So basically for the last month she's been pumping fent without telling anyone, so people didn't know why they were getting sick so so so early and why everyone was overdosing so often. Like a lot of people. So the other day she gets into her second police chase in a 'crack rental' brand new 5 series BMW without Regis insurance and prob stolen. She's unable to get away and ends up hitting an officer with the car. So she just copped assault on an officer plus felonie evade plus another intent and a shit load more felonies and misdemeanors along with it. So there's a whole town/area/county now addicted to fentynal without even knowing it, making there tolerances so god damn high that when they pick up dope from other connects it's 'garbage' to them and they don't get why. Has this ever happened to any of you? This girl is obviously not getting a bail and is going to have to serve her bid for at least a year or two MINIMUM.

Want to ramble about confusing shit real quick.,"You can see the massive variation of how my busy my days are by my comment binging (pretty sure that's the term I want) followed by abrupt inactivity. 

Staying clean feels easier this time, which is terrifying because I don't want my guard to be down. However it gives me room to change behavioral patterns. 

But ya know, I actually have to change them. Last night I got robbed, was in a car chase pursuing the fuckers, then got chased by cops because I guess they were watching the dudes house after he escaped from custody or some shit and obviously associated me with him. I couldn't tell you how, but I turned enough corners in that ghetto neighborhood to get away without having my licence plate identified. I hope... right after that I went to hit my homegirl with a shot of meth because she refuses to learn to shoot up herself. Earlier in the night before all that I beat this kid up for stealing my homeless friends necessities. 

God damn it. I fell for the illusion that once you're clean, you're free, just keeping doing whatever is working everyday. Well yeah, that's great for heroin, but I need to stop running around in the streets doing ridiculous shit. I was clean during the shotgun story in that apartment if anyone read that one. I know I'm not doing right by myself because when I picture someone who is clean and content with being clean, they have completely separated themselves from the shit I do every day. Yeah, I'm not shooting heroin but I feel like making that the only perameter to say you're ""clean"" is asking to make this as  dragging and difficult as possible. If I keep running the streets, I'll use full time again, or if I don't I may as well be because that would only tightly bottleneck how much progress I can actually make. This shit is exhausting and I wonder how many people who have and continue extended periods of clean time are actually where I would imagine fitting the definition of clean. I say I'm clean because I still haven't shot up, but I'm still doing drug deals, beating people up over bullshit, getting chased by cops and getting guns stuck in my face. This can't be what clean is. If it is then I might just freak the fuck out and stop trying to wrap my head around the entire concept. Like I'm young but I'm blatantly rapidly ageing myself because this scene is exhausting to live in. 

I think that I think too much.

twice a day i laboriously hobble up to the rooftop playground they have for kids (it's always empty) to smoke and look out on the city. I'm actually frightened this time.

-Something is wrong with me‚Ä¶  I just want to feel free.

-NO! You told yourself you would not do it again. 

-But is it that bad? What do we have to lose. 

-Yes, you know it is. Please don't do this to yourself. I beg you!

-I have nothing to lose. I'm living husk, a zombie that can't feel the sweet taste of happiness anymore.

-DON'T CALL THE MOTHER.

-I'm sorry...


And so I did, I called the Mother. She was there, in front of me. A wave of euphoria went through my body just imagining me in her arms. So soft‚Ä¶ So comfy‚Ä¶ I know she doesn't really love me. She is just a damn mercenary and don't give a fuck about me. But her false unconditional love is the only thing I need right now. 


-You will regret this!

-Just one last time‚Ä¶ Just one...


Suddenly I felt like small child in warm arms of the Mother. Everything is perfect, each second is just pure bliss. The world is not just a chaotic and indifferent mess anymore. All is where it's supposed to be. Even the voice of reason is now mute, just appreciating this small moment with me. 


Even then, something feel out of place... This isn't the Mother I knew. When I look at her hands and finally notice something I didn't saw before: the Reapers knife. The bloody serial killer, the Machiavellian monster, the destroyer of worlds. Then by just by a cut, I'm done. With feelings of pure love and joy, I'm just unable to react about my morbid fate while the Mother gently fondle my hair until my last dying breath...

It's the destiny of all man to go from ashes to ashes, but this fate came earlier for me. Ironically, I also followed my own promise. This was the last time with H indeed.

Oxycodone/Heroin is more of a rushy high ""I FEEL GREAT"", Methadone is more of a ""Everything is gonna be ok, fear no evil"" type of high. It's more subtle.

Last Wednesday I ODd but thankfully my middle man has Narcan on him. The middleman is relevant because since I came into this money I wanted to get a zip ($1800). However, middleman is somewhat of a friend going through hard times and whenever I cop I typically give him 20-50% of what I get. I cant afford to lose like 5-10 gs off the top of a zip so I said fuck it had contacted the plug because I have his number. Plug seems agitated that I called him we've met a few times but it was brief. So plug tells me to come thru and I do. He works at an auto body shop so when I got there he told me to just pull into the bay. I pull in and low and behold the middle man and plug are there and they both hop into my car. Plug rips me a new one off the jump and tells me that while he respects the amount of money I bring he can't take any risks even though he knows my past knows I ain't no snitch or something. 

So moving forward dude tells me the price of the zip went up $200 for my mistake. I tell him no thanks (out of the principal in my head because I had no bad intentions I'm just a good customer and will find a new plug if need be I've never had that problem). So I had to bring middle man home and he is fuckin livid. I only bought 3 bags ($150-1.5 gs). 

So anyways my addiction is getting worse and worse. I went to rehab (FMA in Maryland...Amazing fuckin rehab top of the line costs 33K). I haven't stole anything but my parents definitely know. I've called out of work 3 days in a row now and am going back tomorrow. Mentally I'm just numb. I have open charges and I've been violated on probation for 9 months. I have court in march. I just hate my life right now. I have a great girlfriend who lives an hour and a half Away. If it wasn't for her I'd be dead. My mom told me on the phone today to just OD so I'm not in their way. My dad gave me money that he owes me and my mom threatened to divorce him for giving me my money. 

I just see where my life is going and I don't know what to do guys. All I have is my gf and I should still have a job. I don't want to die or fuck everything up but sometime it seems like shits too far gone ",1509563976.0

I don't use back accounts and rarely GreenDot card because of the fees.

I just moved into this residency and the guy is okay, but one of the first things he said to me *after* I had paid was that he was looking for a friend and someone to do something even (he mentioned missing sucking dick).  Red flags went off right away, but then again I just put down first and last and it was affordable and in the right area.  I was't rude, but I brushed him off.

This morning, after drinking a bit the night before, I notice two odd things.  My door was unlocked, which it shouldn't have been as I always lock my door, and my wallet is not where it usually is, nor is my cellphone on the charger as it usually is.  

I checked my pockets and I'm missing the entire remainder of my paycheck, which I needed in order to pay rent and survive.  I literally cannot even take the bus.

I have torn the whole room apart, looking for anywhere that I may have stashed it, but it's not there.  Only my wallet, on the nightstand, completely fucked with.  I don't know what to do guys, It took me a long time to get out of being homeless and frankly, under no circumstances am I going back.  I'm freaking out and don't know what to do I'm not sucking dick I need real answers I'm falling apart.

Oh, I should mention that since I moved in this guy has been going after me with sexual advances, which I have declined.  I am a male, but just this morning he sent me a text saying ""looks like you could use some Vitamin 'D'"".  I'm disgusted and scared and have no one to help I'm honestly thinking of just drinking enough and making one last hurrah of a shot.

I had spent all summer away from my hometown on the amazing West Coast. I was working, exercising, eating properly, and enjoying sunshine. I was around my family, a couple friends, and fellow coworkers I had met at my summer internship. 

Then, around Aug 16th I had to go back to the Midwest. I could feel myself slipping into a depressed state the moment I reached the airport to head back to my hometown. Every passing moment on the plane was filled with bi-polar thoughts, switching between negative and positive. 

Then... I landed...

The moment I got off that fucking plane, it was like I had entered a new arena, a new battlefield, a new life. I immediately wanted to go back to the West Coast but I couldn't due to school. I was forced to be here, and I didn't know what to do, or how to cope. 

So what did I do? 

I pissed away 4 months of sobriety and called up the pill heads I hadn't talked to in several months. From there everything spun out of control. From August 20th until Oct 1st, I pissed away all of my money. Even though I am in college, I had developed a bitcoin portfolio that at the time was $3400 (As of Nov. 1st, it would be worth a lot more), along with $2000 in cash.

Where I was born in the midwest is still flooded with pills, even though there have been major cutbacks by the government and big pharma. So the street dealers, and monthly script receivers took all my money.

Once I was out of hard cash....

I started selling my bitcoins for USD, and then transferring every last penny into my bank account. From there I went on 41 day bender where I was high as fuck on painkillers during the morning and day, drinking booze every evening, and popping xanax multiple times a week to sleep. 

Then on October 1st, I woke up and realized how I had no money for gas or food or anything. So I started to go through horrible withdrawal. I would be sitting in lecture for statistics class and I felt like I was going to pass out and die in front of everyone. After about a week or two of this hell I knew I had to make a change.

So I called a very good friend and lied to him about why I was broke and why I need to borrow $500 until January. Luckily we are on great terms and he agreed to give me the money with no questions. 

So what do I do?

Go buy more pills instead of getting clean and trying to get my shit together. RELAPSE CITY BABY! IT FEELS SO FUCKING HORRIBLY GREAT!

Then October 28th hit and I ran completely broke again. I knew I couldn't ask for anymore hand outs, so now I am trying to figure out where to go from here. 

Currently I am on day 4-5 of being clean and it is horrible. I have no energy, no appetite, my social anxiety is so bad I have been missing classes because I don't want my classmates or friends to see me like this. In fact, my friend group at my university has become suspicious of my whereabouts because I have been avoiding the hell out of everyone, even my best friend Jack. 

My mental state is horrible. Every time I look at the price of bitcoin GO UP AND UP AND UP AND UP, I literally want to take a gun to my head and kill myself. It's fucking terrible. Every time my family calls me, I have to muster up all my energy and act super happy over the phone and lie about how well I am doing. 

I just want to blow my brains out. What the fuck is wrong with me.

The H i have is #3 the brown stuff we get i EU. Yesterday i snorted about 80mg in 3-4 hours and didn't feel anything but dizzy, racing heart beat and so on. I was in bad oxy WD and the H didn't do anything at all combating those awfull WD - i was anxious and couldn't find myself comfortable anywhere. I suspect that the H is cut with a fair amount of caffiene which worsened my condition yesterday. So the experience was bad and boring.

Today i have been smoking a little bit like 10mg's or something and feel a little bit, but not too much. I have been taking 50mg's of methadone this morning but it's nothing against my oxy addiction (+700 - 800mg's a day) so my opiate tolerance is huge. But i'm going to take it slow on the H no matter what.

When do i know that the H on the foil is ""finished"" and there nothing more to smoke? Is it when ALL liqiud is gone?
And the shinning side of the foil should be up (towards me) right? I have never ever smoked on foil before, but i have seen some youtube videos where people smoke on foil and i have been inhaling to smoke so i know i'm doing something right lol

But I'm saying is that essentially we're the generation that created opiod epidemic and fentanyl problem so in say 50+ years from now a different generation will be affected by this, either by putting an end to it or just diving straight into it and dropping like flies. It's no secret that the east coast and surrounding areas are absolutely fucked as little by little every last stamp bag or bag of ""raw"" is cut with fent. And then everywhere else in the country gets tar but now that's getting fent-cut too. And I feel like that will only get worse as every dealer starts to cash in on the easy profits and users just get worse in terms of tolerance/withdrawal. And now every all the pills are fake - to the point that fucking green roxys and percocet presses are fentanyl. You can't trust a pill if you can't personally confirm the validity of the source's script.

So what do you guys think will happen? In my opinion, the world drug markets really only boil down to a few key players. Obviously there's tons of dealers but I feel the key players have the biggest impact on all the drugs. Someone high up, for whatever reason, is making the decisions to cut this stuff with fent. Now the opioids I can ALMOST understand (but still don't), but Fucking xanax and cocaine laced with fentanyl? Why? There's obviously some motive to the key players making these choices to keep doing them, after all to be in the positions they're in they aren't stupid and they know exactly what they're doing and that this can eventually one day be traced back to them as basically manslaughter, so I don't think it's just ""hey let's kill tons of people and increase my risk of life in prison by killing all these junkies, for fun"". I just don't see the motive to it.

I think that for whatever reason these drugs are cut with fent it's only gonna get worse and spread into everything, and I mean everything. We've already seen the articles, they're most likely rumors, about carfentanil being in marijuana and in blotters sold off as most likely LSD. But I wouldn't put it past people nowadays and at this rate this epidemic is going to just completely spread to homes that would've never been affected by it because their kid smoked a joint or did a line of coke at a party and died from a potent synthetic opiod. I just don't really see this situation getting any better. The war on drugs will only continue to make the situation worse as we continue to prosecute drug addicts and bar them from future employment/success and ultimately lead to their death from drugs. And while I obviously think it's great that narcan is becoming readily available and I support it 100%, I mean truthfully I don't know how much it really ""helps"". Yeah I get it if it saves your child's life it's worth it but I'm saying in the grand scheme of this epidemic. I haven't been on heroin lately but when I saw the article about walgreens carrying narcans I actually thought ""cool, I can start doing H again because I can just get someone to narcan me"". Yeah, assholes like me ruin opiods for everyone. And while narcan will save plenty of lives, it also can enable. Again, I support it fully, but I'm open to both sides.

Honestly if there's gonna end up being carfentanil in Fucking pot I wouldn't be surprised if people will start putting in the god damn water at this point for whatever reason. We're all gonna have to take ""test sips"" just to get a fucking drink. And as the next generation has to deal with the remnants of our epidemic, they won't get the luxury of starting on oxy 10s and hydros like we did, those days are over. They'll just be diving straight into fentanyl as by then everything will move towards maximum profits and fentanyl will most likely take over the entire drug trade. And that's my opinion about the fentanyl epidemic that you guys most likely don't care about. ",1509711836.0

I was awake for about 5 days, was insanely dopesick & desperate for a fix, but was also using some up (G, Tina, ect...) for energy, slight help with withdrawal & because I got it for free (i dont usually like this as downers are my DOC, but it was free & slightly helped with my sickness).. Well finally around 11PM my friend who i was staying at their house for a couple days ended up coming home with some boi. She gave me a nornal size shot (normal as in slightly smaller than i usually do) & next thing i remember is being in the shower approximately 1-2 hours later with some dude drenching me in cold water, then hot, then cold, then hot & so forth. (apparently I did the shot in the locked bathroom & they realized  i never returned, so they broke into the bathroom & there i was overdosing. (they wouldn't give me any other details about the situation which really pissed me off because i want to know considering i was blacked out.)
After that, the bathroom ended up drenched cuz we shattered the toilet apparently.. Next I blacked out again & don't remember anything til the next day waking up 6PM confused as fuckk..

I've been using H & fentanyl for 6-7 years & have never od'd before, & I also always make sure i do small shots first until i know the quality of h. Which I guess is why I was so confused. So i guess my question is (prolly an obvious answer but just wanted to hear a couple other opinions) was it because i was awake for so long (4-5 days about), did they put something in it to mske me fall asleep/not waste all their bag sharing with me, Or did i simply just docroo much? A other opinions would be greatly appreciated also.

She has been on Suboxone ever since I have known her. Never nods off or gets too mellow, but I can tell that she enjoys it in some fashion.

(Can anybody help me understand how a drug that is meant to have no euphoric abilities (or so I thought), why a person might hoard them and take more than their regularly prescribed dosage? Does it just make you feel more normal or something?)

She has changed recently. I can't explain how.. she just looks ""worse""... like more of a drug addict than the person I've known for so long now basically.

But I can't figure out how or why?

I thought that Suboxone prevents you from using other opiates? And I know that her only other drugs of choice are alcohol and cigarettes.

And is it normal for somebody to be on Suboxone for 5+ years? Isn't it meant to eventually wean you off of it completely?

Isn't staying on it for such a long time going to make it all the more difficult to get off of it?

If anyone happens to keep track of my situation it's beyond appreciated and means a lot. There's a lot happening right now and I'd really appreciate taking the fatty text wall below one chunk at a time because I'm currently overwhelmed and am reaching out to my opi fam. So fuck... where to begin... 

The talk was nice. For those who didn't see, a girl I met at a party 1 year ago who I thought was a total bitch reached out to me asking to shed some light on being in active heroin addiction and all associated with it. Our mutual friend, the host of that party was with us. The three of us were laying about passing around wine bottles, getting drunk and having great conversation. The girl who I originally hated from that party 1 year ago asked me about needles, the progression of addiction, how the fuck you can knowingly make such terrible decisions and if it's safe to go back to her ex who was using behind her back for the entirety of a 2 year relationship. I explained to her how no addict has it in mind to become an addict and how quickly you find yourself in a hole you can only get so far out of. How her ex would never intentionally hurt her, and how while it is our fault and we ultimately chose the wrong choices every time, at one point a heroin addiction takes control and you become the embodiment of your flaws. You watch all the good things in your life begin to crash, burn and die in front of you, and you want so bad to make it all stop but the nature of this addiction won't let you off easy. You will ultimately lose or damage what you love and value in life, and try so hard to move back to how it was, but at one point there's no going back. It wasn't her fault, his addiction had nothing to do with her and he only wanted to spare her, which wasn't the right move but had good intentions when you boil it down. He is, like the rest of us, a prime example of the complexity and controversy associated with the heroin epidemic and there's simply so many factors we can't realistically expect to make sense of it. It's too early. 

He was one semester away from an impressive degree from a great university in our state, and so quickly lost everything and only gained felony charges and a sense of shame, unhappiness, confusion and frustration to accompany him on every path he will take from here. He's 1 month clean and wants to see her again, but I advised against it due to the high probability he'll pull her in and keep her there while he begins another round of destruction. She said he says he'll likely get high again and he's preparing for it. That's a red flag and she should stay the fuck away and let him destroy himself if that's what he wants to do to figure it out. It seems to be something most of us do before we find something concrete in recovery. Offer him the option of support, he only has to reach out and get it. If she is going out of her way and investing herself into helping him while he's on the brink of another run it will only be taxing her spiritually and mentally. If he really wants it he'll come get it, otherwise she'll only continue to take unnecessary damage. It's hard to set that boundary but so necessary. Good few hours and 2 cups of coffee later I drove her home and told her my story of where this whole mess began, and how I currently view all of it. She profusely thanked me and now looks at addiction in a new, understanding light and is coming to terms with her ex. 10/10 just as good as I had imagined. It's profound that she admitted lack of knowledge rather than make blatant assumptions, and went out of her to be properly educated by someone who has been there. I feel less cynical and hopeless about the general populations views, because before this i thought she was a closed minded cunt forever doomed to a life of narrow minded thinking. If she can so quickly change her views, anyone can. 

Okay sorry you guys have to read the bullshit I constantly lay out to you but here's the update on my charges. I removed my post about it almost 2 weeks ago after about 24 hours due to the fear of my identity being revealed on the chance that someone in my life happens to be on this sub. I was arrested on 10/20/17 for the first time. For those who missed it, basically I'm a dumbass and made a very small error which exploded into a 7 hour police custody shit show on a prestigious federal establishment. It was a whirlwind of fuckery fueled by 10 cops, 2 k9 units and the FBI that ended with multiple felony charges hanging over my head and losing my job with no possibly of future federal employment. I was on track to my dream career that would set me up for life, I would have had it in 1-2 years maximum, and now any chance of that is gone. 

I talked to an attorney I was going to hire today. He was very honest and helpful and I'm really glad I talked to him. Basically, he said my case is a complete shit show, and he won't argue if I go into debt to pay him to take my case, but as an attorney he wouldn't feel right taking it. He said it's definitely ugly and in order to not get jail or prison time (both are a possibility, depends on a couple different things) the cards have to be played just right, and he doesn't feel right taking it because it's so unstable he feels he'd fuck it up and accidently get me locked up for awhile. He said there are definitely fighting points but he wouldn't be suprised if I got a few years behind bars. The FBI guy keeps calling and texting me, and he's really pressuring me and I just want to go on the run, obviously I won't though. The attorney wishes me the best but admitted he isn't the man for the job and doesn't want to take my case. No chance of drug court and very unlikely chance of some variation of probation. I fucked up and it can't be argued, only punished. 

Okay, great. Awesome. Thanks. That's encouraging. I appreciate the honesty, but fuck me did I walk out of that office hoping a truck would hit me. I'm not a disrespectful punk, a dealer, or someone who blatantly doesn't care. The attorney said what they're doing is overkill for just a young man trying to get his shit together. I've always disliked the justice systems default solution to drug cases being incarceration and now I'm seeing the lack of sense first hand. Places in Europe are fucking around with decriminalization and punishment replaced with rehabilitation and life skills and they're seeing hopeful results. The US on the other hand is run by the powers that be, the corporations. There's too much money in throwing addicts in private prisons to change things so smoothly. It'll happen, probably not in my life time, but it will. We used to think it was normal to not let women vote and keep black people in cages, now we see how fucked it was. Generations down the line the unfairness of this system will be addressed, and they'll look at how we do things as fucking stupid just like we view how things used to be. We are experiencing the pain and damage with this design so future America doesn't have to. 

Fuck heroin, fuck IV drug addiction, fuck me, fuck the justice system, fuck early 21st century America societal design and fuck sacrifice for the greater good. Im going to make the best out of the pieces at hand, and I try to gain perspective rather than bitch, but I'm 20 and this is bullshit in every direction.

did it last as long as normal roxy 30s do? because my belief was that fentanyl had a shorter life than real oxy

how did you administer it? did it burn more than normal if nasal ect.

was the high different?

any description you can give of your experience please do! very curious as from my previous post i think i may have received fakes - but I just cant tell bc they look pretty fucking real. ",1509673268.0

Im in my first year of college now and my main goal is to not progress to stronger opiods no matter what plugs i stumble upon or even if anyone offers me anything stronger than hydros. I also use kratom, but irresponsibly as i use it to get high instead of using it to wean off opiods. I know that seems ridiculous for most of you with massive addictions and tolerances, but im content that mine is low. I am not greedy- yet. What i mean is that im happy with the high that my normal doses give me and i pray to god that i never find out how good oxy, dillies or opana etc could be. 

I know i have a bright future and an opiod addiction is treacherous, what should I do from here? I would really like to just switch to kratom solely and put down prescriptions for good. ",1509671833.0

I'm wondering if I missed a little? I doubt it but as soon as I injected I felt a warmth but it took 5-7 minutes to peak isn't IV instant?

Ther  wasn't much of a rush although a change. I do have tolerance though but haven't used oxy in a few days

https://www.medonthego.com/thumbnail.asp?file=assets/images/ab7333.jpg&maxx=500&maxy=0

Anyway my other needle is also ready with 30mg oxy but I screwed up because I used a 22g needle to draw testosterone propionate which is a oil and NOT meant for injection and then used the SAME 22g needle that I drew the testosterone propionate from to draw water and mix it with the oxy.

I noticed a little bit of oilyness in the liquid which was enough for me to not inject that.

Question, is it safe to inject it IV, Should I inject into a muscle, or is it possible to put the liquid in the nose and take it nasally? Anyway as I'm writing this 15 minutes from injection the high is definitely a lot stronger and noddier than snorting.

Is it possible to snort the liquid or can I just inject in a muscle?

Behold, a savage lost.   
-----------------







I spent a few hours laid over somewhere in the southwest and arrived at the airport late at night.  Roger and his girlfriend came from the city on the BART to pick me up and expected me to pay for the cab ride back to their hotel room.  The City mystified the boy who had only read about her in books and never lived anywhere but Louisiana.  This was where R. Crumb lived in the 60s and beautiful people had once worn flowers in their hair.  Jack Kerouac journeyed across the United States more than once to her and chronicled the adventures in On the Road.  This was where Ken Kesey and his Merry Pranksters held some of the first acid tests, and Andre Nickatina sold crack over his Blackberry cellphone.  The city held untold adventure in her streets, and I would discover it.  At the hotel I paid the driver, and we loaded my bags into their room.

‚ÄúRoger, when can you get some acid?  When can we trip?‚Äù  I lit a cigarette on the balcony of their hotel room.

‚ÄúGive me a light.‚Äù  He held his head down until he pulled smoke into his lungs.  He lifted his face to me and let the smoke out of his mouth and nose.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.  Maybe soon, but you need to get settled.  Tomorrow we‚Äôll take you to the Red Cross to get your card and the hotel room.  We‚Äôre tired.‚Äù



In the morning we went and got things settled.  I put my 2300 dollars from FEMA in the Bank of America got a 300-dollar ATM card from the Red Cross and a room in a hotel next to one of our friends.  Pretty soon we would all move in together and grow weed, and I felt great hope and excitement about starting over and leaving behind the wreckage of Katrina.  I could reinvent myself and do amazing things, but when Roger and his girlfriend stayed in my room one night, we all took Xanax.  I journeyed to the Tenderloin to smoke crack and walked back to the room to steal 200 dollars from Roger‚Äôs girlfriend while she slept.

My legs hurt from walking up and down the hills, and when I got back to the room at seven, Roger woke up and entered the bathroom.  The clouds of steam and white noise came through the crack in the door, and his girlfriend looked frantically through her purse for her wallet.

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs my wallet?  Where is it?!?‚Äù

I stood sweaty in the corner with my shoes on like someone who had been smoking crack all night, and she looked confused and then like she hit bingo and then like she smelled excrement.  She walked into the bathroom to tell Roger that I took her money.  I threw her empty wallet behind the nightstand, and when she came out I asked,

‚ÄúOh, is this it?  What‚Äôs it doing here?‚Äù  She didn‚Äôt say anything when I handed it to her, and they left.  Roger banged on the door to wake me up in the dark a few hours later.

‚ÄúDude!  You better give her that money back!‚Äù

‚ÄúDog!  You know I got the money.  It‚Äôs in the bank.  I‚Äôll go tomorrow morning when they open.  First thing, and I‚Äôll give her 20 bucks extra.  I‚Äôm sorry, bro.  Xanax does me like that.  You know how I get.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah.  I know.  She‚Äôs mad.  So, Tomorrow?‚Äù

‚ÄúFirst thing.  I promise.  The banks aren‚Äôt open right now.  Tell her I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù

I was on my own.  They didn‚Äôt want to grow weed with me anymore.  They didn‚Äôt want to live with me either, and I couldn‚Äôt blame them.  I had no idea what to do with myself if not grow weed with them.

Roger sold me a sheet of acid, and that put my bank account at something like 1300 dollars from the original 2300 after one week in California.   I slipped into the fog of a mind laced with acid and watched VH1 videos play all night.  Sheryl Crow‚Äôs ‚ÄúGood is Good‚Äù video played over and over, and there was a knock at the door by daylight.  I opened to discover the wiry frame of a man I had smoked crack with a few nights before, and we smoked a bunch.  I stole 40 bucks from him when he passed out to go smoke some more in the middle of the night before the banks opened, but when I came back he woke up.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not leaving, till you get me my money!‚Äù

‚ÄúNo problem.  I have money in the bank.  Just let me go get it.‚Äù  I left the room with my jacket, my skateboard, my passport, my phone and the promise to pay him back.  Everything else I owned was in that room, but when I found out that the banks were closed for Columbus Day, I knew I couldn‚Äôt pay him.  The only things I found in the room when I got back 12 hours later were the sheet of acid in the drawer and a streak of feces on my pillow case.  The Cambodian maid who cleaned my room chastised me for getting robbed and told me how she tried to stop the guy.  It hurt her to see me controlled by drugs, but that was life for me.  I never thought about it much.

After that I smoked meth in my hotel room and went to sell the sheet of acid with one of the street people helping me get meth.  My accomplice sent me into the store to buy a Three Musketeers bar for him while he waited for the buyer in the parking lot, but when I came out he was gone.  The candy bar was no consolation to the loss of the acid.  My mouth was too dry from meth to eat it.  There was no milk, and I hated nougat besides.

Back in my room, a man who dressed like the Terminator spoke dark poetry and injected the meth into my arm with a needle that he pulled out of his boot.  It was the first time I used it much and still had not learned how to shoot myself up.  I also didn‚Äôt know where to buy any, but the sociopath in black leather did.  Hits of quality crank hammered my mind into hamburger meat, and I lost it.

The hotel sat on a beach on the Florida coast in my delusion, and strange junkies and random speed freaks owned the room.  It was not mine anymore but theirs.  Large men with stubble, breasts, beautiful hair and acne laughed like donkeys neighing and passed meth pipes around the room.  I cowered in the corner, my mind feeble and fragmented.  Sometimes I would watch the activities in my room through the window standing barefoot in the cold.  The infancy of a new day would lay the first layers of its blue luminescence on everything.  I wondered if they would be kind enough to let me in out of the cold.

I woke up to an old episode of cops flickering blue on the TV and muted in a cloud of bad breath and meth smoke a week after the man in black shot me up the first time.  The lampshades hung crooked off their posts with random articles of clothing to partially block the light.  The man in black leather and a couple of other people I didn‚Äôt recognize hung off the bed and chairs like wet dish towels.  Management kicked me out as soon as they saw me.

The Red Cross put me up in a hotel room in Chinatown, and I spent a week floating around with a pair of bolt cutters and a guy who couldn‚Äôt decide if his name was Chet or Chad.  He always insisted that he wasn‚Äôt my homeboy and that I ought to quit referring to him as such.

One day I came back to the hotel and found white silhouettes on the wall where the TV and dresser once sat against it. The phone had been ripped out of the wall, and the mattress was gone too.  Turned out, he wasn‚Äôt my homeboy after all.

Back home friends and family told me the law was looking for me, so I disappeared into the streets.  I had been robbed for all I had three times in my first three weeks away from home, and I had nowhere to go in a strange city.

Really being homeless for the first time in my life scared me.  A few hours after I first became homeless my father called me.  We hadn‚Äôt really talked since that day that we got into it at the clinic, and all he had heard of me was what my friends told him about me on the needle.  He told me that he, my sister and my mother had a head on collision on Thanksgiving Day heading to his mom‚Äôs house.  He said that they were in ambulances and that his arm hurt, my mom‚Äôs neck was broken and my sister had amnesia.  I got the phone call by Civic Center Plaza, and this man on roller skates wore a pair of sunglasses and denim short shorts and headphones.  He danced in a state of drug-induced euphoria.  My heart broke, and I felt such pain and fear.  I bawled right there in front of everyone, and the man on roller skates stopped to give me a puzzled look, as if to say, ‚ÄúThese are the streets, man.  We don‚Äôt do that here.‚Äù

I became a particle of dust floating in the dark below skyscraper monsters, and the city was an organism.  Streets called veins pumped us around the city like some sort of carcinogenic sludge the organism needed to excrete but couldn‚Äôt.  An unfriendly haze of pollution and mental illness sat on the city, and there was a cold rain that fell in icy sheets or a deafening drizzle.  My mind wilted in the rain.  I used my imagination to pass the time and pretended to be a frontiersman blazing trails through the treacherous mountains of the city.  Sometimes I stalked the hills around imaginary medieval villages like Grendel devouring sheep and giving children nightmares.

Down at the open air insane asylum called the Tenderloin, an angry black guy held a pimply and bald headed, Philippine man by the neck against a wall and tried to pimp him out to passersby.  A 300-pound transsexual sat on a crate between two cars and serviced another man who smoked his crack pipe freely.  A block down one street was where we sat our backs to a chain link fence and injected our drugs.  Mexican fences bought two cans of instant coffee for five bucks, a large can of Crew hair product for three and tubes of toothpaste for one.  Men called out whatever drug they had for sale, and in the 24-hour Carl‚Äôs Jr. another transsexual used tweezers to pick at her eyebrow shaped scabs and looked intently into her pocket mirror.  I refused her offer to eat the squishy grapes rolling around in a dirty grocery bag.  Another man asked me what JFK was doing in the Tenderloin and laughed.  Men and women walked by spouting gibberish like radios scrolling through the dial.  Others waited in silence for Skynet to take over.

Another corner was about the same in terms of the open sale of drugs and insanity, and I learned to spend my days and nights fooling the front desks of the welfare hotels to get out of the rain.  Damp stairwells gave me a place to turn the crook of my arm into a pincushion privately as I taught myself to register blood.  Staph and schizophrenia crawled on the walls, and I sat in wonder that people lived in places like this before I realized that it would have been a step up from where I was in life.  Sooner or later hotel management would find me and scream at me in a foreign language until they pushed me out of the front gate and back into the elements.

A certain societal imbalance marked all my dealings and time in the city.  It was a place where men‚Äôs consciences went unchecked by the presence of females, because they had long since cast off the standards of moral decency demanded by their mothers, sisters, daughter or what were now sure to be estranged wives.   Consider the things men do in prison and the old book, ‚ÄúThe Lord of the Flies.‚Äù  The boys who survive the plane crash in the book worship an impaled boar‚Äôs head.  They separate into tribes, and  they burn the island, until they are found by rescuers hunting each other for sport.

There are certain advantages that come from such complete moral abandon, and it isn‚Äôt hard to figure out what a 19-year-old homeless dope fiend does to survive in that environment.  He does the kind of things that involve old men getting on their knees behind some back alley dumpster before they spit their dentures out and press their foreheads into the young man‚Äôs belly button.  Gagging and choking and slobbering.  I was no stranger to those things, and I lost a bit of myself every time.


On another night a beautiful and slender Asian lady, maybe 25 years old and found me in the rain.  She wore a tight black dress and looked delicate and distressed.  I crouched with my back against the wall of her building‚Äôs front door entrance when our eyes met.  I desperately desired the touch of a woman after so much time in the City.  She was beautiful, and her eyes said it all so I stood up to kiss her by the door.

I knew where I was and what that might mean about her and for me.  But I was so thirsty for the taste of a woman‚Äôs lips and hungry for soft skin.  Her perfume filled my nostrils.  As soon as we kissed I knew it wasn‚Äôt what I had hoped, but long hair between my fingers and her breasts in my hands sold me on the deal.

Inside of the apartment, her penis was a great disappointment, but we made the most of it.  In the morning she gave me a five-dollar bill and sent me back into the freezing rain.  It was about 10 o‚Äôclock, and I took shelter in a KFC where I bought some chicken and a biscuit.


After two months of hard living on the streets my dad came to visit and, we rented a car to drive down the coast.  We saw Cannery Row and ate at a restaurant where he talked to the waiter about getting an education in California.  He bought me a new skateboard, a Northface hiking bag and a Kangol cap.  It was weird to have him there and for him to watch me interact with the homeless junkies throughout the city.

He smoked weed with me by Golden Gate Park, and I threatened the life of a guy who had ripped me off some weeks before.  After that I tried to show my dad how to read the bus stop maps while we were stoned and how I got around the city as a homeless person.  He had money, and he didn‚Äôt want to take the bus so he called a cab that took us back to the room.  Sometimes marijuana will show you the way things really are, and the way things really were that night was too much for him.  He wanted to go home that night.  He wanted to get out of the nightmare that I was living in.  After 3 days of trying not to be too disappointed and making the most of it, he gave me 200 dollars and told me that he loved me before he took off in a cab to the airport.  

After the visit and the never-ending bombardment of men who wanted sex from me, I wanted a regular friend and found it in a kid named Cody.  He was 33 years old, but I called him a kid, because he seemed like one. He came across me in the middle of the street, delirious from no sleep and struggling to skateboard.  It was 4 a.m., and he took me back to his squat where he gave me a shot of heroin and told me I could sleep on the couch.

It was odd inside of his room, like we crawled through a doorway in his eardrum and into his mind riddled with holes.  We went back in time to the era when punk turned into grunge in the ether of his room.  He was the same kid who had run away from home at 14 in black combat boots and the denim jacket with spikes and the sleeves cut off.  Even though he was 33 now, he saw himself the way he was in 1991.  The radio in his room would have played the newest Nirvana or Blind Melon, and any newspapers would have told of the Soviet Union‚Äôs collapse.

All that he could see he stole.  He filled up his garage-like room with useless electronics and other things he scavenged from doorsteps around the city.  He squawked every word he spoke and had purple track marks that ran up and down his arms and neck like the stitched seems of a stuffed drawstring doll.  His wood glued Mohawk matched the chain from his septum to his earlobe, and pinpricked pupils revealed his ravaged soul.  Preoccupation with heroin eclipsed everything else.  He didn‚Äôt seem to notice that his teeth were gone or that the last 15 years had passed.  I was 19, and I wanted to be just like him.

We did heroin every day and lots of it, so runny noses, diarrhea, anxiety and flu like symptoms followed Cody and me wherever we went.  That is until we fixed up.  We bombed down hills at night on our skateboards high on meth and heroin.  Hood ornaments from vandalized cars jangled and shined on the chains that hung from our waists.  We howled and barked like dogs at the people walking by and tore through traffic on wet streets in the fog.  Falling meant dying, and we pushed it harder every chance we got.  We hung off of the back bumpers of trucks heading up the hills like skiers on a lift and ripped back down the pavement.

Sometimes we would go sit on a bench, so he could play guitar and let his voice echo in the empty dark between buildings.  Zombie crack heads laughed at his singing and the sight of us.  We were invincible and intimidating as Vikings all night long but when the sun came up, we came down.  Then, our backs hurt and we rode the ferry to work, where we groaned through painful labor and regretted every moment of the night before.  In the evening, we rode the ferry back to the city with our noses running.  We got our fix and did it all over again.

The city was my mother, and I was her child, an infant birthed into heartlessness, formed in a rancid womb.  She had no milk for me to drink.  She had no love to give, because cold concrete and sidewalks cannot nurture you.  They can only make you hard.

I knew another guy who lived on the third floor of the King George Hotel, and when Cody and the goons that lived in his squat had enough of me I would spend the night at the King George.  He was a witch and one of the guys who always tried to get me to have sex with him.  Once I crashed out for three days and nights after a runner, and the few times I woke up he passed burning incense over me and did incantations.  He told me that burning jasmine brought unity between people, but I didn‚Äôt believe him or care.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm a witch, you know that right?‚Äù  He asked me with a feminine and conceited wag of the head.

‚ÄúNo.  Don‚Äôt you mean warlock, or something?  Aren‚Äôt witches women?‚Äù  I was pretty sure that women were witches, but he seemed feminine enough.  Who was I to say what he was anyway?  I didn‚Äôt know.

‚ÄúNo.  I‚Äôm a witch.  See my altar?‚Äù  He pointed to a glass table on the side of his TV with large rocks and crystals, a mortar and pestle, odd figurines made of shiny metal and crumbling arrangements of earthy herbs.  He told me about how he cursed some woman for touching his altar against his wishes and how she was afraid of him after that.  ‚ÄúI got a picture of her head and put it in my mirror box, and then next time I saw her, she was terrified of me.‚Äù

He asked me to get him a 20-dollar bag of meth one night, which went wrong, and the whole incident reminds me of this joke.  Instead of keeping plans or being on time, meth addicts would rather spend the week trying to turn the toaster into a time machine and go back in time to keep their missed obligations.  We called our inability to keep appointments or distinguish 30 minutes from three days: tweeker time, and I was guilty of it as anyone.

But like I was saying, the witch wanted me to score for him, so I came over, left my stuff in his room and took off on my skateboard.  He seemed upset when I showed up three days later with a perfectly good excuse and 60 dollars‚Äô worth to make up for it, and in front of the many pedestrians he screamed loudly about our deal and the drugs I had on me. I grabbed his collar and pulled his nose close until it touched mine, before I politely asked him to, ‚Äúshut the f*** up!‚Äô

He broke free and ran up to his apartment.  I skated down the hill and found Cody who helped me sell a 20 out of the 60.  Then I did the rest of it and hid my mind in a cloud of murderous thoughts.  At some point I called him about the incident to tell him I would have the money in the morning, but he threatened to keep the things my father gave me on his visit and said he would never give them back.

It was eight o‚Äôclock when his hotel opened for visitors, and I checked in with management first thing.  On the third floor of the King George his door swung open with a touch of my finger to reveal him laid out on his bed and various bottles of malt liquor around the room.  I threw the 20 at his head and told him,

‚ÄúThere is your 20 back.  I‚Äôm getting my stuff and I‚Äôm out.  See you later!‚Äù  He woke up.

‚ÄúWhat?  It‚Äôs my birthday!‚Äù  There was a hurt in his voice, probably from all the times that I turned him down for sex.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm getting my stuff and I‚Äôm out.  Your 20 is in your bed with you.‚Äù

He jumped to his feet and tried to stab me in the head with a brass letter opener, but I ducked, and he over swung.  It was too easy to beat him up after he had fallen backwards into my arms like that.

I made a figure four with my legs around his torso and ratcheted it tight to squeeze the air out of him.  The hard bones in my wrists and forearms caught him at the gum under his lip and scraped up backwards into his nose and over his entire face.  Porcelain figurines crashed with the glass shelves by his TV and altar.  He turned right, and I beat him in the face with my right fist and forearm.  He turned left to get a beating that way too.  It was his mistake to try keeping the things my father bought me.  I thought I would kill him.  When he tried to call the police I took the cell phone from him and threw it out of the third story window.  He screamed, and the neighbors called the cops before I jumped off him and sat in the hallway waiting for the police.



Soon after that Cody‚Äôs squat and everyone in it got evicted after years of the landlords trying to do it legally.  There was no place for me to stay so I bounced around town until I got a phone call one day.  I had just come from getting hassled by the police and spilling a cooker full of goofballs (meth and heroin mixed) on the side of a shopping cart in the Central Business District.  A cop said he got a call about us openly using needles on the sidewalk and that he was there to check it out.  My friend pulled out his syringe and showed the cop that he used it to suck the purple fluid out of the sores that covered his legs with a demonstration.  The cop‚Äôs chin and lips quivered, revolted by what he saw before he told us to take off, and I went to sit on a bench at Embarcadero.  That‚Äôs when my phone rang and showed a weird 505 area code.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù

‚ÄúHay-low, Rah Lee?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.  This is Riley.  Who‚Äôs this?‚Äù

‚ÄúCheo!  You mom‚Äôs fren.‚Äù

Cheo offered me a place to stay with him in New Mexico and get sober and maybe go to school.  I agreed to go.  Looking back I giggle a little bit.  He had no idea what he was getting into.  Fact is my personal problems were a bitter mouthful of dry grit he would struggle to chew, much less swallow.  A faceless voice to me then, he became one of my best friends, and other than my father and mother no one tried harder to get me sober and happy.

On December 26th my mom came with my little sister and her mother to get me off the streets, and I met them in the lobby of one of the ritzier hotels by Union Square.  They were happy to see me and seemed to think that I would look worse.  Cody and I kept doing heroin during the day, and my mom let him stay in the room with me while she stayed with my sister and her mom next door.  In the morning they took us to eat breakfast, and all three laughed at Cody as he nodded out and drooled at the table in front of his omelet, link sausages, bacon strips, hash browns with extra cheese and two scoops of chocolate covered ice cream melting on a short stack of pancakes.  My grandmother laughed hardest of all.  After that, my mom bought me all new gear, and I said good-bye to Cody and my mom at the airport and left to meet Cheo in New Mexico.

He met me at the airport in a green military cap and corduroy pants, before he took me to get a soggy burrito and put me up at a hotel for the night.  I spent the next several months in New Mexico covered from my feet to my belly button in a horrible rash of pocks that began where the witch bit my arm.  I swore that it was a curse he put on me.

That first night in New Mexico, a fevered heroin darkness played the background to my dreams.  A terrifying reality choked me and startled me awake in that hotel room.  There was no getting a fix to make the sickness go away. I would not get well, not this time.

So I thought I'd  give you guys a update and say it was a success! 

So I arrived in Southern Europe the other day and had googled and read articles about heroin use in the city. Having done some research and I read about a train station where there's a lot of drug use. So I went to this station and did some reconnaissance. So I posted up near the exit and people watched. What I noticed was all the junkies I saw would go down this street right by the exit. So I walked down this street, which was very short(literally a 2 minute walk). I stayed around for a while but couldn't find anything, so i decided to head back to my hostel and wasn't able to return because it was late(and no way I'm going at night).

So next day I head over and see the same thing. Still saw these junkies walking down the same street. So i decided to follow them at a safe distance. There was one group of two and a solo guy. I'm following them and they just disappeared as I turned a corner. I didn't want to keep walking down the road because I figured there may lookouts and I didnt want to seem suspious. No idea where they went so once again I was discouraged. So I exit the the road and sit at a bench at a small park near the road. I figure I'd sit and chain smoke and hopefully a junkie would ask me for a cigarette and maybe help me out. I should also add I had studied the language for a while at school so i spoke a decent amount, but definitely not fluent. After 15 minutes an indian guy comes up to me and asks for 50 cents so he could get bread roll to eat. So i listen to his story and then ask him if I could ask a favor. I tell him I wanted to buy H and I knew this was the place but being an American I had no idea what I was doing.

So I told him I'd give him 10 euros if he could help me out. He asked me if I was police and whatnot but agrees to show me the way. So we go for a walk and he starts explaining how it works and whatnot. So we walk down the road and and theres this gate that is slightly cracked open then you turn and you're walking under the freeway.  We then come up to two sentinels and he explains if they don't know your face they interrogate and frisk you. We walk up to the sentinels and he tells them I'm with him and we pass. As we're walking the path there are literally just dozens of junkies passing by in both directions. So we make it to this gate where there are a good 50-75 people. We arrive at the location which is a gate by the railroad tracks. There are a good 10 or so dealers all on the other side of the gate sitting in foldup chairs with scales in front of them placed on the gate and the junkies on the other side in lines. There was coke, heroin,  methadone and probably some other stuff.  Never seen anything like it, literally it was like being at walmart haha with people just lining up at their dealer. He tells me he knowss the best guy for what I want, we go up, and I copped a gram for 20 euros( like 23-24 US dollars) i'm from the west coast so i've only ever seen tar. This was a light brown, like kief, but pretty hard. I've had tar that was similiar but it definitely was not tar. Anyways, it's not the best shit ive had but it definitely was decent, i'd say 7/10. Never seen an open air market so it was definitely a crazy experience and it's so nice to get high again. ",1509649468.0

His mood is spontaneous depending on his usage which obviously causes some serious conflicts. He has been bringing his girlfriend over to our parents house for about a year now and it's safe to say that their relationship is unhealthy, for a time they were at a point where they would regularly yell at eachother in our household to try win an argument over issues which were trivial in nature, his girlfriend has some serious behavioral issues and is incredibly insecure. My brother has already gone as far as attempting to win their arguments by physical means on more than one occasion, surprisingly since that's happened it's been played off as just normal behavior by not only them but my family.

My parents apathy towards my brothers decade long opiate usage and the associated problems with it have made them numb to the issues at hand, this is a large part why my brother and his girlfriend are able to continue their drama within our home which is further complicated by the fact that most of the audible noise and conflicts they regularly engage in are unable to be heard by my parents who reside in rooms farther away than my own.

My parents feel that, despite this girls toxic behavior, this situation is a distraction for my brothers drug usage but unfortunately he uses just as much if not more due to the constant conflicts my brother is in. It's a daily occurrence to find him in the bathroom for 1+ hour at a time, multiple times a day, as he smokes and nods off. 

Just the other day I confronted them as they argued in his room which led to a huge argument which brought my parents into it as I called him out for his incredible disrespect to the household by continuing to argue in it, he responded with profanities on how I was being a bitch by involving our parents. We've been through this exact situation over five times so far and although my parents side with me that he and his girlfriend need to stop their excessive arguing they refuse to ban her from the house which results in reoccurring incidents. Every time me and my brother get into it he starts calling out all of my lifes biggest failures and is incredibly toxic, to be honest I'm not sure we'll ever resolve our relationship once we are no longer in the same household and feel that I will morally have no choice but to become estranged with him. 

TLDR: Family has mostly given up on trying to help my brother quit his black tar heroin addiction after trying for over a decade, brother is emotionally unstable and has been bringing his girlfriend to our home who is also emotionally unstable resulting in frequent conflicts between them reducing the families quality of life. I regularly confront them in the middle of their conflicts which results in a conflict between me and my brother often dragging our parents into it but they won't commit to banning this girl from coming into the home despite her ongoing decision to engage my brother in loud exchanges.

Green bag (no picture but they're plain and green) have also been linked to at least one OD and is also positive for fentanyl.

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE take a test dose and use with someone else who is trained in narcan. If you both are using, PLEASE stagger your use so one of you can save the other if necessary.


------------------------------

Usually I'm in a pretty big hurry posting these alerts, but today I'm going to provide a short but educational story w/ some important data. I know drug use patterns and markets are usually pretty local; however, I've seen the data in a few other localities and have lived/know folks that use in a few other areas so I think this warning is pretty generalizable.

On Tuesday, a friend nearly OD'd in an apartment stairwell after doing three bags-- what they thought was well within their tolerance because they aren't experienced using solo. It wasn't. But they knew even beforehand that it was likely fent-- not only because of the general knowledge that most things are fent, but because they noted the coloration went straight from white to light brown (not sure if this is actually a fact-based reason, though). Fortunately someone went to check up on them.

That night someone got their hands on the same stamp and a fent test was conducted-- it was positive, of course. And yet the coloration was reportedly a different shade than before when mixed. The person in question didn't OD, by the way, but they had immediate all-over pins and needles and it was reportedly an overall nauseating experience.

The alert went up locally for Lucky 7s yesterday. Today, we've already had at least four ODs in our area-- Lucky 7s were involved at least twice (Green bags reportedly involved in the third). I've also heard word of two ODs in a nearby Jersey town who would've likely gotten their works from this area.

What I've been finding out about the local business is very, very worrying. Someone can pick up 5 bags from one person, and each of those will have drastically different amounts. I can only assume these bags are poorly mixed as well-- some may be pure fent, some may be basically filler/ codeine/ whatever else. I know most gauge their usage/ tolerance in number of bags, and this is why I'm particularly frightened about this development. I've never known of such poorly dosed work, and this is an issue being seen across several local networks. 

Aside from this observation, the most recent fully-analyzed OD death data in one of the Ohio counties showed that only 6% of deaths involved heroin. 90% involved fentanyl, and nearly 50% involved acryl fentanyl. There were more benzo-related deaths than prescription opioid-related deaths. In other words--- it's essentially confirmed that there is very, very little heroin in that area and likely scarce legitimate prescription opioids on the street level (which I'm sure have extreme price mark-ups). Instead, we are seeing hodgepodge powders sold as heroin, and I am convinced that most available street pills are illicitly pressed with similar homemade formulations that likely include not only synthetic opioids like fentanyl, but benzo powders (and I'm sure other depressant/sedative-like drugs) that are more readily available. 

So PLEASE be careful in general and especially with new sources, batches, etc.-- these positive tests really don't mean much nowadays when essentially everything is synthetic and not heroin, plus the added fact that the same bags will have drastic variation in potency. 

Some-- maybe even most-- of this information may be obvious. Frankly the pressed pills and fentanyls are nothing new at this point. But there is now data to confirm some of these emerging concerns. I never thought I'd be someone to warn of ""dangerous doses""; in fact, I've always argued this sort of hysteria goes against the narrative that heroin-related deaths are historically the result of mixing. But it has been rather clear for awhile that the opioid clamp-down coupled with the increased accessibility of synthetic powders via online marketplaces and home-made manufacture is changing this, and this makes me extremely worried for anyone who is not especially knowledgeable about their dosage and source.

I can't find information on why this happens so I was wondering if there was information here, anecdotal or not

I took 100mg almost 12 hours ago now, so almost two half-lives, and a small dose to begin with. Honestly I'll probably end up taking it and report the results but if it is a waste I'm hoping someone can warn me first

EDIT: Right so I took 15 mg of oxynorm parachuted, I've been having a shittone of white grapefruit juice since T-45 and am on my usual benzo doses of 1mg clonazepam and 1.5mg etizolam. Plus from advice from the first google search result for ""oxycodone potentiation reddit"" at T-0:30 I had 20mg of DXM HBr (love DXM as a drug, first plateaus with music and weed are fantastic), and at T-0:20 had 1.5 tbps baking soda, idk if that mixed with water was meant to be disgusting but I was irritated that it was making me nauseous before I'd even dosed. Felt better after a few huge burps around the time I dosed, had a 20mg cap but didn't want to take that much with my benzos, harm reduction and all. I'm also pretty much constantly on weed, althought since i couldn't have any during the day today I've had a T-break (usually permanently fried) so while I was feelng pretty good at T+1:30, after vaporizing Silver Haze till around T2+10 I am now a mess. I'm taking absolute ages to type this and have to go back to correct typos every couple words or so. Plus nothing of what I've written sounds like me. Physical euphoria is strong. Thought tangents and positivity at a time when I really fuckin needed it. Itching too, only antihistamine around is cetirizine so had some of that at T+2. Less than at high doses of tramadol though for some reason, making it much more pleasant overall. Will update if I rail the 5mg cause why the fuck not, somehting to do and I'm lonely, hence opiates

TL;DR:
It worked. I'm fucked.
For any future polydrug user wondering if they can have oxy stumbling across this from a search, go for it, I'm fucked. Got another 5mg to rail but don't even think I can, this is insane. I'm doing science, my parents should be proud :P",1509798647.0

I've been smoking gear for around 9 years. Since then, the longest I've been clean of all opiates has been about 10 months. At the moment I'm smoking about 0.2g/day, but, because of a recent introduction to the dark joys of the hidden net, I've been going through about 1g/3 days. I don't want this to escalate.

I also smoke a lot of weed and I'm partial to benzos, which the aforementioned access to DNMs doesn't exactly help, but at least *there* I'm not being ripped off by dboys and dodgy clearnet 'pharmacies'.

So my question is this:

Based on my usage, which opiate painkiller do you think it would be best for me to order so that I can divert my body away from the WD that getting off smack would engender; then taper usage of that opiate towards eventual cleanliness.?

I'm not from the states, so I'm really not that versed on which opiate is better for which condition/etc, but here are some caveats:

 - I **don't** want them combined with any other painkiller (APAP/Paracetamol/Ibuprofen/Aspirin, etc.) - my liver has taken enough damage from this

 - I can't have them being pills that will eventually increase my dependance on opiates (yeah I realise this is like finding a gold-shitting unicorn)

 - It can't be buprenorphine/subutex/naloxone - I was on this for a year and I've come to understand that opiate antagonists aren't the way forward for me.

I would really appreciate your help guys.

Thanks,

MK

But how exactly?,"So this question has already been asked and answered but there's a crucial part I'm missing.

As I see it you're supposed to do the following:

1. Take the #3 H, add some water and citric acid (roughly 1/5 of H)
2. Stir until dissolved

Now this would be fine for IV use but I want a snortable powder and every post seems to indicate different things happening.

If I apply slight heat from say, a lighter (not direct, just put it under whatever container I'm using), will this solution turn into a snortable powder? Is there something I'm missing or need to keep in mind with this process?

Can I do the entire batch at once or should this be done on a dose by dose basis? I ask this because some posts also said this process would turn the H into morphine somehow after a while.

Quick edit: I'm not looking to IV or smoke it. Not even looking to get high, this is just my ""best"" option for actual pain management for a few days, sadly. Nothing else around and docs don't provide proper pain meds here.

Final Edit: After trying just to snort #3 as is, turns out it's perfectly fine. I looked into it and apparently nasal mucus is slightly acidic enough, which I guess works out fine. Maybe a slightly wasteful, but whatever.",1509772566.0

This is actually what I've been doing for the past 6 months and I gotta say the difference to doing dope every single day is enormous. Now every time I get high it's without a tolerance. I used to need an 8mg suboxone just to feel well. Now I single 8mg suboxone is enough to get me zooted as fuck for *at least* three days, which is a nice deal since they only cost 15 bucks. I'd need at least 30-40 bucks worth of heroin to last that long. 


I never knew all the time I was on suboxone that it's actually a totally awesome drug when you don't have a tolerance to it. The effect is as strong as anything, the legs are ridiculously long, we're talking into the next day, there isn't as much itching and respiratory depression too. It really took me by surprise just how great it is. 


Anyway one of the benefits of not doing it all the time and leaving 3 to 5 day breaks in between using it is I don't get withdrawal at all. I gotta say, having experienced way too much withdrawal in my time, that that is a *huge* plus. I mean withdrawal basically ruins the experience doesn't it? It poisons everything good about it. 


I think the secret is you just have to learn fear withdrawal enough that you limit yourself to less than 3 days of usage at a time. When you think about it, 3 days is really long enough to spend nodding the fuck out anyway isn't it?

I have not used heroin in a few months, so my tolerance should be extremely low.

I thought about splitting the pill in 8 little 1 mg doses (is this achievable? Should I completely crush it instead?) and take 1 mg when I notice the first withdrawal effects. When the Subutex wears off, I would take another 1 mg or so and repeat until like 5-7 days have passed since my last dose of H. Then just stop the Subutex.

Edit: My Subutex has no naloxone in it. Another question: will the Subutex be enjoyable? Will I get high from it and experience euphoria? I could also get a 40 mg methadone pill to taper, would that work as well, I like sedation. So bupe might not be that enjoyable for me? I dunno.",1509765156.0

The title of my post somewhat sums up my current situation but here is my history. 

I'm a 42 year old female who owns my own home and until about a year ago was living a stable and mostly happy life. I worked full time, had a decent support system between friends and family and my drug use was non existent except for drinking a few nights a week and occasionally smoking pot. 

20 plus years ago when I was in college I partied very hard and there weren't any drugs I didn't try at least once. I became addicted to meth at the age of 20 and my boyfriend was a dealer and he eventually agreed to Shoot me up. Once I tried IV meth I never wanted to snort it again. 

We never shared needles and got new ones from the exchange twice weekly. I was very thin with very thin veins and to this day nurses in hospitals have trouble finding them so I never hit myself - my boyfriend had to shoot me up. About 6 months in to this I was physically exhausted and the skinniest girl in California so I willingly went to rehab and stopped. 

I moved to a different college and different state and started over. Met a pot dealer my first day at new university and he became my boyfriend for the next few years. A couple years into our relationship he started doing heroin. I was horrified at the idea but eventually I was given a line of it and told it was cocaine and snorted it. Of course I realized it was not cocaine pretty fast. Once I got past vomiting and being angry he lied to me and tricked me into doing H - I actually liked it a lot. And over the course of the next 8 months my life went on a downward spiral like it does for most junkies. Again we never reused needles and never shared them. 

I eventually got clean on my own after being addicted for 8 months. Cold turkey detox in my bed at my parents house. Was a week from hell but I got off it and never went back. Ever. 

Fast forward to a year ago. Ovarian cancer diagnosed. I've had two surgeries since then and am now cancer free. But 7 months ago I woke up in severe pain with fire in my joints and in my muscles. I went from running and exercising at the gym to barely being able to walk. Hips, knees, neck, elbows, fingers became swollen, arthritic and very painful. Literally overnight. I chalked it up to overdoing gardening and patio renovation. Tried resting for a week but my hips and knees were very painful and eventually my boyfriend took me to the ER. 

Spinal MRI and x rays revealed significant arthritis in my joints and my back. I'm 42 years old. The doctor explained it by saying the hysterectomy forced my body into early menopause and that triggered my body to start aging rapidly. I was speechless. He referred me to a rheumatologist. It took me a month to get in to see the specialist to have blood work done to test for rheumatoid arthritis. I was limping and barely able to stand up without assistance the whole month. Lots of pain and tears and trips to the ER for pain pills. 

That's when I got the shock of my life. Not only did he confirm RA he told me I had hepatitis C. Hepatitis C can cause rheumatoid arthritis. It can also cause neuropathy which I was diagnosed with years ago but I never knew where it came from. Now I know. When I was told I had hepatitis C I was waiting for my second tumor removal surgery. So there was nothing we could do about it. 

I developed a horribly painful case of gout that went undiagnosed for 2 months. Let me tell you gout is almost as painful as labor or having 10 pieces of metal hammered into your broken ankle bones. I couldn't walk I had to crawl to the bathroom. Gout is a form of arthritis. I was examined by 6 doctors and none of them recognized what was causing the red, swollen and very painful feet I had. So this was back in June. This is when I started on my current opiate addiction. The doctors would watch me screaming in pain and prescribe 20 Percocet. Pain pills were the only thing to relieve the gout pain so that I could walk. 

I had my hysterectomy and second tumor removal in July and it was hellish. I lost 20 lbs in a month due to pain. My oncologist only prescribed me 20 Percocet to get through a very long and complicated surgery that removed a grapefruit sized tumor and 4 organs. Which enraged me especially bc he knew I was already suffering from the RA and the mystery foot pain which ended up being DX as gout in august. So I started buying pain pills from friends but they are ridiculously expensive to buy on the street so I started snorting heroin for pain management.

When my pain from the surgery improved I asked to be tested for gout and it was confirmed. Still my doctors wouldn't prescribe me pain pills and told me I needed a pain management doctor. I tried to see a pain management doctor. His nurse said she researched all my recent trips to the ER for pain and she was turning me away from being a patient bc she thought I displayed med-seeking behavior. 

My muscles were on fire most of the time and I went back to my rheumatologist who then diagnosed me with fibromyalgia but told me he couldn't prescribe me anything bc of the hepatitis. The drugs to treat hepatitis C interact badly with drugs for auto immune disorders. And out of all my specialists who know I'm in legitimate pain none of them will prescribe me pain meds and I think it's due to the opioid crisis. 

I've been diagnosed with RA, fibromyalgia, neuropathy, gout and hepatitis C yet they won't give me anything for pain. I've never in my 42 years suffered from chronic pain and I've never needed or asked for pain pills in my life before this year. 

I had my fibroscan done last month on my liver and it revealed that I'm late stage 3 hepatitis almost stage 4. Which explains the arthritis and fibromyalgia and neuropathy. When hepatitis C goes undetected for decades and progresses to stage 3 it causes all those illnesses or creates pain that mimics RA and fibromyalgia. And its pure hell. 

So I've basically given up on any doctor doing anything to help alleviate the pain I'm in daily and I have been sniffing heroin and taking pain pills from friends for 5 months now. I started with a $10/day habit and now it takes about $25/day to keep me from getting sick. 

My best friend gives me 30-50 of her 8 mg dilaudid each month and they used to work great on my pain months ago but now I need 3 of them instead of 1. Opiate tolerance is awful. They are the only thing that help my pain but I can't financially afford this anymore. 

Heroin is expensive and so are the 10 mg hydrocodone and 10 mg oxycodone I can sometimes buy from friends. 

I've detoxed twice and it was hellish. I'm in so much physical pain with these illnesses that I can't stand going without pain killers or heroin longer than a week. 

My question is this - until the drugs arrive to kill the hepatitis-I am going to be in immense pain. I've accepted that. If I go on methadone or suboxone will those drugs help with the pain I'm in and also save me from another cold turkey detox? I can't afford this habit anymore.

anyway thanks for the nice messges and shit and i'll keep people updated on everything. i will probably be doing the TC a bit later, which is unaffiliated with this subreddit and its moderators, and has its own rules, moderators and etiquette that have nothing to do with this one. so if you're bored, [stop by](http://tinychat.com/ropiatesubchat) and hang out at http://tinychat.com/ropiatesubchat (for those who can't just link directly) which is still unaffiliated with this subreddit or anything else except for itself. listen to tunes, get things off your chest, or just treat your boredom. come on by.

He's a good kisser too. 



Yesterday I took my last exam for this semester and I don't have to work until Monday. a while ago I downloaded OkCupid and we texted. Then I deleted the app bc my phone blew up as any females phone does on a dating app. I didn't have the time to sort through all the messages between studying, working and my addiction. Today he texted me on whatsapp, saying he looked through his old phone and found our old chat. Today's my first real free day in aaaaages. So I said I was free and we could meet up. And we did. We went for Asian food and cocktails afterwards and it was really nice! Like nice nice. My last boyfriend was everything but a gentleman. He didn't hit me but he never gave a present either. Or any kind of validation tbh. 


Now, how should I tell him that my idea of fun is lying around, being suicidal, shooting speedballs? I mean, to whom is that not a deal breaker? :( should I tell him at all? Or should I wait and see what becomes of this? But if it gets serious, when is the right time for that and is there really ever a good time to tell someone you're a lowlife junkie? Gawd, I hate it so much but I love heroin (and coke & benzos) so much :'/ 



He smokes weed and tried ecstasy, shrooms and speed when he was younger but heroin? Nah man, he'll run like Forrest Gump as soon as he finds out, I bet. What if he asks about my track marks? 


Maybe I'll wait until tomorrow to find out how we go along in bed and maybe, if I'm interested in more, I'll try to tell. But I am interested in any normal person interested in me because I think I'm a horrible person. :( that's why a opted out of the dating game. This is emotionally just too exhausting. I can't take rejection. Has anyone been there? How did you dealt with it? How can one go about a normal life whilst addicted to fucking heroin? I rationalized it af but honestly, I situations like this I'm just so ashamed I stepped on this path and survived it. I. Never thought I'd have to organize my life around a needle and a spoon. :(

Girl gets in my car w recovery book then we go to Panera and she's shooting meth in the bathroom for 15 minutes.,"I just need to vent. I feel like I'm being pulled in a thousand directions by needy people that see when you're doing a little better, they take take take.

So I hung out with a chick. She is cool we're friends she has supposedly been sober since May. She said she wanted sober things to do and sober people to do them with. I just started methadone a week ago today and have dabbled a few times with h but I am losing interest bc it's too much work for too little gratification and I'm tired of being judged by my fucked up swollen hands and smeared eyeliner. 

So we go to this community center and play ping pong. Bc ping pong is actually awsome (learned in rehab lol) and we played with this lot of old asians that have been playing since they were 12 and are really good. It was a lot of fun. So she says she is on her period and goes to the bathroom. I go too and she's like ""I think there's another bathroom over there."" Alright. I knew something was up. She tried to say she was on her period. Yeah, right. Keep in mind her mom dropped her off (comes from wealthy fam) so she basically escaped sitting around her house and I guess had some fun and wanted to celebrate. 

So we decide to go shopping the next day. I go get my done dose and the bitch goes in there to say ""hi"" bc she used to be on it, except she caused a huge scene and they kicked her out 3 years ago. Great. Guilty by association. Then she has the balls to tell me not to talk to people at the methadone clinic when I see my high school friend. 

We go to Panera. She goes to bathroom while I order food and the lady even gave us extra bc she saw I was with another person. Very nice gesture, but she don't even eat the food. 15 mins later she comes out after I send her a text saying ""quit shooting dope in the bathroom and let's go.""

I am sitting there and finally walk out. She trails behind and pulls the ""where were you I was looking for you?"" I said don't pull that shit I just saw you come out. You're in there shooting meth all geeked out. I am going to exchange these clothes and drop you off. Big mistake. She goes into Sharper Image and tries SIX massagers one after the next and the sales associates are like wtf. She's asking if they have this/that and I'm like let's go. Her tweaked out ass is pawing at everything. I just walk out. 

Drop her off at her sub doctor. 

What a pos. You wanna get in my car and read me the Just For Today and then start crying over what you're putting your mom through. And then go shoot meth in Panera when we were supposed to do something to keep our minds OFF dope. I told her I understand we're addicts but I'm not trying to cart her around for a good time to celebrate getting out of her moms house for once. She proceeds to post some sobriety thing on Facebook lol. 

Next, my best friend from hs is ""stranded"" downtown. He walks to my house and *then* proceeds to tell me he couldn't find dope, took his dads $20 and went in the done clinic for 2 minutes then walked straight out so he could get high. Skipped his job. Dicked around all day. Gets to my house to tell me he's doing a cotton but shoots more meth. Asks me for dope. I forgot my methadone so I had a little and I HATE being around people on meth and at that point I was so like, fuck it all, I gave it some shit. He told me he went to the needle exchange but then lies and says he has no extra clean Riggs. Later he pulls out a bag of dope and clean Riggs. I HATE PEOPE. I JUST HATE THEM. I HATE THEM SO MUCH. Then asks for a ride to the bus stop once my bf gets home after working 10 hours, and asks if he will buy his food stamp card that won't hit til the 7th. I'm done with that one, don't even need to say nothing. Blocked the #.

While he's here another girl calls who, the last time she wanted to smoke. She stopped by and miraculously forgot she was out of weed. 

I am so sick of these people and I know it's my fault for putting myself around them. I'm tired of users. I just want to scream and I'm probably going to get a lot of shit comments that's just going to make my day worse but I just needed to type this out and I didn't wanna hand write it in my journal. I feel like I'm being pulled in every direction just by trying to get out and do active things. All the people I know are losers and then all the people in AA are clicky and like 21 and wanna do things like go to applebees. Where the fuck do I make friends it's so hard. 

I feel lost and unbalanced. I overslept my done dose yesterday. Ran out of gas bc I was late to a dr appt where this lady tried to charge me $40 for an ""assessment"" where all she tried to do was sell me acupuncture and write down my symptoms. Talking to her was like pulling fucking teeth I was so mad I callled back and bitched which I am embarrassed about bc I have to go back Monday and pick up this medicine. 

I'm in limbo between getting out of the junkie lifestyle. Having not cut the ties completely and the people around me supposedly sober are actually just undercover users. ""You have Spotify premium, let me get that password."" Yeah sure go fuck yourself. 

I want to tell everyone to fuck off. But then I'll have even less friends. I'm def telling these 3 to fuck off and ignoring them from now on but gosh. I just needed to vent. While I watch all the downvotes and *you're a stupid asshole and methadone sucks* comments roll in.

Anyways, I was reading different things online about how long it stays in your system. I know there are many factors like body fat, metabolism, how much is in your system, etc. I also saw that lab tests are more accurate and can detect for metabolites of the drug up to 7days.

Anyway, a big hello to everyone here, I guess this is my introduction....

Back in 1999, I was t-boned by a senior citizen that ran through a red light and smashed into me on the driver-side door, resulting in a broken arm and 3 broken ribs.  After 10 days in the hospital, I was discharged with a ""care package"" of 60 MS-Contin (30mg, twice daily) and was told to follow up with my primary care doctor.  I was 19 and on my own, going part time to community college, and busting my ass full-time waiting tables.  Anyone who has ever worked as a server/bartender/delivery driver knows about getting screwed over when it comes to benefits, mainly health insurance.  

To make a long story short, I ended up with an 80mg daily oxy habit after a few years. They were easy to get and cheap, but my dude got busted at a DUI checkpoint because the idiot cops thought they smelled ""weed"" (no weed, he smoked djarum clove cigarettes) and proceeded to search his car.  The phrase ""felony amounts"" definitely applied; 6 sealed bottles, each containing 100 80mg pills were found.

After 4 years of smooth sailing, not only was my friend locked up with no chance of making bail, but I started to get dope-sick with no backup.  The paradox with oxy is that when you're NOT taking it is the time when people think you ARE using.  I looked and felt like shit for a few days, and took time off work which made it even worse.

I found other venues, but was paying 4x more than I had been.  Apparently I had the best hook-up in town without knowing it.  That's when I realized that the harm with opiates wasn't really from a health standpoint, but in the financial ruin of just trying to maintain.  

Thankfully my habit was not horrible, I never did more than 80mg daily but I still felt like I was dying after a week.  I got over the physical withdrawal, but struggled to get myself out of the financial nightmare that had become my life. 

Fast-forward to today; I'm prescribed 2mg of bupe daily for chronic pain caused by the accident, but I usually split it into four pieces. Even .5 mg gives me the same relief that taking the whole 2mg pill does, so I've been able to help friends who are in the same position I was by giving them some of mine.  It also allows me to enjoy full agonists (ECP, other CIIs) responsibly and occasionally.  It's given me a new appreciation for substances I used to take for granted.

(Stomach discomfort, hungry but can't really eat solid food, and obviously cravings) I have 2 4mg Sublingual Suboxone strips for when i can't score and end up in withdrawal. So I decided to use half a strip (2mg)  Honestly, it was probably too early after last usage to use it but i hate even the first discomfort stage of withdrawals. So I researched IV sublingual subs and found a process that had a lot of positive feedback. Proceeded to IV 2mg sub and i felt somewhat of relief from cravings and stomach discomfort. Knowing that Suboxone has a blocker to opiates, I knew I couldn't use any dope. About 6 hours later I get a call from the Dgirl saying she needs a ride to her car and will give me either dope or gas money. Obviously I take the dope. She gave me half a gram, which excited me very much. I figured since I took the suboxone, there was no point in trying to do the dope and save it. But my junkie ass tries anyway and success! A .1 of dope and I get the rush, warm fuzzy feeling, and still feeling it while typing this. I don't get it though. Wasn't the suboxone supposed to block the dope? Was it because I IV'd the Sub and maybe filtered out the Naloxone? I am so confused on why I am feeling the dope. Don't get me wrong I am not upset at all! I just expected it to have been a waste.

Now I had been taken opiates for 10 years before I moved to a large  city . When I moved I moved here with no friends no money and a couple days worth of subs. I managed to get 28 days clean no subs and no opiates a little kratom. But I continued to search and search and search and well when you look hard enough your bound to find what your looking for. That first day of doing it I knew I was in trouble I felt so good I even remember thinking shit my tolerance is so low I can spend less on this than I am on kratom... it doesn‚Äôt take long for that to turn around and bite you in the ass. 

Now my year has not been ALL bad but boy it‚Äôs been far from good. I owe everyone and there mother money. I currently have 3 pawn loans out including the ring I planned to propose to my girl with. I woke up yesterday to a boot on my car fuck paying tickets I need dope. 

I‚Äôve overdrawn and subsequently lost all my checking accounts. I borrow from and lie to my gf on a daily basis and it makes me feel terrible. Like I feel god awful but I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll never change. My brothers credit score has been ruined because he co signed for my school loan and I have ran short on money the last 2 months cause...of dope...my well being take precedence over every thing and everyone in my life and that is a horrible thing to realize. 

I‚Äôve also been arrested this past year for the first time in my life and spent 24 hours in the godnawful shit hole that is Brooklyn Central Booking. Now I have a record...I have 15 days jail hanging over my head. And I still need to buy dope daily.  Luckily i don‚Äôt shoot but I need to change something in my life.  The cops pull me over for a light out and I get harassed about drugs in the car. Cause I FKd up abd they found empty bags in my pocket and wallet. 

I hope this is s cautionary tale to some one considering making that jump. Here 1 am one year later and my life is fucked. I can‚Äôt prooose to the love of my life. I can‚Äôt even by myself gas and cigs. Every bad thing that‚Äôs happened to me over the last year and even closer to 5 is due to heroin or opiates.

Fast forward 20 minutes and then some sketch guy comes up to me with a paper towel full of pills and says it‚Äôs $300 because it‚Äôs an expensive city  and that‚Äôs the price.

It's a really uninteresting tale, with not much to tell, but it really stuck in my mind and you'll come to understand why when you finish reading.


So, I really don't think there is any meth in my city whatsoever. It's the UK for a start, apart from some people may e importing a bit for personal use from the DNM, I doubt there is any here. We just don't have that sort of interest. No epidemic here like there is in the States.

 If there is, well..damn it's hard to find. No homeless people know about it or anyone that does it anywhere.. and homeless people know everything as all there is to do is gossip! ( I've been homeless fairly recently this year, I got to know a lot of people I still say hi to) I managed to get a hotel room one night and offered to share it with a person I got to know pretty well (*hesitant to say 'friend' when it comes to homeless people as they turn on you in a second). I told them not to mention that I got a room to anyone. There is a weird begging hierarchy where they will look down on people that have been in a hostel or had a room to stay in. Homeless means bottom of society, they believe that any public money is essentially there's . I know people that were beaten up because they were begging and still had a hostel and another that was staying with their parents. That's not TRUE homeless and therefore you shouldn't be begging.


Anyway.. where was I rambling to?




Yeah, so I was out one night and I bumped into a tall, thin, muscular black man with no shirt on, just underwear and socks. He believe that everyone he bumped into was his dealer and stopped literally everyone walking past him on  the street if they knew where Tina was. I guessed nobody understood what he meant, but I clocked it. He just needed a phone to call the guy . I asked if he also sold dark (H):to which he replied yes. I doubted the validity of this claim as the guy was off his head. Pouring sweat still (it was an Autumn night and not exactly warm out, so shirtless at night was pretty cold. The guy was jacked in something. It wasn't crack, definitely an amphetnof some kind. So I had to assume meth as he was asking for Tina (ie Crystal - Kristina).

So, the only thing so wrote out this entire story to say was that as he talked to people, he had one hand he was gesturing with as he spoke, and the other hand by his groin, so far, unproblematic. But as he spoke, he moved in closer and closer until he was speaking at your cheek and the hand he had still in front of him, kept brushing up against my crotch. At first I thought it was an honest mistake. He wasn't grabbing or froping, just so close that part of his body was pressing into mine.

I took a step back, he took a step forward and had his hand in the same position. I turned around and we walked onward. I had to follow him so we could eventually find this dealer and I could ask if he had the goods that I needed. 

In the next few hours of calling and chasing ghosts. Several conversations were had. Every time, he came in close and resumed that position. I never looked down to see if he was stroking or had his fingers out or was doing something sexual. I just assumed he made a fist and it was brushing against me. I tried to escape, but he was quick, like a bunny on crack and it always jumped into this close face to face position to talk. Most cold cops are successful, after some practice I now think I could score in most countries in the world. But tonight I backed the wrong horse. I wound up with fuck all, all the calls he made, I think he had been phoning completely wrong numbers all night and had been organising something completely different to what he and I both wanted. But he had got someone to come out and meet him (Not joking, the wires had gotten so crossed in communication, him trying to sort a meeting to get Tina and Boy. He'd been passed around and put on hold and somehow ordered a cake with writing. I imagine 'Congratulations Mother Tina on your new new baby boy) 

Fuck knows. I didn't stick around to find out how much weirder the night was going to get. It was gone 4am by this point and I had given up, get some broken rest and try again the next morning.

I have many many stories of cold cops and meeting strange people. But because of the unwanted touch in my special place. It really feels like sexual harassment in my head. Now I know why people would feel uncomfortable and violated. This was just pressure from an unfortunate position. Maybe he was gay and knew exactly what he was doing. But aim it was weird, creepy and stuck dwsp in my memory of unpleasant events.

Will I withdrawal when the bupe wears off?

Angel? Hell, I don't know what to call my friend's sibling but I'm glad we were able to work together. Last night my friend Chuck was sedated by benzos but when we finally spoke on the phone I confirmed that he was not successful in selling his benzos to get dope to break the monotany.


What he did do successfully is wreck the cheap composite wood TV stand in his room and at some point in the process really fucked up his LCD TV. The way he described this on the phone was weird.. I mean yeah of course part of it was a benzo-slur-lisp combo but it was what he was saying that got me spinning. One second I'm hearing that his TV is broken and that it's miserable being down to one remaining TV in his mom's room and then he's saying it kinda works. So is the TV broken or not? Apparently both. Guess my friend's room is a Shrodinger's box.

&nbsp;


Well, today in the late afternoon his sibling calls me saying the internet was out. They were concerned that their brother and I changed the code or something to block them out. Unrelatedly, Chuck and his sibling were having a dispute about missing perc 10's a day or two ago. Sometimes it's hard to keep track of who's doing what to who and when a tall tale is being uttered. Needless to say I don't know if Chuck's sibling lost 8 perc 10's, got them stolen or made up the occurence altogether to get money from his mom to stop the loud fighting.

&nbsp;


In all likelyhood Chuck was moving his TV or tripped while on benzos and this would explain the condition of the TV stand. Oh and the internet issue, thank godness it was simple. The collapse of the stand dislodged the power cord for the modem so it was a simple matter of plugging it back in.


&nbsp;

The internet is back up but while I'm here we might as well address the streaming issues. In the process my friend's sibling calls a few people and although a thirty minute wait became two hours, the guy showed up thirty minutes early from his final eta update. 


My friend's sibling bought me a sub for helping with her computer issues and because she knew I wasn't feeling quite 100%. This in turn guarantees that I'll come back to fix her laptop's overheating problem and run an ethernet cable straight to the upstairs room so that this patron saint of dopeness will have flawless internet connectivity in their bed room in contrast to the weakest signal in their cornet of the house.

&nbsp;

In the mean time I rigged a range extender and setup some streaming apps that worked flawlessly before my triumphant departure.


It was day one of oxy WD and I tapered so I figured I couldn't feel much worse and wasn't that bad off compared to other times. For example I've felt way shittier when I've went from binge on fent laced dope to zero a day later. This time wasn't like that but 59 degree temperatures felt too cold.


I might be able to handle the other symptoms but the cold really gets me the worst. I went to another friend's house for TV and a blunt after I recieved the sub and 3 mg had me feeling better inside of 40 minutes. I could almost swear that taking a bike ride accelerated the efficacy of the sub. Once I arrived at my destinate three miles later my appetite was back. By the time I departed to bike back home I felt much warmer and in the groove of things.

&nbsp;

It is my opionion that thanking Junkie Jesus for deliverance is warranted. I'm no longer dreading work tomorrow. I no longer have to wear extra layers to avoid the chills nor do I have to squirt water from my ass. All these good things that make me feel better because my friend's sibling had a heart and needed my assistance to re-establish their internet connectivity.

When I first started it was cool nothing to special besides the rush which is fucking awesome! 

Recently though I find myself not getting high. Today I decided to do a half gram shot for the first time hoping to have different results than what has been happening lately. 

Basically it was no different other than the rush being a little more intense and that taste I get in the back my throat. After about 15 minutes my rush fades away and I am left wanting to do another shot. 

I know the dope is good and it has good legs (I'm about to state what I think it means by good legs.) I find myself not getting sick until about 30-36hrs after my last shot. 

See what I am missing now is that euphoria.. That feeling that makes me talkative and want to clean the house etc. Before I started my IV use I never had a problem attaining that feeling from smoking. Now if I try and use my brain I can get a nice nod going but I'm missing all the other things that I enjoyed.

Basically my question being is this normal after IV use for awhile? Basically it just feels like I'm using just to stay well and I happen to have a small side effect of being able to catch a nod. If that's the case what makes IV use so much better? Sure I'm getting more % from a bioavailability stand point but I'm not feeling to much different from smoking and banging. 

Is the reason for most IV users to continue the rush? If so I think it's time for a break and go back to smoking again..",1509950299.0

For the first time in years, I‚Äôm doing pretty well. I‚Äôm in love, I‚Äôm repairing my relationships with family members, and I have the world‚Äôs best dogs (this cannot be understated). I feel like I‚Äôm gaining some traction. My only complaint is that I fucking hate my job. I‚Äôm doing what I‚Äôm trained to do, what I thought I wanted to do, and I hate it. After a lot of thought, I decided to go back to school. I want to do something I already know I love and have a passion for, rather than something I thought I‚Äôd be good at. Go figure, I‚Äôm decent at shit that I hate...and what use is that? So I thought, what do I love? Where‚Äôs the passion? I asked people close to me too. We all came to the same conclusion. I love drugs. It‚Äôs been a constant for me, for better or for worse. It‚Äôs really too bad I don‚Äôt love biomedical engineering or rocket science, right?

It‚Äôs true though. It‚Äôs not just opiates and it‚Äôs not just doing them. As a lot of people here are, I‚Äôm fascinated by the mechanics. Dosing, half-lives, the chemical composition, the ROAs, the habits, the addiction. The psychology of the user. The laws and policies in place. Everything. The idea of making a living studying drugs, learning about them, talking about them, teaching about them, and maybe even indirectly helping those struggling with them...it would be a dream. Thus my questions for you folks:

Is this a stupid idea? Would this be ‚Äútriggering‚Äù to you? Is this much exposure on a regular basis to something I‚Äôve struggled with bad news? I‚Äôm not trying to become a recovery counselor. I‚Äôm neither inspiring nor completely sober. Although I can say I‚Äôm 100% clean of opiates and never considered myself an addict, I still dabble/misuse/occasionally indulge in other things. I feel in control but I know how easy it is to slip away. So in your opinion, could going down this path just be ‚Äútoo much‚Äù? Thanks in advance for any input. Be safe.",1509939870.0

Well, today that did not happen. We ran out of gas on the side of I-65, a mere mile from our home exit, where we could have at least begged for a few dollars for gas to make it home. So I got out and got her to put it in gear and I started pushing. 

About that time, a kind Air Force veteran pulled over and asked us if we needed help. My girlfriend explained our situation, and this gentleman offered to run one of us to the gas station to fill up his gas can for us. We explained that we had no money, but this kind man did not care. He spent his own money to fill his jug up, and even gave my girl an extra 10 dollars! (Inb4 your bitch blew him for money posts)

...but that is not the Junkie Jesus part of the story. As I waited for them to return, I paced the side of the highway, looking for any drugs that some junkie who was being chased by police may have thrown out the window, without bothering to retrieve it later on. I always do this when walking the side of the road. 

I have never once found drugs. Ever. However, today I found a fucking perfectly functioning Samsung Galaxy 6! No cracked screen, no dents. Nada. It worked perfectly. I did a complete reset to factory settings, removed the SIM card, and we ran that bitch straight to Gamestop, where we got $89 for it! 

Fent dope guy always gives us a look out bag if we are bringing him business from someone else (aka middling), so we called him up, told him we had $60 of someone else's money who wanted a half G, plus we had $20 for ourselves. He told us he would throw us extra on top of our $20 bag to look out for us, and off we went back into the big city.

We ended up getting damn near an entire G for our troubles. If we had not ran out of gas on the interstate at that exact spot, had I not been pacing the road and looking for drugs, none of this would have happened. If that doesn't qualify as a Junkie Jesus moment, I don't know what does...

...and yes, I am a piece of shit for not even attempting to find out who the owner of the phone was to possibly return it to them. Fuck it, sue me. Junkies doing junkie shit. Go figure. Anyway, just wanted to share that with you all. Have a pleasant evening ladies and gentlemen!",1509928565.0

Making changes and such.,"So I'm beyond grateful that I'm one of those people who has the ability to when in a crisis high stakes situation, am able to keep calm and use rational thought. I don't panic and can look at the given situation at many angles, predict and asses the odds of different outcomes, form a strategy and quickly act on that strategy. Last night I yet again put myself in a terrible situation where this ability saved my ass. I'm also still clean in the sense that I'm not using and it's lit 10/10 will continue to abstain. 

I'm not going to tell the story right now because it's long and isn't the point of this post. I might later but probably not. I'm going to use some parts to illustrate the urgency to figure this out. Basically 4 of us were in a situation in the crime riddled skanky city just over the highway. Homegirl I know pretty decently, Homie I know even better, and FuckHead I had just met last night when things began and was a friend of Homie's. At one point Homie dips and flees into the middle of a field, and FuckHead decides to stay with us. 

I was in a position of responsibility given what we had to deal with, and I tried time and time again, so fucking hard to keep things on track, but due to FuckHeads terribly hidden goal of jacking my car and his persistence in making things as difficult as possible, there were two moments where I found myself forced to accept the nature of the situation and sell myself on the fact that I was going to have to stab this man to death in the middle of the nighttime streets of that fucked up city. He was giving me no other options. He also had a knife and an unknown weapon, and in those two moments where I was just acting to save my own life and about to drive my knife into the kill shot, homegirl acts on her decided strategy to change direction of the situation. I'm incredibly fortanute that she has the ability to think rationally in a crisis and we somehow to my disbelief played our cards just right, and acted as a team to play through to the end without anyone getting hurt or killed. 

The second time I was going to make my move and homegirl played off of me and saved the game, I can't shake that feeling. This time I was also out of car because I had shoved him and swung my knife in his face just enough to make him leap back and put distance between myself, homegirl and the car. I told him if he gets closer and continues to act entirely as a threat, I'm going to stab him to the ground right here and kill him in the street. Period. I don't want to but it's up to you, what are you going to do? He steps closer and says to just fucking stab him then. I say okay. Homegirl once again saves the game, but the feeling is still with me from when I was tensing my muscles, threw my shoulders back, right foot back left foot forward, stabbing arm drawn and in my head I was deciding whether or not I should go for his solar plexus or his neck. The first time I chose his neck because it was the most likely move to work, but this  time while I was deciding between the two and chose solar plexus and it just fucked me up. 

I hate this shit. It took several hours after it was over and done with to calm down, relieve myself of adrenaline and get myself out of survival mode. I don't want to hurt anybody and I tried so hard to keep myself out of that position and keep it on track, smooth and harmless. The escalation of events was entirely needless and only driven by his goal to jack my car and the strong grip meth psychosis has on him. At this point in my time stupidly immersing in street running, every situation with the nature of the one last night I've been incredibly fortanute. Any day, any situation could be the one where I don't make it out alive. It's going to happen if I continue. 

So why the fuck is it so difficult for me to get away from that scene? All of my sober friends for whatever reason dropped me as soon as I got clean with no want for me back. So who the fuck does that leave me with? All those fuckers out there, doing shit like last night. I'll be anchored to this town and area until however my court case plays out is over, but behavioral patterns and routines are largely based on environment. In this environment, street running is what I know and have concretely established over years of reinforcement. I need to get the fuck out, it's much easier to establish behavioral patterns and routines with a clean slate rather than completely revamp to the opposite of what you already have established. It's so against the grain and uphill. 

How in the fuck do I do that? I've done meetings, used to have sober friends, avoiding town completely, ignoring people, but I can't get the momentum going and I always find myself back in my old ways. This is terrifying because while I'm rockin and rollin through being clean right now, old patterns and behaviors all attract each other. I feel like if I don't entirely revamp my lifestyle, I'm going to use again, and that's the last thing that I want. Where the fuck do I start and how do I progress in a way that maximizes odds of success? I'm sorry if this is all ridiculous but it's a genuine thing I'm struggling to conquer.",1509924094.0

Relapsed for 5 days straight. Luckily my withdrawal isn't as bad as it has been in the past (I'm sure ur familiar with bad CT withdrawl) 
Today is my first day clean. Aside from really bad anxiety, fatigue, slight chills, irritability it's a walk in the park compared to my previous detoxes which were hell. 

I've never had a problem with Xanax , diazepam or gabapentin. To me they're not really recreational at all but have huge medical benefits for wd... but I have a fairly large stash of all of these for times like these. 

I was wondering which out of these options I have works the best for withdrawl &/or cravings. I also have some weed which I've been using. 
I find them each to have their own benefits. Clonodine helps too but not in the day unless I want to be a zombie. Only really helps for sleep. When in wd I even lave low blood pressure apparently so dr said not to take clonodine in the day. Glad he said that as it just puts me to sleep. 

I have 20 x 300mg caps of gabapentin. 
10 x 5mg diazepam pills & 29 x 10mg diazepam 
I also have 16mg of  Suboxone left which I've used for a taper before successfully but since I only relapsed 5 days in a row I don't think it's necessary to do a sub taper. 

I also have those dark web ""2mg"" pressed Xanax / alprazolam bars which in reality have 3-4mg of alprazolam in them.
Along with advil aka ibuprofen. 
Also have some OTC supplements like inositol, multi, b complex, magnesium, fish oil & 4 caps of kava kava left. Oh and I have suntheanine caps with 50mg each. 
I also have some Trazadone , a few cllondone left from my last detox , buspar, mirtazapine, weed, pepto and ofc advil...

I know that because of it being a 4-5day / brief relapse after being several months cleean from a 3 year habit my wd won't be total hell like it has been before 

But it's not gonna be fun either.
Already feeling it. Had 2 beers which kinda helped but wanted to ask u guys in terms of the meds before  I taking them . Which ones you think are best? 
Mostly fatigue, restlessness, slight g.i.problems & bad anxiety I'm experiencing Probably sleep problems tonight when I gotta sleep. 

My question being ...
Out of all of these what would you take to deal with this kind of withdrawl???? 
All answers welcome. 
Thank you. 
Wish me luck.

Our primary middle for H got arrested for breaking into a facility via a ventilator shaft and had to turn himself in to authorities. 

A connect for blues came on to the scene at the same time so that was kind of helpful but needless to say money I would've spend on H had to go towards a smaller amount of blues. No mind, the blues can last longer and they did while I still had some left.

I was surprised that my friend didn't talk me into giving him my last blue which I was saving for a long work day yesterday. It got me through all eight+ hours and the bite of the cold only reared it's ugly chill later that evening when I went to visit a ""clean"" friend's house for blunts and movies.

&nbsp;

Now of course two days ago I helped my friend pick up his xanax script and he gave me one xanax pill. His plan was to save the rest so that he could sell or trade them to someone for H. Well, the beno addict didn't have money or H to trade but we all have likely heard of the brutality of benzo WD so naturally the dude was begging my friend to trade early without anything in exchange.

&nbsp;

I spend part of my work day trying to text my running partner with no response. Finally as I'm calling his house phone he responds to my texts and gives me a status update. Sometimes I know he just doesn't like delivering bad news, he's more likely to sugarcoat things. 

I once waited days through BS stories. He said someone would get him something that they owed him.. I sat in my house on my day off in anticipation only to get disappointment two hours after a text that said ""it's going down."" I think my friend gave up on responding to my frenzied self as he did months back but I wouldn't bother him if he simply said, ""it ain't going down.""

&nbsp;

This time I don't need him to tell me it isn't going down to know. I just wanted to get some benzos to knock me the fuck out. In all fairness my physical symptoms are quite mild. Sure, today was the first day of mud butt but I found lope so I took a double dose of that. Right now I'm forcing myself to eat before I take a shower and get some exercise. 

&nbsp;

It's in the high 50s outside but the bite of the cold nips hard. I plan to go out with layers that include thermal undergarments. I plan to be comfortable as I travel, and when I get to my good family raising friend's house for another movie night over blunts. 

&nbsp;

Aside from a loss of appetite and the bite of the cold I feel fortunate, I could feel far worse. Nonetheless, I wouldn't dare push any unusual strenuous activity or travel with any new or unfamiliar friends. 

Although I work tomorrow, I'm lucky it's a short shift. I should be able to bite the bullet despite the harshness of the cold.

&nbsp;

Regarding the post title. **What didn't work? My friend trading benzos for dope.** I called him yesterday and he was slurring like he took a large dose of xanax. I think he's been passed out for the past couple of days because of it. 

My friend's sibling called me saying the internet was out. I think my friend knocked out the connections in his benzo stupor and couldn't figure out how to reconnect everything.

&nbsp;

I told the sibling I'd take a look at it as soon as I showered. I should really stop fucking with opiates before winter kicks in. When I go to my friend's apartment it's a wreck but when there is dope or opiates it's easy to ignore. When my friend is in WD, as am I.. it smells worse, it looks worse....it's cold and stark and generally miserable.

I'm only going because I need to get out of the house. I don't expect my friend's sibling to throw me any perks. If anything maybe a smoke up. Now I gotta force myself to eat some chicken, strawberries then prepare to depart.",1509918067.0

Pretty much everything speaks for it not showing up, I'm young so I have a better liver than older people, I exercised 3 times that week and I drank loads of water two days after my last dose.

I'm 6 foot 2 and weigh about 280 lbs so I have quite a bit of fat on me.

I'm making it in a tea... yeah.. you know. I don't think I'm allowed to name it here.

Anyways, I'm currently working and I cannot take time off for another year. Basically, I'm a co-op student, no sick leave, I'll probably get fired if I take many days off, etc. There's no going around this. If I get fired now, I'll get kicked out of my uni program and so on. 

I've been through mild opium withdrawal and it lasted like a good 2-3 weeks. I know I'll be going through something a lot worse, work will be impossible. I need to do this in 5 days or less (christmas holiday). 

I have a lot of kratom on me. But I'm really contemplating switching to an opiate that has a shorter withdrawal, I dont really care if it's worse I just need it to be short. I've been through severe benzo withdrawal so I'm not too scared of how bad it'll be. I know it'll suck, but nothing I cant manage

Anyways I want to get H, but idk if this is a horrible idea even though I truly believe that I will only use it to switch from opium, then withdraw from that. Will that even work? What would you do in my situation? 

And no there's no way I can take time off, trust me, I've even spoken to my manager along with HR (Didnt say it was opiate withdrawal, just about mental health and she basically told me to suck it up or else I cant work here)

7bbw1m,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7bbw1m/open_letter_to_health_canada_re_otc_codeine_ban/,2,https://redd.it/7bbw1m,anonopiatecanada,Open Letter to Health Canada re: OTC Codeine Ban,"Health Canada is considering making current OTC formulations that contain codeine available by prescription only and asking for feedback by Nov 8. (https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/programs/consultation-non-prescription-low-dose-codeine.html). I wrote them the following letter. Please share and write your own letter if you are also concerned with harm reduction.

To whom it may concern:

I am writing to you to provide the prospective of a long-time opiate user who is first and foremost concerned with the principle of harm reduction and increased safety for those in our communities who physically dependent on opioids. It is my firm belief that ending the general availability of low-dose codeine formulations over-the-counter will, absolutely and without a doubt, lead to an increase in the consumption of illegally-obtained alternatives and a corresponding rise in accidental overdose deaths caused by the unpredictable potency of illegal narcotics and their frequent adulteration with dangerous and extremely potent compounds such as fentanyl. It will therefore have an impact entirely contrary to the stated goal of reducing both levels of opioid dependency and related overdose deaths in Canada.

OTC codeine formulations form an important part of the harm-reduction toolkit available to opiate-dependent individuals in Canada for several reasons.

1) It is well known that one of the principal ways in which patients develop a dependency on opiates is through legal prescriptions provided by a doctor. It is when these legal prescriptions come to an end that dependent individuals turn to other means to satisfy their needs. OTC codeine formulations provide an important safe and legal stopgap for those individuals seeking to alleviate withdrawal symptoms while gradually weaning themselves off opiates. In the absence of such a stopgap, former pain patients are far more likely to seek out illegal alternatives that do not come with the benefit of regulatory oversight guaranteeing their safety, both in terms of freedom from adulterants, as well as by providing a specific, measurable, and reliable dosage of the active ingredient.

2) Because of this regulatory oversight, as well as the biological ceiling for conversion of codeine to morphine in the liver, it is far less likely that users of codeine products will accidentally overdose or otherwise use these products in a life-threatening manner. While there is a potential for harm arising from these formulations' other ingredients (APAP or ASA), most users mitigate this risk through the process of cold-water extraction of the codeine, which removes the vast majority of the potentially harmful ingredients. While this is clearly a misuse of the product and not something the medical establishment can or should recommend, it is nonetheless far safer in practice than turning to street drugs such as heroin, or even to illegally diverted pharmaceuticals, which may themselves be counterfeit and adulterated with other substances.

3) The general availability of OTC codeine products forms an important safety net even for regular users of far more powerful narcotics or illegal street drugs such as heroin. While codeine will not completely relieve the withdrawal symptoms of a heavy user, it can provide enough symptomatic relief at a relatively low cost to keep addicts from being driven to risky behaviour when they find their regular supply chains interrupted or can no longer afford their habits. Such risky behaviour includes both seeking out new sources for drugs from untrusted sources (which presents potential dangers both in the possibility of acquiring contaminated or adulterated products and the inherent danger of seeking out drugs on the street) and the possibility that the desperation of severe withdrawal may encourage users to engage in criminal activity to relieve their symptoms.

Lastly, and admittedly anecdotally, I personally saw the value in the availability of OTC codeine several years ago when the government cracked down on the availability of dode (dried poppy pods). Faced with the option of turning from their previous dependency on a relatively easily and safely obtained source of opiates like dried poppy pods (widely available online and even in flower shops) to a far more dangerous alternative like heroin, many users, myself included, opted instead for the safety and legality of OTC codeine. Without that option, I am certain that many if not most of these users would have begun using heroin instead, even with all the dangers it presents.

While the government and Health Canada obviously cannot be seen to endorse or condone the sort of misuse of OTC codeine products I have described here, and we would of course all prefer a situation in which every opiate-dependent person were both willing and able to tackle their addiction through the existing medical system in consultation with a doctor, I think we are all aware that many opiate users do not see this an option for a variety of reasons. Eliminating this relatively safe and legal alternative for them will inevitably lead to more use of heroin, fentanyl, and other illegal narcotics, and a consequent rise in accidental overdose deaths. From the standpoint of harm reduction, restricting the availability of these products is a serious mistake, and will certainly cost lives.

Thank you for your attention, and hopefully also for your compassion.

Yours truly,

Anonymous opiate user

7bbvss,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7bbvss/trams_addict/,41,https://redd.it/7bbvss,queencatlady09,Trams addict,"This is my first week here on Reddit and I've made a few posts and comments, but I definitely enjoy this sub and so I decided to share something a bit more personal. 
Just like most opiate addicts I started out with pills from my doctor. I have a stomach condition that does cause pain sometimes and over the past 4 years I've been given various things for pain. The occasional scripts for oxy, MS Contin and fent patches were always easy to just enjoy the script and then quit when gone. 
The Tramadol was a different story. Taking it every day for my stomach pain maintenance (and yes I did enjoy the feeling) has now become an addiction of 4 years I can't escape. The few times I've tried to quit either by weaning myself down or cold turkey were so awful that it's hard to imagine I will ever be able to do it. The only success I've had is that last year I was able to cut my dose from 500mg a day down to 150mg a day and haven't faltered from that.
Unfortunately trying to take any less than 150mg a day causes me to start feeling sick. I've never had a problem buying some oxy to enjoy for a couple nights and then stopping.....but with tramadol it's not about getting high it's about a physical dependence. I know trams may seem like child's play to a lot of you, but I promise the wd's are every bit as awful.
While reading a lot of posts here I've started to wonder if maybe subs might be an option for me. I don't want to trade one addiction for another, but I haven't had a problem being able to get off other opiates and so maybe it's something to consider.

The scars on my neck belong to her. Two cigarette burns, perfectly round and white, sit two inches below my ears where Frankenstein‚Äôs creature had his bolts. I see them every time I shave, and they remind me of hard days with my girl.  Her name was Danielle, but I called her baby.
------------
In the middle of our arguments we screamed in one another‚Äôs faces. Sometimes, I cleared my throat and hawked phlegm into her eyes, and she spat back into mine. We tried to blow each other away with the spray of verbal buckshot until there was nothing left of us. Ten minutes later we made love on the bed or the back seat of the Camry and found something or someone to rob. It was a game we played, and it was killing both of us.
--------------
The first time I met her, her boyfriend lay on the floor of my apartment trembling and bleeding through his pants.  My drug dealers pulled him out of her Camry on the south side of town and stabbed him in the knee for trying to go around me and deal with them directly.  It didn‚Äôt work out for him, thus the crying and bleeding on my floor.

‚ÄúHi.‚Äù

‚ÄúHi.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you Riley?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.  You must be Danielle.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure am.‚Äù  She dropped his head to put her hand out.

‚ÄúGood to finally meet you.‚Äù  I smiled and pinched her fingers.


I was seeing a different girl at the time, a 19-year-old red head who liked to smoke her dope and tell me she was on her way over hours before she left her house, but that morning in my apartment, the look in Danielle‚Äôs eye told me it was only a matter of time before we got together.  Never mind Mike and the red head.

Danielle and Mike used to come over every day before three to laugh at me for nodding out and looking like Teen Wolf.  She always tried to get alone with me, but we didn‚Äôt hook up until after Mike started beating her again and I spent two weeks locked up, promising myself and everyone else that I would never do heroin again.

Mike took the battery out of her car and held her against her will in a trailer on the Mesa while I sat in jail.  Then he passed out one afternoon after he put the battery back in, and she made her escape.  Half an hour later, I called her from the payphone outside of the jail, and our reign of terror began.

I should tell you that this is the part of the story where you might want to stop reading.  On the next page or so, I‚Äôm going to sell a guy a bag of dirt for 40 dollars and turn his face into hamburger meat before I hold him hostage in his bedroom for the night.  My girlfriend will beg me to infect her with the Hepatitis C virus, and I will try.  A few pages after that, I will rob a dead man, so if you‚Äôre not with all that or don‚Äôt understand that we were in a bad way, this is a good time to stop reading.

One of the only three heroin dealers in town fronted us packages of dope, and we came back with the money every night.  He fronted us more, and we returned with more cash.  Then he gave us a half-ounce, but we never came back.  He offered anyone in town a 50-dollar bag for our whereabouts and left promises to murder me on her voicemail.  We ripped off other junkies.  They hated us.  We stole merchandise and food from businesses.  The owners and employees hated us.  Several cops in town knew that I was driving the Camry and that I had a girlfriend.  They hated us too, but we hated each other most of all.

Danielle had a monthly prescription for 90 Colonopin and a SSI check.  Both were available on the first of the month, and we shot so much dope and took so many pills the first week of the month that our only friend quit hanging out with us.  When her orange pill bottle quit rattling and the check was spent, anxiety wrought havoc.  More than once she left me at the gas station and freezing at three in the morning while I was buying cigarettes and drove by a few times, screaming and giving me the finger for no reason.  Later in the night we would go to the ER looking for meds.

Her Camry became our home.  We cleaned out the ashtray at the casino several times a day and listened to Depeche Mode and Seminole Wind by John Anderson.  Our diet consisted entirely of Wendy‚Äôs spicy chicken nuggets and Baja Blast.  She made me give her a shot of dope visibly mixed with my own blood to intentionally contract Hepatitis C.  That way I could no longer use contamination as an excuse for why I wouldn‚Äôt share a hit or a rinse with her.  One afternoon I pulled over on the side of the highway and proposed to her with her own wooden ring.  She said yes and we made out like two outlaws in love.

A lot of guys liked her.  One of them lived in a nice apartment his parents paid for.  His name was Justin.  Now I forget what he said, but it made me mad.  Then he gave us 40 bucks to go score, so she and I split it between us and put dirt in his bag.  He called to complain, but we quit answering the phone.  Later that night, I decided we should sleep at his place, so I parked in his parking lot and told her,

‚ÄúGet all of our blankets and meet me at the front door, baby.‚Äù

As I walked through the cobblestone courtyard of the adobe apartment complex, I wondered how mad he was and thought of what I was about to do.  I fingered the baggie in my pocket.  At his front door breath billowed out of my mouth, and the raps of my knuckles on his door bit cold into my bones.  I put my hand back into my pocket and waited.  The television played on the other side of the door.  He opened it, but the chain only allowed a few inches.

‚ÄúWho is that?  Riley?  What do you want?  I ought to mess you up for selling me dirt!  Get out of here!‚Äù The interior light of his apartment poured out yellow through the crack in the door.  It looked warm and comfortable.

‚ÄúI know.  I know.  Listen.  I got something here, to make up for it.‚Äù  I moved my arm and hand in my pocket, to indicate it was in my pocket.  ‚ÄúOpen up, so I can show you.‚Äù

‚ÄúOk.‚Äù  The door closed momentarily while the chain latch came off.  The knob turned.  I grabbed it and lodged myself in the doorframe so he couldn‚Äôt close it.  ‚ÄúWhat are you doing?  You can‚Äôt stay here!  Why does she have blankets?  Dude, what the f***?  Seriously?‚Äù  A pile of blankets with Danielle‚Äôs legs bounced through the courtyard towards us.  I made sure she got in before I let him shut the door.

She threw the blankets on the shag rug in front of his TV.  He whined in the kitchen and flapped his arms, but we disregarded him until we had settled in and felt ready to address him.  His accusations were mostly accurate, except when he said we didn‚Äôt have any heroin.  We did, but not for him.

After she and I situated things, I showed him the 20-dollar bag we had.  It was enough to shut him up, because we promised to share.  We told him we would split it three ways, but in the bathroom, she and I split it down the middle.  Afterwards, we rinsed the spoon and cotton filter a few more times, until all that was left was dirt and ash in the spoon.  Then we sucked it up and came out of the bathroom to give it to him.  He happily took the syringe full of dirty water and never accused us of anything until we hid ourselves in the bathroom again.

Danielle had her pants down, and I sat on the toilet applying cortisone cream to a patch of eczema on her rear end and thigh.  She leaned over the sink.  The door was locked while I took care of my baby.

‚ÄúOpen up.  I know you‚Äôre in there doing more!  Open up!  You pieces of s***!‚Äù  The door shook as he pounded.  ‚ÄúOpen up!  Open the f***ing door!‚Äù  The door hit her in the head when he kicked it in.


My hands ripped the cedar towel rack out of the wall, before I could think.  I beat him back out of the bathroom and side-to-side, across the living room with the wooden rod.  A symphony of rage blared out of me and into my opponent.  High notes of great satisfaction created melodies of glee as I continued to dominate.  I was the impassioned composer of a brutal work, wildly conducting an orchestra of fingers, fists and arms.  He tripped and fell backwards over his coffee table and couch.

My shirt was off and sweat was dripping when I threw the rod at his face.  He could have it, because I owned him now.  I leapt onto his chest for the crescendo of my opus and went to work.  I pinned his arms under my legs.  Bare knuckles bloodied themselves on his cheeks, and his face turned side to side with each punch.  Snot and blood leaked from his mouth and nose, and he squealed as I stopped to catch my breath.

‚ÄúPlease, stop! Please! Please!‚Äù My teeth bit into my bottom lip.  I looked at him for a second with my fist cocked back, before I tried to drive it through the back of his skull.  His face was swollen and discolored and bloody.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what you get for messing with my girl.‚Äù  I thought and jumped up to grab the biggest butcher knife in the kitchen.  About 10 inches of blade shined in the living room light.

‚ÄúI will f***ing kill you!  You piece of s***!  I will f***ing gut you!  You f***ing hear me?‚Äù  The F word constituted about one of every ten of my words back then!  ‚ÄúGet in your room and give me your cell phone!  You can come out in the morning, when she and I are done.  You hear me, you f***ing piece of s***?  Come out of the room, and I will stick this f***ing knife in your throat!  Your guts will be all over this f***ing floor!  You f***ing hear me?‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt say anything.  He gave me his phone and held his face as he walked into his room.  People around town always told me that he was a fighter.  Supposedly he stood up to Diablo once and even ‚Äúgave him a run for his money.‚Äù  Everyone always said he was tough, but not that night.

Danielle and I made a bed on the floor out of our blankets.  She pulled up some pornography on his phone.  Whatever meth we did the day before was too strong and the heroin was too weak to get us to sleep, so we had sex on and off throughout the night.  Sometimes, I smoked cigarettes and tried to write poetry on pieces of cardboard box.  She played dress up with some clothes that she had brought in.  Later in the night she said something that hurt my feelings, so I used the scissors in my hand to stab myself in the leg a few times, but as daylight broke there was forgiveness and more sex.  We defiled his toothbrush before we left, but I can‚Äôt remember why.

For 10 years I was a daily user and then also a daily user of meth. My use sent me all the way to the other side of the Continent trying to find peace. I went to rehab in Georgia 2.5 years ago to escape a life that I was getting nowhere way too fast. I stayed clean of opiates for almost 2 years and was in a relationship with a girl for the longest I have ever been 8 months. After this relationship I dabnled in oxy a couple times and to my.utter dismay found that I had a tolerance of 40mg intranasal to even start to feel it's effects this was horrible to me I thought I would get high off of one 30mg oxy but no even after almost 2 years of touching no opiates Dilaudid found it's way back into my life and I used it for 2 months crashed burned and left the east back to the Midwest. Here I found a thing they call tea and dabbled in it finding to my astonishment I had to take what people considered gigantic doses to feel good. This was disheartening at best. I want peace but find none in sobriety and also find less in use. I am thinking about trying methadone for I have only done it a couple days before I am scared though that I will be stuck with that forever even if I do it for only a short period I am scared of the 30 day withdrawal I might have to experience from it if I go that route. I am horrified that have a base tolerance that is worse than some active users I know. I don't even know how that works. I recently was sent some ok quality h and enjoyed it for a couple of days this isn't first day without it but I have Suboxone but I still feel empty. I woke up in the middle of the night after grueling work at a manufacturing plant and my muscles where sore and I hurt so I did my h. It didn't really work very well and left me with really bad histamine reaction where u rubbed some of the skin off my face I seem to get this reaction to all good opiates it's terrible the things I love cause such bad hystamine reaction that I rub skin off my face. I guess I want to ask are there others out there that have experienced this evil baseline tolerance? Is there ever peace? What have you done? ,1510032967.0

I start IOP tomorrow, so that's gonna be it starting tomorrow. I was thinking of boiling down that tutor to get the rest off then insufflating it.

This IOP is supposed to be like 8 weeks. But damn, I really want to score some fire tar from the DNM for after that 8 weeks is up. I'm sure y'all know what it's like.

From the time that I got out until now, I've only used h a handful of times. The last time was a month ago where I ended up at the hospital from a near fatal overdose. I had fallen out hours before someone found me, I was blue, and the EMT's narcanned me and had to intubate me in the field. I was given a 10% chance of survival when admitted to the hospital and was in a coma for four days. For some reason, I made a full recovery without any brain damage that is noticeable to me. Anyways, I started IV'ing heroin 3 years ago with the first year and half being daily usage and this last year and a half is intermittent use. Before I started doing h, I waited tables at a busy breakfast joint. I was on my feet for 8-9 hours a day without any break because most of the time we were on a wait at the restaurant. Looking back now, I have no idea how I had the capacity to muster up that much energy. I don't think I'd be able to do that job now, even though I'm clean. I also have hep c (for the second time) which I think contributes to my lack of energy, along with my persistent depression. Does anyone else find that even after being clean from heroin you struggle to find the energy to even do simply daily activities. Things like making dinner for myself or even going to work where I sit at a desk all day are grueling tasks for me. When I used to withdrawal from dope, the biggest struggle for me wasn't the physical pain I was in, but rather that everything was just HARD. Everyday almost feels like I'm withdrawing. I just don't know if this fatigue is from the hep c, depression, or years of using heroin. I would guess it's a combination of all three. ",1510012309.0

**How do you stay safe when using?** I see a bunch of resources on this sub (fentanyl warnings, narcan/needle exchange locators, info to identify presses, etc.) but I'm wondering what people actually do on a day-to-day basis to stay safe. Do you pay close attention to the fentanyl warnings? Do you have Narcan ready to go? Do you do testing yourself (can regular people even do that?). Only use with friends? What else?

I am dabbling in the idea of creating a stamp report website as an obvious tool for harm reduction but am aware that certain places already exist such as r/glassine and DAU. When I was using I frequently visited opiophile to get information on stamps if I could. I wanted a life after my addiction. The reason I am posting this is to mainly find out what you guys think is missing from existing places to report stamps and what I could do differently to make it better for those in active addiction.

Right now my plan is to make it simplistic as possible and just as easy to use on mobile as on desktop. I would create a main directory of area codes and inside each area code you would post stamp reports. Comments could be made on stamp reports in order to strengthen the consensus on a particular stamp. I was also thinking of making it mandatory for the OP of a stamp report to include their tolerance because I feel this plays an important role when dealing with potency. Fentanyl reports would be stickied to the top of each area code. Still deciding whether the option for image upload is necessary. I know some stamps just have symbols/logos. Although I would require an email and password to sign up for using the website, when posting and commenting you would only be displayed as a number that is assigned to your account when you create it. First person to signup would be #1 and so on. I feel this is the best route to go to keep anonymity a priority. Outside of that I'm open to suggestions as I just started toying with this idea 24 hours ago.

Finally, I know some users will use this information to seek out hot bags which could cause them not to exist as a person anymore. My view on this is that I think it is more important for the user to know what they are getting than to just use bags blindly without knowing anything. I hope most of you will agree with me on this.

I‚Äôve been using opiates for roughly 16YRS. For the most part I‚Äôd say the first 14YRS I was a weekend user. I have a network of friends and family that know I like them and would call me anytime they were available. 2YRS ago things changed...the woman I love who had been by my side for 20YRS got tired of my bullshit, got strong, and decided she was done, this was devastating and no antidepressant could cure the emotional pain...but Norcos and Oxys could. I‚Äôm now fucked and can‚Äôt go a day without them and sourcing is getting harder and harder, not to mention the cost associated with my addiction.

I have a good job, kids, a house in a good area and I am risking too much continuing with this fucking habit. Question to my favorite sub is...If I turn myself in to a Suboxone doctor am I flagged for life as a opiate abuser? There‚Äôs other legit meds I take that I use that I cannot live without. Can someone explain it to me like I‚Äôm 5YRS old what the process is like if I opt to do this and see a Suboxone specialist? Will this information be shared with my primary doctor? 


UPDATE 1: Made an appointment for today. Will keep you all posted after my visit.

UPDATE 2: Saw the Sub Doctor. Cash only $177 for initial visit. Told him how I started with opiates and how I progressively graduated to harder shit. He prescribed 60 8MG Suboxone Films I told him my insurance would most likely not cover name brand so he also wrote one for 60 8MG generic pills-only one could be filled. He was going to give me my first dose in the office and even stated he could see that I was already seating and hours away from withdrawals but he realized he ran out of the Sub Films. His nurse who was super sweet suggested I rush to CVS to fill my RX and was confident I would have no issues in finding them or get any issues from any pharmacist...but that was not the case. I went to my local CVS who had my information and they didn‚Äôt have them, they also would not honor the cost I found on GoodRX or the coupon for the name brand I found directly from the Suboxone website AND they would not search to see if there were any local CVS that had any in stock. So I went to Walgreens, dude who saw me was totally eye fucking me the whole time and you could tell he was on alert, he stated he could not find my insurance and when he tried to call my insurance they were closed, he would not tell me if they had it in stock, I left visibly pissed for the waste of time. I then went to my local Albertsons, this will go down as the worst customer experience I‚Äôve ever had EVER. Older pharmacist lady took a look at both scripts and fucking rolled her eyes, I shit you not ROLLED the mutherfuckers. I politely relayed to her that I would take the cheaper of the two and per GoodRX they had the best cash price if I opted to go that route. She took both scripts, my insurance card, and the coupon for 15 minutes all the while mumbling some shit under her breath. She came back and said she couldn‚Äôt find my insurance, told her forget the insurance I‚Äôll pay cash with the GoodRX coupon. She paused and then said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not comfortable filling that for you, you should go to a pharmacy that already has your information.‚Äù Now I‚Äôm pissed cause now I know she never intended to fill it even if she found my insurance. I sternly but composed told her that this could potentially save my life and I understand she is uncomfortable but I have a medical need for it. She shot me down and reiterated she did not have it in stock and would not order it. I left before anything escalated. I left a message for the doctor requesting he provide me with a list of Sub friendly pharmacies that will not judge or profile me. I‚Äôll update once he responds but i hade to place an order with my plug to get me thru these next couple days.

I hate myself for not fully trusting my SO.

My SO is a recovering opiate (mainly oxy) addict. He's been prescribed subutex for 4 years now and when we began dating a few months ago, decided he would taper off and quit. It has not been going well to say the least. We both agree it is in his best interest to get back on it. However, he claims that because he has not been to his doctor in a few months to refill his prescription, his doctor will see that he's clean and not refill it. My SO believes then that he must pee dirty, and be drug tested by his doctor in order to get his prescription back. Therefore he's been asking everyone he knows for some oxy which is beginning to worry me. He tells me he'll only take one just to get his prescription back. I've been pleading with him to see his doctor anyway, just simply explaining all the trouble he's having and how he wants back on the subs but he says from experience this doesn't work? 

So does anyone else have experience with this? Will he truly need to show his doctor he's relapsed to get back on it?

And just to state, I totally do not judge anyone for using opiates or anything else for that matter. It has just been hard for me to witness him struggle with his cravings, seeking out any drugs he can, and abuse his other prescription meds. He has not been able to locate any Oxy for weeks, not knowing I actually have an old prescription for a past surgery.

Like in the movies where you see those portrayals, often exaggerated, of people jerking straight up in bed, drenched in sweat, gasping from a nightmare - it‚Äôs exactly that. 

Once it was wolves chasing me, another time it was being stuck in a car being run off train tracks into a bottomless pit. Last night was I had to make choices about saving my family members from different fears while trying to outrace a bomb strapped to my chest that can be triggered by fear. It was ridiculous... but scared the shit out of me because I also relived my brother‚Äôs death.

My habit got way way out of control but I had a boyfriend who was trying to help me get well. I tried kicking cold turkey on my couch. I tried kicking with subs on my couch. When neither of those things worked I, reluctantly, went to detox then rehab. I left rehab after 7 days. I told myself I was miserable because I couldn't sleep there. I told myself I had to leave because I wasn't allowed to shave and the food was gross. In reality, I just wanted to come home so I could get high. That's exactly what I did too. Not 2 hours after getting off the plane I was sitting in my car, in a parking lot, shooting dope. 




I beat myself up about it afterward. I'm a piece of shit. Why can't I just stay clean? Why did I leave rehab? Why can't I do the right thing for my boyfriend and my family? Why am I constantly setting my heaping dumpster of a life on fire?




Last night, I was confronted by my mom and aunt. They both said all the right things. They set boundaries, with love. They told me they're here for me and want me to get well. I told them I want to get well too and I fucking *meant* it. 




I felt great about today. It was a new start. I called my boyfriend to see when he wanted me to come over. He said he didn't. He loves me but thinks we should give each other space and time so that I can show him I'm taking the steps to get well. This upset me. I wanted him to hug and kiss me. I'm a selfish person, after all, and the only thing I care about is what I want, not what I or anyone else *needs*. As a creature of habit, instead of dealing with my hurt feelings, I used that as an excuse to get high. 




As soon as the dope left the syringe I felt a rush...but not the one I had wanted. Instead, I was bombarded with all of those questions again. The feeling of hopelessness and helplessness filled my heart and I just wanted to die. 




Not long after my shot I hear a timid tapping at my front door. ""It's me,"" said my boyfriend in a voice as hesitant as his knock. I froze. ""Fuck,"" I thought. I didn't want him to see me high; he'd know right away as usual. I opened the door, staring hard at the ground. As soon as he was inside and the door closed I told him. ""I didn't think I'd see you today. I'm high."" He deflated. I started my usual deluge of apologies. 




Somehow, he forgave me. Somehow, he found the strength to kiss and hug me instead of choking me. It was going to be ok. I told myself that I'd finally get clean and tomorrow would be the start of a new me. I'd told myself this countless times and this time I believed it, as I always have. 




My boyfriend and I decided it was time for bed. It felt so good to be held by him. We talked about our day, our future, all the things happy couples whisper to each other in bed late at night. Without thinking, I said, ""I emailed /u/OpiLobster in jail. He has 40 days clean. Maybe we can be a good influence on each other."" The moment of silence after I said that hung heavy in the air and I knew right away, I'd fucked up. 




I could feel my boyfriend's angry glare through the darkness. He started shouting, **""And you'll keep in touch with him when he gets out too! How can you stay sober hanging out with a junkie!""** I calmly asked him to stop yelling at me. I calmly said he was jumping to conclusions. He responds, **""I've been right about everything else you've done that was fucked up. I'll be right about this too!""** Passive agressiveness is my greatest defense so I mumbled, ""Yeah..you're always right because I'm just a stupid junkie right?"" When he responded with more yelling, I got up and left the room. My second greatest defense is to run. In fairness, I'm not one to just sit and let someone yell at me. My self esteem may be in the gutter but even I know I don't deserve that.




A few moments of silence pass. My boyfriend fuming in the bedroom. Me, nervously flipping through channels in the living room. I hear the bedroom door open and my heart starts to race. He's fully dressed and grabbing his keys. He says he's leaving. He says he doesn't need this shit. I shake my head and tell him that leaving is probably a good idea. He slams my front door and in the hallway I hear him clear his throat and spit. I open the door and there is a slimy ooze of loogie dripping down the door. I look at him as he's stomping down the stairs and ask the obvious. ""Did you just sit on my door?"" ""Yes,"" he says, ""because you're a piece of shit."" I stand there watching him leave. My heart is racing and my face becomes wet with tears but I don't actually feel any of it. I'm 10 feet in the air, looking down at this circus in disbelief. I hear him screaming in the courtyard, ""A junkie bitch lives here! A heroin addict whore! Everyone, a heroin addict lives here!.."" The calls become more and more faint as he makes his way to the parking lot. I'm still standing in my doorway, feet cemented to the floor. I'm still watching from high above. This isn't happening. This isn't *happening*.




But it is. It did happen. 




I received one last text from him telling me he's blocking me. I thought I was going to marry this man one day. Once I got clean we would have a beautiful, healthy life together. Now all I have is spit on my door and a mob of angry neighbors. 




At least the heat radiating from the dumpster fire that is my life will keep me warm at night. That will have to be enough for me. For now.

Haven't had somas in a couple years and only take them sporadically. Remember hearing they are great with norcs or oxy back in the days, but never got around to the combo. With just soma alone, I have taken as much as 5x350mg at once and got the soma shuffle and really enjoyed the phade for a couple hours before fading away. It was definitely hard to walk and got a little clumsy, but it was fun and had a friend watching me to make sure don't accidently kill myself lol. Not gonna shoot any bth today and haven't already, just going to be taking dabs with it. Just popped 2x350mg somas. Is this sufficient to get the full euphoric synergy effect or should I take 1 or 2 more. Soma tolerance builds so quickly, so even if I dose tomorrow, will not be as strong as it was today, but still don't want to OD because they are both CNS depressants.

She typically charges 20% of whatever I buy so she can keep it for herself. This I don't have a problem with at all. The issue comes as for at least the last 6 months she has been asking me to find her stuff. I know 3 people who get monthly scripts and I let her know when something comes available. She doesn't drive so wether she is middling for me or I for her I have to do all the driving. At least half the time that she asks me to help her get something she asks me to pay for it, promising to pay me back when I drop it off to her. Half the time she doesn't have the money and pushes the payment back. She is currently 10 days late paying me back for a couple subs I got her. I will be able to get ahold of some oxy tomorrow 15mg 5 for $60 and I told her that I wanted her to start giving me the same she expects me to give her when she middles. She threw an absolute fit telling me I was being unfair. I explained to her that I am willing to compromise but I won't be taken advantage of. She bitched me out telling me she didn't want them and hasn't messaged me back since. Am I wrong for expecting the same from her that she expects from me? What would you have done in the same situation?

TL:DR Friend middles for me occasionally & expects rides and at least a 20% share, but when I middle for her she refuses to do the same for me and got furious when I asked for the same kind of treatment. What to do? Better way to explain my point?

EDIT: Thank you all for your responses/advice, and support. I really appreciate it.  We have been friends for 10 years and only the last couple have we been helping each other out with our connects and thus a build up of these kinds of problems. I.E. her taking advantage of me because I am too nice. I may try to talk to her one more time and see if she will come around. If not I am going to tell her not to ask me to hook her up when she is dry and I will not go to her when my people are out. If she can't handle that then we won't be friends anymore.",1510126872.0

A Mexican that delivers dope for the cartel to users and street dealer.","So in my state (which borders Mexico), I've heard the term twice now being used by middles. They call them ""pisas."" I don't know if I am spelling it correctly, but these guys are runners brought in from Mexico. They are not members of the cartel but they are associates. Their job is to drive around all day and deliver tar. It isn't even necessarily large quantities that you have to order. Basically the cartels control the supply chain for tar from the source all the way down to just above street level, so they don't get caught by police as often as they would by street dealing.

It just annoys me because I know these pisas will deliver straight to your home if you want, or a nearby parking lot, whatever you want. But with my middles, I have to call them, they calls the pisas, they deliver to wherever is convenient for the middles. The middle gets in their car, does the deal, and bring me back my tar. 

I know damn well that the middles are charging a pretty significant convenience fee. But it isn't a convenience. I have to drive pretty far to meet my middle. It would be a hell of a lot better if I could contact the pisa myself. I'd delivery with better prices. But no way in hell the middle is going to vet me and connect me with them. They basically fund their habit with this setup. 

I originally thought the pisas only dealt with vetted street dealers, but one middle had the audacity to just get in my car with his buddy and ask me to drop the guy off at home. And I overheard him talking, and I asked some questions and he was like ""the pisas are great, they stick to their rules too, they deliver in the order in which the calls come in, you cannot call back and say 'I'm sick, I need it now' to try and get your delivery bumped up"" This made me realize they aren't just delivering to street dealers, they are normal everyday customers.

Has anyone been in this type of procedure for buying? Were you ever to get in with the pisas directly? If so, how? I'm sick of all the driving to wherever is convenient for my middle. Also I know the middles are jacking the price way up, because as soon as I get a new plug, they start dropping their prices to get you back.",1510125426.0

----


There was once a curious pebble who lived at the top of a tall oak tree in a sprawling valley. He spent most of his life sitting restlessly on a friendly green leaf. He spent his time basking in the sun, and swaying in the cool breeze.

One day, the curious pebble thought he needed something more. So, he rolled himself to another comfortable spot on the leaf, where he was sure he'd be much happier.

In his new spot, the pebble received a little more light from the sun and even had a better view of the valley. The pebble was quite content, indeed. 

But, after a while, he grew accustomed to this new spot and desired even more. So, he moved, once again.

The pebble continued to roll and roll as he approached the edge of the friendly leaf. By now, he wanted to turn back, but was unable to stop himself. The pebble fell off into the unknown.

After plummeting towards the distant and unfamiliar ground, the pebble found himself buried in the cold dirt.

The once curious pebble sulked in the darkness, yearning to return to where he once was. However, the pebble confused the darkness with shade, and decided to stay.

The confused pebble continued to sink deeper and deeper into the depths of the dirt.  

Eventually, the darkness grew insidious and heavy, and the pebble sank faster. There was nothing he could do to stop it. The pebble was now desperate to be free. 

Then one day it began to rain. Already miserable enough, the defeated pebble shunned away the fresh water that had fallen from above. The pebble knew nothing else, and grew ever accustomed to the the very darkness that imprisoned him.

Time passed, more slowly than usual, and the sad pebble began to wither. The pebble was trapped, and could not find a single reason why. The pebble had believed he was a strong little rock, after all.



.    .    .



Then one day, as the scorching sun baked the dirt surrounding the pebble to a near unbearable level, something miraculous happened.

A lone cloud slowly drifted through the clear blue sky and parked itself high above the demoralized pebble, above the tall oak tree, and above the sprawling valley. 

The quiet cloud softly rained down upon the dirt. 

Back beneath the ground, the water seeped down towards the pebble once more. And this time, the pebble was too tired, too broken, and too weak to fight it. The pebble knew death was imminent.

The water slowly slithered in, finding it's way into the broken pebble's cracks. The pebble could do nothing but yield to the strange and foreign intruder.

So close to death, the pebble couldn't help but think of what he once had, and what he once loved. He missed his comfy leaf, his strong tree, the cool wind and the bright sun. He wondered why he was never grateful for them before. He closed his eyes as a pebble for the last time.



.    .    .



When his eyes opened again, he was puzzled to see the oak tree that had once lovingly supported him towering tall above. He was surprised to feel the familiar cool breeze comfortably hug him. He also felt the warmth of the beautiful sun that had once given him a reason to live. 

He was grateful to be out of the dirt, but wasn't quite yet sure how it had happened.

It wasn't until the growing pebble looked up, and began reaching for the sun, that he realized he had not been a pebble, but a seed, all along...",1510120195.0

1. How long with the physical symptoms last? 5-6 days? Wanna be 80-90% for the cruise. Some good drinks and good fun.

2. IF I brought along a single dose, literally only bring enough for one time. If I used said dose one morning, say Tuesday or Thursday, love waiting up super early and relaxing, or on the beach with a nice glow). So if after taking nothing for 7-8-9 days, if I take a single 100mg dose, will it reset my withdrawal? Back to square one? Any downside. It would only be one dose, cause that's all I will bring. 

Any downside? That's all I'm worried about. Don't want withdrawals on the cruise and islands. Would like to enjoy a dose on the cruise one day and chill. But if its no bueno, I'll abstain.

Thoughts? All advice welcome. Never know how long to wait for the physical withdrawals to be over.

Will answer any questions.

Thanks people! Someone drop some knowledge on me. These are good problems to have I know. Worst case is I'll get a two week tolerance break. Best I'll get is one nice dose on the trip.

firstly, this chat is not affiliated with this subreddit or its moderators, and has its own moderators, rules, and etiquette. if you feel someone there has slighted you take it up with the moderators of tinychat, as it is completely unaffiliated with and not endorsed by this or any other subreddit.  

just a reminder and an announcement that a bunch of your fellow degenerate junkies, chippers, and tourists hang out in [our very own tinychat room](http://tinychat.com/ropiatesubchat) which has been an ongoing tradition for something like four years now. the location, for those who can't do links for whatever reason, is http://tinychat.com/ropiatesubchat. tinychat is an extremely buggy videochat client, but also the only one that fills its particular niche---that being, anyone who knows the room name may enter, and it has a youtube player. any technical difficulties may be addressed by the moderator, namely me. we like to hang out, listen to music, talk about random shit, and lately have even had our own resident sketch artist who draws random crap upon request. the primary purposes for the room's existence are companionship and harm reduction---it's nice to be able to shoot up with others around, even if you are technically alone in the non-digital sense, and have people keeping an eye on you. we're also glad to help with any problems you might be having, or questions you might need answered. we aim to be a welcoming, friendly space for the members of this subreddit to do what we do in good company without judgement. so stop by if you are bored, or just need to talk.  

if it appears like there is a moderator in the room but who is not speaking, just type a few sentences to summon them back.  *if you are on mobile it is not immediately apparent that there is anyone in the room. either click the button shaped like an outline of a person (i think) to see the list, or say hello to see if anyone responds.*

rules:

1. pick a unique username. this is to protect other users so we know who is who, given the nature of the sort of activities we enjoy.  

2. no lurking. again, to protect the other users. if you come in the room be prepared to introduce yourself and participate for at least a few minutes so we know you're not up to any shenanigans. if you are lurking you will be warned and then given a generous ten minutes to announce yourself. if the time runs out, you will be kicked (not banned) until you are ready to come in and actually participate. if you are a known member whose identity can be confirmed, this rule is irrelevant.  

3. no -isms or hate speech, even accidental. one warning will be issued, any continued insistence on such behavior will result in a ban. bans can be contested by pm'ing a moderator (me). this includes but is not limited to racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia. for example, if you are not black, use of the n-word, even with the -a ending, will not be tolerated. i don't care if your friend down the block lets you say it, it's not your lane.  

4. no auditory fuckery. due to peculiarities of the transmission of sound over a chat, certain echos and effects can be amplified to the point of being severely distressing. if it is determined that your end is causing an echo you will be asked to use headphones, or to mute your microphone when not speaking. deliberately making strange or unpleasant noises to annoy other chatters will not be tolerated, and your broadcast will be closed. (this only means that your video/audio feed will be terminated--you will still be allowed to type.)

i know the rules seem like a lot but there's really only four of them, and only two that pertain to just behaving in a manner that isn't dickish. thanks, and hope to see you there! **don't use alone.**",1510111491.0

Here's what that looks like broken down day by day... and here are some questions I have.","I believe the half life of buprenorphine is something like 36 hours. This means half of it is gone after 36 hours. This means if you re-dose after 24 hours, most of the previous dose is still there. This means that if you keep taking the same amount every 24 hours, it's going to keep building up. But, I have heard it said that there is a ""ceiling effect"" to how much can build up. I thought this was due to a biological mechanism, but after crunching the numbers I see now that actually it's just math.

Check this out. 24 divided by 36 is .66667 (two-thirds). So after 24 hours, you have metabolized two-thirds of one-half of the previous dose. In other words, .6667 * .5 = .3333 or one-third of the previous dose has been metabolized after 24 hours, meaning there is .6666 of the previous dose left in your system.

So let's say you're taking a small dose of 2mg every day. Here's what that build up is gonna look like the first 2 weeks:

Day 1: 2mg

Day 2: 2mg + .666*2mg = 3.333mg

Day 3: 2mg + .666*3.333mg = 4.222mg

Day 4: 2mg + .666*4.222mg = 4.814814mg

Day 5: 2mg + .666*4.814mg = 5.2099mg

Day 6: 2mg + .666*5.2099mg = 5.473mg

Day 7: 2mg + .666*5.473mg = 5.649mg

Day 8: 2mg + .666*5.649mg = 5.766mg

Day 9: 2mg + .666*5.766mg = 5.844mg

Day 10: 2mg + .666*5.844mg = 5.896mg

Day 11: 2mg + .666*5.896mg = 5.931mg

Day 12: 2mg + .666*5.931mg = 5.954mg

Day 13: 2mg + .666*5.954mg = 5.969mg

Day 14: 2mg + .666*5.969mg = 5.979mg

So, based on this hypothetical 2 weeks, it does indeed appear that we hit a ceiling approaching 6 mg. 

Here are my questions for this fine community:

1. Does my math look ok? (EDIT: many thanks to mellifluousmind for correcting my math, this should be right now)

2. How can we describe this problem/solution more accurately using math? I suspect the answer involves calculus and also involves the phrase ""as the limit approaches 3"", but obviously it's been a while since I studied such things. (EDIT: actually now I think it may be a simple polynomial. But, I also realize that the real life curve for this is probably not actually linear, so there's that.)

3. If you want to dose every 24 hours (to keep your life simple), how can you calculate the dose you should take in order to hit your target blood level? In other words, we have seen that you should take 2 mg every day if you want a blood level of 6 mg. But, what should you take every day if you want an actual blood level of 2 mg?

4. Does dosing every 36 hours ensure that your blood level is the same as the dose taken?

5. Am I over thinking all this?

Bonus Tidbit on Tapering: I was reading an online article written by a suboxone-prescribing physician that advocated for ""kicker doses"" when doing a taper-down of buprenorphine. He says that for the last dose taken at a particular level, you should actually INCREASE the amount taken to help ease the transition. So say you are tapering down from 3 mg to 2 mg this week. For your last scheduled dose of 3 mg, you instead take 3.5 or 4 mg, and this makes the transition to the lower dose less painful. My understanding is that it has something to do with the very long half life, but I'm not sure. Does anyone have experience with kicker doses? Or, would anyone be interested in reading this article if I dig it up?

I was 18 and all my friends had just moved away for college. So I called a cousin of mine who's been an addict for years, and is now at the point that she OD's frequently and she's going into organ failure. Anyway, I was upset and just wanted to talk. Of course I'd been using occasionally for a couple years before this so I told her it was okay to bring her rigs and that I had 2 Dilaudid 8mg and I'd give her one. Once she got here she tried to convince me to just shoot it, and idk where the hell my brain ran off to but I did. And I have everyday since. At one point I was taking 8-10 8mg or 12mg er daily. Anytime I hung out with my cousin we parties hard. Powder, h, fentanyl patches and of course the D's. But I realized she was way too fucked up and stealing from me and trying to convince me to do blank checks at an ATM which she eventually did without my knowing and I got screwed for it. So I ditched that cunt and I didn't have many hookups. Only the few I met through her, and surprisingly my mom. 

My mom is my best friend and the first day I woke up in withdrawal she happened to be dropping something off at my house and I ran out bawling my eyes out. She has a lot of medication because she's in a lot of pain. I can't even list all the things the poor woman has. Anyway basically everything here is laced with fentanyl or carfentanyl so she gave me D's every day to try to keep me from buying something that could be laced and kill me.
  January 3rd of this year I started methadone because through the summer and fall I'd had 5 different abscesses that were all necrotic and really bad. Got them from shooting into my legs. The last 3 I had we thought I'd lose my leg. I still did coke sometimes but never touched h again, did fentanyl one more time out of desperation. Anyway I've been doing at least one Day 8 a day since I started methadone. Some days I go all out and do 10 (usually refill days) but the last few days I've really been craving something more. 

I want that heroin laced or not, I want to grab some coke and just have a really fucking good night. Problem is, I have no money (could borrow some pretty easily-so that's not too much of a problem. The problem is I only have my coke dealer and a few other old contacts left in my phone from when I used with my cousin. Most of them were her contacts but they did tell me to just come straight to them and I did a few times but it's been over a year since I contacted any of these people, and I'm nervous they'll have forgotten who I am, or because my cousin owed them money I don't want them to short me or rip me off. So idk what to do here, do I msg them and see and kinda test the waters a bit? Or try to find new connects? But that's a whole different story because I don't even know where the hell to start with that. My mom's cutting me down to like one pill a day, and I'm not cool with that. I'll cut back when I want to, when there isn't so much going on that I have to cope with. But how do I find new connections? I live in a certain famous place in Canada right across the border with a really nice horshoe waterfall..

Violent and otherwise destructive behavior was a defense mechanism, necessary to maintain a life of ruthless drug addiction in the streets.  It was the unsurprising side effect of a cold and calloused heart, which had no room for things like sentimentality or love.  Those things make a person weak and vulnerable in a world where dogs eat dogs, and even mothers eat their children.  That may sound extreme, but that is how it was to me.  That is how I saw it.  If I would sell myself for drugs, plunge a blade into my stomach, steal my grandmother‚Äôs jewelry or subject myself to the harsh reality of the streets day in and day out, what would stop me from doing the same to you?  Nothing.
---------------
We told everyone we were in love, but love was impossible for people like us.  What we really had were attempts to fill our lives‚Äô emotional voids with each other and chemical imbalances in our brains that manifested themselves as romantic fantasy.  In a very short time we became very close.  Probably because we spent every second of every day together, and every day tried us.
-------------------
Somewhere in her head, I was half baby and half bunny like her beloved Bunny O‚ÄôReilly from childhood.  Her mom had inadvertently programmed her to love that name, and her father programmed her to love men that were no good to her, even though he was pretty good to her when I knew her.  I fit the bill.  Half bunny and half baby, she called me bubby when I was capable of compassion, but when I had heroin eyes and the hiccups she just called me Clyde.
----------------------

‚ÄúHey Clyde!  How come you never call me Bonnie?‚Äù

‚ÄúCuz your name ain‚Äôt Bonnie!‚Äù

‚ÄúSo what?  A Clyde ain‚Äôt nothing without a Bonnie.  Just like you ain‚Äôt nothing without me.  You‚Äôre my Clyde.  I want to be your Bonnie.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou are my Bonnie, baby!  But, that ain‚Äôt your name.  You know how I am.  It‚Äôs like you wanting me to speak Spanish to you.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah!  I want you to call me Bonnie, and I want you to speak Spanish to me!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat am I supposed to do?  Have conversations with myself?  You can‚Äôt even understand it.  That‚Äôs weird.  Like calling you Bonnie.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo what?  Call me Bonnie, Clyde!  Speak Spanish to me!  It‚Äôs sexy!‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah right!  You‚Äôre name ain‚Äôt Bonnie, and you don‚Äôt speak Spanish!  Now, drop it!‚Äù

The trajectory and momentum of my life scared people before she came around, but now it was a 20-pound cannon ball ripping through the air about to smash anyone and anything that got in its way, even her.  Instead of one, now a couple of drug dealers wanted to kill me.  Most junkies wanted to beat me up, and at least one cop promised to send me to prison the next time she found me.  But, the real reason we left town was that the heroin was no good since Vanessa and Smokey got busted, and Danielle said she could make big bucks stripping in the City.

Eight miles north of town, heading to Colorado, a friend of ours called me up and asked if we could score for a kid who was new to town at the homeless shelter.  We came over.  The kid sniffled and his eyes watered when he yawned.  He was sick for sure, so we said we would pick up from Joe and be right back.  But we drove to the city after we scored from Joe.  Our friend called to tell us that we were disgusting pieces of trash, and he was right.   We departed in the grainy black and white of a 1930s movie house featuring Bela Lugosi as Dracula.  We were some mad scientist‚Äôs undead creatures fleeing to the hills from an angry mob of town folk with their pitchforks and torches.

That first week in the city is mostly a blur.  Somehow, we got a hold of some speed and slunk up and down the street in the Camry, suspicious as they get, at all hours of the morning, but the cops never bothered us for it.  At a 24-hour donut shop, we took the two dollars and 39 cents out of the tip jar.  It must have been early in the month when her SSI check came in, because we were in and out of adult novelty shops across the city buying all kinds of stuff and even had a hotel room.  We made connections with new dealers, and let some homeless guy videotape us having sex in a hotel room one night.  I stole a pair of stilettos for her, but there was something we had to take care of before she could start stripping.

Not long before we left town I missed an injection and deposited the warm, dirt water of a rinse into the muscle of her forearm.  She was thin.  Her veins rolled a lot, and she moved around when I dug in her arm trying to register blood.  The miss turned into an abscess the size of a golf ball, so we took matters into our own hands in a hotel room.

We stole a pack of shaving razors, a bottle of hydrogen peroxide, some gauze and tape.  I broke the thin blade out of one of the shavers and snapped it in half.  In the poorly lit bathroom she stood in the tub, while I knelt on the floor outside of it.  Danielle shook, and her lips curled in distress.  With her right wrist in my left hand I looked at her and said with a smile,

‚ÄúNow baby, I know that I look like one, but I feel like I should tell you that I‚Äôm not actually a doctor.‚Äù

‚ÄúShut up!  It‚Äôs not funny!  Now hurry up!‚Äù

I pushed the sharp side of the blade into the thin, yellowed skin on the head of her abscess.  A snake of black blood and green puss slithered down her arm and thudded in clumps on the floor by the drain.  She recoiled, but I held her wrist and pulled her back.

‚ÄúNow, we have to squeeze it.‚Äù  I pinched her flesh on either side of the bleeding wound and squeezed it.  More blood and puss oozed out.  Her body shuddered, and she groaned curse words.  We were high on heroin, but it didn‚Äôt make much difference for her.  It was painful.  I poked a hole into the top of the bottle of peroxide and sprayed a jet of the fluid into her wound.  It fizzed and foamed on the blood.

‚ÄúOkay.  That should be good.‚Äù  We wrapped it in gauze and taped it up and went to sleep.

The next night we went up to The Bus Stop to get her job at the strip club back.  After 15 minutes of waiting in the car, she walked out fuming and cursing back at one of the bouncers, and he screamed from across the parking lot that she was a junkie whore.  They did not want her back with a bandage on her arm like that.  So we headed back home.

I wasn‚Äôt afraid of the death threats there, because if there was anything I knew about back home, it was that no one‚Äôs word was worth much.  The people who wanted to kill me would have to find me first, and even if they did, they would have to deal with me when they did.  I‚Äôm not saying that they weren‚Äôt dangerous people.  They were, but what I am saying is that when it came down to it, so was I.

30 minutes out of the city a blizzard blinded us, and snow covered the interstate.  The radio played.  The heater warmed the car.  She sat naked in the passenger seat, and my hand rested between her legs when the car spun off the road.  The car did a few 360s on the highway, before we slid down the embankment of the median.  In two minutes a cop came to help us, so she put on a jacket and rolled down the window.  He told us to get off the road once he helped us get back onto it.  We stopped at the rest stop a few miles up the highway and spent the night.

When we woke up, it was light and the roads were safe.  I found the ten-dollar bag of heroin we lost under the seat the night before and split it with her.  It was the last of what we bought for a guy that sent us 100 dollars from home a few days before.  He thought we would bring him some back some heroin from the city,
but now it was all gone.

‚ÄúWhat do you think, baby?  It‚Äôs a four-hour ride back home, and the dope‚Äôs no good there.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know, bubby.  I know.  Let‚Äôs go back to the city.‚Äù

At first I felt sorry for him and he seemed nice, but then he would start ripping me off (I should have known when the very first time I met him he asked me if I wanted xanax, so I paid 5 for a bar, the police question us (but he got away) for loitering, and he didn't even keep the bar for me or gave me the money back, but since it was only 5 bucks I let it go at the time). Like, I paid 20 for a gram of weed once, waited like 3 hours and he gives me 2 5 mg oxy pills instead. I don't think I even got high off the oxy, or barely got a buzz. Fucking middles, man. He also turned out to be an arrogant ass who asked me to try heroin (I said no, partly because it was a fucking Tuesday morning and I had Organic Chemistry lab that day, also I didn't want to mess with needles). One time he also asked me to pay for most of a gram, and I thought I would get to keep it for later, but while I was in the restroom this motherfucker rolls it into a blunt to share with a shit load of people and then has the audacity to call me an asshole when I pointed out that I paid for most of the weed and never gave him permission to roll a blunt for everyone. Even though I shared my weed, no one would share their alcohol with me (I was under 21 at the time). I was also jealous of him, as he seemed to be getting all the girls and people seemed to forgive him more for things because he was white, while I am brown and I feel like I have to work harder to be accepted by society (I live in South Carolina). 


One day, I was really drunk and on bars (I only smoke weed now, I was in college so I was experimenting and being somewhat reckless), and I saw him. I demanded an apology from him, and he refused to give me one. Being drunk and on bars, I yanked his hair, and then his friend jumps me, pins me down (he was physically superior to me, but I didn't even notice him when I confronted the kid) and hits me on the head multiple times (luckily, not hard enough to give me significant brain damage).


The who jumped me's girlfriend then demanded that I apologize to this fucker and him. I still resented that I was expected to give an apology after I was screwed over so much. He and another friend approached me sometime on campus I later learned that he was a heroin and crack addict, and he soon got hepatitis C from sharing needles (he was overdosing, and someone else had to administer adrenaline to him, but that needle was contaminated). At that point I cut off all ties with him (he asked me for klonopin or weed, and I basically told him to fuck off). 


Some time after that, he fatally overdosed on heroin. I have complicated feelings about his death. The feelings of unfinished business, wondering whether it was partly my fault he was dead since I picked a fight with him, and the envy I felt of his friends saying they adored him and gushed over him, although logically I knew that was partly because he was dead. 


Some questions:


-How likely is it that his overdose was intentional? I don't know how easy it is to overdose on heroin, so I don't know how easily someone can accidentally overdose. Like, with a large tolerance, would you have to try to overdose? I wonder if maybe his heroin had fentanyl in it and that was why he died. Even if it was heroin without fent, is it possible to overdose with just one shot? I wasn't there though, so I don't know. If his overdose was intentional, then I feel like me and him weren't that different since I feel enough emotional pain to fantasize about suicide, one of which is intentional overdose (I don't have access to opioids at the moment), I guess because his death imprinted that idea onto me. 



-Did his manipulation have a lot to do with his heroin and crack use, or was he just being an asshole and the drugs had very little to do with it? I never experienced opioid withdrawal so I don't know how bad it is. 


-He was homeless, but he claimed he chose to be homeless. Why would someone choose to be homeless? 



-How should I seek closure for his death? I speak to a therapist weekly and am going to speak to her today, partly about this topic. For those who have had friends or a complicated relationship with someone who overdosed, how did you deal with it?

IÔ∏è have still been able to fly under the radar with cell phone usage, which has been a lifesaver, IÔ∏è am now fresh out of smokes (tobacco) and Code Red Mountain Dew and am without access to funds to purchase more of either. So the next 8 days will be tougher than initially expected. 

My roommate is a lil‚Äô bitch but the staff like me more than they like him bc he tries to dime everyone out, any chance he gets. 

IÔ∏è hope this letter finds you all very well. IÔ∏è shall return soon-ish. IÔ∏è have no specific plans to use in the days following my release but I‚Äôm not going to be naive and say it will never happen again. Stay safe so that you are all still running around this place on the 17th. Feel free to send me any good vibes or whatever you want to send me <3 

IÔ∏è Love (most of) you

I see this all the time on this subreddit and it doesn't make sense to me. I'm an addict also for quite a few years. 

What I mean by the fact that it doesn't make sense is that you guys will say that and at the same time if someone wants to try alcohol, ciggs etc. , you'll pretty much turn a blind eye and consider that ok. 

Yes, everyone who tries opiates has a chance of becoming addicted but that is the case for almost every substance. Also, being an alcoholic is way more damaging to the body and usually to those around you. 

Yet, I only see the case being made for opiates and not just here or because this is the opiates subreddit but you guys seem to think that opiates are some kind of mega drug that trumps all other substances and this is simply not true.

I've had way worse problems from gaba agonists/antagonists like benzos, gabapentin, baclofen etc. . The withdrawals really don't compare, I would chose an opiate w/d anyday compared to a benzo/gabapentin/ghb w/d. ",1510212140.0

**Tinychat can be VERY shitty about the mobile app so if you can connect with a computer, that is the best option.**  
firstly, this chat is not affiliated with this subreddit or its moderators, and has its own moderators, rules, and etiquette. if you feel someone there has slighted you take it up with the moderators of tinychat, as it is completely unaffiliated with and not endorsed by this or any other subreddit.  
just a reminder and an announcement that a bunch of your fellow degenerate junkies, chippers, and tourists hang out in [our very own tinychat room](http://tinychat.com/ropiatesubchat) which has been an ongoing tradition for something like four years now. the location, for those who can't do links for whatever reason, is http://tinychat.com/ropiatesubchat.  

tinychat is an extremely buggy videochat client, but also the only one that fills its particular niche---that being, anyone who knows the room name may enter, and it has a youtube player. any technical difficulties may be addressed by the moderator, namely me. we like to hang out, listen to music, talk about random shit, and lately have even had our own resident sketch artist who draws random crap upon request. the primary purposes for the room's existence are companionship and harm reduction---it's nice to be able to shoot up with others around, even if you are technically alone in the non-digital sense, and have people keeping an eye on you. we're also glad to help with any problems you might be having, or questions you might need answered. we aim to be a welcoming, friendly space for the members of this subreddit to do what we do in good company without judgement. so stop by if you are bored, or just need to talk.  

if it appears like there is a moderator in the room but who is not speaking, just type a few sentences to summon them back. if you are on mobile it is not immediately apparent that there is anyone in the room. either click the button shaped like an outline of a person (i think) to see the list, or say hello to see if anyone responds.  


rules:  

1. pick a unique username. this is to protect other users so we know who is who, given the nature of the sort of activities we enjoy. 

2. no lurking. again, to protect the other users. if you come in the room be prepared to introduce yourself and participate for at least a few minutes so we know you're not up to any shenanigans. if you are lurking you will be warned and then given a generous ten minutes to announce yourself. if the time runs out, you will be kicked (not banned) until you are ready to come in and actually participate. if you are a known member whose identity can be confirmed, this rule is not applicable.  

3. no -isms or hate speech, even accidental. one warning will be issued, any continued insistence on such behavior will result in a ban. bans can be contested by pm'ing a moderator (me). this includes but is not limited to racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia. for example, if you are not black, use of the n-word, even with the -a ending, will not be tolerated. i don't care if your friend down the block lets you say it, it's not your lane. 

4. no auditory fuckery. due to peculiarities of the transmission of sound over a chat, certain echos and effects can be amplified to the point of being severely distressing. if it is determined that your end is causing an echo you will be asked to use headphones, or to mute your microphone when not speaking. deliberately making strange or unpleasant noises to annoy other chatters will not be tolerated, and your broadcast will be closed. (this only means that your video/audio feed will be terminated--you will still be allowed to type.)  

i know the rules seem like a lot but there's really only four of them, and only two that pertain to just behaving in a manner that isn't dickish.

7bpuuz,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7bpuuz/clean_wait_wut/,17,https://redd.it/7bpuuz,dori_88,Clean? ...Wait ...WUT!?,"Today I had my appointment at the specialist's clinic that was a day's drive away from me. I got a second opinion on my pain issues. 

After spending 8am - 2pm there I walked away from it knowing that I definitely have serious pain issues and that the opiates are putting me into a vicious cycle of pain, withdrawal, and feeling ""okayish"" 

I am on 30-45mgs of oxycodone per day right now. 

It doesn't make sense to up the dosage, it doesn't make sense to be on this for life and it doesn't make sense to keep going through the ups & downs of withdrawal. Especially because I'm currently experiencing withdrawals *nightly* around 3 in the morning. I can't handle to constant yo-yo*ing* of my medical problems and upset with hospital visits etc.

The next step in all of this is that I'm going to see an addictionologist. 

Then I will go on suboxone patches (butrans patch) for pain purposes at a low dose. It'll all be done, inpatient. Mainly because I had a problem with suboxone film strips that you take orally. I had a seizure on that. 

If it's successful and I can tolerate the butrans patch (goes on skin) then I can handle the pain better and pick up my life and once I gain stability on the patch, I can begin to get off these narcotic type medications entirely. 

It scares me though because my pain problems are severe. I just don't know anymore. I'm really on the fence about this decision. 

This isn't some Malibu recovery center that charges you $50,000 upfront since insurance won't cover it either, it's a hospital program that my insurance will cover and that has a real shot at weening me down and directing me correctly. 

The fact that it's a hospitalized medical thing makes me feel a bit more comfortable, but I am completely unsure of everything. I may want to stay with what I know and what is predictable which is creating a lot of turmoil in my life or I can go, get serious, take this route and hope for the best.

Cliff's sibling bought me a sub two days earlier so in my gratitude I was happy to drop by and help them out with electronics before work. As for Cliff's frined Chuck, he loves benzos and cannot get enough of them. I've witnessed him rail three bars in a single sitting. 

&nbsp;


Two nights earlier Cliff took a foorballs and woke up with an empty bottle and a bunch scattered on the floor. Chuck was willing to trade some benzos for cash or dope and Cliff would be interested in such an offer if he had help finding the missing foorballs.


As a result, Chuck came over to help Cliff look around his filthy floor. Prior to arriving Cliff asked me to bring two garbage bags. Upon bringing two, Chuck indicated he expected me to help with cleaning, that we needed lots of bags. and when I responded to state that I only bought two bags he manufactured yet another one of his many cliches. 

""You bought two, you should have bought *too* many.""


Whatever, IDGAF, I don't like benzos as much and didn't need them to sleep as I had a sub. Speaking of which, I ran to the neighboring apartment, spliced a power cord and earned ten dollars that allowed me to buy an extra sub which I shared with my friend Cliff so he wouldn't be sick when he went to his doctor.


This also allowed me to avoid assisting in the cleaning operations.


&nbsp;


**The point I wanted to convey that is in the title is as follows:**


Chuck said he was there helping Cliff look for Xanax because he wanted to help his friend. I told him, ""look it's okay to say you're helping Cliff look for his Xanax so that you could receive some for your efforts."" He denied this premise but whatever I stayed firm in my point and belief on the matter.

&nbsp;

I just thought it was amusing and funny that Chuck was so insistent that he was just helping cliff clean his room to look for missing Xanax for solely altruistic reasons.",1510185105.0

I wonder where I'd be, how much money I'd have, what sort of relationship, home or family I'd have of my own if I hadn't wasted a decade doing this stupid shit.

I feel like when you're using, you don't mature. So really, I'm about 18 mentally.. even though I'm really 35 next week. A few periods of clean time have brough my mental age up a bit and I can't stop thinking about where my career or life would be right now.

I've wasted countless thousands.. hundreds of thousands, literally. It's scary thinking about it. The only thing that makes me feel better is that I would just have more 'stuff', like I would have been addicted to something else and have a giant collection of Warhammer figures or computer games etc.


So, even though I have nothing (everything I did have and cared for, I pawned off - like my music collection, my music studio gear - a decade there of synths, software, hardware, speakers etc. my pride and joy, what a waste of time all those music production courses were and piano lessons, as I haven't sat down and played in years). I guess I live a more zen life. I guess you could say my life is very Buddhist right now - with no possessions, comes no responsibility or worry about all your 'stuff'.

There needs to be clean sets around. There is an exchange here but it's one day a week and at like 230 and I can never get there. Pharmacies and Wally world won't sell.

Of course I relapsed. Went broke again. But this time was different. 

I made the jump.

Pills to H. Idk how I got here. I hate myself and this shit. I know of so many ways to stop, and why I should & how grossed out at myself I am. I'd do anything to know what the fuck those little blue pills actually were & what they did. I swear.  Everyday something shitty happens and I some how tell myself this is all OK to do. Numb the pain. It's alllllll good. 

 Now EVERYONES prices went up. $30 a fucking pill. I need 60 mg just to really feel something. Broke as fuck. Two weeks ago I found another plug for H. (My last one was a dick.. even if he was right. See my last post if you give a shit) But ""lucky"" me, it's still too far away to even want to grab it daily. I swear On that side of this shit hole area I always get shorted.

 I don't even remember why or how but two weeks ago some how I convinced my pill dude to introduce me to someone who sells H. Always on the block, the block only 15 mins from my work. Always on deck, always when I need it. Just the fourth time I bought he gave me extra (they never do that here). I wish being a ""beautiful"" girl they only know as baby (lol) didn't help so much but fuck yeah it does. Anyways, here we are. 

There's only BTH here. I can only bring myself to smoke it. I tried snorting it and I think I'm just doing it wrong. I can't bring myself to shoot it. like taking it any different way makes it any better. Ha

The only person who knew died almost a year ago so that didn't help. I swear we were both finally doing it. Now I'm alone. Anyone who kinda knew thinks I stopped. Which I did but only for 6 months at the longest. Whata joke. No one knows. Idk why I'm even posting this. I always leave you guys when I'm trying to be ""sober"" because it's so goddamn tempting. And I'm always right back here, usually worse than before.

 I know most of you probably don't give a fuck, have been there, here & back & probably stopped reading. it's always the same story. But it really fucking isn't. I know I'm not the only one who wonders how the fuck they got here. I know I don't want this to be... it. I don't want to die, or OD, or both. Especially have my family & friends find me that way. that would fucking end them. 

I know I'm capable of stopping. or at least getting on subs. I know I have support. I know I'll (fucking hopefully) never be homeless. I know I'm just being a big cry baby who can't get over losing my best friend & a boyfriend, especially to the same thing that is ruining me. People lose people everyday. What the fuck is wrong with me, my brain won't let me move on. It's killing me. 

I tell myself everyday I'd do ANYTHING if I could just wake up tomorrow and stop. Then there I am either with a pill broken down or a fucking piece of tinfoil. I thought I hit rock bottom before... lmao. I wish I knew what my purpose here on this dumb ass planet was. even just a sign that to tell me that I actually even have one. I don't know how much longer I can do it. Whatever the fuck that means. 

I don't even know why I wrote this. I only know why I did it here - because this is the only ""safe"" place I have to talk about this legit second life I have. The only place where hopefully someone else gets it. Most of you probably don't even remember me since I always come and go, but very many of you have helped me in a lot of ways. I wish I could thank those people. At least I can thank whoever tf might be crazy enough to read this post of me basically whining. Thank you. Hopefully someday I'll be able to post about doing the exact opposite.

Someday... Hopefully.  ",1510325554.0

Because of the Pregabalin, and not having eaten almost nothing during the day, I was extremely hungry, so I ate a BIG dinner based on home made French Fries and ""Milanese"" (aye, I am from Argentina). All was well with the world and eventually I went to bed. I tried to read a book but I kept almost loosing consciousness, so I decided to sleep.
I don't remember sleeping so fast and so well in months. I didn't get up during the night at all. My breathing was calm and everything felt all right.
Now, when I woke up, at 6.30am, I was almost dizzy of pleasure, I could feel it in all my body, it was too extreme too get out of bed, and also, it was so early, that I decided to sleep a little bit more.
I got up at 8.30am, still feeling a lot of pleasure, but thinking about the coming day, I still had more Tramadol for one or two more ""sessions"", Pregabalin, and some Lorazepam.

Point is, normally Tramadol gets bashed as an horrible drug -and might be it in some cases, I mean, an opioid that has to be metabolized to become powerful and it is at the same time a strong-instant SSRI? well, for some cases, it is awesome. It is better than other opioids or opiates that lasts a few hours, and it is definitely better than the ones that hits you so hard that all you do is nod (yes, I have tried ""real"" opioids in the past).
The key is having a very low tolerance, and not taking antidepressants. Then Tramadol+Pregabalin and some benzo throw there is heaven.

Last dose Monday Am, about 60-70mg oxy.

Typical dose about 150.

So when can I take a single dose without restarting withdrawals from day 1? Day 5? Day 7? Day 10?

I only have enough for one dose really(maybe 2) no refill til later this month. But I don't want to put withdrawals back to day 1. 

I'm going on vacay Saturday morning. For a week. 

So if I bring my oxy, can I take a single dose? At what point am I clear.....when it comes to withdrawals only.

Hopefully you all understand the want. I'm not quitting for good. I have a date in mind. But I'll reup later this month. But would love to nod off on the beach in the middle of nowhere. Don't wanna reset withdrawals for vacay. Surely y'all understand haha ;)

**Tinychat can be VERY shitty about the mobile app so if you can connect with a computer, that is the best option.**  
firstly, this chat is not affiliated with this subreddit or its moderators, and has its own moderators, rules, and etiquette. if you feel someone there has slighted you take it up with the moderators of tinychat, as it is completely unaffiliated with and not endorsed by this or any other subreddit.  
just a reminder and an announcement that a bunch of your fellow degenerate junkies, chippers, and tourists hang out in [our very own tinychat room](http://tinychat.com/ropiatesubchat) which has been an ongoing tradition for something like four years now. the location, for those who can't do links for whatever reason, is http://tinychat.com/ropiatesubchat.  

tinychat is an extremely buggy videochat client, but also the only one that fills its particular niche---that being, anyone who knows the room name may enter, and it has a youtube player. any technical difficulties may be addressed by the moderator, namely me. we like to hang out, listen to music, talk about random shit, and lately have even had our own resident sketch artist who draws random crap upon request. the primary purposes for the room's existence are companionship and harm reduction---it's nice to be able to shoot up with others around, even if you are technically alone in the non-digital sense, and have people keeping an eye on you. we're also glad to help with any problems you might be having, or questions you might need answered. we aim to be a welcoming, friendly space for the members of this subreddit to do what we do in good company without judgement. so stop by if you are bored, or just need to talk.  

if it appears like there is a moderator in the room but who is not speaking, just type a few sentences to summon them back. if you are on mobile it is not immediately apparent that there is anyone in the room. either click the button shaped like an outline of a person (i think) to see the list, or say hello to see if anyone responds.  


rules:  

1. pick a unique username. this is to protect other users so we know who is who, given the nature of the sort of activities we enjoy. 

2. no lurking. again, to protect the other users. if you come in the room be prepared to introduce yourself and participate for at least a few minutes so we know you're not up to any shenanigans. if you are lurking you will be warned and then given a generous ten minutes to announce yourself. if the time runs out, you will be kicked (not banned) until you are ready to come in and actually participate. if you are a known member whose identity can be confirmed, this rule is not applicable.  

3. no -isms or hate speech, even accidental. one warning will be issued, any continued insistence on such behavior will result in a ban. bans can be contested by pm'ing a moderator (me). this includes but is not limited to racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia. for example, if you are not black, use of the n-word, even with the -a ending, will not be tolerated. i don't care if your friend down the block lets you say it, it's not your lane. 

4. no auditory fuckery. due to peculiarities of the transmission of sound over a chat, certain echos and effects can be amplified to the point of being severely distressing. if it is determined that your end is causing an echo you will be asked to use headphones, or to mute your microphone when not speaking. deliberately making strange or unpleasant noises to annoy other chatters will not be tolerated, and your broadcast will be closed. (this only means that your video/audio feed will be terminated--you will still be allowed to type.)  

i know the rules seem like a lot but there's really only four of them, and only two that pertain to just behaving in a manner that isn't dickish.

Well I lapsed after 8 days and used a few evenings until 50+ hours ago and I haven't used since but I'm struggling way harder this time and idk why. Last time it wasn't so bad bar some emotional difficulty, but that was it really. 

My anxiety has been dissociative since the start of the year and whadda ya know yesterday I start getting major Depersonalization/Derealization. Now the really annoying bit is this started after I woke up from an evening nap (which can be a bit disorienting) and physically I'm not horrible; my stool is alright, apetite isn't great but no nausea or vomiting, slept well last night. So either a) this is withdrawal anxiety manifesting via DPDR/feeling ** Really ** out of it or b) it's psychosomatic and I'm associating this experience negatively (which is why I feel so out of proportion to last week's attempt). Last night I was so anxious I had to sit down and accept the possibility of getting acutely anxious again and having to come out to my mum about my use..(which would not be fun at all, moreso for her), I did proceed to calm down following accepting this uncertainty but I'm overall struggling and feeling very disconnected (On TOP of all the guilt, regret and blah blah), arr this is shite and I don't even know if it's directly WD or not. The thought that a bit of H or Codeine would have me chill the fuck right down is a bit appealing but overall I'm just caught up in feeling extremely disconnected and mum has indeed noticed (though all that I'm exhibiting has resulted from my anxiety alone at times so she's not that shocked by it).",1510282531.0

7by57k,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7by57k/sub_taper_with_dope_interspersed_an_oxymoron_of/,2,https://redd.it/7by57k,horrorfannj,"Sub taper with dope interspersed- an oxymoron of sorts, yes, but I have a question.","So I've been taking sub since Saturday to try and taper, but of course things have been going well and my boy keeps throwing me buns and as an addict its hard to resist. But, I'm at the point where I'm just done, so I'm going to continue tapering and not using dope anymore.

But anyway:

I have been taking 1mg sub every morning since Sunday. So, Sunday I took 1mg sub and didn't use. The next day, I took 1.5mg sub or so in the morning, and I ended up getting some dope later on that day. It was good quality, I felt pretty high, and all was well. The next day, I really didn't feel sick even almost at 24 hours. Usually I would feel sick around 18 hours, sometimes less. But, I did not, and I took my sub in the morning after almost 24 hours, because I wanted to continue to taper. I ended up getting another bun, but it was shit quality, so I didn't feel anything. Whatever. 

Then yesterday, I took about .5 mg sub, but I wasn't even feeling sick at all, and I had just about hit 24 hours again. I used again, a bun of good quality dope, felt high, and that was that.

We come to today, and I was not even feeling a slight hint of withdrawal symptoms after 24 hours. I mean... no hints of achiness, no yawning, no watery eyes, no restlessness, no anxiety, not even intense cravings. I actually was in a GREAT mood, when usually I'm fiending hard as fuck when it's been 16-18 hours since I last used. And I took a very small piece of sub yesterday, and the dope I did was good, but if I had just done the dope, I would have been sick after like I said... 18 hours or so. The exact amount of hours is irrelevant I suppose; it's just that by a whole day later I KNOW I would be sick.

So, I didn't bother taking any sub today, because I knew I had to stop using dope in order to really commit to being clean. So I did what any good junkie would, and I did my last bundle today. I know everyone has said ""this is my last one"" plenty of times when it wasn't, but I finally have made the decision that I really want to stop. It's just not worth it anymore; getting high for a few hours, and then all you can think about is copping again tomorrow and how you're going to get the money for it. The high isn't fun anymore and I'm sick of hurting the people I love by using. It's just fucked. I want to save my relationship because my girl is basically on her last nerve with me, because I keep using. I can't do it anymore.

Anyway, emotional nonsense aside, I am wondering if using the dope after taking the sub and in between my doses has affected my sub taper at all. I am planning on taking 1 mg each morning for the next few days, and then .5 mg, and then just jumping off. 

Judging by how long I've been able to go before I felt sick, I feel like the sub stayed in my system, and I was able to ""cheat"" this system and get high, while still reaping the benefits of the long-lasting sub.

So, did I really set myself back with using the dope at all? Or did the sub remain in my system, and its just like I've been tapering and was lucky to get high? I really don't need a lot of sub to stay well. At this point, all I need is .5-1mg... I feel the hardest part with sub is the first day of induction, switching from dope to subs. Hitting the sweet spot is tough. But I always try and use a low amount so as to make the taper easy as possible.

Hope this wasn't too convoluted.

I really want to do this, guys. I've spent way too much time wasted on dope. It just isn't worth it anymore. I hope all of you can recover too once you're ready. Thanks for everything.",1510279594.0

My favorite strain is red Bali. Also due to Kratom being hydrophobic it's hard to mix it into a liquid to drink. I recommend getting an empty water bottle and putting a small amount of either chocolate milk or eggnog in the bottle, about a gulps worth. Take a small piece of paper and fold it in half length wise creating a sort of troff. Spoon your Kratom into the troff and put one end to the top of the bottle. Tilt up the troff and lightly tap the bottom of it to help the Kratom slide into the bottle. Screw on the cap and shake like a mad man. This works much better then trying to stir in the Kratom with a spoon.

I've just been wondering why is it that I have NEVER not once seen an Oxycodone analogue? 

Oxycodone is probably the most sought after opiate on this planet why does nobody make it? You can chemists in China making all these fentanyl analogies but they wont venture off into other semi-synthetic opiates? 

Can any of you give me your advice/experience with the fentanyl analogues ? Are they euphoric, worth the money (125$ for 10g of fentanyl is a fuck ton is it now considering fent is measured in Mcg). 

China chemists haven't even tried to make mxe yet. ",1510260875.0

I live in an area know for drug problems and I walk my dog every single day.  I watch him like a hawk normally, but especially now.

If you choose to use opiates there is a high risk, especially now, of it containing fentanyl.  Fentanyl sticks to whatever it touches and that packaging becomes lethal to any person or animal that touches it.  

I have no issues if you choose to do opiates, but please dispose of your packaging into an appropriate receptacle.  Don't risk other people or animals lives because you are too lazy to throw your shit in a trash can.  

This sub is for harm reduction and spreading this info can definitely help reduce harm to innocent people and animals.  Please, I am begging all of you to spread this info to your fellow bropiates and dealers.


Edit-moral of the story is. . . And is clearly stated. 

Using opiates responsibly=fine
Being a littering POS=not fine.

A few of y'all completely missed that this is about reducing harm of others who are innocents in regards to the drug world.  If you don't ever litter than we are cool.  I think the ones that got upset by this post are possibly just mad because they are litterbugs.  I blast littering on every sub when it comes up.  

Drug use alone is not selfish and if you choose to live that way please keep yourself and others safe. . . It isn't that hard, man.",1510244407.0
