But the problem is, i'm a snorter and this shit just will NOT properly break down into decent lines. I end up snorting small clumpy pebbles of dope instead of a nice & powdered line like the other stuff i used to get. Its decent dope but I cant help but feel like it gets wasted in my nostrils cause its not coating it, it just clumps up into boogers.

So whats a good way to fix this?? I want it to be nice and dry.
I tried to hot plate it like with coke and it ended up just turning into a tar-like consistency. Maybe a silica packet from some beef jerky or something? Anyone want to weigh in on this?",1511883041.0

so after paying attention to the opiate scene i knew i would have a couple of options open to me to try and find a good pill hookup. although i do want to get into dnms im just not ready yet and getting a package right now is my biggest prob. 

after a few misses on cl finally got someone to work with me. sweet. turns out they happen to be very close by which is too ironic for this giant spread out city. i mean we are very close.



so i put in a small order to test out the product and of course the guy is on time to our mellow meet up and come through. has since come through one more time. very very happy with a solid new connect. was stressing that i was going to hit wd before i found a new source but that wasnt the case.


as much as he is a very good source i will continue to develop and nurture our relationship i will also be on the lookout for two to three backup sources. you never ever know when you might need the backup so its always good to have.



anyway here i am felling very very good properly medicated and opiated at just a mere 10mgs of hydrocodone but my tolerance is very low for now and i would like to try and keep it that way for a little while at least!

It feels good to be back here because I love this sub, it’s a little bittersweet because coming back here means that I relapsed after a year of clean time. I went to rehab and followed it up with 3 months of outpatient. I was doing great in sobriety, got a girlfriend that I really like and my job is going really well. I got jumped by 2 guys when I was drunk about a month ago (when I say sober I mean from opiates) and had to be rushed to the ER with brain bleeding, had to get stitches in my lip, and the inside of my ear was fractured. I was blind sided by the way, I had no idea who these fucks were and they just walked up and said hey can I ask you a question, and then started swinging. Anyways, I was fed copious amounts of opiates in the ER for about 16-18 hours, mainly dillies via IV and then some oral percs. 
I was prescribed 5 mg of percs without any APAP and have them to my roommate to dish out to me so I wouldn’t abuse them. He is well aware of my addiction and kept me on a very tight schedule. Unfortunately it was not enough and I was in really severe pain, mainly from my ear because they stuck a wick in it to help heal the fractures and it contributed to my headaches being much more severe. Anyways, when it came time to get my refill I didn’t inform anyone and took them myself because I was still in a lot of pain and wanted to be in control of my own dose as one 5 mg percs every 4-6 hours wasn’t cutting it. Well as I’m sure you can guess I went through 30 in 3 days. When that ran out I was still in pain and managed to find my old dealer’s number and have been doing black on and off since then. It’s caused a lot of problems in my relationship, with friends, family, etc. but I’m back in the cycle again. Withdrawals aren’t terrible but they still suck...I get sober for a couple days use for a couple days. I am thinking about trying Kratom, I have been reading up on it but I’m curious to hear any of your thoughts? Anything you guys would like to share on relapse, kratom, drug addiction, etc would be cool. Haha not gonna lie the first time using black was amazing, that warm feeling taking over my body and the instant relief. But every time after that was a mixture of bliss and guilt, I am no longer in really bad pain and I don’t really need opiates; at least not strong ones, which is why I am also interested in kratom.

I was sweating, hot/cold flashes, whole body aches, depression and restless legs you name it. I should also note that I took 10 g's of Kratom Saturday night, and 20g's of Kratom yesterday too so I could just be flushing that out of my system and experiencing withdrawals from that. I also have been taking loperamide every other day in 10mg doses.

I'm in pain management and I usually run out of my scripts early, but I typically remember to put a few pills aside in case of a random urine test. Have never had any problems with this method before, but I forgot to set my usual few aside this month.

I used my last pills today (a lot earlier than usual, it was a bad pain month), but I have an appt on the 8th to discuss a med change with my doctor anyway. The current regime just isn't cutting it- obviously. I could be due for a UA at that appointment (I'm tested every 3 months and it's been 3 months), so I'm thinking of freezing my urine tomorrow while I would still show positive for my meds.

What are the ins and outs of this process? Storing? Reheating? I have a general idea, I just don't want to do it wrong.

And yes, I know it's terrible I don't stick to my script, etc etc etc. I do the best I can with the pain I'm in. For now, I'm not supplementing the script. I go my time without my meds. I'm just kicking myself for not covering my ass as usual. 

Any help would be greatly appreciated. I check in with this community a lot. I have nothing but love for you guys. <3",1511838650.0

I gagged on the smoke because I was dope sick as fuck.  (does anyone else find cigarettes awful and make you gag when dope sick even though you're a heavy smoker?)

I pissed out of my ass three times within 45 minutes of being awake.  It was AWFUL.  I finished my shit and sat back down.  Within about 10 minutes I had to fart and felt another wave of poo ready to be extruded out of my anus.  I finished that shit and sat back down... and then, once again, attempted to smoke a cigarette.  I didn't gag this time but after about three puffs I felt ANOTHER wave of diarrhea.  ""Where is all this SHIT COMING FROM?!"" I asked myself.

I took one final huge liquid sludgy dump and felt a wave of nausea come over me.  I puked in the bathtub and nearly passed out because of how hard I was heaving.  Snot filled my nose and my tear ducts went into overdrive.  My stomach was real sour and whatever acidic shit I puked up made my throat close up and I had trouble breathing for a few seconds.

I cleaned off in the shower and got out of the bathroom feeling EXHAUSTED and DRAINED beyond belief.  I just crashed into my chair and sat there like a zombie.  Muddled, cloudy thoughts filled my head due to being dope-sick and my eyes found a point on the wall to just stare at lazily, feeling chills on my shoulders and arms causing my arm hair to raise on their ends with chill-bumps all over my forearms.

I finally broke down and pawned some computer equipment I own since I had access to a car this morning and RACED to my dope man.  After what felt like an eternity, due to being so ill, I arrived at my dope man's crib and scored a blue.

I crushed that bitch up in a Wendy's straw (shit straws, BTW, don't recommend them unless you want the straw to split and your dope to fly out like baby powder everywhere when you are crushing the pill within the straw.  It's like a conspiracy.  Alot of restaurants have started using straws with less plastic in them or something, like they know folks are using them to snort roxies!) and snorted that bitch as carefully as I could and then snorted a half-full bottle cap of water to get the drain going and to make sure there was not any powder going to fall out of my nose and shit.

I immediately went from being dope-sick to high but even though I was now ""well"" the sheer stress on my body from being sick was still somewhat apparent for a while.  Relief is not a big enough word when that oxycodone hit my brain that was crying out for the chemical imbalance to be corrected.

What an amazing feeling, getting that fix when I was hopelessly in withdrawal and shitting on myself and puking.

The sweats and chill-bumps went away immediately and my mood went from depressed to exuberant within a matter of seconds as the oxycodone binding to my opiate receptors caused my body to correct itself.

I was finally well.

Agents intercepted a shipment of Cyclopropyl fentanyl, a derivative of fentanyl, according to a criminal complaint.

Portland police said the package was linked to an overdose death that happened in Green Bay, Wisconsin.

According to police, 80 people have died in accidental overdoses from synthetic opioids such as fentanyl since 2014. The deaths are increasing, the Oregon State Medical Examiner's Office said.

Joseph Caruso, 33, was arrested outside his Lake Oswego apartment on Nov. 21 for the sale and distribution of illegal narcotics, according to court records. He is now in federal custody.

A U.S. postal inspector at the Portland International Airport air cargo facility got suspicious after picking up a yellow padded envelope marked “Knitting Needle.” The international package had been shipped from Shanghai.

The inspector said the contents felt like powder, not a knitting needle.

Investigators took the suspicious package to the Portland Police Bureau’s Drug and Vice Division for safe testing using a ventilated hood. Inside two heat-sealed Mylar bags, investigators said they found a plastic baggie filled with off-white powder weighing 27 grams.

The Oregon State Police lab identified the powder as Cyclopropyl fentanyl, according to the criminal complaint.

“Cyclopropyl fentanyl is a very powerful opioid that is ingested in microgram dosages and has been the cause of several recent overdose deaths in Portland, Oregon metropolitan area,” wrote Special Agent Guy Gino of U.S. Homeland Security in a criminal complaint filed in federal court.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Oregon authorized investigators to replace the potent opioid with a harmless powder, then send the package on to the intended recipient in Lake Oswego.

Investigators said they watched Caruso remove the package from his mailbox. Then, he was placed under arrest.

Caruso has a previous conviction for possession of heroin in August of 2014.

According to court documents, Caruso was identified in a Chinese Ministry Public Security investigation after Chinese officials busted a drug organization sending fentanyl to the United States.

“Caruso’s [phone] number was associated to a package containing 50g Fentanyl addressed to another individual in the Portland, Oregon on November 1, 2016,” wrote Special Agent Gino.

A search of Caruso’s Lake Oswego address found six imports mailed to Joe Caruso between October 2016 and November 2017, explained investigators. The international packages had descriptions listed on the manifest such as “SAMPLES OF COSMETICS,” “DOLL” and “PRESENT,” said Special Agent Gino.

Investigators said two similar packages sent to a recipient in Michigan tested positive for Furanylfentanyl, an analogue of fentanyl.

Fentanyl is a powerful synthetic opioid similar to morphine, but is at least 100 times more potent.

I got in contact with an old high school friend recently, and we got to chatting about a car accident she was in. She mentioned that she only takes Tramadol, and that she has a shit ton of 10mg Perc's that she can't take because they upset her stomach. I immediately said ""well shit, if you don't want them, I'll buy them off you!"" Thinking she would wanna hop on that shit to make some extra cash. We made plans to hang out and still continued to chat for a few days. 

Then of course...she bails on me last minute. UGH I was so excited to finally get my hands on some perc's. I was literally planning my week out and legit excited to be able to have some perc's to do before work. She said we can reschedule...but we'll see if that happens. She's always been unreliable, anyway.

If we do hang, I don't wanna seem like a fiend and mention the perc's again...but shit, I want them so bad!

7ge3ga,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7ge3ga/heroin_story_i_wrote/,12,https://redd.it/7ge3ga,Throwpiateaway92,Heroin Story I wrote,"                        Sunday Brunch


“Sundays are always the same. All of the other days of the week are a little bit different but not Sunday. Sundays are always the same,” said Blake to Kenny. Kenny had just started running food at the worst Sunday brunch buffet in Jacksonville, Florida.

“That sounds like the beginning of a story,” said Kenny.

Blake doesn’t respond to that. He starts asking personal questions instead. Not really out of interest but more out of boredom. “Do you guys ever think about suicide?”

There is a collective murmur. Most people say they had thought about it. You can’t work at a restaurant without wanting to kill yourself at least once or twice a month.

“Why are you so quiet today, Greg?” Kenny was talking to me. My name is actually Grant, not Greg. I don’t correct him. I never do.

“I don’t feel good yet”

“What do you mean yet?”

“I mean I haven’t had my coffee yet.”

“You’re drinking coffee right now…”

 I don’t really know how to tell him that my “coffee” is a bit different than most people’s. I say nothing and walk away.

I walk around with a look of purpose for a bit until my relief was to show up. About 30 minutes or so. If you walk like you are going somewhere most people assume you are working when you work in a restaurant. The only problem here is that this is the worst Sunday brunch buffet in Jacksonville, Florida. Most employees only know how to do the same thing every week for their share of setting up.

I usually decorate the desserts. When I’ve had my coffee, it is done to where it doesn’t look too bad. It’s never anything to write home about, but nothing at this buffet ever is. If I haven’t had my coffee they look really bad and the whole process makes me want to throw up. Sometimes I do.

I go to the bathroom to hide for a little while and maybe throw up a few times. It’s really gross in there like it hasn’t been cleaned in a month or so and it smells really bad. I end up throwing up a few times. Sundays are always the same.
I check my call history. It had been 42 minutes since we talked. He had said 30 minutes. This is almost 50 percent more time than anticipated. Twelve more minutes than planned. Twelve lifetimes. Twelve 24-year-failed lifetimes. Twelve whole fucking minutes.

My phone rings. It’s a guy who goes by ‘Solo.’ He is a big fat black guy who I’ve never seen eat but I’d seen smoke a ton of crack. He also likes the same kind of coffee that I did.

I was never really sure how he stayed so big doing what he did. Normally what I would do when I saw Solo (which was at least once per day) is I would pretend to be a talk show host and pretended that he was my guest. I asked him all sorts of questions about his day to day life and enjoyed hearing his perspective on things like political issues and controversies that were going on at the moment. Sometimes he offered some incredibly insightful answers to my questions. Other times not so much. I enjoyed my imaginary talk show. I think Solo did too.

His life both fascinated and disgusted me. One time we were having our coffee in his kitchen, the set for our show during that session. There were maggots in his sink and an old pot with uneaten ramen noodles, or that is what Solo said it was. Flies were buzzing around the sink judging us as we indulged. Despite our stage for the day I enjoyed myself. I think Solo did too.

I don’t have time to ask Solo any questions today. I leave his car wondering what he might do throughout the day. He probably drinks coffee all day.

I walk back in through the beaten backdoor of the restaurant. I immediately go toward the bathroom. Locked. Holy fuck get out of there right now I will seriously fucking hurt you. Another whole minute goes by. Another lifetime. The door swings open. I go inside.

I close the door to my sanctuary. “It’s so nice in here,” I think to myself. There’s no real bad odor or anything. Just a good ol’ sanctuary.

I quickly start my ritual. No good day ever starts without a ritual. A flame. Some bubbles. A mouthwatering vinegar smell. A crimson cloud of liquid rushes out and flows back in. Bliss.

I walk out toward the dining room. Lee Logan is telling Alex and Blake something about “the circle of life.” This makes me smile. Alex and Blake look bored and disappointed. I enjoy the moment for them. Briefly, I pause and enjoy that very moment on behalf of every person in the restaurant. Bliss.

The restaurant is slow. Partly because it is rainy and partly because the food is terrible. There isn’t much to do for servers when it is slow especially when the mean manager isn’t there. Sunday is the mean manager’s only designated day off. Sometimes Mean Manager still shows up. She is usually sporting a mean face, albeit dressed a bit more casual on her days off. If she is not there she gets all reviews, food/beverage comps and other various restaurant reports sent to her phone. Mean Manager is a little bit nutty.
I’m standing by myself thinking about Mean Manager and a few other things about the restaurant. Alex, Blake, Kenny, and one of the high-school food runners are standing around talking about nothing in particular.

I don’t join the conversation but instead eavesdrop a bit. My thoughts were mostly about the restaurant and I fucking hate this place so eavesdropping seems better.

I get bored of this and decide it is time for more coffee. More relief. I head to the bathroom. Sundays are always the same.

I still have so much coffee. If I enjoy all of it at once it would surely kill me. I fantasize about that for a moment. Maybe after one last relief. One last ritual. It begins again. Vinegar on the stove. Red clouds in the brown sky. Bliss.

I look down at what I have left and smile.  A thought crosses the back of my mind. “I have it good now, but soon I won’t.”

And they get up and handle their day to day business. That’s probably the biggest thing I can stress. If you can just make yourself get out. Get out of bed. Get going. Force a smile. It may be tough. Go to work. Get you a Red Bull. Anyways I have just been reading some pretty gnarly sob stories, and maybe I don’t understand it completely cause I don’t fuck with H, but that’s because I have a made up mind. I won’t let it get that far. I want to be in control. 

That being said, it’s tough love guys. Get the hell up. Grab life by the balls. You can do it. You have to have a made up mind about it. AND JUST TRY TO PLAN! Set yourself up for succes.",1511939831.0

I spent a year in a country with no opiates and I finally arrived back in Australia a few weeks ago. Today I was finally reunited with my best friend. 

I got 3 points of supposedly pure #3 Afghani heroin and nearly jizzed in my pants when the mail arrived. 

I opened the packet up to do some lines but was shocked to find this stuff was sticky as hell, resembling a gum of some sort, so it was impossible to snort  

I wished I had some needles even though I'd never really injected the stuff besides in hospital but I live far from a pharmacy so there was only one way

I wasted 2 points trying to smoke the shit off foil and failed a million times (also shoved a nug up my ass and took some sublingually to no avail)  but finally with my last few spots left, i mastered the art of chasing the dragon and was sent into that bliss I so dearly missed. 

Love, empathy, euphoria, complete contemptness for the entire universe. I have been united with a friend I have yearned for an entire year.

I’ve been on some benzo or another (lorazepam, xanax, klonopin, temazepam, etc.) since I was 18 so I am going to likely need a taper considering I’ve been taking 7-8mg/day roughly, sometimes more, when I’m supposed to be taking 4 max and going down. I hope they give me Valium or something. 

This is my first stint in rehab so my anxiety is through the rough,cravings already terrible, and I’m so fucking restless I want to chop off my legs. The Requip I take for RLS isn’t making a dent whatsoever.

This community has been great, wish you all the best, I’ll go give this a try but ehh we’ll see. Facing the grief and depression is why drugs are so appealing. I’d just rather numb out and escape and hide. Who wants to deal with finding their brother dead on the floor?

I feel like I can do this. I am passing time with weed and the occasional pregabalin. Sometimes Xanax for my insomnia, but besides that, I didn't take any other drugs since then and don't really crave them.

**Tinychat can be VERY shitty about the mobile app so if you can connect with a computer, that is the best option.**  
firstly, this chat is not affiliated with this subreddit or its moderators, and has its own moderators, rules, and etiquette. if you feel someone there has slighted you take it up with the moderators of tinychat, as it is completely unaffiliated with and not endorsed by this or any other subreddit.  
just a reminder and an announcement that a bunch of your fellow degenerate junkies, chippers, and tourists hang out in [our very own tinychat room](http://tinychat.com/ropiatesubchat) which has been an ongoing tradition for something like four years now. the location, for those who can't do links for whatever reason, is http://tinychat.com/ropiatesubchat.  

tinychat is an extremely buggy videochat client, but also the only one that fills its particular niche---that being, anyone who knows the room name may enter, and it has a youtube player. any technical difficulties may be addressed by the moderator, namely me. we like to hang out, listen to music, talk about random shit, and lately have even had our own resident sketch artist who draws random crap upon request. the primary purposes for the room's existence are companionship and harm reduction---it's nice to be able to shoot up with others around, even if you are technically alone in the non-digital sense, and have people keeping an eye on you. we're also glad to help with any problems you might be having, or questions you might need answered. we aim to be a welcoming, friendly space for the members of this subreddit to do what we do in good company without judgement. so stop by if you are bored, or just need to talk.  

if it appears like there is a moderator in the room but who is not speaking, just type a few sentences to summon them back. if you are on mobile it is not immediately apparent that there is anyone in the room. either click the button shaped like an outline of a person (i think) to see the list, or say hello to see if anyone responds.  


rules:  

1. pick a unique username. this is to protect other users so we know who is who, given the nature of the sort of activities we enjoy. 

2. no lurking. again, to protect the other users. if you come in the room be prepared to introduce yourself and participate for at least a few minutes so we know you're not up to any shenanigans. if you are lurking you will be warned and then given a generous ten minutes to announce yourself. if the time runs out, you will be kicked (not banned) until you are ready to come in and actually participate. if you are a known member whose identity can be confirmed, this rule is not applicable.  

3. no -isms or hate speech, even accidental. one warning will be issued, any continued insistence on such behavior will result in a ban. bans can be contested by pm'ing a moderator (me). this includes but is not limited to racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia. for example, if you are not black, use of the n-word, even with the -a ending, will not be tolerated. i don't care if your friend down the block lets you say it, it's not your lane. 

4. no auditory fuckery. due to peculiarities of the transmission of sound over a chat, certain echos and effects can be amplified to the point of being severely distressing. if it is determined that your end is causing an echo you will be asked to use headphones, or to mute your microphone when not speaking. deliberately making strange or unpleasant noises to annoy other chatters will not be tolerated, and your broadcast will be closed. (this only means that your video/audio feed will be terminated--you will still be allowed to type.)  

i know the rules seem like a lot but there's really only four of them, and only two that pertain to just behaving in a manner that isn't dickish.

Tips?,"So this weekend I am trying Buprenorphine. This will be my first opiate use recreationally. I understand that Buprenorphine has different bonding affinities than other opiates, but for someone with no tolerance I should be pretty high. I also understand that this opiate is many more times stronger than morphine. I am going to take like 1-2mg intranasally. I might also add some Vistiril. I am buying an 8mg Suboxone, but after I take the 2mg I'm flushing the rest down the toilet in order to not pursue potential temptations. I am doing this because, I have tried tons of drugs like: LSD, Shrooms, Weed, DPH, Cocaine, DXM, Alcohol, Xanax, etc. I want to try everything in my lifetime, so naturally at least one opiate is on my list. 

I debated this decision for a while. I understand opiates are no game and their power must be treated with respect. As a result, I am surely playing with fire. But I have strong will and don't think I will let this drug take to much of a hold on me. Any tips for doing this safely? I am obviously nervous about this but my mind is made up. I have studied the consequences of opiate use and the neurology behind it for quite some time. I have also read this subreddit for awhile. I feel I am ready if taken responsibly. Any feedback is appreciated. Cheers

Edit: Thanks for the very rapid and supportive comments. I think I will pass on the opiate attempt (for now at least) in exchange for some Molly/MDMA (another I need to add to my resume.) You guys scared me the shit out of me as expected. Sorry if I disappointed people curious about a future update. Also might take people suggestions and wait for a more euphoric opiate such as Oxy's or Hydro's. Gotta make the experience special I guess. Thanks again and I wish you friends the best.

I can almost see you shaking your heads and saying ""But, what about the rush? What about the 100% bio-availability? You are really telling us we should stop IVing our dope?"". Well, yes, in fact I am. Allow me to explain:

Even though IV is the most efficient way to use heroin (it ALL goes directly into the bloodstream) your body simply compensates for this, raising your tolerance. So, within less than a week of shooting dope I was already needing to shoot as much or perhaps even more dope to get off as when I was sniffing. Not only that, but for some reason IV heroin lasts significantly less time than snorted. So you actually spend more money when you IV than when you sniff.

So what reason is there to IV? Well, there is a rush. A feeling of intense pleasure (or just plain intensity sometimes) that lasts about a minute after you slam down that plunger. Naturally, this minute of intense pleasure is highly prized and sought after. It is the best minute of a junkie's day. However, in my case at least, I feel like sometimes the rest of the high can be somewhat of a let down afterward because its never as good as the rush and IV is a LOT more fiendish, kinda like smoking Crack vs snorting Cocaine.

Mine was just being absolutely clumsy as fuck. I was in the midst of a couple months long binge and had been just chucking my discarded foil under a cabinet in my bedroom (still lived with them then). This was already clumsy enough, but it never actually got me caught. 

My girlfriend was over so I was sneaking off to the toilet for a smoke every now and then and finished a slice of foil that I was using. Rather than taking it back with me I just dropped it down the back of the bath. As usual my memory for the better of me and I totally forgot until I received a nice little text saying 'Your mother found some foil behind the bath. have you been smoking heroin?'

My answer was of course I did but not in a long time. That was foiled when I got home to find them sitting in the main room with a coffee table full of used foil, so many good time lain over that table. 

My dad knew exactly what it was used for but encouraged me to tell my mum it was a different painkiller (Oxycontin). 

Since then I've moved out and certainly don't leave any foil about when I'm back visiting!

---""Hey everyone! I recently tried going to a PCP since my relative said that she prescribed him opioids for pain. He has MS and I have a condition called Transverse Myelitis which is rarer and similar to his. She gives him a two month supply which is 150 Oxycodone 10 MG and 150 Hydrocodone 10 MG. I have very bad back and neck pain and I have tried everything except injections which I want to stay away from due to costs mainly ( which I hear is ridiculous ). I go to his doctor and she said she doesn't prescribe Percocet anymore because of the opiod epidemic and she could lose her job. She tried to refer me to Pain Management but I've tried going and it is really expensive. 300$ a visit with insurance. I'm 24 so I'm not sure what to do even if I did go to an appointment since I'm young and everyone is really strict. I have my MRI's and official diagnoses. I did havey neurologist prescribe me 170 10 Mg Percocet every month but it was two years ago ( he shut down his clinic or quit ). I did go a different PCP who was known for not giving narcotics but he still gave me 10 mg OxyContin because he seemed to understand my situation. I have also been to the ER and they don't give narcotics either but the ER doctor still gave it to me and told me to go to Pain Management as well. I have to mention as well I do smoke Marijuana and in Georgia, Marijuana is illegal whether or not you have a medicinal card. I have also been taking Kratom and it is helping a little but I've noticed months of taking it has steadied my tolerance and has even increased it. I don't know what to do next. Does anyone know with the right insurance how much pain management costs would go down? And if it is really my only hope? I've just heard bad stuff on how they're strict and if you fail their drug tests then you're pretty much red flagged by every doctor. I also don't even know if they will dose me based on my pain level since of my age and height (I'm short). Sorry for rambling, but at this point I'm not sure what to do. I can't even keep a job (lost three jobs) because of the pain I'm in and due to the transverse Myelitis I already have to deal with my nonexistent feeling in parts of my body along with my uncontrollable bladder ( which I have to wear a diaper for ) and I have this pain. Does anyone know what should I do? Sorry for rambling, even if no one replies at least I was able to take out my frustrations via text. Anyways thanks to anyone who can help!""",1511888822.0

I find it fucking ridiculous that the law would discourage people from phoning in OD's out of fear of arrest. I also think it's a shitty thing to do to leave someone OD'ing because you're scared, but can understand that fear makes you do stupid things. Still, the law should be encouraging legitimate OD calls, especially considering the Opiod crisis in its current state. For that reason I wanted to show readers here this [Link](http://www.ncsl.org/research/civil-and-criminal-justice/drug-overdose-immunity-good-samaritan-laws.aspx) (it's NCSL, which as I understand it, is a pretty trustworthy site) so if one day you find yourself in this situation, you at least know the law. 

As a foreigner, I don't want to try to tell you how your laws work. I just thought this would be helpful, and if it's something that might help a guy in trouble, I thought it was worth sharing. I hope one day every state will have this enforced. Have a good day anyways, almost the weekend.",1512055799.0

I've been on methadone since January but a majority of the time since then I IV'd at least 8mg dilaudid a day because I have some chronic pain. My methadone Doctor knows this and is okay with this and has been working with my pain and considering prescribing me something so I don't use, and he's told me since im used to IV he would probably up my methadone (from 40mg) while I started getting used to not IVing and also giving me higher than a normal starting dose and seeing if I can go oral that way. Im 100% okay with that. 

Anyways, in my time IVing I've used quite a few veins. There was one I found about two months ago that had a great blood flow and made the hits feel great and it was so easy to get to. Now, I had a few boils in this vein (I get them a lot, like most of the time ever since I had abscesses last summer. I've made them go away for a couple months but they did come back) the boils have healed, and theres a bit of scar tissue. However most of the time I try to hit this vein I still succeed and get that nice rush of blood into my needle. But sometimes I don't, but Im in the general area where it is. So about two weeks ago I thought I'd try anyway, and I was in. I actually ended up drawing in the blood about halfway through the shot that first time so I knew for sure I was in the vein. I've done it a few times since and I draw no blood, but Im DEFINITELY in the vein. It doesn't feel like a miss, I get the rush I do when im in any other vein, there's no swelling, there's just no reason to think it was a missed shot. This has been done with the d8's and heroin. Has anyone experienced this before? Something like it? Im so confused by it. My assumption is that there's a lot of scar tissue preventing me from drawing blood, because I do bleed afterwards and like I said it feels exactly like a shot that isn't missed and right in the vein.

How does it affect your experience with opiates? And anything else you can think of feel free to add. 

Also does anyone know where I can find any scientific evidence papers will studies in regards to the combination?
Thank you for your input & help. This would be in regard to either smoking tobacco or vaporizing it in eliquid/juice form.

I don't smoke cigarettes & have never really enjoyed them unless really really stressed out and I have nothing else which is rare but there is one exception where I can tolerate them which is on opiates for some reason. 
Even then I only will smoke a cigarette if I don't have my vaporizer sub ohm pen. It's not a huge box one as it's not practical but it gives nice hits/clouds about the size that a hookah or shisha would but of course much smoother. 

I know from my experience I enjoy my vaporizer pen with menthol e-juice (the only juice I like & only one I can find with natural flavors like Menthol crystals. 

Of course though that propelyn (sp?) glycol & vegetable glycerin (50:50 ratio in my ejuice. 6mg nicotine which is low compared to what a heavy smoker how would you use if they converted to eJuice. Which could be anywhere from 12-20mg.) are not hundred percent natural lol & I wouldn't be surprised that there's negative physical effects but still healthier than a cigarette and still preferred by myself if I had to pick one after a shot of hydromorphone or morphine. 

I do wonder though if it being a CNS stimulant it could maybe sober you up in some aspects. Possibly idk. 
Which is why I'm intrested in studies or any science proving if this is true or not. I do find it takes away some of the downer which in most cases isn't great as you want to maintain your high. But it's also more enjoyable. Alot more than usual. Usually I only have a fraction of the ejuice I have on a regular day aka 10-15 hits. 

Anyway that's my experience what's yours?

I also say I would be interested in anyone who has info regarding science that relates the two substances together (articles, studies, videos, books etc.).

I also hope I didn't misspell heroin.,"Like so many of the greatest stories ever told, this one also begins with a dirty microwave.  The pitiful machine watched me like a terrified child from the corner.  I paced in the dark.  It was not long before I got crazy and stuffed her into a roll around suitcase to collect her ransom from some villains I knew.  The kidnapping was going well, until I got a greedy itch on the way to make the exchange and robbed the Scholtzky’s in the parking lot of my apartment complex.  It was 50 feet from my front door.  The manager and cashiers knew us by name.  My accomplice was an old, crippled man on crutches, and the suitcase had my all of my personal information on it when we got arrested.  It wasn’t my best day, but then again it wasn’t my worst.  Let me tell you what happened.

----------------------------------------------------



I detoxed in the back room of Cheo’s house.  It was sweaty and miserable and sleepless.  A slight pocking had started in California, but now it was taking a turn for the worst.  I swore it was a curse the witch I beat up in California put on me.  The rash itched and robbed me of sleep. It tortured me. It broke my already feeble mind. My legs and ankles visibly swelled, and three different doctors had no answer. What I determined to be a secondary staph infection created crusty lesions on my thighs that broke and wept when I lifted anything heavy. A round of sulfa based antibiotics gave me some relief, but even if the rash wasn’t there to plague my life, there were other things breaking me inside.

The abrupt discontinuation of my daily heroin regimen made me feel everything my body was doing. My bones’ hard surfaces cut into my aching muscles, pulling and twisting every ligament. Instead of a spine with vertebra, I had a stack of wooden Jenga blocks ready to fall. My guts gurgled when I swallowed my saliva. I imagined my brain’s synaptic firings discharged heat through my ears and caused a dull aching in my eyeballs. It was as if life had become an electrically charged fence into which I was slowly being pushed. 

My feet shuffled across the floor in the daytime. Articles of clothing I collected from the streets covered Cheo’s back room in truly psychotic fashion. I spilled rolling tobacco all over his house and crept around the kitchen at night. His cupboard’s hinges creaked while his family slept. I got solidified chunks from an ancient can of ensure stuck between my teeth and gagged. It was my fault for compulsively looting his dry goods cabinet and eating whatever I found in the dark. 

I reeled from the horrors I lived on the streets of California. Cheo’s wife would talk to me about this or that while she cooked dinner, but it always ended up with her assuring me I was okay.  She promised I would recover. It was like flipping through a book I knew so well, but evil was written where there had been good. Blank pages existed where maps of myself had once been drawn, and termites had turned the remaining pieces of parchment into confetti. 

I held my head in my hands. 

Who was I? What had I done? Something was wrong and worse than ever. I did not cry, but I probably should have. These were the pains of metamorphosis, which I never could feel on the drugs, but when I was sober, the screams of my own mutilated conscience echoed inside of my skull. 

I thought about my father and the things I did to hurt him. I thought about my mother and how she threw herself on the bed and cried when I got arrested at the house. I thought about the failures with my girlfriend and how disgusting I was. I registered for school and moved into the Warren Inn in the city.

My back felt straighter with the prospect of a new life in a new environment.  It was a fresh start.  Sleep was possible.  Pieces of my mind were coming back.  I was clean.  The itchy rash was going away.  Spring semester started, and I had a little girlfriend, so things were looking up.

The girl liked me even though, I had given her a Valentine’s Day card with another girl’s name scratched out and hers scribbled beneath it.  It was hand drawn, and I managed to rhyme violet with toilet in the poem I wrote on the inside. 

I told her she was beautiful.  She looked at the scars on my legs in bed.  We ate her birthday dinner at a Mexican restaurant with her family a few days after that, and her grandmother laughed at everything I said. 

“You’re a very interesting man!”  Her grandmother said.  

She seemed to think I was good for her granddaughter, but I smoked cigarettes.  I lay on a bare mattress in the dark.  I watched reruns of Roseanne till four every morning.  I wanted to burn my life down and would as soon as I got the chance.  Our relationship ended as soon as I found out that my next-door neighbor could score heroin and cocaine.  

My dad came to visit one weekend in late February, and it was a Saturday night when I told my dad I was going to see the girl.  It would be a good excuse to ask for 20 bucks and give me an opportunity to try scoring at the mall.  When I couldn’t find anything, I walked back to the Warren Inn to see if my neighbor could help me out.  I had only seen him once, but he seemed like a drug addict.  

He opened the door a few seconds after I knocked and told me his name was Tracy.  A man named Larry with big hair and leather cowboy boots had a knee brace and crutches and sat in the corner next to an empty spoon like a proud Hispanic rooster.  I spoke low so my dad wouldn’t hear me through the wall.

“Can you get anything?”

“You’re not a cop are you?  Whatever I get you, you have to do in front of me, so I know you’re not a cop.”

“Yeah.  That’s no problem.  I sort of need to do it here.  My dad’s in my room.”

In ten minutes, he took my 20 bucks out to the parking lot and came right back.  He dropped a black chunk in a small baggie on the nightstand next to my chair for me to see under the light.  It was exciting to know that my neighbor had a solid hook up for heroin and cocaine as Tracy handed me a spoon.  I cooked it up and pulled the brown liquid through the tiny cotton filter and into my syringe.

I had not shot up heroin since I left California, and the stint of abstinence made for a dramatic effect of the drug.  It was the same as before, only more intense.  My blood got warm and my stomach got queasy.  The constriction of my pupils, blood vessels and lungs felt like an elephant stepped on my back.  Breath became shallow.  Words creaked out of me like bullfrog croaks and fell onto my chest.  My eyelids hung heavy and swollen.  My nose itched, and I got the hiccups before I puked in his garbage can.  He told me to come back in the morning if I wanted more.

My dad took off that next morning like he had planned.  It was not the best visit.  Sure, I was off the streets, but when he showed up he had to take me to buy sheets for my bed.  My clothes, room, hair and life in general were more disheveled than he liked to see.  I spent 20 dollars he gave me on a haircut, but it looked the same when I came back.  He got mad and made me get another one.      

Before he left he hunched over in the wind and counted out 200 dollars for me in the parking lot outside of my building.  He bit his tongue, because it didn’t look like anything was going to change with me even if he thought I was sober for the moment.  

My life unraveled.  

Within a week something like 300 unopened condoms littered the whole room with heroin cookers, rubber tourniquets, baggies of cotton balls and alcohol swabs from the needle exchange.  Trash littered the floors, and a film of cigarette tar and ashes covered the windows and mirrors.  Feces piled high out of the toilet that had quit working weeks before.  I systematically broke into every car in the parking lot one night and kept the useless loot.  There was one half of a 20-dollar bill, three small bags of dirt weed, several briefcases full of what appeared to be dried out potting soil (if that can even be believed), a broken ironing board, and manila folders full of someone else’s old resumes, among other things.  It was all on the floor in my room that stunk and stayed dark like me.

The Warren Inn was full of sad people living sad lives who barely survived on food stamps and the crumbs they had left for the month after paying rent with their SSI.  That’s why the cars had nothing good to steal.  A crazy guy invited me into his room on the second floor of my building and read from a notebook some things he had written.  There were jars of urine and feces in the corner and an eerie desire to get out of there as soon as I could.  

A middle-aged woman with bad skin lived across the hall from me with her boyfriend.  He had a withered hand and a limp.  They got into a fight one day, and she tore off in his van.  He chased her.  I ran into their room and stole a pair of boots, a jacket, a sleeve of generic Chips Ahoy and a sleeve of saltines.  Later that night, I tried to dine and dash at the IHOP but gorged myself on French toast so badly, I couldn’t run.  The next morning, I shot up a syringe full of cocaine and Tracy’s blood even after he told me had Hepatitis C.

My life continued to unravel.  

Another man lived in the building next to mine. I supposed he was a man, but there were things about him, like his breath and the texture of his skin, that made me wonder if maybe he wasn’t a clump of yeast and dough somehow become sentient. His motor skills and the air of his sophistication were on par with most three-year old kids I knew, and his dress only added to it: an old bomber jacket, cowboy boots, ear muffs and a pair of ski goggles to ride the bus. His only teeth stuck out his bottom gums, like two pieces of corn. 

I told him about surviving Katrina. He told me of younger days in a biker gang and presently bulging hernias. Gnarled fingers grew out of his knotted hands like the branches of an old cypress tree, attached to frozen wrists where the bones had fused together. 

“I’ve got rubatide arthritis. Had it for ten years, now.” His pronunciation of the ailment incited serious questions in my mind. How could someone live with such inconvenience? How did he deal with the pain? How did he have a disease for ten years and not know how it was pronounced?

He got me a spot selling newspapers, because the regular guy was sick.  A van picked us up in the morning and dropped us off at our respective locations.  It seemed to be more about putting a few quarters in the pockets of these decrepit liquor hounds, than it did about actually making money.  The novelty of notably destitute newspaper vendors on the same street corners every morning must have somehow been good for the press.  I just couldn’t figure out how. 
 
My hands went numb, and everyone who bought a newspaper asked where Ray was.  Some people just asked where he was but didn’t buy one.  It took over four hours to collect seven singles and 13 dollars more in quarters.  When I did, I abandoned my post and walked to Taco Bell.  A guy tried to sell me a package of stolen razor blade heads at one of the tables but settled to rip me off by a canal on the other side of a chain linked fence.  He wouldn’t shut up about shooting up in the back of his hands.  I should have known not to trust him.  


Larry moved into my room, and whatever pomp he projected that first night in Tracy’s apartment had withered with his frame.  Now he stood on his crutches and stared into the bathroom mirror, shooting thick mixtures of cocaine and heroin into his neck.  His once beautifully conditioned and manicured hair had turned into a matted ball of lint exaggerated by his skeletal frame and highlighted by the purple track marks running down his jugular veins.  There were stragglers from up and down the road, who came in and out of my room day and night.  A 24-year-old guy we called Popeye stopped by frequently and bragged about kicking in doors and raping women.

Popeye imagined booty lay on the other side of every window and door he saw, and nights he came around saw me trying to climb up the sides of buildings and into windows impossible to reach.    He jumped over the counter at Schlotzky’s and took a 20 out of the drawer one day and got away with it.  Popeye called me guero and liked to say I was stepping on his toes.


One night I stole seven Ativan out of the bottle in Larry’s coat pocket while he slept in a pile of trash in the corner.  It had been a hard night for me as I was sick and mostly unable to sleep from a lack of heroin.  He sat up and patted his chest to feel for the bottles when he woke up at around 10 and pulled the bottles out.  11 pills had turned into four while he slept.  He looked at me.  I said, 
“I’m sorry!”

I made empty promises to repay him, but when he demanded proof, I ripped the microwave out of the wall and stuffed it into the red roll around suitcase.  It still had a laminated card from my grandmother’s travel agency and my own information from flying on it.

“Call Luna!  Tell him to bring a dub!”

“What?  You think he is going to want that nasty, little thing?  You’ve lost it.”

“Just call him!  I’ll deal with him when he gets here!”

Larry called him, and I could tell Luna was trying to confirm that we had money over the phone, but Larry danced around it until Luna agreed to come anyway.  I slid my arms into the sleeves of my NASCAR racing jacket and headed across the parking lot with Larry hobbling on crutches.  It was a number 24, Jeff Gordon racing jacket, bright red with blue flames up the sleeves and a bright blue DUPONT logo on the front.  My mom had ordered it for me brand new, to replace the old dirty one she made me throw away in California.  Larry’s crutches creaked in the cold across the asphalt.  The suitcase rolled behind me and half of the microwave stuck out.  The power chord dragged behind.

It had all unraveled.  


As if the bright red racing jacket and microwave in my suitcase and the raggedy old man on crutches didn’t attract enough attention or make us easy to identify, the whole crew of that Schlotzky’s knew us by name.  They always let us wait for Luna in the store out of the cold and even gave us free drinks from the soda fountain.

The manager smiled at us and asked us how we were doing and walked back to the drive-up window.  It was not likely that Luna would accept the microwave and not likely that he would give us a ride to hock it for the measly five bucks it would fetch.  I jumped over the counter to hit the cash out button.  The drawer opened, and I took a couple 20-dollar bills.  An employee screamed at me.  

I handed Larry a 20 and ran through the parking lot behind the Warren Inn.  Somehow, I knew to get rid of my red jacket and went to my room from the other side of the building to change my clothes.  The sunglasses, headphones, blue Dickies jacket and backwards Kangol cap were enough of a change that when the cops came into the building to look for me, they asked me if I had seen myself running by in a red jacket.

“No, officer, I haven’t seen him.” I tried to walk down the road but it was too cold.

I walked to the other building and knocked on the yeast ball’s door.  A few days before this I sold him 20 dollars of laundry detergent and watched him put it in his arm while I did the coke he bought.  He knew I ripped him off, but there was nowhere else to go now.  The cops were coming.  I knocked again, but there was no response.

When I finally walked back to the room to meet the cops in the hallway, they smashed my face into the wall and handcuffed me.  They already had Larry in the back of a squad car with his crutches and the 20 that I gave him.  The cops told me they would let me go with a ticket if I could give them back the other 20, but Larry had warrants and was going to jail either way.  As bold as it was to jump over the counter and help myself to the money in the cash box, the cops only charged me petty larceny.

Sitting there in handcuffs, I wasn’t embarrassed by gawking onlookers or the slowing traffic.  At 19 that was who I was, a criminal junkie, and that is what criminal junkies did.  They got arrested at 10:30 on a Tuesday morning for being embarrassingly inept at crime and the whole world saw it.  The officers talked amongst themselves and said that they wouldn’t go into the room to look for the other 20 because of the filth and stench.

Larry and I spent three days in jail and went to court on Friday.  I took my charges and told the judge I had only come for school.  It was a mystery to me how I ended up jumping over the counter at a restaurant and taking money out of the register.  He let me go with time served.  Cheo picked me up a week later and took me back to his hometown to clean up.

I love this sub, I love the support people have here for one another, and the positive reinforcement to beat this demon we’re all facing. It’s because of that that I’m thinking about sharing my story through Instagram posts. I’m not doing it for notoriety,  I want to do it because I feel like most social media accounts are pretty much bullshit selfies and cliche pictures/posts, so I want to make one of substance, one that will show my progress from addiction to sobriety. I think it will also hold me accountable and not want to let those people that are following my progression down. I mainly want to do it to inspire. I believe I was put through this hell to overcome it and share my story to hopefully help others going thru addiction so that they might overcome it as well. I wanted to share it here first because I love this space where everyone is free of judgement, so let me know if you all think this is a good idea/will follow and help me thru this journey. I know I can get through it and I want to help others as well. Maybe it’ll even shed light on how the world views addicts and addiction as a whole. Love you all and thanks for any advice/comments ... 

I just created it. I’m going to do it, I think vulnerability and honesty will be refreshing and will motivate me to continue to do it. The more views and follows I get will just be more inspiration so I’m asking for your upvotes and follows; if this helps even one more person with their struggle then it’s worth it.

I think it will be cool for people to see what I look like as well. I feel like I’m not your average user. It’ll just show that addiction has no face.

I wanted to get rid of them somehow but I wasnt able to and over the course of november I ended up eating all of them. Yesterday I took the last 4mg I had left. Now im thinking of waiting a few days to detox the subs out of my system and when the wds kick in again going back to kratom. Really pissed that just because of going to the hospital my opiate/kratom addiction is now gonna be a lot worse since I just took subs for over a month straight...god dammit...also im worried because I have never tried going from subs to kratom before and I hope the kratom is effective when I do take it.

I just enjoyed this sub like always and a question popped up: I donˋt enjoy opiates not the least. Once I took 80mg Oxy for start and 160mg over the course of 18 hours (no tolerance). The only effect was violent vomiting the day after. Foolishly I even tried Heroin to at least know what makes the opiate high so „desirable“. Before anyone says „quit while itˋs like that“ or wants to give advice on what might work instead: Opiates (like dissociatives) are off my list. Camping next to a toilet for a day is not worth it.

Now to my actual question: If you could choose, would you prefer to be „immune“ to opioids or keep it like itˋs supposed to be - excluding the analgesic effects, just the „recreational high“.

Of course this is no judgement in any way, but even if you‘re not using - would you miss to even have the option?

Hope this makes any sense, I sill enjoy LSD :)

I'm only on my 5th day but feeling a lot better then 2 days ago. Christ, that was brutal. I want to quit this time. I have a pretty nasty abscess on my arm that I've been taking antibiotics for. That I hope work. I'm out of money, friends, health...im going to be evicted any day now. I have collectors calling me nonstop. I haven't been to work in a month due to ""health problems"". So why not quit now? What I've noticed is that it just keeps getting worse. So do I need my bottom to be homeless and jobless on the streets before I give it up? I mean, what the fuck am I even holding onto so hard? It doesn't give me a rush anymore, my tolerance quickly goes through the roof. I'm spending every dine I have plus some on this shit. I owe my dealer a grand. Lol, I'm so fucked. But I can either keep making it worse or start making it better....so I'm going to make it better this time. Wish me luck guys. I want to be well.

**Edit:** Holy shit, thanks for all the well wishes guys. This sub is amazing. I may be checking into rehab tonight so I'll probably be radio silent for a few weeks but it's a good move.

Honestly my life was alright before drugs, I've always struggled with depression/anxiety but in the past I've had enough friends and hobbies to keep me on my feet. I occasionally smoked weed back in the day because I had a lot of stoner friends, and inevitably, I got into it myself. Smoked every day for a while, until I had a realisation that it has made me socially inept, a hermit and a boring loser. I quit, expecting things to improve if I put the work in, but its like 7 months later now and my life just... sucks

I just can't really make friends anymore, I mean some days are good and I can feel normal, but in general I just stopped really doing things. When I'm home now, I usually just watch youtube all day and feel empty... and do heroin, but we'll get onto that. Being so lonely and bored all the time, I started popping oxys, I overdosed on xanax too. Eventually I just got onto heroin, and here I am now. I'm lost in life, I go to school, I don't really know what to do with my life and I'm going to fail everything. It's really sad because I used to have *so* much potential, I was actually really special, and it ALL went to waste. Some people you just look at as a kid and presume they'll  go on to do great things, but I screwed up and fell upon a torturous path of self-destruction. I honestly just want to die, not like kill myself, but just get a heart attack or sniped in the head. I want to be put down, I just can't see my life going anywhere but downwards.

I know there are numerous posts about identifying fakes, but these do not have a lot of the characteristics of what a lot of the frauds look like. That said, they do have some strange qualities that are concerning  (I think).

The photos here are shit, I apologize. My phone camera is horrible. They also do not show the proper color, or at least they look quite different in the pics than what they do in person. In person, they are a fairly light blue, not turquoise or teal. As someone who has had these prescribed in the past, they look pretty much like anything I'd ever gotten, color-wise. It's by far the most convincing aspect to my eyes. That said, I do have some questions and was hoping you guys could help me figure this all out.

-The tab has little specks of a deeper blue, and these specks are also present within. Is this normal? I don't recall ever seeing this, but don't honestly remember ever looking.

-One of these tabs does seem to be a little offcenter with regards to the 'M', but I think I remember some imperfections on the imprint with even legit prescriptions. Am I wrong, or do they always have perfect alignment?

Lastly, can anyone tell me if the front side and the back side should be aligned in any particular fashion? For instance, the M on the front isn't always uniform to the back imprint. The top of the M on one side will be under the bar with the 30 on the back on a few, but others are perpendicular. Should these be aligned a certain way or are they randomly printed?

As for effect, they seem to feel like an opiate. They taste kinda bitterand burn slightly but no more than any other I have ever insufflated. They also take a little bit of effort to crush, and are somewhat grainy. Certainly not powdery. I seem to remember the legit ones breaking up much easier than other brands out there. They are not glossy either, but I think that's normal. They weren't stored properly, so I also  kinda expected them to be somewhat rough from the humidity.

Anyway, I really appreciate the responses, and I will delete this post as soon as I get some better idea. If this is not allowed here, any advice would be appreciated as to where I can ask. I am mostly just trying to avoid harm to myself before continuing with using them. Thanks guys!

How crazy is that? Do you think us junkies would get downvoted into oblivion? Also, in that society, truth is voted on. Whatever gets the most votes, wins.

I mostly feel sedated, relaxed, nothing intense like I was expecting but it's super nice.

I've snorted a about half a bag so far, over a 7 hour period. I've been nodding off asleep a lot and felt really good. I fell half-asleep (eyes closed listening to music but like a little bit awake) for a good 4 hours of that period.

I'm really just worried because I don't know how much is too much. I want to do a little bit more but how would I know when a good time to stop is? I haven't been having any nausea (although I have been smoking pot so that probably helps) but I just tried to eat and it made me very nauseated.

Edit: I also have zero tolerance. How fast can I expect tolerance to build? If I try to keep it to like just once a week (good luck to me) will my tolerance reset each time?

2nd edit: When I was asking how much is too much I meant to ask is there any way I can tell if I'm getting close to an OD or anything? I'm just sniffing it

Edit 3 Please read: I just threw up what I tried to eat earlier after sniffing a bit more. I feel fine otherwise but is that normal? I still have decent control of my motor functions",1512091752.0

I’ve got a huge amount of paperwork that I need to complete ASAP otherwise I’ll be a lot trouble.

All this added up to me because my in a really shit place by the time I headed home. 

I’ve been a little reckless with my opiate use recently. Having successfully on and off for a long time I’ve been using more days then not. Never huge doses but far too regular. And I’ve had a couple of scares where I’ve nodded off super hard. The last of which was a couple of days ago and I woke up face down in a pillow. I use alone so I’m usually really careful about dose size and only doing half a shot and waiting to see how it hits but yeah it’s still too easy to make a mistake.  

Anyway I decided duck it, and drew myself up a shot. It wasn’t the biggest, I didn’t and don’t feel high. I just feel ok. The slight sore throat I had, can’t feel it. All the shit going on in my life...it’s fine, I’ll deal with it. It’s amazing and it feels like a cheat to resolving all the fucked ways my mind decides to act and make me feel. It’s so dangerous though. I know it is. I’m just really leaving future me in more shit then I am already. I’m just isolating and hiding from it all. I’m just as trapped as I ever was.

Just kind of trying to get my thoughts out here. I've been a pretty heavy H user for the past year, recently got clean about two months ago. My boyfriend and I used last night because we had a long week and thought we'd treat ourselves. We're sniffers, and knew our tolerance was pretty much gone so we were going to be careful... right.

Admittedly, I did my line and thought to myself, hmm that seemed a bit too big. But I was ready to feel that sweet relief again, so I pushed that worry to the back of my mind as that warm feeling started to creep up my body. My boyfriend tells me he's going to the bathroom. I'm feeling good, I lay down on the bed and close my eyes...

Next thing I know, he's standing over me, as I'm laying on the floor, dragging me to my feet and sobbing, telling me to get up. I groggily follow him to the bathroom and he sets me in the bathtub and starts running cold water on me. Through shakey breaths he tells me I overdosed. I start crying, telling him I don't want to die as reality starts to set in. 

Apparently I passed out while he was in the bathroom. He came back and saw me curled up in bed, and thought I was just relaxing after a long day at work. He told me to wake up and tried to play with my hair. No response. He said my name a little louder. Still no response. He noticed then I was breathing very lightly, in shallow wheezes. My boyfriend thankfully knew something was wrong instantly, and carried me to the kitchen and laid me on the floor. He said he tried getting me to wake up by lightly slapping my face and rubbing my sternum. At that point he realized I wasn't breathing at all and my lips were turning blue. He then began giving me mouth to mouth breathing and checking my pupils. 

The scariest part he said was looking at my eyes and seeing how lifeless they looked. Like he could literally see the light fading from them. At the point, he decided to administer chest compressions while dialing 911. Thankfully, before he hit dial, I finally gasped myself into consciousness, which is all that I remember.

I am rattled by what happened. I legitimately do not remember anything that happened after I laid down. And to think that I wouldn't be here right now had he taken just a little longer in the bathroom has truly frightened me. I didn't have a point to this story, I just needed to talk it out.

Extremely invasive, nerves were cut, disks removed, spinal fusion, steel rods. The whole deal. 

A year later, massive infection. All over my back, rib cage and even in my bones. Rods got taken out because they were no longer needed and had to clear out the infection anyway, so they just took em out. 

Fast forward to today, I have frequent nerve pain in my hips, constant moderate discomfort unless I’m sitting up against something, my back hurts after so much as vacuuming, doing dishes (leaning over the sink) or walking for more than about 10 minutes straight. The other day I was walking to my car from a football game and I almost couldn’t make it. Sitting in the bleachers during the game was incredibly uncomfortable.

Some days are pretty terrible. I try stretching and doing what I can but nothing really helps for more than an hour or two. I’m a law student right now so I can’t fuck around with pain like this and I don’t want to let it get in the way of my future.

I’ve got an appointment coming up with the surgeon who performed the original operation. I want to get a script for something stronger than Tylenol or whatever. I’ve got limited knowledge of opiates but, my mother, 2 time cancer survivor, has given me some of her stuff from time to time to help my pain and it has worked.

Do you know anyone who overdosed after missing a Vivitrol injection or going off Vivitrol? As in, their tolerance was super low and that was a factor? 

I would especially be interested in hearing about cases in which the person was ordered to use Vivitrol by a drug court.

He always thought this was charming and funny, luckily, and a big smile would crack as he went to get it for me from the spot where they had to be hidden from me.

SHARE your experience!,"I'm early into my recovery from 5 years of heroin addiction. About a month ago, my life came utterly crashing down. I won't really go into specifics but you can read my post history if you would like to know more. I basically lost my job, apartment, girlfriend, and car in the span of a week due to my heroin use. My father also just died while holding my hand, fighting for his life, just the other night. I'm going through a lot right now, but despite my shitty life I'm still about 3 weeks clean from heroin. 

.      .My doctor and family both have been pressuring me to receive a vivitrol injection as soon as possible. I am very hesitant not because I want to use, but because of the whole idea of blocking my opiate receptors. It would only make sense that the blocking mechanism would also effect things like runners/weightlifting highs, the euphoric effects that music brings me, and maybe even food and sex. Call me crazy, but I feel like Vivitrol would effect my overall mood and I would lose sense of who I really am. I'm a paranoid person and I feel as if Vivitrol would cause me to blame every negative emotion I'll have on the shot. How would I ever be able to accurately identify if I'm experiencing side effects from vivitrol, or is it PAWs that's causing these potential issues? Can anyone relate? Am I making sense here?

forgot my old login and was more of a lurker anyhow soooo new acct, old junkie me haha :'D

I'm gonna go to mexico over nye after an ibogaine treatment (2nd round). Unforunately while the first one helped, I relapsed after 2 mo. clean. It changed a lot of my attitude tho, I'm not on MMT anymore and actually have goals n shit.

 Now, I have friends over the pond in Mexico where I will go after xmas to smooth over the transition into normal life. A biggie that lead me to using here is that I have almost no clean friends leftt and Germany is socially as cold as the weather, although we have a geat welfare system. To get back into life, I planned a trip to mexico until spring.

My friends there use, no H tho. H is a no-go, Pills & coke are fine tho. I know its hypocrytical but for me its good, as I need them to score anything worthwile without getting into situations I dont wanna be in. I have a job lined up over there even tho Im not even done with Uni over here. And good friends that would rather slap my WDing ass instead of getting me H

Now I know I will use there. Altho its gonna be pharms, coke and weed, for me I will use as it is vacation. I just want to get rid of the addiction. Maybe that mindset will change but atm thats how I see it. Ill take Ibo in 2 weeks, doing H until then, so Ill be physically set once I arrive. Some Questions:

How is it with the legality of pharms thereP My friends say its noi prob to get benzos & tramadol. I really wanna try Opana at least once in my life. Is it smarter to go the DNM route or will it be avavible via local sources?

Same w/ oxy, Dillies, hydrocodone. I really DONT wanna do H there, as thats my DOC. I know, its all the same, but honestly for me and esp my friends there its a red line I dont wanna cross. I love that country and would hate to fuck it up for me addiction-wise. Also, I dont wanna deal w alll the shady drug war shit. Im from Germany, our dope is shit but its all rather safe. I prefer not to get shot or mugged in an alleyway.

Rigs: I can get rly good coke there, my friends dont shoot and I prefer them not seeing me shoot up, but I wanna try that good yay IV if Im there at least once. Are they avavible?

If not -  can so. maybe send me a care package w/ rigs n supply stuff ( NO DOPE), I'll paypal you the cost.

Is Narcan avavible? Esp w the strong pillls and seeing that some of our crew are opiate naive and some arnt, I wanna be prepared. I wont turn guys on that shit, not my style, but I know that if some of us do oxy, Opana or god forbid H, some will folllow. I dont want any dead friends. If not -  same as above - can so. from the US maybe help me out?

Also, general Mexico thread: What should I look out for, any tips (not just drug related)? Any stories?

So my question is based on what i used to take, how much morphine and codeine should i plug ? Also when i take codeine i do a cold water extraction so there is a lot of water, it's going to be hard to plug right ? maybe i should plug the morphine and then just drink the codeine after i plugged the morphine ? but then i'm scared that it might not kick in at the same time .. And also a last question, do i have to plug it all at once ? because when i crush my morphine pills it seems pretty hard for me to get all the powder in only 1 syringe, i'm almost 100% sure that there will still be some powder left in it so i wonder if i can do 2 plugs or something in order to get all the powder in my ass and not waste some",1512219372.0

I’m between chips for the time being and reading and writing posts keeps me sane. For whatever help or interest it may be here’s the methadone chapter of my life story haha:

I was pretty naive when I started. I could find pills whenever I wanted back then but my habit had outgrown my budget and I just wanted to be free of the daily grind of hunting and waiting for my feel-good shit. At the peak of my using then I was taking 8-10 hydros a day (this was before oxy became so available).  

I was 26 then and in hindsight could have detoxed myself rather easily but the allure of a daily dose for $11 + gas money was too seductive. I had never even tried it before I walked into the clinic with a using friend of mine for my intake and first dose. I’ll never forget the look on my buddy’s face after about 5 minutes down the road from the clinic we turned to each other with the biggest holy shit-eating grins! We felt like we had hit the lottery. 

Twenty minutes later I’m at home on the couch nodding harder than I had ever experienced until that time. The clinic had started me off at 25 mg and in hindsight it was probably too high for someone with a hydrocodone addiction and it took a couple of weeks messing with my dose before I hit that sweet spot of high enough not to be almost completely sedated for most of my waking hours. I kinda wanted to be lucid enough to hold down a job lol. It was the most powerful opiate I had ever used and it would be 15 years before I would ever touch a pain pill again.

Fast forward through ten years of methadone maintenance treatment which included a move in the middle to the Pacific Northwest and transferring to a new clinic and all that entails and then back home still on the done. 

Through all those years I had got my dose as high as 60 mg per day down to 6 mg per day. At the end, I was back around where I started at 30 mg but not taking all of my take-home doses. I was getting a two weeks supply by this time and trading the leftovers for weed or cash as needed. I got called in for a bottle check and lost my take-home privileges. I had no drivers license at that time and no way of making the 70 mile round trip for daily doses. I found a local doctor prescribing suboxone and stayed on that for another four years but that’s another chapter and I’ve rambled on enough.

I guess the whole point of the story is that I will feed my addiction however I can based on whatever circumstances I’m faced with and at the same time strive daily to have as much of a normal life as possible. Balancing those two often conflicting things has been the struggle of my life so far and its daily, high or not high.

I'm not an opioid user, but I used to lurk here after dating one a while back. I've run into a dilemma, and y'all seemed like the people to ask.

I have endometriosis, which causes very severe monthly pain. I managed to book a long flight for a bad pain day this month. Seeing as the flight is in a week and my pain has only recently gotten much worse, I don't have many options as far as getting doctor appointments, medications (birth control would work but takes too long to kick in), etc. 

I have Percocet lying around from a dental surgery, and I'm considering taking it during the flight. The only time I've taken it before, I got horrifically nauseated. So, here are my questions:

1) Is there any reason this might be a bad idea?

2) Is there any way I can avoid or mitigate the nausea? I'll probably be vomiting from the endo anyway. Don't want to make it worse. 

3) Someone told me opioids don't take away pain; they just make you not care about it. Is that true? I don't think I want to take the amount of any drug it would take to make me not care about this pain. It can get to a 9/10--nearly delirious, lying on the floor unable to move, etc. 

Edit: Also, how much would be appropriate for an opioid-naive person with severe pain who wants to be as mentally alert as possible?",1512195436.0

First time ever using.,"For some reason I thought my mom wasn't going to let the doctor give me a perscription for pain meds to use after he yanked all my wisdom teeth out so I looked around and found a friend that had a perscription.

Well I buy 8 off him and he says, ""there 5mg each and 3 puts me on my ass so don't take more than that at once I don't want you getting hurt""

I'd already read some posts about hydros and how people said they didn't really feel great until 20-25mg with no tolerance.

Well I have never taken hydros, except one time where I mixed 1 pill with a xan and a lot of coke but that was a long tome ago and a story for another time. What I'm trying to say is I had no tolerance going into this.

Since he said they were 5mg and most people don't feel really good until 20-25mg I'll take 6 so I'm at 30mg and will feel more than what they're describing as an awesome experience. A lot of people were saying they throw up around these doses or get naesuas but that's never really been a problem for me and I've never thrown up on any drug save alcohol.

Well I took them at 10:34pm, roughly 12 hours till I had to be at the oral surgeon for my wisdom teeth removal. By 4 am I was still unable to sleep, I was slightly itchy all over but as the night wore on the itching was more in my legs. I felt like I had no worries and a really cozy feeling like I was sitting right in front of a fireplace. 

9 am rolls around and I try getting out of bed only to find it's difficult to walk. Odd. Hydro high only lasts like 4-6 hours I thought I read. Look in the mirror and pupils are non existent. Don't get me wrong I've had this effect before when I first found fent ( i only did fent a handful of times)

Get so nervous that the annestesia will boost the effects of the hydros and make me not wake up, pray before they put me under. Wake up everything's good. I still had 2 hydros left so I checked them literally an hour ago and read the engraved writing on it. They are white oval shaped and read Watson, and below that ""853"" look it up and realize they are 10mg pills and that I took double what I thought I was taking. Oof. 

Just wanted to know if it was common for a dose like that with no tolerance to last that long? I was fucked up for nearly 12 hours only other drugs that have done me like that are psychedelics.

When I was in the worst of my addiction there would be up to 7 pills in that baggie every day. Sure, I had dealers and bought from them. But my mom also had a prescription for the drug I was buying, and figured by doing this I wouldn't feel like I had to seek out drugs and I could use and get high, without getting myself into any bad situations. This started when I came to her telling her I was an addict and wanted help. 

Of course her plan was to slowly wean me down, which we did. Unsuccessfully. Every time she got her script I seemed to have an excuse as to why I needed extra and I'd milk that excuse for so long. Until she didn't have enough to give me my normal amount every day either. So she'd buy some and we'd have a talk and I'd agree to try again. This lasted a few months, until I finally decided to go on methadone. When I did I felt so much better, I didn't need to use anymore. I could get through the day without it. Except all my chronic pain came back, and so did the unbearable migraines three times a week at least. And imagine a doctor would prescribe any sort of pain meds? (Even though none of my doctor's know in an addict). So, I started asking her for a few every day and I was spiralling down that hole. So one day when she came to drop off my smokes with the little baggie attached to the side she told me she understood im in pain and offered to give me one a day, without fail. No more, no less. And that I didn't have to take it, but if I needed it it would at least be there and asked me if that would make me feel a bit better and not feel like I always had to be finding my next pills to make sure that when pain did start I had something. It was turning it into a sure thing. I agreed. Sometimes I have to take more than one, like when I had to have a few teeth pulled or when I had my d&c after my miscarriage and sometimes on just a really bad day pain wise, and she'll agree but she keeps tabs and if I ask top many days in a row she asks my what's bothering me, and sometimes I don't even realize something is until she asks, and once we talk about it it's easy to go back to just having the one. There have been times that I've been able to go weeks without taking the pills she drops off and I don't have any temptation to, and I love when that happens. There are other times (like now and recently) that I don't touch that pill because I've been using heroin. 

Obviously I'll always have my bad days, and I know I'll relapse and I know that's normal. But the fact that she listens when no doctor really does means a lot. My family doctor wants to give me a script, she believes in in as much pain as I am as often as I claim to be, but she says in too young (im almost 21, she's been saying this since I started complaining of pain at 16). The doctor at the methadone clinic also recently brought up that he's considering giving me a script for pain as well, and it feels nice to finally be getting somewhere. I can't wait until the day that I don't have to rely on my mom to drop off a pill for me every day. But I love her so much for doing so, and for understanding that my addiction didn't form only from mental pain, but from physical too and that I can't get better until the pain im in is under control. I love her so much and thank her every day for supporting me.

Tinychat can be VERY shitty about the mobile app so if you can connect with a computer, that is the best option.
firstly, this chat is not affiliated with this subreddit or its moderators, and has its own moderators, rules, and etiquette. if you feel someone there has slighted you take it up with the moderators of tinychat, as it is completely unaffiliated with and not endorsed by this or any other subreddit.
just a reminder and an announcement that a bunch of your fellow degenerate junkies, chippers, and tourists hang out in our very own tinychat room which has been an ongoing tradition for something like four years now. the location, for those who can't do links for whatever reason, is http://tinychat.com/ropiatesubchat.


tinychat is an extremely buggy videochat client, but also the only one that fills its particular niche---that being, anyone who knows the room name may enter, and it has a youtube player. any technical difficulties may be addressed by the moderator, namely me. we like to hang out, listen to music, talk about random shit, and lately have even had our own resident sketch artist who draws random crap upon request. the primary purposes for the room's existence are companionship and harm reduction---it's nice to be able to shoot up with others around, even if you are technically alone in the non-digital sense, and have people keeping an eye on you. we're also glad to help with any problems you might be having, or questions you might need answered. we aim to be a welcoming, friendly space for the members of this subreddit to do what we do in good company without judgement. so stop by if you are bored, or just need to talk.
if it appears like there is a moderator in the room but who is not speaking, just type a few sentences to summon them back. if you are on mobile it is not immediately apparent that there is anyone in the room. either click the button shaped like an outline of a person (i think) to see the list, or say hello to see if anyone responds.


rules:
pick a unique username. this is to protect other users so we know who is who, given the nature of the sort of activities we enjoy.
no lurking. again, to protect the other users. if you come in the room be prepared to introduce yourself and participate for at least a few minutes so we know you're not up to any shenanigans. if you are lurking you will be warned and then given a generous ten minutes to announce yourself. if the time runs out, you will be kicked (not banned) until you are ready to come in and actually participate. if you are a known member whose identity can be confirmed, this rule is not applicable.


no -isms or hate speech, even accidental. one warning will be issued, any continued insistence on such behavior will result in a ban. bans can be contested by pm'ing a moderator (me). this includes but is not limited to racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia. for example, if you are not black, use of the n-word, even with the -a ending, will not be tolerated. i don't care if your friend down the block lets you say it, it's not your lane.


no auditory fuckery. due to peculiarities of the transmission of sound over a chat, certain echos and effects can be amplified to the point of being severely distressing. if it is determined that your end is causing an echo you will be asked to use headphones, or to mute your microphone when not speaking. deliberately making strange or unpleasant noises to annoy other chatters will not be tolerated, and your broadcast will be closed. (this only means that your video/audio feed will be terminated--you will still be allowed to type.)

This hasn't been easy. Look what you made me do. *(bonus points if you catch the cheesy reference)* 

I originally joined r/opiates roughly 5 years ago. Mainly to gain insight into my brother's Heroin addiction and death. As I gained that insight I was ultimately getting sick myself. It took a year to diagnose me with a rare condition that has led to chronic pancreatitis and what I still expect is a lifetime of pain.

For 4-5 years I've been on and off the opioids and for the last 3 years I've been on them nonstop. 

During my opiate career I've had two boyfriends both non-users. The first would berate me over my addiction and pain problems but was a complete alcoholic. Double standards much? I think so. 

The 2nd boyfriend came within the last four months. He's been very sweet and we've been talking a lot about my health especially since I was starting to consider a need to get off the opiates even a few months before we met. 

However, as time with him went on and I got to a point where things were do or die for me, myself, I & my future with this new guy. ^(you know how you know it's the one? That's how I feel about this guy) 

So, when I ran out of my script 5 days early and had no money to supplement it, I made a difficult decision. I jumped off the medication cold turkey.

I was on an average of 70mgs of the stuff before I went something like this:

* Day 1: 50mgs
* Day 2: 40mgs
* Day 3: 35mgs
* Day 4: 25mgs
* Day 5: 0mgs

I consumed my last dose at 7pm on November 25th, 2017. Ironically, if we turned the clock back 7 years my brother would be alive for another 5 days before he'd die of his Heroin OD. I would be clean & sober the day of his death for the first time in 5 years. It's kinda spooky to me and means something. I don't know I've always believed in dates and time and things like that, that everything is connected for a reason and sometimes ***what you think is bad isn't always the worst thing. Sometimes it's even good***.

With that said I've been battling a Kidney Infection plus my period on top of the withdrawal so needless to say it's been intense. Since quitting some big things I've done are as follows:

1. Declined Narcotics at my Drs. Office
2. Flushed a 10mg Oxycodone Tablet Down the Toliet
3. Declined my usual refill & declined a muscle relaxant as well
4. informed all my Doctors of the change

I am becoming a new person. Entirely. They say every 7 years your cells regenerate to make you new again and 7 years past my brother's death, I am finally new again.",1512184530.0

Is that an allergic reaction to the cut, or what happened there? It’s happened before with a different stamp a while ago, but was much more mild than what I experienced this time. I’m not entirely sure what that means or what happened? I’m assuming it’s a histamine reaction since I didn’t miss. It was in my blood and started fuckin my shit up??

Let me know what you guys think, you will identify with it 10x more than your average reader.","Ok, a quick background on this. Before I started shooting roxies and Opanas and dope, I was one of the highest rated creepypasta authors in the site's all time index, and I was the head of the Monolith forum there before derpbutt purchased the site from WhoWasPhone.

I had written plenty of horror stories. Creature features, ghost tales, you name it. However, when I finally went to treatment for my addiction, I hadn't written any fiction in two years. I stopped caring about fiction even though I was a published author on Amazon. My excuse at first was ""The drugs make me creative,"" but eventually, I didn't create. I just got high and nodded on my couch.

I'll be celebrating a year clean on January 9th, 2018. I wrote the first story of this series, Anhedonius, freehand in a notebook when I was detoxing off dope and afraid of all the meetings and hanging out with fellow junkies in rehab. I finished it about a month later, and then I wrote a sequel.

This is a horror fiction story about a heroin junkie who gets kidnapped by a pharmaceutical company that basically invents a cure for cancer and any other serious disease, but they have to murder and farm people with altered Mu receptors in their brains to manufacture it. It's very long, but quite horrific, and I poured my heart and soul into it, because for all intents and purposes, the main character is basically the way I was when I was on drugs.

Instead of reading Anhedonius, you can listen to if if you want on The Mad Catter's Twisted Teatime podcast, which is on iTunes, Soundcloud, Stitcher, and all that shit. Or you can just go to the youtube link.

[www.creepypasta.com/anhedonius](www.creepypasta.com/anhedonius) (to read) or

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8bYj_FEpzo&t=104s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8bYj_FEpzo&t=104s) (to listen)

The sequel, Liquid Blue, should be uploaded on creepypasta within 24 hours, as I just finished it about two hours ago. No podcast for this one yet, but if you're from San Francisco or you're familiar with the Tenderloin, it's right up your ""alley.""

Liquid Blue:

If you'd like to purchase one of my novels off Amazon from the old days or donate to me, I'll be publishing a new short story compilation in January, but all I really ask is for reviews for my writing on creepypasta/NoSleep/Pseudopod or any other medium that my writing has been accepted in.

Thank you for reading, and remember, there is a way out, and you can care again about things that fell by the wayside as this shit slowly takes over your life. You can get it back, because I did. It wasn't easy, but I did it, and you can too.

Stay warm, guys, and I hope you enjoy this. I worked very hard on it.

I've partied hard with every other type of drug but could always put them down, but you can't escape the physical dependency of opiates. So with that being the case, I'm always at odds with myself and if I have it, it's hard to let myself get sick just to get the good buzz. I guess I'd rather stay well than super high.

My boss couldn't pay me until like 5 hours after I got off and I was starting to get sick. I only had enough cash for half of my normal pickup and it would not have been nearly close to enough to keep me well until after work the following day and my dboy shuts down shop before I would be getting paid tonight. I decided it would be my monthly ask for a front and get shot down day. So I ask and even tell him a can pay him tonight outside of business hours... And he says yes! Oh my god.  I was stoked and already about to meet him. Then 5 minutes go by and he texts and says he doesn't want to front anymore.  WTF? I called him and was like what the hell you just said you would and we proceed to go back and forth and he finally says, after me guaranteeing that I could pay him tonight,  ""Aight, we gon do this then champ"" I said ""hell yeah we are!

I'm still pretty new to reddit (long time lurker) and I've had a question that's been on my mind for the past year - though extensive searching online hasn't yielded much. 
Does anyone have any personal experience with diprenorphine (bupe's super high affinity cousin)? The wiki article and a few other research articles online state that is has a very small amount of agonist activity. I'm mostly interested in its potential use as a mild buzz for anyone being forced into Vivitrol/naltrexone since it's one of the few opioids that can easily out-bind naltrexone (and nobody tests for it). Any experience/comments would be helpful. Thanks!

How the fuck do I achieve that? I've tried therapy. I've tried medication. I've tried detox. I've overdosed. My mindset never changed. I want to feel good forever. The harsh truth is you need to experience that pain to grow. I wish I could tell you what drove me to get clean. It wasn't about living because I OD'd and had to be revived and I kept using. 

The thing is, I didn't use to hurt other's. My using brought on pain to the people around me that I don't want to feel. My reason for using was an escape from having to experience those negative emotions. I never thought I'd change my mind.

One day I woke up and just didn't want to shoot heroin anymore. I wasn't afraid of the sickness anymore. My biggest fear at that time was losing myself. 

I don't even remember my clean date because we're constantly changing and for me to mark a change isn't my vibe. I just know every Tuesday is another week I didn't use. So maybe that is counting. 

I'm rambling now but the main point I was trying to make is that I just woke up one day and didn't want to use. The sight of heroin turns my stomach. I used to get boners looking at prepped  needles but now it makes me sick.

As Sara gets out to pay some random tells her he thinks a couple guys ODed in their car on the other side of the parking lot. Visibly freaked out Sara asks if I'd check it out and of course I agree not wanting anyone to die if it can be helped.

Both guys have their chins on their chests and certainly look dead so I knock on the window and when that gets no response I open the drivers unlocked door. It was at this time I got a good look at the driver and realized I know the guy, I also realized they were both breathing but just to make sure they were alright I tried to wake them. My friend (Guy) slept through me yelling his name and shaking him, his passenger woke up but when I warned him of the probable police appearance in the near future he just mumbled something at me and closed his eyes again. That's when someone walks up to me from the store and asks if I had a light so we walk to my car so I can get him one.

After handing this guy a lighter he asks if I get high, since we've never met I say no and even though I said no dude starts offering me Xanax and ice then asks if he can come with Sara and I. Of course I say no and that's when Sara comes back to the car and tells us the girls working there had called the cops cuz dude wouldn't leave and was freaking them put. I run to Guy's car, slap the fuck out of him and when he finally wakes up I warn him about the cops, run back to Sara's car and got the fuck out of there.

My phone goes off and I see it's Guy thanking me for the wake up call, apparently he was up for way to long and crashed waiting for the creepy guy who was only supposed to be grabbing smokes but just never came back out. I told him about his creepy friend getting the cops called and he said soon as dide got high he started acting weird, then I made him promise to take a nap and here I am!

There's not really a point to this story but I would like to acknowledge the way everyone assumed these two guys ODed when the only thing to suggest they use heroin is they're sleeping in their car and in their early twenties.

ive gone through withdrawals the 10th time this year (or more) and have no money to continue. im one week off opiates again, after a 1 week relapse-- and smoking just costs so much.

i have .1g left, and no money for a month after that-- aswell as a needle exchange programme that offers injection advice as harm reduction.

i want my final hit to be a warning to myself. i feel i need to put myself in that corner instead of being one foot in and one foot out-- either binging or withdrawing.

is it that much more cost effective to use the needle, and how destructive is it to your veins with clean apparatus and DNM dope?

i know smoking is the fastest way for a drug to reach the brain, so with no tolerance am i simply better off smoking a giant blob at once? since the needle rush, i assume, is because tolerance prevents any rush from smoking as it would take several hits-- while at baseline tolerance could smoking a BIG hit achieve the same results?",1512353111.0

Well, after a few texts to a handful of posters I found this one dude who wanted to talk on the phone first before texting. That was alright with me because herring the person's voice makes it easier to see if they're up to something grimey or just hoping you're not a cop and a cool person. I felt comfortable meeting up with the dude after speaking to him and was confident he was legit.  

Got to the meeting spot, waited 10 mins, talked to the dude for a bit, made the transaction and boom!!...success!  

Just picked up a g just in case it was bunk, fake or I got ripped off. It's good stuff and pleased with how it all went down. Got lucky on my first time and glad nothing sketchy went down.

This isn't a gratuitous shot, it's a small sampling of the crazy amount of prescriptions that I still have left over.  This is about a third of everything tucked away for the last 2 years.

Here in the US, a lot of chronic pain patients set aside a portion of their scripts each month. This is mainly because they know that when they go in for their next monthly visit to get scripts, there is a good chance the doctor will not prescribe what they need.  The DEA looks for ANYTHING that will give them cause to suspend a pain specialist's license.  

In Florida, the DEA now sets up stings like this regularly.  Recently, an undercover agent got prescribed 2 week's worth of hydrocodone (qty 30 - 5/325) for claiming and ACTING like they hurt their back.  The doctor knew that he shouldn't write for a full month and wanted to see if the the guy came back with an MRI as requested.  The next day, the DEA raided the place.  It wasn't a cash-only ""pain clinic"" but a general practitioner who had been in business for over 30 years.

Since the DEA is waging war on doctors now, many patients are choosing to stash a portion from what may be their last script.  There is even a small but growing delivery industry in cities like Miami and Tampa, catering to older people who have had their meds taken away or cut back.  It's not unheard of for many senior citizens to actually procure heroin through these delivery services, as hydro and oxy are both now ~$1 per mg.  It is sickening to me; people who take advantage of other people and the government that forces their hand are creating businesses that feed on someone's medical need.

I've woken up, dosed 4g, then remembered I won't be home until midnight, dosed 1mg of sub like 40 minutes later - no problem).

Yesterday while my wife was out with our kid was the first real alone time I had instead of having to sneak quick smokes in, and I found myself putting a humongous chunk - like half of what was left of the g I got, onto the foil, and I didn't stop until it was all fucking gone. I was finally *high* high. And I couldn't believe how much I was and to smoke and handle it. Was at least 3 points. I tossed the tiny bit that was left in the garbage and went off to do house cleaning. Didn't puke didn't nod just feeling amazing. The act of throwing the rest away actually helped have a good high and not worry about how much more I'll do, but I was far from proud of myself. 


I feel fine today. Tar is gone, back on kratom, but I obviously am still fucking addicted which was a huge bummer to realize. 10 months on this kratom shit too and I've been unable to lower my intake to any significant degree, and now am back to more like 20-25g a day. No breaks for the holidays - everything will either be working or spending time with family; no time to lie on bed feeling like shit but at least recovering. Then it'll be back to the normal grind. No end in sight, I'm gonna be drinking this sludge three times a day for the foreseeable future.",1512322523.0

Anyways, l have been on methadone and suboxone and personally feel like methadone is helping me far more than suboxone. Of coarse one reason could be the structure of the methadone clinic and making sure I️ dose everyday. Obviously there are ways to get around having to dose everyday at the clinic by making yourself throw up the dose, getting take home eligible ( using clean urine or using one of many loop holes for drug test), or just skipping the trip to clinic and not dosing the days you want to skip. With suboxone it was nice to get a full two week to a months worth script at the start of treatment but resulted in those being sold and running short sometimes.. however this is getting off subject... l honestly feel like methadone is much harder to use heroin and be able to reach a decent high than suboxone. This seems hard to believe because suboxone has a blocker in it but methadone forms a hell of a blocker once over 60 mg for at least a couple months. Even when l skip four to five days of methadone the high is short lived. The rush after the injection is followed by a non euphoric waiste of a high that isn’t even being high.. With subs l found that it is easy to break thru the blocker of the dose is lower like 4mg or less. But if it has built up in higher doses then waiting 2 or 3 days without taking suboxone and then shoot heroin produces a very nice high from heroin. Of coarse one must be careful dosing the suboxone after taking heroin because of precipitated Wd. I’m just wondering other experiences with this and would love to know Any tricks to being a chipper on maintenance therapy. I’m on 65 mg methadone currently and have lowered my dose from 90 in hopes to feel dope more but still have the benefits of methadone and it has helped some . l feel dope about 10-15% of what I️ should . .....why can’t us junkies find the perfect drug to keep Wd away but be able to get high when we want and feel normal and good when we don’t ",1512484726.0

Fast forward to today. I've burned several bridges, ran off on a couple plugs in times of dire need. I've lost control of my habit and it shows. I wear the same old clothes, haven't bought new shoes in over a year. Most of my friends have cut ties with me or at least distanced themselves and the ones that haven't feel pity and are on the fence of whether or not to leave. I'm a laughing stock I feel among my social circle. 

But it's all worth it right? I try to get clean, tell myself ""this is it"" every time, but every payday it seems I lose control. What's worse is I can't even envision myself in a life without opiates. I have crippling anxiety around my family, for instance. I don't know how to act around kids and my nieces and nephews try to connect with me and I'd love to, but when I'm sober I'm a cold shell. When I'm high I'm the most loving uncle, brother and son.

It’s sort of a face my own fears thing since I’ve always had a phobia of needles going into my veins as well as simple curiosity and to be able to say I’ve done/ can do it (probably not gonna actually tell anyone of course lol).  Also, it was a combination of hanging out on this sub sort of desensitizing me to the idea of IVing as well as my intention for a while now to run a cycle of steroids (which I do have) and therefore needing to buy rigs for IM injections anyways so might as well buy insulin syringes while I’m at it. 

I haven’t actually injected anything yet, I did two ‘tests’ if you will tonight, both times I was planning on injecting a saline solution I made but decided against it on both occasions for different reasons. 

The first time was into the big vein in the crook of the arm, got it in on the first try and registered dark red, lazy blood so I know I was good but I noticed a decent sized air bubble in the syringe so I decided against injecting just to be safe. 

The second time was in a vein a little further up on the forearm and it went smoothly as well but this time it was like it registered without me pulling the plunger. I figured there must have been some dead space in there and it plumed up because I hit the vein but it was a very small amount of blood and it caused a small raised area around the injection site which I assumed was just blood leaking out of the vein, but since I didn’t know if I had accidentally gone all the way through the vein or what so I again pulled it out and abstained from injecting to be safe. It doesn’t hurt or anything but I put a warm compress on it anyways and then a bandage. 

Any thoughts guys? Tips? This sort of just a bucket list thing like learning how to fly a small plane or learning a new language or something like that. I may use this skill to IV a drug one day if I got ahold of something that wouldn’t be effective orally like morphine (not dope, I’m talking pharmaceuticals) but that’s not necessarily the end goal. I like my hydro just fine and there’s no need to inject it or all that APAP lol. I will continue practicing and would like advice, I also gotta practice the IM injections for the testosterone so I gotta lot of poking myself to do, pins and needles amirite? I got like 100 of each kind though so I don’t mind wasting a lot of them to get it down right. ",1512453695.0

It’s white, and it seems to stick to stick to itself pretty bad. Does that seem like anything someone is semi familiar with or nah?

Like I thought U-47700 was active nasally, but it was just caustic to the point to make it want to be avoided for insufflation; whatever this is is for sure caustic, but almost not even noticeable in terms of a high when insufflated. Does anybody have an idea of if this is like a bunk cut or an idea of the chemical series whatever this is is in.

Whatever it is isn’t even noticeable when insufflated though (asides from having a nosebleed the next day), but like with swallowing the drip it feels similar to oxy (with out as much of a blissful rush, just more of a sedated and relaxed type feeling), it’s white, and it seems to rock up way worse than the fent laced stuff I was getting (like it sticks to credit cards way worse).",1512453393.0

First, my latest user handle gets banned by a cocksucker mod in the r/Rainbow6 sub because he disagreed with my points on best operators for certain modes, the fuck ever. This happens Friday late night. Then Saturday afternoon one of my old dope middles texts me and asks me if I'd want some 10 mg methadones at $5 each. Well of course I fucking do!! I meet up with him, drives me over to dboys house, I score 20 of them (ended up doing 2 with junkie middle on ride back talking our asses off and I throw him one for hookup and all the driving/etc. And I must say, these things have been getting me HIGH AS FUCK the past few days. Honestly enjoying the long ass buzz I've been getting from snorting them. RIP my poor nose. Love the burn tbh.

Just wondering if anyone else actually enjoys the high that methadone gives? I mean oxy or H to me is still champ but the buzz from these is pretty damn good. And the sexy long ass legs oh baby baby lol.

TL;DR shit post from chipper/user who had been clean a month but shit fell in his lap, couldn't resist, and he's back to snorting and eating the nectar of the gods that is opis. Fingers crossed that I can keep it to occasional use/chipping status.",1512451868.0

First off I'm a bit of a sook, I'm only currently using high dose oxycodone and I can't imagine kicking H or god forbid F, however I have been using opiates starting with codeine since longer than I can actually remember and in between have used strong 'pure' H powder and fent spray bottles bought from online (but not for the last 7 or so months).

Anyways I have been using nearly daily oxycodone (or at least 4-5 days of the week) getting close to 200mg of it a day. I have a source who alternates weekly between 20x30mg slow release OXY and 20x20mg instant release oxynorm (I am from Australia.) I buy these weekly and it is costing me an absolute fortune.

Apart from my bank account being raped, I just absolutely cannot stand the withdrawls I go through when I run out. I work 2 jobs 7 days a week however one is pretty chill and from @ home so I try to time when I run out during this period (Monday & Tuesday) and from wednesday to sunday I work at one of australia's standard supermarkets as a cleaner & trolley pusher.

I cannot work the supermarket job during withdrawls, I always end up curled up in a corner and do absolutely the bare minimum (somehow) for my entire shift.

I'd love to tell you my life story and all my problems but you've heard it all before and I'm just another dickhead who played with fire and now is complaining about the burns..

Anyways can someone please help me with a taper plan / schedule for 4 x 30mg slow release oxy (choppable) and 20 x 20 instant release oxy.

Everytime I try I become a pig and eat too much in one sitting but I've promised myself this lot is for tapering and for some reason I am confident I can stick to it, as the deterrents are starting to over ride the small 'high' feeling the oxy produces me.

I appreciate any help thank you",1512451192.0

I've written this and rewrote it four times but it just keeps becoming too long. So here I go again, if this gets posted then it must be short enough.


&nbsp;


**Phase 1:**

[Cliff convinced me to give up the last of my money two weeks ago for a really good price on bulk subs.]() A week later he pays me back with a portion of his roxy script. The following week I can't pick up my sub script until my new photo ID comes in so I buy some dope for the two of us. Cliff assures me that he'll have subs before the week is over.


&nbsp;


**Phase 2:**

Each day I get another forestallment. ""We don't need them today anyway, we both still have pills.""


By saturday I get to the bottom of the barrel and am met with more forestallments. Hell, he even had me come outside the night before to meet the girl who he was middling for. You see, ""it was part of the deal"" that she gets subs while he middles for her. Up until that moment I was expecting her to have subs.

As we're waiting outside I start getting indicatiosn that she might not have subs on her right now, which is why he wants me to come outside to hear their convrsation. So that I know I'm not being deceived. 

&nbsp;

He says to the girl that getting subs on Saturday is ""much importante"" to which she responds, ""I'll try."" Fuck this shit. ""I'll try"" is a far cry fro mthe high expecations that were originally set.


Then on saturday, although I was told she'd get the subs in the morning I don't find out for sure til 3pm.. at which point I'm told she's picking them up at 6pm. After 6pm I text Cliff, ""so she has the subs"" to which he responds, ""ya"". 

When I get ""ya"" in place of an affirmateive yes, I read it like a tell. A sign that I'm being lied to. So of course, she doesn't want to make two trips so she's not dropping off the subs until Cliff can see his pill connect. 

&nbsp;


An hour keeps getting added to the ETA for the pill guy. Around 11pm I get another forestallment and quitely snap. I say that I shoudl've gone to his sister at 8PM to get the subs and now it's too late to get them tonight. **He goes ""ahh, you're doing it again, stressing me out."" To which I respond, ""you're stressing me out.""** 

Honestly, every time I need to get subs in a timely manner through Cliff I always get screwed. Like when I was robbed two weeks ago (which turned out to be an impromptu loan) or any other time that I posted about such woes.


&nbsp;


Cliff warns me about his sister, ""don't give her money ahead of time."" In reality, she's proven to be honorable whenever I hand her money. Him on the other hand, often a story or an excuse when I don't get cash back that he was given for a deisgnated purpose. At present he's sitting on $40 for subs that he may or may not need. He even showed me the money the other day to prove he didn't spend it but for all I know that's the money he's holding to buy pills for his lady friend/client.


&nbsp;

**Phase 3:**


Well, I go to work in the early stages of WD on Sunday. Throughout the work day I'm checking if the pill guy showed up yet so that the girl with the subs would show up. Ultmately I'm given the option to come back to our 'hood on my lunch break for two tiny bumps of H. It took away the chills for a short while and made it easier for me to push through the remainder of my shift.


Cliff's sister couldn't get subs all day on Sunday. **At 10PM his sister texts me saying that she can get subs in the morning on Monday.** Cliff on the other hand says he's seeing his pill guy at 5AM. Cliff never sees his pill guy until afternoon and now the pill guy has to reup before he can make the trade with his lady friend for subs.


&nbsp;

**Phase 4:**

Anyway, after freezing and sweating in my bed and after my last brief stint of sleep I emerge a little before 11AM. I text Cliff's sister at that time and she responds immediately that she got them!


So Cliff is 2/10 and his sister is 4/4 when it comes to procuring subs without complications.


Funny thing is that Cliff makes it like his sister is the most evil thief of a cunt but she has never screwed me over. On the other hand Cliff once stole his sister's prescribed perc 10's when she dropped them on the floor so go figure. She doesn't annoy me as long as I keep my word about coming through to help fix her computer when requested.


She smokes dust to unwind at times but keeps her word. One time she needed help with her computer after I worked for 12 hours and kept bringing up the fact that she helped me with subs the week earlier.

After that we had a talk and arrived at an understanding. I'll help her with her computer and she won't mention she gets me subs in front of her brother ever again. This isn't always important since I sometimes share but sometimes I rather keep extra subs to myself since Cliff's word is worth shit. 


&nbsp;

The current policy has already served me well. I bought two subs the week before Thanksgiving and Black Friday (14+ hours of work in retail) and didn't share any with Cliff. If I did share with Cliff and counted on him to get subs in the middle of the week, I probably would've gone to work feelign sickly.


&nbsp;


Take-aways:


* Cliff always runs into complications that ""are not his fault"" when being depended upon to get subs.


* Clff's sister always keeps her word. When circumstances beyond her control get in the way, I know she's not making that shit up.


* Although Cliff's sister got two subs, I told Cliff she could only get one and split that one with him. He didn't even need it after getting pills today anyway! (he middled for another person altogether)


* I shoudln't have given him even half a sub. He's getting more tonight anyway as part of revised plans. (yeah, right).

* Seriously, about the previous bullet point: He says his pill connect is coming within the hour and the girl he's middling for will come by at the same time.


* I'm never going to give money to Cliff ever again for subs. Ever. Too complex, too stressful. Way easier to go through his sister. 


* I can buy 8 subs through his sister next week, give 2 to Cliff and I'll still be good through Christmas.


&nbsp;


Lastly, if I had a dime every time Cliff said ""within the hour"" or ""soon"" I'd have a few bucks. I think he'd rather be high than well to the point that he's only interested in getting subs when he's sick for two days and has no other options. I'm glad I hedged my bets and had enough extra cash to myself to buy subs on my own.



The bottom line --- NEVER count on Cliff to get subs. 


P.S.- When I went to get those bumps on my lunch break, I walked into a friend of a friend whom I thought sold dope. Spent $20 on him too and ended up with a twenty bag of crack. Thought it was dope so snorted it. When my throat got numb, I figured it must be coke so I snorted the rest of it but it didn't have the same effect. Oh well, at least I've still never smoked crack.",1512430999.0

One thing i need to mention that has to be related - - As well as this, i’ve been getting very much **LESS high** since nodding out harder than ever a month back...

I came back to this fent mix after a break and it rocked me very hard nearly into OD territory... since then, i’ve barely been able to shrink my pupils back down, very poor high. I’ve attributed this purely to tolerance because what else?

Could someone please try to help me with my situation, doctors are stumped","So I have chronic migraines and chronic daily headaches. I was warned a couple years ago to stay away from opiates because they could trigger even worse rebound headaches, but of course I didn't listen and abused opiates to treat the pain. These triggered horrifically painful chronic headaches, which I got sort-of under control with topamax, but they still hurt.

I was put on suboxone for cravings. I had reservations-- If opiates gave me rebound headaches, wouldn't subs? Doctor suggested I just try it. So he put me on 12 mg of subs, which is a hell of a lot more than the equivalent of what I was using before.

Well, surprise surprise, a week and a half after starting subs I get the worst level of headaches that I possibly have. I call them ""life or death"" headaches because the pain is so extreme that I become incoherent and have attempted suicide before. These migraines are absolutely no joke. It's all consuming, transcendent pain. I can't even offer a reasonable description.

This severe headache lasted three days, during which time I was unable to eat or sleep. 

This pattern of a life or death headache returning every week or sometimes twice a week recurred. I begged my neurologist to increase my topamax, which helped a little, but I was still in great pain every week.

After two months of putting up with this senseless horror, I cut myself off suboxone cold turkey at very beginning of November.

I'm about four weeks out of no suboxone, and while I have consumed some kratom, I am *still* having these awful rebound headaches. 

Are there any migraineurs here in r/opiates who might have some thoughts? How much longer will I have to wait to for the headaches to settle down? The last time I consumed any opiate was kratom last Tuesday, so I'm about a week clean of everything.",1512410801.0

Came out the hospital Sunday morning from heroin overdose. It was absolutely terrifying.,"Man, I feel like total shit. Let me tell you, that was the scariest fucking experience of my life. God damn.

Well here's the story. I wanted to die. I felt I had no purpose in life, I got kicked out of my drug rehab program because of bad attendance, I can't find a job to save my life, and I live in my moms house who resents me completely and can't wait to kick me out. I'm 20 years old by the way.

So I gathered up money I've been saving and went to my dealer to get a bun. But the thing is, I wasn't buying it to get high. I was buying it to overdose. I wanted to die a peaceful death and away from this misery. 

I came back a bit late and my mom just told me to sleep outside because I came home 20 minutes after her bedtime. I said please please let me in. But nope all she gave me was a glass of water she left in the backyard. I thought okay, perfect. Its better I die away from my family to risk scarring them. I would go and die peacefully in some empty park late at night.

I can't see worth shit and I couldnt risk the wind sweeping away my dope, so I went to a lower level of the backyard where there was a table and where the fences were high enough to protect the dope from sweeping away.

I poured out a fat ass little mountain of dope (basically my whole bun) and rolled up a paper from my book bag so I could sniff it (I didn't have any straws). Next thing I know I dived my nose in that dopey mountain of heaven and sniffed away. I sniffed and sniffed until it was all gone and I felt the nice bitter drip down my throat.

I then decided to walk away from my house and into the night and wander till the high slowly got stronger, and man did it get strong.

I went to my friends house and by then I was fucking high as shit, but I was terrified at the same time because in my mind I knew I was going to die. That this high was my free express trip to the underworld. 

I went to my friends house and asked him for water (yeah makes a lot of sense right? I'm willingly dying and still I want water) he gets me a cup and let's me sit on his porch when I tell him what happened and that I was about to die.

Then he says... ""So you don't even bless me up with a free bag"" he got angry cause I didn't save one bag for him and then he tells me to get the fuck out his house and goes back in leaving me sitting on his porch. He comes back 2 minutes later angrier with his fists up and starting cursing at me to get the fuck out of his house and calls me a junkie.

I then stumbled and left and back to wandering the night alone, the higher getting ever stronger that I could barely function walking normally.

I went to some guy in a deli and asked for a free cup of water (again with the water... I don't know what I was thinking maybe I was actually scared of death at this point) and he said for me to get lost.

I then went to this gas station market thing and asked for water and he gave it to me nicely. I drank it and mumbled thank you and left.

By then my plan was to go to the park about 10 minutes away and just sleep on the bench and not wake up again. 

The higher was not even at its peak and even then I was really getting terrified but relaxed at the same time. Its like my mind was screaming for help, and my body was just a malfunctioning robot. I was losing my body.


I approached the park where I crossed this man cleaning up in front of his shop, when he greets me nicely and I ignore him. He then calls out to me and asks me if I was okay and if I needed an ambulance. I then tried to puke but nothing but spit came out. He then told me he was going to call an ambulance and he waited outside with me holding me telling me I was going to be alright.


The ambulance came quick as fuck and I immediately asked if I was going to jail. They told me no and moved me slowly to the bed in the ambulance. They were nice but at this point I was so fucking high I couldn't really talk good or even breath good. They gave me an oxygen tube thing that went to my nose and I don't really remember but the lady had a nice casual conversation with me... Acting like I was a toddler. She smiled at me and treated me like I just won the spelling bee every time I responded to a question.

We went to the hospital I was on the bed and.. I was crying at this point and asked to call my dad. He came in and saw me and was crushed at the sight of me. As soon as he found out it was a heroin overdose and then left.

Then the scary fucking part happened. It was like nothing I experienced before. I don't know what happened. Its like the next thing I know I was SURROUNDED by doctors and I heard my heart monitor going crazy. But it was all so surreal. I really felt like.. I was in small box or something. Its hard to explain. My doctor was telling me to calm down and to breath. 

Later I found out my heart stopped and they said it was the medication kicking in... I asked them if I didn't go to a hospital if I would have died... They said yes, I would have died. I almost fucking died IN the hospital.

I laid there looking at my heart moniter...anxious whnever I started hearing it out abornally. I was so fucking scared.

I also pissed my pants without knowng it and they gave me an adult diaper... yeah. I woke up the next morning not being ale to move my legs, and could barely squeeze out any piss when I finaly made it to the bathroom.

My mom came worried and stayed with me and I just talked to her about what happened... and anyways I was discharged.  I came home and lad in bed and had the most weirdest fucking dreams. 

Scary as hell. Right now I kinda wish I did die, because I feel even more worthless then I did a week ago, now I just feel less alive. My body is still weird and my chest hurts. Did I mention I threw like a motherfucker in the hospital? Yeah what did I expect, right? Anyways thanks for readinng. Just wanted to share.",1512410637.0

I haven't come around in a while, but my entire heroin-worshipping life just changed from such a simple trick that I HAD to share for anyone else who loves banging but struggles to hit.

My veins have always been horrible; even as a child, nurses and phlebotomists would have to work really hard to find one for blood tests. Fast forward to opiates, and I would watch an ex-bf with glorious veins register with such ease and feel SO FUCKING ENVIOUS because he had to dig in my arms forever to get me and I could NEVER hit when I tried on my own.

Since my semi-recent relapse, I've mostly just been snorting a ton trying to get to that place we all love, but then my absolute favorite all-star dboy got outta jail and hooked me up with another client who said he'd help me out for a bag or two. Apparently dude is responsible for hitting a whole house full of junkies that live together and is just a vein whispering god or whatever.

So I show up and start tying off as hard as possible to try to facilitate the process, and he goes ""Nah I don't even need that."" Skeptical, I untied and stuck my forearm out. This guy turns out the lights, whips out a flashlight, slides it along my skin, and HOLY FUCKING SHIT my entire circulatory system was lit up like a neon roadmap to heroin oblivion. 

My jaw dropped. He tilted the light to see the rig a little and hit me right away in a huge vein running through a weird spot in my forearm (even in spite of the area being all scarred from cutting as a kid) and pushed off. Voilà.

Anyway maybe people already know, but I've been around for a while with lots of IV users who struggle and have never seen that, so I just wanted to share in case anyone finds it helpful! Obviously, a cell phone flashlight would be perfectly effective too.

My days of digging around are overrrrr!",1512406698.0

I owed him 800 (200+200+400) from before and he said forget the 400 and I can pay off the rest over time. I paid him 50 and he doesn’t bring it up anymore. 

So I been sick as fuck from the vivitrol shot and was puking everywhere. He spotted me 2 bs yesterday 1/2 a b from last week and I said I got him so he came and just gave me 2 more bs. I owe him 320. I wrote a check for 320 and he gave me the 2. I don’t got the money. I’m fucked. He may seriously hurt me over this. Especially bc he gave me the last 2bs out of his pick up n was reuping with this money. He just called me n threatened me ",1512406069.0

Some of you guys know me and the story of what I have been going through and I just wanted to throw an update out there. I just did a couple years in the ole' jigga and am now out of there and in work release in a city I am not from. I have been waiting on a court order to get signed so that I can go home to house arrest and move on with my life and 35 days later it is finally signed!!!!

So, I have been up all night locked in work release getting fuckin' wrecked, doing oxymorphone and meth, when they come over the loudspeaker calling my name to come to main control...this is usually never a good thing. I get up there and they tell me that my case manager wants to meet with me right now. At about this point I am fucking trippin' because I am spun the fuck out and probably look like complete shit and I have to go meet with her. Note: she is a former heroin/meth addict herself and surely knows exactly what to look for. So I sit down in her office and she immediately tells me that my transfer order has been signed...and then her brow furrows. Uh-oh, I am absolutely fucked! She asks me if I am high right now and I was about to immediately respond, 'fuck no!' but then I got to thinking...I'm about to get dropped. So I go ahead and tell her that I relapsed and it was due to all of the stress and anxiety about getting out of prison and waiting on a tenuous transfer. You know what she did? She told me not to let it happen again and that I am better than that and to get out of her office.

This shit right here scared the living fuck out of me. I am going to be much, much, more careful in the decisions that I make in the near future and really evaluate whether or not I want to go straight back to fucking prison. I have already lost 5 of the last 6 years of my life to this same bullshit ass case. I am tired of wasting my life. I am not going to sit here and lie to you guys and say that I am 100% done with everything, just that I am going to be a lot more cognizant of the choices that I make. 

I am so glad to be back out and back here with you guys. I honestly thought about this subreddit a lot when I was in prison. That might sound fuckin' stupid, but it is the truth. This is the only place and y'all are the only people that I can talk to about this stuff and be completely honest. I just really needed to get this off my chest and vent, I am also still pretty fuckin' geetered out on meth so I will shut the fuck up now! Hope y'all are having a wonderful day and you guys get a break and some good news like I did.",1512405357.0
7hicrb,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7hicrb/when_the_musics_over/,31,https://redd.it/7hicrb,TheOpiumWars,When the music's over,"So right now I have this sweet deal. I'm picking up legit 10mg K56 oxy for 5 bucks a pill in bulk. The problem is I know one day that will end. It could be a month from now it could be a few years but it will end eventually. Then I know I will be offered H. I'm pretty confident I won't go down that road but I'm hoping I got what I needed from opiates when that time happens and I'm just done with them. It's either I quit then, find another source for legit pills (which is probably not going to happen) or make my own opium. :-D I just am not going to cross into heroin territory. It's not something I take lightly especially after seeing friends destroy their lives on it. One of my friends comes from a pretty wealthy family and he told me one year he literally shot a million dollars worth of dope in his veins. There went his trust fund. Is that even possible a million dollars in one year? I hope he was exaggerating.",1512404501.0
