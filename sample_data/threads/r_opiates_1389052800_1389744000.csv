The first bag I picked up was supposed to be a bundle but then it turned into a half gram for 120. When I got it it looked off and when I got it home it was complete shit. Being the fiend that I am I still tried to dissolve and shoot it, but it barely dissolved. Then because it\'s so dry around here I had to hit up the same person. They promised to get me back for the one before and set me up right but their second stuff weighed out to be like .3 not a half g and it had a lot of cut. So then I try my other friend who acted like he was getting pure straight from afghanistan, saying things like ""promise me you\'ll only do one point"". Then when he hands me the bag its like a little point bag and I\'m like dude this looks like one point and he\'s like no it\'s a half g. Anyways I weigh it out and it\'s only .13. So over the last two weeks I\'ve spent $450 on what was supposed to be 1.5 grams and instead I\'ve barely got three decent points. I live close to [city] but my license is suspended until June and as a white dude I feel like I\'ll just get robbed if I try to cold cop, that or busted by a cop trying to sell to me. To make things worse I have almost constant stomach pain that only cannabis or opiates can help. I\'ve seen specialists and they diagnosed me with IBS and basically apologized for not being able to do anything. I\'m always dealing with this grumbling pain that seems to only be alleviated with either of those two drugs. I was only picking up weed but I tried the H because it\'s way cheaper when I score real points. I\'ve been using opiates since I was 15 (I\'m 23). I started a dispensary in southern california but between hassles with landlords and my business partner getting too involved in H I had to move back to VA. I also had a full ride scholarship to Uni but I couldn\'t focus because of the pain and again no doctors have taken me seriously. The few times I\'ve talked to a doctor about this pain I feel like they judge me to be an addict and don\'t give me any help. My uncle had a problem with oxycontin and my dad is terrified of pain medicine and would flip even when I got percoset to recover from surgery. So basically I\'m in pain but can\'t get help because the doctors want to sell me BS physical therapy (aka bill more hours) and not give me the medicine I need. I can\'t score without being robbed up the ass. I\'m really coming to the end of my rope. I\'m thinking fuck it and move to afghanistan or mexico where I can get decent dope and not live constantly in pain. I might still get robbed but at least there I can hunt down the thieves myself instead of sitting around like a tool.

If you hate it, downvote it and move along please. K. I've had a 4 month and 1 week habit that started with vicodin and ended with dilaudid, oxycodone, and oxymorphone. Friday night was the last time I had anything. It wasn't a whole lot. Basically enough to keep me from w/d. Well Saturday I cut up a sub strip into 8 and had one piece. Then I decided I was just gonna get the w/d over with. Ride it strait through hell. Sunday was extremely uncomfortable. So cold, so hot. I took 6mg immodium, but seeing as I take prilosec, I thought I shouldn't take much because of the ability of PPIs to aid lopes ability to stay on the fun side of the BBB. Look it up if you don't believe me. (Lope passes the BBB but is immediately removed by P-glycoproteins, which are somewhat inhibited by PPIs like prilosec.) Anyways, Monday was still uncomfortable, but Tuesday I started to feel better. Wednesday I was completely better. The only issue I still had was sleep, solved by Xanax and Ambien. Yesterday I would say I was 95% better. No anxiety. I had some energy. I could FEEL! I was laughing finally. I just think I went through the W/D quick. I have a SLOW metabolism, too. I also think I only had the runs like 8 times, if that. So the question is, after detoxing so rapidly, is it ok to take something? I have 80mg hydrocodone from when I stopped taking it because it didn't do shit. Would I feel anything from taking a little? Just to satisfy my mental cravings. Also, I'm pretty sure it won't, but would it send me into withdrawals if I take some today and today only. I have other types of things that will stop my urges in case I crave tomorrow. Thanks guys. Sorry for the long post.\nTL;DR Been a week since last dose. Had mild W/D for a few days. Will I feel anything from a weaker opiate than I'm used to 7 days after a stronger one and will I go into W/D again from just one fun day.\n\nEdit: It might be good to add that towards the end, I was working on lowering tolerance, and 45mg oxy would get me ripped.

Well, that hasnt been an issue now for about 4 months, I\'ve had the most steady and awesome connect of good, cheap dope you could ever want. He\'s even been fronting me grams to sell in the next town over, and giving me dope to do it, so essentially for the last month or so i\'ve been MAKING money to do about a half a day. But of course all good things come to an end, as of yesterday my guy just stopped responding to me out of nowhere, his phone is still on but he just wont answer me and I have no idea why. He isnt showing up in the arrest records and I drove by his house yesterday and his car was there with the lights on. So of course, now begins the process of dope taking away all that it has given me the past few months. I do not feel good at all and have been scrambling to find some subs or dope, with no luck so far. It has been so long since I\'ve been in this situation, but at the same time it is all too familiar.\n\nAs a funny story, the dope that i usually get is white, it looks basically like coke, but its decent H. Well my dude also sells crack, or ""work"" as the kids call it these days. The other day i go to pick up my usual 3 grams to sell, and i do a line on the way to sell it. Right away i know something is wrong...it looks the same basically, but it tastes like coke. For some reason i just assume it was new dope that was cut with coke and go to sell it anyway. Well after selling it I do a fat line because i wasnt feeling anything off the first one and....yep, thats crack. I had never done crack before and i did damn near a half G of it, and sold it to my to be sold in tenths to others. I was freaking out, but first I had to hit up my other guy and get a legit half of dope to calm my ass down. My dude ends up realizing his mistake and we bring him back around 1.5 grams of the work (minus what i did and what my guy sold to unlucky junkies that shot up crack...i do feel bad but it was an honest mistake on everyone\'s part) and he just hands me the 3 grams of dope I originally wanted at a discount. So we had a good laugh about that.\n\nBut I aint laughing now. Inexplicably, I cant get ahold of my main dude or my secondary guy, they just wont answer..and I have no idea what to do. Might end up buying some lope tonight which i havent fucked with in months, but its nice to know that options there. The worst part of all this is I went to Florida with my family over christmas, was gone for 9 days, and took 5 subs with me and was sober for 9 days. And I made the decision to buy dope again after a full week of telling myself I could just walk away, the hard part was over. But I didnt, I have been doing a half or more a day for 10 days now and am sick as a dog, with money to burn but no one will answer the phone. C\'est la vie when you\'re a junkie. Anyway, I hope everyone else is nice and warm and has a nod going, and I hope this doesnt sound too whiny.

I heard everything from ""man i could have a new bmw with all that money i spent"" to even ""shit i could have bought a fucking house with house much i spent"". Well the other day and a few friends were smoking a blunt and this topic came up. 10k, 20k, 50k, etc. Thinking about it not many addicts make that much legitimately so everyone has their hustles whether its robbing, shoplifting, panhandling, whatever you name it weve done it. The point is most of that absurb amount of money youve spent on dope, you wouldnt have in the first place if you werent addicted. I mean how many people shoplift, return stolen items, stick up dealers/addicts, or go car hoping because they are saving for college or making mortgage payments? Just a thought for anyone whos feeling depressed about the financial aspect of this shit. Its no doubt still a problem for all of us but hopefully thinking about it this way wont make it seem as bad.

However, I would just like to mention that i feel like the derision of kratom is somewhat unjustified. I\'ve felt better on a good strong dose of kratom than I\'ve had on 50 mg of hydro or even slightly smaller doses of oxy. At the same time, yes, the kratom withdrawals are weaker but definitely still fucking withdrawals. I recently stopped a pretty heavy habit for about 5 months and went through hell: sleeplessness, achyness, depression, boredom, complete loss of appetite, nauseau and just general unpleasantness. I also get awful cravings that I still don\'t really know how to conduct myself with. And yes, I know it\'s not as bad as withdrawals from oxy and others and bla bla bla, but honestly it\'s still very, very real. I guess I\'m trying to communicate with y\'all that the mention of someone\'s DOC being kratom shouldnt bring us to mock or ignore, and just generally be respectful of each others habits and potentially lower tolerances, even if it\'s with something weaker like kratom.

In my neck of the woods heroin is rare. It\'s a great cause of despair for me every day. I yearn, I bleed, I torture myself all day with the want and the pain that my psychological addiction causes me. So I replace, or rather distract myself, from my addiction with literature and prose that understands the place that I\'m in. \n\nI was sober for 14 weeks. That\'s hard to believe, considering the place I\'m in now. I fell in love with a reformed addict. More accurately, I fell in love with the dopamine he gave me. As soon as I went sober, I replaced my drugs with him. And as soon as it ended, 14 weeks later, I replaced his dopamine with my DOC of heroin. It\'s hard to find, and after only a week-long bender I was high and dry. To deal with the withdrawals, I immersed myself in the endless delights of Ambien. I saved my script all month and it still only lasted me three days. I latched onto that. Ambien was my crutch. Once it was gone, and I was left completely drugless and still withdrawing mildly, I started going to NA meetings. It was the only thing that made me feel better. When I went home for Christmas break, I started a Xanax binge that gave my mother the reason she needed to kick me out of the house. The next few days were all a blur, with couchsurfing with friends and dosing on Kratom just to get some sleep. This week or two past I\'ve been loading up on uppers and calming down with alcohol. The only thing keeping me positive is the fact that I\'ll be leaving this Godforsaken town in a matter of days and returning to pursue my education. At the moment I\'m numb-faced and giddy from a few lines of coke and a few shots of gin (not my favorite, but in times of need anything\'ll do). \n\n""My day in the light, the day is darkening. I\'m hurling all the little joys against the greater sadness. The sadness is a giant weight. It presses down. Its meaning: ""What\'s the point?"" The little joys are pebbles. The pebbles are getting smaller and smaller and the weight of the sadness is growing, the sadness is gaining density and mass, until in the end I\'m throwing handfuls of dust at matter so thick there\'s no spaces between the molecules. Nowhere anywhere for anything to move. The years roll on. I can\'t stop. I just can\'t stop. I can\'t stop anymore."" -Luke Davies, *Candy*\n\nThere seems to be a bit of a drought in my area at the moment. Does anyone else take almost anything in the absence of heroin because anything is better than being completely sober? I\'ve been on an upper binge, which makes no sense because I hate uppers. But I\'ll take anything. Coke, Adderall, I even (accidentally, if you can believe it) took meth. \n\n""Now as soon as they had tasted the honey-sweet fruit of the lotus, they wished for nothing better than to stay where they were, living with the folk of that country and feeding on the lotus.

I\'m 2 days into WD and there\'s no sign of it letting up soon.\n\n So I figured I\'d use what little energy I have left in my hands to make a post and get my mind off of this horrible feeling. Just putting this out here now, this will be a pretty extensive post, so mind the TL;DR at the end if interested. This post is going to be of my climb up to a king and the downfall, which i\'m now hellishly basking in.\n\nI knew about dope for a long time, a best friend of mine got addicted when we were both like 17, his girlfriend got a bunch of money from her father dying and was using all of it to buy massive amounts of dope, crack, coke, anything really. I watched my best friend descend into this dark, scary place that I really didn\'t like seeing him in, and it somehow reached out to me, trying to pull me in as well. He was always shooting up, he stopped hanging out with me, and would only hang out with me after he had shot up. This had really bothered me at the time, seeing as how I felt like I wasn\'t good enough to hang out with unless he was drugged up. He soon after ended up getting kicked out of his parents and going to rehab. \n\nI had a pact with myself to never do hard drugs, but I also had this same pact with any other substance that I was currently abusing at the time at some point. I was more of an alcoholic than anything, drinking large amounts of straight everclear, I also had a bad pill problem, anything and everything I could find, I either snorted or just straight downed. I was binging for days at a time drinking alcohol, snorting upwards of 120mg of adderall a day, I was also a stoner, smoking weed helplessly all the time and on top of that abusing DXM consistently, sometimes daily throughout a week taking upwards of 1g at a time of DXM (I never realized how bad dxm was for me until it was too late). \n\nEveryone always looked up to me in high school and I don\'t know why, everyone respected me and always praised my attention, and I was just a junkie, trying to get a fix from anything and everything that I could, no one knew that, at least, the people who did didn\'t know how bad it actually was. People just assumed that I was a teenager trying to have fun, however it\'s always been much more than that. \n\n(skip forward about 2-3 years)\n\nEverything was perfect, I had a job making $11, it was a loose job too, I only ""had"" to work 3 hours a day, but I could pick up as many extra hours as I wanted, i\'m only 19 years old with no college history as of yet, so this was a fairly decent prospect for me. I got myself my first apartment with some room mates on a campus area in my hometown, I lived on the 4th story of an apartment building. At this point I had noticed that a lot of my friends were starting to get into dope, my original friend at the time had not been in it as much anymore, only chipping and he\'s still doing a fine job at keeping it under control. Being back in the city gave me the advantage of being around all of my close friends again. I kept seeing dope come around my house because I never minded it, I had come to accept it as something that was going to be around, and I was just purely okay with it.\n\nI was always so interested in it, watching people do it and the way they acted afterwards, how they felt, I was drawn to it more and more. (I was suffering from some pretty bad anxiety/panic disorder at the time from my dxm use and thought maybe that dope could help me with my anxiety, fear of death etc.) I eventually tried it for the first time.\n\nA friend of mine came over with a half gram of this legendary purplish blue dope that was going around at the time, this dope was probably the most delicious thing that I\'ve ever tasted, the best dope I\'ve ever had no doubt. He warned me, he wanted me to try it out because I had an interest but said not to do too much. So he broke me off a half a tenth to work with for my first night. I started off doing .02 of a point. I had no interest in shooting it at the time, just wanted to snort it and see where it took me.\n\nImmediately after snorting it, I stood up, and walked out onto my 4th story balcony. As I felt the warm tingling sensation enshroud my entire body from the back of my head, going down my neck all the way to the base of my spine, and then the pure bliss that followed, it seemed like some kind of miracle, this couldn\'t be this drug, it was so amazing, such an amazing experience, all the pain I\'d ever experienced was gone, I was a cloud, no, I was the sun shining through the grey-black clouds after a hellish storm, the first light of hope. As I stood there looking over this gorgeous nature preserve park right across the road, I felt the sun\'s beams glare off of my skin, I have never felt a more orgasmic experience. The warmth of the sun on my skin, and the cool breeze blowing through my hair. I took a deep breath in and felt alive, for the first time in months, years. After this, I continued using dope sparingly, getting a bag here and there when I threw a party or had a group of friends coming over. I loved this substance, and was becoming more attached to it, and didn\'t think anything of it. It took all my pain away, I was finally happy for once.\n\nI was only in that apartment for a summer sublease, so I had to move out last august, and find a new place to stay, I ended up moving across town to a new house, that would be my new home leading up until just a few days ago. After moving into this new house, I immediately ended up spending a lot less money on costs as previously required due to the rent being lower and utilities being included, i fell into a lot more spending money which was nice. I started selling out of my new house, D and weed mainly. I had a good friend of mine who was giving me straight qps and hps of some medical imported from colorado. I was making thousands of dollars a day and reinvesting into my sales, buying nearly a hp a day and 2 grams of some decent dope. \nSince I was making so much money, I quit my job (Bad decision)\n\nI was selling to a lot of close friends of mine when it came to dope, I slowly started falling into it more and more as I kept selling, I went from doing 1 point a day, to 3 points, and then even half grams a day, I never started shooting though, I\'ve never wanted to shoot, as I\'d seen how it changed all of my friends, I saw all of my friends who use to snort, start shooting it, and they never went back, and they started selling all of their things to get more money to buy dope from me.\n\n I felt bad, seeing this happen to my friends so they could give me their money, so I would give them free batches here and there to keep them at bay a while longer. Without me even knowing, I was addicted to dope bad. Since I always had dope, I never had to worry about being sick, for months, I never went a day without dope for basically half a year. And then one day, the money ran out, I hit the bottom of my stash, people got arrested, connects were lost, and it left me with nothing. After getting fucked over on a few bad batches of d, I was left with no money. Nothing. All of the people who I thought were my friends, the people I let stay in my house for free, the people I gave free drugs too, the people I gave free food, etc. No one was there to help me. After the first 20 hours of not having dope is when I realized, I was beginning WD, I had stomach cramps that felt as though a thousand knives were passing through my intestines, a head ache that any split sound could throw over the edge, all of the typical symptoms that I\'m sure any other unfortunate soul on here has experienced. 2 days into my WD, I fell into a little bit of money and bought myself a half point off of a friend, It was some decent black/brownish rock that I was able to make last me the rest of the day only taking bumps when needed.  \n\nAside from how horrible I felt, everyone kept telling me how lucky I was, something about how since I never shot up, I never got the withdrawals the same, apparently snorting wd and shooting wd are extremely different, I couldn\'t bother to care much at the time because the people would unload their bags into their spoons right in front of me, and i\'d watch them put the needle into their arms and drift back into a cloud. Right in front of my face when I was beyond sick. I wanted that same pleasure again. I had to move all of my stuff out of my old house into my new apartment the other day, where I\'m staying now. I had to do all of this while sick, Lifting couches, beds, bagging shit up, it was horrible, trying to pull energy out of you that you don\'t even have. Where I\'m staying at now, it\'s kind of difficult to come across dope, I\'m not going to be coming into any more money until tax season most likely as I\'ll be getting my tax return and then some money back that my mom owes me. I just got 2 bags the other night, it lasted me 2 days, it kept the sickness away, that\'s all i\'ve wanted, was to feel normal again. \n\nNow I\'m sitting here, on the edge of my bed, hunched over my computer, zoning out, wishing some magical person could come by and give me a bump, something to get me off my feet.\n\nTL;DR: I knew a friend who did dope, it got me interested eventually. I started doing it and loved it. Started selling dope and weed eventually going through 2gs+ a day snorting a hg to myself usually and hp\'s of weed, I was making thousands. Everything fell apart, lost my house, a lot of my friends, all of my money, now I\'m sick and living far away from any dope.\n\nI understand this was a pretty long post, and I apologize, I just figured i\'d share my story, and get my mind occupied for a while before I go back to laying in every uncomfortable position back on my bed.\n\nHope you all enjoy your day, and stay warm. \n\nPeace and Love.'",1389219566.0

The syrup I have contains 10mg Codeine and 100mg of Guifenisen per 5mL. How much Guifenisen is a typical ""puking"" point, or does it vary from person to person? I seem to have an immunity to guifenisen, seeing as how I just ingested 1200mg. But I\'ll go higher if it\'s safe. \n\nAnd finally, is it even possible to nod off to on codeine?

He lived just ten minutes from the city, though still a 50 minute drive from my small town. The bundles back home were $80-$90 for inconsistent dope from flaky dealers. His impressive amount of connects and $50 bundles were attractive enough for him to become my main source. \n\nThe deal was that every time I picked up through him I had to give him 50% of my dope up to a bundle, passed that it was all mine. Most of his dealers didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind selling singles but they all had their one bun minimum. The cut for him was the same whether buying one bundle or ten, and with the size of his habit it seemed reasonably fair. The argument arose when I had only $50 and didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to split the bundle 50-50. \n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t like my fucking tax how about your drive your ass down to the corner of Appleton and Elm where the Cops sit and the dope\xe2\x80\x99s half as good. Your $50 would get you less of a high then splitting this one with me. It took me two years working my way up connects until I finally worked my way up to this quality,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained to me . \n\nI was only trying to go 60-40 with him this one time but he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t budge. He remained my middleman for the next couple weeks but the seed had been planted in my mind was growing. If he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t named the specific street corner then he might still be taxing me today, but he was pissed and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he considered that I would actually do it. \n\nTwo weeks after the argument I was having trouble meeting up with him. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what was going on but he kept giving me the run around during the day and finally answering at night saying we were all set for tomorrow. I\xe2\x80\x99d call the next day only to be hit with the same games. I put up with this the first two days but on the third day when I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get a hold of him I had had enough. I plugged Appleton and Elm street into my phone\xe2\x80\x99s GPS and headed off unsure of what to expect.\n\nAn hour later I arrived in the small city (pop. under 150,000) which was considered by most people \xe2\x80\x9cin the know\xe2\x80\x9d to be the heroin capital of the state. There were a handful of far bigger cities but none boasted the reputation of this one in particular. Per capita it was unquestionably the \xe2\x80\x9cdirtiest\xe2\x80\x9d city in the state, probably the whole region. \n\nThe signs of dope were everywhere from the mattresses in the alleyways to the no loitering signs which were as common as street signs. The most obvious and impossible to ignore was the drug paraphernalia which littered the city. I joked to a friend that if you\xe2\x80\x99re looking to score its just a matter of pulling a ghetto version of Hensel and Grettel; just follow the needle caps and empty bags instead of pieces of candy and you\xe2\x80\x99ll be heading home in no time.\n\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know that then though. I had no clue just how prevalent the heroin scene was and I thought without my little address I would have been hopeless. When I\xe2\x80\x99d pick-up with my middleman Peroin we didn\xe2\x80\x99t head towards the downtown area but kept to the outskirts where his connects were plenty and the risk much lower. I was surprised when I was still blocks from my  \ndestination to be getting down-right stared at by people hanging on corners and in front of bodegas. I had a feeling they could help me out but I decided to just see what was awaiting me at my destination. I park a block away and walk to the corner. I saw either a black or spanish teenager hanging out of all three entryways to the rundown section-8 housing building that stood at the corner. I was floored when they each asked me variations of one question - \xe2\x80\x9cWhat ya need?\xe2\x80\x9d \n\nI was weary of buying inferior product and wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure if the $50 price I was used to would hold but I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so dumb as to not at least pretend to know that that was the price everywhere. It seemed like it could be - $50, 10 bags, $5 a piece it sure made sense. So I went up to one of the dope boys, stepped inside with him, and told him I would buy 4 bags now and come back and get 6 more if it was good. He said fine and I handed him a twenty as he handed me the four bags with a Coca-Cola stamp on them.\n\nI was in disbelief at how easy that was and quickly realized that if the dope\xe2\x80\x99s straight my main worry will be the police. I had asked for a number but he said they don\xe2\x80\x99t really use phones, just that someone will always be there. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t about to bring up the police so I figured I could worry about that later. I got back to my car and found a safe place to get high. Peroin was partly right, the dope wasn\xe2\x80\x99t as good, but it was much closer than I expected, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been happier when I returned and bought the last 6 bags and it was the same product as the first four, I was a little worried he\xe2\x80\x99s screw me on the last 6.\n\nI figured Peroin must have been lying about taking him two years before being so well connected, I had only hit one spot and already had dope that was %80 as good, I mean some of these dudes must have phones and I can just get a number next time. I felt bad for Peroin in a way, his habit was out of control and considering I often pooled other kid\xe2\x80\x99s money and scored through him multiple times a week he would be out around 35-40 bags a week. That\xe2\x80\x99s the game for ya.\n\nI felt such a rush, not even from the drugs, but just the knowledge that I only needed money now, no word from a dealer, and I could score whenever. I would later regret not just being able to delete a number in my phone and rid myself of ways to get high. Once you know you can cold-cop its an ever-present temptation. Its similiar to russian roulette with a 100 chamber gun and a bullet, there was a risk but it usually worked out. It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be long before my new way to get dope would take its toll on my life.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBit of an underwhelming follow up imo. I wrote this today, I realize there isn't much of a climax to the story and I'll keep that in mind when I write my next one. Thanks for reading!""",1389493264.0

I will admit that a few of those times were during withdrawals, however any stress whatsoever flairs my crohns up. Right now I am in a situation where my pain managment doc sees me every two weeks. I was getting 4mg dillies 6 times a day then we went down to 5, then 4 a week ago. Im already out of those. It seems I go a week on and a week off. I live with family in an amazing house and they are jsut always there for me, but they dont really know whats going on. All of the bruises on my arms and hands I get to blame on being in the hospital and stuck to much. Last time I went in, over Christmas my mom came to the emergency room with me. They couldn't find anything, hit my arms, hands, feet, neck..They ended up have to draw blood from my femoral artery. Thank god no one saw the bruises on my thighs, those would be kind of unexplainable, though I do use Humira and IM into my thigh..I tell my parents Im doing fine! and suck it up to go visit my three nieces. I love them to death but so much noise and crying comes from a 3 years old and two 1 year old twins. When going throug w/ds im sure some of you know what I mean. I just got insurance through obama care which is great. I ask the rents if I could go talk to someone now and they are completely down with that. Part of me thinks they know whats going on. My mom found a syringe once and many many orange caps. I told here it was from the time i got sent home with Insulin from being on prednisone for so long, steroid induced diabetes. They know for a fact I have had issues with pain meds in the past and originally moved here on subs, but frequent flareups put me back on the dialudid which is really the only thing that works besides stronger stuff. I have been on it all, fro codeine, to percs, opana, fent, whatever, all prescribed. Some would call that a blessing but here I am on a saturday and I dont get to see my doc till next friday.

I love taking aerosol methamphetamine, IV morphine, 2C series research chems, and fictional super drugs and then blowing like five people to bits in the sand, with accompanying psychedelic visuals.  The other day I went to some camp full of doctors in the ghetto and I got loaded on chems, pulled out a rifle, and started blasting peoples' brains out, while my character was tripping and hallucinating.  At one point I blasted some bitch with my shotgun, then walked over her and blew her head open right as my character experienced a color shift, changing her blood and brains from red to blue, then yellow and back to an extremely bright red.  Then I shot some kid outside the gates and started eating the flesh where his head got blown off his shoulders.  \n\nI also like chopping people to pieces with the chainsaw and scattering their body parts across the room.  What do you guys like to do when you're high?""",1389469468.0

Long time lurker here, finally decided to make an account, and figured after all the knowledge, experience and entertainment I've got from you guys, it is my turn to contribute something. \n\nFirst off anyone who says PST is a waste of time, is wrong. I'm from Minneapolis and have a pretty decent tolerance to tar and all opiates. But being as I can only get those when i'm back in the cities, and go to school at Iowa State, I've been continuing my favorite habit and activity using the only source I can get down here - PST. I've been doing this for 4 years now, and have tried every method possible. I know it's been said before and I'm just going to reiterate that the best method is the most simple one.\n\nI need about 800 grams of good seeds to be high for a day, if you want to know more about the effects let me know and i'll share. \n\n800grams is TOO much for a normal 2 liter. At the dollar store they sell crap 2.5 liters of pop which are perfect. Weigh out your seeds on a food scale and use a funnel to get the into the 2.5 liter. Next add just enough water so you can shake it around and it's not sludgy and everything is flowing. I've tried adding lemon, and all the other addities mentioned and nothing really enhances the absorption.The best way to get the most out of them is to not let the water sit and be absorbed. As soon as the water is in the bottle violently shake it for about 3-4 minutes.  That's all you need, no more. As soon as you're done shaking untwist the cap half way so it doesn't come off but lets water out and squeeze it all out into a cup. I use a beer mug and it's perfect. I don't mind the taste, but most times I will still chase it a little bit with the soda that comes out of the 2.5 liter so It doesn't go to complete waste.  If you drink this on an empty stomache you should feel the effects within 10 minutes. I always add more water and do a second wash, but find that a third is completely unnecessary. \n\nIf anyone has any questions relating to tolerance, effects, combinations with benzo's, anything like that please let me know! Like I said it's not my preferred opiate, but being down in Iowa for school it's all I have and I much prefer it to something like hydrocodone. \n""",1389467090.0

Super long, maybe not super interesting.'","b'  I wake up to my iphone vibrating on my bed squealing a sound I hate more than the waking up itself. I reach over and touch the snooze box. Next thing I know I am rolling out of bed and its 9am, 1 hour late for work. ""Shit"" I think to myself. Call the boss and tell him ill be late as I light my first cigarette of the day. If you dont count the 3 I nodded out with in the wee hours of the morning that is.. I scramble to the kitchen to see whats left of my dope. ""Fuck"" I whisper under my breathe. A couple lines. I decide to have a shower before I indulge. The shower is warm, for a moment im not thinking about dope, im happy, I have always loved water. When I was younger I would spend hours swimming in the lake at my grammas cabin. Seems like a lifetime ago. To think of a time when I didnt need drugs to enjoy myself. Sometimes I dont even think im addicted to dope itself. Im addicted to getting high. Im addicted to not being myself. I dont like myself. I dry off quickly and start getting dressed. Slip my silver diamond studded Bulova watch on my wrist while untangling my gold chain atop the dresser. Grab a dirty polo sweater off the floor and and run my hand through my damp hair. ""Fuck this"" I think as I pack my one hitter with some low quality weed. I remember I have a red bull in the fridge. Thatll help. I crack it and take a gulp. By this time I cant imagine not snorting some of that powder. I pour it all out disappointed at the amount in front me. For a brief second I swear under my breathe at my friend who fucked me over last night. I went all the way downtown to give HIS buddy the money I owed him. He promised his buddy would have a half gram for me on front. When i get there the guy is 20 minutes away (of course). I wait. When he finally shows up hes not holding. Said he was never told about any half grams. I call my buddy who then loses his shit saying hes sleeping. I almost break down in fucking tears. Fucking tears knowing I wont have enough to get me through work tomorrow. Aaand Im back to today... I do my line and feel 1/10th better about life. Better enough to slip on my italian leather loafers and hit the command start to my new car. They call me a functioning addict. I call myself a broken piece of society. I am better than you, average person. When I am high, I am empathetic, caring, funny, confident, I care. Some people use dope not to feel, I use it to feel. When I am sober im cold. I am not a good person. Dope makes me feel, makes me love. Dope Makes me human. When im not high I am nothing. My car means nothing. My job with chances to make thousands in a day means nothing. My clothes mean nothing. That man on the street freezing asking for a dollar for coffee means nothing. They have the audacity to use functioning to define me? I function like an old car on the brink of its last Mile. Burning fuel till it needs to be filled. I burn my bridges and snort my dope, till the dope needs to be refilled and the bridges rebuilt. One of those two things just doesn\'t happen after a while... And i ALWAYS refill my dope. \n\n\nI really have always loved writing and want to write a short story about my life and shit. This is actually just how my day went though and im curious what you guys think? If i wrote a story would it be complete garbage? '",1389463638.0

I pass what feels like the millionth car ignoring the speed limit signs which fellow citizens at least pretend to adhere to with their 75 mile an hour speed. Every second brings me closer. It sure doesn\xe2\x80\x99t feel that way though. My mind recognizes only one thing; high and not high.\n\t\nI know where the cops sit and force myself to slow down when making those few turns on what has been nicknamed the heroin highway, but then again what stretch of highway doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hold that nickname these days. I\xe2\x80\x99ve made this drive well over a hundred times this year and have been incredibly lucky to have only been pulled over once. \n\nMy wellness balances on the half-life of the last heroin I shot over half a day ago, its a balance that is more science than art regardless of what the chic dope users spew about in their countless journals and stories. I am no different. \n           \nI\xe2\x80\x99m at the point where there is no such thing as peace within my body, just an urge greater than any non-addict has ever known. The sun is bright. The brightness pounds into my cornea compounding the headache I\xe2\x80\x99ve had since tossing and turning in bed this morning. I turn the radio down, there is no such thing as distraction at this point. There is only the pot of gold at the end of my self-imposed rainbow, its black cauldron holding under a gram in weight of my chosen relief, no gold, no leprechaun, just the beige powder that calls millions of names every waking second of every fucking day.\n\nI finally am within a mile of the exit and frantically search for the ticket that the kind toll booth lady hands me every other day. She knows my unshaven face and bedhead as well as I know her judging eyes. She must knows what\xe2\x80\x99s up, but there isn\xe2\x80\x99t any possible way for me to give less of a shit about what she thinks. Finally I find it underneath my seat as I count out the dimes and nickels which will save me from my 29th fourty dollar ticket for blowing through the speed pass.\n\nI call my dealer to let him know that I am ten minutes away. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t answer my call which pisses me off although there could be a thousand legitimate reasons which stem from his otherwise normal life. He works a 40 hour week but capitalizes on the thousand of white folk from the neighboring area that flock to the city he grew up in seek of relief. His green Lexus symbolizing the money I hand him whenever I have the opportunity.\n\nI am finally within a mile of his house when he calls me back. He tells me to meet him at his secondary spot, the one I passed five miles ago. I tell him I\xe2\x80\x99ll be there in five minutes wishing for just one day our positions could be switched. Him relying on me and knowing what its like to have his heart skip a beat when he sees my name on his caller ID. Him looking like shit 90% of the time we see each other instead of in his expensive urban wear. Him counting the dollars he scrounged up before I hand him his goods at a 100% mark-up. There\xe2\x80\x99s no reason for me to wish ill on him as he\xe2\x80\x99s been as good as can be to a client, which is what he calls me, even though we both know he says feigned when I\xe2\x80\x99m not around.\n \nI pull into the parking lot on the outskirts of the city. Its a great place to meet in the summer. Fences with thick vines surround the parking lot, one of his few girlfriends live here. I wonder if she knows how much of that necklace that she wears has been funded by me. I\xe2\x80\x99m being stupid though, of course she knows what\xe2\x80\x99s up, she did meet me that one time handing me my bundles as I momentarily forget about my sickness enchanted by her light brown skin and thick lips. She was friendly and I could see the momentary sadness in her eyes, knowing that most of the luxury in her life comes from the decay in my own life.\n\nHe pulls in a minute later and comes up to the window. This is his territory, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t fear the police. He makes a thousand a week, maybe two thousand on a good week through his secondary \xe2\x80\x9cjob,\xe2\x80\x9d but he is picky on who he serves. The stamp is the same as its been for the past three months, just how this day is the same thing everytime except for when I\xe2\x80\x99m short a few dollars and have to be extra nice. He knows it makes no difference to him, the three dollars here or four dollars there, but still has to play his position and always lets me know to not make a habit of it, which I don\xe2\x80\x99t. Many times I\xe2\x80\x99ve had to ask strangers for a dollar or two for gas to get me home not wanting to be short with my man twice in a row.\n\nI pull out of the parking lot knowing that I could never make it home before getting high. I\xe2\x80\x99ve played this game in this part of the city long enough to know where the best spots to go are. I drive two miles down the road and pull into one of the nicer apartment parking lots with its trees and bushes where I can park my car besides keeping me as inconspicuous as possible.\n\nI tear open my new pack of needles and pull my kit outta my backpack. I\xe2\x80\x99m just a minute or two away now and I have to focus to steady my hand. I split the tape which keeps every nickel sized bag of dope together. Once the bags are split I line them up together completely unfolded, tearing off the top of seven bags simultaneously. I empty each one out into my cooker admiring the beige color of them. Next I draw the 40 units I need into my syringe being more exact then is necessary. \n\nThe water mixes with the dope devouring the powder so instantaneously that I need to stir it but once before it is ready. I open my pack of Camels and pull out a cigarette, tearing off a tiny piece of the filter which I roll in between my fingers before dropping it into the brown liquid of relief. I push the point of the needle into the cotton and draw up every bit of the substance that I can.\n\nI pull my arm out of the long sleeved shirt I\xe2\x80\x99m wearing and bring my arm out from the bottom of the shirt. I wrap the sleeve around my bicep while pumping my fist, thankful that my veins haven\xe2\x80\x99t given out yet. I hit a vein within a minute and finally relax when I see the red mushroom cloud entering the chamber. I push down on the plunger and quickly pull the needle out of my arm where a single drop of blood pools at the surface. I turn the radio backup and get lucky when a song I like comes on. \n\nIts been thirty seconds and I suddenly feel what I drove here for, the pins and needles start in my fingertips and toes working their way up my body to my lips.

I have been experimenting with various drugs for about 2 years. The first drug I ever tried was alchohol I found it enjoyable and fun, but it was exactly what I was looking for in a drug so I kept experimenting. Next up I tried smoking weed and liked it a lot and found it to be better than alcohol but it still felt like something was missing. I ended up breaking my arm about 8 months ago and that night they put me on a morphine iv and I have never felt better in my life. I layed in my hospital bed completely painless and I felt like everything was how it should be. I normally am a somewhat shy person but I was talkative and felt like I was connecting with everyone that I spoke to. In my opinion when I am on opiates I am happier and I feel like I am living up to my potential when I am high. Opiates are no doubt my drug of choice,they make me feel complete and help me overcome the things that I dislike about myself. I have abused various pain medications that go from codeine hydrocodone oxycodone dilaudid and fentanyl since then and I have loved every single one. But lately I have begun to worry I have read so many posts about people who feel hopeless and feel like they don't feel emotions like they used to. That they feel numb and unhappy without opiates. I have the rest of my life ahead of me I am only nineteen years old but I would like to have opiates in my life for the rest of my life. Opiates are the perfect drug for me it's like the chemicals combine perfectly with my body chemistry and personality. I don't want to live without opiates but I don't want them to lose the magic they have to me. I have been on a few long binges that have ended with horrible withdrawals but I didn't care. I want to chip on opiates for the rest of my life but chipping seems impossible eventually. From all the posts I've read people always fail at chipping. I need advice I want to keep doing opiates but I am clean at the moment and I am at a crossroads. Do I go back to using and try to chip or should I walk away now and live life without a dependence on opiates thanks for reading I hope you can help me figure out what to do.""",1389401253.0

Kurt suicide note.',"b""To Boddah\nSpeaking from the tongue of an experienced simpleton who obviously would rather be an emasculated, infantile complain-ee. This note should be pretty easy to understand. All the warnings from the punk rock 101 courses over the years, since my first introduction to the, shall we say, ethics involved with independence and the embracement of your community has proven to be very true. I haven't felt the excitement of listening to as well as creating music along with reading and writing for too many years now. I feel guity beyond words about these things. For example when we're back stage and the lights go out and the manic roar of the crowds begins., it doesn't affect me the way in which it did for Freddie Mercury, who seemed to love, relish in the the love and adoration from the crowd which is something I totally admire and envy. The fact is, I can't fool you, any one of you. It simply isn't fair to you or me. The worst crime I can think of would be to rip people off by faking it and pretending as if I'm having 100% fun. Sometimes I feel as if I should have a punch-in time clock before I walk out on stage. I've tried everything within my power to appreciate it (and I do,God, believe me I do, but it's not enough). I appreciate the fact that I and we have affected and entertained a lot of people. It must be one of those narcissists who only appreciate things when they're gone. I'm too sensitive. I need to be slightly numb in order to regain the enthusiasms I once had as a child. On our last 3 tours, I've had a much better appreciation for all the people I've known personally, and as fans of our music, but I still can't get over the frustration, the guilt and empathy I have for everyone. There's good in all of us and I think I simply love people too much, so much that it makes me feel too fucking sad. The sad little, sensitive, unappreciative, Pisces, Jesus man. Why don't you just enjoy it? I don't know! I have a goddess of a wife who sweats ambition and empathy and a daughter who reminds me too much of what I used to be, full of love and joy, kissing every person she meets because everyone is good and will do her no harm. And that terrifies me to the point to where I can barely function. I can't stand the thought of Frances becoming the miserable, self-destructive, death rocker that I've become. I have it good, very good, and I'm grateful, but since the age of seven, I've become hateful towards all humans in general. Only because it seems so easy for people to get along that have empathy. Only because I love and feel sorry for people too much I guess. Thank you all from the pit of my burning, nauseous stomach for your letters and concern during the past years. I'm too much of an erratic, moody baby! I don't have the passion anymore, and so remember, it's better to burn out than to fade away. Peace, love, empathy.

I heated the solution up and drew it up through a small cotton ball but the murkyness remained.\n\nSo what do you guys think?

To presume to point a man to the right and ultimate goal \xe2\x80\x94 to point with a trembling finger in the RIGHT direction is something only a fool would take upon himself. \xe2\x80\x9cTo be, or not to be: that is the question: Whether \xe2\x80\x99tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, or to take arms against a sea of troubles\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd indeed, that IS the question: whether to float with the tide, or to swim for a goal. It is a choice we must all make consciously or unconsciously at one time in our lives. So few people understand this! Think of any decision you\xe2\x80\x99ve ever made which had a bearing on your future: I may be wrong, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t see how it could have been anything but a choice however indirect \xe2\x80\x94 between the two things I\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned: the floating or the swimming.The answer \xe2\x80\x94 and, in a sense, the tragedy of life \xe2\x80\x94 is that we seek to understand the goal and not the man. We set up a goal which demands of us certain things: and we do these things. We adjust to the demands of a concept which CANNOT be valid. When you were young, let us say that you wanted to be a fireman. I feel reasonably safe in saying that you no longer want to be a fireman. Why? Because your perspective has changed. It\xe2\x80\x99s not the fireman who has changed, but you.Every man is the sum total of his reactions to experience. As your experiences differ and multiply, you become a different man, and hence your perspective changes. This goes on and on. Every reaction is a learning process; every significant experience alters your perspective.\n\nSo it would seem foolish, would it not, to adjust our lives to the demands of a goal we see from a different angle every day? How could we ever hope to accomplish anything other than galloping neurosis?\n\nThe answer, then, must not deal with goals at all, or not with tangible goals, anyway. It would take reams of paper to develop this subject to fulfillment. God only knows how many books have been written on \xe2\x80\x9cthe meaning of man\xe2\x80\x9d and that sort of thing, and god only knows how many people have pondered the subject. (I use the term \xe2\x80\x9cgod only knows\xe2\x80\x9d purely as an expression.)* There\xe2\x80\x99s very little sense in my trying to give it up to you in the proverbial nutshell, because I\xe2\x80\x99m the first to admit my absolute lack of qualifications for reducing the meaning of life to one or two paragraphs.To put our faith in tangible goals would seem to be, at best, unwise. So we do not strive to be firemen, we do not strive to be bankers, nor policemen, nor doctors. WE STRIVE TO BE OURSELVES.\n\nBut don\xe2\x80\x99t misunderstand me. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean that we can\xe2\x80\x99t BE firemen, bankers, or doctors\xe2\x80\x94but that we must make the goal conform to the individual, rather than make the individual conform to the goal. In every man, heredity and environment have combined to produce a creature of certain abilities and desires\xe2\x80\x94including a deeply ingrained need to function in such a way that his life will be MEANINGFUL. A man has to BE something; he has to matter.\n\nAs I see it then, the formula runs something like this: a man must choose a path which will let his ABILITIES function at maximum efficiency toward the gratification of his DESIRES. In doing this, he is fulfilling a need (giving himself identity by functioning in a set pattern toward a set goal) he avoids frustrating his potential (choosing a path which puts no limit on his self-development), and he avoids the terror of seeing his goal wilt or lose its charm as he draws closer to it (rather than bending himself to meet the demands of that which he seeks, he has bent his goal to conform to his own abilities and desires).\n\nIn short, he has not dedicated his life to reaching a pre-defined goal, but he has rather chosen a way of life he KNOWS he will enjoy. The goal is absolutely secondary: it is the functioning toward the goal which is important. And it seems almost ridiculous to say that a man MUST function in a pattern of his own choosing; for to let another man define your own goals is to give up one of the most meaningful aspects of life \xe2\x80\x94 the definitive act of will which makes a man an individualA man who procrastinates in his CHOOSING will inevitably have his choice made for him by circumstance. So if you now number yourself among the disenchanted, then you have no choice but to accept things as they are, or to seriously seek something else. But beware of looking for goals: look for a way of life. Decide how you want to live and then see what you can do to make a living WITHIN that way of life. But you say, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know where to look; I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to look for.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd there\xe2\x80\x99s the crux. Is it worth giving up what I have to look for something better? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\xe2\x80\x94is it? Who can make that decision but you? But even by DECIDING TO LOOK, you go a long way toward making the choice.I\xe2\x80\x99m not trying to send you out \xe2\x80\x9con the road\xe2\x80\x9d in search of Valhalla, but merely pointing out that it is not necessary to accept the choices handed down to you by life as you know it. There is more to it than that \xe2\x80\x94 no one HAS to do something he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to do for the rest of his life.\n\n\nTL;DR. Float or swim, either way choose, or the choice will be made for you.'",1389542805.0
