My family was scared shitless. All i remember is finishing the kratom tea after eating all those other drugs and the next 12 hours is blank.

I am currently withdrawing from roxys, (been using daily since august) and i am determined to turn my life around. I went to a narcotics anonymous meeting the other night and it was good. I just want to be happy again without using drugs. I want to be a better big brother for my younger siblings. I want them to look up to me rather than see me as the ""drug addicted loser older brother""
I lost some weight, haven't been able to sleep well in days, and haven't really had an appetite in days.
I want to stay clean off opiates for the rest of my life. My body is so used to having Roxy in my system in the morning, afternoon, and nighttime. I just want this vicious cycle to be over already!!
I spent half of my savings account on drugs from august to 4 days ago. ($100-120 a day habit). Not good at all.

Knowing that I had this stuff set aside provided me with an ever-present safety net of reassurance and security. No matter what the situation, unable to find more, afford more, main stash gets found and/or I get busted, etc, I would not have to worry about being empty handed for a long time. And that reassurance alone was like being wrapped in a secure, fuzzy blanket. 

But the more I looked at that baggie of dope the more I saw it as a leash. In fact, I think I had the whole safety net concept backwards: the net wasn't for me, it was for the drug. If I ever ran out and couldn't get more, that back up baggie was the net, the leash, that kept me close. 

If I didn't have it, I may be forced to withdraw and be clean. I would have to exist in the reality that living without dope is not only possible, but perhaps I may even like it enough to continue not using.

But having a back up stash means that I could/would keep using. As long as the dope kept me on its rope, the idea of being without it would only exist as a nightmare. Being CLEAN or SOBER, would seem terrifying. But as long as I had more junk, I would never have to worry about those words.

TL:DR: Read it though.

So now here I am... I ended up trading my stash back to my dealer so now all I have left is a little bit of monkey water. Knowing that I dont have anything to fall back on is frightening. I feel more and more nervous as I imagine the very real and now unavoidable moment that approaches. The moment when I squeeze the monkey water bottle and nothing comes out. What happens then?

I think I have a very emotionally vivid reaction to sticking a needle in a vein, and I'm trying to figure out why.  

As near as I can tell, I think it's the associations.  Our society avenges acts of violence by strapping the perpetrator down, sticking a needle in their vein and pumping in chemicals to smother the electrical activities of life out of them, a pharmaceutical pillow over the face of a hardened criminal who really deserves it.  

We could use more violence, like a beheading or a shooting, but of course, we do things the civilized way.  We're not animals after all.

And speaking of, we also do the same thing to our pets ""out of love"", right?  It's got to be for their own good, just like taking away their reproductive abilities in their earlier years.  Or a terminally ill person to ""end their suffering""?  We couldn't possibly relieve their end-of-life pain in any other way. 

'Cause if it looks like a medical procedure, with a guy in scrubs involved, we must be helping them, right?  Because doctors have never been known to act unethically.  After all, they give you shots and you've known that shots are good for you, ever since you were a baby.  They hurt, but that's how you know they're good for you.

And that must be why I can't stop shooting this orange crap into my veins.  The initial pain is almost an essential part of the experience.  Subconsciously, on a visceral level, it feels so therapeutic!  Yet I can't help but think about these other things also.

Need advice.,"Title is self explainatory. I have the OK to move to maryland and continue my drug court over there and i just have to come back once a month for court and do my status hearings. I am going to a nice recovery house in maryland because really having a plan to go to a recovery house is the only reason im still at my parents. 

So, I plan on going to see the doc at the clinic next thursday and starting detox the following monday. I will be going from 75 to 0 in 15 days, so 5mgs a day. I have been on MAT since july 31st of this year, i have also been narcanned while on 60 and it hurt like a mother fucker so i have a small preview of the pain i guess.

The things i have in my arsenal for me are, (unfortunately no weed cuz of drug court) 36 mgs of etizolam and im sure my mom will be nice enough to order more if im in enough pain, #51 600mg gabapentin pills, plus ibuprofen and all that OTC bullshit. I got some immodium sitting here and can grab another bottle if needed. 

I got plenty of time to kill to cuz im unemployed. The only thing that sucks is i still gotta go to a group once a week, individual once a week, and meetings 5 times a week for drug court, and i gotta go to the clinic and piss once a week all while drawing and watching everyone else dose still. ugh. But i got netflix, HBO go, reddit, and music.

Ill be honest with you guys, im definetly relying alot on etizolam to help me with this. Hope it works. So i plan on doing the 2 week taper to 0, then 2 weeks of hell at my parents house, and then to get into this recovery house i have to do 21-28 days in a inpatient place so after the initial 2 week taper, 2 weeks at the house drawing, ill have another month till i have to go to this house and start looking for a job and going to meetings everyday and all that shit so at least i got 2 months till i really have to be a part of the real world. 

TLDR; So, I plan on going to see the doc at the clinic next thursday and starting detox the following monday. I will be going from 75 to 0 in 15 days, so 5mgs a day. I have been on MAT since july 31st of this year

So after almost 2 years of binging H (iv) and every opiate I could put my hands on, I got clean. I am on naltrexone oral tablets (50mg) daily for about 3 months now. I refused the vivitrol shot so I have to deal with crushed pills that I must drink in a solution every morning. 
Beeing a good junkhead, after 1 month being clean I started preparing to get high one more time. So I waited. After 2 months I managed to avoid the naltrexone for two days (actually 60h) and went for it. And NOTHING. Maybe a slight buzz from the H but zero euphoria. I know the risks and I don't want to do abnormal amounts to get through the nalt, because the chances of getting it right are almost nonexistent. The next morning (~72h+) I wanted to try again. Just as I was leaving to get the dope, I got surprised and had to drink the solution earlier. Got really pissed. In the desperate attempt not to throw away the pervious 2 days, I runned in the toilet and threw up till I saw blood an felt there is nothing more left. It took me about 5 minutes after drinking the solution. So, because I really want to feel the warmth, I figured if anything was left from the pill it would take maybe 20 minutes till the naltrexone kicks in. Random bs. Maybe it would've been better to wait if the dose left was tiny. Fuck it.. Got in the car and took the dope. Took me 15 min. And...NOTHING. And those were some fat bags. 
Now, I heard bupe (subutex) has a higher affinity to bind then the naltrexone. Took 2 mg of bupe sublingualy at first. Nothing. The next day I took 8mg and felt a calming effect and uplift in mood. Next day took 8 mg again subli. Felt some warmth and relaxation finally (not like the one you get from H but...). It's ok at best if you compare it with the real shit but hey at least something works against this fucking blocker. I don't want to go 16mg at once. And I don't iv subs and bupe. I am sure you can OD even on bupe so be careful.
And the big question for you guys: Today I run across some fentanyl patches 25mcg/hr. I wonder if they can do a better job then the bupe? Anyone has some experience please share. I will probably get them and try but would hope for some input before I do. 

FOR ALL THE SHITHEADS OUT THERE, BE CAREFUL, ESPECIALLY WITH FENTANYL. DON'T JUST READ THE TITLE AND GO OH I CAN DO IT, BECAUSE YOU CAN END UP DEAD.",1516850776.0

But anyway fast forward to tonight and I go pick up from my dboy, guess what the stamps were.... Bingo, illuminati! So on my way home from picking up I pull over at the pride gas station near my house to pick up some Airheads Xtremes, and there's this guy in there who I sort of knew and acquainted with over the years and I shit you not he starts talking about the pope and the illuminati and the flat Earth and EVERYTHING like he didn't even miss a beat. It's almost like the illuminati is following me now, especially now that I made a Reddit post about it. If I randomly disappear forever let it be known that I got snatched up by rich people and used as a human sacrifice (okay I wouldn't be that mad honestly please sacrifice my body illuminati you have my permission).

And I seem to mistake reddit for my diary bc I'm pathetically alone with this shit, which I apologize sincerely for. 



As indicated, I used to do escort to support my habit. Now I only meet with two guys from that time whom I learned to like a lot. Just had a date with one of them and he's just he sweetest. He likes feet, he likes to cuddle, he okay with only handjobs, eats pussy like he has one himself and is a wonderful, insightful and intelligent person to talk to. I can't believe I'm getting paid to spend time with him. Granted, he's old and no Adonis, but that's why he's buying my time.

He doesn't know I use, but I think he might have seen my fresh track marks and I think he didn't really buy the 'I fell and cut my arm on a nail' story (it looks like a huge cut from some distance since I've been sticking the needle in hundreds of times along the vein). But he didn't say anything. And he said he can't wait to see me again. But I got major weird vibes I can't really put my finger on. Like, he didn't look at me when my arm was in the picture. 

Anyways, seeing him today was really a relief. Just having someone give me attention felt so fucking good. Tho it makes the pathetic emptiness of my private life really stand out. I finally ran out of coke and dope without buying new shit and intend to stay on my maintenance from now on. Been maxing out my credit card anyways with the last re up of my stash. 

Yesterday I had an important oral exam in uni. Didn't sleep the night before and was so speedballed out of my mind that I not only was shaking like a leaf in the wind, I made the most stupid mistake of mentioning stuff I couldn't elaborate on. It's still a good grade and won't affect my final grade negatively but I was so pissed off with myself that it really was the wake up call I needed. Hope it sticks. Today I overslept until 11am since I speedballed the last night away. luckily I actually do have migraine, so I could send a quick email without anyone getting suspicious at work.

I pushed the limit really hard, but with the money from tonight I can pay my tuition fee in time and since I'm exhausted from the coke hangover I'll be able to sleep tight and be at work in time tomorrow. I'm so relieved I didn't oversleep the exam or ruined my life by other means through this binge. Had the realization that I don't want to die anymore so there's no reason to wreck my life. Wanted to share this moment with you since there's no one else to share it with. And because I've been crying on this sub about how I can't stop binging on speedballs. 


Hope you're all safe, well and in control of things. <3",1516828795.0

- one guy seemed legit and was all for meeting me and selling me some dope... but he thought I meant weed and disappeared shortly after telling me he doesn’t believe in heroin. (It exists whether you believe in it or not)

- one guy told me he could get me some fire dope but I’d have to go to one of two strip clubs to get it. 

- about 3 guys asked if I just needed to earn some money for my habit. 

- a 43 year old man told me I’d have to earn dope from him and asked if I wanted to “party and get freaky naughty”

- a 27 year old legitimately asked “a/s/l?” Followed by “I’m really just looking for a fwb right now.”

- started talking to someone in recovery who sounds cool but for obvious reasons can’t help me out. 

And honorable mention (I’ll use that term lightly here) goes to the fact that I found out one of my old school friends is in whisper posting vaguely covered selfies of herself talking about how she’s trying to break up her ex boyfriend and his current girlfriend because she wants him back and how she’s already completed step one of her plan: alienating him from his friends.

What I have learned in the last six months is that it absolutely is lonely and dark to have lost her, wrong and sickening and sad. But life is not lonely and dark- life is just life, and I can seek light if I choose.

I choose to seek light in the arms of my dear friend Faith, long estranged but brought back to me in the wake of our all encompassing tragedy. I choose to seek light in loose change showing up in places that it should not, because though I have no explanation I know that it is her.

I choose to seek light in trying to help others from ever seeing the kind of darkness that I have (the kind of darkness that Stella saw)

I got a while back about a g of crack for free from my man and I just smoked the crack immediatly but after I smoked everything I stood the cravings to get more. It was a fantastic euphoria. And now I decided that I will get about 1-3 g of crack a month and smoke it and then its ok for me. I also want to try meth too. And I want to speedball too. So I drifted away with my thoughts my question was do you think its possible that I just shoot once a while and on the other days I will just snort my dope and be happy.

Firstly hopefully the location is stickied soon by mods to get the warning out. This is probably the first time I've been able to say me and my buddy were lucky to NOT get good money doing our ""games"" to get dope $. Our area a bundle is 13 stamps. We have about the same tolerance, and he often does all 13 in one shot if we made ok cash that day. Luckily, today again, we didn't so he only did 6 and luckily, I was there. 

He shot up in the car and after about 10 seconds I'm driving us out of the neighborhood and ask him if I'm taking him to his moms or uncles. No answer. I figured he just got tired of me asking. I have a brain injury and often repeat myself. I finally look over and see him all but drooling. Hat fell off, eyes closed, not sure if hes breathing but doesn't look like it, and his hand is on his neck almost like he went to check his pulse before going out.

I thought he was fucking with me. This stamps been around a while and this guy is not new to us and the quality is always good but never, like NEVER changes. (Someone obviously fucked up today). It's been so consistent we've been dumb and haven't even been smart and doing test shots. Luckily he only did 6 stamps instead of the whole 13 like he commonly does or I have no doubt he'd be dead atm.

I punched him in the leg HARD like enough to bruise each punch 4-5 times...nothing. Finally I pinched him hard enough to break skin and he woke up with no idea what happened and was angry I pinched him. This process happened another 4 or so times within 1-2 minutes before he finally came out of it. He remembers nothing besides getting pinched.

I was so afraid my friend was going to die right in front of me. Luckily he's good enough to load and shoot and register while im driving him. If he was home alone I don't know if he'd have woken up. Also, if he hadn't done the shot, I would have gone home and probably done 6 to save the other half until morning. Basically, we'd both probably be dead right now if he hadn't done that shot in the car.

I've lost many friends to ODs but never had something that close happen while I was there. He's on the sub but wanted to not be mentioned(username, first name, whatever) but John Doe, glad you made it and probably saved my life in the process too.

Please be safe everyone and don't be like us idiots where we went ""eh who needs a test shot? this shit never changes"". It only takes one fucked heavy fent batch.

If you see the sticky and live in our area, try to avoid it. You know how small our stamps are, .1 test shot of this could kill you. A single bag even with a high tolerance and you'd know because you'd swear you just did 8.

Dope in northern DE, Edgewood/New Castle area. Please read if you're a local.","This is a personal first hand experience so no BS. DE doesn't get mentioned a whole lot but if you're a local and read the title I'm guessing you know exactly probably to the or even the neighborhood I mean.

I've never posted one of these so I hope I'm following the rules but I want people to be safe so hopefully I can be specific as possible without breaking any rules.

Typical blue bags and it is stamped in black ""Ice Cream"". It's pretty commonly known in the area almost never changes so I'm afraid people will skip test shots and OD. Anyone not on reddit...well I wouldn't be surprised if there's a death already. Hopefully some fellow Delawarians read this and help get the word out on the street because it's pretty urgent as yesterday this same stamp was normal. Someone seriously fucked up this batch and my friend almost died over it.

Luckily my friend is ok. He has a high tolerance and if has the money will do a full bundle(13 bags here) shot and is perfectly fine. I'm similar but don't have the money to burn but I even will do 7/8 commonly without a test shot. JJ was with us and luckily he only did 6. I did not notice until I wasn't getting any answers on where I was dropping him. He was slack jaw wide open, eyes shut, hat fallen off, the works. I thought he was playing with me until I punched him about 7 times on the leg hard enough to bruise and it took an extremely hard(enough to break skin) on his face to wake him. This process repeated 4-5 times over 2 minutes and he remembers nothing.

Please be careful. This stuff is probably 10 times more potent than normal and I know these people make several stamps in that area so don't even do a .1 test shot, DE bags are small, so seriously a test of 1 stamp or .03 roughly is smart and try if at all possible not to use alone.

I feel quite ashamed because I took an opiate, but I think this will actually help bring me down a bit, it's A LOT better than hitting up the dboy for a couple wraps right ? 

I'm kinda ashamed of myself, but day 3 is usually the worst IME so if I use a once off codeine dose (extremely weak for me) to help get another day free from horse it is actually a good thing right ? 

I feel guilty Reddit, but also much much better.

... Some ketamine (pink rig) and a filter shot (blue rig). I'm not a huge fan of iv ketamine, but snorted doesn't do it for me and I really need to fall asleep asap and relax (it's 3am where I'm at).  




My mind is racing with cravings and I have almost convinced myself to go and buy some coke and dope after work, before having another date. I mean, the date money has to pay my rent, tuition and insurance. Of course, I'll scrape by if I spend a 50 on some dope tomorrow. But today was just day one after the binge. What tells me that it'll be only once tomorrow. 




Fuck, fuck, fucking fuck... I hate that I need to argue with myself and that it always comes to admitting that my brain is hijacked, but that I don't care bc I want or *need* to get high. Yeah, okay, I used to be very acutely suicidal, but I can use this only so long as an excuse for needing drugs to function. Because I am *not* functional on Cocaine! There is no valid reason to continue using speedballs. I'm forgetting little things, like, which compartment to put in the laundry detergent or noticing that I have already took out the toast whilst trying to get the toaster to release it... I took it out like half a minute before. I don't want to dissolve my brain. It's the only thing giving me a chance on a semblance of a normal life despite all the trauma and fuck ups. 




But when I go and get dope, I won't be able to orgasm and that's shitty. Coke let's me do that at least. And if I wait until after the date my dboys business hours will be over. It's just a cluster fuck. There is so much else I should be thinking of and attending to right now.

My questions are, how much potency have they lost, if any, being stored in a pill bottle in a cool dry medicine cabinet?

Also, how many do you guys think it would take and how often to alliviate withdrawal symptoms from a .3-.4g/day (when we can afford to get high) bth habit? Would tapering with Hydrocodone benefit us in that we would then be withdrawing from solely the hydro and no longer be affected by the horrendous H withdrawals?

this past Friday, i ran out of my gabapentins about 2 weeks early. i had ran out before, but don't remember having trouble sleeping. i also had 86% indica oil, but that's another story. so i guess i was well equipped, unlike this time. I didn't feel anything until sunday night into Monday, when i could NOT sleep. then came the anxiety and racing thoughts, then the restlessness, then the stomach pain, oh god the pain. worse than opiate withdrawal imo. i think maybe because gaba is absorbed in the gut? that's my take, but i also have a bad stomach.  but anyway, as time went on, it seemed to be getting worse. it got to the point that i was hitting myself in the head to try to sleep, so after 2 sleepless nights, i gave in and drove to the VA emergency and told them i ran out of gaba and cant sleep, within 2 hours of getting there i had my week early refill and my dosage upped.

Then a few months later after a forced apology for calling her a drug addict, I let my guard down in August and she gobbled up all my Flexeril.

3 weeks ago she asked for a muscle relaxer and I gave it to her, she immediately drank 6 beers and continued all night.

And like any good addict, I substituted one addiction for another in order to kick.

So I’m really struggling with my eating disorder now, bingeing and starving. 

I’m seeing my doc tomorrow and thinking about asking him for a Narcan Rx to help me stop bingeing.

Does anyone have experience with a patch? It’s supposed to be more effective than the spray because your med level is constant.

I’ve seen a lot of ads for combination bupe/narcan patches, guess I’m not even sure if there’s a Naloxone-only patch on the market yet.

I am a long time lurker and opiate head - 23 years since my first time H dragged me in.

I want to share a harm reduction hint for snorters, mainly Hydromorph Contin or Palladon as it's called in many European countries. The same obviously applies to any other fine powder but I found it especially important with Hydromorph since those beads - when properly crushed with a mortar - really turn into such a fine powder like flour, which makes it especially bad on the lungs. 
As hopefully most of you know, insufflating fine powders can lead to silicosis (dust lung) and is really dangerous. This can happen when the powder you are snorting ends up partially in your lungs instead of the nose which is obviously more likely with fine powders.
Silicosis is not something that happens overnight but rather overtime which makes it even more dangerous.
Street drugs like Heroin, Speed or Cocaine are often (or in case of good C always) not enough powderous to pose big of a risk, but obviously depending on quality and cutting agents used can also pose a problem.

We came up with this when snorting Hydromorph since as stated above, ground Hydromorph Contin/Palladon beads ideally yields a VERY fine powder which is virtually impossible to not end up partially in your respiratory tract.
We first tried to ""close"" the route to our lungs by trying to exhale or have your mouth full of water when snorting but neither really lead to satisfying results.

We then figured that we need to get the powder less ""flourish"" by moistening and drying it - while at the same time still grinding the beads all the way fine - since only that will lead to maximal effect and bioavailability.
So we would mix a few ml water (or even better saline solution which we make ourselves by mixing few grains of salt with distilled water)  with the powder - just enough to yield a paste which dries quicker. Results were good but it took a while to dry (30-60 mins. depending on amount of water etc), and interestingly enough the powder never turns back to as fine a powder as before moistening it, even when completely dry.

We then improved it by using much less water, it suffices when you lay out the powder flat on a clean surface and spray it slightly with some water/saline solution.
After spraying we mix the powder pile with a card to make sure all of the powder is equally moist - this approach will yield a snortable powder immediately (i.e. no need to wait for drying).

Since we discovered this we enjoy our snorted Hydromorph much more since we don't have to worry about silicosis anymore - before without moistening you could feel how every line would dust up your lungs which takes away the fun of it...

Try it - you'll be surprised how easy it is and your health will thank you in the long run.

So being the good little junk box I am I hit the streets, off on another cold copping adventure.  
It didn't take me too long to find 2 guys (we'll call them L and D) standing around, looking like they hadn't washed in a week or 2 - perfect. This was far from my first time doing this, so after a quick chat and the promise of a bag they jumped in my car and directed me to the spot. We get there and they ask for my money, I laugh and tell them no. I was only spending £20 so we eventually decide that one of them would stay in the car and the other would leave his phone with me while he went and waited for the runner. I was still wary but figured eh, worst comes to worst I could probably get close to £20 for the phone anyway. Thankfully it didn't come to that, a few minutes later L jumped back in the car, drugs in hand. We swapped numbers, I dropped them back into town and went on my merry way.  
Over the next 8 months I'd see L and D almost every day, so I'd like to think we got to know each other pretty well. There were a few times I was short and they'd cover it for me, and a few times I helped them out too - all was well in my little bubble of opiates.  
Last night I went to pick them up like normal, but L wasn't there. No problem, me and D headed to the spot by ourselves (something that had never happened before). I didn't think twice giving him my money, it's the same routine I'd done with L for months. He hopped out the car... and that was the last I saw of him.  
30 minutes later I get out and go looking for him... vanished. I check the other spot they sometimes wait at, not there either. 8 months of helping each other out, spending at least an hour a day chatting, all gone for £25. What really pisses me off is if he'd just asked I'd have happily broke him off something, but instead he had to be a greedy prick and take it all for himself.

Don’t start IV’ing. It is overall the most dangerous ROA, and don’t take that as a challenge. It requires being skilled at all aspects of vein care and venipuncture, as well as sterile technique to reduce the likelihood of health problems, and even in the best of circumstances things can and DO GO WRONG, even in a hospital. So imagine what you are likely to pull off in non-sterile environment without formal training from a tech.
Mods: if this isn’t appropriate to post, please delete. I am doing this with the intention of harm reduction using information gathered from online research and my own personal experience.

Okay, that introduction was long for a reason: I needed to included all that info and to maybe weed out anyone not patient enough to read it to get to the IV’ing part. If you’re anything like I was when I first started, you’ll sacrifice your arms (and brain) in the name of getting high (science).

Syringe choice: BD (Beckton Dickson) syringes are known in the IV community for being the smoothest plunge and having the slickest needle. You should always *always* use a new pin/rig/syringe, but if you’ve ever found yourself with only a used one of your own, bleach it and use BD brand always because they’re also known for maintaining a smoother entry on second use (Not that you should, it ruins your veins and raises the likelihood of infection and vein issues). 

If you buy an all-in-one (AIO) syringe with a non-removable needle, do your veins a favor and don’t get insulin syringes. Thanks to u/GeneralCha0s for educating me on this. Why? Because insulin syringe needles are designed to dive through layers of subcutaneous tissue (Not veins)and they leave a hole, rather than a slice in the vein, which takes longer to heal and contributes to fucked up veins faster than using a hypo needle which is *designed to pierce veins*.
Yes, it will take you longer and may initially be more difficult to hit with a different rig, but in the long run, it is worth it IMO.

BARREL SIZE: If you are going to the lengths that I did (in the name of science) to find the perfect rig, I suggest detachable needles. If your hit is over 45-50 units, get a 3ml syringe barrel. The bigger your hits get, the harder it is to keep your hand steadily in one place on the syringe. (You’ll need to be careful to go slower pushing your dope in to not blow a vein, since 1/4 inch plunge on a 1cc has less force than a 1/4 inch plunge on a 3cc—I did the research on PSI’s in syringes. It’s a fact).

Anyways, in a 1cc with a giant hit, your thumb just isn’t long enough and you’ll end up creeping along the syringe like I did, missing the vein or slipping out and wasting your dope and hurting yourself in the process.

If you have long fingers or a ring on the end of the plunger, different story. Carry on. Smaller than 50 units can stick with a 1cc/ml.
Also, make sure on any rig, to prime the barrel. This is a medical thing that means taking the plunger and pushing it in and out to make the plunge smoother before you draw up.

NEEDLES: think of this as being like the fork you eat with (yes, please eat). You wouldn’t eat a bowl of cereal with a fork if you had a spoon. Don’t use insulin syringes or needles for veins. They’re not meant for veins. You’ll spill your cereal/milk trying to hobgobble the shit in your mouth (vein).

BD needles are the best, hands down. Some ppl prefer Terumo if you’re not in the States, which is good also, but I already mentioned why I like BD’s. 

LENGTH: If you have fresh veins that are relatively shallow, go for 1/2” to 5/8” needles. You’re less likely to puncture through the back wall of the vein (I hear stories a lot of people swearing they’re in the vein because it registers, but feeling burning). This is why. Puncturing all the way through a vein, registering while pulling out, and putting the dope in will make it look like you’re there when you’re Not. The result is a fucked up vein that may not heal and a pocket of dope that may  abscess.

For scarred or deep veins, go for a longer needle (not my thing, maybe someone can chime in on the length & gauge).

GAUGE: in general, the smaller the needle, the better. Less damage overall if you’re shooting clear or H but if you’ve got a thick shot, a slightly bigger gauge will work a bit better. Most can fit just fine through 30g.

They do make needles that are 27g with a wide bore (just means the hole is bigger for the dope to get through without putting a bigger hole in your vein). Check it out.

Once I started using the right equipment, I had much better highs, less, wasted dope and no misses. A miracle for this dope fiend. I do have a lot of info on aftercare, but I’ve made this post long enough.

TL;DR, use the device that gets you there with the least damage so you can keep getting high without moving to your neck, groin or other dangerous sites. Bonus: when you quit, your veins are likely to heal much more quickly.

Edit: FWIW I used to be a phlebotomist.

Edit 2: I used insulin syringes for years but couldn’t make them work for me the past year. This is why I went Bill Nye the Science Guy all up in this bitch.",1517061744.0

Basically he has been clean from opiates for 3 months after a pretty much straight year of using. He decided to use tonight and was super high and feeling great for a few hours then he started throwing up violently and has a migraine like headache. Its been going on the last four or five hours. He cant keeo anything down and is just moaning in agony.
This has happened to me as well after picking up black tar heroin after being sober off opiates for some time. 
Is this common?? Seems to only be with tar though. It happened to me in LA multiple times over a two year span and now its happening to my buddy in Portland so i think it must have something to do with tar in general  

If this has happened to you, whats best to help? Im usually sick for an entire day after and then feel perfectly fine. Im hoping he is not sick that long, however. Using more does not seem to help so i havent let him use since his initial dose which wasnt even much.

I plan on going to buy some weed in the am because thats the only thing i can think of that wont do more harm than good. I have a lot of gatorade but he cant keep it down and dehydration just makes the symptoms way worse.

I saw Cliff's sister walking her dog so I gave her money for six subs at standard face value. Then later on, an hour later she called me to verify the order and then called again thirty minutes later to tell me she got it. Wow, that was quick.


Cliff owed me so he gave me some of his script. This time the roxy 15s were not green but white. Never saw white oval shaped roxies before. They still work the same though form what I can tell. Maybe I should try that new loop straw that someone psted the other day. Never had trouble with my lungs before from snorting and I'm hoping to stop soon but never hurts to reduce harm in them mean time I suppose.

&nbsp;

So anyway, before work today I visit Cliff's to get the pills he owes me and to check on his sister to see if she was home to give me my subs.

Her friend, Danika was there just coming in with the dog. She mentioned to me that she just picked up 90 subs form her doctor and that she's trying to sell. When she realized her friend Cliff's sister got me subs from someone else she was upset because ""she knew I (Danika) needed the money.""

Danka then sprang into talking mad shit. ""I paid $300 to fix up the walls in that room then she let DJ move in for $125 per week."" You see, a couple of months ago she was in that room with some big African American dude (Danika's a white chick with thinning hair) and she gave me $10 that she knew I could spend on something I could find a connect. The $10 was given to me so that I'd fix a ripped power cord. So I rigged it and earned those ten bux.

In between getting tools from other rooms for the job, the door kept getting locked and I ahd to wait outside the door. She was either blowing this guy, or doing coke, H, PCP, or something else. Like I said, despite those delays I was successful.

A day later she was kicked out for prostituting herself in Cliff's house which Cliff's sister didn't appreciate. 

&nbsp;

Back to today she's in the house and Danika is saying ""Cliff's sister was jealous of me because I had an older man hanging around taking care of me... she texted and said I was mad ugly..."" 

She then went on to mention the time (the one time out of eight) where Cliff's sister had $60 of mine for subs that got stolen because the sub connect ran with the money and didnt' come back the following day because of ""snow"". Danika speculated that maybe it was true but felt more strongly about the possibility that money was owed to that connect and this was how the connect got it back from her.

&nbsp;

Well anyway, despite me being re-stocked in fresh subs, Danika insisted on giving me a free sub. ""Do you want a pill or a strip?"" She woudln't take no for an answer so I took the strip.

She then said that if I ever needed any I can get a credit up to three days in advanced and that she'd sell me 15 of them at a good discount. Furthermore I wouldn't have to pre-pay her for them so transactions would happen in real time.

Danika further speculated that Cliff's sis was making money by getting me my subs. I don't know if that's true unless the sub connect was charging her less than normal street price which I'm fine with as long as the profit motivates her to get the subs quickly and without fail.

&nbsp;


Not sure why Danika insisted on giving me a free sub.

&nbsp;

Later on while I was away, Danika got into a fight with some guy outside. Was making mad noise. Cliff said he stayed inside and wouldn't get involved. Then Danika came knocking on his door and was like bugging and black and blue. Complained that nobody would come out and help... She was also asking for me but who knows why. Tech help?

&nbsp;

Hours later Danika had pain in her stomach and an ambulance came to pick her up. Cliff's sister needed to use my phone when I came up stairs to check who got in the ambulance and to make sure it wasn't Cliff's sister. So after making some phone calls and trying to get some update info on the situation she asked to borrow my bicycle. My $700+ bike. She wanted to go somewhere two miles away to knock on Danika's man's door to do something or get some update.. IDK. 

I said I needed to check something, reminded her that she cold contact my phone if she needed me and got the fuck out. 

The idea of loaning my bike out is a risk I'd prefer to avoid taking. If that shit disappeared she wouldn't be able to replace it and I'd have a terrible day, week, month....... It was once speculated that I'd kill myself if that happened. Probably not, but I'd feel awfully shitty. 

Hope Danika feels better, and glad I got what I paid for today since it is a critical part of my plan. To have more than enough subs to get me to my next pay cycle. By which point I will either have insurance and a photo ID or a photo ID and money from my next pay check to see a sub doc. Then I can be sub human :p",1517049261.0

I have no idea where else to go for advice. I'm just trying to not be in pain and also not come across as drug seeking. For years this has just been a joke in my family about how pain killers do not work on me, but now that I'm getting older - and the pain is becoming much more common - I just need some advice.

I need to know how to explain to doctors that I'm in pain, I'm not drug seeking, and the normal first-line level of opiate-based pain management is flat out useless on me.

I have never used any opiate for fun. I'm certainly not one to look down on anyone for chosing to do so. Just saying I don't have that opiate use as a background to explain the tolerance. 

---

Even after having my wisdom teeth removed, and the oral surgeon had to keep increasing my dosage to the point he was afraid I'd have respiratory problems, my surgeon was utterly stunned that I wasn't outright anesthetized much less able to feel pain. I'm not even remotely sure how to address this. The surgeon asked me to come in and chat, asked if I'd taken the medication - and upon saying yes - was just stunned.

That was my only time ever being anesthetized and I'd managed to count back from 100 down to 80 before the anesthesiologist said ""well I guess he was right,"" adjusted some things, and I was out when I got to 65.

I'm seriously not even trying to get high or to even feel good. I'm just trying to be able to go to work without having screaming pain. But since apparently this is rare, and of course the ""opioid epidemic"" makes doctors wary to prescribe.

I have a history of all kinds of painful infections (all non-drug related) that required pain management just to get through my day. I used to be able to just call my primary care doctor, even after hours, and explain what's going on - and they'd call in a script for the standard antibiotic we needed to manage the infection plus 10mg hydrocodone w/o APAP because for me that's basically like taking acetaminophen. Of course that's not doable ever since hydrocodone was made schedule 2, but frankly hydrocodone doesn't even seem to do much of anything to me anymore.

That's not hyperbole, either. 10mg of hydrocodone for me seems to be the same kind of analgesia an average person gets from 500mg of acetaminophen.

A doctor telling me to take an NSAID or acetaminophen to help pain is pointless for me unless there's swelling the NSAID will actually deal with, and in those cases the NSAID's effect is paltry compared to an actual steroid. E.g. if I twist my ankle and it swells up I need a steroid shot, not oral steroids, to bring that swelling down. Dropping my pants and getting a huge steroid shot in my butt is something I've literally asked for more than once because I know it's the only thing that will work to bring my sprained joint back to normal.

Which gets to the crux of my problem.

The last time I saw my doctor for managing this chronic condition they'd perform a small amount of surgery on my skin and even with 4+ vials (I am not exaggerating) of lidocaine it would be all I could do to bare it. I'd grit my teeth and try my damnedest to deal with it - I honestly through about asking for a bite guard because my teeth were hurting from biting so hard - and trying to hold back from crying. For days afterward any wrong move would leave me yelping in pain and crying. My wife would come back, let me lean on her, and give me time to get my breath back because the pain was so sharp I couldn't even breathe. This usually lasts 3-4 days after the procedure.

And if you're wondering - yes the procedure is necessary. I've been dealing with this for almost a year now and I'm just so goddamned tired of being in pain and crying from it.

Maybe I'm a wuss, but holy fuck I have no idea how to handle this.

Because everything I've read, everything I'm told, is that basically the pain shouldn't be this bad. The doctor isn't doing anything wrong - I've researched the hell out of the treatments and watched the doctor perform it: everything the doctor & nurses do is 100% textbook. I've even consulted with other doctors about the proper treatment protocol to make sure everything is being done correctly.

My current doctor has written me a script for tramadol, I've taken a large amount (200mg), and had zero effect on me. I can only assume I lack the liver enzyme that turns tramadol into desmetramadol. Since tramadol has effectively no affinity for opioid receptors tramadol does nothing to help pain for me.

I have another treatment coming up in a couple weeks and I'm completely afraid of it because I can't deal with it again. I'm completely terrified and want to cancel the appointment, but for my own well being that's not an option. Last time I was in there for the procedure I broke an arm rest on the side of the exam table from gripping and pulling on it so hard trying my best to not move - I literally sheared a piece of steel in half from gripping and pulling on it so hard - and I assure you I'm no body builder.

----

**How do I convince my doctor that my pain is sincere, that the normal treatments aren't working, and do all of this without coming across as drug-seeking?**

I am utterly 100% terrified of a doctor writing ""drug seeking"" on my medical record.

My life was the way it always was as a junkie.  You know what I'm talking about.  I walked like 10 miles a day minimum, because this place had no public transit, not even a taxi cab service.  A lot of hippies lived there so thumbing a ride wasn't out of the question, but I was a junkie, so I walked everywhere.  And everywhere was way, way, way spread out, like super far away from everything else.  It was a desert town so there was no shortage of space when they planned housing.  
Anyway, at this same time, I was known at one of the local coffee shops as a junkie by the hippies who frequented it and owned it.  They didn't necessarily hate me for being a junkie per se but they did hate me for this one time they caught me stealing an organic fruit rollup and shooting up in their bathroom.  The owner literally used to chase me to the bathroom and bang on the door screaming that, ""IT BETTER SMELL LIKE SH*T WHEN I GET IN THERE!!!!!""  
I still hung out in their courtyard anyway and one night, after a day of walking and walking and walking and getting a few good shots of black out of it, I was starving and dying for a warm place to sleep.  These hippies who had known me somewhat before I relapsed and definitely knew me now took me home.  It was a woman's house.  She was fat but very pretty and probably 27 or so with 4 kids.  She made money as a seamstress or whatever she did and wore cockroach killer cowboy boots and a straw cowboy hat.  At her house, which was the way things were for most hippied out single mothers in the town, there lived four or five other grown men and women full time.  Outside of that there was an influx of anywhere between 10 and 2 people.  This night I can't remember how many there were, maybe 12 of us besides her and her kids, but I had never been there before.  I only knew like one guy's name and another girls name, but there I was all nodded out and hungry and getting stared at hard between these hippies all beating on their drums and passing joints, which I sucked down every chance I got.  They would laugh at me for taking such big hits like, ""This dude is definitely a mooch.  He's just trying to smoke the whole joint every time he gets a hit.""  They were right.  I was selfish.
So anyway, the single mother in her cowboy boots and cowboy hat has baked like two whole oven racks of chicken breast.  It's beautiful, golden brown, salted and greasy.  
I'm not sure exactly what they were waiting for.  They didn't say grace.  They weren't Christians.  Maybe they were waiting for the rest of it to be done, like some other part of the dinner, baked potatoes I don't know, but they were all just waiting politely to start eating the chicken.  
Well I wake up out of this hard nod and walk right over to the pans with all this chicken waiting to be feasted on and I grab some a breast with my bare hand and start mowing down right there.  Grease was running down my chin.  I'm sure I was making a ton of noise.  I ate several more pieces before anyone else even stood up to get one.  They were all looking at me like, ""What the F, dude?  Who are you and why did you eat our chicken like that you selfish piece of crap?""  
I'm hungry is what I would have said. Or maybe I'm the perpetually nodding chicken man?  I do'n tknow what I would have said, but I just walked to the back and found a mattress and crashed out until the morning.  When I woke up I walked back to town with one of the only two people I knew there, my pregnant friend Wendy.     ",1517036842.0

For 2 years i’ve been using a product that is kowingly an unknown Fent analogue suspected to be **Furayl-Fentanyl** mixed with heroin.

When i began i would get dope sick 10 hours after being dry.  Intense symptoms.

I then introduced **subutex** to my life *pretending* to get clean but really would just use it as a safety net.
I would run out of gear and dose 2mg for the 4 day waiting for fix. 

**Then something happened...**

I stopped subutex without any problems first of all... when subutex was out of my system and life, i continue using the heroin product...

 **Now, and since then,  i’ve been using and running out continually without any sign of withdrawals.. **zero. 
NONE!**

When i finish my bag, i can go 4 days in complete health, health like someone not on drugs, full sleep, energy, no symptoms, until i score again.

Does anyone know what this is? Could it be an unknown fent analogue that somehow ligers in the body so long that it prevents sickness?

**Ive never gone longer than 5 days without, that would be the challenge and experiment, but those 5 days i am in zero discomfort as opposed to High temp, RLS and vomit 10 hours after occuring at first usage — as mentioned above**

I’m trying to figure out what exactly happened so if anyone can conclude something from this, that would be awesome.

Well if you go check my post from yesterday you can see that I was having trouble finding rigs, but needless to say, I was able to purchase some this morning.

Okay so I’ve been using once a week usually, maybe once every two weeks(just wanted to give an idea of where my tolerance is), and I snorted like a point last night. I must say, before ever doing the dope, I was feeling a bit off...maybe just a little cold or something. And I wasn’t able to fall asleep. 

Fast forward to this morning and I get my rigs. I IVd maybe 40mg, which is a normal amount that I’m used to. Also I hadn’t eaten this morning (maybe that’s important to the story). It’s starting to kick in and about and I notice  feeling weird psychologically. Like something just didn’t feel quite right, and I think I was kinda scared so I remember just trying to walk around to stay moving. 

All I remember from there is waking up on the floor next to my bed with a bloody gash next to my eye. I must’ve fell down and hit my head on the bed frame. I kinda felt slow, like just stupider lol.

There’s so many factors to this that I’m having trouble figuring out whether I ODd or just passed out from lack of sleep. Either way, I got a gash next to my eye and knot on the back of my head.

Pretty scared to think the possibility of an OD, never had that happen before. I’m kinda shook up from this

Edit: So conclusion is it was an OD. And I have thought many many times what it would be like to OD and it was not like it at all. I expected an overdose to make you feel really heavy and weighed down as if gravity were twice as much. I can’t really describe it to a T, but it was more like a weird type of anxiety followed by blacking out.

Edit 2: thank you all so much for the advice and experience. Now I realize just how serious this was and I could have very easily died today. This will be a good motivator to give up opiates.",1516988733.0

I am not referring to ULDN (which never worked for me at any suggested level), but doses high enough to potentially produce low-grade precipitated withdrawals. 

After scouring the internet, it appears that people who take doses of 1 - 4.5mg WHILE dependent notice a tolerance decrease the following morning. Some report it even eliminates the growth of tolerance, the payback being a ""minor withdrawal"" for an hour each evening after the naltrexone is dosed.

I am currently 8 months into a daily Kratom habit - generally three 5-6g doses a day. I have skipped a few single days and did not notice any serious withdrawals, but never more than 40 hours. 

Yesterday, 18 hours after my last kratom dose the previous evening, I decided to try out LDN. I had etizolam and gabapentin incase things got too rough.  

11:30am: 1.5mg NTX

T+45min: I began to notice aches and pains I hadn't noticed the prior six months. My stomach also felt knotted for a few moments, but that went away. My eyes and nose began to run a bit, but nothing too bad. My mood was still basically fine. 

1pm: 2mg NTX

I took 2mg of etizolam at this point in case the restlessness got too much. I felt a minor increase in withdrawal symptoms by 2pm, but I can't say it was worse than coming off a minor habit. I felt some restlessness, a bit of anxiety, but it was very manageable.

I awoke at 6am today and took a 4g dose of kratom. The effects feel a little stronger than a 6g dose - nothing clearly beyond placebo at this point - but this was a haphazard first attempt. I want to continue playing around more to find the right time-frame and dose. 

I believe small daily doses of NTX are (or ""may be"") much more beneficial than ULDN, which I have not heard any real-life positive experiences about beyond ""I think it's working."" I think some actual, noticeable antagonism has a greater effect on discouraging opiate down-regulation. ",1517158737.0

He's been lying to us and being sketchy as hell, and we just can't have him staying here. I feel terrible and cry when I think about making him leave, but he won't admit he's shooting dope (even after finding a hypo cap and filters) and won't let us help him clean up, and I can't have that kind of shit in my house.

Anyway.

After a series of lies, he admitted his limp was not a previous break, but a venous ulcer on his leg ""that's been there for years."" 

So, I'd like to ask: 

Does a venous ulcer heal once you stop using the area to inject, or does that shit just stay festering? 

What kind of medications or ointments or wrappings would best treat it? 

I've got some Amoxicillin I bought off of Amazon - would that help it heal at all?

This is my first post so if I break the rules or something please let me know, it wasn't my intention.

First of all, I need help. I need to know whether if I can use an excuse that would be valid in order to get my ass safe instead of getting it fucked...

So today I shot up a few lines of heroin, after being clean months and months I relapsed again. The thing is: my parents are aware of my addiction, so they are making me random drug tests over the time so I can't know exactly which day I will be tested for, so I need help.

Its obviously that if they test me right now I'd be screwed, this is why I'm actually thinking about what can I say in order to, if they catch me, at least have something else to say rather than admitting I indeed did heroín, which would make me have to go to rehab...and that cant happen since I'm going to university. 

So... If my information is correct, these drug lab tests don't actually look for the heroin itself, but its metabolites (6-am), that they are on the body for at least 24 hours until they turn into morphine, right? This is the same process that goes for codeine when you take it, it turns into morphine as well. So if I tell them that I did codeine but not heroin, would the lab still be able to test my pee to know that the metabolites in there are from heroin consumption? 

I mean, do the laboratory drug test can check whether if I consumed heroín or a different opiod? I know this can happen if the test is done within the first 24hours after consumption, but what about after that? Is it possible to know?

Tell him I’m trying to get some work done at home tomorrow and he gives me the go ahead to work from home (LOL) Friday. Great. Bang the 3rd dilly when I get home and take another 0.25. Fly through the night clean the house, have some opiate sex that can’t be beat (no cum of course but hey c’est la vie.) 

Friday- 2 am
Dilly connect calls saying he’s gotta leave town for 24-48 hours and offering to front us the 10 dillies we usually get on Fridays when the check hits right then and there. Don’t gotta ask me twice haha. Head down to him. Throws me 12. Sell 3 to my neighbor (I don’t tax him he’s my friend) and we stay up all night chillin smoking blunts and listening to music. It was great. Pass out at 6:30. Work” is at 9.

Friday- 9 am
Holy shit I feel like crap. Open the laptop, pay the rent, the bills and answer some emails. Smoking a fat joint of course. Finish the “work” around 11. Sleep til 3. 

Friday- 3pm. It’s time. Start banging the dillies like they’re going out of style. We’re safe, use clean rigs, 3 auto injectors on hand just in case, plus we are each other’s “Narcan butlers” if she takes a shot I don’t for a minute and vice verse. Neighbor comes over. Smokes some weed with us and we chill and get takeout and drink some beer. 

Friday- 8pm. Our weed/coke man calls up and offers to throw us some Bars (gg imprint 2mg) and weed for free since we made him dinner the other night. Weed was fire, bars were as always great to potentiate  and chill. Got an 8 ball too and just spent the night railing that shit plus doing modified speedballs (no dope obvs). Snuck myself a 20 rock too because crack is bae. Pass out at 8am. 

Saturday -6 pm. Wake up feeling how you expect to feel. Check the mail walk the dog, smoke a blunt, and who’s driving through but the ice man. I hate ice for the most part but if I have Xans, I can get rid of the shit aspect of it. Cop some ice, smoke it up, bang a dilly and take a bar. Now fucking rocked, smiling, laying with my love and my other love my dog. Life is good man. When this lifestyle works it works. But tomorrow I’ll be back in my suit, heading to work. Not gonna touch shit for a minute obviously. Gotta at least pretend to be managing. 

Note: I did this shit constantly for a decade spend it in and out of jail and rehabs. I do this a couple of time a years to keep my sanity. But don’t do this every weekend. Just wanted to let y’all know its been a good day. ",1517110825.0

I know that type 4 diacetylmorphine is a salt and technically water soluble, but when it is in the water before heating it seems to sit at the bottom whilst the water stays clear, not dissolving, while as soon as I add heat it dissolves and turns the water a honey color. The normal amount of water that I use is 80ml, and after heating and filtering I get about 72-75ml back. I don't like to use any more than that because I like to leave a small space at the top of the syringe so that I have some room to pull back and check that I'm in a vein without popping out the plunger, I actually prefer to use less water so that it's more concentrated, but I worry that a smaller amount of water won't be able to absorb all of the product.


I've now read that it's totally useless to heat the solution beforehand, that all it does is dissolve insoluable additives while evaporating some of the product. However, much of the internet seems to be giving me conflicted information. I use .5 most of the time that I use, which is mostly every weekend.

Ive tried dressing up and dressing down. Ive even resorted to just walking up to strangers that fit the stereotype. 

In regards to the homeless, i either get the person who doesn't know, or the ones who supposedly know, but i have to front them the momey to go and get it. As with always should be the case, i never let money walk, but ive even done that on small amounts. (On a side note, when dealing with the homeless i always offer to either buy them some, or throw them a $20 for the help).

Nothing has ever worked and its getting very frustrating. I don't look like the typical addict because im still a little overweight and i dont shoot, so no track marks. But, i also don't in the least bit resemble a cop. So, i understand why someone wouldn't just walk up to me, but theres no reason if i walked up to someone that there ever be a doubt that im a cop either.

I live in a city thats one of the 35 largest in the US, so its not like im in the middle of a corn field.

Also, ive went to the local needle exchange, but its also the city clinic. So, you habe everyone going there from kids to elderly. So, its not as simple as i had hoped.

Does anyone know of something that i hadn't thought of? I don't want to go to any of the local NA type places. I already have enough bad karma going against me.

I am afraid of just suffocating to death in my sleep. 

Right now it's nearly 5am and I'm drinking coffee to stay awake until I feel like I can sleep safer. Maybe I will exercise. I am not sure coffee is the way to go either because I feel like that increases the lack of lung function.

This is the biggest problem with this stuff for me. It can be such a soothing experience and such a good painkiller for my migraines but goddamn a guy's gotta breathe ya dig.

Now Ive seen and read a little about this coca cola thing where you put the pill in coca cola and let is sit for like 24 hours and it blows up in size. Im curious what exactly is the point of that? Does it make it so you actually feel 40mg or 80mg when you take it orally cuz i know compared to swallowing an old OC 80 the OP 80s feel more like 40mg. So im just wondering if putting them in coca cola for 24 hours is to make it feel like the actual mg it is? If so is that the best way to swallow them or would it be better to cut them up into pieces with fingernail clippers and then let them soak in coca cola? Im just trying to find the best way to take these and get the best results.
                  Ive been on methadone maintenance for over 3 years now and after 6 months of it it stopped helping my back pain. So for the last 2 and a half years ive been stock piling opiates to take when i get off the methadone or maybe down to 10mg.(currently im on 52 but about to go down to 50mg tomorrow) In the last 2 1/2 years ive bought 1 gram of U-47700, 1 gram of furanyfentanyl, 3 25mcg fentanyl patches with the gel, 3 opana 40mg ER made by global pharma so their crushable to snort and shoot or so ive been told, 200 percocet 5s(I do the Cold water extraction well used to), and 4 OP oxy 40s. Before I got on methadone AKA Satan's drug I was prescribed 30mg roxicodone every 6 hours and those 2 years were the best of my life! Had a full time job, a car, money but now i literally spend every day every hour lying in a bed. Thats my life now. Its to the point where im avoiding taking showers cuz i cant stand up long enough. I used to shower every day but now I get a shower once every 3,4, or 5 days and im FUCKING 25 YEARS OLD!!! I think about suicide all the time but i believe in god so if i kill myself i will go to hell. So i decided to get a hold of a gun, call the police and tell them some bullshit story that i just killed my parents and when they all show up with their guns aimed at me raise my gun so they will shoot me probably 20 times and kill me. Thats the kind of shit I think about. I suppose you have nothing but time to think when you live your ENTIRE LIFE in a bed. Sorry for the long dramatic post. I went way off topic, so someone please explain whats the deal with putting OP oxys in coca cola and someone please tell me the best way to take them orally to get the best results.",1517246915.0

A card of some sort is the best option for me as it fits in my wallet, is inconspicuous, and easy to use. 

I normally use players cards from casinos, hotel room keys, gift cards, anything like that. They don't have any raised numbers/letters on them and work great...until they break. No idea how long one card lasts on average for maybe a couple to few months? Just broke another one and it's getting annoying. I would really love to find a card to use that would last me much longer. They end up splitting down the middle to the point where they break in half and are unusable. 

Any recommendations?  If anyone could point me in the right direction I'd really appreciate it. Not interested in a bullet or snuff kit or anything like that, really just want an extremely sturdy card, or if there's nothing like that just somewhere I can buy super cheap cards. I'd just buy some gift cards, but minimum is $25 on most and don't want to spend $25 on a card I won't really use the money on, and the card won't last super long. If I could buy a gift card with no $ on it for a buck or something I would happily buy a bunch. Huge bonus if I can buy it off Amazon :)

My questions are these: has anyone ever used a drink, like QCarbo, and actually read the instructions and stayed clean for 48+ hours before pissing? What happened?

The other question is about waterloading. I am coming from a place here not of daily use...I only used twice (about .2, then waited two days, then maybe another .2, probably less), but I figure there is really no point in pissing within 48 hours of using, even if I drank all of Lake Michigan? Am I wrong here? 

After the 48 hour mark, at least with just using once or twice, i figure waterloading may be able to save you. 

Anyone have any experience with this? Anyone pass sooner than, or at 48-72 hours by waterloading? I know nobody can tell me for sure whether or not I'll pass. My u/a's are monitored and I'm a female, so substitution is really risky and maybe not even possible...

I haven't told another living soul this and I never plan to but I have to tell someone. I even made a throwaway I'm so embarrassed/guilty. 

It was me who clogged the toilet at work. We have a small office so it's 1 toilet for the men and 1 for the women but somehow I was able to avoid getting singled out or even suspected. I clogged it so bad the plumber had to come in. Idk how much he charged but it wasn't fee.

Idk how I was able to ignore for so long but as soon as I sat down I knew that it was *about to go down* (or I wished it would go down). I even had dope in my system... Took a shot a few hours earlier, didn't matter the baby had dropped my water broke contractions were very close together this baby was ready to be born.

Once I sat down and realized this was happening I started doing the math in my head. To my horror i concluded that I hadn't had a bm in about  2 weeks (13 days to be exact). 

I've read stories on here that claim to have been longer even weeks longer in some cases and God bless you all because 13 days is a personal record I do not ever intend on matching or God forbid breaking.  

A 13 day old piece of shit was in me and was more than ready to leave me. I'll spare everyone the details but omg was it something I never want  to experience again for as long as I live. 

Before I do anything I get up and have to look at this thing I mean cmon. I wouldn't say I was proud but a small piece of me did want to take a picture( I didn't). I swear it was bigger than my roommates new puppy which is about 6 pounds. I can't even think of the adjectives I would use to describe this thing so I'll just say it was fucking huge. According to South Park 1 Katie couric is approx 2.5 pounds of shit (source: http://southpark.cc.com/clips/1cgdy1/crap-verification ) so I honestly felt like it was at least 3 Katie courics. I'm a big guy and I ate regularly for 13 days. 

So naturally any regular 1.8 liters per flush American standard toilet wouldn't have a chance and ours didn't. Of course that bathroom doesn't have a plunger (there is one in there now 😅😈) I was in there forever trying to get rid of this shit and finally got it to the point where the toilet looked fine but almost overflowed every time you flushed it.

A lot of people were out to lunch so I slipped out the back door. I went and did my daily lunch shot and everything seemed normal when I got back. It wasn't until a few hours later that someone mentioned the toilet was messed up. We couldn't even plunge this thing the plumber had to come and idk what he did but he was there all afternoon. 

There wasn't much of a hunt for who done it although everyone in my department was saying they knew it was this guy Z in my office. Don't really have anything else to say other than sorry.

I had to tell someone but all of my friends are normies and wouldn't really get it like you guys with the way dope makes you not shit. If you read the whole confession thank you for your time.

Why did you decide to try it? What happened that night, etc.etc. 

I remember my first time like it was yesterday. I remember the fear and excitement and honestly, everything about it. 

I was so scared to use. I thought I would drop dead the minute I inhaled it, lol. I had been mainly using morphine and dilaudid, sometimes percs. I banged once or twice, but mostly just sniffed it. I had been curious about dope, and had a close friend who had started using again. 

We went out to the beach with this girl who was using back page at the time. She would pretty much shove lines right under our noses all night. 
I did my first line and five minutes later, was raging. Every single thing was annoying and made me mad. So I did another line, and another. I was nodding out, talking to myself, not making sense. I remember we hopped out after driving her around to different guys to grab a drink. I couldn't even walk. They had to help me into the bar. Tried to drink something, but couldn't and honestly, didn't want to. Which was saying a lot because I was a pretty bad alcoholic. 

It ended with me basically crying for Wendys. Really wanted some of their baconator fries. 

I used for the best couple days as well and they all kinda blended together, but it was fun while it lasted. I miss both of those girls and that plug. Not sure if it was just my low tolerance or what, but we all swore that was the best dope we had ever tried. ",1517193135.0

Turns out 2 days after I got out I find out I’m in big trouble for some stupid shit I did before I went to rehab. So I get arrested for a felony theft charge, and pretty much lose my job that I have been at for 6+ years.

I was devastated but I stayed sober for just a little longer than 60 days and relapsed on 4 mg dilaudid. I had some money put back for emergencies that went fast without working. When the money ran out my dilaudid plug would give me fronts, it was cool no big deal. Pay him when I could. Well I started to rack up that tab. I would pay for them when I could but if I couldn’t come up with any money, he would just throw me a couple and all was good. 

Well lately trying to find a good job with a felony theft arrest has been proving a little hard. I haven’t been convicted yet. I hope my lawyer can get it dropped and expunged. First time being in trouble blah blah blah.

My plug, his wife passed away last month, the lady I would call momma and it was a sad deal. But he has continued to front me. I probably have a tab close to 800$ right now. I feel like shit for getting it up that high, but also very thankful that he continues to help me. I will get my taxes back within the next couple of weeks and I’m going to pay it all back and then some just to show I’m extremely grateful that he has helped me so much.

I love opiates. I also haven't touched them in a month or two. I don't even remember when the last time was.

This isn't some situation arising from a lack of availability, although I suppose it helps that my closest source is about 90 mins away in a sketchy part of illinois. I also use a range of chemicals but opiates, especially oxymorphone or heroin, are the center love of that enjoyment.

I also know what it's like to be a slave to this stuff. When I first picked up painkillers around 17, I knew this was what I would always love. I also ended up quitting right before I was desperate enough to start injecting since I knew that was gonna mean no way back for me. Did a bunch of lsd and cleaned myself up.

So maybe I'm just lucky? Some weird set of circumstances where I got hooked quick & psyched my way out of it means now chipping with arbitrary lines drawn in enough to keep things from being bad enough to make me say screw it and jump on the h train to oblivion? Or am I deluding myself (as I'm sure all the replies are gonna be cool, stop while you're ahead then).

But like, when I use and when I get to using regularly enough, it feels like I notice the diminishing marginal returns and can tell myself 'well, time to face the flu and anguish, wait a few months, and hop on that crazy ride again.'

Idk. ""I'm not special"" and ""I won't be able to do this forever"" are always in the back of my head but sometimes I wonder if that's what keeps me fine. When I'm off I really don't crave much at all. Just kinda think, ""oh opiates, right. Those are nice. I sure could go for some but eh...""

(I know, right? Total shocker. LOL.) My dope fiendedness (Yeah, that’s, FOR SURE, not a word. Ha ha ha.) is only rivaled by my dick piggery. (Man, the “words” I’m using today, I’ll tell ya what!)

Anyway, when this story took place, I was successfully just “chipping”. (As a matter of fact, I’m actually still just a “chipper” via some sort of fucking magical miracle. Ha ha.) Thus, I wasn’t even sick when I did this... I just absolutely refused to wait. AT ALL. 

SO, I didn’t have access to a vehicle when this all took place, thus I got an Uber to take me into the nearest city (which is approximately an hour away) and had him drop me off at spot set up by my d-boy. After some mild confusion (which actually had my dude laughing at me as opposed to being annoyed/pissy with me, which was nice) I met up with him, picked up my shit, and started back towards a spot where I could easily pick up another Uber to take me home. 

Unfortunately for me, there were ZERO businesses around with a public restroom. And if you think I was gonna wait until I took the hour ride back home to rip into a couple of those puppies then you’re fucking crazy, mate. LOL. So, as I’m tooling around these side streets and alleyways, my dumbass rolls a twenty up into a tooter, rips open 5 bags, dumps ‘em out onto my phone, and then quickly dips beside some rando’s garage and snorts those babies down... er... up. Whatever. 

Looking back on it, I’m pretty damn lucky nothing went wrong! There were people milling about all over the place, so it was quite the “bold” (fucking stupid) move on my behalf. 

Anyway, how about all of you lovely folk? What’s the most dipshit move you’ve made trying to fix up (or even just cop in general as I’m starting to have my doubts that very many people are as fucking moronic as I am.) while in public?

Also, did I mention that I tend to ramble like a son-of-a-bitch when I’m rocked? Yeah, I sincerely apologize for the horrendous length of this post. (Please don’t stop loving me due to it!! I don’t have any bropiates in my “real” life.) Anyway, that’s what I’ve got! How about ya’ll?

I know at my highschool I was paying 5 bucks for 40s, 5 bucks for 80s sometimes, and often getting free pills for little favors and fun.  In that environment, it did not take long to become quite addicted to oxycodone. It was months of use before my first taste of withdrawals, but when they did hit, damn.

      I remember being home alone, luckily, and just not able to be comfortable. Hot and colds. Fucking bone pain. Rage. Crazy RLS. Fiending.You know. After that experience, I tried to manage my sources a little more carefully and started my habit of immediately hitting up dude after school. Somehow, I managed to keep my scholarship, but to assure my receiving it I still had to go tutor second or third graders at the end of my day, sometimes sick as fuck...And those kids, man, they knew something was not right. It was beyond fucked.
   
      That's also about the time I started listening to my Dad's collection of John Prine and began to be haunted by the song ""Sam Stone"", and began to realize I was a junkie.
Fast forward a few months to graduation, I blew 2 80s right before and looked like a fucked up ghost, barely able to walk. The resulting photo of me receiving my diploma was, needless to say, horrific. 
  
     As you can imagine, it wasn't long before I began thinking about the needle. Promises of better highs and lower usage and all that. Thank God I was aware of the extreme danger I was playing with and after failing due to not tying off properly, said fuck that. A nicely deviated septum it would be. 

     Apparently observed by angels, I discovered a solid Methadone connect in yet another one of my young peers from school. Soon freed of my increasingly expensive oxy habit of 60-80 dollars a day, I actually starting doing much better. I was using my scholarship at least. 
   
     So I started on Methadone right before 2004. 2004 is also when my future wife and I began living together. Thank the makers she wasn't a junkie too.  By 2008, I knew I had to get off the shit, but I had no idea how.    By this time I didn't even know how many of what pills I was doing.  To get a handle on my situation, I started a Pill Journal, trying to document myself for myself.

     I did this with varying success for 3 years before I finally got to that famous place all good junkies eventually enter. I fully understood what being sick and tired of being sick and tired meant. 
     
     Finally, through a series of divinely fortunate events, I got an excellent opportunity to quit in March of 2011.  It started with a dinner with my then soon-to-be fiancee who I had somehow managed to hang onto. We're having drinks, waiting for our server, and next thing I know I'm nodded out, waking up to a super angry soon-to-be fiancee.  See, I'd gotten very good about not committing the sin of nodding, and had managed to stay on my girl's good side because of this. Now, I hadn't nodded in a public place in a good while, and doing so for the first time in a while was suddenly, extremely embarrassing.  Next day I went out to help my mom and consciously halved my dose so as to avoid ""The Conversation about Methadone"". Which of course we talked about. Leaving my mom's on my reduced dose, listening to some song about marriage, I realized if I was to get married, is have too get clean.

So I did. The next day, I hung out with my best friend, who didn't approve of my use at all. Again at half my usual dose, I realized I had been tapering for 2 days, so I might as well keep on it.     
     
    This was my chance to quit and I fully embraced it. I kept halfing my Done till I could take morphine. I halved the morphine till it was a few milligrams. I spent the next month feeling crazy, but I got better. On my brother in law's birthday in early April I took nothing, but was able to eat. A month later I felt like my head was screwing itself back on, and every day I got a little better.

     Now free from my demons for the first time in my adult life, I got to work. Asked my girls Dad for permission to marry his beautiful daughter. I bought a $5000 Tacori engagement ring. Bought a $9000 wedding package at a Couple's resort in Negril. Life was great. I was getting married to the love of my life and things were amazing.  

      This lasted almost 6 months.  AND THEN.....I got hurt. We were on a float trip. There was rope swing. Ok. I swung out of the tree like a dozen people before me, but landed on a jagged-ass rock, and gashed a hole in my leg. I  bleed for 5 hours. After 2 days it still hurt like hell, remarkably it wasn't broken though. I started to think opiates would help, and tracked down some morphine. 

To be continued, I'm  wishing I could fucking  sleep tonight but I'm gonna keep trying.",1517294809.0

Holy shit though. I can't believe I've made it this far. I didn't think I was going to be able to, forreal. I know that everyone around me didn't think I could do it either. 

I've never done 100% abstinence before. And it's crazy how it's getting easier every day as things even out.

I had completely accepted that I was a junkie no matter what and I was going to either die in an overdose or get killed  by a john or in some other fucked up situation. 

I never thought that I had a chance at a normal life. But now I'm starting to see that it is possible for me to stay clean. That maybe I won't die young. That there is hope. 

I'm not saying I'm going to be perfect or stay clean forever, but I'm going to for quite a while. I'm not going back anytime soon. 

There is hope guys. Seriously.

      I’ll make this as brief as possible, I am a black tar smoker and I was supposed to induce today but caved and ended up smoking the resin from my tooter around 12pm. I bought a half at 2:30 and used about half of it, then took about 5-6 hits around 6:30, and finally I used the rest of it around 9:15 (about 4 hits).
      So I’ve always waited 24 hours after my last use to induct sub but recently read that this isn’t necessary and you are good about 12 hours after. I was gonna try to be in that range tomorrow and I am wondering if I’ll be good especially because my last usage was a pretty small amount. 
      I’m not sure about this but I would imagine if your last usage is a smaller amount, then you can induce faster than you normally would AKA you don’t have to wait as long. What are your thoughts & experiences? I am hoping I will be good tomorrow after about 14 hours but of course I’m gonna see how I feel. Thanks!",1517291865.0

I was put on 16 mg of suboxone a day exactly two weeks ago, and having been down this road before I know I only need 8mg a day to feel normal. So this last Saturday the 27th, I once again fell to my vice and copped half a gram.  I hadnt taken my subs for about 30 hours so I definitely felt it, probably around 80% of its strength. 

Now prior to me getting on subs, the dope I was getting was definitely fent laced, I know this only because I would get sick a measly 5-7 hours after a shot, not because of its strength, it was pretty weak, like a 4 out of 10.  But the dope I got on Saturday was from an old connect that went dry months ago because he actually had a conscious and wouldnt sell any dope laced with fent.  He calls me (unaware of me being on subs) saying hes back with his original product which is about a 9 out of 10, easily the best Ive ever had, and I succumb.

Sorry for the long rant, heres my question.  I did the last of the dope yesterday morning around 10am, a tiny line and a cotton from the night before, just to get a little buzz, was FAR from what I could do. This was the same dope I was doing probalby 6 months ago, and would start to WD around the 16 hour mark. But its been about 29-30 hours since then, and I have zero withdrawal symptoms, not even sneezing-which was always first for me.  I desperately want to get back on my subs, but am terrified of precipitated WDs.  Is it safe for me to take a sub tonight? Every site on heroin WD says they kick in 8-24 hours after last shot.  Has anyone ever had similar experiences?

I started escorting when I was almost 18 to get away from my parents. They weren't abusive but I felt suffocated. They used their money as leverage and it made me feel like shit. I bounced around on the East Coast for a bit but after a serious depressive episode I moved back to the midwest to live with them. It was about 3 months after my 18th birthday when I moved back with them. I enjoyed the lack of responsibility, the lack of rent, bills, etc. Not having to escort to pay my bills was a big weight off my shoulder. It was during this time that I started injecting heroin. I also overdosed for the first time in my life. A few months later I moved out again but got an apartment just 10 miles from them. I burned through my cash fast and at this point I was sober and going to AA. Well of course I relapsed soon after I moved. I went to the psych ward and then got high for a while. I eventually joined an intensive outpatient program which helped a lot. About 5 months after I moved into this apartment I decided I had enough of this small, grey town and picked up my stuff and moved to the Southwest. I started attending community college which made my parents happy. In return they covered my living expenses. Of course here I relapsed. I started escorting again and using heroin but neither of the two stuck. I would have short binges of both activities but mainly focus on school. I began to become really unhappy. I hadn't made any friends that stuck around and spent most of my time holed up in my apartment. I was now 19. People at my school weren't too friendly. I would start doing heroin every few months for a few days. I would escort here and there to bring in extra cash. I made the decision to drop out of school about 6 months after I moved to the Southwest. I packed up my shitty 18 year old beater car and drove it all the way up the coast. I landed in a new city. No job or school lined up. Lots of cash in savings from escorting, no real relationship with my parents at this moment. I moved in with this random girl and to be honest I feel really lonely. My landlord just texted me and made it clear this apartment wasn't even a done deal so I have all my shit here and I might have to move out tomorrow. Nice. I would like a normal job but I have to pay for a surgery that I need. So I guess I'm just gonna be escorting to pay my bills and keep my savings up. I don't know. I'm stressed and lonely. I want to get high, but I want it to be different. I would always get high alone or with this one girl who was dumb as fuck back south. Either way wasn't very fun. I wish I could just meet some chill people and fuck around with them. I'm over it. I'll be 20 this summer.

Today, when we get to the street we're meeting the plug on, the middle says ""I told him you're from (very, very rich/ snobby suburb of our hometown that is already considered rich and snobby to begin with), that's why it took us so long to get here"" 

That's when it occurred to me that he had told his plug he'd be frequently bringing a ""rich white kid"" that he's middling for/ taking advantage of from the suburbs through, in hopes that the plug would throw him a bunch of free bags for the business. ( because he couldn't charge me more than it actually cost anymore, I told him the only way I'd start going through him again is if he only charges me what he's getting it for per bag, and I'd just throw him some bags for the help) 

This is extreme bullshit, because not only am I not from said rich/ snobby suburb, I am NOT rich or anything else fitting the stereotype of the residents of said suburb. I've posted screenshots of how this middle talks to me, demanding I get more money than I can as if I can pull money out my ass. 

He even has told me to steal money from my parents, and tried to get me to pawn my laptop or guitars on the empty promise that he'd pay me back come payday l. 

Anyway, he gets back to my truck and hands me the bundle that he copped for me, and then I look over and the plug is beckoning me over. So I walk over to his car, ignoring the middle asking me ""wtf I'm doing."" When I get to the window, his plug asks for my number so he can send me his info, then hands me a completely free bundle, despite being told that I'm some rich white kid. 

Of course, the whole ride back to his house, the middle is bitching at me, telling me it's not safe and that I need to keep going through him if I don't want to risk my life and all this stupid, racist shit. Bitch, I lived in the hood for 6-7 years when I lived off campus for school, including 2 separate trap houses. And that whole last year living up there, I was cold copping just about every day. Pretty sure I can handle myself.  

So I now have not one, but two of this middle who tried to violate my shit's main plugs. It was a good day, r/opiates. 

PS I'm sure some of you are going to tell me that this plug only wanted my number because he believed the middle about me being a rich white kid from a really expensive suburb. When he texted me his info so I'd have it, I made it abundantly clear that my financial status and location were greatly exaggerated. He said doesn't care, as long as I'm regularly copping off him.

Right now I'm weak. Depressed. Broke. Alone in a foreign country. He saw that. Has been watching me preying like a lion. Then tried to strike. Acted like he was trying to be nice. 
 
I thought he just wanted to be a good friend. I only hung out with him for a total of 8 hours. Initially talked to him because he knows dealers and I'm tryna get rid of some subs. Said he could help. Obviously did not have sex with him not that it matters. Only thing he bought me was a pack of cigs but at the end of the 8 hours he acted like I was indebted to him. 

Now he's blowing up my shit ringing my apartment building door ringer thing and he told me ""u have a problem and you don't know it"" I've ignored him since. He also told me he's watching me on the camera. 

Thank god i talked to a good friend after hanging out with the creep. The friend advised (thank you I'll always be grateful for you, you know who you are)  me to stay away and knocked some sense into me because I always assume people have good intentions and if dope isn't involved I'm the one that gets manipulated. 

MY WOMEN AND SISTERS BE FUCKING CAREFUL. ITS NOT A SAFE WORLD FOR US. IM IN THE ""first world"" there are predators EVERYWHERE. 

Also don't get the wrong idea I'd die before prostituting myself. It'll never happened has never happened. He really would have had to abduct me. But imagine if it was a girl that was slightly more desperate. What a piece of shit. 

What kills me the most is all his friends saw what was happening knew he was trying to meet and groom a new girl into the life and no one said a thing. How could people just let this shit happen. 

I've been worried he'll break into my apartment do something as a warning like kill my cats. Abduct me. Dude it's half paranoia half fears based on fact and logic. I can't go to the cops I'd also die before being a snitch. 

I told my dealer about this he told me he'll have people on my street look out for me. I can't sleep at night. I'm sorry this isn't opiate related. But I had to share. This is turning out to be a rough year. Im a fucking dumbass. 

I have to be strong. Sigh. Also I gotta move out of the hood. 

If anyone has some advise on what to do if he gets more aggressive if ignoring doesn't work please let me know. Thanks. ",1517268648.0

7twjop,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7twjop/methadone_is_very_very_kickable/,12,https://redd.it/7twjop,beekeepersmyth,"Methadone is very, very kickable.","This is a post for people who are wanting to kick hardcore opiates. My advice can extend only as far as my own experience as I'm not a medical professional, so understand that this (and most of the information you read on the internet) is just my own experience.

I was on methadone 80mg/24hrs and I was so sensitive to withdrawal that I'd rock up to the clinic every day with my eyes watering, yawning, with a runny nose and aching everywhere all over my body. I didn't handle any physical or psychological discomfort well at all, which helped lead me toward opiate addiction. Prior to methadone I started with uncontrolled low-dose pharmaceuticals like Neurofen Plus that helped me control symptoms of depression. Of course, barely any time passed before it was Panadine Forte and doctor shopping. After a while, I was ingesting so much ibuprofen and paracetamol that my liver and kidneys started showing the early symptoms of disease.

So, heroin was a logical choice...you know...to 'be healthy'. Haha...I still laugh at that justification, I actually can remember saying it to my dealer who died in a public toilet later that month. There's just enough truth in that particular justification for it to work...so it's kind of genius. I can still hear my internal thoughts about it from back then and I seriously can't help but chuckle. 

'Well mate, congratulations, you've stopped putting that sh*t ibuprofen and paracetamol in your body, it's just pure opiates now which are practically HEALTHY!'

Nek minnit...

Full blow heroin addiction for two years that destroyed my life completely. Sure, the first few months were great. You've heard it a million times, so I won't repeat it too much but EVERYBODY thinks they can have a handle on it. They don't. I'm yet to meet a single person who can control hardcore opiate usage. But the demise of my life is a whole other story, and is none of your concern. You're thinking about kicking so, here's the kicker:

I then tried to rebuild my life (and finances) by going on the methadone program and moving in with my Mum at age 30. I started psyching myself up for rehab as I didn't like how unmotivated and isolated I felt. I wanted to get clean and have a better life for myself. So, the month before rehab, I started using on top of the methadone. Fentanyl patches and snorting china white. I overdosed twice that month and nearly died.

Anyway, when I was in rehab I was going to gradually reduce my dependence and jump off around 5mg. I went in on 80mg and over a week got down to 70mg. Now...this is just me, but I was wondering why I was prolonging the inevitable. One morning, the nurse gave me 7mg instead of 70mg. The doctor had filled my order wrong and it was taking a long time to get her on the line. Something about the chaos of the doctor being unreachable and the nurse refusing to administer my normal taper combined to make me realize that the only solution I had was to take responsibility myself. The thing that made me laugh is that the 75mg dose of the previous day was clearly visible.

I walked out the door a week into the program with only a small reduction to show for it. But here it is...I just stopped taking everything. Completely cold turkey. Here's what I was ingesting daily when leaving rehab.

75mg methadone
150mg sertraline/zoloft
150mg lamotragine
40mg diazepam
20mg tamazepam

I was a cloud of meds, high and unclear.

I would only put food and water in my body from that point on because I was so utterly over the chaos and drama the drugs were causing me. I'd tried to kick before, but this was different. I was taking back control through responsibility. Having said that I felt awful for a month and not quite right for another three after that.

The point is this though...when you're ready to take responsibility, you can kick anything.

I'm not kidding when I say this, but my life turned around so quickly. I got a job I love that pays well, I'm going to the gym regularly, I have an amazing girlfriend who is not only a babe, but a great human and I live in a clean, nice house that I love coming home to. I've been both fortunate and brave. I endured the suffering I had to go through and came to see suffering as something I needed to take on my own shoulders and not shirk or outsource to others.

In short, I'm a man with meaning in my life that isn't overcome with resentfulness or loneliness.

I'm happy to answer any questions, but just know that if you want to take responsibility for yourself and take the burden of living on your own shoulders - it's not only possible to redirect your life to something beneficial for yourself and those around you - it's essential.

This is a pretty specific post, but I'm hoping that someone here can help.

I take kratom regularly. I've stopped for my trip. The withdrawals are much worse than I anticipated, much more like normal opiates than I imagined. I'm looking for some way to get myself through this. Not looking to get high, just to not withdraw during this trip. It was a last minute trip, and a ""surprise"", so I didn't get to plan it as well as I had wanted.

I know that kratom is banned in Ireland, and I believe the UK. So that leaves me with two options: lope and codeine. 

Is codeine still OTC in Ireland? Anyone have information about that? 

The problem with lope (which I'm taking currently) is that it sounds like you can't bring much into the country. I bought two of those 200 count bottles, which helps a bit through the withdrawals, but it's not perfect. I take about 20 a day currently. As I said, the withdrawals are bad. But with Ireland, the max you can buy is 20 ct at a time, which would be a huge expense. And you can't bring in bigger bottles than that, according to a lot of forum posts of people in the same situation.

So I could buy it there as the worst case scenario, but I'd really rather not. It would be ridiculously expensive. I don't have much money at all (the trip was completely paid for, never left the country)

So I'm hoping that maybe codeine is still an option there. Not sure how it works OTC, or however it is. 

Any advice from anyone? Thank you for taking the time to read. It's an oddly specific post.",1517264696.0

Feeling really bummed out today...

I have a friend, I'll call her Jane, who I have known for 20 years. Her and I are both heroin addicts, but we don't use together. We have our own separate lives, but we talk just about everyday and we help each other out when we're in need. 

Lately, I've been in need a lot. I don't have a car, my job has drastically cut my hours to 1 or 2 days a week (currently looking for a better job) and my husband has recently had major back surgery so he can't work rn. The one good thing we have going is that in less than 2 weeks we will be receiving a large settlement from the insurance company. 

So, for the past 2 months or so, Jane has really helped me out, above and beyond. When I've been in wds she's given me 30 Gabapentin, 2 suboxone, a bunch of muscle relaxers, and some seroquel tabs to help get me through the days when I can't get any opiates. She has even brought them over to my house for me and given me a couple packs of cigarettes. 

When I have the money, she has picked up my dope for me (when she was picking up for herself anyway) and brought it to me when dboy couldn't come out to me, and she has picked me up to take me to see him with her. 

She really has been a damn lifesaver and I planned on making everything up to her when I get the settlement money. Also, she has offered all this to me, I never had to even ask. 

So yesterday, I had some money and dboy was going to come to me. In the morning, Jane texted me and said that she was going to see him anyway and would come pick up my money and go see him for the both of us. I told her that he was coming out to see me and she said it would be faster if she just went to see him so I didn't have to wait until he could come out here and that she didn't mind at all and was happy to do it. She was picking up her other friend (well call Kelly) anyway and they were going to see him. 

So I said ok, thank you, etc. They come and get my money and I threw her $20 for gas/whatever. I was getting 6 bags (his bags are .7 each) they were gone a little longer than usual but finally came back about 2 hours later, dropped it off and that was that. 

Well, 4 of my bags were short. They were only.5 instead of .7
I asked dboy if they were short for some reason and he said no, they were all .7

They pinched .8 from me. Fucking .8!! I always offer Jane some for going through the trouble, she always declines. Yesterday was no different. 

So I confronted her and of course she blamed Kelly. My husband is pissed. They stole from us when we hardly have a penny to our name, and we gave her $20 AND we offered to give her some H.

I'm conflicted because yes, she stole from us, but she has been so good to us the past 2 months that I'm not sure if I'm even allowed to be mad. I'm actually really hurt by this but I don't know how to handle it.

Anyway, my husband wants to cut ties and definitely not do anything for her when we get the settlement. I'm not sure what to do.

Any advice?

tl:dr  Good friend pinched a lot of my bag, I owe her a lot for all she's done for me over the past 2 months. Do I forgive this, or am I right to be angry?


Edited to add:  I have done my fair share for her over the years. I've given her a place to live and fed her for almost a year without asking anything in return. ",1517253145.0

Long time lurker.

I am currently in a sub program but not always doing what I should be doing. Currently getting prescribed 6mg, but usually take 2mg when getting sick. Other times I am just using, but he does not UA me as much as I should (Knock on wood).

In addition, I get clonidine, 0.1 mg, prescribed to take two a day, but only given 28 pill. Therefore he is not the most intelligent person because this does not last me even close to a month.

I take the clonidine to help with anxiety as well as sleep. I was wondering what are your thoughts of me suggesting benzo or trazodone for sleep. I usually take the 0.2mg (2) clonidine at night to help with sleep but it has not been working as well lately. My question is should I ask him to prescribe me those pills or no. 

In addition to these two medication, he also gives me Lithium and Wellbutrin both of which I do not take but he thinks I do. 

P.S. First time poster (hope I am not breaking rules, and hope to get clean soon but too dang hard!

EDIT: Thanks to all that replied, I figured I couldn't Benzos but I wasn't sure if anyone had any similar situations to this. Plus, he did offer addy for when I am off the suboxone as I am still in grad school",1517252174.0

But I've never found drugs (except for an MDMA capsule once at a rave like 5 years ago and a bag of coke at that same rave which sucked because I didn't do coke). Anyways, yesterday I'm driving home from work and as I'm exiting onto a ramp to the interstate I see a Michael Kors bag on the shoulder of the road. I immediately pulled over and walk the 20 feet back to get it, and then after hopping back in my car and starting to drive again, about 30 feet down I see two prescription bottles so I pull back over and grab them. Now this was super sketchy in terms of safety because it wasn't even a full shoulder as I was still on the ramp going from one Interstate to the next. But back to the important part, one prescription bottle was gabapentin and it still had the sticker on it with all the patient information, the other bottle didn't have a tag and after Googling that pill imprint I was pleasantly surprised to learn I just found 32 morphine sulfate 30mg!!!! I was able to return the Gabapentin to the owner, who was extremely grateful as she had nerve damage from a botched wrist surgery earlier this year, and unfortunately there was enough information from the stuff left in the Michael Kors bag that I will be returning that to its owner this evening. I was honestly hoping the bag would be empty so I could sell it but it had the contact information in a notebook right inside and I have lost my wallet and had it returned far too many times not to pay back that Karma. But the morphine came at the perfect time as I am both trying to cut down/ quit h right now and due to bills I spent my last $20 on some H that lasted me Monday and tuesday, so I was going to have to go to work today in withdrawals. Instead I have a nice little buzz going and I can start tapering tomorrow. 

Also apparently the reason of the bag was on the side of the road is there was a spree of smash-and-grab car robberies the other night and I'm guessing that's where the thiefs started throwing stuff out of their car that they didn't want. But they were some damn shitty thieves considering they threw out a perfect condition Michael Kors bag and a bottle of morphine.

Edit: just copying a comment I made before I get asked/told something related to this multiple time.  **There were multiple people's stuff stolen, and the 30's had no information on them and she never asked about them. If she would have said anything about missing morphine, or the bottle had identifiable info on it, I would have handed them right over.**

But seems like lots of good people, useful info, and entertaining stories to say the least. 

Anyway, to the post. So long story short, I’m a pretty small guy (currently around 5’4 130lbs +/-) I got pretty serious into lifting in high school and through the first year or so of college (until the real addiction started taking hold). In that time I never got very big because I still lacked proper nutrition, etc. but I was very fit and lean. 

Currently, I haven’t been to the gym (or done any real physical activity, except for at work) in at least 8 months, and my diet pretty much consists of heroin, cigarettes, Red Bull, milkshakes, and pretty much anything sweet or terrible for you lol. 

But I feel like I look great! I’m obviously not as toned as I was when I was going to the gym 5 times a week, but I’m still around the same weight, and thin but not “skinny. ” I honestly feel like I look better than I would if I wasn’t using, or going to the gym. 
Not to mention, I seem to have gotten many more compliments on my looks/eyes while high, but that might be a coincidence. 

So what are you guys’ thoughts?

Btw I didn’t really mean for this post to be this long, I finally just got my fix after being sick for the last 3 days on top of recovering from a car wreck 3 days ago, so I’m giddy lol. Also, nice to finally “officially” be a part of the community!

They also sold fent as dope to an old acquaintance of S's who ODd from it and fucking died. She shouldn't have let her money walk but we are all fed up with this horrible excuse for a person and so she told me she is going to try and trick them into doing dope cut with a ground up sub pill (maybe more like sub cut with dope, not sure what her plan is exactly). My question is will this even send them into precipitated WD? If one shoots dope and sub at the same time is it a similar effect to taking subs after doing dope? Has anyone ever experienced this, either purposely or accidently or done to you without your knowledge?  


Seems like involuntary precipitated withdrawal is essentially torture, but doesn't leave any (physical) marks and is likely not life threatening. This got me thinking, is there any evidence that governments or other malicious organizations have used this as an actual torture method? Switching between the calm and peace of opiates to the pure hell that is precipitated withdrawal... I can't imagine anything that would be worse especially if it was dragged out over days, weeks, months... Goddamn it's fucked up what people do to people. At the same time, I can't really feel bad if this guy ends up in precipitated withdrawal for an afternoon, would be peanuts compared to what he's done. 


To be clear, it's not me who is planning on doing this, but I am curious about if it will be effective. So, share your experiences with me please my friends.

I certainly haven't heard this one yet, but hopefully it's not your first time and can offer some clarity.  I've been on Subs for 8 years now and something odd has happened over the last 12 months that has me freaking out.

The first seven years (or so) I was stable at about 1.2-1.0mg/day without issue.  Suddenly a year ago I started having terrible stomach problems which I can only think was digestive paralysis which caused really bad acid reflux, very poor appetite, etc.  Around that time, I dropped my dose a bit to see if it would help and it did.  Reflux subsided and digestion improved.  However, I ended up right back at the same spot again just a couple weeks later with same 'ol ""taking too much"" symptoms:  not digesting, constipation, sinus congestion, joints not cracking, back pain, low libido, minor headache, too tired, etc.  So I had to lower dose again to steady myself.  This has gone on for 54 charted weeks where I recorded my daily doses and I'm surprised to see that I dropped over 50% from about 6.5mg/week to now less than 3.0/week.  That's right, I'm doing about .5mg per day now in an effort to keep up with what my body is doing, and now I'm at the point that I have trouble getting to sleep, not feeling like I'm taking enough to get through the day, etc.  Each time I've dropped I've had some w/d but lately it's way less intense.  I used to get RLS like crazy but now it's more of just trouble sleeping.  Last week, I lost some hearing in one ear because of how congested I am.  Usually I can drop my dose either for a short while or permanently and the snotfest starts and all sinuses drain.  Didn't happen this time...it's like the w/d aren't even going to start.  

I must be nuts, but are these lower doses that much more powerful?  Or is my brain shutting down not-in-use receptors now?  More importantly, what the hell is my body doing?  Why this forced taper?  It's like I'm fine for 2 weeks after a small drop, and suddenly I'm still on too much.  Could really use some feedback for cause.  The only other thing I take is vitamins and antacid.

I feel like at this point I'm going to have to either stay at a steady dose as long as I can and see if my body re-adjusts (and hope my hearing comes back/sinuses drain/can defecate, etc.), or just try skipping an entire day or two and see if that kickstarts minor w/d because it feels like I wouldn't even get it anymore.   

Anyone out there ever had their tolerance drop automatically like this?  How do I get it back up? ",1517377697.0

He was different from others and he got pain killing plus an energy boost from morphine/h. But that only lasted two weeks.
Any apparent boost in energy the substance was able to provide was only present for two weeks maximum. Then the permanent sleep would start to take hold. 
So although he got energy upon second try, two weeks into the addiction, he was effectively almost permanently asleep. It took him years to learn this only because of how hard the stuff was to get where he was located. 
 He also told me that refined opiates were only mans way to take far too much of a plant that is dangerous enough in its natural form. 
He also told me that bone density loss and hypogonadism are not worth the temporary relief or apparent benefits of even raw opium. Or any of its derivatives.
He was lucky enough to find subutex in a time capsule and tapered off using that once his injuries (the original reason for his use of opioids) healed.

In the play, a character is addicted to painkillers, and I want to make sure I'm portraying her accurately.  I am NOT looking to vilify the person with this addiction; I am looking to, as always, be honest.  Whenever a character's experience is outside my own (as this is), I want to try to get as much input as possible from people who have the first person perspective that I lack.  So, after checking with the moderators, I wanted to ask you all this question, and you can either post your response publicly or PM me, if you like: How do you perceive the world when you are high on painkillers/opioids?  What changes?  Is the way others perceive you similar or different to the way you are perceiving yourself (and how)?

I get that some people feel that way- The National Center of Addiction and Substance Abuse defines addiction as:
“Addiction is a complex disease of the brain and body that involves compulsive use of one or more substances despite serious health and social consequences. Addiction disrupts regions of the brain that are responsible for reward, motivation, learning, judgment and memory. It damages various body systems as well as families, relationships, schools, workplaces and neighborhoods.”
https://www.centeronaddiction.org/what-addiction/addiction-disease
People argued that the addict chooses to try the drug and therefore is responsible for their reckless behavior/they are not victims of an addiction. What about people who get hooked from a doctors prescription-it can be as innocent as a small script after wisdom teeth removal to trigger an addiction. 
So I know how I feel- I have had my own struggles with addiction & watch the show Intervention (I know a watching a show doesn’t make me an expert—- also I have another post about the show Intervention and their work in the Heroin Triangle) and strongly do feel it’s a compulsive disease that needs treatment or over time it can lead to death or other dangerous health issues. I get that to some maybe even most that perhaps comparing addiction to say a child who has cancer who has “no choice” is absurd. However what the definition above is saying is that the addict has no choice either bc their brain chemistry changes. 

So in your opinion, why or why not, is addiction a disease? ",1517340409.0

The FDA is asking manufacturers of loperamide, which is available OTC and by prescription, to change the way they label and package loperamide to ""stem abuse and misuse that leaves us deeply concerned,"" FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, MD, said in a statement.
In 2016, the FDA warned about life-threatening cardiac events, including QT interval prolongation, torsades de pointes or other ventricular arrhythmias, syncope, and cardiac arrest, with loperamide misuse and abuse, as reported by Medscape Medical News.  In 2017, the FDA added a warning to the product label about the risk of taking high doses of loperamide. 

The FDA notes that some individuals are taking higher-than-recommended doses of loperamide to treat symptoms of opioid withdrawal or to achieve euphoric effects of opioid use.
The maximum approved daily dose for adults is 8 mg/day for OTC use and 16 mg/day for prescription use. Loperamide is safe at these approved doses, but the FDA continues to receive reports of serious cardiac problems and deaths with much higher than the recommended doses of loperamide, primarily among people who are intentionally misusing or abusing the product, the agency said.
Packaging Could Help

Evidence suggests that package limitations and use of unit-dose packaging may reduce medication overdose and death, Dr Gottlieb said. Today the agency sent letters to OTC manufacturers requesting that they implement changes consisting of packaging limitations and unit-of-dose packaging.


""We're requesting that packages contain a limited amount of loperamide appropriate for use for short-term diarrhea according to the product label. One example is a single retail package containing eight 2-milligram capsules in blister packaging. We asked the manufacturers to take the necessary steps to implement these changes in a timely fashion to address these public health concerns,"" Dr Gottlieb said.
He said the FDA will also reach out to those who distribute loperamide online through retail websites to ask them to take voluntary steps to help address the problem of loperamide abuse. ""The abuse of loperamide requires the purchase of extremely large quantities. Often this is done through the purchase of large bottles of loperamide, which is a common configuration in which the pill form of the medication is currently packaged. Today's action is intended to change how the product is packaged, to eliminate these large volume containers. We know that many of the bulk purchases of these large volumes are being made online through major online web retailers,"" Dr Gottlieb explained.

I know I have. Burnt by dealers, middle men, cops, other junkies, etc. But has there ever been a time you just fucked yourself and no one to blame but you?

My example or story was a few months ago. I took my lunch break to pick up 2 buns. This was pretty normal. I had taken my break to pick up before, I'm able to do it in the amount of time needed, my guy picked up and was waiting for me. So I go, pick up, do a few on the way back to the train, and get on. Everything seems fine. All went well, right? Well...i get off at my stop and while I'm walking up to the doors, I realize my pack of smokes (which I put the buns in) wasn't in my pocket. I had put the pack in my hoodie pocket. I searched all my pockets like a crazy person, retraced my steps back, and get down in time to see the train pulling away. I realize the pack fell out while I was sitting on the train. Fuck. I just lost 16 bags. They're on this fucking train that just pulled off going to Penn Station. My mind is racing, trying to think what to do. There's a fucking pack of smokes sitting on that train with 5 cigs and 16 bags. I tried figuring out how I could get to that train before they cleaned it or someone swiped them. I thought maybe I could wait for the train to come back and catch it. But how would I know what train? Which car? Which track? There's no way I'd be able to find the right train at the right time AND someone hadn't picked them up already. I had no recourse. Not to mention I had to get back to work, so I couldn't just chill at the train station all day hoping the same train came back to this station. There was nothing I could do and they were gone, traveling the city by themselves on this train, destined to be someone else's high. 

The only thing I could think is ""someone is going to have a GREAT day finding that pack."" lol

So, ladies and gentlemen, was there ever a time you just fucked yourself and it was all on you? And stay safe!",1517336374.0

I understand the process of converting sticky/gummy tar into powder for the purpose of snorting, etc., but I recently came across some tar that is sold as a brown powder already. There are rocked bits here and there but for the most part it is just powder and is being sold as tar. My question is: what exactly does this indicate? From what I understand #3 looks very similar and has to be broken down with an acid before shooting. Does the consistency have to do with the manufacturing or is all tar sticky and then later turned into powder if/when cut? Also, is this snortable just as it is?",1517335818.0
