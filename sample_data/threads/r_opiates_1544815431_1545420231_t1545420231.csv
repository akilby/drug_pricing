Advice please <3,"TL;DR-- Currently at 4mg subutex per day with a maintenence script, free to lower at my own pace. How fast can it be done painlessly (but still finishing before July 2019)?

So i spent last summer trying to wean myself off Heroin after a rough 4 years of binging on and off-- I had relapsed during exam time (2nd year of Uni), and was desperate to quit after having BARELY scraped the grades I needed...

In summer I was doing fantastic, with 4 8mg subs i tapered down to 0.25mg per day (with mild w/d common, as it was rapid and with limited supply).... Then I relapsed after my Ex-girlfriend told me that she got raped (we started to see eachother again casually, after having gone no-contact initially... Then what she told me fucked me up pretty bad)--- I started taking shitloads of Kratom (like 30-60g a day with benadryl to counter the Nausea).

Then back in Uni in 3rd year, I run out of Kratom and avoid the withdrawals by picking up Heroin again-- and then sign up at a maintenance clinic (and if they werent so slow, I wouldn't have spent any time on Heroin!). Started at 4mg after induction, but was getting minor w/ds between doses. Then staying at the same dose about a month, the w/ds between doses subside and I start getting days where I puke randomly, so I decide its time to taper... how fast should I attempt to taper? I wanna be off by July at the latest, but also dont know how fast is too fast (IE becoming painful again)

Thanks if you read everything, this was also an opportunity to vent... have no one to talk to and i stopped looking at this subreddit so much :/

I just wanted to share my story, well rather my Moms story.

My Mom has been a user since she was 12. She grew up in a time (60s and 70s) where it was cool to shoot drugs and did all the hard stuff; anything from Coke to Speed to Acid to Herion. Her sister, my aunt, says that my Mom always did just the right amount to almost kill her (but not quite) and was really good about knowing her dose. She never OD'ed once before her death.

Mom loved Herion. She always said that and never denied it. It was her favourite drug up until the day she died. She was also an alcoholic and drank 1 and half bottles of wine the day she took the hit that took her life.

In the 90s she was very active with Narcotics Anonymous and was with the program for over 7 years on and off, and received her 2 year medallion before deciding she didn't need N/A anymore. My aunt says there really was never a time that my mom was clean, she had cheated several times within those two years of ""sobriety"".

She started Methadone in the 2000s and seemed to be doing pretty good. She got together with a man who was also an addict and decided they should live together. Well his drug of choice was also Herion, and not too long after that they began scoring every now and again. Mom never was honest with me about her drug use, most of the times that I found out she used again, it was by accident, she had let it slip out during one of our convos.

6 weeks ago she let it slip to her Methadone doctor that she messes around with her doses, some days only taking half of her dose and other days taking more (she always thought she could play doctor on herself) Well after that he stopped her carries and made her come in everyday. How dare he, she said. Ill get him. So she stopped methodone altogether. This is all unbeknown-st to me. I learned of this later from my Dad, who she had shared this story with.

In the week before her death she had started using Herion again. The night of her death she begged her junkie boyfriend to give her money so she could score. He gave her his bank card and told her to only take out $100. Well she apparently took out $200 and his the extra stash from him. Her boyfriend prepared the hits for them both. He shot up first, then she. He said he nodded out after because the next thing he remembers is waking up and finding my Mom lying on the bathroom floor, and she had already gone a little cold. He tried to wake her but after feeling how cold she was already, immediatly called the police. She had a needle in her arm and a spoon was nearby. He suspects she took another hit after the first one, and that hit was lethal.

When I went to confirm her identity at the funeral parlour before her cremation, she had a big bump on the top right side of her head. I suspect she hit the side of the tub on the way down to the floor. This whole situation is so heartbreaking to me, because I feel like she was caught up in her addiction her whole life and was never able to became free of it.

One thing I can say is she died doing the one thing that she loved most. 

Thanks for allowing me to share.

 25 years old - tried opiates (30mg oxycodones) for the FIRST time last year when I was on probation because I thought I could flush it in 3 days and was only being tested every 30 days, the habit progressed so fast within 3 months I was failing every test and couldn't clean up in the 30 days, 15+ failed DTs throughout a few month period after testing escalated, I ended up in a 6 month stint of outpatient programs, 3 times at the McGee unit. I detoxed cold turkey 3 times off a 120/200MG habit due to the circumstances of jail being the next option and I was NOT getting on another medication like Suboxone or methadone. I made it a few months and relapsed and violated and went to jail for 18 days, paid them 10k to get off probation a year early, my offense was hefty, (gnabbed with $50k+ of shatter on i80 coming from Cal). 

Anyways, I made a stupid ass choice to use again after having a good 3-4 months of pretty solid sobriety because me and my high school sweetheart of 10 years broke up, I lost my shit and started wyling with 30s and used heroin for the first time........... Went on from 1 bag a day to a bundle a day in 2 weeks and binged for about 2 months total.

I'm done with this lifestyle it is so far out from how I was raised and I truly am upsetting myself and everyone close to me, so I hit it cold turkey again, last dose was about 7 bags and it definitely was laced up with fent , anyway that was monday night at 10pm, it's been exactly 4 1/2 days. To be honest I think 60% of it was mental this time, unless it hasn't hit me for some reason yet? Which is what I was wondering? 24/48 hrs involved major anxiety some dry heaving and RLS, 48/ now I can keep down food and water and still definitely have some mild discomfort in my arms and legs, kinda cannot sit still and keep wanting to move around. Can someone enlighten me on what happens from here and make me feel better about this situation?

I'm 14 days clean now. It's good. It's nice not needing anything. It's nice not having a bad mood, not going to the pharmacy early, and not having to watch my drinking at social events due to the risk with significant opiates in my system.

I was on pills for 3 years. It was a tough break. I have risen in my career and become a different person. I didn't like the reliance. 

I grew lazy. I stopped doing CWEs. I bought top ups on the DWMs. I wasn't a good human. I remember holding a few g's of H and pouring it down the toilet. Hitting flush. Watching it spin. The next day I went through the garbage in the bathroom to put the bag in my mouth. It's not a good life. 

The other side.

It's about the same as you all remember. It's more social, there is more uninhibited drinking. You are able to let go. You're able to let go of your plans. Let go of the pill tracking or orders so you don't get sick. You get to take something that was in some control over your life and set it aside. 

There's not one opiate left in the house. My pain still exists, but I've discovered that the fire can be put out with some exercise. It's better for me. It doesn't push the pain away, it embraces it. 

You see. Life is suffering. This concept is fundamental. There is no joy found at the end of a needle, or at the center of a pill. And there is no joy on the other side, either. But that's OK. We're all in pain. We're all suffering. Suffering is what life is, and once we harness and fuel ourselves with this we can become better. 

I'm changed. You're all changed. But we forget that everyone is changed, daily. It's ok to change. It's ok to walk away from a shitty or unpleasant situation. Is it going to be comfortable? No, of course not. Nothing is. Nothing ever is. If you're comfortable you're not living, and if you're not living you're not suffering. 

When you're ready for change, positive change, you'll know. There's no parade at the end. There is no congratulations or accolades. We're all quiet in our addictions. And we're all quiet in our lives. What we need is to know that it's ok to not feel joy, and it's ok to be in pain: we all are. What we don't need, or, at least, what I've discovered I don't need, is the pressure, stress, and ultimately, a mere displacement of one type of pain for another. I'll take the pain that can be used. I'll take the pain of life as my fuel source. 

Happy holidays.

I can’t go out tonight to get more rigs. Gotta stay on the downlow at this apartment with family. So, I do have something that might work.
I have a supply of intramuscular syringes. They are filled with some blood pressure medication somebody in the apartment used to have to use, but he stopped using them and has all these IM syringes still in the sealed package, filled with old BP medication.
So, I think you can see where I am going with this. Can I empty these IM syringes and use them to shoot? I don’t see why it wouldn’t work. The needles are pretty big/thick, so it would hurt a lot more than an IV insulin needle, but it’s all I got atm so I gotta do with what I got. So, would this work? If not, why

Get in the mindset of creating value for whoever has what you need. 

Let me explain with my own personal experience. I’m admittedly a drug addict. I ask for fronts more times than not. I rarely get hit back up if I have nothing to offer. It’s not worth it for the dope man to waste his time/gas/energy getting drugs to me when he knows I’m just gonna end up buying from him later when I do have money. 

Anyways, long story short, now I hit him up when I have bud, or even just a few bucks and he’s on it. I know it’s not anything mind blowing or some excellent over the top copping tip. Just something to keep in mind to help you score easier..

so i roll my window down and motion him over. i give him a cig and ask him if he gets high. he looks surprised then says something about using pain killers and i ask if he uses dope and he nods. i gave him a bag and said “merry christmas and please be safe”. he smiled, thanked me, and told me to do the same. i know i didn’t do a lot for the dude or anything but i hope in some small way i made his night a little bit better. i know i’m not perfect and have a long way to go but compared to previous years i’m doing waaaay better this christmas. not looking for a pat on the back or anything like that but i’m hoping this post inspires someone to pay it forward and look out for someone else who is having a rough time. not to be cheesy but i really love this sub and the sense of community and support that i get from it. many of you have helped me immensely without knowing it. i hope everyone has a good holiday and a better new year. ❤️",1545364403.0

Small city tho so who knows


The local anaesthetic is slowly starting to wear off which means that my pain is getting like 10% worst every 15-30 minutes which is fucked.
Edit: it’s almost worn off and I am v sad.


And I’m fucking annoyed because all they will give me is 5mg of oxy and I’m just sitting here like 
“Jesus I’m not even an opiate addict but gosh dang guys
1. My natural tolerance to opiates is high as
2. Opiate tolerance is weirdly semi permanent 
3. I’ve been using a bunch of morphine over the past couple months, somewhere between once every 1-2 weeks.


The real reason I’m annoyed is my mate went to the hospital the other day for a minor wrist surgery and he said he had barely any pain and he just kept asking and they gave him around 50 mg of oxy over time
He ended up throwing up and ODing a bit because they gave him fent during the Op.


(Side note idk bout America but in Australia the nurses and even doctors know fuck all about doing all kind of drugs to anyone, almost everyone I hear about who goes through surgery ends up taking so much shit they throw up and the nurses are just like
“sorry lol that’s from the surgery”
but anyone who’s ever used knows differently)
Seems real disingenuous now that I think about it actually..


Seriously guys cmon I need like at least 15 to actually kill this pain.




P.S. has anyone else noticed opiate tolerance seems to go up a BUNCH more when you overdose compared to normie high rec doses?


P.P.S when I posted this to r/drugs some fuckhead who’d never done opiates in his life tried to tell me about opiate tolerance and since I’m in a lot of pain I’m pretty annoyed tonight all in all.
And that fucked me up because the one thing I hate above all else is people talking shit when they don’t even know what’s going on.
Reminds me of “mushrooms rot yer brain”

I know most people arent in the position to do so, but the best thing to do is cop once for a larger amount then nickel and diming dealers. Obviously you need to get an idea of how business savvy your dealer is before you decide to fuck with him, but I think it's important to find someone who buys an ounce or two at once to buy from. I live in the south and I can imagine the way to go about scoring dope varies from city to city, but I dont usually roll into open air markets unless I dont have a plug. Once I have one, I always call or text to arrange a meeting. I dont like trap setups, because they have the least care for customers and deal with broke vagrants. At the risk of sounding pretentious, I spend good money, and I'm not a street junkie, so if you bullshit me once and say you have quality product and it doesnt get me well, I'm not buying from you again. If you act like I'm inconveniencing you to bring you 270 dollars (my price for a 6.2 or a metric 'quarter' of tar, I'm not buying from you again. If you're in a major city you can find a good plug who's a straight shooter. 

Never blow the plugs phone up, makes u look desperate, and honestly texting him to let him know how shitty his dope is, is also working against you. Actions speak louder, if you spend good money, once u stop buying from them they will be wondering why the fuck you arent buying from them and a smart dealer will do what's necessary to keep you as a custo.

Also a tip, with a dealer you dont trust or you just started buying from, I think its smart to not tell them what you want exactly, give them an idea or range of what you might get. Again, this wont work if you're spending bullshit amounts of money, but if you spend good money, roll up and then tell him you want a dime of the shit to push off before you buy a larger amount, you can ensure it's good dope obviously and if you never tell them a specific amount until you arrive, you know he wont try and (for example) weigh up some shit and then cut it",1545313904.0

After about a half hour goes by and I head back to my room and see it gettin torn apart by nurse aides and the director. Jokes on them, the xanax is behind the clock in the rec room I say to myself. I was then informed I'd be taking a drug test. No problem I say, they stood behind the door as I poured my cup of piss into the test bottle.

The results showup within 10 mins, all panels are clean. I ask for an apology and go on my way.",1545313713.0

So they offered me a nerve block before the surgery which I declined because I knew if I got that I wouldn’t get anything really for pain when I woke up since they’d know it’s numb (I had this happen when I got ankle surgery). So I didn’t take anything since the day before. I felt ok wds didn’t kick in before I went under, and last thing I took was like 1mg sub about 20 hours prior. So when I woke up I was in extreme pain, like moaning pain. They quickly came and gave me a shot of dilaudid but it did nothing, I have no idea the mgs though. They immediately gave me another when they saw it didn’t effect me and also gave me 20mg oxy by mouth. I told them I always had a high tolerance for meds. Anyways the pain settled a bit but I felt basically nothing from it. My habit is 90mg oxy/day when I can afford it and I take it all at once not spread out. I can only get high once per day otherwise I just waste money. So idk if the 1mg sub fucked with me or if it was just my tolerance but I doubt that because a few months before that I went to hospital (I have herniated discs) because my back was killing me and my foot was numb(I had a compressed nerve that gave me drop foot) and they gave me a shot of morphine and god damn I was flying! So I doubt it was my tolerance since I had the same habit then. That was my first time getting dilaudid too so idk what happened. It stopped wds from coming and killed some pain but no high at all, what a bummer it was, I was looking forward to that surgery just to wake up and receive iv opiates lmao. I’ve never used a needle myself only hospital settings so it’s a rare treat for me. Anyways there’s my story and wondering if anyone knows how that could’ve happened? I’m guessing they may have given me something while I was under so like I said I won’t get high once I have opes in me unless I take at least 2-3x the first dose of the day. Oh and they sent me home with only 40 perc 5s and my follow up appt he only gave me 30 perc 5s and then nothing after that lol drs are so scared nowadays to prescribe them. ",1545295013.0

Successful first cold cop. Right on right?! 

Wrong. I made a handful of mistakes and was very lucky I rolled up on the 57 year old easy goer that I did. 

Dilly dallying looping the service drive bridges to get back to this guys expressway corner, looking like a straight amateur. 

I let my money walk. About a half a block. 

I know, I know... 

60 bones. 20 for you, 40 for me. 

This guy had me park on the fucking service drive. Idk if everybody here lives in an area in order to understand what the service drive is, maybe I just don’t travel a lot... BUT YOU DON’T PARK THERE. 

He walks up the street, a little shitty green car scoops him, sits for about 5 seconds, and punches it in reverse down the side street it popped out from 😕

Welp. You let your money walk. Have fun getting that back right? I’m in disbelief for a solid 2 minutes. Then I proceed to turn down that same street and look for this car - LOL 

Looping and driving around the hood, losing my way, I’m so frustrated I just say fuck it. I learned my lesson. Embarrassed that I’d have to come back here and tell you guys how fucking stupid I was, I turn back onto the main road that takes me to my expressway entrance. 

I see this motherfucker walking across the bridge. 

So I’m on his ass, roll up like “DAWG WTF” 

Turns out he was looking for me the whole time 😩😩 
Had my 2, and his 1. Super fucking nice guy. Railed his amount right in front of me. 

I definitely got ripped off, amount wise. Even for $40 if I included his bag. But my foots in the door. I’m familiar now, I know somebody. I’ll get this guys number eventually (the dealer not the homeless guy haha) 

He said he had other plugs that take longer to set up, where I can buy in larger amounts, so maybe I’ll buy this dude some lunch at Mickey D’s or something and wait on a whole gram. 

All in all, I’m a fucking idiot, I got shook, and it was more “real” than I expected - but by the graces of JJ, and this empathetic old homeless guy who knew the position I was in, I was ever so slightly blessed. 

Now time to unwrap this shit and see what it’s all about, because I’ve been itching to tell y’all about this so I can finally get high after a long nights work + an hour of driving.

Today is 38 days sober from everything except THC. In the time since, I’ve used a Benzo 3 times, so you know, I’m doing decent. 

Some background info before I go into my good news. ~Will TL;DR at bottom~

My first job ever was in a hair salon as a Shampoo Girl, and it was and is my absolute favorite of all of my jobs and work positions that I’ve ever had. So I started there in 2014 but didn’t start using heroin or hard drugs at all except marijuana until 2016. Around 2017 is when my use escalated by starting IV usage. 

I should add the fact that I worked at the salon for about 2 years consecutively, and after that I would fill-in, aka work certain days and cover certain shifts for other Shampoo girls whenever need be. But ever since mid-end 2017, evidently my boss knew about my use, even though at that point I had only peaked or plateau-ed in my H addiction, even though I WOULD show up high to work occasionally and some days spend 15 minutes in the bathroom doing lines before I started IVing in her bathroom, though that was only the last 3 times I filled in. Regardless, there were pretty obviously signs so it’s not even like a “HOW DID SHE FIND OUT?! Hur dur!” type thing.

I had only learned about her knowledge of it this past year, 2018, when I decided to come clean to her, but like I said she already knew, if not had a strong suspicion. She’s an approximately 65 year old Chinese woman who’s had/ owned her own salon since ‘74, came to America when she was 12, and is overall just an incredibly sweet, intelligent, brutally honest, successful, God-fearing woman. Anyways,

Earlier today a little after I woke up and took a bar and a 1/4th I decided to call a few salons near me to see if anyone needed receptionist or shampoo help, to no avail. So I said, “Fuck it, why not call Hoy (old boss and owner whom I described) and say hello, inform her about my sobriety, and see if I can start filling in again?”—so I did. 

I could quote our conversation, but in a nutshell she said that my days of sobriety were amazing and that she’s extremely proud and that she/ the salon will need help this Friday so I can come in for a few hours!! I am so fucking stoked! The best part, though, was that she was looking though her calendar and after she said I can come Friday, she said, “I think we’ll be okay Saturday, but we’ll talk more in person.” (Regarding me working more days)  !!!!!! 

I AM SO HAPPY! There *REALLY TRULY* is a light at the end of the addiction-tunnel! I swear. 


I would like to proclaim that I am in no way preaching, bragging, etc., because first of all I only have about 40 days, it’s not like it’s 5 years. Secondly I was in a lot of people’s shoes a month or two or three ago, so it’s not like that at all. The only points of my post were: 

1) To show some of y’all that things REALLY DO get better once you achieve somewhat sobriety— you don’t have to stop everything, just baby steps!


2) Sharing my good news with you guys because I really am ecstatic and I think I can finally redeem myself in her (my employer’s) eyes! God... Once more, things get so much better y’all! 

TL;DR: 38 days Heroin free today and I am able to fill in again at my favorite as well as first job for a day, and more than likely a few more future days!! Also, please don’t lose hope in anything, but especially sobriety or addiction-wise. Things really do get better, but to be bluntly honest, you have to help yourself. There’s a saying my mom always quotes, and even if you don’t believe in God you can still interpret it and make it relevant: 

“God helps those who help themselves.” 

Bless y’all, stay safe and let me know if any of y’all have received good news lately, be it a hooked up sack, deals on bags, job advancement, whatever! Spread some good vibes 💖😀🥰

I’m usually a lurker on this sub and log in multiple times a day to check out the dope porn on here. Today though, I’d love some help from this community to help me get off methadone.

I am from the U.K. (I won’t be anymore specific than that) and have been on a methadone maintenance program for 10 years. I’m 33 and started using heroin from 15 years old. I quit the H due to me destroying my childhood and being at rock bottom. My family saved me. My first son was born and the very first week of his life, I decided to pack the Heroin in and went on a MM program. 

It’s been a long time on Methadone, I don’t have anymore cravings for H at all (even looking at these pics on here don’t make me want to shoot a wrap) I’ve even had old friends smoke crack and H in front of me and I never felt like asking them for a hit. I know I’ll never ever go back to that life. However, this methadone feels like it’s 100 times worse than being on H. I started off my dose at 120ml per day oral solution 10 years ago and gradually reduced my dosage over time. Problem is the past 4 years I can’t reduce lower than the 40ml a day I’m currently on. I have tried reducing 1ml a fortnight but I get mild withdrawals which I can’t shake off.

What I’d love is to be drug free. I just can’t shake off this last 40ml a day I’m currently on. Tapering down hasn’t worked. I have also tried subutex by dropping my methadone intake to 30ml then withdrawing for 40 hours then popping an 8mg subutex. I don’t know if I waited long enough but as soon as I took the subutex, I went into an induced rapid withdrawal state instantly which knocked me for six. It scared the living crap out of me and after multiple calls to my key worker, I got another dose of methadone which made me feel better after 2 days. 

What’s the best way to get off this drug? Any alternative drugs or multiple alternatives I can take to get completely off everything?

Please, any help will be really appreciated. ",1545289805.0

So I’ve shot H a handful of times, and have always stuck to smoking. 

I love the whole process, I love the taste, chasing it down with the tooter(straw) when it runs down the foil, holding in the smoke until I ghost it. The little crinkling of foil, that amazing shiver that runs through your whole body when you go from sick to well after your first couple of hits. Yum.

I just love the whole ritual of smoking. I know there’s a ritual with shooting too, but I’ve always just liked smoking a lot more, regardless of how I’m “wasting” it or how it could be hitting me a lot harder.

It’s not really even the increased risk of overdosing with shooting, or how it makes it a lot easier to spot because of track marks on your arms. I just genuinely enjoy the ritual of smoking a lot more.

Just felt like I had to share with y’all! Can anyone relate? What’s your favorite ROA?

Brick, Bundle, Bag: 
https://i.imgur.com/wA8H0az.jpg

Among many things, one of the things I find very interested is how different regions, states, cities, and even blocks each store and market their dope (and drugs in general) so differently.  And when it comes to dope, it’s drastically differently. I find it extra strange why dope is so heavily marketed where I come from but none of the other drugs do this.  I do live in the major metropolitan people, and hour from and surrounded by millions of people and also what’s been calls the dope capital of the states.

Here’s a great example.  In the one pic you’ll see a brick (5 bundles...50 bags total).  You can ONLY buy a bag, a bundle (10 bags), a brick (5 bundles, 50 bags) or a sleeve (10 bricks).  It’s really difficult, though possible, to get loose raw dope.  You need to be or know someone pretty connected.  I do know people that get loose raw and what they call “fent powder” which is what they cut their raw dope with to bulk it out.  It’s really “designed” as a bulking agent and not as a potency increaser...the idea being you can bulk out your dope and not lose potency.  But this stuff is not mixed or purchased by chemists or anything like that.  Just a dealer that likely runs his or her own trap and bags stuff up and stamps himself.

It’s not weighed out, some traps weigh out each bundle and then use the same scooper each time to fill the bags, so you’ll always get the same weight per bundle but never per bag (these are usually small level dealers as this takes time).

Most guy buy an ounce of whatever, bulk to out, and give a bunch of girls the same scooper and tell them to get to work.  Scoop fill, fold, tape, bundle, brick, sleeve it.  Assembly line style.  I’ve seen this in action once and it’s INCREDIBLE how much product they pump out.  And they have numerous runners immediately moving retail
Product into other traps or immediately to their lieutenants for steeet distro.  It’s a business...and boy oh boy and girl oh girl so they make BAAANK with these.  

It’s why I laugh when I see in the news the cops spent 10 months and like a million dollars to take down a trap house where they were bagging it up.  Cause there’s literally thousands and thousands of traps.  The cops don’t even make a dent in the market.  It’s a complete waste of time.

Where I’m from the Bloods really control the retail / street level distribution..I mean obviously you can find a bunch of different people in each town that do their thing but more often than not if you go up their chain you’ll find a fly dressed blood eventually.  Which seems to be a good thing as they have this stuff locked down.

But I digress...what does the storage, sales, and marketing of dope look like in your area (please don’t share the area)",1545283724.0

And honestly, I fucked up. I gave in so easily that it’s pretty pathetic. Before making the 45 minute drive to the hospital that my program takes place, I stopped to get back a tool that I let a friend borrow. I could have gone the rest of my life without this tool. It was an excuse that I used to stop in to my buddy’s house that I know always has heroin. My higher power gave me every opportunity to not use. I spent an hour trying to wake my buddy up because he was nodding super hard. Then when he woke up, he told me he was out of dope. I could have taken either of those things as a chance to leave with my tiny bit of clean time in tact. But I was still in the acute withdrawal phase and I let that voice in the back of my head not only speak, I handed him a fucking megaphone to tell me how much better I would feel. When my buddy asked for a ride to score, I looked at the clock and knew I could either get to the program on time and do the right thing, or I could give him a ride to score, but maybe I could go and not use. The correct choice was not made. I have him a ride knowing damn well that it was going to cost me the minute amount of self respect I had gained in the last couple days. We met his guy and had what was probably the quickest and easiest pickup I have ever been involved with. The resistance I felt earlier from above was no longer present, as deep down I knew my choice had been made hours ago. Within minutes of pulling into the spot, I was tasting the all too familiar flavor of failure. With every hit I took, my shame grew exponentially. I awaited a high that never came. The human mind is stronger than any drug could ever be. Instead of slipping into that warm and fuzzy euphoria, I found myself so stressed out that it felt like I had forced myself into withdrawals. When I arrived at treatment, it was already the lunch break. I sat in the waiting room, killing time with emails and phone calls for work. Faces that had become familiar over the last couple of days came and went. They all seemed to radiate with this confidence that they had earned by getting clean time under their belt. It was a confidence I longed for, but hadn’t earned yet. A few greeted me, asking about where I was for the morning session. As I do while under the influence, I lied to them to protect the drugs. Unable to meet their conversations with eye contact, I hoped they would move along. My shame must have been palpable. If they could tell, they didn’t tell. During the afternoon session, we went around the room and talked briefly about how we were feeling and how long we have been clean. The people around me were beaming with pride as they spoke of their amazing moods, and about how their sobriety was beginning to mend their relationships. A girl that spoke a couple people before me, unashamedly told the group that she had restarted her clean time due to a slip up. Nobody judged her. She wasn’t crucified. She was lifted up and told that it’s a part of the process. It finally came to me. I stuttered my way through some bullshit....blah blah blah. And then it came to my clean time. The door was open for honesty. My chance to grow and begin to change. All eyes on me. Like a fucking coward, I said 4 days. 4 fucking days!!!! It hadn’t even been 4 hours. The final group session covered the topic of sociopaths and narcissism. Hearing about these horrible character flaws started making me feel sick. The people he was describing sounded like monsters. My stomach began to turn as the realization set in that he was painting a picture that was starting to look like me. Had I really allowed myself to become a monster? When I tuck my kids in at night and I check for monsters under their bed or in the closet, should I be checking in the mirror? Tomorrow, I am going to be into treatment on time. And when they ask how I am feeling, I am going to tell them that I don’t want to be the monster. When they ask about my clean time, I will admit that it can only be measured in hours. I am going to start the process of change. I am going to start healing. And one day, I will look people in the eyes when I speak. And the monster under the bed won’t be my reflection.",1545283601.0

Hope it's alright to post this here, desperately need to vent and get some shit off my chest. Long read though, thanks in advance to anyone who makes it through.

I got fucking ripped off the other day and really think this is the nail in the coffin of my drug career.

Quick backstory: I'm 32yo male in \[northeastern city\]. Recently out of a long-term relationship. I have a pretty good job in media, a decent apartment in a safe neighborhood, a handful of friends. I've been in recovery for five years. Super long story short I've been clean nine months, life is good but I had a massive anxiety attack about some life stuff coming up and decided I would get high. This entailed rescheduling my 12/15 vivitrol shot for after the weekend, under great protest and suspicion from my doctor. But I had built enough goodwill at this point to get away with it.

I called my blues connect (always my DOC) way out in the sticks and picked up 5 after work Friday. Did my little pre-ritual on the train out there, drinking my diet tonic water and white graprefruit juice and munching zantac to potentiate. I get the blues, all good, head home and take them over the course of a night. Decent feeling, not nearly the bliss I remembered and hoped for. Well, I've already decided to slip so Saturday I call my old scumbag uptown H guy because he's available basically 24/7 and has good prices (but worse product). He dicks me around for awhile until I give up and try my reliable H guy. He delivers, the stuff is very good, I spend the day / night sniffing and getting high, it's more or less what I wanted. Now it's Sunday. I finish the last of the bag in the early afternoon. Now My vivitrol shot is in 24 hours. Having been through every iteration of this scenario in the past, I am confident I will be able to get the shot with minimal adverse reaction. Heroin stays in your system a brief time, I didn't use enough to get dependent, and I'd been clean for quite awhile. I am not afraid.

And yet. I decide as a contingency plan to have my unreliable H dealer meet me around 2pm, right after my meeting gets out. In case the vivitrol has a bad reaction at least I can somewhat negate it with the H.

I go to the doc's office. He doesn't ask to drug test me as I just saw him last week and passed. We talk for awhile, I let my stupid pride and ego stop me from admitting my slip and he gets ready to give me the shot. I get a text from my H guy. ""Emergency has come up"", he won't be available until 7pm. The window for any opiates to have any effect at that point will be basically closed. Too late to back out, I get the shot.

Within 30min I am in agony. I barely get the cab back to my apartment before I have to rip off all my sweat-drenched clothes. Full-blown PWD. I'll spare the details. On a scale of 1-10, 1 being mild discomfort and 10 being involuntary shitting / vomit, this was a 7. Desperate, I call my H guy. No answer. Call blues guy. No answer. Beg my unreliable H guy to let me meet him sooner. He says no but he'll be ready at 7 on the dot.

Hours pass. I give in and call my doctor to fess up, he is cool about it and writes me a scrip for klonopin and clonodine. I somehow walk half a mile to the pharmacy and collect. It helps a little. Unreliable H guy calls to confirm I'll be there at 7. I say yes. I call an expensive-ass Uber I can't afford because I am barely alive and take the hour ride uptown.

It's 7:15. I tell him I've arrived. It's 30 degrees with high winds. He tells me to wait in front of a store. 5min later I call him, he tells me he's hit some traffic but should be there ""15-20"" (we all know what that means). During all this, some sketchy older guy comes over to me and asks if he can use my phone as he's supposed to 'meet a friend'. We talk around each other for a minute until its clear he's a user and he has a guy nearby that's ready now. Sick and cold and desperate I give him $40, he tells me to wait around the corner. I assume I just lost $40. Thankfully he returns with 8 stamps. Half the going price apparently. I give the guy 3 and take the other 5. Immediately snort two and feel massive relief. No more shooting stomach pains. Thinking half a bun might be enough, I head back to the subway for the long ride home.

Unreliable H guy calls me, says he's a block away. I tell him I got hooked up elsewhere but still have $40 and could get a half from him. He grumbles about me copping from someone else but agrees to meet me. I turn around on the train. As I'm getting off the train he calls me and says ""hey bro since you're already good I think I'm gonna head out, hit me up tomorrow."" I freak out and tell him he made me wait over five hours to see him, I took an uber up, and the only reason I copped from someone else is because he was late and I was hurting. He agrees to see me but only if I buy a whole bun for $80 but he'll throw in half an extra for the hassle. I agree.

He ends up making me wait another 20 minutes until he finally comes to see me. Hands me a bag like normal, tells me ""get home safe"" and dips. I walk a block before examining. The dude gave me a bun and a half of empty stamp bags. Of course when I call him he'd already blocked me.

There is a slightly happy ending. I was able to find the guy from earlier and buy 5 more bags. Also when I got home I had coincidentally received an unexpected check from an employer for $90 so basically broke even for the night (minus Uber ride). I still don't understand why though. Met up with that dude dozens of times over the years. Never acted like a fiend or was short with money. I've been ripped off many times before but this time seemed particularly evil. Motherfucker couldn't even give me a couple full bags?

Anyways, I went home, woke up feeling like I was in WD and had to call out of work. Two days later and I still feel like a schizo.

It was just a psychotic couple days. I thought I could dip my toe back into the world of using, just a brief respite from my problems, then go back to recovery but NOPE. Within a couple days I was dopesick, literally giving junkies money to cop for me right out in the open and getting robbed. Another week of that? Probably would have fucked up christmas, spent my rent money, and ended up detoxing over New Years so I could start work clean.

Nothing can compare to the high of opiates but the cost is too great. I can't do this shit anymore. I have to stop deceiving myself I can go back 'just once'. Sober life can be boring and tedious but can also be incredibly rewarding and enjoyable and fulfilling.

NEVER get a vivitrol injection if you've had opiates within the last 48 (but ideally 72) hours. Physical dependency doesn't matter.

Thanks for reading. Happy holidays.

a7swbl,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/a7swbl/i_have_this_dream_sometimes/,16,https://redd.it/a7swbl,ASavageLost,I have this dream sometimes.,"I am open for business, now. Customers show up one by one. These are the faithful.  They practice a chemical religion and daily make this solemn faced pilgrimage, seeking absolution from me, their priest, in this stinking room as if it were some sweaty confessional where their souls might be saved. There is no crucifix made of metal on the wall, just the icon of a cold, dirty pistol under the bed. Sometimes, I feel the power of it all. Like I’m holding this throttle of evil power, and I let it open till nothing’s held back. Then, sometimes, I can see it for what it really is, and all that it will cost me, like my life is just a black and whispering vein pumping misery through this black creature called time.

I’m feeling kind of bad, thinking about all of it, but eventually, Peanut Boy comes by with Barbie. They usually get a gram or two. They always make me laugh, too. A large black man comes in after they leave. He talks, thinks and has all the affectations of a mentally disturbed and heroin addicted teenage girl, like he is legitimately a young female stuck in this huge man’s body. The man buys his and is gone. A transexual, who Eddie calls ‘Shoelace,’ shows up from her room across the parking lot with grease clots in her skin and stubbly scabbed patches of beard shaped like countries on a map I’ve never seen. She tries to lure me back to her room with a piece of banana Laffy Taffy every time I see her. I turn her down this morning. I always do.

Eddie is in and out, but I’m always giving him his daily amount to work out of and he gives me the cash for whatever I gave him the day before. It’s usually a half ounce for him. Other bicycle and flashlight people come in for smaller amounts. They wear three or four hoodies one on top of the other. Some carry worn trunks full of broken things or wrap themselves in headphone cords and duct tape. I usually only sit here until 12 and let Eddie handle the business from his room after that, but in the five hours or whatever it is I usually sit here, I make anywhere between 700 to 1500 dollars. That’s every day and not counting Eddie or the people who get quantity like Sharky or Cheese or Martin from me after I’m done here.

My old friend Wendy shows up. We met when I was coming back up after that stint in California I’ve told you about and got lost in north Oregon for a few months. I had five pounds of frozen fish sticks which I was looking to sell, but I was walking by these food carts, when I got distracted by this great idea. It was that there might be a propane cannister I could steal and return for the deposit, so I stepped through the bushes to look. Instead, I found this guy jabbering at Wendy in the morning light next to a puddle of blood and what appeared to be three or four stolen bikes all disassembled into their smallest pieces and scattered across the pavement. They both looked like they’d spent the whole night licking their lips off.

Anyway, that evening I talked her into buying a pack of cigarettes and smoked them while she was sleeping. Back then, she had a boy’s haircut and claimed to be a lesbian but let me hold her hand and shared her red sleeping bag with me until she vomited all over it on Burnside a few days later. We gave up and hitchhiked back up here after that. Once she got to town, some dramatic scenario left her with two badly broken legs. I think a car hit her or someone threw her out of a second story window. Something like that. Wendy doesn’t talk about it, and I can’t remember. Either way, she ended up in the wheelchair. It was only supposed to be temporary. Maybe a few months. She got used to it, though, and never got back out of it. It’s been over nine years.

After I help roll her backwards into the room, I look down at her and smile.

“Wow! It’s good to see you Wendy. Too wild. Who’d’ve thought?”

“Yeah. I heard this was the place to come these days, but the guy only worked from dawn to noon every day.”

“Well, there’s always Ed down the way. Just a few rooms over. He can always take care of you.”

“I’ve seen him a few times. He’s the one who told me. You know how I am, though, Randy! I want to meet the head honcho. Always have.”

“That’s true.”

“Something told me I was about to run into you.” Wendy claims to be psychic or clairvoyant, but just slightly. It’s hard for me to believe that kind of thing. She always says she’s had a premonition after the fact.

“Really? Well, here I am.”

“Yes. You are. Remember when I used to be your look out?”

“Oh man!”

“I know. Look at you now, kid. You’ve come a long way. You’re a big shot, now.”

“Guess I am. Guess I am.”

“Well, how do ya feel?”

“I don’t know. The same, I guess.”

I give her a gift and we talk for a while. She tells me about life on the streets and what that’s like for her these days and about some charges she’d caught. When I look at my phone it says that it’s a quarter to noon and I fidget a bit while she talks. Finally, I tell her that I have to get going, so we hug and say our goodbyes, but as I help her out of the door, Sal is standing outside. He looks like he’s been standing there a while and waiting. Wendy gives me a worried look when she sees him.

“What’s up Junky Vonnegut?” It sounds like a cold accusation. We never meet here anymore. It’s always at Dee Dee’s mom’s place.

“Sup, Sal?”

“Nothing man. Just came by looking for a little bit bigger piece than usual.” He usually only gets a couple grams at the most.

“Yeah. I think I can do that for you. This is Wendy. She was just leaving.”

“Yeah. Gotta get going. See you. Remember what I said, Randy. Be careful.” She never said anything about being careful.

“Okay. See you, Wen.” I say and hug her, again. I turn to Sal. We walk in together. “What were you with Sharky for last night?”

“Oh, man. You know. Just doing our thing, bro. We’ve been working hard out here. Got some bigger clients now. That’s why we got what we got last night and gotta get this issue right here.”

“I didn’t know you guys were that tight.”

“Yeah. Man. What? You think I’d just drop some stranger off in your lap like that, man? Not me!”

“I just didn’t know. What you looking for?”

“I need a zip.”

“An ounce?”

“Yeah.”

“Okay.”

I sit down and get the scale out and weigh one out for him out of the bag I just got from Old Man earlier this morning. Sal holds it up and studies it. He laughs.

“Nice, man. Real nice.”

“Yeah.”

“Well, I gotta get out of here. Hit me up later. Or I’ll hit you up.”

We bump knuckles. He slams the door. I head back to the apartment, but before I can get to the street, my mind slips away from me for a minute. It falls into another one of its fevered imaginations. Several homeless addicts limp toward me in the murk and gloom of the parking lot fog, like war wounded victims stuck in the smoke of some fiery apocalypse. They don’t speak, but I can tell they want to buy. I wave them off. One snaps like a dog, and another laughs. More of them appear out of the fog, like images of dark, afflicted figures visiting me from the mist or lost angels forming themselves out of nothing and disappearing back into the ether from which they coalesced.

Now, I am stepping off the curb. A sick tree’s roots suck dust and rock at my feet between the pavement. In the distance where it is harder to see there is a pair of women. They pick through the trash like rubble. They cry and pull out their hair. Slaves from the time of some black emperor. This is too much for me today. It’s time for me to get back to the apartment and get mine, to numb myself from the horror of this hell with the very thing that has brought it into my life.

Heroin.

I have this dream sometimes.

That my life is this weird sitcom that plays on network television every Thursday night. It’s a national favorite. I star as the red headed, only child of the family, sort of a spoof of Beaver Cleaver or Dennis the Menace or something like that. Canned laugher plays after everything I say and do in the dream. There are different sounds and music that cue any time my dad or mom come into my room. They are still married on the show, even though they sleep in different beds. My uncle Benny is the angry neighbor.  My grandmother makes a guest appearance as an old rescue from the pound in a two-part episode. I get stuck in a well, and she saves me. The second installment has the highest ratings of any show in the history of all the networks in my dreamland. A car hits her and kills her before the next episode airs. It’s how they write her off the show.

But for the rest of the week, when no one is watching, I see what everyone does behind the scenes. There is no laughter. There is no music. No one ever breaks character, but they show their true colors. My mother is really having an affair with my uncle. Both of them are evil. I can never find my dad in the maze of facades and props. Anyway, halfway through the second season, the producers get rid of me. There are some issues with my brain, so they bring in an older boy with brown hair to replace me.

For the rest of the dream, I’m stuck in this dark room watching marathons of the show. The theme song still plays. The laughter continues. The plots unfold, and credits roll. Then another episode starts, and my replacement gets the laughs and love that belong to me. No one even notices it’s someone else playing my part. They don’t care. My replacement looks right into the camera after every joke, because he knows I’m watching. I cry. I yell at the TV.

And that’s never a fun one to wake up from, because the residual feelings are so heavy, but that’s how I wake up this afternoon. It’s Thursday. Sometime around three. I reupped with Old Man this morning for the first time since Sunday when he invited me to his daughter’s birthday party. My work at room 127 of the Lindell Motel went well. The kid, Charlie, hasn’t been back since he left with Sharky and Sal that night. His ex-sister-in-law has introduced me to four other strippers, though, and her boyfriend. They all buy from me now. I’ve been back to the strip joint where she works every night to sell to them, but I haven’t seen Breezy. That’s okay, though. Tonight’s the night we’re supposed to meet by the Seattle wheel. Tonight’s the night she’ll be dressed in white. At least, that’s what she said.

The building has good heating systems. My apartment feels great. Grey clouds sit over the city. There are droplets of drizzle sprinkled on the window. I sit on the couch for a minute, still waking up. I pinch the bridge of my nose and use my thumb and finger to work the white bacon bits from my eyes. There is little in life as satisfying as removing the crusted buildup of your own bodily excretions from your body. It’s nice sitting here in the warm afterglow of the hit I did earlier. The altoid can sits on the coffee table in front of me. My spoon and syringe are next to it. There is my ashtray full of crumpled butts. I think about doing another hit, but it’s probably not a good idea if I’m going to meet this girl in a few hours. Better hold off, and I do. No one has called. No messages on my phone.

I walk down to the street and grab a coffee from a store on the corner. Days like these are my favorite to walk around in. It’s cold and grey and drizzling. Something about it makes you feel like your insides are a warm home with a fire burning and family talking about their days. Maybe that doesn’t make sense, but it does to me. That’s how it makes me feel stepping around puddles in a dismal Pacific Northwest day like this. Besides, the coffee is warmer and tastier in contrast to the elements, and another block down, I step into a thrift store. It is full of dead people’s things and the physical evidence of forgotten childhoods. Worn blackened tennis shoes of every size lie on top of an old table. There are a few bikes. One has training wheels. An old hospital bed hides behind some old dressers and a few desks and a teddy bear with its eye missing watches me from the checkout counter. Tangles of wires and out dated electronics hang from a shelf. Bed frames and a few mattresses lean against the back wall. Most of the floor space is a stifling maze of clothes racks. It all has that smell of old mothballs and sloughed, dead skin cells stuck in the worn cotton.

a7suv5,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/a7suv5/i_need_advice_on_my_detox_plan/,4,https://redd.it/a7suv5,Username503ird,I need advice on my detox plan..,"I was on 1/2 8mg sub a day, sometimes a full depending on how I felt . I’d take a half in the morning, half in the evening. Did this for 3yrs. Was sick and tired of it, and how much I’ve read about Suboxone withdrawal being hellish and worse than dark I just wasn’t ready for a month long detox.
Anyhow, fell into using 30mg oxy again, and again back to using Dark. We have black tar out here.. 
I use about 3G’s every 3-5days. Been using now for about 3months. Habits increased because I can afford it. But, I need to quit this weekend or next. I’ll have an extended weekend due to the holidays. 
So.. in my quit kit I have .. suboxone, 2mg Xanax bars, Gabapentin, and lots of Kratom I’ve ordered offline(Green Strains, and 2 other types I think white and red.) 
Anyhow my question is how and when should I go about taking these things to make myself the most comfortable I can, since I have them. Are they safe to take in conjunction with each other?? I’ll have some
Benedryl and Tylenol or Alieve and whatever Over The Counter crap I need as well. Plus planning on eating good multi vitamins and eating well from now up until then, and as much as I can during the bullsh!t...
Normally when I go to quit, i use heavy all morning and take my last dose around 2p and take a small piece of a Xanax bar to try to get to sleep early that day, in hopes I’ll sleep all night and in as late as possible. To make it to the 24hr mark and be able to take a piece of my sub.. crazy how strong our mind is, I usually wake up at like 4a and feel super shitty just cause I know I’m quitting and not gonna be able to reach over for my dope. 
Plan is to only use them all for the first couple-few days.. maybe the kratom a couple days thereafter If I’m still a wreck.
I’ve played this game for years, been an addict for 8-9yrs now and withdrew in all situations. At home, in jail multiple times(which seems to be easiest for some reason,) I’m just ready to give it up again. I’ve got these babies to live for and finally got the job I’ve been shooting for in the union. 
I know this page is all for using, but I figure I can get some educated advice from my fellow users on here and what their experiences are. I’ve never taken gabapentin and kratom only once. All and any advice would be greatly appreciated. 
Thanks, an merry Xmas errrybody!! ",1545268970.0

So my typical use is about 1g of west coast black tar per day, for about the past 4 years.
Its time to stop and save some money, luckily I have access to subs and have some comfort meds like clonidine, gabapentin, baclofen, and 8 Vicodin.

I always fail the first day because I can't make myself wait 24-36 hrs to induce Suboxone. It takes me about 24-36 hours to get sick enough to take a sub. I've tried the Bernese method but gave up the second day because I wanted to keep getting high.


I want to try again but with a modified taper

Day 1: 0.8g H
Day 2: 0.5g H
Day 3: 0.2g H & some kratom
Day 4: 4 Vicodin & kratom
Day 5: 2 Vicodin & kratom & gabapentin
Day 6: 1mg sub, slowly working up to 2-3mg over the next day or so


Thoughts? I'm on day 3 right now. I'm wondering if 4 Vicodin and some Kratom will be enough to keep me well, and if taking sub after tapering down to Vicodin will put me in precipitated withdrawal.

I was slightly concerned but i also carry narcan on hand and theres ppl watching me so i should be okay.

I could definitely see this becoming a habit so im only gonna buy a point and just have a happy pain free couple of days.

Unlike other opiate pills this seems to be less sedative and i feel more functional on it.

Tan powder. Kinda powdery kinda rocky. The tan/brownish stuff is #4 right? This is good. My whole body just feels so good. I see how this fucks ppl lives up. I might've took a bit too much of a bite off the forbidden fruit this time but i dont feel guilt or regret. Is what it is ya know.

If this post breaks rules or something along those lines, feel free to delete it. I'd also appreciate no negative comments even though that statement alone is asking for people to make negative comments, but I've come to like this community even though I'm not a user perse (I don't have a problem with those that do use; live and let live, right?)

Anyway on to my issue, I have chronic pain which I take the patch for and OCD and generalized anxiety disorder and a bitch' case of social anxiety which is what the clonazepam is for. Are there days you ever just hate yourself? I hate living three days at a time just waiting to put another patch on. I hate taking clonazepam just so I can get out of bed and not have feel this paralyzing feel of dread, my heart racing, and me just generally freaking out. I hate that my wife hates that I take all these ""narcotics""; I fucking hate that word. She just doesn't understand that I need these meds to function like a normal human being. Christ, I think deep down I hate myself too.

I really just don't know what to do. I've gone through the good ol' opiate withdrawals before, and I hate. My clonazepam doesn't do anything for the anxiety, benadryl doesn't stop my nose from running like a popped hydrant, the being hot and cold all at once drives me crazy. Quite honestly, I'd rather die then go through that again. I just, I just really don't know what to do.

I need these meds, but I don't want them. I feel trapped. Christ, should I just end it? My wife could be with someone that is more ""normal"" than I am. She wouldn't have to deal with my constant hospitalizations for my medical condition. My family wouldn't have to worry anymore. I just... I don't know anymore. I'm 27, and so much has been taken away from me. I was supposed to go to graduate school, but my fucking condition took that away from me. I spent three months straight in a hospital which caused me to lose my job. I'm now just a substitute teacher and get SSDI. I'm 27 and lost my career and depend on the government because I can't go a month without being in the hospital.

I realize this is just me bitching, and I don't know what I'm expecting from you all. You just seem like decent people, for the most part, that understand dependence/addiction.

What I didn't anticipate however is the slow pace of royal mail at this time of year. I woke up this morning sick as fuck and had to call in to work which I hate doing especially when it's self inflicted. All good though cos the postman comes by at 11 and I'll have my medicine and be feeling fine by lunch. Wrong. The postman didn't bring me my daily struggle powder so my sickness was set to get worse.

I was already off work so decided to go into town and see if I can find some there. Got speaking to this rough looking lady that was begging on the high street who turned out to be a lovely person and agreed to help me score if I bought her a bag. Perfect. So I drive her to the spot and she asks for the cash which I was kind of worried about but I'd drove half a mile out of town and I had all her stuff in the car so I gave it to her and told her to hurry up. 10 minutes later and she appears with 2 wraps of heroin. One for me and one for her. She then asks me if I can take her to buy some ""dope"". That's what we call hash here in Scotland. So I do and she kindly breaks me off a chunk about 2 grams. Happy days.

So I drive her home and give her my number so she can hit me up if there's more heroin around. I get home and unwrap my haul which if I'm honest looks a bit light. It was supposed to be a half gram for 20 quid but what I've got looks more like the 10er bags I used to get in Glasgow which are .25. Oh well at least I'm not sick and I now have that connection to the local heroin scene in the shitty little town I live in. Oh and all this only took 3 hours which isn't bad considering I had lunch and looked around shops for Xmas presents in that time.

Over the course of the first week I was there they did a medically assisted detox regimen with Suboxone that made kicking dope the absolute easiest it has ever been. After my final dose I literally only had one night where I had some relatively minor RLS that kept me up off and on. 

I unfortunately do not remember the dosing schedule, but I know that the dowses started somewhat high around 8mg and for the first day or two I literally got woke up every 4 hours to redose. From there the doses went down rapidly along with the time in between doses increasing rapidly. 

Does anyone know this dosing schedule, or something similar that would essentially do the same? I have been on another run with your friendly street Heroin/Fent combo as well as some Opana sprinkled in. For the last two days I have made myself take Opana as it is so damn hard to induce oneself onto subs coming off of the Fent Dope. It seems like no matter how long you wait you run a high chance of PWD as I have unfortunately put myself there a few times even after waiting as long as 48 hours. When my only DOC was Opana it was very reliable that if I waited 24 hours I could get on subs no problem. 

Anyway, I have around 30 subs so I have plenty more than I need to do this. I get insurance on January 1st and rather than dancing with the subs as I have done many times and failed, I want to get on the Vivitrol shot. The 3 months I was on it were the cleanest and best 3 months of my life over the past decade. I’m unfortunately one of those people that can’t handle taking subs as maintenance because I plan relapses every month based on my visit to the doc and subsequent drug test. It’s always the same too...it starts with using a day or two a month then back to subs and then before I know it I end up using so much of the month that I have to delay appointments, etc to be able to piss clean. 

My life is crumbling and I am losing my wife in the process. We have been together for 18 years and she is the only woman that I have ever truly loved and I don’t think I would ever love anyone the way I love her if I were to lose her. 

TLDR: Life is crumbling. I need help finding out the dosing schedule rehabs use for the week long sub detox. Google has been fruitless so far. 

Edit: I just want to say a big THANK YOU to the numerous people who have offered insight into this post. I have lurked this sub for years, and even posted under another account I use on numerous occasions, and I have to say that this community truly has some of the very best people. We may be junkies for the most part, but rotten people that does not make us. Any time I have ever seen someone seeking help or advice on this sub it is always welcomed with the warmest of arms.

WHAT SHOULD I TRY FIRST?! 

I’ll have test strips, blah blah blah alladat

The pills were 40mg each and were surprisingly easy to break/cut in half. I started doing ~10mg to begin with (ate a sandwich beforehand) and I felt really good. I was a little bit disappointed because I didn't feel as good as I hoped for, which prompted me to take 2/4 i.e. ~20mg more. Then I had a blast. Aftera while, I decided to take the 10mg that was left for a total of 40mg. I felt amazing, but ~~I didn't experience any issues you might expect~~. <- Nope, I totally forgot how incredibly itchy I was all over my body. It felt great to scratch myself. Is it possible to have some sort of natural tolerance for certain classes of drugs? First time I did xanax, I took 4mg and couldn't feel a thing and those pills were straight from the pharmacy just like these oxycodone are (Sandoz). Also, I didn't really nod off. Not much anyway. I read that oxy is a more stimulating opioid compared to others, so that might be why I didn't really nod off. 

But yeah, overall a great experience **EXCEPT** for at the end where I got nauseas as all hell and had to puke a few times. I'm still nauseas now, the morning after, and I'm just chilling in bed. Thanks for the help everyone.",1545215690.0

I use, my girlfriend uses. We go through roughly 6 grams of high quality tar in about 3 days... Back about 10 years ago when I first dabbled in opiates with norco 10s and tussionex which were my first drugs of choice..... when my cousin was fired from his job at the pharmacy he was working at for suspicion of his stealing pills (and syrup) I inducted on sub easily. I remember it giving me a good buzz that lasted and lasted. No such luck anymore.I have had a couple of half ass attempts at getting on sub since being on tar. Every time I'll stop until I'm pretty fucking sick, at least 18 hrs, and I'll take the sub and it wont seem to have much of any effect at all (maybe a SLIGHT improvement), and because of my ability to just go get more dope, I'm trying to make the transition as absolutely painless as possible. I've acquired fifty .2mg clonidine, my friend gave me like 10 100mg gabapentin, which I will try and get more from him.... but I was going to try the bernese method of microdosing but I want people with 1st person experience to give thier thoughts on it, not someone regurgitating what they read on a forum. 

On a similar note, I'm planning on having a 2 or 3 day bender of getting super high, I dont know about anyone else. But even with really good dope i have to do so much to get a good nod it almost wont even fit in my rig. Any GOOD potentiators, what about clonidine for potentiating? I miss the days when I could have mini dreams, when my girlfriend would know I was on opiates because I would nod out uncontrollably and start talking about some nonsense because I was having a dream while being literally awake (with a definite dulled consciousness). Those seem to be few and far between. I'll give a dub of my shit to someone who does a half gran a day and they almost fall out, I shoot .35 or .4 and feel a slight sense of well being at most. And then because its tar, I have become practically a phlebotomist hitting capillary sized veins for a while, and the shits just a fucking hassle and not worth it. Wanted to enjoy a final hoorah though. 

Getting on the subs is going to be hell, especially since I gotta drag my girlfriend on the sub train with me or else we both will stay on dope, and shes not exactly the easiest to deal with and still just hasn't had that sobering realization that being able to have the shit that we've come accustom to in a pretentious suburb wont come while pissing thousands away on dope. Before I had so much access to dope, when I would score a gram and feel like it was alot, when I had 1 plug and was fucked if she decided to not answer my call... I remember thinking that I would be somehow content if I just never had to worry about getting sick, but even with huge stashes, comes a different kind of depression.  Who can relate?

Fentanyl isn’t in legit prescription medication from the pharmacy, we do know that...so it’s frustrating that prescription medication is being so strictly regulated by the DEA and hurting those of us in pain.  

What’s even MORE frustrating is work who sent me the email...is the government!!  So I know they know...and they know I know they know.

They offer a space of at least a couple hours of pure bliss with no pain as well as relief from the constant cyclical anxiety surrounding when I will be in pain. 

Thing is, I can't bring an x ray to a doctor and say here, look, I'm hurting. They literally have to take my word for it and everyone so far has been too skeptical to even lift a finger for pain meds. On top of everyone tightening down their pain med prescriptions, opiates are one of the last things perscribed for headaches aka they never prescribe them. 

So until I exhaust every other avenue which could take years, I have no chance of even coming close to a prescription for opiates. I'm almost to the point where I wanna cry back pain because I would have a way better chance. Opiates help me with the intense bouts of cluster headaches, they help stop me from feeling that the world is ending and I'm gonna die. They also lessen migraine pain to a manageable level so I can function during the day. 

Lately, I've been smoking tar once a week or twice a week depending on how bad my cluster headaches are. It helps a shit ton and it sucks I have to resort to black tar because I would much rather have a pharmaceutical fix instead of something off the street. My parents don't understand this and they never will. I don't even try to bother explaining this to them. I'm just frustrated because it seems like no matter what going forward I'm fucked. Either I slip back into opiates every week because of my pain or I suffer and kill myself even faster on random meds they throw at me that are supposed to help.

If anyone could say a kind word or a word of encouragement, I would love to hear it right now. I'm all fucked up in my head because I feel like I'm being a bad person trying to remedy my pain on my own. In gonna be smoking some tar tonight, so cheers everyone.

A long time ago, I was not a functioning heroin addict. My whole life was about getting high, I couldn't be bothered with going to school or work, I did some pretty degrading things once or twice to get money for dope. I ended up in rehab and I was told there's no such thing as a ""functioning addict"". We choose using over everything else if we even use once.

Obviously I didn't stay clean. But since I relapsed, I finished undergrad. I've had the same job for over two years now. I make pretty decent money, and I've gotten a very generous raise because I perform well. My bills are always paid. Sometimes, I dance at an adult club when I need extra money for my habit, but I never dance because my bills need paid. Yes, a lot of this has to do with the trust I've built up with my dealer. Because I never go sick, I don't miss work; therefore I can still hold my job. My dealer is very reliable, very close by, and will front me any amount when I don't have the money because I always pay him immediately. I am aware that without him, I probably wouldn't be as functioning.

But one of the things that gets to me is how my family tells me they're so proud of me for ""staying clean"" and how well my life is going. I wish I could tell them, I have been getting high this entire time and my life is still going well. So why is it so bad?

I don't know... does anyone else feel/live like this? Does anyone here believe in being a ""functioning addict""? I just find myself wondering so often, things are fine, so why is getting high such an awful terrible thing of me to do?

&#x200B;

edit: I know that I would not be functioning without my connect because I would get sick. I know that things could go bad real quick if I got in legal trouble. Mostly, I just feel so frustrated when people in my life tell me how ""good I'm doing now"" when I know I just got high, and have been getting high the whole time. I guess I just needed to vent about that. Thanks, everyone, for the support <3",1545185678.0

I lost my wife might lose my car that’s $70,000 pawned all my expensive gold for blues.. and spent like $100,000 this year and stopped working too and live with my parents. I’ve reached a point where I do it just because I don’t feel pain and things feel “normal” now on oxy not euphoric. Since I do it like 2-3 times a week becoming less now that I have no money and steal or find shady ways or lie to get blues... Including for example being so pathetic and miserable as to put enough gas to Reach my plug 30 miles away most of the time in traffic which can take like an hour and a half and then another hour and half back, except once I reach there I pretty much run out of gas so I go to thr gas station and say I lost my wallet and ask the employee or customers to hook me up with gas. And people are so cheap too nowadays. Everytime anyone has wanted money at the gas station I've helped them. Even let a guy pump $25 gas because I'm not cheap or selfish and don't feel like ""omg I'm gonna lose everything and ima be a loser if I give my money to someone"" and don't have panic and heart attacks and anxiety like others.. And always help yet when I ask people are so hesitant and close to dying from anxiety and heart attack when they help and barely give a dollar. Females are even worse giving only coins and shit.

Why are people so selfish and heartless like this?

Anyway back in topic. Anyone have asmr or get rushes when listening to music they like or get emotional. On opiates the rush is nonexistent and gone. When I'm off opiates I feel the rushes come back. At first when I used to be clean I loved it but now they sort of give nerve pain indicating I most likely have damaged my veins through iv oxy.

Anyone else have this? Anyone else realize or get asmr or thr goosebumps/rush sensation while on opiates? 

Also I hope my lack of desire for wanting blues is permanent. Even now when I dream of getting oxy or somehow get money I don't even feel like getting more.

Guys pray for me to make money and not get blues. I will ask my mother or my wife to keep it.

I was researching some drugs today to see how I wanted to to next try and deal with my post-opiate user depression. I came across some stuff that lead me to look at the list of scheduled substances. At the bottom of the list there was a section I hadn't seen before called ""Temporary/Emergency listings"". Which is basically the DEA/FDA's way of going around the process of scheduling a molecular structure before actually putting it through the rigorous paces of evaluation and scientific determination before classification. You know, like how weed is a schedule I narcotic for some reason.

&#x200B;

OK. if thats not bad enough that they can put something on the list for 2-3 years while they make a determination, it gets way worse. I was reading down the temporary list which is full of synthetic marijuana compounds and fent analog compounds. BUT, at the very bottom, the newest entry simply says ""Fentanyl-related substances"". No molecular structure, nothing. Heres the list: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_Schedule\_I\_drugs\_(US)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Schedule_I_drugs_(US))

&#x200B;

I thought that can't be legal, they can't just schedule a compound if they don't know what it is, or if it even exists. So I cracked my knuckles, poured a coffee, popped an adderall, lit a cig, and decided I'm getting to the bottom of this! That was 2-3 hours ago.

&#x200B;

Turns out, they can. They just had to do a shitload of legal gymnastics to pull it off, and I'm pretty sure you would have a really good court case if you wanted to fight this one. I'll try to go through their relative points:

Earlier this year the DOJ and DEA released a proclamation stating that they are putting any/all ""fentanyl related substances"" on the Schedule I temporary list for 2 years with the option to make it 3 while laws might be enacted.

The proclamation is not an actual law, they are citing a 1984 amendment made to the Controlled Substances Act of 1970.

Here's where the gymnastics begin. under this 1984 amendment the AG can issue an ""order"" scheduling a substance for a period of 1 years and add 6 months if they are still processing it, then they amended that amendment in 2012 and doubled their time frame. The substance for the temp ban cannot be already scheduled. If it is scheduled than it remains as scheduled. Thats how the Controlled Substances law reads.

Under this new ""order"" all ""fentanyl related substances"" are now a schedule I narcotic. They describe a ""fentanyl related substance"" as anything structurally related to the chemical compound. So basically they are saying that even though it hasn't even been dreamed up, it's illegal. This is a huge departure from anything previous that I'm aware. I can sorta understand circumventing the law by creating a temporary ban on a specific chemical/molecular structure. Even that is a bridge too far though, they went crazy and just said if it can vaguely resemble fentanyl than its illegal and we don't even need to know how or if it can help/harm anyone, or get them high. Or even be a controlled substance for that matter. You can't call something a controlled substance if you don't know what that substance is. It could be an inert pesticide that shares fentanyl's structure.

They spend a lot of time justifying this by parsing words. Since this proclamation is not a ""rule"" but is a ""temporary scheduling order"" from the AG, then it not subject to any sort of oversight, or judicial/congressional review or intervention. They basically use fear mongering to circumvent protocol. They say they don't have to follow the Congressional Review Act, or the Administrative Procedure Act, and a few other parties that should be involved because if they don't act now WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE (or something, I dunno). They also reassure everyone that if they did have to follow the law it's no biggie because they would agree, there's  just no time to let anyone see what the AG is up to. 5 paragraphs stating why they don't have to follow protocol and they finish it by saying ""as stated above, this is an order, not a rule"". If they were making a new rule, then they would have to actually let the people know.

&#x200B;

So it's like this. Fentanyl it'self is a schedule II narcotic. That won't change because they can't piss off big pharma. They know that most of the fent prescribed is abused. Even though fent is schedule II, any drug that remotely shares it's molecular structure is so dangerous it goes straight to schedule I even if it's not even been thought of yet. It's like saying that Jack Daniels is totally fine to drink, but anything related to JD like say, Jim Beam will kill you, don't ask any questions...

Whenever a new chemical is invented there is a process involved that will determine it's worth to civilization. Until that process is finished, a chemical isn't anything in the eyes of the law. It's simply a chemical, that is how we create things like cures for disease or that fancy new Flex Seal you just ordered. That's how we have always operated. This move is a pretty crazy Patriot Act-ish departure from that.

&#x200B;

From a different point of view it looks great. Law enforcement gets more money, prison shareholders get richer, pharma gets to keep it's lockdown on fent (which is a shitty pain killer, does more harm than good IMHO). The general public won't say anything about how the DOJ/FDA/AG just completely broke the law. Because they are protecting us. Now the slippery slope can get more slippery. Meanwhile, the streets will still be full of bad laced up dope, we will still attend funerals of people that unknowingly bought fent, and nothing will change, even though they say this is all to fix a national crisis; they just cant be bogged down with laws and procedures right now. Fent will still be everywhere, overdoses will continue to rise, and shit won't change at all.

&#x200B;

Here's the official document, it's a pretty crazy read. [https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr/21usc/811.htm](https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr/21usc/811.htm)

And here is the Controlled Substances Act: [https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr/21usc/811.htm](https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr/21usc/811.htm)

&#x200B;

I've been pretty much squeaky clean for about a year, the last time I got a bag I unknowingly got fent, and I woke in the hospital a day later with the nurse telling me how lucky I am that the 3rd shot of Narcan finally worked also that someone seen me slumped over my steering wheel in a parking lot. But this shit they are doing isn't going to change anything. It's just using fear mongering like always.

I just was told if I don’t get surgery then they do not want to prescribe me the medication any longer and that I need to go to another pain management clinic because they feel I’m too young and it’s not healthy. I’m in my early 20s and was wondering if I’ll have any trouble going to another PM clinic to get my scripts filled. I have documentation and 3 MRIs from this year that all are the same after getting multiple injections and going to PT. Nothing has really made a difference in the pain that lasts, and I really am not ever comfortable unless I am taking Percocet. I guess what I’m asking for is if anybody with experience in PM thinks that I should have any issue getting prescribed at another doctor. I have herniated discs and one of them is on my nerves, and is over 10mm, all of the doctors I have seen have said it’s a lot worse than the regular herniation. I’m not too worried I just wanted that extra blanket of confidence seeing as I just picked up my script and it’s cut in half. Thank you for this subreddit and everyone in it, it makes being in pain and on pain meds a lot more relatable. 

Edit: I was told that people in my position will be in the same place in 2 years regardless if they get the surgery or not. And if I get the surgery it will make everything weaker in that area and only give me further issues. It’s just a quick fix to an issue that isn’t most likely going to go away.

My personal journey began with a 24 hour-ish period of psychosis that began with the worst panic attack of my life. I received an overwhelming amount of support, like usual, from this community of beautiful people. I just wanted to let all those people that reached out know that I am on day two of intensive outpatient therapy. Honestly, I wish I had come here sooner. The staff and even the other addicts are amazing and make me feel safe and ready to tackle this demon. My doctor had me on 8 mg of suboxone but we decided today that I am going to attempt to kick them cold turkey. I have 3 weeks off for this treatment so I want to take advantage of this opportunity and get everything out of my system. I don’t want to leave the comfort of this facility and still have to kick suboxone alone. Last time I kicked suboxone alone, I started this run that I am on almost a year ago. Withdrawals were so much worse than heroin that i ended up even deeper in my use than I was prior to maintenance. If I get into my detox process and it’s too much to handle while driving an hour each way for treatment and a relapse becomes an option, I still have subs left to fall back on. I could fail and end up back on subs, but I have to give it a shot and try to make the best of my opportunity. Just wanted to say thank you again from the bottom of my heart to all those that reached out to me with words of encouragement and advice. We all know how deeply this disease can dig it’s claws in and how lonely it can be when using and when trying to get clean. I have isolated for so long that I don’t have friends, so having this sub as a place to come with problems has saved my life.

I’m up to about 100 mg of either Hydro or Oxy every day 40 will keep me well and 60 to last throughout the day I usually don’t have a choice with that I’m getting because it’s all that I can find. It’s been like this for a couple months with about 6-8 months total in active addiction. I did subs in the middle of these 6 months for about 2 and it was great I was saving money my relationship got better my job ethic got better everything go better until the subs stopped doing it’s magic. Now I’m at the point I can’t even pay for what I get everyday I’m paying off the front I got the day before. Well now to the point of this whole thing, my plug sparked up a conversation with me today and asked why I get dope sick so fast. I was confused and told him that its probably because I take some much. Well he takes wayyy more than I do and he says he doesn’t start feeling sick until THREE OR FOUR DAYS AFTER HIS LAST DOSE. I feel sick literally since the second I wake up. It’s not THAT bad if I dose right before going to bed but if I did in the morning the next morning its TERRIBLE and just gets worse from there. So I guess my question is is this normal?? Is my plug just a freak of nature or bullshitting me? Or am I the freak of nature? Hoping some insight from you experienced guys help me to answer.

I just made myself quite a lot of codeine, and took some 3 days prior.

Almost at all.

Now, i thought that i might have a tolerance, but i've been using consistently for 1 year already. And usually these amounts are enough to get me really high with a histamine reaction. I thought that it might be just my tolerance suddenly sky rocketing, but i DIDN'T HAVE ANY HISTAMINE REACTION EITHER.

So, could it be that i botched the CWE by letting the codeine stay a bit too long, or leaving it filtering during the night, or fiters breaking, me needing to refilter, lukewarm water destroying the codeine?

&#x200B;

I have a question regarding fentanyl patches. I am prescribed 25 mircograms/hour. I get the standard 2 boxes so 20 in total. For some reason, even with Tagederm, I've lost a few patches this month. I'm worried that I won't be able to make it until my next refill. I was just wondering if the patches last longer than the 72 hours.I know I'm not your regular user, but I was still hoping that you'd all be able to help me. I, personally, think it's stupid that there is such tight regulation on this stuff, but that is neither here nor there. Like I said, any help or advice would be much appreciated.

&#x200B;

Just a quick EDIT: I don't abuse my patches. With this whole ""opiod epidemic"", which I think is the new Reefer Madness, I'm very careful with how I use them. I was prescribed the patch because I had a little bout with cancer not so long ago. I've been through withdrawals before, and I don't really care to experience that again.

Said he was giving me the same price he was getting it for that’s why he asked for some for doing it. Knew this was bullshit but the stuff was worth the price. Stopped fucking with him when I moved into my new apartment mainly because his connect lives in the same complex. So I wasn’t about to drive an hour to pick him up come back into the city then bring him back home then come back here just to get shit threw my neighbor. Today I was waiting on someone else in my parking lot and I saw his dude walking by to meet someone else so I waved him over and he was like “you good, what are you doin?” So I asked if he fucked with mike and he said nah why? I said “ imma be straight up with you. I’m trying to get the plug so I don’t gotta go threw someone else. I live right there” he ended up telling me to meet him in my back lot after getting my shit and I did. He came into my apartment handed me a bundle and told me we would be good if I did some in front of him. So I did. Found out it’s actually only fourty a bun and got his number.

a7cu7k,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/a7cu7k/no_memory_of_yesterday/,14,https://redd.it/a7cu7k,NotPoliticalyCorrect,No memory of yesterday !!,"So yesterday morning I got up and my friend phoned and asked if I wanted to go score with him again and if I wanted to get some valium (fake presses) 20 for £10 . So since I've not had them in a good while I though why the fuck not ! Even though they make me go nuts ! So we go into town and meet his guy I get a half gram and 20 valium and he gets a teenth and 20 as well every thing is in the one bag so I give him his teenth and count out the valium I get to 15 and he says to keep the rest as that's all he needs as he's a light weight with them as well.
 I chew up 5 as we are walking for the bus so once I'm home they will be hitting me . The bus isn't for another 20 minutes so my friend decided to call a taxi and within 4/5 minutes we are heading home. We day cheerio and I walk down to mine . I inject and he smokes so didn't want to do it in his . He tells me to pop round later for a coffee if I'm not to mad with it . 

   Get in the house and I half my half gram on a DVD case and put the other half away and put the rest on a spoon. I count out the rest of the valium and decide to take another 4 so 9 altogether . I go down stairs and offer my mum some as she's sometime prescribed the for insomnia but only 2 mg ones she takes then and I head back up stairs . By this time I'm starting to feel all that Mr Soft kinda way and pop another one to make it an even 10 lol I cook up my charge and get a huge rush and boom ! That's it ! I wake up at 8am the next morning with zero memory !!! Not a thing ! Nothing ! Everything is completely gone not even like an alcohol black out where you remember bits an bobs this is a total void !! My mum says I was totally away with the fairies talking to myself , couldn't speak properly or pronounce words correctly etc . She said I went out 4 times but fuck knows where as she took my money and bus card .

    I cooked up the other hit and was walking about the house with the syringe and when my mum went of her nut I apparently waved/stuck  it in her face and told her it was fine as it was 100% ORGANIC !!! and 100% CHLORIC ACID !!! She's a nurse and knows exactly what heroin is and I first got caught using at 16 so she's known I use for many years . This right here is why I rarely take valium !!! She also said I changed my clothes about 8 times and was convinced I was going into town .

  When i woke up my room was an absolute mess sin bins (syringe boxes) where broken open and syringes where every where. It seemed like I had just nodded off but something like 15 hours had passed ! I couldn't find anything wallet ,money ,phone ,iPad etc and my mum was extremely pissed ! Lol telling me I was getting chucked out . Then telling me all the retarded things I was doing . I found my phone and prayed I hadn't contacted anyone while out my nut but thankfully I hadn't . .y mum had to take my gran to hospital today and she left but didn't tell me she had my wallet,bus pass or money . So I had to phone her and ask when she'd be back as I couldn't find them and she told me they where behind the large fish tank . So I headed off into town to get a couple of bags and new tools(syringes) and did one in my dealers place the valium must have still been in my system as I nodded out really hard and was basically eating kitchen floor ! They thought I was oding ! But explained to them it was the valium from yesterday plus I woke up straight away when Rab shouted on me . 

  So yeah last time I'm taking those fucking crazy pills for a good while !! Certainly not 25 of the bloody things !! Though I'll still be taking my 100% organic heroin !!! PMSL what the fuck was I thinking !!!

He’s an old plug who I know through my ex from when I lived here, but I ended up meeting up with my ex boyfriend later anyway, and was delighted at his suggestion that we cop for old times’ sake. However, Mr. Massage was still MIA, and after trying a few less reliable connects, ex boyfriend decided to attempt a cold cop.

I am extremely clean cut, so he did all the talking, so as not to scare away any potentials, but once they realized I was with him, they didn’t mind me waiting in the car. 

Corner man called his guy and the guy okayed my dude to go in the house, and he came out with a baggy of pure white power. So white i thought it was coke, but ex taste tested for me and said definitely not coke.

So we get back to the fancy hotel my work puts me in and we make some lines and go to town, but very slowly, as were the instructions of the seller. I was extremely leery of fentanyl, since I had never seen stuff look like this. We both got pretty good and high pretty quick, but ex, who’s DOC is coke, continued going at it despite my begging him to slow down. He starts accusing me of being a hype and trying to keep it all to myself, which is so far from the truth, and next thing I know he’s collapsed in the bathroom and his eyes won’t focus and he can barely utter more than some grunts. Oh my gawd am I really about to be dealing with an OD?!?

So I can’t have this incident linked to my employer, so as selfish as it sounds, I’m running around grabbing all of his essentials, and I manage to get him up and walking, but barely. I get him out of the hotel, all 200 lbs of him slumped over my little shoulders, and I sit him down in front of the candy store next to the hotel. I try a few more times to get him awake and with me because I really wanted to avoid the call, at that point more for his sake than mine...but no luck. Fuck. So he’s always been a selfish, manipulative ass, so before you think I sound too cold hearted, just keep in mind that his idiot lack of control wasn’t worth risking my career over...So I walk down the street and watch from afar as people start to ogle him and I make the 911 call. I watch from the corner as the ambulance pulls up with the cop car, and they put him on the stretcher, at which point I walk back in the hotel. I watched from the window as the ambulance sat there for 10 minutes, and all I could see was movement through it’s back window. And as the ambulance drives off, he tries to call me. I didn’t answer. 

He calls again 20 minutes later from the hospital, and this time I answer, and he’s perfectly coherent asking “did you really call the cops on me?” I tell him that he overdosed and it’s clear that they narcaned him because the man I saw 30 minutes prior was definitely on his way out and couldn’t speak, let alone dial a phone. He won’t shut up about me calling the cops on him because I was “so desperate to get rid of him so I could have all the shit to myself.” I say: “oh, you mean the shit I flushed down the toilet 20 minutes ago?!” Because that’s what i did. I continue to avoid his calls after that, but answered again at one point to say “you’re welcome for saving your life because right now i wish I hadn’t”

Go figure, oil massage dboy comes back on the grid moments before this happens, so I passed off exbfs construction clothes to him, thinking i would have to leave before he got released from the hospital, but they didn’t keep him very long, so of course he’s mad about that too.

Relapsed after having a miscarriage with my girlfriend and started shooting heroin again, taking pills and drinking but recently started to get clean again.   
I absolutely can't stand AA and NA, with the religion and stuff and people on here mentioned the SMART meetings so i looked it up and there is some in my city so I'm going to be attending my first smart meeting tomorrow night.  


How does the SMART meetings differ from traditional AA or NA? Has anyone had success with it over NA? I always enjoyed going to meetings and listening to people and reflecting on why i am there in the first place but could not get into the higher power stuff and to work the 12 steps you need to accept the higher power which i just can not do. Im not much of a talker in the meetings so I'm hoping these smart meetings will help me get back on track to living a sober life again.  


Any advice/tips or just general information on these meetings would be great. Thanks everyone who decides to reply to this!",1545148194.0

I'm looking in to pain management and opiates to control what are extremely painful urinary tract infections. I've got a lot of surgical and medical history and it's a whole spiel, I've posted about it before, but it's besides the point of this question.

One of the ""side effects"" (rather euphoric properties) that I like about opiates is the almost tingling numbness that they provide your body. How your muscles feel extremely comfortable and just like you weigh a million pounds and sink very lovingly into your bed. 

I don't want to use whatever opiates I may be prescribed for that purpose. One, it'd be an increased risk of addiction and even though I'm fairly certain I don't have a huge addictive potential, I don't want to take the risk, two it adds to my tolerance REALLY quickly, and three, perhaps most simply, I'll fuckin' run out lmao. 

What alternatives provide this sort of sensation and calming effect to the body? I have restless legs and I'm considering seeing a neurologist or my pcp to see if I have some peripheral neuropathy from my kidney failure because I am constantly uncomfortable or in some degree of minor pain.

Anyone else feel this way?","I'm having to find another job, and mostly all the call backs are from restaurants (fast food, etc). At 29, 6 months away from being 30, it's extremely discouraging having to work around pretty much all high schoolers and the one or two 40-50 some year old managers that seem like they just try and fit in with the high schoolers, rather than being a good AM or manager in general.

So it's either playing cook in a burger joint or waitressing until Ive been there long enough to qualify as a bartender. It's somewhat degrading also, and the way I get looked at by customers or judged out loud (and anyone who's worked in the business knows this happens a lot), it just adds to the depression.

I think about going back to school and getting another degree (I have my B.A in Pharmacology but due to my charge will NEVER be able to work in a pharmacy or not for another 20-30 years) in computer programming, UX, and maybe getting into the whole tech field but I can't afford to earn another degree and have it go nowhere, whether by fault or because no one wants to hire me.

I hate that I'm judged so highly by my background that I'm barely able to compete with people who aren't even half as qualified. I hate having to work at shit jobs and play dumb with everyone because ""if u went to uh.. College then uh.. Why u here then?"" I stress myself out so much and see myself doing so much better eventually that it all feels like a daydream compared to my actual life.

I want to be somebody. I want to be successful so much its all I think about, even when I think I'm getting ahead I'm so much further behind than I actually am. I don't want to be in my old age unable to work or still making minimum wage no matter how much it's raised.

Idk, maybe I'm just in my feelings. But as an addict with charges, theres so much more that defines me and makes me. Unfortunately that's not how the work force sees it. Trying to keep my head up as my next job will probably be waiting tables at Buffalo Wild Wings (I'm serious).

He had an opiate addiction while living here and couldn't keep the addict in him at bay so he searched for a treatment center far away from home.

Very long, very interesting, very fun yay.","Alright so this was back in 2016 a little over 2 years ago.  I was in my last year of undergrad to get my chemical engineering degree.  I made 2 trips a week down to a town close to a border (this was usually a 12 hour round-trip and my running mate and I always went there, picked up, turned around and came right back.  This gave us the time to go to all the classes we needed to, dip out, and arrive back in the early morning hours to get to our 8 a.m.s if we needed to.  Sometimes we just said fuck class (I did, a lot, because I was smart and most of my classes I really didn't need to go to unless I wasn't understanding the material, so I would teach myself in-between times of inebriation and times of sickness).  We usually picked up 1-5 pieces (if you don't know what a piece is, it's 25gs aka a mexican oz), if we picked up 5 we would usually only do just that one trip for that week because, well we simply still had product left.

We as a duo sold to a select group of people, anywhere from 5-10 on any given week.  We were wholesalers, so we never sold to your typical user, although some of the people we dealt with used.  I never went in too deep with what these people were doing but I always asked them, ""do you use?"" - it's important to know who the users are or not, you've always got to be on your toes with these ones and never drop your guard.  Also if they told me know and there were signs that they used I just assumed, so pretty much I just assumed everyone used, can't be too careful.  Now my buddy usually kept half the product at his place and I kept half at mine.  He lived alone whilst I lived with my brother, we did this incase something happened to either spot, the *meetings* were also done at his place.  I was a very high functioning addict, my brother never knew about anything (we lived together for 3 years and were close) until events I will go into later flip the light switch on to the world.  Business was booming, prices literally 7xd once we made our trek back up into our college town.  Both my buddy and I used, I quietly fucked with the needle on the side while I smoked it in front of him (didn't want him knowing I used the needle, as he had used such pretentious slander towards those who did).  It may not have ruined our friendship, probably not since it was my connect.  Every weekend was a god damn party, as you can assume we lived in a pretty big college town, so we would flaunt our shit etc etc...

Now that was just a little backstory as to where I was at with my life at that point and what all was going on.

Everything was going good until a mutual friend of my running mate and I decided to come visit us and hang for the weekend.  He brought some fentanyl with him, which I was cool with because I was knowingly doing a substance, I just took it easy smoking little bit by bit.

Next thing I know I hear something loud like a fall out on the balcony area.  I lift my nodding ass forehead off the ottoman and go outside to find our mutual friend, let's call him T, seizing on the ground foaming at the mouth.  His pulse was gone by the time I could even reach his jugular vein, blood was seeping out of his ears - he was gone but I could take that answer.  I live right by a hospital so I thought I could get him there quicker than an ambulance coming, also the fact we had lots of drugs, cash, weapons etc at the place.  T was D.O.A combination of the OD causing him to fall and cause blunt force trauma to his head by hitting concrete.  So....one of my best friends dies of an OD, what do I do?

Next day (was Monday at 3pm) I go to the bar, immediately order 4 pickle backs and a beer, slam it, order 4 more, and slammed it again.  Bartender tells me I should probably slow down, I then said , ""fuck that I need to forget about some shit for today, then I'll worry about what I do tomorrow."" (Quoted in police report, now I probably said something like that, but who knows I said a lot of shit that afternoon at the bar).  Bartender didn't notice my intoxication and kept feeding me what I ordered.  I ended up having 13 shots and 8 beers on my tab in a span of 2 hours (now I know I forsure bought 2 girls shots, so I don't think I drank all of that, but I was in fuck you reckless mode, and at this point I'm fucking toasted).

I pay and this is where shit starts to get very blackout-ish.  I live about half a block from the bar and I had walked there and politely (yeah politely) declined a taxi service to come get me and deliver me to a daycare service to be looked after.  Now me being a jackass drunk I was stumbling in the middle of the road at 5 pm on a Monday evening when a guy in a truck rolls down his window and says ,""hey asshole get the fuck out of the road you drunk dumbass"", or something similar to that.  At this point I'm almost back to my place, turns out this fucker lives at the same complex as me. Now I ain't no Bitch.

I saw him park in his driveway and I start running like a drunk idiot to confront this guy for just speaking the truth.  Yea I shouldn't have been walking in the middle of the road, but fuck you I'm DRUNK you DICK!  I bang on his window, he gets out, we exchange some vulgarity (this dude was probably mid/late thirties and easily had 40 pounds on me), then words turn into a scuffle.  I'm now going to town on this motherfucker, then he yells to his wife to call the police and go grab his gun.  Now drunk me knows this means bail, my brain should comprehend, and it does, so I get off of him and retreat back to my place. 

Now this is where shit begins to get iffy/sticky/indisputable.  I'm in full black out mode now, like gone GONE.  He alleges that I came back to his place after walking away knowing he had a gun, not only that, but says I came back with a knife.  Now drunk me didn't think that bringing a knife to a gunfight would be a bad idea? (I would hope to think my brain would know not to do this, and I fully believe this guy took advantage of my inebriation and knew I wouldn't be able to back up a story with only his girl as a witness).

He says I had a pocket knife, which I always carry, so I wouldn't have walked to my house to grab it I knew I had it, so this guy fabricated shit to not get into any trouble because the only witness was his gf/fiancé/wife and I was to black out to remember anything.

After this is all alleged although I have settled in court so ? Yea lol

He says I threatened him with my pocket knife and stated that if I started moving towards him he would shoot me...well BANG got a .45 hollow-point slug to the abdomen from 5-6ft away. Drop to my knees, try to get up...stumble....more stumbling...final drop, white lights everywhere (now I think these are from the operating room, if you've ever been in one there's all stainless steel shit and bright lights so I think it was that as I don't believe in god, but something did save me, doctors are my higher being).

Since he had already called the cops they were already on there way so literally an ambulance was there a few minutes after I dropped.  Blood was draining out of my body so fast, taken to the UMC trauma center level 1 (university medical center, the highest level of trauma there is in the US it may be 3, or 1, I want to say 3 but I don't want to look it up so it had the best trauma surgeons in the region) in critical condition (not good). 

My BAC was .281 (pretty high to be that functional, but I guess not) so the first surgery lasted about 8 hours and they kept my chest open for like 10 days, the pain was unFUCKINGbearable.  Nothing helped, Alternating IV fentanyl 100 mcg every 2 hours and IV 4mg dilaudid every 2 hours, so every hour I was getting something.  Now I told them that I was an addict and that shit wasn't doing anything, so they crushed up an unknown mg amount of methadone and pushed it down my NG tube (tube that goes from your nose to your stomach) on top of all the IV shit and still nothing was working.  Next day before going into my 2nd surgery I asked if they could keep me in a medically induced coma for like a week-10 days so I didn't have to go through all this pain and they said only if your conditions lead to it.  Well my body wanted me to go through that pain so I'd be able to handle anything life ever throws my way in the future...and I'm glad my body did that.

Was in the ICU for 10 days then upstairs in the regular ward for another 10 days.  Ruptured bladder (had a catheter (the one up you p-hole) in for 31 days...fucking A man) heavy damage to all of the sections of my intestines (lead to me having a colostomy bag which luckily I got reversed 4 months later).  The bullet went in about an inch below my below button and an inch to the right when looking down at your feet.  It ended up in my left buttock pretty close to the center of my body, which it could've easily hit my spine.  Since it was a hollow-point bullet it sends off a shock wave and the bullet expands to about 2x the regular diameter and does as much damage as possible as they're designed to do, so a lot of shit got fucked up, but I'm lucky nothing too vital was hit like my heart or lungs or liver.  Everything was just bruised/inflamed as fuck except my bladder which was ruptured and my intestines which were torn the eff apart.

I'm bed-bound for the next 3 months and have a nurse coming to my house everyday to change extensive and tricky bandages that only specific nurses can do (we still keep in contact to this day, she's dope as fuck, her name was Shirley haha and she was the sweetest fucking lady).  I left the hospital with shitty pain meds and shitty muscle relaxers and she relayed my messages better than calling to change my meds and she personally prescribed me .5 xanax 4 times a day.  So everyone who was over my care at the hospital knew that I was an addict, but you can't give nothing to someone suffering from GSW (gun shot wound) and multiple surgeries, that's just unethical and could actually get you in trouble.

So everything goes well, I survived...went on to have 4 more surgeries, and just recently (a couple of months ago) I actually had the bullet removed from my ass.  It's crazy as fuck looking at it. Motherfucker is huge, and mean looking. Was clean clean for like 6 months, but couldn't take the pain and went to PM to get a script so I take prescribed meds now with the exception of a couple blues here and there.

Alright let's get on to the legal issues, the state eventually put out an arrest warrant (aggravated assault w/ a deadly weapon - Threat)  after appropriate time for me to heal from surgeries (I was supposed to go in for an arrest and release, which means you just go there and pay bond/bail and leave).  Well I moved back to my hometown with my parents to heal more then had another surgery, and my dad lived in London, UK and me and my mom were going over there to visit him for 2 months and guess what?  I get arrested at the gate before my flight because the goddamn DA did not let my lawyer know he put out the warrant on me which he was supposed to do.  I tell my mom everything is fine I'll answer their questions and I'll get on the next flight out of here (was flying from the US).

Questions lead to them telling me I had a warrant and was going to have to go to jail.  So I spend 2 and a half days in jail (it took them that long to process me before I could bond out) and another fucking thing they set my bond at $100k and it was out of county so you have to pay %15 to bail out.  Well both my parents are in London, but luckily I had money saved up and my brother bailed me out and I paid him back then took oath on it at the bond company so I took liability back, as I had to put up $100k worth of shit incase I didn't show up for court because then they would be liable for that money.

6 months later I had court and plead out with 7 years probation.  Which I guess was kind of a win and kind of a loss.  My lawyer was very old, knew everyone at the court even the elected DA very personally so I truly believe he worked out the best deal for me.  They first came at me with 5 years in jail and 5 years probation so no jail is a win for me.

I now have a little under 6 years of probation left, chronic sciatic nerve pain which I get a hydrocodone script for, PTSD and anxiety which I get xanax, temazepam, and lunesta for. But I'm still here on this earth. Idk why, I truly don't, I should have died man, even the doctors said that (rephrased of course they didn't just tell me you should've lol).  I can't tell you how many times these doctors wouldn't answer my questions about wether or not I'll live or wake up from this surgery...that procedure....fuck man.  It was god damn hell, but now I can handle fucking anything, this withdrawal ain't shit! Fucking it right up the ass lol...but seriously I'm glad I went through that shit.  It made me realize how fucking reckless I was and the terrible mistakes I was making and I needed to change.  Since I gobble down all my scripts so quickly and pick up blues every once in a while I guess I didn't mean much now...hmm

Well that took a while, ask questions if you want I know I left a shit load out, I've got pics of the bullet, my incisions (gory), and a shit load of hospital bands.

TLDR: sold pieces, was in college, got shot, big owwie, bad shitty, alive and sort of thriving now.

Since I need to wait an even longer time in w/ds to switch on buprenorphine from methadone. Would I be able to switch from methadone to codeine if my tolerance is low enough? Then switch from codeine to bupe with no precipitated wds (as i did it before).

I want to switch to codeine because I wouldnt get precipitated wds on a small codeine dose, ex: 60mg when I try to go back to bupe.

a6xxzy,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/a6xxzy/im_on_methadone_today_a_housemate_accidentally/,207,https://redd.it/a6xxzy,ChaoticHood,"I’m on methadone. Today, a housemate “accidentally” hit me with Narcan, thinking that I was OD’ing while taking a nap.","It sounds insane, I know. Turns out that the guy wasn’t all there to begin with, mentally. But after “trying” to wake me from a nap, he thought I must be OD’ing and hit me with Narcan. By trying to wake me, he said he touched my cheek and I didn’t wake up, so he took it upon himself to hit me with the dose. He didn’t tell anyone else in the house, a recovery house full of alcoholics and addicts, what he was doing. He walked by at least 5 people to get the Narcan, we keep it available for emergencies in case of an actual overdose, which we have had happen. But rather than get anyone to help or alert them to what he thought was going on with me, he instead grabbed and administered Narcan. When he then told someone and they woke me up a few minutes later, he then informed them and myself what he had done. 

I’ve been through an overdose and subsequent Narcan dose and the brutal withdrawal that it brings, being a heavy user during my active. The fear gripped me as I knew what was coming. I’m on a methadone maintenance program and haven’t touched dope in 7 months. But I’m on 135mg of methadone daily since getting clean. I felt the tightness in my chest start and knew what comes next. There’s no way to brace for it other than to just pray and know you’re about to be absolutely fucked. Nothing is going to really help with what’s coming. I broke down for a minute and cried, scared, knowing I was about to go through full blown withdrawal again even though I’ve been doing everything I’m supposed to - making meetings, holding down jobs, getting my life back together, doing really really well. 

Ten minutes later I was in full on, violent withdrawal. Since getting clean, I never thought I’d have to experience that again, but thanks to this person’s inexperience and complete disregard, I suffered through it again. And it was just as brutal as I remember. 

Now, I know maybe he thought he was trying to help or doing the right thing. And maybe he was in his own twisted way, but the fact that the next guy was able to wake me just by shaking my leg, and the fact that he didn’t tell a single person what he was about to do was troubling enough, as maybe they would’ve stopped him from just going ahead with it or tried harder to wake me up from my nap. I was literally in bed in my pajamas so I don’t know what made him think it was suspicious in the first place. Like I said, he’s been giving me weird vibes since arriving at the house and I didn’t think he was all together there in his head, but I just minded myself and kept him at arms length. 

Then the worst part and what actually angered me as, I could maybe forgive what he did under the guise of he was trying to save someone he thought was dying, he had the gall to argue with me as I was going in to withdrawal that Narcan doesn’t cause withdrawal or doesn’t get you high, and that I must’ve been using for this to happen. Trying to justify what he had done. Maybe he thought he was going to earn a hip hip hooray and be the hero of the house for “saving” me? Who knows his thought process. I snapped at him about being on maintenance and what was about to happen, what he had put me in to and he continued to shirk the blame, remorseless and completely emotionless. 

I hope it doesn’t make him hesitate in the future when someone actually needs help, but also I hope that he understands that administering something like that without knowing what you’re doing is dangerous. I thought I was going to need hospitalization, but after about 45 minutes of pure agony in the bathroom, I managed to compose myself enough to make it to bed and pass out from exhaustion and sleep through the rest of the ordeal. I woke up about 5 hours later and I feel fine now, but oof, was that a rough ride that I thought I had rid myself of. I can only hope that through the rest of my recovery, no one accidentally Narcans me again during my afternoon nap because I definitely don’t want to do that again, ever. ",1545034448.0

I was given 10 percs (at least I think they were, I did a google search of the code on the pill and drugs.com told me they were 325mg paracetamol and 10mg oxycodone. Pill print was IP204) by some dirty drug dealer. They didn't come in a blister pack or anything, they were given to me in a baggie. I had tried oxycodone 5mg pills before (2 pills, so a 10mg dose) and quite enjoyed my experience. Smooth, calm high, no nausea. I had the warm blanket feeling but no nodding.

I took 1 of these ""percs"" a few nights ago, and about 30 minutes in I noticed intense nausea. Also I could feel the high coming on very fast at this point. At around the hour mark the nausea became so intense that I had to dash to the bathroom to vomit. I didn't even make it in time, I projectile vomited before I reached the toilet bowl. I vomited twice all up, then when I went back to sit at my desk I had zero concentration and a bunch of brain fog, so I lied down.

I eventually fell asleep, but not before some of the most intense nods I've ever experienced. I'm talking mad, fully-blown lucid dreams here. Like nothing I've ever experienced before. I'm not sure if I fell asleep really fast or if I don't remember anything because it fucked my brain so hard, but the night seemed to be over in a heartbeat.

Now I’m not talking about calling because someone looks shady or over little petty shit like an argument, but, say, over something that endangers the safety and well-being of your family or children? 

Edit: I was kinda trying to avoid putting this out there since it’s still an upsetting topic, but I guess perspective is needed.

earlier this week my 21 year old mentally handicapped neighbor was in his front yard and watched my 12 year old daughter getting off the bus and followed her to our door while pulling his pants down and touching himself, she ran into the house and just said “there’s a man outside” so I go to the door and he’s *still there* and ***still*** masturbating. Knowing he’s handicapped I yelled at him to GTFO, locked the door and called the cops. He watched our house from his driveway the entire 45 min it took the cops to get there, then went inside when they got here.  anytime he saw us through the windows while we were waiting he’d come back up onto our porch. 

Of course I called the cops, I have a little girl to protect, but at the same time I don’t want to be responsible for someone else losing their child. Because of my occasional drug use I’ve seen what happens when the cops get called on a young black man, especially the handicapped who may not understand what’s going on. I’ve *seen* families get torn apart when someone gets locked up. 

What I meant when asking if being a user made you reluctant to call is; knowing what it’s like to **be** on the the wrong end of the handcuffs does it make you hesitant to inflict that on someone who’s genuinely a threat, but hasn’t physically caused harm yet? Are you more empathetic because of it?",1545011642.0

Before moving up to Percocet, I had taken 10 mg hydrocodone by qualitest pharma and they seems to be the best of all pharmas out there for 10 mg Hydrocodone (or should I say Norco) in terms of euphoric feelings and pain relief. Qualitest Pharma has yellow pill with V 3601 on them.

So I know that arteries carry blood away from the heart and veins carry it back towards the heart . I also know when you  do a shot and you hit an artery it hurts /burns like a mofo. But my question is that when you do a  shot and you do it in artery will you still get the full effect? Or is it lessened because it has to travel away from heart first and then back . Or does it never even come back to where it needs to go to get you high if you use artery? 

Hopefully that all makes sense. If not sorry and hopefully someone can explain it to me. I've been doing dope for a long time but I'm by no means a biologists. 

Im asking mostly cuz my beings are mostly shot and sometimes I can't hit and no know damn well I'm in an artery and push it in anyway but it seems to not hit me as hard. 

TL;DR..... If I shoot in artery will I still get as high or am I just wasting my shit . Thanks ",1544998343.0

THEY FOUND AND ARRESTED THE ORIGINAL NIGHT STALKER/GOLDEN STATE KILLER. 

That's crazy as fuck. Like 50 years have passed since he was active and how they found him is even crazier. They ran crime scene DNA through a bunch if databases and it popped. But it was his 4th cousin, so they literally (they, as in the feds) looked st this guys (the 4th cousins) family tree and recreated there entire lives times lines and looked for someone in the 4th cousins family who met the profile, AND THRY FUCKING DID. That's so crazy. Like he may be 72 and dying, but shit, he was one that even thr experts figured would never get caught. 


Oh and the same process is being used for the Zodiac Killer right now. 

If they figure out who the Zodiac was, I'll like literally shit myself. Since 1969 only one of his ciphers has ever been cracked. I'm willing to bet, especially with his level and nuance of ciphers, and the age he was when the killings began, probably a ww2 or Korea special forces vet. That's my two cents.  Only thing is, zodiac would be like 100 now, so hes definitely dead, but just to know the true identity of him would he very interesting.

I dosed 6mg bromazepam for some extra buzz. Hardly feeling anything from either morph or bromazepam. I have other meds to potentiate but the stigma of benzos and opiates scare me.

Long version:

I am prescribed 30mg morphine for my restless legs syndrome (codeine, gabapentin, pregabalin and clonazepam didn’t do the trick solely.)

So I usually take 3-6mg’s bromazepam as it is my favorite benzo and is pretty subtle combined with my morphine.

As of now I am feeling nothing from the added bromazepam. I wonder how this is possible since I rarely dose up to 6mg’s (which is a lot for my tolerance). I do have extra bromazepam to maybe potentiate it a bit more.

I also have other benzo’s with me (I always keep klonopin, prazepam, er alpro, nitrazepam) and gabapentins 600’s and pregabalins 25mg to potentiate aswell. My doc is quite aware of my changing painlevels daily, so he allowed me to take whatevers needed.

Would it be smart to just wait on the bromazepam to be fully kicked in or can I add a gab or pregab or another bromazepam to make a difference? Or would that be too cns depressing <> harmful?

I feel a bit stupid for these questions but Im just bummed out I am not feeling relaxed as I used to, especially since I am not a frequent/daily user of bromazepam.",1544984023.0

Oh, and it also erased most of my memory of that).

I've been hospitalized for 3 weeks for full thickness 2nd degree burns, and not once did I get IV opioids. Not when they changed my bandages (daily) and not even when they scraped dead skin off of my arm.

All I got (daily) was 2x10mg oxycontin ER and 2x10mg liquid oral oxycodone IR. For the first couple of weeks that was barely even enough for the background pain, let alone for the procedures. It was about a 10th of the dose I usually take to get high, so obviously it didn't get me high.

Now, 2+ months later, I'm no longer in pain but I still need to change bandages once a week. Possibly for 2 more months. After that I'm not to expose the burn site to sunlight for a year.

I don't know, maybe I'd have gotten better shit in the US, but considering the country I'm in never had an opioid epidemic and yes I *still* didn't get anything worthwhile, I doubt it.

TL;DR: If you hurt yourself to get opioids at the hospital, you'll be lucky to get enough painkillers for the pain you caused yourself, let alone enough to get high.",1544974306.0

I'm tired of it man.  Tired of going to bed and making sure I have enough in my sack to get well in the am and through my job till I get off and can get more. Tired of driving my plug to re-up in the hood and waiting around in my car asking to get pulled over and arrested. Tired of driving to meet up with her only to have her nod out and ghost me for hours till she's back up and then tells me ""oh sorry I sold my last bag can you take me to get more?"" Which in turn is a 5 hour process like it was yesterday. 

I got a Christmas bonus from work, and I knew it was going to go to dope. I wasn't even excited about it.

I was an active alcoholic for 9 years and thought getting off the booze was tough, but good God this is so much worse. My hospitalization due to pancreatitis from alcohol landed me a regular dose of 6mg morphine IV every 2 hours for a week, then getting out a script for 30 perc 15's with a refill. By that point I was addicted to opiates and was on heroin within a month, after I ran out of refills. 

It happens quick and before you know it you will be frantically picking little pieces out of bags, straws, your floorboard, carpet, old foil, anything to get well and stop the sweats and shakes.

Let me tell you something about my history of drug use: I was never into opioids, more into stims and psychedelics. In total I have tried 45 substances and only few of them were opioids. The notable ones were codein, tramadol and that was pretty much all I have tried. I have decided to take heroin, becuase I wanted to know, why are people addicted to it.

Now the experience: I have insufflated 40mg of heroin with my friend, who insufflated 30mg. After around 10 minutes, I started to feel it. It was awesome, so much better than any other opioid, I have tried. Surprisingly I was not drowsy and felt pretty fresh. During the experience everything felt like a dream.

I’ve been dishonest with the extent to my substance abuse with pain pills.. to my dream girl of a wife and innocent 3 year old daughter, now she says she doesn’t love me or know me.. which I don’t blame her. Although I just wish she knew how badly I didn’t do any of this to hurt her or my daughter. I tried keeping her in the loop with little hints here and there and when the times came, that she opened up (for instance today) let me talk I always shut down and was scared to.. why? I don’t know. She’s one of the nicest most honest people, I guess I just couldn’t bare the thought possibly loosing her over a mistake I got myself a little to deep into. She thinks I’ve been doing it for 3 years straight, which isn’t completely true, it started with a surgery, which was part of the beginning of the first two years it would come and go.. and when I mean come and go, I mean maybe a couple pills a few times a year, fun but nothin I cared much for or was deep into by any means.. she was pretty much fully aware of that. And it wasn’t serious so I see why we both didn’t think much of it. But then the last year has been hell, ended up getting way to many connections in the beginning of this year, people would trade me weed for pills which is cheap where I live.. that ended up coming to an end about 6 months once I realized it was messing my head up which in turn messes them up if I can’t be my normal self which I hate to ever do... anyhow, since about July I’ve been able to get stuff off and on consistently but never steadily.. so I guess you could say I got a buzz here and there. Never went that much out of my way but if it came I got it.. cuz at the time I was thinking “why not” not thinking about how it would make them feel. I guess it was just like drinking a beer to me here and there so I didn’t understand the effect it had on everyone around me but it definitely did cuz that shit screwed up my mood. Not justifiable. Boredom and stress is your worse enemy and trigger. And unfortunately this year has been full of it. Always stayed safe, never got “fucked up”.. just an enjoyable buzz when it was appropriate to. Never around our daughter, just usually a night thing to end the day. Nothing above 15-20mg was my rule, which somehow I thought was fine in the moment. But anyhow, regardless it was screwed up to do. And now she thinks I’m some junkie, coincidentally around the same time I decided that the party is over. Which I guess I am to some sense, a “functional one” but the fact of the matter is this isn’t worth it. Im done for good. As well as I lost my connect so it’s even better to use that as another motivation to stop. I’m never going back, it’s not worth loosing your family over. I just want to be the father and husband they deserve and have been lacking for much to long now. Now is my time to make a change, and try to heal any open wounds.. I just hope she gives me this one last chance. I’ve put so much weight on her shoulders and I’m so sick of letting her down this past year, but I have a feeling with me deciding within myself I’m done for good it should help stabilize my brain and put it where it should be. I just hope she gives me that one last chance.. I don’t know what life is without them. If only she could understand how badly I’m going, wanting, and needing to try my honest to god hardest to make it up to them both. I will not let this stop Me, it just teaches me a good lesson and if I would of been fully honest I probably wouldn’t be here. Never let down your family guys, it isn’t worth it.

Fast forward to today, I am sniffing (never shot, thanks needle phobia) any and all the dope I can possibly get my hands on. Yesterday, I sniffed an entire bundle in 20-30 min and didn't feel anything. I copped a second bundle that evening, didn't even BOTHER doing the whole thing because I know I wouldn't feel it! My tolerance is obviously insane, and I desperately need and WANT to quit, I think. Or, I wish the fucking drugs still got me high! I'm deathly afraid of needles and couldn't shoot myself up if I tried, and have no one to do it for me unless I were to ask someone on the street and do it huddled in a freezing alley, which I will STILL take a hard pass on. Anyways, I have been trying to quit now for some time, but always wind up going and scoring drugs and (trying) to get high, anyways. I live 10-15 min away from the hood in a large city where something is always available, 24/7. Needless to say, suboxone is also readily for sale in the area. I am not trying to delay my withdrawal by getting addicted to subs and then having to kick the medication eventually. My sis has been on methadone and tapering for years, good luck to her. I don't want to be a slave to a maintenance med, it's just my opinion, but I truly am beginning to feel like I may not be able to quit without one, or AT LEAST serious medical assistance during the week long detox. I'm just kind of blabbering, but can anyone offer any advice? Should I just.. I dunno, have someone lock me up in my apartment for a few days so I fucking have to kick, or is it even possible to ease W/Ds with suboxone for a few days or few weeks, then discontinue it relatively painlessly? I have never taken Suboxone before. Fuck, man, this just sucks.

TLDR; I need to quit H but I can't cope with the withdrawal on my own! Can I take subs on a short term without becoming addicted to them? Or does that not happen? ",1544890549.0

I have been in Pain management clinc for 6 months now and they only did urine test on me once and I did fine. I have a feeling that they will do another urine test for me on my next Pain management doctor appt in few days.

I have been prescribed with 90 10mg percs 3 times a day for a month for two months now.

I have a question about urine/drug test:

Do they only detect what kind of opiates I have in the system or will they also tell how much percs I have been taking in the system or both? Will they know if I have been taking more or less than what has presrcibed for me each day? for example, i take 6 percs a day then take only one perc next day instead of taking 3 times a day as prescribed. Will urine test tell that?

​

Also, i have been using white grapefruit juice and cimetidine (tagamet) for opiate potentiator, it really works. Will those show up on urine test?

\---

Part 2: 

The next day I spend the morning eating bagels and walking around. New York is an amazing city by any standard but it was a little boring being by myself. I got more excited around noon when Ted texted me back telling me he could meet around 4pm. Our meeting spot was in the projects--which is something I have virtually no real-world experience. It was still early in the day and hours away from our planned meet up but I decided to head over to Brooklyn and explore a bit beforehand.

On the subway over the bridge, I met a homeless man who went by Franky D. I gave him a couple cigarettes and we shared a smoke after we got off the train. I told him about the area I was headed to and he gave me a strange look. I asked him about it and all he said was,  “You’ll probably stand out a bit.” I’m a white male in my late 20’s and I was wearing chucks, jeans, and a black Northface fleece (ya’ll know I love my Northface jackets). Franky advised me just to get in and out and not hang around. Point taken. Thanks Franky.

After that, I just got some coffee and walked around, waiting for 4pm. It struck me how much the place looked like 50 cent’s movie, “Get Rich or Die Trying.” I’m no stranger to sketchy neighborhoods, but I’d be lying if I didn’t say I was a little nervous to be in such a foreign place. A place where I didn’t know a thing about any of the cultural nuances that proliferate the drug game. I figure my best bet was just to stick to the basics: Always be moving, not too quick not too slow, mind your own business, be alert of my surroundings but also keep your head down. Don’t stare, but don’t necessarily not look either. Blend in. Have a ready-to-go excuse in case I was asked by a cop what I was doing, and so on. Basics in dealing with a sketch environment. I knew my Bachelor’s Degree in Drug Game Dynamics would come in handy eventually.

Finally the text came: “we good bro. come at it.” I was at a coffee shop about a 10 minute walk from where the meetup was. So I tossed my branded coffee cup (not trying to walk through the projects with a Starbucks coffee cup) and headed out. On my walk there the neighborhood slowly deteriorated as I went, like a fucked up timelapse, getting sketchier by the block. 

When I was about a football field away from the building, I texted Ted and let him know I was there. He responded quickly and let me know he’s running a few minutes late and told me just to hang in the area. Ok, not a good thing but I can deal. I wasn’t dumb enough to just take a seat next to the projects while I waited for my drug dealer, so I kept walking past the building. 

When I crossed the next street, into the next block, it was as if I had stepped into a different world. The sidewalk and streets were bustling. Everyone, and I mean everyone, was wearing black and white, lot’s of tophats and wallet chains. They were those old school orthodox jewish people with the little curlies on the side of their head. I have since learned that I had stepped into a hasidic neighborhood. And it was pretty much a surreal experience. First off, it was like I was invisible. There were people everywhere but nobody would even look at me. This was fine and all, but I couldn’t help but worry about the fact that I stood out like a sore thumb. I finally knew what the homeless man, Franky, was talking about.

The men had their garb, the women had theirs, and the kids had their own little uniforms as well. Each gender had their specific haircuts and there was really no discernable deviation in personal style. It really felt like I was walking around in a cult, and it definitely threw me off. I really didn’t have an idea how to carry myself around the projects, and even less of how to do so in a goddamn hasidic jewish neighborhood.

It was such a weird experience walking around that place. I quickly gave up looking for a coffee shop to wait in because every storefront was written in hebrew and I had no idea if I was even allowed to go in. I just imagined sweaty, angry, jewish men shooing me out speaking in tongues.

So I just kept walking the same circle of blocks and waited for Ted. 

After about an hour of that I finally got the text. “come now, I’m good. text me when u here.” Hell yeah, I thought to myself, *let's get the fuck out of here.*

When I got to the corner, adjacent to the building, I texted Ted to let him know. He responded with a call. And I answered.

“Yo man, you here now? Where you at?”

“What up dude, yeah Im here Im just across the street.”

“Ok what you wearing homie?”

“Ummm, im wearing a black sweatshirt, sunglasses, and a black hat.”

At that point, I was like *Fuck, I’m retarded, I look like a cop. Oh well.*

“Aight I think I see you, wave ya hand”

“I’m in front of the liquor store,” I said as I waved my hand.

“Aight I see you… you uh… you sure you not a cop or nothin?”

“Nah man, not a cop.”

“Aight then, go around the building on the left side and walk in the back door, I got it propped open with a rock.”

*Jesus Christ,* I thought, *I’m about to get fucking jumped.*

“Umm ok… wait, where are you dude?”

“I’m up in the building, I’m watching you from my window.”

“Uhh, alright.”

“Ay so just call me when you get in.”

“K sounds good, later”

I did the junkie math in my head, and I figured I had a 1 in 4 chance of this being a set up. But, I’m a pretty strong guy, a little bit above average in size and height, and he knows I only got $100 bucks on me. Even though it would be a perfect situation for setting me up, I figured it wasn’t worth it for him.

If it wasn’t already obvious, I was the only white person on this block. I surely I stuck out and it made me uncomfortable. The buildings were laid out in groups of four, each forming somewhat of a square, with a small courtyard in between. Everything was old, ugly, and decrepit. Trash and graffiti all around. It took me a couple of minutes of walking around like an idiot to find the door he was talking about. It was propped open with a rock just like he said.

As I stood outside the metal door, I took a deep breath. By that point my hands were shaking and I felt like I was about to have a panic attack, but I did my best to hide it all. But on the outside I was calm and cool. I’ve gotten pretty good at faking that look. I entered the building.

It was a small entrance area, with dirty tiled floors and white walls stained with age. It smelled like a government building, I don’t know what that smells like, but that’s what came to mind, whatever that’s worth. Directly in front of me was a dimly lit hallway, but I couldn’t see where it led. The interior was lit by long tubes of buzzing fluorescent lighting, some of which were flickering on and off as if I had just stepped into a horror movie. On my right were little lockers that looked like mail boxes possibly. And on my left was a clunky metal elevator that looked like it hadn’t been updated since the 80’s. I was standing there on my own, and for how large the building was, and how many people likely lived there, I was surprised to see that I was the only one down there. I got out my phone and called Ted. 

While it was ringing, an older women walked in the same door I had come in. She began to mess with the mailboxes on the right. Ted answered.

“Yo you in there?”

“Yeah”

“Alright, look down to your left, there is a little metal box near the floor.”

“Ya, ok” 

I saw what he was talking about, it was a small metal electrical box close to the ground with it’s door slightly ajar. I looked over at the woman, then back at the box. I peeked in it.

*Holy Shit!* There it was, a small bundle of bags wrapped with a little black rubber band. The old woman then came over to me and pressed the button for the elevator. The look she gave me said, *“What the fuck are you doing here white boy?”* I gave her a look back that said, *“We both know what I'm here for, mind your business.”*

Ted cut back in, “Yo dog you see it or what?!”

“Ummm yeah, yeah I see...it.”

“Alright well grab it and leave the money in the same spot.”

*Damn*, I thought to myself, *this dude is very trusting. Either that or there is nothing in the little baggies. Junkie math says it’s 50-50 on that one.*

“Yeah aight… ummm just hold on a second… I got to wait a second.”

“Bruh just grab and go, you needa get the fuck outta there.”

“Hold on I can’t hear you. You’re breaking up,” I lied.

Finally, after what felt like an hour, the elevator came and the woman stepped on. She gave me one last lingering look as the doors closed. The second she was gone, I grabbed the stash, left my money, and bounced out of there as fast as I possibly could. I know I could’ve just grabbed it and ran, but I didn’t think it was smart to test the kind of person this guy was. For all I knew, he would have chased me down or had someone waiting outside if I tried that. Anyway, I didn’t give a shit at that point if he was scamming me, I just wanted to get the fuck out of that place.

As I’m jamming down the sidewalk, through the wave of jews parting before me, I texted Ted telling him we were good and that the money was there. He replied quickly with “got it.”

For all the variables there were to contend with, the deal actually went surprisingly smooth. The bundle of baggies in my pocket felt like it weighed 10 lbs. and I was brimming with excitement to find the nearest bathroom to try it out. It ended up being a much longer walk than I wanted because I had to get through the hasidic neighborhood, but I eventually found a normal coffee spot close enough.

I order a coffee and then headed straight for the bathroom. The sign on the door said “Out of Service,” but I walked in anyway, it wasn’t my intention to use the toilet anyway. I couldn’t help but smile.

Turns out, Ted was a man of his word. Each of the baggies was imprinted with a stripper swinging around a pole and the letters “XXX.” Each had what looked like a point of off-white colored ECP, almost a greyish color. I didn’t have any needles, so I racked up a small line (to test) and went to town.

It will suffice to say that the rest of that day was enjoyable, aside from a brief stint of nausea. I walked around a bit more and got some pizza. The claims are true. NY pizza is fucking delicious. I took an uber pool on my way back into the city instead of the subway and immediately nodded off. The polite girl next to me had to wake me up at one point because I was leaning on her shoulder. I think I was annoying her.

Now that my druggie desires had been met, later that night, my mind went to the next best thing. I messaged one of my Tinder matches, her name was Amy, and she responded fairly quickly. This was a good sign. 

Amy worked at a restaurant on the west side and was about to get off work. She was down to meet up at the bar across the street. I told her I would head there in 30 minutes. I did a few more lines in the bathroom, got dressed, called for an uber, and headed out.

I enter the bar and walk past a guy and girl on my right talking closely, then continued on to the main part of the bar. I look around and can’t seem to find her anywhere. Finally, almost as I am about to leave, the girl I passed on my right flags me down.

“Oh hey! Are you Lucas?”

“Yeah that’s me. You’re Amy?”

“Yeah! Hi!” She said as she went in for an awkward side hug. The guy to her left is still facing away from me toward the bar.

I motion towards the guy with my hand, “Do you...uhh… want me to leave?” I said, slightly thrown off and confused by the situation.

“Oh no, no, this is Mike, I just met him!” At that point the guy turns around and shakes my hand, clearly annoyed that I was interrupting their little one-on-one.

“He is here on a construction job, from Philadelphia.”

“Oh,” I say, “...cool.”

“Sit with us and have a drink!”

So there I am, awkwardly trying to have a date with a girl I just met while there’s also another guy hitting on her on her left side, also trying to have a date with this chick. *This is weird,* I think. 

But, she’s pretty hot and actually looked like her pictures, so I decide to wait it out and see if the guy will eventually take the hint and leave. Mike goes on to talk shit about Tinder, Bumble, and online dating in general. Saying how it’s only for pussies and a real man would meet a women in person first, that a real man wouldn’t need an app for that. *Right on Mike, thanks for your ground-breaking insight*.

Amy herself seemed pretty cool. She had long brown hair, a cute face, and a small yet curvy body. Right away I noticed that she has cut marks all up and down her forearms. Sure, a definite red flag. But who was I to make that judgement? They were not anymore a red flag than the scars on my own forearms (track marks).

After an hour or two, everybody is getting pretty tipsy and Mike has still not left. It appears this guy has doubled down and is in it for the long run. Oh well, I got my drugs and a sweet hotel, my night will be fun regardless. I tell Amy I’m going to go outside to have a smoke. I was likely to just walk away after my smoke and call it a night. Mike says something smart about smokers as I walk away.

It was damn chilly outside. I was perched up against the brick wall taking puffs from my cig when Amy comes outside in a rush.

“Hey! Mike went to the bathroom. I think we should go now.”

“Huh? I thought Mike was your friend or whatever?”

“Not really, he just started talking to me and I don't feel comfortable telling him to leave. I want to hang out with you,” she tells me as she leans in for a kiss. 

“Alright, I say, stay here, I’ll go close us out at the bar.”

So, I go inside to close out and as I’m signing the check Mike comes back to the bar.

“Ay, where’d the piece go?”

“I don’t know, she’s probably in the bathroom.”

“Oh right. You want a shot of tequila?”

“No,” I said as I turned and walked out of the bar.

She was outside looking scared and I told her to hustle away with me because Mike will soon find out about our little ruse. So, we were jogging along the sidewalk away from that place, laughing, and joking about what a D bag Mike was.

We were both feeling each other pretty good at that point in the night and we were deciding what to do next. She recommended that she comes back to my hotel with me. I tell her that’s not possible because my Dad is there. We can’t go back to her place either because her kids are asleep or something. I let her know I’m down to pay for a hotel, and she agrees that that’s a good idea.

It was about 1am by then but we still had no problem finding a hotel with vacancy. I paid more than I would’ve liked to for the room but I was fine with that, my dick was basically throbbing out of my pants, I was horny as hell. 

We bought some snacks and drinks at the front and got up to our room around 1:30am. We chat a bit and have a few drinks. I’m slowly starting to realize this woman is a little… off. She keeps asking me strange questions like, when are you coming back to NY to see me again? And, what girls I’m talking to at the moment. Keep in mind, I had known her for about 3 or 4 hours at that point. 

Of course, I ignore the warning flags and we have sex. It was really, really good sex. I know I’m not supposed to stick my dick in crazy, but if you haven’t figured it out yet I have no self-control regarding my hedonistic tendencies. She was down to take control and do whatever. We had a good time.

A little bit after sex, were are just sitting there hitting her little vape thing, and I decide I feel like doing a few lines. So, I think of some plan to do it without her knowing. I was planning on telling her that I’m going to hop in the shower or something, and then bust out the lines in the bathroom. But then I was just thinking to myself like, *fuck that. I paid for this room, I don’t even know this girl or care what she thinks, I’m never going to see her again after tonight anyway.* So I just whip out the baggies right there on the desk, and chop up a couple lines.

“Hey I’m gonna do some drugs now I hope you don't mind.”

“Ohh nice, can I have some?”

I paused, a little surprised, “This...uh… this is not coke.”

She looks at me from the bed, clearly confused.

“It’s heroin.”

Holy fucking shit. The her reaction was definitely not what I was expecting. She immediately starts bawling her eyes out. Going apeshit in the hotel room, running around the place trying to find all her belongings. She’s crying hysterically, yelling out: “I am just not down for that! Oh my god! I am not down for that! I have to leave, I have to leave!”

At this point I’m sort of frozen by shock of her freak out, *what the fuck should I do?*

*Jesus Christ, ok well, that didn’t go as planned.* By then, she’s getting a personal and is telling me what a terrible person I am. I’m a worthless drug addict and whatnot. She continues freaking out for a few minutes as she gathers up her things. After her tantrum she bolts out the door holding her shoes and her eyeliner running down her face. It was around 3 or 4 AM by then.

*Well, that was unpleasant*, I thought, *but in the end solves more problems than it creates, I suppose.* Now I don’t have to sleep next to her all night and listen to her go on about all this weird shit. I blew threw a few more lines as I sat there naked in the desk chair until I nodded off softly. I came to when I hear a loud knock at the door.

It was Amy, of course. She was standing out there trying to get some words out, and apparently after I opened the door, I said “What!?” a little too sharply (I think?). So, she just says “Fine,” and frustratedly trotts away down the hallway.

I happily got back to doing my thing at the desk and enjoy a nice nod. About an hour later I hear another knock at the door, this time even louder than the first. 

*Oh my fucking god, is this bitch serious? Just leave me alone Jesus Christ!*

I walk up to the door butt ass naked and throw it open. “WHAT DO YOU WANT?!”  My heart stops. 

It’s four NYPD policemen and a paramedic standing in the hallway.

“Oh,” I say. 

The officer closest to the door speaks first. “Hi there, we’ve heard reports that the was some drug use going on in this hotel room and that there may be someone overdosing. Can you let us know what is going on?”

I blink a few times, trying to think of something to say to buy some time. But, at a loss for words, they come out in a jumble, “I uhh.. I...no.. what? No drug use.”

“Sir, a very distraught, concerned woman called us and told us what is going on.”

“Amy?”

“I’m not aware of her name sir. But you should know that we are not here to get you into any trouble, we just want to make sure everyone is ok.”

“Um ok, well yeah, everyone is ok. Wait, there’s no one else. I’m everyone. It’s just me. I’m fine.”

“So then you probably wouldn’t mind if we came in a took a quick look around?”

“I’d rather not let you in. I’m just sleeping here. In my own hotel room. That I paid for. Minding my own business.”

The officer next to him chirped in, “That does make me a little suspicious that you won’t let us in, if everything is as fine as you say it is. Can you explain why you don’t want us to come in?”

“Because I respect my rights.”

That seemed to be the answer he wasn’t looking for because he kind of just shrugged, nodded his head, and stepped back.

The closest officer to me piped back up, “Alright listen man, will you just let the paramedic check your vitals? Again, we aren’t here to get you into any trouble, we just want to make sure everyone is ok.”

I rolled my eyes, “Once again, it’s just me in here. And if you want to check my vitals, go ahead and check my vitals, but this is clearly just that crazy chick trying to get back at me for not wanting her to sleep over. If anything you should be going after her for misuse of emergency services. Now, will you let me put some pants on, please?”

“Uh, yes. Quickly.” The officer responded.

I nodded, and shut the door. I bolt to the desk, wipe off the residue, unroll the dollar bill, and grab the baggies. I’m freaking out, my mind is racing as I run around my hotel room naked looking for a place to hide the drugs. I throw on my sweatpants. I don’t know how much time passed, I noticed I was sweating. It was a ridiculously surreal moment, I felt like I was in a dream, the adrenaline was overwhelming me. As I was desperately trying to shove the baggies into the air conditioner vent I hear a “click” and the handle of the door begin to turn. *What the fuck,* they were coming in.

I couldn’t get the baggies to fit in the air conditioner vent, so with nowhere else to put it, I threw them in my pocket and ran to the door as they opened it.

“Hiya, ya sorry I couldn’t find my pants but got them now.”

“Sir can you sit on the chair while we take your vitals please?”

As I sat down I slyly wiped off the rest of the residue that I had missed before. They took my vitals and everything was good. They kept pressuring me to admit I was using drugs. While one of the cops and the paramedic were focused on me, the others attempted to casually look around the room. They saw nothing but some clothes strewn about and some empty beer cans on the nightstand.

After I sufficiently persuaded the paramedic that I was not, in fact, dying, they gave me a few words of caution and finally agreed to leave. They left the room and I locked the door behind them, this time with the manual lock as well. The baggies were burning a hole in my pocket by then.

I was still in a state of shock, I couldn't believe that I had just gotten away with that without being arrested. Surely this was some trick by the cops to let my guard down, and any minute they would bust through the door to put me in cuffs and haul me off.

All at once I poured out the remaining dope and did the entirety in a few lines.

*Yes, yes, let’s get rid of the evidence, for good.*

Now high as fuck, I nodded off. When I awoke light was creeping in through the blinds. Holy shit, I’m not in jail, I thought to myself, surprised.

I immediately pulled up my phone and checked my Tinder account. Sure enough, Amy had already blocked me and her profile was nowhere to be found. Whatever, I wanted nothing more to do with this chick. If she believes me to be in jail right now, all the better.

I collected my things and headed back to my hotel. When I got back, my Dad was still asleep, it was early and he would be getting up soon. Right when I got into bed his alarm went off. He got ready, showered, and headed out without saying a word to me, presumably because he thought I was asleep.

*Fuck’s sake, I need to get out of New York.* Yesterday was a day to remember, what a crazy series of events. I don’t know how I got out of it. I consider myself very lucky. I always amazes me how, regardless of clean time, every time I get back to drugs the problems come back like I had never let off.

The 5 hour flight back was pretty miserable but nothing I couldn’t handle. I was withdrawing from the copious amount of heroin I’d done, even though it was for such a short amount of time. The whole ordeal of the previous day set me back on a straight line. I do miss that lifestyle every now and then, as sober life can be boring at times, but that trip was enough to replenish the reserves for a while, I hope.",1544914590.0

Also, I’m trying to not ramble or make this too long, so I’m giving what I think are important details. If you need more info, ask and I’ll let you know anything.

A little background: I’ve been doing pills (typically oxy 30s) daily for years. My tolerance is ridiculous. Back around the end of June, I made a new friend at work. She does dope. It’s cheaper, easy to get... I made the jump and have now been doing h daily. She and I are like partners in crime- we always make sure we each have some. We have picked up for each other. We have introduced each other to our dealers. We have also become friends- good friends (hang out a lot, our kids play, etc). Her son’s dad died (od on fent he thought was dope) back in early July. We vowed to help each other quit for the new year. There have been many times that we meet up and when it’s time to make a run, I’ll actually go grab the dope while she goes and grabs cigs, food, etc. I know she is always extra nervous. She was arrested last feb with her son’s dad. He took all the blame for everything in the car (even what was hers). Her charges were dropped to disorderly conduct. She had 90 days probation, but she is terrified of getting in trouble again. I’ve never been caught for anything (knock on wood).

Ok, so on thanksgiving eve, everyone we knew was dry. We were hurting and not together (I was at work). She was able to grab a little. She said it was shitty and she only grabbed a small bit. We were still looking for some. A friend of a friend of hers was going to sell her a bundle for $90 ( we usually pay $70). She called and asked my opinion. We were going to split it, but she was putting the $ up and I’d meet her later to grab and give her $45. She was sold garbage I honestly don’t even know what it was, but it wasn’t drugs. She freaked out. I told her I’d still give her the $45. Over the next day or 2 she made things sound like she was already good (remember she had picked up the little bit) and that she had only been grabbing the rest for me. I know she is hurting for $ (newly single mom, etc.), and although I’m not much better off I give her the full $90. She has countless times given me some when I had none, so it’s not like she typically would screw me. I wasn’t happy about it, but I know she was in panic mode for $.

So yesterday, neither of us had much money, so we were going to split a bundle. She was going to grab it and I’d see her at work later to give her $ and get my half. I had no way to go do this as I share a car with my husband and he was using said car. Of course, she got popped. I feel awful.

Today I'm going to stay with a friend for 4 days and attempt to go cold turkey (aided with some benzos and other things). I've tried everything else, and this is my last ditch effort to get back on track.","Not giving up or anything if this fails, I will always keep trying, but at this point, this feels like the only way out. I know that the cold-turkey success rate is like 5%, but honestly, if anyone can do this, it's me. I'm so ready to be done with this whole thing.

I've managed to stay in college and maintain decent grades while smoking 2 points a day. I know I can't keep it up forever. Eveything I do feels like I'm using my last bit of effort to do it. 

Over these 8 months, I have done so many little things to avoid accommodating for, or normalizing the addiction. I thought ""if you change nothing, you have the same life to go back to if you quit"". I'm starting to feel like I'm doing that less well, so if I want it to be true, I need to do this now. 

I finally reached out for support to someone I really trust, and they are getting me out of the place I use and away from the people I use with, giving me a place to stay and withdraw, and keeping me busy and benzoed. I'm infinitely lucky to have this kind of support. But I don't ever want to have to ask this of anyone who cares about me again. It feels like too much even to ask for this. 

Wish me luck. I'll update and let you guys know how it goes. Advice is more than welcome. 

Edit: I've made it through almost 4 days now and I feel mostly out of withdrawal, aside from some muscle aching. Not currently taking anything aside from my prescribed anti-anxety pill. I feel exhausted from writhing in bed in pain for days. I'm still not used to sleeping without heroin - which has really been the hardest part. I'm having some pretty serious cravings, but have stayed away from opiates, the people I was using with, and the places I was using. Non opiate users only until I feel steady.

She was telling me about how her last BF never closed the bathroom door and never washed when he was finished.  OK, I got the hint. No problem.

But then I made the mistake of all bathroom mistakes that any man could make - I LEFT THE TOILET SEAT UP!

Well, you'd think that I had set off a bomb in her house.  She bitched at me for at least 15 minutes straight . I tried  to explain to her that I had not lived with a woman since March 2015 and that I was out of practice. Then, she started-up again and said that she didn't have time ""to train a man"".

That set me off. LAST STRAW. I am NOT A DOG AND I DON'T NEED TO BE TRAINED. So that's it guys. No more Church Girl. Probably for the best. ",1544848590.0

But I guess fucking not, i guess everyone can expect me to treat them and there things in a certain type of way, and i always FUCKING DO, but Noooooo, I cant even begin to think people will do the same for me.



Long story short,  i grow a personal amount of weed for myself. I have an almost professional level setup which cost me just under 2200. 3x3x6 tent, optic 6 LED grow light, well built inline duct fans, basically the works. I have been working a shitload and normally when I leave the lights havent come on yet, and I had been asking my wife to check her (the plant) and report to me on days I might not get a chance to. She kept saying ""looks alright to me""..... well now I know what ""looks alright to her"" is a goddamn almost dead plant. So right away I begin trying to explain to her what needs to be done, and that she needs to do it asap,  or there goes my grow. So after saying that she does not understand at all, I just say that it fucking whatever and I'll take care of it as soon as I get home in like 3 hours (I realize that saying a transplant and shit needed to be done ASAP was a little bit of hyperbole but it did need to get done, but not now), but if she could pull out everything I was asking so I could just get to work when I got home. 


That's where the trouble begins and is still going on. The bag of soil amendments which I literally needed,  is gone. It's been sitting in the same fucking place for like a month, waiting for the right time, and it's just gone. And that's the thing, that's the thing that has me FUCKING FUMING. While I may make a decent little bit, my family and I are still barely making it because of decisions my fucking mother made, which basically made it so if me and my wife want our own place again, my mom will be homeless,  nice right? And I have a somewhat costly opiate addiction to boot, which is my own problem and kine alone. So now, because I cant get these amendments without waiting several days,  and my plant is already bad enough, I'm going to lose my fucking plant, which this was my last seed, because I dont sell any for any amount of profit,  I only sell enough to start my next grow and that's it, maybe like a oz every time to someone I know, literally just to get my soil, seeds, and amendments, to begin each time with, and because of my financial situation, I cant replace the fucking amendments, and like it's really more like replacing the amendments, seeds, and possible nutrients I need, which all relied on that stupid fucking 25 dollar bag of amendments I already had.



I'm sorry for the rant, I've had a long ass week, I hate this fucking season, and now its like the one thing I cared about, besides my family, and is literally the one thing I have asked them not to mess with, unless I ask them to do something, or I want to show them something, is now IMO ruined, or atleast not usable until I have money to replace a bunch of shit, which unleas I'm willing to get sick for a day or two, I cant do for the foreseeable future.

I've delt with my friend being murdered in my own home because some dudes were trying to rob me, jail time, sorrows ect..

Story time

Fast forward a few years. I get out of jail October after serving around a year for a petty felony. I get out, no where to go. Mom gives me the ole ""One last time yo get your shit together."" stipulations of moving home to a particular sunny state in the south I have to 

1. No drugs 
2. Go to the suboxone clinic
3. Start Hep C treatment.

I move after being released after ripping and running for about a week. I get home to this sunny state where micky mouse lives and things are going well. Get a decent job at UPS, sub clinic, yada yada. I do what I was obliged to do.

4th week in the clinic I get upped to 8s and have a hankering for some boy. I meet this dude who said this guy will trade me a few packs for a few subs. Cool drive about an hour and a half to do the deal. I tell the guy, hey I need my wrappers because I have to bring them in each visit. Oh yeah its cool dude said he'll hold onto them and give you a free pack when we come back to get them... Mmmm okay I guess. 

Fast forward about 3 days, get a phone call from my clinic. ""Hey we need to do a count and a random UA."".... Uh fuck! So I stall it off until Friday when I get paid again and can go back to where I sold em and get my wrappers. 

Friday comes, I'm swettin it. Praying my wrappers will be there. Make an excuse at work why I have to leave yada yada, not before copping 2 dilaudid 8s first. My favorite drug and haven't done one since I got out. Get two 8s for like 60 bucks. Go pick up the middle man and head to town to get my wrappers. 

We get there and of fucking course the guy with them isn't home... We finally get a hold of him and he's all omg I just had them I can't find em... Mother fucker. So I grab .2 of some boy to heal my woes and go to the gas station to get a shot in. My middle mans girl calls some dude she knows. 

""Hey he's got some!"" yes! Sweet sweet relief. We wait for ever to meet the dude while time is ticking down to make it to the clinic for my test and I'm supposed to go back to work to finish my delivery route. 

Dude meets us, he only has 2 wrappers... I needed 5 and 3 unopened one's. Dudes cool though and gives me some fire ice though and tells me good luck and if I get kicked out the clinic he'll help me with what ever I need. 

Feeling defeated we make our way back home. So then work calls me... Hey did you abandon your route? I explain how I go to the sub clinic and HAD to go in or I would lose my script. They were cool and said no worries we have someone finishing it up. Woohoo ill take that as a single W. So then I call my clinic to see when I had to be there. Come to find out my nurse had to leave early for the day and I can just come in Monday! Second WooHoo! More Ws! 

So now I'm on my way home and i have to pick up my kitten from the vets. End up having to pay like 30 bucks when it was supposed to be free... Ut owe, funds are running low and I'm supposed to pay my mom back 50$ and have enough money to make it back and forth to work all week plus cigs. 

Well mom gets suspicious I only have X amount of money left and wants to see my pay stub and jot down everything I spent money on today. I proceed to tell her oh no that's how much money I have after I pay you back. I'm sorry you misunderstood. Yeah she still wants to see my money and make a list and see my pay stub.... Back to the Ls.

I make up a fake list of stuff. Gas, cigs, food, the vet, lunch ect. And thank the Lord I was able to talk my neighbor into loaning me 70$ just to show my mom.

Everything goes off with out a hitch, mom buys it. All good in da hood..... Moral of the story is...

Jesus fucking Christ that was not worth it at ALL. Sure I did 2 dilaudid 8s, qt g of some boy and some ice today but holy fuck that stress and close calls was not worth it what so ever.  

Thanks for listening to my iced out rant, I just had to vent to some people who would understand. I think I'm just going to go back to taking my subs like I'm supposed to lol

Tonight, I randomly try it again on a long shot, and it's a Christmas Miracle. It's unlocked & I have just enough to buy one 40mg Opana.. Call my Dgirl. She's been blowing my phone up all week begging me to bring her my usual $300/day. She's an addict herself and her life (high) depends on me and other unfortunate opiate addicts purchasing her product. Even better she's randomly closer to my house than usual. As most opiate addicts - at 28 -she generally doesn't stray far from her parents house or her mooching boyfriends car.

I've been in misery for 3 days. Getting by on the sketchy rewashes of Opana Cottons and the few remaining dollars I had. 

I get home - resisting the urge to break the pill down in my car and snort it in the KFC Parking Lot... So I can bang it and get the the most from it. I break the pill in half with the totally false notion that I'm going to save the other half for the morning. Extract it, and finally register. Very clean register.. Tons of Blood flowing back into the reservoir..  I push off.. After 3 days of being on the cusp of full blown WDs & nonetheless feeling (typically - comfortably) awful.. And the feeling is fucking indescribable. Every single time.. is amazing. I literally melt into my PC Chair.  I feel like a Hershey Kiss with a blow torch 2 inches away.  

God Damn. This life is a lot of misery, but those 30 seconds almost make things worth it. Hopefully things will get better for us opiate addicts at some point here in the USA. Legalizing Opiates - So many lives would be saved, parents 401ks intact, so many highly intelligent young men and women who are dying to work would be shoveling the coals of capitalism into the economy - but for now we can just hope to look forward to that next $100.. that next clean register followed by that rush of euphoria - a godlike state that no cookie cutter normie could ever understand. 

Stay strong  friends. I hope the poppy is plentiful for you this Christmas Season. Enjoy it while you have it & if you're in a dark place and sickness is creeping in - just know it won't last forever. Sooner than you know it you'll see that blood fill the reservoir and be on your way to that fleeting cloud 9 where we wish to reside forever.

God Bless

Insufflation is essentially useless. Plugging has like double the bio of oral and injection is obviously top. 

However what I don't quite comprehend is when I plug morphine it doesn't seem any stronger then an oral dosage. It seems to just be equal to an oral dosage and sometimes even weaker. 

 I do go to the bathroom and defecate/clear myself out before plugging so it's not like I'm backed up or the drug is being absorbed by any wayward shit. Just found it strange. I have read before though that the oral bio ranges quite a bit so maybe I'm just a higher metabolizer then most? Still doesn't explain why I'm getting better effects swallowing it though then plugging since plugging should still be significantly stronger I would say. 

The pills are 100mg kadian slow release morphine. The ones that are encapsulated and have tons of extended release balls in them. I take 500mg a day.

I am kicking black and white so I am all over the scale of shitty. My first day kicking, I went to my girlfriends Christmas party for work. I don’t drink, even when I am using, so I just sat around watching everybody get hammered. When it was over and I though it was time to go home, all the drinks decided to take the party to another local bar. I didn’t feel like sitting by myself in a corner while kicking a habit, so I went home to our kids. When I got them in bed, that little voice inside my head told me that i should take the opportunity to go get high before I had to pick her up. I wrestled with the thought so hard that I went into a full fledged panic attack which turned into a manic episode. I ended up speeding to the bar and running in like a psychopath and hugging my girlfriend because I convinced myself that she died. I calmed down a bit and assured her I was ok and that I wanted her to stay and have fun. I went home and spent a couple hours talking to a wall. After I picked her up and got her in bed, I lost it even more. Around 3 am, I went outside for a cigarette and saw a man sneaking around my neighbors house. He had on an orange shirt and long gray hair pulled back in a pony tail. The only problem was that he was at least 11 feet tall. I turned on my flashlight on my phone and started to chase him. As soon as he got around a corner, he disappeared and I was left standing in my neighbors yard yelling “where the fuck are you hiding big boy?” I have been diagnosed with bi-polar two by a couple doctors but my manic episodes have never been severe. Maybe it was from detoxing, but this was the worst freak out I have ever had, even when on several drugs and awake for days. It was like I was witnessing all of it happen, but I couldn’t stop it. After my girlfriend got me inside, I fell asleep from 3 am on Thursday and woke up at 6:45 am today, like nothing happened. I feel like shit and I remember bits and pieces of my incident but I am glad it’s over. It’s been a rough 3 days, but Monday I enter an intensive out patient program. I finally admitted to my work that I am an addict, and not only did they not fire me, they asked how they can help. They are going to work my schedule around an outpatient program so I can finally get real help. I am 32 and I dropped acid for the first time at 12. After that it was on a cracking with whatever drugs I could find. I graduated high school and always have a had a job. I manage a water company now, but a 20 year drug career is good enough for me. My girlfriend of 13 years and our 2 kids deserve the best me possible. I need to make her my wife, and I need to show her the love and respect that I couldn’t show her while using. My kids need a dad that is not only there for them, but a dad that’s not high. Even if they can’t tell, I know I can be a better man. This sub has gotten me through some shit. I have had some laughs, I have come here when I felt like I was losing my mind and grip on reality, and there was always something to make me laugh, or something to make me not feel so alone. I thank you to everyone who has posted on here, or left a comment or sent me messages. You guys are all a bunch of amazing people. Whether you’re currently in active addiction, trying to get out, already out, or never had a problem and your just here for fun, I love you all and I hope that you have found happiness in life. Treat each other right and treat yourself right. Thank you.",1544829323.0

a68ipy,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/a68ipy/question_for_iv_crack_users/,10,https://redd.it/a68ipy,blackdiamond801,Question for IV Crack users,"Hey folks,

I know this isn't an opiate question, but this sub has the best community and the most knowledge. I think that shooting heroin (dilaudid, oxymorph, etc.) is a point in a drug users life that generally means nothing is too 'hardcore' or 'crazy.' I'm not saying that all IV heroin users also bang coke and meth, but they've likely tried it (some hate all stims) or would be willing to try it if they have an appetite for uppers. 

So back to my question, I've been shooting crack for the past few weeks after mainly smoking it for a while. I had shot it before, but the prep work used to keep me away. Putting a rock in a pipe with a little chore is a very simple task compared to breaking it down with water plus vinegar, citric acid or whatever in a cooker. Yeah, I'm lazy because it's really not much work haha. 

So every time I fix up a shot, I'm left with a decent amount of residue around the cotton that obviously doesn't end up in that shot. It's much too thick to draw up, and kinda like a paste. It's great for doing another shot, but I'm wondering if that is a result of too little (or much) vinegar, too little water, not letting it sit long enough or something that I can't figure out. 

I've been trying to do a really fat shot, but this keeps preventing me from getting as much in the rig as I'd like. Any advice on getting it all into my rig, and avoiding the relatively good amount of byproduct? I'm using vinegar as my acid if that makes a difference. 

COMPLETELY RANDOM TANGENT: Any IV users sometimes wish they could show off their skills to people? Silly I know, but I used to think about how my IV skills could potentially come in handy one day. A zombie apocalypse or surviving the world getting nuked out of existence are my go-to scenarios. A co-worker gets seriously injured, and I'm able to hit her first try with the morphine that I [of course] stole from the pharmacy. I never end up doing all of the drugs myself (I would do it all for sure), and everyone keeps needing me to hit them with morphine constantly... I seriously thought about this for hours before hahaha. 

Hope everyone is having a great Friday and staying safe out there! This community is special and always helps me with the isolation that comes with drug addiction, so thanks to you all. ",1544819188.0

This has been a long and tiring time. So after making it there and back safely, but getting home to find out I had been sold packs of cut and not dope... I've finally gotten well, high even, so I'm gonna tell this story of karmic retribution. Hopefully you are entertained by my hypothetical situation... 

After 3 long days of working, being too busy and not having ride nor reason to go down to The Hood, sickness getting worse and worse, desperation started to sink in. I concocted a plan to steal my grandfather's car in the middle of the night to go cop. I knew it was a massive risk, I could lose my living situation and ruin the trust and relationships i had gained back with my family after years of drug use. I could lose my freedom as I don't have a license, and presumably I'd be driving with drugs in the car, possibly with paraphernalia and high on the way back.

The plan started out as basically a dopesick fantasy of let's somehow get the key and then take the car. Then I really started to consider it.... But how would I pull that off? well let's start by getting the key, and if I can actually do that, the rest will make sense. He's got a bunch of shit on his keychain so when he wasn't looking, I snatched just The car key, sliding it off of the key ring, figuring he wouldn't notice since there are so many other keys. It was a gamble, but it worked. He didn't notice. 

Now I had to think about how I was gonna slip out in His car without him noticing that its gone, along with myself. I thought about the situation. His car is almost silent when it's turned on, and the garage door is brand new, so it too is silent. You can't hear either one in the house, not even right next to The door. He's in the living room watching television, so he would see me go into the garage. I decided that I would leave when he was asleep later tonight. His room is on the other side of the house entirely so there's no way he would be able to hear me leaving in his car, especially if he wasn't awake. 

He finally goes to His room around midnight.. The second I heard snoring, I made my move. I opened the door to the garage slowly and quietly, and I walked out to the car. I can still hear snoring. I smile to myself and close the door to the house. I get in the car and slowly close the door, not wanting to make too much noise. It wasn't closed all the way but it was closed enough for now. I opened the garage with the garage door opener on the visor in the car and turned the key. This is it I'm 100% going! I'm getting well tonight after 3 long days of sickness. I couldn't be more excited.

I pull the car out of the garage and close the door again. I pull out of the subdivision into the main road, and I drive a few miles to the freeway. I hope on, then turn on some Christmas music and drive the half hour drive to the hood. I was the only car in the highway for most of the trip. I turned on the windshield wipers. They said it was supposed to show tonight, lucky for me that it's too warm and it's raining slightly instead.

I get to my exit and pull off, making a few turns before I get to the street I know so well. I had been coming here for years, first to the spot across the street, unprofessional place with no deals, always getting raided. One day they were out of dope and the girl I was hanging out with who lives there told me I could go across the street to the side door and it's another dope spot. 

That was about six and a half years ago and I've been going there ever since. This dope house was the safest dope house you could imagine. This guy ran it but was never there cause he had workers. They worked in shifts and it was 24/7/365. You just knock on the door. This door was barricaded just in case the cops tried to break it down... But that's as never gonna happen because of monthly payoffs to the local precincts narcotics division. This guy had this street on lock. 

Speaking of safe, this dboy pays people in dope to bring him as much narcan as they can. He sees this shit as a business and respects the customer, treating them well if they are big spenders and long time clients. Anyways, after walking in the barricaded door, you have stairs to your right and a door to the basement opposite, along with a hallway and series of rooms where the employees live. The stairs to the next floor take you up into another hallway with two doors, one into another employee room and the other into the hangout spots. Two rooms with tables and sterile water packs, bags of cotton from the exchange, and alcohol pads. There was a third room too, another employee room (this business employs about ten people, one of the only job opportunities in the area) but this employee sells new rigs. I

There was graffiti on the walls, so and so was here, rip, no begging, one day at a time, all kinds of addict shit. It was sorta dirty, slightly grimy, pure hood spot. It was heaven on earth. This time I just grabbed my shit and dipped, but normally I would run upstairs and sit at those tables, sometimes doing a small shot and leaving, other times doing a nice big shot and lighting a cigarette, relaxing and nodding for a few hours, sometimes talking shit with the other clientele. 

I hopped back on the highway,racing home to do a shot, but using cruise control to stay the speed limit, not wanting to risk getting pulled over and going to jail sick. I pulled off and I made it back safely. I snuck back into the house and ran to my room to fix up. Threw a pack in my spoon and mixed up. Pulled the solution into my rig and tied off, hitting my eager vein with ease after registering, seeing the red plume of blood slipping into the syringe. 3...2...1... And... Still dopesick? What's going on?

I shot all the rest of the packs... Nothing. After all that, I got sold cut?? I thought about karma for hours, wondering what the odds where that after pulling off such a maneuver it just so happened to be the one time my plug got ripped off..ever... Going through a fairly new connection for him, His junkie testing the bag was in on the scheme.. 

I couldn't believe it. What a nightmare. I tried to sleep, having to work in the morning, but also potentially having a ride to a nearby town I could take a bus to the hood from. I texted my plug to let him know what happened. He told me if I could get down there again that he would do something for me on him. 

I actually fell asleep somehow, but waking up a few hours later soaked in sweat after having a dope dream. I went to work, tortured by my brain and body screaming for dope, my actual chronic pain feeling ten times worse than normal. I make it through a grueling shift and get picked up, to be dropped off in the town next to the city. I quickly take a bus to the crossroads I cop at. 

I get back to the spot, feeling deja vu for some reason. The worker calls my plug and runs to grab reimbursement packs from the basement. I drag myself upstarts and finally get myself well. Feeling pins and needles along with hunger as my body normalizes. I light up a smoke and enjoy a nod, a nice surprise from doing just half a pack expecting only to get well. There seems to be no problem in the world for a few moments. I leave the trap and head home, finally well, big goofy smile on my face, wishing I would have just waited to begin with, but glad to not feel the pain for another few days...

I was prescribed 10/325 percocet several years ago and I had taken anywhere from 3-4 a day. 

I had a really terrible autoimmune arthritis just show up out of the blue and it was so bad I couldn't even get out of bed for nearly a year until they figured it out.  

Anyway, to the point.  I took these pills religiously for several years and the arthritis would come and go after I started taking a biologic.  I felt a lot of pain and misery even between the biologic but functional.

I decided that I did not want to take opiates anymore so I quit them a month ago.  I must say the entire process was not a pleasant affair, the first week forget it.   

Even at a month I have difficulty getting to sleep.  I am currently sleeping every other night and not when I want to.  I sit in bed 10 hours sometimes trying and can't.

That isn't why I am here asking though, just thought i would share that miserable part.  The real reason I am here is that the pain I experienced daily has vanished since I have stopped taking them.

I thought perhaps the pain was from joint damage before the biologic but nope, it's gone now.  All those years taking those things I think might have been caused from taking them.

Seems odd right?  Any thoughts?

I did once about 10 years ago on bluelight forums I think they were called and was told to “stop lying and inciting fear”. However, in the last decade it’s become far more prevalent and there’s been way more studies. 

So from in 2004 I was diagnosed with small cell liver cancer. I was prescribed OC 80s and Lortab 10/500 (Vicodin) for breakthrough pain. Dr. Would never increase my OC, but would give me all the lortab I wanted. Fast forward three years to 2007  and I was taking approximately 10-12 lortab a day which equals around 5-6000 mgs of Tylenol a day. It was about this time of year and I went to visit my parents in eastern wa. I started noticing really bad tinitis in my ears and when I stood up or when I walked my balance was all over the place. The closest thing I could describe it as was if felt like I was constantly under water. 

I was watching tv in my room at my parents and my dad comes in and said “do you realize your tv in here is louder than the tv in the living room?” We can’t hear our tv over yours. I had no idea. My husband said to me earlier that day that he’s had to repeat himself to me multiple times to get me to hear him. Huh, off to the emergency room. 

ER doc said oh ya must be and inner ear infection. Here’s some steroids and abx. Ok cool go him start meds. Next day I wake up and the best way I can describe what I heard was a balloon slowly letting out air.  Not so it squeaked, just a rushing of air. Then nothing. Back to ER, ok stronger abx more prednisone. It will slowly come back. I never heard another sound naturally. The Tylenol toxicity that was eventually diagnosed after getting to an otolaryngologist caused me to go from perfect hearing to nothing in less than 3 weeks. 

My kids were 8, 3, and 3.  Try getting your 3 year olds to understand mommy’s ears don’t work anymore. If you want to talk to her, you have to look at her so she can try and read your lips. My 8 year old had to grow up quick. She became the third parent. She felt like she couldn’t go out and play if my husband was at work for fear of one of the twins falling and hurting themselves and I wouldn’t hear. I was totally deaf for 10 months. Then I received a cochlear implant in my right ear. Which allows me to hear about 50% of normal in one ear. Music doesn’t exist for me anymore because my implant only allows me to hear about 23 different tones. So overlapping sounds are impossible and music in only 23 tones sounds horrible. It’s difficult for me to hear in restaurants, I tried to go to a comedy show, which didn’t work because people laughing made it so I couldn’t hear the comedian continue their bit. I have to make sure a movie theater offers CC before I can go to a movie, which is much better than a decade ago. 

I just beg you. If you’re ingesting a lot of Tylenol...stop. Don’t. It’s not worth it. I was 27 when I lost my hearing. I beat small cell liver cancer, thank God, one of the highest mortality rates of any cancer. So losing my hearing could be much worse, but it didn’t have to happen. If you are noticing tinnitus stop now. It’s not worth it. I know I’m repeating myself, but being deaf, losing one of my senses, is one of the hardest things I’ve ever had to deal with. I was depressed for a long time. Thank God for my family. Be safe everyone. ",1544773671.0

40

I ride the bus over to the old trap motel room.

But I get off a few blocks up from the stop that’s closest to it, so I can get something to eat at McDonald’s. When I get up to the counter a pretty girl takes my order which is for two sausage biscuits, a small orange juice and a cup of coffee. She puts a tray on the counter and my food and drinks on top of it. I ask for a few packets of grape jelly, because sausage biscuits with grape jelly are my favorite to eat for breakfast, and so I go sit at a table over in the corner and open the wrappers of the sandwiches and put jelly on them and then squirt the other packet onto the paper so I can dip the sausage biscuits right into some extra jelly. They really are my favorite thing to eat for breakfast. One time, when I was starving and homeless on the street, this guy woke me up with a five-dollar bill and gave me a few cigarettes. I’d been sleeping under the overhang of a strip mall in front of a nail salon. It was raining. Instead of using that money for another pack of cigarettes or waiting to get another few bucks to go in on a bag with someone so that I could get well, I walked directly to McDonald’s to buy and eat five sausage biscuits with grape jelly in a row. 

So, I’m sitting there scarfing my food the way I always do so that I can barely even breathe and choke on it once or twice between slurping at the orange juice. It’s still dark outside. Traffic is slow to move on Sunday mornings like this, but eventually it’ll take off. The sky has a few violet veins of what look to be promises of daylight running through the clouds, and across from me at another table a woman holds her cup of coffee in a pair of dirty skeleton hands. She wears a purple hoodie that’s in good condition, but a little dirty. I can tell she’s homeless and high. There’s that blissful crimp of her lips on her face and the pin pricked pupils that heroin gives people. For me it’s easy to see. It’s like an aura of warm glamour shot fuzz that she wears, and I can see. The lady is pretty, still in her early 40s I would guess with big eyes and no wrinkles but the obvious wear and tear of life on drugs and the streets. The fact that she’s high so early in the day means that she’s got something figured out. When I was on the streets, I was always sick in the morning and had to hit licks to come up for the day. But, then again, girls fair better than men in that regard out here. They have what is arguably the most sought-after commodity in the history of the world, but it’s not fun living like that however good the drugs feel. It all comes at a heavy price.  

After eating I make it up to the old trap motel room, number 127 at the Lindell Motor Lodge. It stinks as badly as it ever did, so I hear. I can’t tell, though. That’s just what the customers say. The gun I bought when I first started selling and living here lives under the bed. It just doesn’t feel necessary for me to be toting that thing around everywhere I go. I still want to have it. I just don’t want to have it with me, so I leave it here. Makes me feel better. Even if it doesn’t make sense.

Customers show up one by one. Peanut Boy comes by with Barbie. Eddie is in and out every morning, but I’m always giving him his daily amount to work out of and he gives me the cash for whatever I gave him the day before. Other bicycle and flashlight people come in for smaller amounts. I usually only sit there until 12 and let Eddie handle the business from his room after that, but in the five hours or whatever it is I usually sit there, I make anywhere between 700 to 1500 dollars. That’s every day and not counting the people who get quantity like Sharky or Cheese or even Martin from me after I’m done here. Sal shows up at nine or so and walks right in. I always meet him at Dee Dee’s place. Never here. 

“What’s up Junky Vonnegut?” The way he says it isn’t even the same.

“Sup, Sal?”

“Nothing man. Just came by looking for a little bit bigger piece than usual.” He usually only gets a couple grams at the most. 

“Yeah. I think I can do that for you. What were you with Sharky for last night?”

“Oh, man. You know. Just doing our thing, bro. We’ve been working hard out here. Got some bigger clients now. That’s why we got what we got last night and gotta get this issue right here.”

“I didn’t know you guys were that tight.”

“Yeah. Man. What? You think I’d just drop some stranger off in your lap like that, man? Not me!”

“I just didn’t know. What you looking for?”

“I need a zip.”

“An ounce?”

“Yeah.”

“Okay.”

I get the scale out and weigh one out for him out of the bag I just got from Old Man earlier this morning. Sal holds it up and studies it. He laughs.

“Nice, man. Real nice.”

“Yeah.”

“Well, I gotta bust out of here. Hit me up later. Or I’ll hit you up.”

We bump knuckles. He slams the door. I finish out my little trap shift and head back to the apartment. It’s time for me to get mine and nod out for a bit. ",1544771822.0

So I recently found an old bottle of 5/325 hydros at my house, prescribed from earlier this year. I ended up never taking them and forgot about them. In the past I've enjoyed small doses of opiates here and there, mostly codeine and hydrocodone. I remember I used to take 20mg of hydro and I would have one hell of a nod. This time around I'm not getting any positive effects whatsoever. Just very spacey and nauseas. It almost feels as though I have a concussion.

Yesterday I grabbed two, split the pills in half and took them in the afternoon. An hour or so later I just felt tired and like I was gonna vomit. I shrugged it off as my first time doing any opiates in a couple years so I waited 8 hours, did a proper CWE (to be clear, I have lots of experience with CWE, so this is not the issue), and took 15mg worth, and had the same effect, only stronger. No euphoria, no warm feeling. Only nausea and, well, pain killing effects, although not pleasant at all. I tried smoking some low THC high CBD cannabis to relieve the nausea, only for it to perpetuate the gross feeling.

Earlier this afternoon I thought that I would try something right in the middle, and worried that it was a problem with my CWE, simply took two and a half pills (12.5mg hydro, 816mg APAP). I felt sedated, sure, but it was that same horrible feeling. Nausea, no warmth, heavy head, sedated, mild headache, etc. Everything you would associate with opiates if you took out all of the positive effects.

Anyone else experience this? You know, maybe this is a good thing. I've never been one to grow to habituate opiate use, but no one is immune to it's allure when things are working as expected with the drug. Even so, I would love to know if anyone else has felt anything similar to this.

Thanks in advance.

I chuckle and upvote the memes like ""when he says he's about to pull up, he's just leaving the house"" etc. cause I have had to deal with that on occasion with my plug and backup dealers, but for the most part my dealer rocks!

I've been going to him/her mostly daily for about 2.5 years now, let's call him Bub, but he got popped a year ago and now his girl runs it, so she goes by Miss Bub. They run a real professional, nice business with good deals and fast runners (I've only met the actual Bubs a few times). In the daily trips for 2.5 years, there's been maybe 3 days they weren't good and I had to use a backup, maybe 3 more when the phone was off for a few hours but came back on. She's consistently open from 7am-11pm (sometimes if I'm late I'll use a backup, which always makes me appreciate my plug more). I rarely wait more than 20min at the spot, usually 10, and often the runner is there waiting for me!!

Not only that, they've had consistently good shit this whole time, it's just honestly my favorite in this area, and because I'm such a good customer, I can ask for a front once, sometimes even TWICE a week, typically in the mornings cause they know I'm coming back later with money. (The front is usually just 2 dime bags but it gets me well till I can get more cash). No expectation to pay it back, and she's never said no to me. I'd say on average I ask for that once a week, but buy a good amount 6/7 times a week. If I do have to wait a while, they throw in extra typically.

I decided to make this post cause she just sent out a text with her ""Christmas specials"" lol and they're some damn good deals! I know I can get a great deal at 7am sharp tomorrow morning. It's just nice not having to deal with middles and shit plugs. I know cause some of my backups are just slow, greedy, unprofessional, and their shit is inconsistent.

My family doesn't remotely resemble anything that it was when she was still here. I use to love the holidays and each year since she has passed has gotten worse and only made me resent them more and more. I miss her so much, we were really close. She was the most awesome lady, no judgement ever only love! My home was always open to my friends, dinner was made every night and it was always enough for 10 people! Even as I got older, right before I moved out, she would still wait up in the living room usually fast asleep by the time I got home but I would always go check (my room was separate from the main house) and sure enough she was there just to make sure I got home safe and to ask me how my day was and remind me she loved me. My father is another topic, but let's just say he was probably the worst person who reacted in the most awful kind of way. He was not there for me or my sister, he kicked us out of the house in the pouring rain 2 days before Thanksgiving all bc I stood up to him in defense of my mom as he had some mental breakdown and verbally degraded his dying wife of 36 years who was to sick from chemo to do anything more than ball her eyes out from the horrible things coming out of his mouth. I don't care who you are, you will not speak to a woman, much less my mother, in that kind of way without me having something to say about it. He attacked me, placed his hands around my throat as to strangle me, only to have me remove his hands and hold him by the wrist just for him to try and pull back to I assume swing on me so we fell to the ground. He got up and called the cops saying I assaulted him (he's a cop btw) they could see he was clearly off his rocker but nevertheless we were given 2 hrs to pack our entire lives into my truck, trailer, sister car, fiance's car and be gone to the streets. Us 3 along with 11-3 week old English bulldogs (me and the fiance did breeding on the side). My family is gone now, I've since gone from a insane oxy/coke addiction of 10 years to now banging bth for the past 3..... She would be so heart broken to know where I'm at in life. My father ruined my finances as we were in business together (family owned construction company of 44 years) stole over 15k from me, tried to have me shut down with all material vendors as to cripple me from being able to work, shit talks me to no end, but he's still my dad and just bc I don't like him I will always love him. I just hate that I find myself wishing it was him gone and not her.... I feel awful to even type it and read it. I'm sorry for the vent post Fam.

By being put in the oven or microwave maybe?,"I’ve been ripped off several times now in my area with product that looks just like our usual good ECP, but it ends up having no opiate effects... just seems to make me tired / slightly drowsy like benadryl usually does.

I know everything’s cut with Dormin usually in my area. A lot of my dealers are too lazy to remove the red specs. Of course there may be many other cuts but I know of this one being the most prominent.

This totally sounds like I’m trying to whip up some fake dope and rip people off. I’m actually not. I would probably just be honest about that here. Actually been on subs for a while, but I use every few weeks for a couple days.

I’ve had 2 dealers that often sell good product sell me this garbage. When confronted, the main dude I go to was super honest about it being bunk (he blamed his boy for giving him fake shit unknowingly) and ended up hooking me up the next time (with good shit).

I’m just curious how it’s possible that this shit looks identical to ECP. I know a tan powder isn’t crazy but it’s seriously eerily similar. 

Talked to an ex-dealer from the area that I’m cool with when it happened and she said that they probably used Dormin and baked it in the oven. 

Idk though... I feel like it wouldn’t have looked like that. 

Thinking about it... I’ve actually had a third dealer dealer do the same thing but rock it back up and everything. Completely bunk but looked so fire lol.

My friend got basically robbed of .60 of some bth last week from this dude I used to go thru, back in my using days. She paid him for a G and he only gave her .40 and yes, she gave him the $ 1st without checking the weight.

As you all can imagine he's been ghosting her and stringing her along saying he's gonna make it right, blah, blah, blah.

Well guess who just came thru for her bigtime???
Moi!
I texted him telling him I'd buy a G from him if he added the .60 he owes her to it so basically giving him $80 for 1.60.

I just met him and he gets in my car and says there's only 1.40 but I'll get you the rest, I promise! Yeah, right m, fuckface, total bs. I then proceeded to tell him to just weigh out .60 cuz I'm not buying shit from him and to hurry up and weigh it out cuz I'm fuming, pissed he did that to her! He gets super agro and pissed off and is screaming at me saying fuck you, don't ever call me again, blah, blah, blah.

I drove away with around .55 so I'm super happy and very , very proud if myself! Just to add to the story, I've been on MMT for a little over 3 years now and don't use nor have I used since starting on methadone. Nice thing is, is that I wasn't even tempted to do any of the bth, at all so I'm super proud of that little victory as well!

I dedicate this post to all of us who've been fucked over, robbed, stolen from, lied to, strung along, etc, etc over the years, it's the small little victories that count once in awhile, right?

*Edit*:  Spelling, Grammer and basic shitshow of a post. I'm such a stickler for all of that but I guess I was so damn excited about the whole ordeal I couldn't wait to tell y'all!

*Edit* #2:  She just called me,to tell me that it's some of the best shit she's ever had and this girl has been in the game from a very, very long time.  So happy for her!

Not strictly opiate related, but I suppose I’ll be prescribing them so there’s the nexus to make it somewhat pertinent. 

The opportunity exists for me to take a medical student on a clinical placement in my practice. 

I’m somewhat ambivalent to the idea. On one hand, I’ll have someone who can talk to the patients, run out for coffees, is keen, uncorrupted & not yet jaded by life in general or the practice of medicine specifically. 

They’ll be in a couple of days a week & I’d be responsible for formulating a basic curriculum and providing some structure. 

Not simply a “sit there, shut up & watch what I do” thing. 

In some ways it’s a terrific opportunity to be involved in educating and arming the next generation of idealistic young doctors and preparing them to go forth into the world in their chosen profession. 

I do feel somewhat obligated because I’m just a link in the chain so to speak & feel a responsibility to pass on what I’ve learned & to mentor an unspoiled youngblood.

Plus I was in their shoes once and someone mentored & put up with my youthful exuberance & stupid, inane interrogatives. 

By the same token, I’m somewhat daunted that what if I fuck it up & they don’t really learn anything? 

Shit. 

I’m leaning towards just saying yes and accepting the placement. I do think it’s the right thing to do & I’m pretty sure it says somewhere in the Hippocratic oath about passing on knowledge. 

Then again, I’m pretty sure it also says I have to live a life of chastity and sacrifice a goat to a moon god or something. So yeah, whatevs. 

Given that my own kids ignore me, it might actually be nice to have someone who thinks I’m awesome and hangs off my every word, soaking up everything like a sponge. 

It’ll be a bit of extra work around the place, but what do my colleagues here, think? 

A noble & worthy opportunity to mould and shape a young, inquisitive mind?

Or a clusterfuck of epic proportions waiting to happen, that will devolve into the poor youngster watching me scream at the printer when it keeps telling me to clear the paper jam in tray 5 when I’ve already cleared that fucker out 9 times already this morning? 

TL/DR:

Do I accept a medical student for placement at my practice or is it not worth the hassle (or they’ll see how disorganised I am and how I keep losing pens etc)?

I have never got nauseous before as I usual take the codeine + promethazine together or sometimes take the prom 20 mins before .

I guess people react different ...

My advice never take your anti histamine after dropping ya opiate!!

a friend has stepped up and she will sell me 150mg of methadone for cheap. however, i don't see it being easy or worth smuggling that amount with me to this south american country (colombia). is it possible to bring this amount and do some kind of taper where i won't feel quite so horrible? it's not really enough methadone to do so, is it.

(6 days exactly) Yesterday I got a prescription for codeine cough syrup (10mg per 5ml) and I poured up the whole 100ml since my tolerance is pretty high. I wasn’t on oxy until the codeine high felt like it was gone. I waited probably 9 hours.  i didn’t feel high from the codeine anymore. 

That’s when I popped the 40, smoked a joint and came back in the house. Within an Hour, I started sweating like crazy, almost like i was in withdrawals, and i’ve never went through any withdrawals ever.  i’m just assuming that’s what a withdrawal feels like since I’ve seen people go through withdrawals. I started feeling really light headed and nauseous, and my heart kept on giving me pain. So i went to the washroom to force myself to puke, and i did. I felt better almost instantly. Idk what happened last night but i knew for a fact that i wasn’t okay at all. I just turned 19 and i don’t wanna die because of opiates...

My research has had varied results. I know 10/12 panels can include bupe. What about 9 panel?,"No one really cares and I know this isn’t the recovery subreddit. But damnit I love all of you and things are getting better.

I’m so stoked right now. My life is falling back into place after I’ve stopped feeling sorry for myself all the time. I’m finally starting to take the initiative to go out and make things better. Hard work is uncomfortable after getting so used to the instant gratification of getting high all the time.

I’m starting to remember the feelings that real success and accomplishments bring. It’s completely opposite of instant gratification. Instead of a temporary false sense of euphoria and comfort, you work hard for a long time and that success makes you feel whole and genuinely happy as a human. It’s a much better feeling knowing that you deserve the good feelings you have and that you worked for them.

So I’m 24 years old.

I didn’t score the ‘best’ job in the world but I finally have a solid job paying $15.50 / hour and $22.75 overtime. And this job leaves lots of room for moving up in the business and making it a career if it works out.

May not sound like a crazy amount of money. But I need to take what I can get right now. I’ve been a guitar teacher for years and that was really solid money per hour, but it was extremely inconsistent and unreliable. I also gave up most of that work after going to treatment this last time. It’s also been so hard to get what I had going again.

So I’ve been job hunting for a month or so.  
Just recently had 3 interviews and all of them led to an offer for a position.  
The first two were super low pay. $10.25 an hour  or $9.75... but I needed to take what I could get. It sucks because I have the skills to teach the guitar lessons and make up to $50 an hour; but that doesn’t translate to many other fields in terms of experience.

I’m done rambling... just so stoked. Another important thing is that my coworkers and the environment are super legit. In my opinion this has a HUGE impact on the job and honestly the quality of life in general. 

As long as I pass this 9 panel I’m good to go. Hopefully bupe doesn’t show up. I know I could use fake piss but I’d rather not have to deal with all of that.

I have plans to try the new sublocade injections and then taper off completely. Only when I’m ready. Right now it’s helping me tremendously so I’m in no rush to get off.

Sounds silly but I have plans to have my mother managing my finances; I need her to. I’m not  currently thinking about relapsing, but I don’t want to even risk it. I know how quickly things can go to shit.",1544726105.0

Supposedly this is a more efficient way to get high, get bigger rush or something like that. I am a bit skeptical, because by the time you draw blood again, the dope would be deep in your system already and even if it weren't, I don't see how would shooting it several times get you higher.

By all accounts my life has been good when I'm clean- I generally smile on a day to day basis and when I relapse I get into a state of desperation almost immediatly. I mean full blown fiend mode kicks in and I'm overdosing and suffering other severe consequences in a matter of days. It's really progressed to where my runs can not be longer than a week or two- and honestly I'm miserable the whole time. 

The thing is I struggle with coping with life- and opiates at some point used to relieve me with that duty. They do not do that anymore. They add depression and a heavy weight of addiction to whatever problems or feelings I may have. When I lost my baby recently I got high immediatly and was immeditately in a worst place than I was before. I got clean for a month after that and couldn't shake the sadness and did the same thing again. Went on a week run and destroyed a lot- ended up in a detox and have been clean for 1.5 months since then. 

I'm getting over the sadness slowly and I have my good and bad days- but I have a great job, great friends, I work a solid recovery program- I see that my life will clearly be pretty good if I don't get high. However, my loneliness and heartbreak since my girl left me (right after the baby thing) makes me want to get high. It doesn't make any sense- I've tried to deal with this problem by getting high and I have direct evidence that it does not work- but I hate feeling this way- and in my mind heroin fixes it. 

However lonely I am without her- heroin will isolate me even further- it causes me to ruminate on my problems, to lose hope, to tell myself I have a reason to get high because of the pain I'm in. It's a positive feedback loop that only increases the pain.

Pessimistic post for sure, but I've spoken to a lot of mates that use and the general idealisation they have is they're almost embracing an OD, and will inject, swallow, snort, with the mentality that an overdose is always on the cards but the care factor is zero - it's basically ""keep using and if something goes wrong, something goes wrong"".

Trying to figure out if using it around dose time is going to effect my oxycodone and how..... and really there is a lack of information online.

I know someone is going to say that it can make you have less of a chance in the off chance you have in the first place of your body converting oxycodone to oxymorphone 

To be honest I never tried oxymorphone and I’m sure that little automatic random conversion can explain why on occasion you get a nice feel that’s not always there but I will not base my decision on this.

I also think this a nice thread to have up and can benefit us and beyond to get this straight because I’m pretty sure I’m not the only one that needs to find this out 

So I have 5 slipped discs in my lumbar spine + a lot of other injuries and inflammation with my lower back, hip, got cut down in qty of pills and dose for the moment due to a error and just have to deal with that. Went from 90 7.5 hydro to 60 5mg and I’m not making it through till it can be fixed back which normally I’m fine with and it’s only a couple of weeks that I have to wait but

I’m pretty sure I may have broken my ankle yesterday and need to make thing stretch and don’t have a choice for the next 2 weeks 

My back actually hurts worse then my ankle but it’s starting to get hard to walk, yes you can walk on a broken ankle...at least I can and I have in the last...done it twice actually but that was when I was in middle school and not in my early 30’s. I more then know it’s a lot easier then vs now. Not that I’m old but not much is required then vs now.

TLDR - 

does cbd potentate oxycodone and othet opiates?

What is the effect that it has on them? Is it good, is it bad? 

I know it could effect the ability and off chance that your body can make its own oxymorphone but not much else and there’s not much available when searching 

Maybe have broken ankle on top of bad back and hip injuries and have to stretch for the next two weeks

I can care less about it, I want him to have a good time and I’m not going to have him sit there and watch me have all the fun. 

A couple hours into the night he claims he ‘lost’ his last hit so I give him another one to appease him. The nights coming to a close and I’ve saved one nice shot for the morning. As he’s heading to bed he takes my wallet (where I keep my stuff) and a couple other things off the table ‘so the dogs don’t get it’. I hear him fumble around at the table behind me and I start to get this sneaking suspicion that he took a little more from my bag. 

After he’s gone to his room to lay down, I check my wallet and wouldn’t you know it, 3/4 of my morning glory has suddenly disappeared. I’m sorry for bitching but it’s got me sitting here after doing over a g of dope in one night, not feeling all that great about the evening. 

I’m sure this has happened to a lot of you, anyone have any interesting stories about something similar? How would you guys handle the morning after? Rant over. Thx for listening.

Idk if anyone remember me posting some months back about my wife and I trying to get clean, wanted to tell y’all what happened.

We were using fent (was sold to us as oxy) and got very strung out. We weren’t paying bills, missing work, and neglecting our daughter. It was bad. 

On September 8th I picked up a sack of 10 and brought it home, we each did a few like normal. I smoked a bowl and went to bed. I woke up randomly at around 2:30 am to find my wife had overdosed. I did everything I could and called an ambulance but it was too late. She had kept doing them after I fell asleep. 

CPS put my daughter with my parents and I moved in with my sister. Since that day I have been sober. I have been going to 12 step meetings and a counselor to help deal with everything.

I’m now in my own place and back to work. I see my daughter every day or so and I still go to meetings. 

I share this with y’all not for pity or for some kind of woe is me post, but to warn of the dangers of this game. By all means if you can use responsibly and keep your shit together go for it but please be safe.

I also want to say if you are looking for a way out, there is one. Shit there are multiple ways to get out. You can do this, it’s not easy but can be done. I myself went straight cold turkey and was in an AA meeting the day after my wife died. Detox sucks I know but you can make it through.

Because you didn’t even try to fix them yet 

But you can fix them, just try it

Then try a little harder 

You are worth it 

You are loved 

Even though it doesn’t feel like it 

That’s the worst part, not feeling it 

But you have to know it 

Don’t let yourself fade away 

People out there want to know you 

Don’t let them miss out on what you have to offer 

Just you being present is one of the things you have to offer 

Thanks for being here

Do it some more tomorrow  ",1544655125.0

I don’t know how much deeper I can keep digging before I can’t take anymore. Why am I like this?,"New account, didn’t want to post on my regular.

I’m 24 and I’ve been using opiates for years. Last year in April / May I discovered snorting heroin and have been feeling trapped ever since.

I’m actually on subs now actually and have been for a few months but I still relapse every couple weeks for a couple days at a time. I was planning to get the sublocade injection and thought it would help.

All of this is besides the point though.

I am literally such a piece of shit and I have become everything I never wanted to be. Shortly after my last stint in rehab I was in an IOP.  It just finished a few weeks ago.

Basically I found my mom’s medicine and knowing that she doesn’t use it often (absolutely NO excuse) I took a total of 2 scripts of ambien (60 total) and probably like 100 hydros. I was taking a few pills everyday for weeks. When she didn’t find out I tried to justify it in my head. Well I thought I’d be ‘smart’ and replace the empty ambien bottles with Advil. My mom’s not stupid even though the shape is the same. 

Needless to say, she found out today. And instead of lying this time, I was completely honest. I’m such a piece of shit. 
What happened to me? Where did I start to go wrong? I’m seriously such a loser and I have nothing going for me... snooping in my parent’s room and stealing their medication. Talk about LOW. Fuck me.

Thanks for listening guys. I’m leaving my house now and going homeless for the first real time. Got layers of clothes, water, and a sleeping bag. So shitty. I was supposed to start a new job tomorrow too. Fucked that up because there’s no way my mom wants anything to do with me.

And also all my family already knows I’m a heroin addict. They thought I’ve been doing better but what my mom tells them is going to make me look like the junkie loser that I am.

Fuck this life. I’m pathetic. It’s like I’m so numb emotionally but all I can do is cry.

Maybe someone whose been in a similar position and has gotten better can help me out with some solid advice... any hope for me?",1544643929.0

So my friend came to me today and showed me his White Heroin which he ordered from Thailand (Deep web). He had a EZ test with him and we tested it and it was very very very pure ! 
He asked if I could hold it for him for a while because he is going away for vacation and doesn’t want it at his home. 

I’ve experience with opioids. I tried Codeine twice and also used oxycodone a handful of times this year. When I use Oxy I mostly need to take 30/40mg before feeling anything even with zero tolerance. Don’t now really why i need to take so much but lower dosage don’t do anything for me !

I am very interested in maybe trying Heroin but I am always concerned of ODing. I don’t want to die because of a stupid fucking drug so I want to take the safest way possible. I was planning to take a small key bump with the amount of match head and wait 30 min to maybe redose when needed. Is this safe to do this way ? 

EDIT: I am not going to try it ! Risk are way to high just to get high for 2/3 hours !! Fuck that shit ! Thanks for all the information reddit ! You saved my life !
