Now here’s the catch. My car is a piece of shit and my mother took the license plate and keys as it’s registered to her, but she said I could sell it. I’m wondering if some person would come by, tow this Honda Civic and give me about $500 for it.


I also have a Xbox One I don’t use with Fortnite which she would notice, but I have like $450 in citi reward on amazon, could always order another. (Best part for Amazon route is I can get same day shipping). And of course blame Amazon for “doubleing” the citi rewards.


And third option is I purchased the newest Wireless Beats 3 from Amazon with the Citi card bonus points. If she doesn’t loan me today (which she might give me some money), I wanted to get at least 20 xans and 2 bundles or $240. I have $37 in my checking, $9.10 on my H&R Emerald Card (wish I knew how to transfer that to my bank), or I could just use the Emerald Card for two packs of Newport 100 with the remaining amount on my credit card.


If my mother didn’t get a text from every damn purchase I made with the credit card, I’d be buying 4 Dewalt drills and putting them on OfferUp. I also tried to get a cash advance with this credit card but I think there was a 4 digit pin to use it, and when you call the # on the back I think a username/number was required or some shit.


Edit: Still waiting on $92 from my states tax return, they quote

but, this time is different. i think my downfall is steady supply and working enough to be able to abuse drugs at first. ive been in a good way for a while. a lot of steps forward, i actually have money saved and more importantly have my priorities in order. do i still procrastinate within those priorities? of course. hence the other side of the issue.

(Long),"So about 8 years ago about a year after I started using I agreed to go to an outpatient group twice a week to please my family and I met this guy that I’ll call Mark, who introduced to me to first solid dope connect. Mark and I became pretty good friends over the years. I knew he had a brother but I’d only met him a couple times and never really paid him much attention. Fast forward to last summer and I pull up to Marks house after getting high and hanging out with him to see his brother standing outside. The sun was just starting to set and as I got out of the car his brother, who I’ll refer to as Keith, smiled at me with the most beautiful teeth (I’m a sucker for a gorgeous smile) and these crystal blue eyes, the sun hit him just right and it was like seeing my dream man fabricated right before my eyes. Perfect height (I’m 4’ 9” he’s 5’7”), blue eyes, light hair, amazing smile, sculpted body (he was a personal trainer at one time). He had a job, a place to stay, and seemed like everything I was looking for in a man. Also, like me, a heroin addict.

We spent every day together for the next 3 weeks getting high and hanging out, although it never got sexual even though I desperately wanted it to, until disaster struck. We were both on probation, him for OUI for nodding off at the wheel and crashing and me for possession, Class A. Neither of us had been on top of our stipulations such as passing drug tests and his probation officer issued a warrant for his arrest. As they were taking him away I wrapped my fingers around the fenced in window of the cruiser and told him I loved him. And I meant it. His eyes nearly exploded from his head. He spent the weekend in county and when I went to court on Monday to see him I found out I too had a warrant. Not being the first time I figured I’d see the judge and get a new date. Boy was I wrong. I end up being detained and next thing I know I’m sitting across from this man in my own cage in the basement of the court house. I go back in front of the judge after trying and failing to prove my sobriety with another drug screen and I am told I will be detained for 30 days in county until my next court date. Cue me loosing my fucking mind. I’ve never been to jail. Ever. 

They bring me back down to the basement lock up and in hysterics I tell Keith that I’m sorry and that I’ll see him in a month. We yelled back and forth to each other until I was taken away. Before I left I yelled to him that I loved him and from the other side of the room where I couldn’t even see his face, he yelled back that he loved me too. 

I spent the next 30 days kicking a $80/day heroin habit, 16mg/day suboxone, and 10mg/day xanax. Keith and I spoke every day. He always answered and talked to me for the whole half hour I was allowed. He put money on my books for canteen. We decided we would be together and that we would use the first day we hung out as our anniversary. Even though I was in jail I felt like one of the luckiest girls in the world. He was so kind to me. Made me feel so fucking special. No man had ever treated me this way. He even wrote me letters and sent me a picture to ease my heartache. I didn’t sleep more than a couple hours those first 30 days but he got me through it. I don’t know what I would have done in there without him. 

My court day finally came and I ended up being sentenced to 59 days for violations of probation. So I had 3 more weeks to spend before I could go home. I got some good time for getting a job on the unit before I was sentenced so I only served 52 days. 

Like I said we hadn’t slept together before I went away so I was really looking forward to it when I got out and it was worth the wait. I won’t go into detail but it was amazing. The first few weeks I was home were bliss. He was just as loving and attentive in person as he’d been on the phone. I’d never been happier. 

So obviously I had to fuck it up. 

Instead of taking the same offer they gave me of 59 day jail time he opted for an ankle bracelet, a breathalyser he has to do 3-4 times a day and 9 more months of probation including night drug classes twice a week and an $800 OUI class. He got clean and went on the vivitrol shot before I got out after I begged him to promising I would get on it too when I got out. 

I opted for another type of shot when I couldn’t get the vivitrol right away. My dope habit was right back to where it was before jail. Slowly over the last few months our relationship has changed. He’s not loving at attentive as he once was. We hardly have sex anymore and he seems disinterested in anything I say or do. I know it’s my own doing and I hate myself for it. 

At the end of next month he’ll be off probation and everything that’s come with it. I feel like a huge piece of shit because I know as soon as he has the ability to get high without having the courts breathing down his neck I know he will and I can’t fucking wait. I feel like once he starts getting high again our relationship will get better because he won’t resent me for getting high when he can’t. I know I’m a horrible person for feeling this way but I just want things to go back to the way they were. I miss the way he used to act toward me.

As I mentioned in a couple other post, something changed in me recently when i got off h onto subs. it was a very wierd wd process that took almost 10 days to actually start taking subs.

but anyways, life is great no urge for opiates at all. I don't miss them, i don't want them, I've been tested by people several times with no problems.

but I've been in a lot of pain over the last few days... how tf am I going to do this? I can't live my life in this pain. and I definitely can't work like this, which I start Monday.

I feel really down right now. I feel like i had this beautiful balloon floating above me and some one just came and popped it.

on top of the mental, and physical part, i have type 1 diabetes. every time I'm in pain like this my blood sugar goes into the 300's and 400's.

Is this just an inevitable effect of using something so pleasurable that the payback is suffering and feeling like shit naturally?

On the flip side taking naltrexone daily has a side effect of feeling amazing when it wears off with full of energy.. I'm thinking of taking naltrexone daily now for a month hoping a oxy 30 will have me super lit lol and limiting to weekend use again if I ever get back to it",1520052989.0

Normally, 50-60mg of oxy (oral) get me where I want to be. I have heard mixed things about opanas though. I have seen mixed/varying opinions on dosage equivalency. 

Also, I am aware that the best ROA would be insufflation. (No IV for me) How would I go about removing the ER function? I read that simply crushing the pill would work, while others have said to “shave” or “lick off” the outer coating.

To me a recovering heroin addict when I first got sober I somewhat bought the disease argument, as I've spent more time I can't think of it as an incurable disease. I personally believe it's a grey area, the mind creates a very strong mental and physical craving for the drugs and an unwillingness to face the withdrawal symptoms and you can see why people getting addicted to substances for long times.

However, my biggest concern about the disease diagnosis is that a lot of addicts I've met create a label in there head. They create a belief that they have this incurable disease and this belief becomes almost subconscious; becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy.

In my personal story, I always dislikes the diagnosis that I had a helpless malady. So the label never stuck. Since I've been clean of heroin 2 years  I've done othe drugs even percocets and have drank occasionally, but now the gaps between my using have gotten longer and longer.

I bought some percs from a close friend and took them, but I absolutely hated the way they made me feel. Dizzy, light-headed, drowsy, etc. Fast forward a few months and I meet a guy in my class who is selling 40mg OC Oxycontin for FOUR DOLLARS A PILL. I found this too good to be true, so I bought one and swallowed it and I had the most euphoric experience of my life. This was strange to me because I hated percs, but I loved how Oxycontin made me feel. I've always been fascinated by drugs because my birth parents were both coke and heroin addicts. I was adopted at the age of 1 and I lived with my adoptive parents my entire childhood. 

After this fantastic experience, I started buying quite a bit of oxy. I would only do it once a week at first, but inevitably it progressed and soon I was doing it three times a week. I was snorting 80mg of oxy in the bathroom at my high school at least weekly, as well as doing it spread out throughout the week. However, I never let myself get physically addicted to it because I knew how bad the withdrawals would be. 

I believe that I started using out of curiosity, but also because I knew that it would help me cope with my mental disorders. I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder, social anxiety, as well as OCD. Of course opiates helped because they make you feel wrapped in a warm blanket free of troubles and worries. After a few months though, my plug got caught stealing these pills from his dad (fucked up, I know). So I stopped doing opiates regularly but my tolerance remained generally the same. Over the past four years I've taken a multitude of opioids but they've all been spread out. I am 18 now and I still have to rail at least 80mg to get an actual ""nod"". 

Thankfully, I've made it a point to not seek out opiates but I get incredibly intense cravings from time to time that send me into a deep depression. I feel as though, during these times, that opiates are the only thing will ever make me truly happy. I know that I shouldn't get back into them because they will fuck up everything in my life but when this feeling comes it stays for a long time. So now I come to the point of my post.

1. How do you deal with intense mental addiction to opiates?
2. Why do you think that I have such a naturally high tolerance to opiates? I've never felt any nausea from taking any opiate at any dose, even fentanyl. Even when I took an OC 40 for the first time all I felt was pure bliss.
3. Do you think I could constrain myself to doing it only monthly or so and not fall back into my habit? I did it once, but I don't know what would happen if I tried again.

What's the explanation behind it? Knowing that opioids cause respiratory depression and how some research claim they can affect immune cells function, increase histamine release causing bronchospasm, vaso-constriction and hypersensitivity reactions.

How to know when you're ""in the clear""?","I'll begin this by saying I'm pretty sure I'm worrying for nothing lol-- I've been awake for going on 38+ hours now and that alone tends to trigger my PTSD symptoms something awful. Not to mention having a few other anxious situations happen over the day. Anyways I'll get to it...

I got a handful of oxycodone 30s last night. My tolerance always starts at 15mg every 4 hours or so unless of course I spent the previous day getting high as well. Anywho, I've been clean a good few months, so I started out this morning at 8:30 am with my 15mg. Usually I don't take more than 45mg in a twelve hour period. However the first dose didn't seem to give me much of a high so around 10 am I popped the second half, giving me a total of 30mg in my system. At 2:30, popped another 15mgs. Then around 6pm I had the second half of that, giving me a total 60mgs in my system between the hours of 8:30am until now (it's 10:35pm my time)

I can tell you that I have no idea why I decided to pop that last 15. I actually don't even remember the exact time when I did, though it wasn't any later than 6:30, of that I'm sure. I also only vaguely remember eating that last half, but I know I did.

I was doing alright up until around 8 pm when the nod-out effects began. Did some chores, had a mini-freak out over the discovery of a minor health issue with my dog, dealt with that accordingly, had a quick dinner and have been chilling in bed for about an hour.

I've had this happen a few times where I psyched myself out in thinking I might have overdosed, so I suppose I'm curious-- and obviously, definitely would like to know any important info about whether I may actually OD in the future-- to how I can figure out whether or not I should seek medical attention. A lot of it honestly is my lack of health insurance and the horrible stress it'd add to everything else if I had hospital bills to deal with as well.

I was reading through another post here (probably some ancient thread tbh) and a commenter said he wouldn't be able to write anything remotely coherent if he'd taken 'too much'-- and if he tried he'd nod out so much that one sentence would take him 45 minutes to finish lol. Hopefully this is coherent, and I've only had a couple moments where closing my eyes sounded suuuper great right now haha.

Anyways. I'll wrap this up by admitting that if I'm gonna fuck around with these meds, I can't *fuck around* with these meds, you know. I promise I'm not as foolish as my actions in regards to taking more than necessary today shows I am. If anything, y'all let me know whether that last sentence makes any damn sense at all? Haha.

A dumbass 👍",1520135339.0

I didn't IV it though I snorted it lol so of course that makes it all OK now smh......well anyway I'm still an addict, and can't get into a rehab till third week of March. Smh so I have to wait before anywhere has a bed open to get in. 

So next week or so I'll have to go back to the detox place for the week so I can get in to the rehab and go right from the detox so I wouldn't be stuck going back to the streets and having any temptations ruin my start of sobriety.

I got home from detox yesterday and within 5 hours was on the street living again. Went to the local salvation army shelter right now..got dome dinner atleast and s bed for he night..praying I can keep this together till this rehab has an open bed for me.

Rapid taper with the subs over the course of a week and a bit until I can jump off without any withdrawal symptoms or only minor ones. After this start with the naltrexone at a low dose.

I broke it into 4 total pieces and took 1mg sublingually, 1mg IV (I know that’s stupid but oh well) and 2mg intranasily via water.  I think i fucked up the under the tongue one cause I can’t seem to make that roa work. The IV method was painless but unremarkable. The intranasal method I did by pulling up water into a syringe with sub in it and then shaking until it’s dissolved, and then removing the needle and pushing drops of water up so it fills the little lip around the edge and snorting that, repeating until it’s gone. I felt the taste in my nose so I know it got to the membranes. But I feel nothing. Nothing except very irritable as of right now. Everyone’s everything is pissing me off. Is that from the bupe crowding out natural endorphin binding? I’m not annoyed that the bupe isn’t making me feel good, I wasn’t expecting much from it but am I doing it wrong? Or did I do it right and the irritability is normal? I hadn’t taken a full agonist in probably 48 hours though I had taken what was supposed to be tramadol the two days before, but I got literally nothing out of them so I think they were fakes. They were generics from India that have had no effect every time I’ve taken them. So any suggestions? I only took a small amount cause I know that is usually better with subs. ",1520111927.0

EDIT: the only use for (TOP) is serious opioid addiction. Not like hydrocodome from the dentist. There are many alkaloids in opium.

EDIT. TOP is not suitable to replace short term painkillers because of its components long half lives. some of those componemts prevent overdoses like one which imduces vomiting at high doses. Its just so much safer and cheaper for USA.

Since I didn't shoot it, or go out and buy dope.


Shit's been rather good since I got clean, almost shocked at how fast my life has turned around in a month. After getting laid off, I now make far more money then I ever did at that job, and it's all tax free (but legit, I'm supposed to pay taxes eventually). 


No I am not a stripper. My dick is too small, and my tits are too big.


But on that same note, I've lost over 15 pound in the last month, about 30 over 4 months. I always, lose weight when I get off dope, and always balloon when I get on it.


That being also said, hopefully my body will be beach sexy in a month (or at least above ground pool sexy). Since I'm going to [redacted] country on a vacation, to which I actually am able to pay for (holy fuck). I learned that prositution is basically legal, I never knew how many countries either had it legal, or didn't care, in the Americas (and well pretty much everywhere, IDK how I fell into this prostitution rabbit hole, I liteerally have more interest in the law aspect of it, then actually....you know,  hoho!

No that isn't my primary reason to go there, I wanted to see monkeys, that was my reasoning. Then I learned this after the fact....hey quit looking at me like that. I was absolutly not planning on having sex with the monkeys. Dammit, I should just stop tying, o well too late. backspace is broken because I said it is.

I never thought in my life i'd be able to afford another trip. But hotel's been paid for, visa is in order, tickets almost bought. So expect some cool pics around my 60 day update!

1 guess per person, don't be a dick and make multiple accounts. It's just for fun, and only 5 bucks, come on don't be a dick.

**rule addenmun edit:**

So to put a sense of urgency, and add more fun, I decided to put a dead line, let's say exactly 1pm, eastern standard time, you win! I had in my head 3 countries I'd go to (in case no one guessed it, maybe should have mentioned that, but o well lol) New Zealand.  So someone is going to win, or I can send you fent test kits, I got a pack of 10 coming, I will send 5 or 5 dollars 

hell I may do 2 prizes, not sure yet, depends if the strips come in, I aint rich! one 5 dollar, one 5 pack of fent strips in bit coin, your choice if you win, runner up gets the other (fent strips havn't got here yet, so if they do not come in a reasonable amount of time, should be today, $5 with default, offer valid in 194 counties, not valid in DPRK, unless you got monies.)


Also, if no one get it by midnight tonight, eastern time, you can guess again before 1PM. :) Why am I doing this?! I'm just fucking bonkers today, this is cool by the mods right?


if this works out, I'll do more fent strip give aways and btc give away in the future (nothing insane, like no more then 5 dollars, or I may just order a ton of fent strips and do that).  The fent epidemic is something I'm completely unfamiliar about, we don't really see fent down here, but I've met people personally effected by it. So it scares the shizzle outta me. I think one of the steps is servicework? Consider this kinda that?


**CONTEST OVER, WE HAVE A WEINER**: u/achemicaIreaction claim yo prize foo! Stand by u/drugstorecowbro for a second prize in time, or if he doesn't give me a response in a day. I'll be staying a block away from Trumps Silver Weiner overlooking the Pacific!

When it's up to me, I'll always grab hydromorph contins - the big capsules full of tiny beads - and crush and snort them. I'm not a needle person, so the intranasal way has always worked fine for me. However, I recently got my hands on some low mg hydromorphone pills (I guess they're dilaudid), 4 and 5mgs. 

The first time I had them a couple of months ago, I tried to snort one but it's just too much powder compared to the little crushed beads I'm used to. So I ended up just eating most of them (not all at once lol, just over the course of the week or whatever), and like, it sort of worked, but I was munching them every couple of hours and was just sort of ""well"" as opposed to high. 

Anyways, so this time I got the 4mg dilaudid again, and both yesterday and today I plugged 3 of them when I got up. This morning I plugged the 3 and then was able to lie on my bed for 10 or so minutes while I waited, and I actually felt that wonderful, warm opiate come-up buzz! I used to get that nice come-up feeling when taking percocets when I was younger, and that feeling is probably what attracted me to opiates in the first place. I didn't even think I could get that feeling anymore, so it was quite a pleasant surprise! 

Anyways, I made an alt account just to share this because I had to tell someone. So if anyone out there is considering plugging but is feeling deterred by the idea of putting something in your butt, I'm just here to vouch for it.

A good, ""trusted"" dealer gave them to me (market price too) giving me the story they came from a friend who had a pharmacy connection.  He's been a great dealer for about bhalf a year now, btw.  But with Percs.  His source dried up (thanks Sessions) and this new contact came in.  He reassured me 100% trustable.  But you know how that is.

Anyway, I didn't have strips to test, so sampled a half of a quarter of a 30 mg pill (like 4 mgs).  It hit almost immediately, but didn't have any euphoric effect.  Still felt something lacking in my gut.  But did something, felt intense...but like a downer with intent.  Every fiber of me felt it.  It stopped the cravings in my gut for an hour or two.  I have no idea how to describe it other than it temp. shut down dope cravings and sort of felt good for an hour?  Then felt ""heavy"" and non-euphoric but was doing something and that lasted another few to four hours.

So the next day I did a quarter (7 to 8 mgs).  Same but more intense.  At this point I thought it was all in my head since I was used to Percosets and Morphine.  Maybe it was a brand switch?  But Oxys are supposed to be amazing, and they are dereived from same dope. Right?

Next day I did half a 30mg pill.  All day (7 hrs), I had the feeling I was still going through withdrawls from my previous Persoset supply being cut short (tapered off to 7 mgs a day though) and thought the Roxys would totally help, but they weren't, but I was feeling super intense and focused, but off at the same time. Which sucked as I was in an important biz mtg.  I tried to sleep as I felt insanely tired, but could not slow myself down for a nap.  Weird.

So the withdrawls continued to claw at my gut today, but I felt this heavy feeling again when I took a quarter of the A-215s.  So I texted my friend to see what was up with him.  My friend who went in on the buy says the same.  We both do believe they aren't Roxys.  We met tonight and discussed it for a few hours and we think it's not just in our heads.  But damn they seem/look legit, and this dealer is too.  If not Fent, what other crap can they be pressed with?  What have we been taking?  Hopefully not Fent + benzos + Adderall or something.  All hard to get off of.  But hey, look where I'm posting.

They look perfect.  Good speckling, cut in half...the right color inside.  They taste bitter when you lick them (but not overwhelming).

They only strange thing is when you cut them with a knife, they are rock hard.  Seems weird. Takes some muscle to cut them into fourths.  Is that normal?  Part of me thinks we found someone really good at the pill press with Adderal mixed with Xanax or baby power or something with a dash of Fent. 

Testing a pill for Fent tomorrow (my friend is picking up strips).  Fuck this.  The whole three days I've been in withdrawls despite.  Only tonight took 7mgs of Morphine and SUDDENLY felt relief.  Roxys these are not.

823xs8,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/823xs8/bupetolerancedph_question/,2,https://redd.it/823xs8,AbanoR,Bupe/Tolerance/DPH question,"So I took my usual weekly hydrocodone and the usual potentiators (including DXM, Tagamet etc...), plus my IV benadryl. (I don’t need anyone telling me that that is dumb, I’ve heard it all already). 

IVing the Dph has in the past always created a more intense experience since it comes on so much quicker. I also crush and dissolve the hydro in water so it hits quicker as well. I usually do 50mg of dph though, this time I did 100mg. I’ve always enjoyed the sedation from that amount, even by itself though I don’t do that often. 

I didn’t get the feeling I had come to expect AT ALL and it was a dramatic change from previous experiences. I felt good for sure but it wasn’t anything like in the past, and I’d gotten pretty consistent results with my weekly ritual for at least a month and a half. Now, I have used some oxy I managed to get ahold of and extra lortabs over the past 2~3 weeks when normally I limit myself to Sunday night. I also took a sub yesterday at around noon (4mg). 

So my question is this, did I not get as high as I had come to expect:
1) Simply because of tolerance? Doing to much other stuff outside of my weekly indulgence? I wasn’t popping pills all day mind you, I just got high a few more times over those weeks than normal. Maybe two or three times a week. 

2) Because I took to much dph maybe? If there’s a sweet spot maybe I overshot it? I always figured that the more dph the stronger the opiate high but I guess there could be a point where it out muscles the opiates euphoria in favor of sedation. 

3) Or because the sub I took Saturday was still in my system and blocked some of the effects? I was told to wait 24-36 hours which I did but this still happened.  I took it several different ways only a small amount at a time because I was unfamiliar with it and because I just couldn’t seem to make the sublingual method work. 

It’s frustrating me because I have limited access to my DOC and not getting what I had come to expect is a real bummer. I know tolerance is a bitch, but I’m hoping y’all might be able to tell me if there is another reason, one that I could easily fix. Mind you, this wasn’t just a little less of a high, this almost felt like nothing and only lasted maybe an hour. My usual routine (which I’ll post below), used to have me floating on cloud nine and you’ll notice that it’s a little weaker than what I did tonight. 

30-45~ minutes prior to opiates
75mg hydroxizine pamoate
25mg diphenhydramine 
1000mg Tagamet
1 naproxen sodium
1 big swig of DXM
Big glass of grapefruit juice and tonic water

With opiates: 50mg of hydrocodone. 
25mg hydroxizine pamoate
50~mg diphenhydramine IV
200mg Tagamet
1000mg of calcium carbonate
1 big swig of DXM. 

Next time I think I’m gonna do this down to a T after a little tolerance break and compare results but for now I’d love some input on what might be the problem. ",1520230743.0

I have been collecting all of my medicine since i was 12.
When i was 12 my parents explained to me that the expiration dates on the medicine bottles of pills that are pressed mean absolutely nothing.
8 years later, when i am 20, i research this myself and find out that it is true

fast forward another 10 years

and i have saved every single medication since i was 12

So i have a lot of codeine, antibiotics, and a few other things (promethazine, benzos, allegra, prednisone, 5 cases of prescription ear drops, eye drops, low-doseage codeine,  and a few other things that are escaping my mind)

. I would be ok for a few months . Medication would be valuable in an apocalyptic scenario .

This is something that repeats over and over again in my head:
I dont wanna be sober if an apocalyptic , zombie, world-war, scenario occurred. so to speak. 

in theory it would actually be better to lay low highly medicated without moving therefore going undected . 

If you did not have your pharmaceuticals available before the scenario you wouldmost  ikely have less than 12 hours.

During the Blackout of 77 in New York City all of the stores were looted within a hour . People of the highest social standing were reduced to looters. Most people were looting things they needed. Others were doing it for fun. The hospital was over run with injuries from broken glass. Yet, not 1 body was found, despite gunshots being fired all night long, and the city being torn to pieces. Kids would also light buildings on fire for fun .

And dose for dose ratio it’s 1:1 hydrocodone:morphine oral, however morphine only has a bioavailability of *about* 30% orally? So technically 30mg of morphine should roughly be 10mg of hydrocodone? hydro’s bioavailability is roughly 87% quite like Oxycodone, however oxycodone is x1.67 stronger than Hydrocodone I believe according to equi-analgesia chart. 

So I’m theory considering strength and bioavailability it’d seems morphine is the weakest orally dosage wise of them all?

But I gotta share a lil story cause I'm high rn and honestly didn't think it would happen today.
So let's back up. 
I lost my biggest flow of income recently and was not prepared. My girl and I are gonna be going into wds no matter what pretty much but damn dog I wanted to prepare a little.

 So day before yesterday I got a half on credit from my main dude but I know full well I can't pay his ass back.
I'm riding the bus home and I see this dude and I just know, (you know when you know), that he fucks with opiates.
Young black dude, thuggish, got one eye, big ass pores, but he's doing alright,  decent clothes jewelry. 
He's in the seat in front of me so I pull out my phone and lean over and call my banks automated system, 
it's a robot bish named Maggie and her only job in the world is to remind me how broke I am. 
So I say,""yo can you talk?"" That's all Maggie does is talk, ""press # for more options you broke ass mafk"", she says.
""Aight"", I say, ""you talk to Keisha?, well shit you better. Old boy paid in full for them fingers."" (Now I got the dude in front of me's attention. )
 ""Aight og"", I say and hang up. 
Few seconds later the dude leans over, ""ay I know you fuck with that food, make a nigga some money."" 
I was like ""bet, gimme yo number""
Flash forward to today and I'm sick af and after all day all I can manage to get up is $16 I'm like fuck... so I call old boy and a woman answers.
She says ""she's his ex and they ain't together anymore.""
I'm like fuck, so after awhile, like 3 hrs later I'm thinking fuck it, I'm gonna try to cold cop wit $16 and I start walking toward the cheapest gas station in the hood. 15mins in to walking I get a call and it's the dude, he called his ex asking if I called for him.
He was right down the street pulled up in 20 mins and sold me a twamp (.2) for $16.
It's fenty forsure but I'm not complain for how little I got, we ain't sick that's fosho.

A fun way to divert resources away from dope.,"#Note: Scroll down to the long horizontal line and bold text that says ""Start here"" if you don't want to read a whole bunch of background info to build up to the point of this post.

&nbsp;

Last two times I was at Cliff's house were a couple of days ago. The first was to watch SVU and Waco and that did generate my previous and most recent Cliffpost. Secondly was to help him buy subs. For once he actually wanted to buy subs in a timely manner but his sub connects suck or barely exist so of course I was requested to accomplish this mission through my contacts.


&nbsp;

My contact was originally going to come to me but due to rain and hunger they opted to go to the local fast food joint. It was pouring rain outside so the connect offered me one extra sub for biking over. Cliff paid for four subs and agreed to give me one. Of course I didn't tell him about the fifth free sub so I pocketed that as well. All-in-all, I did pretty well for myself.

&nbsp;

That night stuck around after delivery I stuck around Cliff's for all of thirty minutes. During that time we glossed over a couple of topics. For one, he shared a story about his attempted trade/transaction with our neighbors. One of them being the hardcore benzo enthusiast who wanted to trade three blues for many xannies. Cliff didn't want to trade, he proffered cash to buy a bundle of dope. The benzo enthusiast wanted $25 when he paid $20 and he felt that he deserved to make a little money off of each. With Cliff, he wanted two for $5 on the benzos when fair market value could easily reel in more cash per pill. 


Moff, the benzo enthusiast argued that Cliff didn't pay a lot for the benzos so he shouldn't charge as much. Okay fair enough, Moff always wants top dollar for shit but always wants to low ball. Just about every selfish actor in trade.

&nbsp;

Tom, not to be mistaken with Tim lives nearby as well and is often the middleman for Cliff. Tom is the one who ratted me out indirectly for doing dope. The true details are murky and will never be fully known but when I was told that my brother was coming over to ""talk about something very important"" on a particular Saturday, I had a hunch what it was about. Once I had a hunch on what it was about, it wasn't very hard to guess the source of the leak.


Months later, Tom apologized to me for being the source of the leak. He said, ""I was talking to my mom and my brother must've overheard...""


WTF, why the fuck does he think it's cool to talk about my dope habit and my need to purchase suboxone before a trip with his mom. He probably told his brother directly, but if he did only tell his mom.. she has a big mouth as well so I'm lucky the info didn't spread with more virility. In conclusion, I believe Tom spoke about my activities in order to soften the negative impact of his mother knowing about his own activity. ""Look, Sloany does this shit too and he's a bright fella."" After the fact I told this mofo, like WTF... I don't tell my family that you do dope and smoke crack. As far as they're concerned you're a professional in whatever you do. Well, in reality I used to say that. I stopped covering and started slandering his good name in front of my immediate family after the information leak as part of my damage control.


&nbsp;

After the info leak, my brother came over to have the talk and stage the intervention. The first question aside from how I was doing, of course it was the master inquiry. Am I doing dope? Where the fuck did you hear that from? Around the neighborhood you say? 


I love when someone rats you out or accuses you of something and nobody will tell you who. Like when I was kid in school and someone ratted me out for throwing food across the cafeteria or some other shit. Later on in life when I hear the saying, ""you have the right to face your accuser"", I think back to all the times I could've quoted that phrase when I was kid. Of course, the schools are like mini dictatorships. As for family interaction, I don't know why I can't be told who the fuck the source of the information leak is. Perhaps this is to make it more challenging for me to cover my tracks? It's not like I'm going to go beat the shit out of a friend who contacted my brother out of concern for my well being. 


&nbsp;


So anyway, a few months ago we have this talk in the family room due to an information leak. Aside from asking whether I was doing dope, my sibling also said, ""I was told that you tried to sneak Suboxone on to an airplane."" I truthfully stated, I did not *try* to sneak Suboxone on to a plane. I also attested to the fact that I went through a full body scan and physical frisking. Since I had a hunch of who made the information leak, I made up a story about a weed transaction gone awry and spoke about how Tom is in fact a crackhead. Crack is the worst (exaggeration) and people who do crack and heroin are even worse. **Would you trust the word of a crackhead-heroin addict?** Apologies to anybody who likes Crack and Dope who is reading, but this did prove effective as a means to draw suspicion away from myself.


In the end of that discussion, my brother was sufficiently satisfied as was my father after a urine test. Yes, many of us know that urine tests can be thrown and this proved effective in this instance.


&nbsp;

#Start here if you don't care for the background info:

**During that intervention, before I sufficiently convinced the inquisition that I was not consuming dope, my brother stated, ""so, there is a detox period."" To which I responding, ""which is entirely unnecessary since I have nothing to detox from!""**


Fast forward to two days ago, I'm sitting at Cliff's kitchen table as he's prepping himself a line. I took a portion of a sub that day as I did for the days prior, the topic of cessation came up. I referenced the time I had that mini-intervention and how my brother referenced the ""detox period."" Cliff made light of addiction by saying that I needed detox as much as he didn't need Jenny Craig (he's a fat bastard). He argued that I by no means needed to detox, supposing that I wouldn't go through too much Withdrawal, if any whenever I stopped using dope.

&nbsp;

I felt like I was being told the sky is not blue. I know that I can at least experience withdrawal symptoms that last a solid three days. After the worst of it things smooth out but it still isn't the easiest week. This is why it's easy for someone to be drawn back to using dope once they have the means to get dope after seven days of nothing. If I wasn't addicted, I wouldn't be going out of my way to get Suboxone before getting dope-sick. 


It's like he sees the writing on the wall, that I'm not super committed to spending a bunch of money on dope this coming pay day. I've hinted many ways by indicating that there is no certainty that I'll buy dope this coming pay day. I still told him regardless of what I do, I'll still pick up his roxy script this week if time permits.",1520205927.0

*Paging purresident meff experts - /u/nosecandiez and /u/spinderella69 -- Please bless me with your knowledge.*

So I'm doing my once a pay period chip today...

I have my shitty heroin where .4 will barely get me where I want to be and I also have what wassupposedto be a gram of coke.

But, as you can probably guess, it fucking isn't.

It' a gram of what is obviously shitty meth. It smells like chemicals and tastes like ass. Now, because drug dealers don't exactly have a return policy I'm stuck with this shit.

I did a matchstick head sized bump as, I suppose, a test... And, okay, aside from the shaking hands and the fact I'm worried my overweight heart might explode *(I'm joking... more or less)* I'm okay doing this.

So, I guess my questions are as follows...

I'm obviously going to bang this shit, because, well, it's what I do. How much is an acceptable/safe amount to do based on my zero tolerance and the above report of the match-head bump?/

How many shots should I get out oh the just under a gram I have left?

Do I need to add heat to break it down in a spoon? For that matter is there anything special I need to know about banging da meff?

I'm saving the heroin for either the last shot, all nice and goofball-y, or as landing gear for when the well runs dry. Which is the better plan?

Lastly, how long between shots should I wait? I imagine it's gonna be fiend-y as fuck, so I'm hoping if I can make a scjedule  that'll help.

That's it ya'll.

There has been a couple very weird batches going around. I've gotten some like this, other ppl in my state. And my friend in the next state over.. Called me frantic the other night when he got something similar. 

I was buying fent off this dude for the past year. It was always white as snow, powder and clear in the rig. And it was fent for sure, as I tested it. Plus I always got pinned out, really warm, and super noddy. Well my plug was dry for half a day then picked up more. Now he always got the same thing. But everytime he reupped, I always did a tester shot first. Just because its fent i'm dealing with, and just incase something was not cut as much and too strong. Well thank fucking god I did because I prob would've died. 

I mixed the shot up, drew it up and only shot a tiny bit. Im talking like 5 units. All of a sudden, my heart started racing really fast. I was like ""ugh, great wtf is this""? Tried to be calm and not freak out totally, as this would make it worse. Then my heart started POUNDING. Wicked uncomfortably. Now I love shooting coke and speedballs. This was NOTHING like that at all. It was such a yucky feeling and just didnt feel right at all. I wouldn't have even thought there was any fent in it at all, besides the fact I was wicked sick before I did it.. But I got off E at least. It started to subside a little over time. But I still felt shaky and uppidy for a while after. 

There was another time something almost identical happened to me over this past summer. Bought it off one of my other dealers. But it was the same looking white powder. That time, the feeling came and went with the rush. Didn't linger for hours like this recent time. But that time, it made my pupils HUGE like I was rolling.

Ive shot dope/fent, coke, crack, ketamine, and molly before. And this weird ""fent"" or whatever the fuck it was.. Felt NOTHING like any of the other drugs Ive tried before. Has anyone else ever had stuff like this? 



TLDR; Was buying the same fent off this dude for almost a year. Got what was supposed to be fent, the same usual stuff I been doing (white powder, clear in the rig). But when I shot it, my heart started racing then pounding. Was mad jittery for like 2hrs after the shot. Out of 2 sketchy times this happened, one time my pupils turned to saucers. Has anyone else got shit like this recently?",1520197298.0

I spent my hotel money for the day on getting my puppers from the pound. Spoiled him and his mammy then got me high with the rest. 

Last time I actually lived outside I had a boyfriend by my side, my puppers, and was an unattractive lardass. I had no worries. I'd be lying if I didn't say being a skinny 'attractive' single female alone doing this didn't scare the shit out of me. Minding my own business with the doggies I got two $20s from guys who were trying to persuade me in the benefits of scratching each other's backs. Figuring out how to get my point across to these types is something I need to do ASAP. 
'No, I will not hook up with you for money.' 
'No, I will not date you for money.' 'If I'm single or not is irrelevant to you but thanks for the $20! I'm going to snag some breakfast tacos for my boyfran with it.' 
'No, you cannot have my number.' 'Fine, I will take yours and promise to get ahold of you as soon as I get phone turned on and charged later. I absolutely promise!' 
'Absolutely fucking do not try to hug me just to see how my dog reacts to it.'
'NO MEANS NO EVEN FOR HUGS DUDE.' 
Trying to exploit me for my less than favorable situation is the lowest of the low but refusing to take the hint and keep lingering is a sure fire way to get socked in the nuts. I didn't sleep with my fine ass persistent dealers even during my sickest brokest moments, you honestly think I'ma cave for a dude giving me extremely creepy mccreeperson vibes to get a roof over my head for the night? You found me perfectly content in the freezing cold roofless. He needs better leverage or a rag with chloroform. 

I made the full and complete decision to put myself in this situation, have to sacrifice for a better future. Right? I left a warm cozy house with a big comfy bed for this shit. My animals were miserable and treated like Sarah McLaughlin could make a home visit. I constantly heard the lady I lived with telling people my younger dog shouldn't even be alive and if she physically seen him she'd welcome him with a bullet. Enough of that so called animal lover talk and eventually my dog started moping around as if he was suicidal. She constantly threatened calling animal control on me for my cats just for the sheer number I had, not because they were miserable or miss treated. For all of ours sanity I decided a week of semi roughing it was better than another minute in those conditions. She randomly gave me pain pills and bars whenever she had them so I'mma miss that perk for sure. 

I only have to survive til Wednesday morning than I won't have to worry about where I can charge my phone next. I'm worried I made a careless irreplaceable mistake making this decision that has been leading to more than usual stress which makes me want to use more. Catch 22 for sure. I have a support system but am being stubborn about accepting help because I want to handle it all myself for once. 

I'm either going to fail losing everything that matters to me all at once, try to get smart with the wrong creeper and end up in some real life episode of Criminal Minds, or steady stay high and just let the flow decide my fate. ",1520196100.0

I got hit hard leaving a deal and ended up in a conference room with a 3 page contract in front of me. They had me on video and I could do a few years in prison for distribution or sign that and be on my way. I signed. All it really says is you aren't allowed to fuck for dope.

Once you work off your charge you start to get paid. I get paid 10% of whatever gets seized. Ounce of heroin for example street price ,2500 I get paid 250. They give the paper white boy drug prices but paying out not so much.

How it works is this. The deals the CI do the dealers aren't charged. The deals are just to get probable cause for a search warrant for car or home. What that turns up is where the charges come from. This keeps my identity a secret.

The biggest giveaway on deals where narcs are involved are the cars. There will be 4-5 cars shadowing the deal. They are obvious as fuck to me and I have no clue how people don't notice. Also, I don't wear wires, cameras, etc. They are filming from a block away.

I'm in a major city in the south and the one thing I found interesting is as soon as ounces are being discussed it gets kicked over to DEA. I was surprised it took so little to involve them.

I used to shoot all the drugs, and lots of them. Overdoses, seizures - The whole nine.

I stopped and life has done a complete 180. I'm in school and could not be doing better, employed, eating well, exercising, sleeping 9 hours per night...The list goes on.

I want to use hallucinogens again. In my mind, they are completely separate from all other drugs. I've never struggled to moderate my use of psychedelics. If anything, they seem to have anti-addictive, life-affirming properties. 

I want to hear opinions on this from former addicts. The standard 12-step rhetoric shuts this idea down immediately based on principle, but I am interested in a more rational discussion.

Have YOU been able to take hallucinogens sparingly, for personal enrichment, after a period of sobriety? 


Please, only respond if you struggled with addiction. I want firsthand reports. I've already read all of the medical studies pertaining to hallucinogens and addiction, those are not what I'm looking for.

Thank you for sharing your experiences.",1520344211.0

Exams are only a couple of weeks away and I'm missing days of uni atm. But I just can't get myself out of bed. I try to counter the coke hangover with heroin but I ran out now and I'm afraid I'll buy some more coke if I hit up my dboy. It's a cluster fuck.



Using coke doesn't even feel good anymore! I don't feel any part of the rush, but nasty side effects and my tolerance has skyrocketed, not to mention how my arms look. It's expensive and I notice my attention span decreasing. Concentrating and grasping complex concepts is harder than usual. I've been sleeping and thinking about offing myself since I ran out of coke and money on Friday. Still, the cravings are irrationally intense. I've never experienced anything like this with opiates and it's fucking scary. As if my brain is hijacked. 




I know it'll pass, but even without the coke hangover pulling me down - what perspective is there for me? I might have a career lined up but life still isn't really enjoyable to me. Plus for how long will I keep a job with my addiction taking over the front seat every now and then? I feel socially isolated and can't talk to anyone about what I think and feel. My 'friends' don't know or don't care that I'm struggling with one more habit. And I wouldn't know what they could do if they cared. It's not like their knowledge of my addiction or depression makes them ask. It's only small talk and God, am I sick of small talk. 




One of my roommates is consistently trying to make me fall in love with him and is so busy with making good impressions that he doesn't notice what's going on with me. Not that he'd be any help, he's a little thick and has the bad habit of interpreting a woman's kindness as sexual interest. Another bad habit is to only see things in relation to himself, as if he was the center of my universe LOL. It'd be really hilarious if it wasn't so sad. We really don't fit as a couple, but he tries to spit out googled facts to show me that he too can sound smart. It's so pathetic. No one cares what's going on with *me*. And as long as I more or less function and pay my rent they don't have a reason to question if everything is okay.





My mom has multiple sclerosis and I always thought I could die in peace when she's gone. But nooo, my siblings rely on me way too much. There is no other family member that could help them. This whole family relies on me to keep them together and I don't know how I can get out of that responsibility. I don't wanna just pass on my pain to them when I die. They don't deserve that. But it's really  exhausting to live, being me. Especially with the knowledge that I'll be alone forever, only a spectator to life. I won't ever have a relationship or kids. Who would wanna put up with a depressed junkie? And how should I find out if no one comes close to me? 


Also, I miss my mom. We do talk on the phone almost every day but it's more me being there for her. I learned not to overshare as stress worsens her symptoms. So, my closest friend and ally has been taken away from me by this illness. There is no one else who loves me unconditionally and would wanna support me through all this. 




In any case, I thought about making all arrangements for my funeral beforehand, now. So that at least those things are in order for whenever I'll make a split second decision. Has any of you brought your affairs in order, just in case? Maybe 25 is too early, but considering I didn't wanna live when I was 6 it's long overdue. 




I'm sorry for rambling & shitposting, but I've been hanging around in bed since Friday, alone, either sleeping or crying and needed to vent. I'm aware I'm at my most pathetic and I hate myself for it. So please refrain from pointing out what a whiny piece of shit I am bc I already know. Thx for being here. I'll be trying to find money to get some heroins to console meeself.   🖖 hope yall are well and safe! <3",1520338652.0

After reviewing my DM I decided the story was worth sharing with the rest of you. Enjoy.,"**DM** That shit was epic and as I am a fellow resident of _____ where the dog is always one crags list click and text away (actually more like one hundred when all your connects are out town and you are sifting to find the post that seems ""legit"" - with the number of click checks being inversely related to the time between sniffs/shots/drags/etc). 

I digress - just wanted to praise you for your work. Obviously, this dm probably seems quite rando but someone posted about how the sub is almost at 50k followers (def not a karma sloot move only b/c of the joy it brought me and hopefully others). I digress again - but the point being someone reminisced about that competition which took me to the best piece of writing I've found on the internet since our boi Donny T hijacked the ~~fourth reich~~ white house). 

I've been out of work for a week on ~~an unannounced vacation~~ sick leave as I try to pretend as though the this is all in my imagination (completely rational thing to do - you can't tell me otherwise). Long story short I was on a business trip last week couldn't bring my doggie with me on the plane cuz I'm a puss / did not realize how desperate I would be 36 hours later. Two days in the sweats and the ~~rock whale turds~~ shits started to hit real bad and I had to immediately book the next flight home at 430 am and miss the last three days of my work trip - by the time I left the hotel my asshole was a crater from the aforementioned baby turd that was two days over do and I thought my tv was talking to me for a solid hour (for context this process began last Tuesday after I'd already skipped the first day of the trip on Monday and curled in a ball in my hotel room (also puked everything I ate that day on the bed which was pretty much only chocolate nut pretzels needless to say that combination probably painted a poor picture for the hotel staff so I left a hefty tip seeing as they probably thought that the puke was actually dukie from one night stand with a hooker that specializes in acts such as the dirty Sanchez ..... and I haven't even mentioned the scene at the toilet). 

Since then I haven't not been back to work and I've just been texting in sick to my manager everyday last minute and then shutting off my phone with the thought that if I can't see his response it never happened (can you confirm if that works - you wrote the new gospel so you seem like a good person to ask). I totally don't work in an industry where that is acceptable and I'm dreading going back to work (as I stated I too am from ___ so if I'm gonna go in tomorrow aka today I would be getting ready in about ~~1 hr 48 minutes~~ 1 hr 19 minutes). Anyway reading your erotic rhymes made me feel a bit better through the dread that is now surfacing after a week far from reality. I ~~Now am~~ was in the process of getting high as fook on the doof (daer sdrawkcab) - those last three words are scrambled for some mind masturbation to start your lovely day). 

One last thank you and I sincerely hope to hear back from you. **End of DM**

I don't have anyone to really vent to right now so I made this account in hopes I could find comfort in this community...

Well, she caught me.  It's completely breaking my heart seeing her cry.  But, I'm too numb to cry myself.  I am sick to my stomach.  I feel horrible, and I'm definitely not proud.  I completely understand her being mad at me.  I lied.  This wasn't a small secret.  But it is kind of killing me that she can't be more understanding.  It's hard to just turn away forever once this shit comes into your life.  She has no faith in me right now and that hurts.  I didn't relapse to hurt her.  I relapsed in a moment of weakness.  I wanted to escape my life because honestly, I kind of hate it.  I'm depressed.  I'm constantly having anxiety attacks.  But a little dope helps me hide.  I can kick the shit out of the toughest days when I'm high.

She flushed it all down the toilet.  I still have to get through my work week.

Mine would mostly be related on being treated humanely when taking an opiate, more specifically Suboxone. I realized that while i may be dependant on opiates, i am addicted because i am dependant, and i do not have the mindstate of an addict and do not want to classify myself as a drug addict or drug abuser. 


i hated AA and NA for their reasoning to reinforce their opinion of what they think that you should be and how you should act and operate your life. I disdain the government for forcing what we can and cannot put into our bodies . And a few more things that i wont get that deep into at the moment but i hope that you do.

Now, our feature presentation:


I told Cliff that I'm not buying dope this coming pay day and was met with no resistance. For some reason I expected him to try and convince me to commit to buying dope. I'll still pick up his script as previously promised and he's still going to give me two roxy 15mg's for my effort. + he's willing to trade me a 15mg roxy per a Suboxone strip. Of course, if I can only get the pills... we'll see if he's still interested.


Initially I told him I'd be happy getting nothing from him that day, but if he really needs subs then I'll get him four or five of them in exchange for four or five roxies. I certainly can't expect him to give me cash for subs so better off getting paid in whatever is readily available. If he don't want the subs I'm getting,then I won't accept the roxies he's offering me in trade.


&nbsp;

From there... I thought about buying a drone or telescope but then I had another brainstorm. The original bullshit reason I gave him for not being able to buy dope this week was to have money to pay for a $300 certification. Well, as it turns out.. that certification does indeed cost $300. Might as well get fucking certified. I've been meaning to do that for a while but I just kept postponing it in lieu of pot, and then pills and dope.


&nbsp;


The only thing Cliff said aside from general acknowledgment of my plan to get certified was ""It's gonna be a rough week from Thursday until the following Thursday."" Since I'm not planning to tap his supply of roxies and I'll even help him get some subs as long as he has something of equal value up front, I don't think it'll be a rough week for him.

If he does finish his subs and pills prematurely, it's not my problem. 

&nbsp;

**Funny fact, one which may rightfully get me lambasted:**


In the past when it's Cliff's pay day I've been paid in dope to make an ATM run with *his* card. I never took it upon myself to memorize his card number but of course I memorized his PIN to be able to withdraw money.


On two occasions that were months apart, I had to send Cliff to the ATM with my card on pay day to buy dope. He would take out an agreed upon amount and then I would come through on my lunch break to pick up my dope and partake in ripping a couple of bags.  As a result of those two occasions, **Cliff memorized my card number.** For a while this didn't cause any problems so I left it alone.


&nbsp;

On almost every one of my pay days in recent time however, as I wake up and drink my coffee while waiting for the direct deposit to roll in, Cliff would call the automated bank hotline to check the balance on my card. When the deposit rolled in, Cliff would call or text me to inform me of the amount. From there I would tell him how much dope I plan to buy and then I'd make my way to the ATM to get the cash.


It felt a little creepy that Cliff was checking my balance for me but it was convenient.

&nbsp;

THEN, on a couple of more recent occasions Cliff would ask me if he could order food on my card and would offer to pay me back in pills. When he still had pills during my pay day, this was not a problem. Of course if I said ""you can spend $30"" he'd spend $32. Then another time he said ""If I spend more than 30 this time, I'll give yo a fourth pill."" Well of course that time he spent $42 though I guess I can't be a stickler since my $4 breakfast sandwich was part of that order and he still gave me  a 4th pill, a $40 value after paying for his $38 in food.


**Nonetheless**, it creeps me out that he can and does check my card balance. Especially in the middle of a pay cycle. There was one time he ordered food and I didn't even know until two days later. I had to review my account history to pin-point it. When I texted him about it he said, ""yeah, you said it was okay."" Which I most certainly did not since it was $30 out of my last $50. He of course did pay me back in pills a week later but that doesn't replenish my cold hard cash for the preceding week. 

&nbsp;

More recently, I got a second debit card. Upon getting paid, I transfer a lion's share of my money to that card. So if Cliff asks me if he can order food, I can say no without being guilted for contributing to his mom's starvation.

A couple of weeks ago he caught a glimpse of my new debit card while I was racking up a line of dope and said ""do I need to memorize a new card number?"". Motherfucker, no! Well, that's what I said in my mind. Verbally, I told him it was an invalid prepaid card or some bullshit. Since then I've made sure not to let that card see the light of day in Cliff's house.

&nbsp;


Of course I can lock him out of my direct deposit card by changing the pin or eliminating that card but then if I need him to run to the ATM in the future on my behalf, he would get the chance to memorize my new card. So for just a little longer I'll pretend all is hunky-dory but obviously if I continue not to buy dope on pay day with Cliff as I am planning this week, that card will go the way of the Dodo. 

&nbsp;

In the mean time, I'll get paid, then I'll immediately transfer money to the card number he doesn't know so that when he checks my balance, he'll get the perception that I can't loan him any money for food because I'm broke. All the while the money that I plan to spend on tech certifications, a drone or a telescope will be safely stored on in an account that he cannot see or touch.

&nbsp;

 
#Phase 1
**Stop spending money on pay day to buy dope with Cliff.** If I was to spend money on dope this pay day and let Cliff middle for me, I'd have to buy dope for him and myself. So if I wanted two buns, I'd only get one bun for my own consumption. If I wanted Four buns, I'd have to buy five buns because there's a discount and then I'd still have to share half my order with him.

Sure, he'd pay me back for the part of the order that I got for him but he would not give me cold hard cash. He would likely give me some pills and some dope a week later. No, thank you.

&nbsp;

I'm excited about phase one. Now that I have that in the clear, I have one more option in addition to tech certification, a drone or a telescope. 


I can buy myself dope with my friend Tim (not to be mistaken with Tom). Tim will not scam or rob me. Furthermore, if I buy dope with Tim, I don't have to loan him half of whatever I buy. I could literally buy myself a small amount of dope and then still have money left over for a drone, a telescope or a certification. Whereas, if I bought dope with Cliff, I could not do any of these things.


Not the best idea, but I have it in the back of my head so that I **do not** get the temptation to buy dope with Cliff at all on pay day.",1520313403.0

Like when u actually manage to get some sleep? I went to USA on holiday to meet my parents who had come from Australia for my bday and stupidly didn't bring enough gear. My girlfriend got me Unisom which is an OTC sleeping pill. I took like a handful of them one night and had this crazy dream/s. First I was in like Afghanistan or something, trapsing thru the desert and came across this town where all the kids had no arms or legs, turned out there was no food and the adults were eating these kids arms and legs to sustain themselves. Still tried to score there, eventually got my hands on some dodgy looking shit then I woke up (typical). 

The next part of my dream, somehow I'd made it back to UK and I was with my middle at some council estate. Kano (the grime MC) was there doing heaps of meth and trying to hit me with a steel pipe for some reason. Anyway, again I eventually got on and tried to catch a cab from UK to USA before my parents noticed I was gone. I woke up really confused thinking I had stashed a wine glass that I was using to smoke gear beside the bed. It was really disorientating.

I really hate doctors. Especially my last two experiences.
Needless to say, i am prescribed Suboxone and have a very substantial stash of codeine

Phase 1 of my plan was to detox suboxone down to 1/16 of a 2mg tablet,
Then transition to very lose Codeine or Dihydrocodeine 
Until my pain levels out
At which point i would continue using Codeine and Dihydrocodeine for pain relief and Buprenorphine itself in a mega-low doseage (i.e. 0.2 mcg or 0.4 mcg )

and transitioning back and forth honestly in seek of effect of pain relief.

If i can get my Suboxone down to a low enough amount, quit, use a different opiate for pain,
Then if i absolutely need it, use Suboxone again, it would most likely obtain its pain killing effects rather than just other effects that do not manage my pain. most likely due to being on buprenorphine specifically for over 10 years straight

I just wanted to update my situation for anyone who may have caught some of my desperate pleas for advice on here. Anyway, I’ve been “trying” to get clean for the past 5ish months, but I’ve also been chipping here and there whenever I’ve been able to get away with it. Well, that time has come to an end as I must begin Outpatient services at the beginning of next week. So, obviously I have been full on obsessed with having “one last hurrah” with my frienemy, lady dope. Here’s where things get hella complicated...

I live an hour (approximately 50 miles) away from the nearest big city, which is where my 2 d-boys reside. (Yes, I only have 2. I’m a loser, I know. Ha ha ha.) It’s always been a pain in the ass, but I haven’t had access to a vehicle for several months. Thus, living in the country and working in a small city (which is still an hour away from the big city, and doesn’t have any public transportation to take you that far) has made copping damn near impossible. 

Now, over the past few months I’ve had some “luck” with either, paying a shit-ton of money for a taxi (which was $200 ONE WAY), randomly getting hooked up with the ONE Uber/Lyft in town (which is magical as it’s frequently nowhere to be found), borrowing a co-workers car (which I had to be stupid discrete about), and my d-boy actually let me send an Uber to bring him to me and take him back home a handful of times (which he has adamantly refused to do any longer.... I honestly don’t think he would do it if I offered him like $400 for one fucking bundle at this point... craziness, right?).

Anyway, all of these routes have been straight up dead ends for the past week that I’ve been trying. Which makes total sense considering this was my last chance to use for quite awhile (hopefully forever, honestly), so why would things work out in my favor, ya know? After these all fell through, I actually tried several other different ways to get something, ANYTHING to work. I won’t go too far into details about those other plans though for certain, needed   reasons. LOL. Of course those were all dead ends too anyway. Of. Fucking. Course. 

But, FINALLY, today my junkie ass was smiled upon. I got out of work hella early, and there was an Uber 10 minutes from me willing to drive me into the city, and my d-boy was actually good and ready for me!!!  (The last time had a ride set up to take me to the smaller city I work in and then an Uber AND Lyft both magically driving around said town, my dude told me to come through but 15 minutes later said to “Hold up, bro.” because he didn’t have any fucking dope and wasn’t gonna get more until later that evening, when I no longer had a ride into the smaller city!!!)

So. Ya’ll. I finally got my “one last hurrah”!!! (Of course as we’re walking around shady back alleys in a rather hot area of the city, my d-boy takes my money for a brick, hands me 3 bundles and says “I got 2 for ya the next time you come though.” What. The. Actual. Fuck. Whatever, it is what it is.)

Anyway, I’m currently happy and high and chillin’ like a villain. I just wanted to say, THANK YOU SO MUCH to everyone who took time out to analyze my situation and give me a bunch of terrific advice and ideas. AND to those of you who simply sympathized with me and gave me many beautiful words of encouragement. There truly are a shit-ton of awesome, amazing, smart, sweet peeps in here. And I have SO much love for yinz wonderful people. 

Thanks again, ya’ll! Stay safe out there. Much love to you guys!

Put down the opiates but drank at least a fifth a day til i was 27, when i began getting sober.  I got some real time and each relapse began getting shorter and shorter.  Finally got 18 months and had a job paying 600 a week before tax.  Thats not much but its something i never had and I was very proud and finally financially stable... two months ago they let me go.  For the first time in my life it wasnt my fault, they gave me a severance package and all those that mattered promised to be strong references... still hurt like hell though.

I applied lots and within a month got a second interview and I did splendidly.  They made a formal offer for more hourly than I have ever made, health insurance, 401k, and lots of room to grow. This was it, I finally had a chance at a career.  I waited to be scheduled for training, did the urinalysis, and fingerprinting.  The only thing on my background is an OWI 9 years ago and they knew about it.  They said it would not be an issue - misdemeanor, old, and no jail time.  Except there was... a little... jail time, that is.  I popped a roxy and failed a urine screen way back then, it wasnt even a habit to use on probation but all the same, I was caught.  I did seven days for that.

What I didnt know was that it mattered.  What i didnt know was that counted.  I was called today and thought I was going to get scheduled for training.  Instead they said my offer was no longer valid, the jobs gone.  

I was going to get healthcare.  I was going to get my first suit.  I was going to get pride from showing others my business card....

82a3un,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/82a3un/strange_preferences_anyone_else/,14,https://redd.it/82a3un,oxywhy,"Strange preferences, anyone else?","I've tried a few drugs now, and I feel as if I don't like what most people swear by, but on the other hand, I love what people tend to say ""has little to no effect"".


For example, hydrocodone and oxycodone do *almost nothing* for me. I feel a little bit of a head rush, they work as actual painkillers and everything, but overall I wouldn't say I feel ""high"" or even euphoric. On top of that, they both cause horrible constipation for me, so I avoid them unless I need them for a medical reason.


I thought this was weird because from what I've heard online, these are both supposed to be great highs, yet I get almost nothing out of them.


On the other hand, I've had Codeine, just 30mg tabs, and I **loved it**. Super tingly, and euphoric, even just talking to other people gave me this wave of pleasure. In fact, I'd probably say Codeine would be my drug of choice, if I could get my hands on more.


Compared to hydros and oxy, it was night and day. Even a couple grams of Kratom gives me much more effects than ""stronger"" opioids. 


To be honest, I'd trade oxycodone or hydrocodone for Codeine or even Kratom any day of the week. Which isn't an opinion I've seen *anywhere* online. 


I still have yet to try Morphine, which I think I might like, because Codeine is mainly just a morphine prodrug, but I have trouble wrapping my mind around not liking oxy for example, because it's supposed to be stronger than morphine.


My question is, has anyone heard of/had similar experiences? Also, is there a biological reason I might not be receptive to certain opiates? Thanks :)

A suggestion....not exactly what you think!,"So after talking to someone about NA, etc. I thought of something, why not form our own group, called OA, based online? We basically follow the 12 steps, but we don't take that hardline approach that can scare addicts.


I guess the difference is, I think we as a community, could help each other out, those who want to stay clean, or those who just want to stay alive. This isn't a sobreity only group. 

This is a quality of life group. I want to improve our quality of life, individually. If you use opiates, we should help you with HR, not turn you away or chastise you. 

You'll quit when your ready, and when that time comes, we will be there, but we don't want to be pushy. The main rules of the sub will be followed, i.e. no sourcing etc, the crap that comes with operating a private chat.


I feel that NA can be a little harsh and scare others away. My intent, is this is a bridge, or so, to ease people who may not be comfortable with NA, to give it a shot.


Honestly, I thought NA was bullshit, but I gave it a shot this last month, and earnest shot. I don't really believe it all, and I still find crap in it I don't agree with, but I can't deny it. 


Something positive is happening in my life. Is this a good idea? I was thinking something alongs the line of a chatroom like r/trees has. Maybe this breaks a rule on here, but I looked and nothing suggests this.

Thoughts? Suggestions? Insults?


**TLDR: I want to make an all-inclusive group, of users and those who are clean or trying to get clean from opiates. Even if you have no urge to ever get clean, you can join. That's the premise. Yes kinda like this sub, but more....focused on taking active steps in HR**


 Because this group is about harm reduction and improving quality of life (and maybe segwaying into NA, but we don't want to push their doctrine). No coins/tags, no counting days, the only thing we care about is ""how is your day, are you okay, safe? If not lets talk about it, I think a lot of us have had really shit days, and can help someone else get through it.  

Like say you're having a problem shooting up correctly, this is a place you can come for advice with no judgement. And if you want to get clean, we should be there for each other too. I know people who are using, find hope sometimes when they hear others getting clean, and it may effect them down the road.

I just feel, NA is lacking something, whatever that thing was, it kept me away from attempting to reach out to people who were willing to help.


Any of the mods want to weigh in?


For some reason I feel there's a huge hole in my plan, and this is horrible lol, but I'd totally be down to learning how to run a chat and stuff. Maybe I just dun smoked too much weed today, and think everything is a good idea.

I am interested to know what your withdrawl symptoms are, some experience all and some experience unique and also just certian symptoms but harsher.

I have never ever been sick when in withdrawls, when most say that is the most common, my most common symptom in severe goosebumps and no appetite.
The sleep and wake in 1 hour soaked is horrific that is my worst symptom by a million miles.

Tonight I have managed to feel 70% better and eat a bag of Haribo, 1/4 cheesecake some McDonald's fries and some noodles.

Do you think I could awake tomorrow with no appetite again and restart the process? Or do you believe when a symptom improves it improves for the duration of the withdrawl?

I know I am waffling, I am just trying to understand the chemistry and the kindling effect of these withdrawls, it's such a unique and horrific experience, the worst flu you could get is alot better than this, due to the none mental aspect that lingers.

I have been snorting .5mg or suboxone every few hours to take the edge and this is day 3 of my detox.

I have 3mg of suboxone left now, do i even need to 're dose to try sleep if I am not in need? Or should I save it for tomorrow, or maybe just use like .25 mg before bed now?

(communicate my intent not to buy dope with Cliff on pay day),"#Note: Scroll down to the long horizontal line and bold text that says ""Start here"" if you don't want to read a whole bunch of background info to build up to the point of this post.

&nbsp;

Last two times I was at Cliff's house were a couple of days ago. The first was to watch SVU and Waco and that did generate my previous and most recent Cliffpost. Secondly was to help him buy subs. For once he actually wanted to buy subs in a timely manner but his sub connects suck or barely exist so of course I was requested to accomplish this mission through my contacts.


&nbsp;

My contact was originally going to come to me but due to rain and hunger they opted to go to the local fast food joint. It was pouring rain outside so the connect offered me one extra sub for biking over. Cliff paid for four subs and agreed to give me one. Of course I didn't tell him about the fifth free sub so I pocketed that as well. All-in-all, I did pretty well for myself.

&nbsp;

That night stuck around after delivery I stuck around Cliff's for all of thirty minutes. During that time we glossed over a couple of topics. For one, he shared a story about his attempted trade/transaction with our neighbors. One of them being the hardcore benzo enthusiast who wanted to trade three blues for many xannies. Cliff didn't want to trade, he proffered cash to buy a bundle of dope. The benzo enthusiast wanted $25 when he paid $20 and he felt that he deserved to make a little money off of each. With Cliff, he wanted two for $5 on the benzos when fair market value could easily reel in more cash per pill. 


Moff, the benzo enthusiast argued that Cliff didn't pay a lot for the benzos so he shouldn't charge as much. Okay fair enough, Moff always wants top dollar for shit but always wants to low ball. Just about every selfish actor in trade.

&nbsp;

Tom, not to be mistaken with Tim lives nearby as well and is often the middleman for Cliff. Tom is the one who ratted me out indirectly for doing dope. The true details are murky and will never be fully known but when I was told that my brother was coming over to ""talk about something very important"" on a particular Saturday, I had a hunch what it was about. Once I had a hunch on what it was about, it wasn't very hard to guess the source of the leak.


Months later, Tom apologized to me for being the source of the leak. He said, ""I was talking to my mom and my brother must've overheard...""


WTF, why the fuck does he think it's cool to talk about my dope habit and my need to purchase suboxone before a trip with his mom. He probably told his brother directly, but if he did only tell his mom.. she has a big mouth as well so I'm lucky the info didn't spread with more virility. In conclusion, I believe Tom spoke about my activities in order to soften the negative impact of his mother knowing about his own activity. ""Look, Sloany does this shit too and he's a bright fella."" After the fact I told this mofo, like WTF... I don't tell my family that you do dope and smoke crack. As far as they're concerned you're a professional in whatever you do. Well, in reality I used to say that. I stopped covering and started slandering his good name in front of my immediate family after the information leak as part of my damage control.


&nbsp;

After the info leak, my brother came over to have the talk and stage the intervention. The first question aside from how I was doing, of course it was the master inquiry. Am I doing dope? Where the fuck did you hear that from? Around the neighborhood you say? 


I love when someone rats you out or accuses you of something and nobody will tell you who. Like when I was kid in school and someone ratted me out for throwing food across the cafeteria or some other shit. Later on in life when I hear the saying, ""you have the right to face your accuser"", I think back to all the times I could've quoted that phrase when I was kid. Of course, the schools are like mini dictatorships. As for family interaction, I don't know why I can't be told who the fuck the source of the information leak is. Perhaps this is to make it more challenging for me to cover my tracks? It's not like I'm going to go beat the shit out of a friend who contacted my brother out of concern for my well being. 


&nbsp;


So anyway, a few months ago we have this talk in the family room due to an information leak. Aside from asking whether I was doing dope, my sibling also said, ""I was told that you tried to sneak Suboxone on to an airplane."" I truthfully stated, I did not *try* to sneak Suboxone on to a plane. I also attested to the fact that I went through a full body scan and physical frisking. Since I had a hunch of who made the information leak, I made up a story about a weed transaction gone awry and spoke about how Tom is in fact a crackhead. Crack is the worst (exaggeration) and people who do crack and heroin are even worse. **Would you trust the word of a crackhead-heroin addict?** Apologies to anybody who likes Crack and Dope who is reading, but this did prove effective as a means to draw suspicion away from myself.


In the end of that discussion, my brother was sufficiently satisfied as was my father after a urine test. Yes, many of us know that urine tests can be thrown and this proved effective in this instance.


&nbsp;
________________________________________________

#Start here if you don't care for the background info:

**During that intervention, before I sufficiently convinced the inquisition that I was not consuming dope, my brother stated, ""so, there is a detox period."" To which I responding, ""which is entirely unnecessary since I have nothing to detox from!""**


Fast forward to two days ago, I'm sitting at Cliff's kitchen table as he's prepping himself a line. I took a portion of a sub that day as I did for the days prior, the topic of cessation came up. I referenced the time I had that mini-intervention and how my brother referenced the ""detox period."" Cliff made light of addiction by saying that I needed detox as much as he didn't need Jenny Craig (he's a fat bastard). He argued that I by no means needed to detox, supposing that I wouldn't go through too much Withdrawal, if any whenever I stopped using dope.

&nbsp;

I felt like I was being told the sky is not blue. I know that I can at least experience withdrawal symptoms that last a solid three days. After the worst of it things smooth out but it still isn't the easiest week. This is why it's easy for someone to be drawn back to using dope once they have the means to get dope after seven days of nothing. If I wasn't addicted, I wouldn't be going out of my way to get Suboxone before getting dope-sick. 


It's like he sees the writing on the wall, that I'm not super committed to spending a bunch of money on dope this coming pay day. I've hinted many ways by indicating that there is no certainty that I'll buy dope this coming pay day. I still told him regardless of what I do, I'll still pick up his roxy script this week if time permits.",1520283089.0

Need all ya'lls opinions. Vote here!,"Confusing title, but here's the deal:  I had a relatively brief but intense run with h/fent.  Using one 8mg sub to detox.  Down to .5 sub per day, and tomorrow is my last day.  I'm hoping that I can come off ok, but based on how I feel before I take my sub each day, I think there will be residual sickness.  I have to get through work/family/life.  Here are my options:

1.  Just use pregabalin/Xanax until it passes (my preference, time to empty the receptors)
2.  Use small amounts of tramodol (like 150mg split into 2 doses throughout the day) for a day or two. 
3.   Use small amounts of Kratom for a day or two (not my preference, I dont love it.  But it's effective)
4.   Use lope.  I have easy access to it.  Never used it And don't know much about it.

So I don’t usually IV and if I do I get a bag of works and use those till they’re done. Usually don’t reuse them either. When the bag is done I’ll be cool off shooting for hella long. 

Any ways I just did a shot and as soon as I took the needle out I got this intense ass itchy weird fucking feeling. I can’t even really describe the feeling. It went away immediately but i never felt that before. I feel like I might have done too much. Hey I don’t recall seeing anybody that mentioned this sensation in a post. It was itchy but not itchy, like idk how to explain it but it was uncomfortable. I got all hot too. My face especially. Idk if it had anything to do with the amount of dope I did or what. I do know that I definitely felt uncomfortable from this shot. I’m pretty sure it was too much dope. I usually do the same amount. That was the last rig in the bag I had too. It’s been 4 days with shooting/dabbing. So it’s not like it was my first shot I’ve had in months or anything like that. It’s not different dope. I also didn’t use very much water it was pretty thick and dark. Idk doesn’t matter really.....all that matters is I’m okay and didn’t have any mishaps. I didn’t like feeling so uncomfortable like that. 

Also, might as well mention this because I’ve been wanting to ask this just haven’t made a post yet......

I can’t for the life of me IV anywhere else but the crooks of my arms. I’ve tried in tons of places and can’t register. I don’t IV a lot so it’s not a huge issue for me but I don’t like only shooting in the crooks of my arms for the couple of days I do IV. The past few days of IV and both crooks have bruises on them. I’ve even gone as far as trying to hit my neck before and thank god I couldn’t register. 

I guess I’m just a noob lol only reason for this post really was because of the uncomfortable itchy sensation I got right after the shot. I try not to post things that have been asked a million times but I couldn’t really find any post mentioning a word of this ",1520409522.0

If so how does it interact with opiates? Does it diminish the high? Does it make the SSRI not work? 

I'm currently on Paxil and this is my 14th day taking it. I'm still feeling opiates just as well and I'm not noticing any negative reactions. I am having some side effects but their not severe and it's nothing I cannot handle. Erectile dysfunction, a strange energy, nausea, and some diahrrea to name a few. It's hard to say what's from opiate WD and what's from the Paxil though. When I'm on opiates I don't notice the Paxil at all.

Do you guys think that doing opiates 4 to 5 days a week will cause the Paxil not to be effective? I know it takes six weeks to work fully so I guess I will find out. I still don't know how feel about SSRIs but I'll know soon. I often feel that it's all bs and mostly placebo but millions of Americans are on them, and many feel it helps so it's hard to argue with statistics like that.

Thanks for the replies everyone. I'll give an update in a couple weeks and let people know if I feel it's helping or what.

Isn’t is harder to make Heroin? Extra steps in the creation process? Also doesn’t it then yield less Heroin in weight than Morphine would? 

Now let’s assume that they both are just as easy to make or that the cooking process is trivial. Why isn’t Morphine created and distributed as much as Heroin is on the streets/black market? Like, I’m POSITIVELY POSITIVE that people/junkies would have just as much of a want for Morphine as is with Heroin. Also on the legal side, Morphine is less of a charge than Heroin considering their scheduling.

Just for me when I shoot, I turn into a shooting machine and my ""barely keeping my head out of the water"" functioning completely falls apart.

Anyway I have done a lot of detox over the last 25 years both residential and at home. I know what works and what I need. I am only back on since early December and currently have cut back to 0.75g a day which keeps me ok and mildly stoned. Not a hope of a nod but still a nice hit.

At 23 I started using morphine and the needle. I did that for several years. I was married to a man that had a great job, LOTS of $$, and was always gone :-/ so it was easy to hide my doings. (He eventually found my shit when I was 31 and quickly divorced me. I can't blame him. No hate there.) But anyway, I always used legit morphine. I had always been scared to death of H. All the stories of ppl dying and stuff. Plus, money wasnt a prob so I stuck with the M's. 
About 6 months ago a guy I use every once in awhile when my normal connects are dry, started dealing the H. And he gave me a lil piece of foil with some in it to try. I took it home and hid it. Stayed there for a week and then money got tight and I got sick and I thought....what the hell? Right? 
Cook it and bang.....and.....nothing. My cousin told me what he gave us each what one good dose. Yet....nothing. I sat disappointed, and wondering 'ppl actually prefer this over morphine?' 
You see....I have friends that prefer the H. And they have always said 'its heaven' 'you think morphine from the pharmacy is great, try this...' Blah blah blah. So I was just expecting so much more than the nothing I got. 
Also, I'm alil different from my friends. They do H or morphine and they are nodding and giddy and shit. But when I do morphine I'm energized, and have this amazing euphoria, and feel ready to conquer the world which usually just means an in depth cleaning of my house. 
So....are there any of y'all that get energized by morphine? Like...I dont 'nod' or whatever, I smash 120 mg in my veins and I'm the energizer bunny! So any of y'all like that? And if y'all are....is H the same for y'all? I had a friend say that even if morphine wired me up H wouldnt. In yalls experience is that true? Because I just don't like that feeling. I dont want to ""nod"" my high away. I want to get high and get shit done lol. 
Sorry for the long post. I'm just curious. Because the nurse in me says: H is just man-made morphine outside of a factory so it should do the same thing. Yet I have ppl telling me that if morphine gives me energy H still won't? ",1520527039.0

Thinking to myself, damn, I need to get well. I desperately try to find any cottons I have and put them in the spoon. Dousing all my cottons in the water and mashing it with the end of my rig. Hopefully this works I proclaim. The water has a hint of brown and I am thinking that it might work. As I register and see the blood going back I think I am going to hit the relief I have been seeking but as I am injecting it all I can barely feel anything. 

I lay back down in my bed thinking about the 5 hour round trip I would have to make to meet with my Mexican in the City. I call him and tell him I am on the way. ""How Long?"", dreadfully I said about 2 1/2 hours. He says ok and I get my jacket and jeans as I head out to the snowy mountain roads where I don't know if i'll make it back but I sure as hell will die trying.

I try to distract myself with music but the pain is great as I drive mindlessly down the high way. I eventually get to the spot and give him a call and now all of sudden I have to take a leak. There are no spots as I am near a park and neighborhood. I have a soda can and without thinking I procceed to piss in it. I soon realize this was a mistake as I hear the sound of the soda can being filled and I panic. I try to stop pissing but to no avail and some of it gets split over my hand and jeans. Is this rock bottom I ask myself? I try to shake those thoughts and praying he comes soon so I can feel numb and forget about the hours of agony I already endured this morning. 

I finally score and I go to a lot near a medical building like I routinely do. Dump about a .7 of that mexican dog food on a spoon filling the needle with liquid as black as my heart has become. I am no longer human, I live for the rush. Nothing comes before it, personal, work, or family. How did I get to this point? How did it get this out of hand? I am not sure but each and every time I do it I forget about all my worries and all of sudden the day is beautiful again. ",1520521971.0

anyways i've been clean a little over 6 months now, and the first 3-4 months i was drinking a lot, and i never ever got hangovers before in my life and i went through like a 2 year phase of drinking socially, but very heavily 4-5 times a week. anyways after those 3-4 months i quit drinking for about a month because i realised i was starting to get hangovers, anyways this last month i started drinking again and it's been REALLY fucking me up. like the first time i drank, i had 2 mikes harder drinks, the cranberry ones and i was puking for like 4 hours, bile and all. so i stopped again and about 2-3 weeks ago i had TWO beers and i was just way drunker than i should have been, and the next day i was throwing up/shitting my brains out and felt like i couldn't move i was so weak. i called it a fluke but it happened 2 more times so i quit drinking again.

my only thought is this must be my liver somehow, i pray to god its not cause i'm only 25 and i just can't deal with that shit right now. 

been doing drugs since i was 12-13 and i feel like it caught up with me WAY sooner than i had ever expected.

Tunrs out, the certification test I lied about, is totally affordable and even after buying dope for myself, since I only spent half of what I normally would I have more than enough money to pay for the certification, buy subs, bike parts and other random non-drug related stuff. I could buy a drone but then I would have just barely enough money for the certification so I'll wait a bit longer. It's better to rack up whatever certifications I can ace tests for because once I have a higher paying job I can buy a drone.


Two weeks from now on pay day I'll tell Cliff that I can't buy dope with him again because I decided to get clean and am getting more certifications which wont be far from the truth. Whether I'll get clean or not for real.. I'm not sure but I think reducing the stress associated with constantly spending double to help Cliff borrow dope will make it easier for me to kick. By not letting him manage my funds on my behalf, and by not spending money that I don't want to spend, life will be better.


&nbsp;

Aside from certifications and low stress dope purchases, I also look forward to:



A) Getting a drink with a couple of normie friends.



B) Going out with my wingman. I don't know exactly waht it is, but I have a friend who I used to work with and whenver I am with him and his female friends or female friends of his friends are out..... at least one of them takes a liking to me. Yes, I know I have it in me but I've never had a friend who has been as effective of a wingman as thsi friend. I haven't been able to leverage this friendship because of my escalating dope habit. If I say to Cliff ""I have $800 but I want to ekep the order small so I can advance my dating and flining ops"", he'll try to convince or trick me into fucking that up. 



C) Starships. I was thinking about siging up for that thing where they mail you two Star Trek ships a month.



D) More data storage, more anime, parts for shit...



E) My bike deserves ugrades. Not just the upgrades eiher, basic maintenace like my chain is long overdue. It's working well but I really should get a new chain before it gets worn down more.



F) 🐢  My beloved turtles. 🐢 They deserve so much better.🐢  This week I will go to the hardware store and buyt the remainder of the pieces required to allow the two brats to cohabitate a very large tank safely. Basically, 🐢  they need a divider | 🐢 | 🐢 | in the big tank so that they don't fight and bite. Beyond that, I need to buy a $50 light bulb.🐢 

&nbsp;

So yeah, the afformentioned list is of things th at haven't been getting my attention partially because I can **never** get cash back when I buy dope with Cliff and share/loan him half of the order. This was unsustainable in the begining and I should've stopped it when it started. If I wasn't kicking I should've found my own dope connect. Though, I think having my own connect for subs is way more important and am glad I took care of that first.


Beyond that, it'll be way easier for me to kick if I don't have to worry about Cliff's reaction when I suddenly say ""I'm not buying"" because it'll no longer be *sudden*. 


&nbsp;

Established pattern: If it's my pay day and Cliff is broke til next week, when I buy dope he's my only connect to connects. So he's like my double middle. I get the money after direct deposit occurs, tell him what to order and he handles it.


From there, let's say I paid for five bundles. Typically we split the order in half. Cliff pays me back within a week. When he does pay me back, he never gives me cash. Lately he's consistely paid me back with 15 mg oxy's from his script. In the past he has paid me back on his pay day in dope, other times both.

&nbsp;

Sometimes we end up even and then on rare occasions he gets paid before I do and he ends up buying dope for the two of us. Like weeks ago he got eight buns/bundles. I got four buns out of that. Other times he ordered 5 buns and I got two out of it. Same for him. At an earlier point in time I thought it was going to be consistently disproprtionate but we sometimes take turns being disproportiate so that's cool.


&nbsp;

What's not cool is when I pay double to get half the order for myself. The other half, he pays me back for but enver in cash. If I need cash, like this one time weeks ago he said ""I'll sell a couple of pills to my sister for you."" Days later it didn't happen, or more accurately he did sell a couple of pills to his sister but used it for himself. Then ended u pgiving me two extra pills weeks later because by then I didn't need the cash anymore and I didnt' want to wait an eternity to get the fucking cash.

&nbsp;



I wanted to break the cycle so that I'd be in a better position to get clean when I choose to. Before getting clean, I really wanted to experience buying dope without having to share half the order as a loan.


So I mad arrangements with my old pal Tim. I was willing to bike 10 miles to see him if he took the day off from work due to snow, luckily he did not so I met him on the way to work. It was perfect. No middleman fee at all. Like I got everything I paid for.

&nbsp;


The money I didn't spend buying loaner dope for Cliff, will now go towards a certification test that I need and want. Alternatively, if I fail the practice test I Can buy a drone this week and wait until the next pay cycle to do the certification. **I'll probably ace the practice test and pay for the certification test registration this week.** Next week Cliff gets paid, maybe he'll offer to loan me dope to be owed. At that time I must be strong and resist because I don't want to share or loan dope money to Cliff two weeks from now.



I shouldn't buy dope two weeks from now, I should on track for getting clean but if I buy dope it needs to be like it was today. No bullshit. I pay for what's mine and i get what's mine. The cash that's nto spend on me is cash that I still have for spending whatever I need or want in life.

&nbsp;

No more of this taking turns buying dope bullshit. If anything, I'll help him procure subs at best but of course as I've done since late November, if he doesn't pony up anything for the subs, he aint getting subs. When I get a lot of subs, I never tell him how many I really have so he can't get complacent and say ""I don't need subs, sloan will just give me some if I beg or offer to trade something.""


Speaking of, this week when I pretneded not to buy dope as far as Cliff know... I certainly didn't get it through him and his middle.... he wants subs so he offered to trade me 5 roxies at 15mg each, which is not a great value of a trade.

&nbsp;


Coincidentally, when Tim heard that I was getting paid in roxies for waking up early to pick up Cliff's script today, he wanted some. Tim has subs but he like roxies more. So he offered to trade whatever I could spare. So we agreed, 5 15s for 5 sub strips. Now when I bring subs to Cliff, he'll offer to pay me in roxies so it loosk like both Tim and I are are seperately takig a minor hit costwise. 


In conclusion, it's nice not having to share and loan out half of my total dope order.",1520509411.0

Took that drink and had a blast.. Did what people do at 21 but at the age of 24.. several months later my dad is diagnosed with stage 4 cancer and several months after that he had a stroke. My life changed in an instant and I got to take care of him at home. I obviously stopped going to meetings after my first drink which I regretted.  Got fired from my 4 year job where I never received one write up or been late because of a Snapchat post sent to coworkers. One night I came home drunk and saw a bottle of dilaudid 4mg and put several in my pocket. Few nights later I was sleeping at the hospital and found them, popped them and focused on not dying. Started doing it everyday. Threw away my gf of 5 years, friendships, family, respect, my savings, morals caught cases in and out of Rehab’s and lost my dad, the one guy who helped me no matter what and was so boastful about how his son is no longer a junkie but a better man than he ever imagined. I’m just glad he got to see me clean as long as I was

After trying over and over to get clean, and even getting some Time I gravitate towards it. I feel hopeless. I’m so depressed with nothing going for me. Got a job at a solid spot and fired a week later for being late. People in my life that used to have my on a pedestal of which I was unaware are so disrespectful and hurtful because I hurt them. 

I feel like a bitch but I don’t want to be alive. Every time I get one step forward and get thrown back 4.. been going to meetings but when I’m honest people distance themselves from me.. which I used to do also.. record is stopping me from getting a lot of jobs, school has been on hold.. House is toxic, reputation is ruined as I’m now an abusive woman hater who shoots heroin and smokes meth.. 

I know it all has to do with my relationship to god which is nonexistent right now.. I can’t believe it either cuz I was so close to him and now it’s hard to even pray. I’m under attack and I want to get away.. if it’s not the disease, it’s people, it’s for Finacial stability, to get to a destination.. I know I am fortunate to have a bed, people to fight with, and the legs to get somewhere but fuck don’t mention that shit at my pity party... that’s why I usually don’t invite anyone, so I can complain about being alone ",1520504116.0

I joined the US Navy in 2008 and in 2011  injured my back. My doctor prescribed me 120mg Percocet/day and I was on it for a few months until I was discharged. 
So I'm back in the civilian world and my doctor would not prescribe me more than the 5/300mg percocets. 
So I'm back in school, but can't focus cuz I'm wding, so I find a local connect who hooks me up with 30s for $25per. It started out somewhat tame, but is still at least a 50$/day habit. So I have to come up with a way to make money while going to school... so I start selling a little bit of pot to my friends. Initially eighths, quarters, halves. But as my network grows, so does the volume of pot I move. With the money I'm making, I'm able to buy more and more 30s and I built up quit a tolerance to the point where I was smoking 20-25 blues a day. At that time, I had started selling ounces/qps of coke and I wouldn't sell pot unless it was at least a couple pounds sale. (I would pay drivers 5-10k to drive from CO/WA/CA to CT. They would make deliveries along the way, in Chicago and philly but the bulk of it would come to me for distribution). 
Come 2014, one of my 'friends' says that he's got a local client who wants 10lbs (at this point, I was selling all over New England and as far south as Georgia). This wasn't out of the ordinary, but this client wanted to meet in a mall parking lot. I didn't think anything of it, and went to meet him with the 10lbs. I pull up next to his flashy red Mercedes, take the bags out of my trunk, put it in his, and as I'm doing that, like 6 cars swarm in from everywhere. They box in my car and agents jump out, guns drawn, yelling ""get on the ground"". 
So I got arrested with 10lbs and $40k cash on me and charged with trafficking by the DEA. They seized 2 of my cars, 2 boats, and my apartment. All I had left was 30k cash and a $500/day percocet habit. I made the switch over to heroine, but was still smoking 6 bundles a day and eventually spent all my money. Started doing the grimey junkie shit to my family and friends. Became suicidal, got arrested for simple possession a few times. My family and friends  disowned me. I Tried a few rehabs that put me on subs, but dope had its hooks in me and I kept relapsing... 
about a year ago I entered into a new rehab. Went to this place 3 hours a day 5 days a week, they put me on the vivitrol shot (which works great!), I started doin yoga, and goin back to church/bible study/school/NA/other social activities. 
Tomorrow I'll be 7 months clean. I'm back in school, broke AF, and I'm 30 and living with my parents. I miss the chaos of addiction and the constant rippin and runnin and the adrenaline rush of wheelin and dealin, but I miss it less and less each day. 
Yeah, being sober sucks, but it's better than chasing that unattainable high. I can confidently say that, for today, opiate addiction does not have its hooks in me.

I was on Methadone for about a year and a half and when it came time to get off it I had to spend 2 weeks in a medicated detox unit and a further month at home feeling like death, shitting the bed once a week and getting no sleep.

Since then I've managed to kick maybe a dozen times completely painlessly and without getting back on the old liquid handcuffs, all thanks to lyrica.

When it comes time to get off the gear I leave it as long as possible after my last shot until I start to feel the rattle (though you don't have to if you'd rather have a totally painless transition) and take 300/450mg of Pregab, then again at 6 hour intervals and a benzo or zopiclone to sleep.

About 5-7 days of this is usually enough to get past the worst of it, after that it's the psychological withdrawal and depression you need to fight through but the rattle is mostly over.

When you're on the pregab you honestly don't feel any of the effects of the rattle. The weird speedy feeling you get can be annoying but it's absolutely liveable and worth putting up with since it also keeps you completely functional and WD symptom free.

He’s also the only person that I know can get them.  

Well long story short I’ve been bugging him for a few weeks about finding H in our smallish Southern town an he’s found it. Tonight I’m chilling in bed and it’s been a few days since talking to S and he out of no where hits me up. He had told me he had something serious to tell me and I could only think of a few thing, the plugs got busted, the plug fucked him over with bunk orrr he OD. Low and be hold it was the latter, he had OD. He apparently ran into his old super awesome plug that he’s been talking about for awhile and he couldn’t get his number. 

Well the dude usually has pandas and H and S being a bro bought a G of H because he knew I wanted some. Well he was with his friend after scoring and he decided to sniff some on our local coastal highway and he told that he remembered the come up then waking up at a gas station  on the ground with medics and police. From his friend he knows this, after sniffing he was acting weird, nodding out but holding small conversations while nodded. He noticed S was acting different then how he usually acts on H, pulled into the gas station and told S he was getting him a water, when the guy returned S was slumped and blue in the face so he dragged him out and laid him out on the ground and called the cops. The guy remembered S’s stash and took it out of his pocket before LE arrived, S doesn’t know what happened to the H nor does he care, S told me he only sniffed about .1 no more then .2, but he didn’t think it was even a .1. 

It was his first OD and the medics saved him with narcan. When he called he sounded scared and he told me he doesn’t want to touch it again and he wants to stick to opana. He has a high tolerance, and he was suspecting it was fent. He talked to the dealer and they are decent friends, he said the dealer was shocked and didn’t believe it and that he thought S sniffed atleast over .5 at once until S told him it was .1.

I’ve been using for about a year now and I didn’t start because I wanted to get high. I have chronic daily migraines and have had them since I was very young. After years of Drs visits, scans, medications, operations, injections, whatever you could think of, we hadn’t found a solution. That was until one day it got so bad I had to go to the emergency room. They tried giving me all of the typical meds to no avail, until they came to the dilaudid injection, which worked wonders. That day, for the first time in years I had absolutely 0 pain from my headaches.

I went to my neurologist with this information and they refused to prescribe any type of opiate because I’m too young. We went back to the trial and error of the different meds for about 2 years getting no relief along the way. In those 2 years, I had to go back to the emergency room about 4 times, given the same solution. Also in these 2 years I had lost 5 jobs, all in different fields/lines of work, because I was unable to work with my medical issue.

Because I can’t work with my condition the obvious solution is disability. There’s problems here. 1) The medical community has a very hard time declaring someone under the age of 25 as medically disabled, and 2) A migraine isn’t like back problems, there isn’t an X-ray you can get to tell you, yes, this person is plagued with daily migraines. This is why I started using heroin (well, I started taking pills and when I could no longer afford that, heroin)

Since I started using, I have held a job for 6 months, the longest I ever have, and I’m able to function in day to day life. I still have a migraine every single day, but the H consistently either takes the pain away, or brings it to a level that I can tolerate and still be a functioning member of society. But as we all know, when using opiates long term your tolerance builds. My life is at a point where after I buy my “medicine”, take care of gas and bills, I’m broke, and even then, some months I struggle to keep my heroin supply stocked enough to make it through life. 

I’ve never injected, and told myself I never would, but right now it seems the only option I have to still be able to function, work my job, and live a normal life without being broke all the time is to switch to IV. I’m torn. I know with how bad my condition is I should be able to either get the meds I need for my pain, or be declared disabled because I cannot work any normal job with these migraines (fluorescent lights, computer screens, loud noises, etc, make the pain worse to the point of vomitting, sometimes I even pass out) but due to the condition I have and my age, it just won’t happen, no matter how much I’ve been trying. 

I guess I don’t really have any type of question here, as I know everyone will say that even though it will make my habit cheaper, switching to IV is a bad idea, I just needed somewhere to puke out all of my feelings to some people who understand. Sorry for the long, completely pointless post and thanks for listening to my ramblings. ",1520470899.0

I'll make this as short and simple as possible 

when I was 11 years old my brother got arrested for selling weed, LSD, and cocaine. and I mean heafty amounts. at the time nobody in my family would tell me what was going on because I was so young so I was just told to write him letters once a week and we'd go visit him every so often. this was my brothers first offense and he ended up in a program called shock (I'm from the United States) where's it's basically a crazy boot camp where they whip you into shape and a ton of officers are in charge of it. let me tell you, seeing someone you love being treated like they're not a human because they're a criminal is something will stick in your head ever when you're 11 years old. I can still see the room and the officers screaming at them and the shame in his eyes for doing this to his family he felt horrible. and just the way life goes a couple months after getting out he ended up getting a dwi and getting sent back again.  this of course gave me a great intro as to you know ""drugs are bad kids stay in school"" 

flash forward to about age 13 where I had surrounded myself with kids that were 18+ and almost all drug addicts and/or alcoholics. as the years went on they rubbed off on me and I soon got into coccain, oxys, hydros, acid, molly, shrooms etc. 

flash forward again to age 16 where I was steadily doing like 60mg of oxy(I was 105lb 16y/o female at the time so 60 is kinda a lot) almost every day for something like 6 months. now comes the good part. still 16, still doing drugs, I got my first job with a friend let's call him Dale. Dale got me an interview and I got a job and I had a really good time working there. it had been about 3 months working there and I was dating this kid, let's call him Joe. Joe's dad is a paramedic and I was sleeping over at his house one night. that morning I woke up and my friends had told me Joe's dad was on a call last night for Dale and that had overdosed on heroin( which I found out later that day was sold to him by a co-worker that I proceeded to tell my managers about and she got fired) I called a friend and they told me it was true. I cried all day I was hysterical. I was supposed to go into work but I called in then had to proceed to drive there anyway and explain to my managers what had happened to Dale. I can still see my coworker faces when I told them that he had died. giving people news like that is horrible everyone's hearts sank. he was the nicest sweetest kid ever, always had a smile on his face, always nice to everyone no matter what. and he was gone. and I was the one who had to tell everyone. 

later that night my friend was having her birthday party and I was still a mess. I ended up taking 12 shots(again I was a tiny little girl) and taking an ectasy pill kinda hoping I wouldn't wake up the next morning. my plan failed and I ended up just throwing up on the birthday girl and having her put me to bed. (this part was not necessary at all but kinda funny)

flash forward ONE MORE TIME to about a year into my relationship with Joe. at this point my view on drugs was very fucked up it had seriously fucked me up mentally what drugs had managed to do to all the people I loved I mean at age 16 I knew more kids who had been to jail or rehab or died or whatever is it than most adults do. so anyway. Joe ends up addicted to shooting heroin. I'm not sure where to go with this story considering I'm getting pretty close to present day so all I can really say to wrap this up is drugs and heroin have really fucked up my life and I haven't even directly been the user. it hurts me to see all these people I love end up like this and feeling like I can't do anything about it. like I should have seen the signs I should have known. I know enough about drugs to know that I should have seen it. I should have noticed him at work I should have seen his track marks I should have put the pieces together and done SOMETHING. and now he's gone. and Joe is recovering and on subs right now but heroin addiction is crazy it could take over again as soon as he gets some who knows? 

this story really has no point to it at all but a bunch of people said they read this shit for fun so there ya go. I tried to be quick. thanks for reading 

PS somewhere in there I fucked up the math I'm not still 16 Incase anyone was wondering.... I'm 19 almost 20",1520457359.0

Why is it ok to rx me suboxone which is a terrible drug that is even stronger than the opiates I want and makes me feel like shit, messes with my hormones and god knows what else? What the fuck is the difference ? Opiates have no long term negative effects on your body. Alcohol does. But that’s ok for people to partake in.   I know tolerance goes up but who cares? Then rx me more ! Just like you did with ever other medication I’ve been prescribed in the past. Why is giving me a pill for depression, a pill for anxiety , a pill to wake up and a pill to go to sleep better than one pill that solves all of these issues? Don’t tell me what’s right for me and my body. Don’t tell me how I should feel . I love opiates  and I should be able to take them forever without the negative consequences I face everyday .Before oxy and h I was depressed, had no motivation, and was going through the motions of life. I had no past trauma,had  a great childhood , graduated college, but always felt like I needed more to feel fulfilled and happy .  What normal people felt from the usual things in life that make one happy I never had that. Anti depressants made me numb and a zombie. I wasn’t depressed but I wasn’t happy! I didn’t feel any emotion. I should cry when I’m sad ! And laugh when I’m happy . I was just existing   after taking opiates I finally felt normal . I was happy, I felt good about myself, I was able to get a job enjoy it and hold it down . I was a better daughter, girlfriend and friend. I wasn’t a fucking downer all the time . So tell me how is that bad?   It’s when I couldn’t get the opiates I turned into a worse person than I ever was.  Having to illegally get  what gives me the abilith to feel what other people feel naturally has led me to turn into someone who’s morals and ethics are questionable.  Someone who is forced to be compulsive . I drive faster and harder. I’m always in a rush . I risk getting arrested everyday of my life . I went from never breaking the law to possibly having a felony on my record. I cant keep a job because if I’m sick I can’t go to work.  I’m the definition of wasted potential.

For 6-7 years I've been taking an ~150mg dose of lope daily every 24 hours.  This started after I went cold turkey from methadone from 30mgs to zero but the withdrawals lasted over 2 months.  I was desperate and turned to lope.  I kept at it for fear of the withdrawals returning and without opiates I can last probably a minute during intercourse so I just kept on.  I got comfortable, continued through life, finished grad school, hold a professional job, have wife and kids, life was going along just fine.  Then Costco & Amazon threw a wrench in my plan and are no longer offering loperamide with WalMart probably right around the corner.  I'm considering tapering the lope down and jumping off the train but worried about running out prior to tapering down far enough or getting myself on methadone.  Would appreciate any advice those out there who might have some insight could provide.  Please help, thanks!",1520447653.0

In the building you can use whatever drugs however you want be it injection, snorting, smoke, or even oral use (I think). Oh except for plugging. No butt stuff allowed. 

I went there yesterday as I had some hydromorphone already loaded in a rig and was too sketch to shoot in public like a washroom. I realized that the safe injection site was just a few blocks away so I figured might as well go there instead of trying to shoot in an alley or public bathroom.

I go to the site, introduce myself and basically said why I was there and what I was using. They read me their terms and conditions ect, and after signing a paper one of the workers there brought me into the room for iv use. There was 8 or so booths no one was in there except for another one of the workers. The guy in the injection room gave me a little tray with everything I needed, fresh rig, water, cooker, alcohol wipes and even a Band-Aid too. At this time I was starting to really feel my wd kick in so I decided to add more hydro to the premade shot I made that morning.

So mix, filter, bang, and then sweet oh so sweet relief. Talked to the one of the workers there for a couple minutes then said I had to go cause I was in a bit of a hurry at the time. Went back out to the front desk and they told me they're giving out $5 gift cards for everyone's first time coming to the place.

I also left with some clean supplies too, got some rigs, cookers, water, ect. Overall I thought it was really awesome. The staff there were super friendly too. It was a good experience and I'm glad I decided to check it out instead of shooting in public.

I never had an accident and was always a good driver. Either way, that is neither here nor there.

I picked up a passenger and it was a slow day so he was the only person on a 15 passenger vehicle. I wouldn't do this normally but the only connect I had was about 2, 2/12 hours away and my work required me to go to the city so sometimes I would try to meet a connect while going to the city from the mountains.

I needed to drop the person off near the airport but I ended up taking a 20 minute de tour in the city saying that we had to pick someone up before I dropped them off because it was the only way I was gonna be able to pick up. He was probably around 16 or so, I feel ashamed so don't tell me what a scumbag I was or possibly still am. 

Either way as I arrived to our ""destination"" I told him to hold on for one second as I try to reach the passenger as he is not answering the phone. I walk around the corner from where we are, score, get right back on the bus and make it in time for his drop with no suspicion all while putting my job on the line. I was pleased with myself at the time but looking back at it I regret it.

My first assignment was simply called, ""I Am"" That's the only parameters or guidelines that they gave you for the assignment, so I kind of took it and ran with it.

Hello my captive audience, you are my favorite kind

Like it or not, I'll barrage you with thoughts, about me of my own mind.

Intelligent and bright, self-absorbed; full of might, my folks first born.

Raised dutifully and right, though I am of the left, an attractive young man, his chin a slight cleft.

Forthcoming and relateable, but with beliefs undebateable 

stubborn and cocky, and a tinge ungrateful.

As a boy becomes older his own thoughts become colder, with praise he's adorned, though his self doubt does smolder.

The facade he erects is one to expect: loud yet profound, sarcastic and petty, easy to detect, an image unsteady.

Full of wit, full of shit, silver tongued and dishonest, an aimless inferno, a directionless comet.

Empathetic yet self-serving, a bit undeserving, high thoughts of himself he continues deserting.

Radiant, cerebral, stunning and regal, is the look he projects though self talk is still feeble.

Let us not forget, this man is aware, though erratic and volatile, he has *illustrious* hair.

Persuasive, corrosive, distasteful, explosive

Profane and verbose, loquacious, abrasive, and stoic.

Attentive and memorable, defiant and dependent,

An exterior splendid, yet within still detested.

He can be hypocritical, atypical, forgiving yet cautious; sardonic and raucous, he's seldom literal.

As you hear in this work

His vocab is beserk

His demeanor alert

His ambitions inert

You suppose that there's perks of knowing this twerp

But if you took it from him you wouldn't be sure

He just shows he's a jerk 

And in process of attempting to show him his worth

His self sabotage lurches from the shadows it lurked

You proceed to be hurt

Then it's all over and we both feel like dirt.

What I hope that you learned from this excerpt,

Was a man not understanding of his own self worth.

Because when everyone loves you, but nobody *likes* you,

That is the loneliest feeling on Earth",1520563406.0

I have one I've always wanted to share.

It was around this time of year, 5 years ago. It was my first year into heroin switching from Oxycodone IR 30MG, same story as many. They became too expensive, needed to take too many to get the same experience - heroin was a good ""alternative."" Co-worker was already on the stuff and shot me up for my first taste. My tax return just dropped, I spent $1000 out of the $1800 I got, some on black tar, some on cocaine. I had just picked up from my guy and pulled into the same apartment complex I have always gone to after I picked up and prepped my shot. It was in the back, more empty than usual, I backed up into a parking space so I can see the road/entrance. Somebody must of seen the lighter and what I was doing, or the police saw me pullin. I see headlights, glance ahead, and I see two cop cars speeding right into the complex coming *right* to me. I immediately shoved everything under my bench seat of my two seater 1996 Dodge Dakota, grab my phone and I act like I'm speaking on the phone.

What happened next I've never experienced before. This sense of overwhelming calm came over me as the police officers parked in front of me to block me in and they approach me as I act like I say goodbye and throw the phone on the dashboard, making sure they saw I was on the phone. They came up and asked me what I was doing there so late at night as well as for my insurance and ID. As I'm getting all of it out for them, I explain that I had been fighting with my girlfriend and have been driving around for the past hour trying to clear my head - I was just on the phone with her officer. One officer (who had this very distinct blonde hair) takes my info and goes back to the car to run the info, the other tries to size me up and asks me more questions. Do you guys fight a lot? Where do you live? Do you live with her? I had lucked out so much that my gym bag was in the back of my truck where they clearly saw, I claimed it had some clothes I left over her house when she threw me out - I had just played pickup soccer a few hours previously. All it had was my cleats, water, ball and shorts; but it looked packed full.

The blonde officer comes out of his car and motions for the other officer to join him, I barely hear him but he says, ""He is clean, but before he leaves - ask him if we can search the vehicle."" This entire point I wasn't shaking, my heart was beating steady at the same pace as if I was resting. I just accepted whatever that was going to happen, was. 

He tells me I'm free to leave, but if they can search the car before I go. I take a second and look at in front of me like I'm sad and shrug and shake my head, I tell him, ""Officer, it's been a really long night and I would rather just be on my way home to get some sleep."" He looks at me for two seconds nodding and says , ""Okay, have a good night and drive safe."" Hands me back my ID and Insurance. They leave, and I freak the *fuck* out on the way home. 

That was the last time I ever tried to fix up in a car again. Anybody else want to share some good stories? ",1520561322.0

Don't get me wrong, I love free dope, but when he throws me extra, it makes it impossible to say something the next time when it's short.

As far as dboys go, he's a pretty good one, but occasionally he's short a few points. He always fixes the issue and never questioned me about it. There's nothing worse then barely getting enough money together to pick up some that will barely be enough to last until the next time you get money. Then you get home and realize that your g is a point short. Now, you will run out a day early and be sick. You can't say shit because your last pick-up he threw you an extra 3 points.

Just give me the exact amount I'm paying for, or if you're going to be throwing extra in.... Don't be short the next time! We're dealing with people being sick.

He had a heart attack a few years ago, and has horrible nerve pain /cramps/ spasms in his legs. On top of that he now has either a neck or shoulders problem that he suspects is from lying on his side (which is the only comfortable position for him to be in) that will require a surgery. Understandably his work performance has suffered the past year. Especially when they fired someone, threw him into a new position while expecting him to still do his regular job and learn about a completely new market to him. 

It just bugs the hell out of me because it is one manager who is a complete asshole and is out to get him  ever since he came on board. My dad is as high up as a chem engineer can get in his company and is highly respected for his knowledge in the field. He confided some personal problems with this new asshole, who then used it against him during a performance review. Now hes being forced into retirement, he might get a disability package  but he is completely depressed and doesnt know whats gonna happen next. He is turning 60 this year and doesnt have quite enough for retirement, or at least what he planned on having (mortgage is almost done but not done yet, still paying off a car). He said he would love to get a new job at a different company and tell that to the vice president before he leaves as a big F U. But he likes the VP, its just this one guy. I doubt hes gonna do that, he is in too much pain and not enough energy.

Now its my turn to do what my father did before me and my grandfather did before him... i gptta take some responsibility and figure things out. I am 2 years into my engineering degree but due to fucking around with drugs and a liver treatment i have fallen behind. Still probly another 4 years to my degree. I live with my girlfriend and she is in school too. My brother is kind of a mess up, he went to college but fucked around with coke and also has severe dyslexia. He could never make it through certain courses due to partying + dyslexia so he ended up dropping out and gettinf a+ certified as well as some other IT stuff. But basically the responsibility has fallen mainly on me, the youngest, to figure out who is gonna take care of who. Fuck, i just turned 20 on the 4th but feel like i am 30. 

/rant

Anyways,this is where the opiate part comes into play. Ive been on opiates/dope for 5 years and subs for 2. However my dad is gonna loose his health insurance at the end of the year and ill be unable to afford subs (maybe the doc visits but definetly not subs). I have recently relapsed and been going back and forth unfortunatley. It happened trying to get off subs too fast i think. I was fine all the way down to .125mg, then things got shitty. Anyways my plan was to taper back down to .25 (im on like .5mg and still uncomfortable but after 3-4 days ill be good again) and then just stabilize. Finish the semester out (im in calculus and CANT take that a 3rd time, i NEED it for my other classes) . Then at the beginning of the summer, check in to a detox while i still have insurance and ride the withdrawal demon posession out. That will be my first time in detox so i am not sure what to expect. I really would prefer to avoid rehab as i have heard tons of terrible things about rehabs, primarily that they only make you a craftier addict with more connects. I also am not sure what to expect in terms of payment. Does insurance cover it? I always seem to end up having to pay tons anyways with insurance even tho its supposedly great insurance. This way i can use the supervised detox option and get out of this addiction while i still have insurance. Any thoughts on this plan? I wanted to ride it out myself at the beginning of the summer but i know that i will end up buying dope on day 3 or 4 tops because my will power just gets completely rekt by then.  I figure step one would be to take care of myself and figure out this addiction, then handle this big task of life one step at a time.",1520554354.0

It didn’t take Rickey science to figure out what they were doing.

Whole time you can hear them talking about how the milky the dope is and them shooting each other up and I was just so tempted to ask for a pill connect because they’ve been extremely hard to come by for me, but for some reason I didn’t. After about 4 minutes you can hear 2 people panicking grabbing their shit and zippers closing really fast, one guy yelling “GET HIM UP” and he started smacking him I ran up being nosey and the guys laying there blue, basically lifeless. The one that was yelling tells me there’s nothing they can do and please don’t tell anyone and the other guy just says shut the fuck up stop talking and basically pressured the guy that wanted to help to leave with them. They didn’t even attempt to call the police, they must’ve tried to save him for like 45 seconds.

After they left I called 911 right away, but we were on the 18th floor and the elevators were slow as fuck. Cops took like 20 minutes and this guys blue and I’m slapping him pouring my cold juice on him and I’m pretty sure I’m in a project staircase playing with a corpse... I didn’t wanna believe it, I didn’t wanna stomach the fact this guy died right in front of me... he looked so young about 21 maybe, I never saw this kid but I shed a tear. After the cops and EMS came they instantly said he’s likely DOA after seeing him, they checked for a pulse and shot narcan but he never woke up after talking with the cops while EMTs rolled him into the elevator in a stretcher I left. I’m honestly traumatized, I have a OP 40 right here but I don’t even wanna take it. I honestly feel scarred... oddly enough my friend never came because he got into something with his girlfriend, maybe it was a blessing in disguise

Thank God this will be the last time I'm seeing the woman (I call her Nurse Ratchet a la ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest) who always finds a way to inject ""you're just too young to be on pain meds like this sweetie/honey/darlin' *, we're going to have to start taking your doses down soon"" (no shit I'm too young for this, I'm also too young for this kind of pain). Normally this clinic sends me a text to confirm my appointment, then also calls me to confirm. This month was the same as any other. Got my text Monday and replied that I'd be there, got a call, ignored it. That's my usual monthly routine. 

So this morning when I get up earlier than usual, I decide I'm going to head out to the area of the clinic a bit early, maybe treat myself to an ice cream or something. Get out to my car... and it won't start. Goddammit. Call my insurance agent to make sure they can send someone to jump it, they can, so Joe Smith's Towing**  comes out and tried to get me going. After a few tries he tells me he thinks it might be my fuel pump. According to him, by the sounds my car is making, it's trying its damndest to start but it doesn't sound like any gas is getting to the engine. Fuckity fuck fuck fuck. A few more tries, and I realize I need to call an Uber. 

Uber gets there and I have an uneventful ride. Lovely husband takes the afternoon off so he can meet me at the clinic after my appointment, take me to the pharmacy afterward to fill my script (at this point, really the only positive I've got going for me) and then we can go home and relax. When I get to the clinic and walk in, no one is in the waiting room and they're in the process of rescheduling some dude. That's not a good sign. My turn comes up, and they tell me I need to reschedule for next week. They'll give me a ""bridge script"" to last me until then, as I am completely out of one of my meds. They ""tried calling me both Tuesday and Wednesday"" to let me know Nurse Ratchet wasn't going to be in today but couldn't get a hold of me. 

I have one week's worth of meds, and tonight I am going to be taking a bath with a fancy bath bomb and a glass of wine and anyone who tries to disturb me is going to get their ass kicked to the MOON. At least they didn't completely fuck me over, I guess. A week's worth is better than nothing.

* she always finds a way to call me some absolutely patronizing and frustrating pet name while at the same time attempting to invalidate my pain because of my age. This kind of bullshit is one of the main reasons I'm leaving.

i dont understand how i am supposed to make it into appointments when the last 2 ER doctors refuse to treat me b.c. i am on bupe/suboxone?


theres not much i can do when i am not eating and not sleeping and therefore cannot move to make an appointment . and the last 2 ER visits were connected to the same hospital and they did not spend more than 2 minutes with me total . and gave me ibuprofen . told me to go to pain management . 


I called another emergency room and told them i was on suboxone, this emergencyroom havng a pain clinic and they told me to come in but after having a 2 hour arguement with my parents over the pain, i honestly am uninterested.


I wake up on a dailybasis and pop pills that are giving me fucking ulcers.
i.e. i either take 4 ibuprofen+2 tylenol, meloxicam+tylenol, or diclofenac+acetaminophen+
 suboxone, in combination with a muscle relaxer
and its not putting a dent in my pain
4 different meds at the same time and i am still in extreme pain

oh, and klonopin, too, for the spasms , anxiety and insomnia 


I scream and cry almost everyday in throws of agony .

I may plan to switch to heroin if this doesnt get better. am tired of being in pain & treated like shit .

I would like to be admitted to the hospital but i have afunny feeling unless i fake symptoms that it wont happen unless i go there on the exact minute that i am in serious pain before popping all of these meds. i am zombiefied now . wish i was dead. fuck USA . fuck all of you who get meds and dont need them. waste of a country. fuck the war on drugs and anyone who supports it. fuck you . yes. you.


fuck the police for arresting people rather than treating them

Anyways, the scab just seemed as if it were never going to go away, but I really didn’t pay it any more attention than that. However, the other day I hit the toe, and scab and it hurt incredibly bad. From that point the toe got red around the scab, and began to hurt much more. So about ten minutes ago I started to pick at the scab, and almost immediately it basically popped and started draining fluid out of it. Eventually I got the scab off, and what was left underneath it was just a legit hole in my toe, which is what led me to think abscess. I have never had one though so I am not totally sure if that’s accurate. Also I’m not totally sure on how to treat an open hole in my toe. I just put some Neosporin on it and called it a day.

I order from the DNM once and only once a month. I get very slight withdrawal, basically a cold and some restlessness at night for roughly 3-4 days after that week. Sometimes I only have enough for 3 or 4 days, depends on how quickly I decide to go through it. From the beginning I told myself the first time I break my once a month rule that I would stop doing it completely. I just wanted to clear something up. Chipping doesn’t work when you are immersed in the junkie lifestyle. It doesn’t work if you have already gotten into it deep in the past. It doesn’t work if the friends you hang out with do H. It doesn’t work if H is a primary factor in your life. And it doesn’t work if you even for a second entertain the idea of doing it more often then you initially planned. I don’t think I am any better then anyone else, I really don’t. I just get so frustrated by some of the comments here. I hate that even users here are pushing all the societal stigmas on everyone else. What happened to being responsible for yourself ? Anyone should be able to do anything they want as long as it doesn’t negatively effect others. I don’t care how long and how much you have been using and how deep into the shit hole that is addiction that you’ve gotten, the fact is at some point in time you either didn’t come up with a plan, or you eventually broke your plan. Heroin can complete take over your life, for that reason it should be avoided by most people, I just wish people would take responsibility for it. So much advice is, don’t do it because you will def have it ruin your life. That isn’t harm reduction, and by coming at someone with that advice you are doing more harm then good. If that person decides to try it anyway then it’s already been planted in their head that they are fucked. The most important advice we should be giving is that it creeps up on you, the high seems so benign and harmless, until it’s not. That should be the focus of all harm reduction advice for first timers, let people try it if they want, just focus on making sure they don’t make a habit of it. Of course I don’t advocate using it, I would never recommend someone use, but there are a couple facts that no one wants to admit. You are not addicted after the first or second time you use it. Probably not even after the third or fourth. That’s a FACT,  but no one wants to admit. Also one last thing. People also link being addicted to drugs to stealing and lying and cheating. That’s stuff isn’t a direct result of the drugs, it’s a direct result of not having money ! Doing drugs doesn’t turn you into a morally bankrupt individual, it’s needing to pay for them that does. I am sorry for this long rant, sometimes it’s cathartic to just ramble on and I really appreciate being able to do that here, it means a lot. This isn’t a brag, I’m not trying to come off as condescending, I just think drug use should be judged on an individual basis, case by case. As human beings, we are so much stronger then we know, we have so much more Control then we know, the sooner you realize that and exercise it, the better things will be. ",1520543768.0

And we also talked about that I just sleep all day and I am nevertheless tired all the time. I know that it could come from the dope but I use now since one year and it wasnt as hard as now.

 Its not the noddiness or tiredness from dope its because of sth else. A vitamin test would cost me much so he said we will do that as last chance. 

He prescribed me some citalopram because I cant sleep sometimes. because of the death of my dad and then I think sometimes all the night about many things and in such nights I just sleep about a few hours. So he said he will give me some citalopram for the sleeping problems. 

I should take 1 pill one hour before I go to bed. My question would be is it safe to take that pill and also use my dope? As far as I know its a serotonin blocker aka antidepressiva. I am not depressed. But I was depressed in the past. I will call him next week and tell him that it dont work for me because I want some benzos from him.

What would be the smartest way to do that? I thought about telling him that I am not relaxed before I go to bed and that I think about many things and that I am scarred because of that often. 

About 3 month ago every doctor in my area gave you a script for benzos but I think they started the same thing like they did with opioids. The doctors prescribed them often for many light pain in the past, like one year ago but they stopped that because of the american opioid crisis and they are scarred that things can get rough again in germany. 

In the late 80's we were the number one country for heroin. They smuggled it from here to all european countries because of our law system. 

So much to the back story. Now what they did in the last year they went to all the doctors in the rural areas and informed them aboit the abuse. Because in the rural areas we got many doctors who are in their late 50's-60's and they are used to give you opioids for all injurries. But now they wont give them out so easy as before. I think they made the same thing with benzos too. 

So my two questions are:
1. Is it safe to take citalopram 20mg 1 pill a night and also use my .2 dope before I go to bed?
2. What would be the smartest way to tell my doctor that I want some benzos? I know that asking isnt the right way. Bit maybe if I tell him that I readed much in the internet and that I think that diazepam or alprazolam or clonazepam would help much better. I also will tell him that I get extrmly itchy if I take the citalopram and that I nearly puke everytime plus that my  body circulation  went down extremly and that I nearly broke down. I will tell him that I will definitly not take one more of these pills. I also tell hin that they made everything worse for me. 

Sorry for the long text guys but I needed to get that off of my heart. And unfortunately I didnt got anybody who knows that I use dope.

Well, if I'm taking 2 every 6 hours, that would be 8 per day. I was prescribed 30 on 03/06/18. I dont have my MRI and follow up appointment with the spine surgeon until the 14th. Would it be reasonable to call them tomorrow and tell them that I am about to run out of my prescription for pain medicine and that i have been taking it 2x every 6 hours. I will be running out by Friday evening. That would leave me with nothing for 5 days.  
Im afraid if i call and ask them for another prescription Ill get denied and red flagged or something. I want to tell them that the oxycodone is much better than the norco because of the lack of tylenol, but it seems to wear off a lot quicker casuing me to feel like i was ready to take more shortly before or right at the 6 hour mark",1520536077.0

is the breathing issue normal/gonna subside or should i ask for something different? also is it normal to still feel pain in my broken toe even when its kicked in? im on them for a month and don't wanna feel the pain but i don't wanna ask for more if this os how it works.

They were fun and I never laughed with an old friend as much as I did sober. One thing is the happiness is shorter lived where you feel worse the next day. Sober happiness is sort of spread out.
 I don't know what I am trying to say other than I hope I find something that can make me as giddy and happy as I am with my friends when copping. Nothing is better than when your all excited on the way to score with your running mate. Reminiscing about it with them on the phone and giggling like a kid. I love the adrenaline rush of picking up and the paranoia that you might get booked. 
What can compare in the real world? Sober life just seems dull to the crazy world of using. I love it and I hate it.  I plan on staying clean for a little bit after this bump but it is kind of sad that it made me realize how much I miss certain things about it and forgot how fun being bad can be.
