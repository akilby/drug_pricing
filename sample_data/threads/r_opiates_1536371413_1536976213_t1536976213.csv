I got into opiates when I was 12 years old, graduated to heroin and needles and all that jazz from 13 to 16. After a few overdoses and a forced stay at a mental hospital I got sober the day after Christmas in 2012 after overdosing at my grandparents house. Did the AA/NA Thing for three years, bought into that agenda. I eventually ended up taking a hit off a joint and pretty made that an excuse to go off and shoot meth with some random 35 year old doctor for three days straight. Was gonna kill my self, but an old buddy re introduced my to lsd at a Grateful Dead cover band show and I  had a weird epiphany that the ""once an addict always an addict"" thing was bullshit and proceeded to do psychedelics and smoke bud here and there. Kept up with that for a few years then stopped because of some mild HPPD. I ended up doing some blow and smoking crack a few times but the addiction thing never grabbed me again. I felt invincible so I decided to cop some opana ir 5s that a buddy was selling about 6 months ago and I've been blurring the line between  addiction and chipping ever since. I'm feeling that same sort of mental addiction that I thought I had tripped out of my brain by eating weird RC's. It's starting to affect my relationships and I just started going back to school so for the first time in my life I'm actually doing something positive. I know since I'm not physically addicted I've got an easier than most people, but I'll be goddamned if there's nothing in this whole world I want more than to completely release my self back in to the warm, loving, bitter, evil embrace of heroin again. I'm lying to everyone in my life and it's starting to take it's toll, so naturally I want the drugs more. Something happened the other day that gave me some weird hope though that I thought y'all might dig. My best friend and old roommate was someone I went to out patient therapy with. They were the only other junkie kid in a group of stoners and pill poppers. When they relapsed they were working at a Waffle House. I used to come in and grab coffee and talk their ear off through their shift. Well I was going to go to a meeting that night but at the last minute I decided to take the Waffle House exit. I found them nearly unconscious and vomiting so I called 911 and they saved his life. No other coworkers did that so they might not have made it if I didn't take that exit. A few days ago I bought a pack of rigs and decided to say fuck it and actually do my pandas the right way. As soon as I registered and was about to push down. I get a text and the vibration knocks me out of the vein. It was my buddy, who had since moved to a few hours away texting me to see if shit was good with me. Ended up laughing, squirted the rig in my mouth and called them. It's been a few days since then but I haven't used anything but a few Ativan to get through the cravings. Idk if this belongs in this subreddit or not so feel free to take it down. Just wanted to share what I'd call a junkie Jesus moment for me.

Tdlr, strung out kid gets sober, relapses, does fine for a few years, struggles, friend helps.

usually this plug sells dope that is really white/gray, chalky. quite obviously fent. the rush only lasts like 10 minutes and I start getting dopesick after like 4 hours. but its 40$ for a half g and I was dope sick.

so I went and copped a half g and I am pleasantly surprised to find that its brown!! hell yeah.

but anyways, I mixed some up in the cap of the rig line I always do but its like SUPER foamy.

when I draw it up its hella foamy inside the rig and idk what to do about it.

so far I've been shooting the foam, is that bad?? Isnt it bad for air to be injected in your veins? 

this foam has to be the result of whatever cut my plug put in the dope, because this doesnt usually happen but it has happened before. does anyone know what cut causes it to foam up like this? is it bad for you?

His cheeks collapse around his teeth. The cherry ember glows orange and lights his face. He continues, but now, he speaks words made of smoke.

“Two years is an amazing feat, dude. Really, not many get there if you consider all the people who have ever tried to get sober. Almost none. Be proud of yourself.”

“Thanks. I am,” proud of what? I’m not sure. I just know it’s the right response.

“Call me tomorrow. We really need to get that fifth step done. I wanna see what’s up with your fourth so far. Just let me in on what’s holding you up. Gotta work the steps man. It works if you work it. It won’t if you don’t.”

“Okay. I’ll call you. Maybe we’ll get some coffee. See ya. Thanks again, Jerry.” We hug. He walks off. A blond girl whose nose and chin almost touch follows him to his car. They have something between them.

Another guy I know from the meeting taps me on the shoulder. He says he has tickets for a Mariner’s game next weekend and wants to know if I’d be interested in going. I tell him yes. We exchange numbers and walk our separate ways. I’m pretty sure I’m not going to make it to the game or even see Jerry, tomorrow. Relapse is like suicide. If you really want to kill yourself, you don’t tell anyone. You don’t even let people know it’s a possibility. You just do it.

The house smiles like a Jack-O-Lantern with a crooked mouth in the dark.

It has four apartments. Two upstairs. Two downstairs. Ours is on the bottom left. Through the front door, the hallway smells like pot smoke. It comes from the neighbor girl’s place. Her laugh and the muffled voices of a man in her apartment make me wish I was inside of the apartment with her. OK Computer is playing, song six. Karma Police. *For a minute there, I lost myself. I lost myself.*

The lights are always off at our place. An orange blast of stove light reaches into the living room from the kitchen. Dale sits on the couch with a wet towel over his face. He’s my roommate. Actually, he’s my landlord, because he’s the one who has his name on the lease and only invited me to rent the room to help him pay rent.

“Randy.”

“Dale. How’re ya?”

“Terrible.” He removes the towel. His cheeks are swollen like he has them filled with air.

“What happened?”

He shakes his head. There is hesitation to explain. I imagine he’s embarrassed by whatever happened to get him into this situation.

“Tried to dye my beard last night. Company must have changed the formula. Bad allergic reaction.” Dale is gay. You wouldn’t know that, but he is.

“Whoah.”

“Yeah.” He holds the towel to his face and walks to the sink. He flings the spoon and milk ringed glass I left in the sink that morning at me. It shatters. He screams and curses. There are many unopened prescription bottles in medicine cabinet behind the bathroom mirror. They all have his and other names on them. Lithium. Depakote. Prozac. Celexa.  I never know when one of his episodes is coming on.

Dale wears a clean white t-shirt and shuffles a worn pair of close toed slippers across his afghan rugs. They are propped up on the end of the couch now. His head rests at the other. He grunts and exhales dramatically. I sweep up the glass with the broom and pan and clean the spoon before placing it in the dishwasher. It’s better when I’m in my room. He never bothers me there.

Once I hear his door closes for the night, I sneak out to the front steps for a smoke. Party lights blink in the neighbor’s window. Something’s playing but is softer now and unrecognizable. She’s probably having sex with whoever I heard laughing through the door earlier. I was nothing special to her. That’s okay, though. Neither is she. Well, that’s what I tell myself. I roll the cherry out of my cigarette and flick it toward the street. A raindrop falls on my forehead as I walk back in. I think of Jerry and the fourth step, then Sal and the relapse before I fall asleep.

Dale is up when I come into the kitchen to cook breakfast.

He holds another wet towel to his face and mutters in the dark of the living room and tells me he’s going to the hospital. I nod. He shows me his face. The red lumped cheeks have wept an oily mucus overnight now dried in a green crust on his skin. His mouth is puckered and small from the swelling.

“Yeah. Maybe they can give you a cortisone shot or at least some oral steroids to help with the allergic reaction.”

“Maybe.” Dale says through his teeth.

The door shuts behind him, and he gets into his white Ford Explorer through the front window. I pour a cup of coffee and open the fridge to pull out the can of Spam from the morning before covered in tin foil and a diet Dr. Pepper. This has been my morning routine for months. Black coffee and diet Dr. Pepper while I fry up some Spam.

When I was a kid, we never ate it. Probably because it smells like dog food before it’s cooked, but someone fried it up one time and shared it with me at the halfway house I lived in right after rehab. I never looked back.

Maybe, it’s not healthy to eat so much Spam. I think to myself. A half can every morning. For a moment images of my own ballooned feet retaining water flip through my head while the grease pops in the pan. Then, I begin to tell myself a story. I call it, The Attack of the Spam Babies. It’s about the pandemic of parasitic creatures which evolved from sodium molecules and preservatives in the canned meat product. They incubate themselves like tiny bugs at first just under the host’s skin. A person might confuse them with blisters or mosquito bites for a while, but as they grow, the bumps get as big as grapefruit. Inside, malignant fetuses kick and turn the way babies do, but when they come to term, they crawl out of the human’s mouth and devour them like the giant, hybrid larvae of a wasp or botfly made of Spam. Everyone is infected. The world is being taken over by these creatures. It plays like a low budget, horror/sci-fi flick from the sixties in my mind.

Then, I think about my diet Dr. Pepper and wonder if drinking so much aspartame is as bad for me as they say. I looked it up once. According to the FDA and all peer reviewed studies, aspartame has no negative side effects unless it is consumed in impossibly large quantities. Also, people who have an ailment called phenylketonuria can have problems with it, but belief in aspartame being so unhealthy is believing that the FDA and several other organizations have conspired to falsify the results of the tests, that they are hiding the proof of detrimental side effects for a profit. I wouldn’t put it past them.

I’m no stranger to conspiracy theories. Dale fed me several the first few weeks I lived with him. He might be considered a rightwing nut job. I don’t know, but whatever he is, some of it rubbed off on me. When I called my mom and the old man she’s married to, I would tell them about Pizza Gate or the Kardashian family belonging to the illuminati and how Bruce Jenner’s transition to Caitlyn Jenner tied into all of that. It wasn’t that I believed it as much as I was just sharing the information.

They never appreciated it. My mom had already dragged the old man into paying for my psychotherapy sessions between the ages of 11 and 13. I went because I had become extremely antisocial. Anytime I found myself in a public setting or talking to someone, my mind would automatically blast me with visceral imaginations of whoever was talking to me while they sat on the toilet, like I could smell the way their guts digested their dinner and see their bowel movements in all its different consistencies, black and greasy silt or crumbled chunks of brown clay or painful strings of a slimy yellow snot. I could hear the wet plops and their red-faced groans. It was crippling.

After two years of therapy and 20,000 dollars later, it went away. I just grew out of it. Therapy did nothing. I told my mom and the old man what it was all about after that. They didn’t seem impressed. Years later, when I got out of rehab and started telling them about conspiracy theories over the phone they asked me where I got those ideas. My mom asked me if I wanted to go back to therapy. They wondered if it was just something newly sober addicts went through. I haven’t seen them since they sent me to live with my dad in the city at 15.

Oh, well. I think, chewing my spam now. My shirt is off. There is a paisley shaped blister of bubbled skin on my stomach where grease popped out of the pan yesterday and burned me. I press it with my thumb. Clear liquid leaks out of it and rolls through the hair above my belly button.

“Spam Baby.” I whisper.

Leaves pop with fall of heavy rain drops in the tree out front.

It’s not raining. Not really. It’s not even drizzling, but the day is gray, and there are a few rain drops falling from the sky. I just don’t consider it raining. Others might. Other’s probably do, but one thing’s for certain. I need a raincoat with me in case it does start pouring.

The only raincoat I own is hiding somewhere. I pick through the piles of clothes on one side of my room and fling them against the opposite wall. It’s a form of sifting, and while it makes the room even messier than it was before, it does allow me to find things. Five minutes pass. I’m sweating and breathing hard. Finally, the yellow sleeve of my raincoat shows itself. It is sticking out from under a large plastic bin full of books I’ve read. The creased jacket slides out from underneath the weight of the book bin with a pull of the sleeve. I tie it around my waist as I walk out the front door. It’s raining oustide, now.

Our neighbor’s dryer vent blows hot scents of fabric softener into the driveway. Her husband’s truck leaks motor oil and diesel onto the wet concrete, and I walk through smells of pine bark mulch and fresh raindrops falling in the dirt where their yard had to be dug up for a busted pipe. There is no movement or sound on our block but my footsteps on the asphalt in the pale morning light. At the corner, a man with a black bandaged hand and head gestures and jabs the air declaiming like some diseased prophet.  His eye wanders. It rambles wildly as if it is an autonomous organism with its own distinct intentions and preoccupations, an insect which has bore a hole in the man’s face and made it its home. He yells at me as I pass.

“You have been called, boy! You have been called, but you have not answered! Your time is up. This day will be your death. Hell has place for you yet! Yes! It has place for you yet!”

Fear rolls through my biceps and the insides of my wrists. The fear is that this strange encounter might turn into a physical altercation. I wouldn’t want to hurt him. More than that, though, I don’t want to get hurt or infected with whatever he might have.

He’s crazy. I tell myself. Crazy or not, the words hit me hard. I know exactly what he’s talking about. It’s as if his crazy rambling is not crazy at all but actually the emission of some eternal and infinite intelligence warning me away from the path I’m taking. This is the first time I’ve thought about Sal and the gift he’ll be giving me shortly on the train, if he comes through and if I see him. The decision is death, and I know it. The decision is death, and it’s one I make willfully.

The train ride is cold.

The rain has moistened my shirt and pants enough that the cool insides of Sounder car are miserable. I stare at a mother and her son in the seat across from me. He is a grown man but can’t take care of himself. His face looks to have been smashed by the orifice that squeezed it out decades prior to today. The chin and head are small. Primitive eyebrow ridges call back to the rim of the cratered rock which held the fabled primordial soup, the accidental slop from which all life crawled forth. He spits a chunk of half chewed bread at the window. Strands of saliva stick from his mouth to the glass. He laughs, and his mother coos and clucks rubbing his shoulders like a momma bird soothing her babies in the nest. The scene has made me sick and angry this morning. I decide then that his life is the argument for eugenics and maybe, I’m not as opposed to it as I thought.

Someone slaps my shoulder. It’s Sal. He is shooing me over making sweeping gestures away from himself with the backs of his hands. I scoot over.

“Sah?” He says and swings into the seat. It’s funny to him to say it so absurdly.

“Sup, bro?” I don’t mean to, but I am rubbing my hands.

“Bro! Put your tongue back in your mouth! Haha! You’re looking like a fiend.” I don’t appreciate his comment, but he’s right. Besides that, he’s got the power over me this morning in a baggie in his pocket or wherever he’s holding it. “How ya going to do it?”

“I don’t know.”

“What do you mean you don’t know?”

“Bro. I haven’t thought that far. I’m just going to see it for now. I’ll decide how when I get there.”

“Fair enough.”

“So?”

“So, what?” He laughs.

“Let’s see it!”

“See what?” He laughs again.

“C’mon, man.”

“C’mon, what?”

“Whatever.” I turn away and look out the window. The sky is black. Everything is wet and getting wetter.

“Aight. Aight. Here you go, man. Don’t throw a fit, huh?” He reaches down and tugs on the cuff of his jeans. There’s a square fold of paper in his sock. Sal pulls it out. “You know, I ain’t really one for lying, and I ain’t really one for giving out stuff for free. I was thinking all last night that I should just make you pay for it.” He holds it out. I reach for it, and he pulls it back from me. Sal hands it to me.

I unfold the piece of paper. Inside, there is a wax baggie. It is stamped with the letters D.O.A. in black ink. This is the kind of packaging I have seen pictures of and heard about from a couple I lived with in New Mexico in my twenties. They were from Atlantic City and told stories of the girl turning tricks for tourists she met on the boardwalk. They bought bundles, which were supposed to be ten bags, but they got 11 from their dealer. I always wanted to see what they were talking about and try it. Here it was right in front of me.

“D.O.A?” I ask.

“Dead on arrival.”

“Looks like there’s barely anything in there.” I am accustomed to dime and even nickel sized boogers of black goo stuck to square cut pieces of trash bag in a balloon.

“Yeah, man. That’s what I was asking how you’re gonna do it for. This stuff should be deadly. Better than anything you’ve ever tried.”

“Well, yeah. You said it’s of a brick a bunch of Vietnamese dudes had in an apartment. I mean. They probably don’t get their stuff from some dude of the corner.”

“No. They don’t. They said they get it from an old man. I’m guessing some family or something from back east. I don’t really know, but they ain’t playing around. That’s for sure. Barely speak English, man.”

I nod. We sit in silence a moment.

“I’m prolly gonna snort it. I don’t have a rig.”

He nods. “Get at me, if you want more.”

“How?”

“Facebook.”

“Facebook? I don’t have one.”

“Who doesn’t have Facebook?”

A number of paranoid thoughts enter my mind. Government surveillance and information collection are thoughts for a second. My drug use. My criminal history. Things like that. “Me. I guess.”

“Why not?”

“Dude. A lot of reasons.” I raise my voice. The mother of the disabled son raises her scarfed head to look. Sal and I have been very quiet up to now. “I had it for a few months after I got sober. Made friends with all the people I went to high school with. They’re all doctors and lawyers and have children. I’m living in the back of some psychopath’s apartment paying way too much money with a crappy job and just got sober at 32. I got tired of reading about lonely old ladies’ urinary tract infections and body image issues. You know? I knew them from N.A. and A.A. It was like, why are you posting about this? It looks pathetic. Just like when people post their sad dinner pictures. Are you really that sad and lonely? Are you really posting a picture of the salad you just made and the crusty tortilla you’re about to eat? Wow! I don’t care. A bunch of political propaganda and warnings of supposed pedophile rings using certain ads to lure their victims and all that crap. My mom’s sister-in-law and this crazy hippie chick I met at C.A. meeting once went off, bro, I mean they WENT OFF on each other on one of my posts, arguing about breastfeeding in public and whether that’s acceptable. Dude, my post had nothing to do with that. It’s just like it’s a place where people freak out on each other over nothing or make public announcements about how they’re freaking insane or sad and lonely.”

“Hmm.”  He turns his head to the side as if thinking. His bottom lip is pushed up.

“And get this, yo. Get this! You know what the worst part was, Sal? Guess. Just guess. It was that I was doing all of these same things. Me, bro! I had to get rid of it.” I am screaming. Another passenger laughs at what I’m saying. Sal holds his hands out.

“Aight, bro. Aight. Calm down. Man. You’re tripping out on me. Making a scene.” He laughs a little. “But, look, check it out. I need you to get a hold of me. Search for Sal Emmanuel Garcia. I’m the only on in this city on Facebook with that name. I’ll come right up. Just make an account and get at me. Remember, I just gave that to you so you can tell me what’s up with it. I already know it’s fire, but you gotta keep your end, now.”

“Okay. Sal Emmanuel Garcia. Got it.”

He rides with me for another few stops. We bump knuckles, and he gets off. I look at the baggie once more before folding it back up in the paper and sliding it into the breast pocket of my raincoat. My clothes have dried some. The heater must be on in the car. It’s warmer. I get off in a few stops.

I valet park cars in a garage at one of the hotels downtown.

My boss is a large Samoan with a thyroid gland that is currently trying to kill him by leading his entire endocrine system and vital organs in full blown mutiny against him. He speaks like Eeyore and wears the same khaki pants and blue collared shirt as I do for my uniform. We talk about his divorce and how that’s going.

“She’s still living with me though. It’s awkward.”

“Well, yeah. Didn’t you say she’s sleeping with someone else?”

“Yeah.”

“Is he sleeping with her at your house?”

“Yeah.”

“Why? Dude, you should have more respect for yourself than that.”

“I love her, man.”

“Okay. But that’s not the same thing as having to disrespect yourself.”

“It’s hard to explain. She is struggling financially.”

“Whatever.”

I turn away from him and lean onto the valet kiosk. The things he’s just told me disgust me. Everything about him is ridiculous. The way he talks. His depression. The way he lets his ex-wife use him. I have moved the baggie from the folded piece of paper into my pants pocket and finger it from time to time. A customer walks up. I write the ticket and take the keys. I park the car. I wait at our desk and do it again when the next one comes. Finally, it’s a quarter past four. If I walk back to the desk slowly, this old lady handing me her keys will be the last one for the day.

The inside smells like expensive perfume and new car. It is basically a Toyota Landcruiser, but Lexus’s 2016 version of it with leather interior and beautiful woodgrain panels. Everything is automatic. It has all the bells and whistles. The gold emblem in the steering wheel represents a world of things I don’t understand and never will. My mom does. The old man she’s with buys them for her.

I find a dark corner of level three in the garage. It is quiet. No one is around. I pop open the center console and find an owner’s manual in it. The wax baggie is flimsy in my fingers but stiffens enough when I press the sides to open its mouth. Fuzzy granules fall onto the glossy cover. I can barely see what’s there in the dark. An old Wal Mart gift card with an irrelevant amount of change left on it makes a poor line of the substance. It looks like a much smaller imitation of the smallest ship from the game Battleship or maybe a woodlouse. I roll a dollar bill up and snort it.

The powder burns, even though there’s almost nothing there. My eyes water. A nasty chemical taste hits the back of my tongue. I lean back onto the head rest and breath. My nasal cavity still stings. I can’t tell how long passes, but I am guessing that it is something like a couple of hours by the way my boss is frantically banging on the window.",1536955174.0

The dope quality had been going down for months and i was thinking of quitting due to the fact i couldn't find any real good heroin. Then one day i sniffed a 4 bags and within 20 minutes my heart was RACING. literally close to 300 bpm a minute. My entire body was shaking violently and my vision was blurred to fuck due to my eyeballs shaking too. i told myself if i didn't get better in an hour i would call 911. I was utterly terrified. It did go away in an hour and i was ok.

I have come to the conclusion it was heroin cut with clenbuterol mainly due to this article [http://today.uchc.edu/headlines/2005/aug05/heroin.html](http://today.uchc.edu/headlines/2005/aug05/heroin.html)

It scared me off dope for well over 2 year and now i cant use without worrying about this. Has anyone else come across this? also my buddy who smokes it did not notice these effects. It seems it has to be sniffed or shot. 

The heroin also tasted floral but also bad. kinda like rotten flowers

horrifying. 

any one else have the misfortune of getting this stuff?

I want to thank you all for giving me insight and helping with my questions.

I ended up going cold turkey starting Monday morning this week.

I took clonidine .2mg and 6 loperamide 2mg 4x a day for the first 2 days, then clonidine 3x a day with 4 loperamide on Wednesday. 

On Thursday morning, I took one last clonidine and that was it. 

I slept a LOT.  I was exhausted (I think because of the clonidine), and the dry mouth from the medication was the absolute worst.

But today, I woke up with energy and a new outlook on my future.  I FEEL FUCKING GREAT!

I don't know if I am the norm, but I feel very fortunate that I didn't feel any of the withdrawals like I did years ago when I tried to quit.  I think on Wednesday night I had about an hour in the late night where my legs felt restless, but besides that I didn't cough, sneeze, no runny nose, no yawning, no aching, no headache.  Just tired, and again, I think that was the clonidine.

I am sure that the positive desire to be done with this is also a factor in how I feel.  I have NO DESIRE at all to go back to the way things were.  It was such a wonderful feeling to wake up this morning at 7AM and I was alert and ready to go.  I can't count how long it has been that I would wake up in the morning and drag myself out of bed, just to get out to the garage where I kept my stash of pills so I could get one in my system and feel I could then start the day.

I find that I unconciously still touch my pocket to check to make sure I have a pill there for my day.  I am guessing that that muscle memory will take some time to break, but it sure is great to know that I can take off my pants and not constantly worry that I may have left a pill in there for my wife to find, or, God forbid, a pill falls out of my pocket on the ground for others to see and question.

THE LIE IS OVER!  And I am really looking forward to the new me.

Thank you all again, I will probably still lurk here, and if I can be a strength and help to others, that would be the least I can do.

For those of you out there that are ready.  YOU CAN DO THIS!  Have the positive mental attitude and if you want, use my mantra:

*better every day*

God Bless you all.  And thank you again.",1536940112.0

I decided to hit in the crook of my arm- you know, the inside if the elbow. I don't hit there often, thus that is where my vein Old Faithful lies. I insert the needle, register and everything seems to be going fine. I'm in the vein, no issues yet.

When I pushed the plunger in it felt like I injected fire into my veins. It shot all the way up my forearm and into my hand. I quickly pulled the needle out and started rubbing my burning itchy arm. 

What happened next convinced me my arm was going to need to be lopped off. My forearm, wrist and hand swelled. My hand was the worse. It swelled 3-4times its original size. I couldn't make a fist and the skin was pulled so tight it felt like it was going to rip open. 

What happened? Any ideas? Has this ever happened to anyone else? After 2-3 days my hand went back to normal. I didn't seek medical advice because after a couple of hours the swelling started to go down. It looked almost like an allergic reaction.- like a giant hive.

I'm not allergic to the dope though bc I've shot it before in other veins without an adverse reaction. 

So, any ideas on what happened would be interesting to hear.

TL;DR Did shot, felt like my arm was on fire, hand swelled to giant proportions.

It’s creeping up on the 6 month mark since I quit a very heavy pharma habit. (90mg-300mg Oxy IR per day switched over to a 200mg-400mg per day Morphine habit due to availability and pricing). It feels great to not wake up sick.. and not think about pills every fucking waking moment... this is kind’ve a shit post / update, but really I just wanted to check in and provide some reflections. 

The following are the 3 main reasons why I feel I hopped the opiate train at the perfect time: 

1.) I had switched from Oxy to Morphine due to price and availability of Oxy in my area. 2 months into my quit, my Morphine plug (a 60+ year old cancer patient) passed away. This guy had unlimited morphine at literal unbeaten prices, was always, always home. So that tragedy occurring, undoubtedly was a big factor in preventing my relapse. RIP Unc <3 

2.) The main plug for Oxy in my small town (has been main guy around here for 10 years and running) just got his house raided Sunday, and booked Monday for possessing 2 handguns (1 coming up stolen) with a felony, as well as several other charges. So he’ll be gone for a good while. 

3.) When I was using heavy, I maybe encountered 30 fent presses maybe 2 times in my years of use. Now, everyone I talk to, it seems to be the ONLY blues that are flooding the streets. I’m not saying real blues aren’t obtainable, but I know (at least my area) the presses are more common than real deal blues 10 times to 1. FENTANYL EVERYWHERE. 

At this point, even if I wanted to relapse, I literally have no idea where I’d even look. Besides dark web, which I’m too old school for. Or cold copping shitty fenty dope in the inner city, which I’ve never done dope, and never will. Watched 5 really good friends die, and many others in and out of jail/rehab. So just not my thing. I make great money and could always support my pharma habit. 

 So yeah, I’m glad I’m out, I’m glad I have released the demon. It’s nice looking through the window from the other side. I have a lot of love and respect for (mostly) everyone  and I wish everyone nothing but the utmost success in whatever goals are currently in their sights. Much love, opiate family.

I hesitate to call this hustle a success and if you read this wall of text you'll see why. When I need extra cash I look for odd jobs on Craigslist. My favorite are those that say pay is negotiable. It turns out I'm a stellar salesman and I can get good money for an easy job most of the time. Last week an ad for cleaning with a negotiable pay caught my eye and I met with an old women who needed a whole house cleaned. She said she'd pay me per hour for as long as it took.

Easy money right?

She told me her kid lived in the house and made a big mess. The price is negotiable because her kid was a ""drug user"" and she was positive there were drugs or needles inside. She wanted to be upfront about the safety risk so she was willing to pay more. My junkie brain was thinking what a score not only will I get paid hella cash for cleaning a house but I might find dope.

We agreed on $50 an hour and I started.

I'm not judging anyone for being messy especially when they're strung out. Who can be fucked to clean for free right? I understand, I really do. But fuck man, this was something else. Let me paint a vague picture for you. You guys know wd shits right? Well the toilets in this house had years worth of ass sludge crusted in and around them. I think the porcelain was starting to erode from the constant stream of acidic shits hitting the surface. The fridge was left cracked and the whole inside was molded: green mold, grey mold, foamy mold, I've seen it all. I think if it was left any longer mushrooms would start growing there. The cabinets were brimming with mouse shit, every corner of every room had cobwebs, I needed a face mask to dust. I thought cleaning a house would take me 4 hours but it took me 8. JJ didn't bless me with a stray bag either so by hour 6 I was starting to feel WDs myself. At one point I just finished cleaning the floor and then lost my lunch after smelling the fridge and had to start again. I felt like I was a contestant on a fucked up reality show:

""Junkies Cleaning up After Other Junkies"" idfk

At the end of the day I said sorry to the woman for taking longer than I first guessed but she didn't care. She thought I underestimated the mess to begin with. Then the woman starts crying. She tells me I'm an angel because she couldn't go into the house after her son died in it and didn't know what to do. I start crying too because it hit too close to home. She took that as an invitation to keep talking. My next two hours were spent listening to the woman that reminds me too much of my own mom crying her eyes out about her kid who od'ed.

and I was crying with her.

The successful part is that she paid me for the 8 hours cleaning and the 2 hours talking at $50 an hour. I made $500 for a days work which was a score but fuck me if I ever have to do that again. ",1536903553.0

at the moment I am some sort of chipper amd this time it really works. I ruined my piss test today but otherwise I know what I can tell my Psychologist why I took what I took. The next one is in about 1 or 2 month so I can consume now again.Yay. So atm I rail some lines ams then Inthrow in 20mg of Etizolam. IDK hoe strong it is compared to Diazepam for example. I cant find amything on google too. Its like google deleted everything about drugs. And bing dont work at my phone. IDK why. So maybe you can help me. Its for.relaxing and sleeping. I mean yeah I am really high but IDK if its just from the fire dope or from the fire dope.mixed with etiz. I started to enjoy benzos now. Since I cant use dope.daily anymore. Sadly and good cause otherwise I will be dead im some years and thats not what I want for.me or my family. I lost my dad 2. years ago and I know how hard that was. And I dont want that my mom and bro have to go through that shit again. So which benzos do you take? Also which do you mix with dope? I really like Alprazolam, Diazepam, Clonazepam, Etizolam, oh and I would love to test some rohypnol (flunitrazepam) but thats hard to find. I can get blistered benzos very cheap ans I know that not the right sub for this but r/Benzodiazepins is a joke... so maybe some of you could help me out. I am thankfull for every tip i dont care if its a tip for mixing dope and benzos or sedating benzos oh yeah I mostly enjoy the sedating benzos..Amd I dont take like 10 and black out the maximum are 2 or 3 over the day and max for one week and then I wait a few days so I wont get addicted to them they ahould just help me through my shitty job so I can go there the last few month untill I can get out of there and find a new one. Oh amd the etiz start kicking in now cause Instart nodding from about 100mg of dope nasal plus 20mg of Etiz. So yeah thanks im advance guys. And I will see a psychatrist in the next month who will hopefully give me a script for benzos too against my anxiety ans panic attacks. So thanks in advance fam. Stay safe and please dont write that mixing opis and benzos is risky. I always know that but I will do it. You cant change that. I cant change your habbits too. So love you fam. Stay safe and rememver to have narcan or call 911 for help. Every life matters. I lost 1 friend 2 weeks ago to an OD cause the assholes who were with him just threw him out of the house on the street and then called 911 and it was already to late. They were concerned cause they had paraphenelia. No drugs in the apartment. Such bastards. But karama will catch these assholes too. You can always do more not less so do a test bump/shot before you do your normal dose. I forgot that a week ago too and then I started nodding hard at work and my coworker came over to look for me and I stood up and collapsed and fell dowm and was out forinute or two she carred about me and I told her that it must be my meds and that I am ok. So since then everytime I got new stuff I do a teat bump and if I mix benzos and dope I just do half my dope dose because of the benzos. So enough from my high talking machine. Stay safe. And give me some tips for good benzos and please no RC benzos. Thanks im advance again fam. ",1536869759.0

I started on 4mg a day, then I realized once a day wasn't enough cause I was miserable by my best l next dose. So I took 4 then 2. Then 2 and 2. Then 4 in the morning. Then 3. Then 2. Yesterday at 3am I took my last bit (it was like 2.5-3.5. My friend was sick and had to fly so I cut her off some). My original taper plan involved one more strip, 2 in the morning then 1 in the morning, but the plug isn't picking up. Right now it's been almost 36 hours and I really don't feel that bad. Around 3 am today (bout 24 hours for those keeping track lol) I started to feel sick and I was bracing for a very tough, very long day, but right now I really don't feel too bad. The other day I left my subs at home and slept somewhere else, I woke up 24 hours after last dose and I felt pretty much how I do now, maybe it was a little worse then (this was already a massive improvement over the start of the detox. Day 1 I waited 26 hours and I was fucking dying). My question is if this is my tolerance getting lowered a lot, or just the subs taking longer to wear off? I didn't expect a taper to do much after less than 2 weeks, if this I lower tolerance I might just tell the plug to stick the sub up his ass for telling me ""I got you"" when I asked last night, then ghosting me all night and today.",1536866208.0

I’ve been addicted to codeine kinda full-on for 2 years now. At one point I was on around 400-500mg doses (in one go, every night) but now I cap it to 300mg. Long story short, 2 months ago I developed GERD (basically like acid reflux but worse I think) and I take Zantac/ranitidine and things like ginger tea to help when it hurts after taking my dose.

Recently I’ve been getting a horrible feeling of bloating and dizziness, but not every single time I take my dose. It got so bad the other night I thought I was going to pass out from the dizziness and I was certain I was going into anaphylactic shock because I didn’t take my normal promethazine pill to counteract the itching (instead certrizine this time).

Does anyone have experience with similar side-effects? I understand things like this might be localised to codeine and not other opiates/opioids. The GERD IS probably due to the fact I ALWAYS took it on an empty stomach to maximise effects until I started getting these symptoms. 

Thanks guys, stay safe :)

Earlier this year I came home from my grandmothers funeral, still in my suit to find my wife of 10 years deceased on the couch from an apparent overdose on Pain Medication.   


Addiction has ran in her family forever, through out entire marriage it has been an on-going battle for her to try to control. She has had multiple accidental overdoses through the years and we were lucky that I was always there to save her and get her help, however, this time I wasn't.   


We shared a 10 year old son together, this was one of the hardest things I have ever had to do, was to tell our son that his mother was gone forever. Addiction tears individuals apart and tears families apart, it is something that is very serious.   


I am actually a Film Maker, so after her death I decided to partner with a musician who wrote a song about addiction and create a powerful music video to help raise awareness for addiction. I would like to share that video with you here now and ask that if this video has an impact on you, rather big or small that you share it and hopefully it helps you or someone you know get help.

This question would be better in r/drugs or stims or benzos. But I'm on this sub every day, so I feel more comfortable asking here.

I took a tiny amount of coke tonight (rubbed a little on my gum & took a bump), not sure exactly what time I stopped but I know it was by 11pm (mtn time, not that that matters). For the first time since I started taking stims & benzos like 5 years ago, I forgot I'd just taken stims & took 1/4 of a 1 mg xanax around 12:45 am. Took another 1/4 about 30 seconds before I remembered I took stims that night.

I started purging right away & it looks like I got that second 1/4 out. But I'm not positive, & since I haven't ever made this mistake before I'm a little scared & not sure what to do. For reference I take about 2 mg xanax nightly (I know it's a bad idea to take these every day ftr. I'm slowly working on tapering). I'm 26 & dont think I have any serious heart conditions.

How much danger am I in guys? It wasn't a ton of either drug, so I can't tell whether I should keep purging until my stomach's empty or just ride this out or what..I know this is either a ridiculously dumb post or I made a very stupid mistake, but it is what it is.

Some of the things they tell you to do is to not use any synthetic opiates. I thought this was weird because they do not mention Natural Opiates.

Less toxic than say.. Hydrocodone?

Many opiates are naturally occuring in Opium, but they're all ""bound together"" in one plant. so its still in its natural state when consumed.

Ok so IF I understand all this correctly which is a big if, normal opiate agonists bind to the mu receptor agonize it and then detach and float around in your body and then reattach to another one with varying affinity(strength of attachment).

&#x200B;

<Please note I'm using terms sloppily and paraphrasing, feel free to correct me this is interesting!>

&#x200B;

These two drugs above however will attach to your mu receptors PERMANENTLY, they are never detaching. Sounds awesome right? Well not really since apparently mu receptors can only take so much agonizing until they internalize(get sucked back in and go into hibernation) taking them out of commission.

&#x200B;

So if what I am reading is correct these drugs should provide a powerful high for around 48 hours(narcan wouldn't work BTW!) at which point the mu receptors they are bound to would internalize, possibly leaving you with a near naive low tolerance? Maybe? I'm not sure if human beings, or addicts have ever consumed these, or if its all tests on guinea pig intestinal cells.

A sprinkle of vitamin C powder which had an accident a few weeks ago, leaving it clumpy, dotted throughout with shrapnel like Big Boss after the coma, and somewhere during or between those steps I squirted two randomly-filled-rigs-worth of tap water into the mix, because without water, nothing can occur. That's true for everything in existence. Well, nearly.  
So yeah, strictly speaking I did have another snowball. With so little girl- and thus far I've purposely avoided using these specific American slang words for the drugs simply because I didn't really like them- and a rather large amount of boy, I wondered how much of this snowball I would actually feel.

Shit you’ve had to do to get money/drugs, police encounters, being ripped off, dealing with asshole dealers..whatever. I’ve come to realize other addicts almost always have at least a few good stories haha. 

I’ll start it off with 2-

Me and a friend were both broke so we found some wire to scrap. Took it to the scrapyard and ended up being like $13 short for what we needed so decided to go to Walmart and steal a few of those big heavy gauge extension cords. We get to Walmart, grab a cart and go to the aisle. We weren’t sure exactly how many we needed and didn’t want to end up coming up short again so we figure better to be safe than sorry.  So we choose the longest heavy duty extension cords they had, they were like 100ft and costed $50/$60 each. 
We grab 8 of them, throw them in the cart and come to the conclusion that rather than just push the cart straight out like we already paid, it’d be less sketchy if we put our coats on top of them, he gets in the cart, and I push him out of the store. Well let’s just say our coats didn’t hide them at all and looking back at the situation, that was probably the MOST sketchy way possible haha. 
So anyway, we start heading towards the exit, no greeter/receipt checker so we think we’re good. We get through the first set of doors, about to walk through the second set when I’m pretty sure I hear “Walmart loss prevention” behind me in the quietest voice. I turn around and see this guy who I recognize from the aisle we got the cords from. He was there twice talking on his cell phone but not really looking at anything specific. Once I see him I already know I heard correctly and just keep walking. He says “Excuse me, Walmart loss prevention, please stop” and I of course ignore him. I had parked by the auto section where they do oil changes, so when we got outside I turned and start going down the sidewalk right in front of the store. Loss prevention is still following us but he’s staying back a bit for some reason.. I say “you ready?” to my friend (who’s still in the cart), he just gives me a look which I assumed meant he WAS in fact ready, so I stop short, putting the front of the cart against the garden section fence so it didn’t move as much when he jumped out and I start running, thinking he’s right behind me. Well he wasn’t, I get to the car and hear “wait, wait, don’t leave” and see him still halfway between me and the cart. I start the car, open his door, and put the car in drive ready to takeoff once he gets in. We get away safely, no extension cords but at least we didn’t get arrested. LP stopped following us once we left the cart, I assume their main concern was getting their product back. We figured out another way to get money and after we copped and got high I asked him why it took so long to get to the car.. he says “I had to get our coats” Lmao like bruh, we have loss prevention following us and your first thought after hopping out the cart was to get our coats? Too funny.

This one is quick, just though it was kinda funny-
One time I met my dealer in a Home Depot parking lot. I was sick af and sat there for over an hour waiting. He finally shows up, I get my shit, and go into Home Depot straight to the bathroom. There’s 3 stalls, 2 of which also had someone in them so I decide to wait to get my shot ready. I’m sitting there impatiently for a few minutes when I hear an unmistakable sound, the flicking/opening of stamp bags. I say “it sounds like we all had the same idea” and hear the other 2 people start laughing. I know they’re doing the same thing so I get my shot ready, do it and get out if there.

I've got a Norco scrip for pain which I take as needed. The thing is, sometimes when I'm having a bad day like today (had a medical procedure which did not go well), I feel high and gross before the pain is gone. So I'm sitting here in less pain but not none but not wanting to take more pills.
Is there anything I can do? Like, eat a big meal or something? I usually take on an empty stomach so I don't barf.

EDIT: I've added a TL;DR at the end of the post.

I've been clean of heroin and cocaine for approx two years. I was on methadone initially but really despise the stuff so changed to buprenorthine (we call it subutex of subbies) sometime in 2016..

So i was really keen to detox off the subbies before i start university in (oh my bloody fucking helllll) 5 bloody days. 5 days!! I'm kinda realising as i tyope how bloody soon that is! So i detoxed mid August and have been truly clean for 30 days (I say 'truly' clean as I'm aware that some people consider being on subutex or methadone as not true abstinence; interesting idea to debate as I'm on Quetiapine and Mirtazipine \[sp?\] probably forever. I'd be curious to know who would consider that to negate my abstinence).

Okay, so Iwent to a festival with a mate who likes to drink. I was undecided about about whether or not I'd drink - I was never an alcoholic really, but sadly, I can't be a casual drinker - I can't stop after a few and usually I just end up making a tit of myself. Or worse, I'll start fiending and will do absolutely anything to score (heroin, crack, ketamine or diazepam). My friend was drinking whisky, which is my choice of drink and probably the 'safest' drink for me - as I have in the past been able to have a hot toddy at a family xmas do, or a glass of Glenmorangie with ice and then just call it a day.

I realised that I'm really waffling. To cut a long story short, I scored crack and smack. This was Wednesday afternoon. I had a few pipes and sniffed a little of the gear. Thne I thought, if im going to do this, I'm going to do this properly (I don;t want any excuse tomorrow to score again). Took a taxi to a local pharmacy and bought some pins - online it said that there's a needle exchange in the pharmacy, turns out no, but I was able to buy a couple of pins (20p a pop! Who'da thought it?!)

So I've sorted myself a speedball and I'd really appreciate it if someone would run through some basic harm reduction with me.

To be really clear, i've not used heroin or crack cocaine (or anything) since April 2016. I'm not sober currently, I've smoked a little gear and a few pipes but obviously my tolerance is super low. I have a bunch of buprenorphine left over, is it at all possible that to use that in case of an overdose? I've heard it has naltrexone in it?Of course that would be a total last resort and probably sounds really stupid, but I'd rather deal with instant withdrawal than to OD..

EDIT: Is it possible to purchase naltrexone from a chemist? Headshop?

EDIT: TL;DR:  
I've relapsed but don't want to die tonight. Seeking any harm reduction knowledge or info regarding naloxone in the UK.

EDIT: I've heard of a few overdoses occurring in the UK due to another more potent opiate being in the gear. I can't remember the name of the stuff but there was a Louis Theroux documentary about it in the US somewhere. There's also been a few mentions of it on BBC Radio 4 and I've seen several posters warning of the increased likelihood of overdosing if your skag is laced with this stuff. I'm based in North West England, should I be concerned about this stuff? Also, as I've been clean 2+ years so I don't have a regular guy who I can trust not to give me dodgy gear...",1536801073.0

I really don’t want to go back to that but I did not expect to feel this bad right now especially after just 2 and half weeks.

It's been a minute since I've been on here. Had a little run of clean time, then shit hit the fan IRL and... ""Fuck it"" mode - ENGAGED.

&#x200B;

That out of the way, My connect is a woman that gets fat scripts every month. For years the process goes as follows -

\-1: She gets her script

\-2: I middle for her on a single big deal that moves 2/3 of her product and nets her about $500 and nets me about $300 which I use to pay the power bill.

\-3: As the weeks progress, I get the odd front here and there and I end up owing her about 60-90 bucks when the scripts  run out.

\-4: The following month, she re-ups, we do the single 2/3 deal as per usual and I pay her what I owe her out of my $300.

&#x200B;

This has been the routine since time out of mind. Well this time, she sold her main nut to someone else (historically I've been her only buyer because I'm safe, simple and have only a couple of clients I sell to) and then lied about it saying that the pharmacy was out and had to order the script leaving me calling her \*every\* day asking about whether it's come in yet. Also, me telling MY clients that I'm waiting on the pharmacy when in fact, she had it the whole goddamn time.

&#x200B;

Instead of making this a ludicrously long post the TL;DR is: 

My long term dealer decides to fuck me and sell the bulk of their shit to a shady as fuck third party fucking me out of my cut of the cash, leaving me floundering  and scrambling trying to pay my fucking power bill and then strung me along with a lie.

Obviously certain drugs like benzos or other sedatives that are scheduled narcotics work. However I have been looking for something more accessible and not illegal or requiring a dealer or prescription. I know I could use alcohol but this just makes the methadone feel dirty. 

So far I have tried a variety of otc drugs and supplements with varying results. 
Baking soda an hour before felt like it increased the amount of methadone that was metabolized though not that great. Cats claw seemed to do the same thing at about the same level. Prilosec did this to but was actually noticeably quite effective and I was left with pinned pupils and slight euohoria that I do not usually get from my daily usual dose. Still this experience was lacking for some reason and did not feel adequate enough however. I tried white grapefruit juice and this did seem to heighten the effects slightly as well. Also tried chamomile and this literally knocked me out on the floor and according to my house mates it looked as if I had a minor seizure so never again ( I was coming off benzos around this time though I was doing a careful tamper but this might explain what happened). As for things like soma, tagamet and promethazine I cannot get these in Canada or require a prescription unfortunately. 
This is where I almost gave up. 
I kept reading and a medication  called ophenadrine kept coming up as a drug that is a muscle relaxer and antihistamine that can cause euphoria and according to anecdotal results and studies people reported that when taken with an opiate it increased analgesic effects and ""helped the opiate find the pain better"". 

This is where I got interested and went to a pharmacy I dont usually go to and they had some for a relatively cheap price. I took 200mg and then went to dose my methadone at my clinic ( 75mg). For the 30 minutes that I walked before I got to my clinic I noticeably could tell the spasms I usually get in my calf had subsided and so had my sciatica pain that had been bothering me for days. Oddly I also felt in a much better mood then usual and felt that slight euphoria that people reported about it. 

One hour after dosing my methadone I could feel it coming on alot stronger then usual and noticeably a dull headache I usually get had subsided and methadone alone usually doesn't help this. I had a bong bowl and from here things got really interesting. Heavy sedation and a heavy nod that marijuana does not cause usually happened as I dont feel an interaction between cannabis and methadone ever. The classic opiated feel and almost weightlessness kicked in with feelings of relief and relaxation and clarity that I only seem to feel when I take short acting opiates. 

I Would not recommend potentiating methadone as this is dangerous and obviously the point of maintenance is maintenance and not to get high mixing things that mess with your CNS and can cause heavy respiratory depression ending in death. The reason that I do this is that I have major chronic pain issues and I feel that methadone can actually cover this if I find ways to make it work better and based on doctors and patients notes about orphenadrine increasing analgesia and helping the painkillers I had to try and these people were not kidding. I imagine for increased effects I could do something like take prilosec and ophenadrine but I dont want to add too many things together and obviously create interactions that are dangerous and that cause too much pronounced respiratory depression.",1536776610.0

Though i admit if you have nothing on your mind and you are moving around and being social with nobody snapping at you , with friends, this also can work, but the point is you really gotta calm down . or i do. i noticed the times that opiates have not effected me in the last 10 years are times in which i was being extremely active. for instance, tonight i was rubbing my mothers feet and helping her after her surgery, so i didn't have time to think about it, and i took more buprenorphine than i needed (a little less than 2mg)
I probably only needed 1mg, as yesterday, 0.50mg, had worked quite well, but did not alleviate my pain (as stated in previous post)


I've been using Bupe for 10 years. Im just trying to figure out how to make it work better cuz ive been in very severe chronic pain.


And im not syaing this goes for everyone, but when im relaxed, i really do feel the bupe more, in a euphoric sense, the sense of good well being . i know its not easy for people to achieve this state but idk

thats how i feel

chillin = awesome


being uppidy and doing shit = you aint thinking about it till you realized you mighta taken a bit too much that you maybe didnt even need.

so if you get what im saying, you can make more out of less


i break my 2mg'ers into 4 to 8 pieces, and take small amounts. also, if it goes past A particular time in which i feel like it won't be effective bcause i will be thinking too much or being too active i will hold off. holding off is OK !

They paid five bucks for two twelve-dollar cans of Crew pomade.   Pomade was easy to steal. They paid five bucks for two big cans of instant coffee. A tube of good toothpaste might fetch a dollar, and other smaller items like lip stick or shampoo might get us another buck, so we stole lots. Rufus had a large gym bag he’d bring. I had a bookbag and carried two fabric shopping bags, the reusable kind you get at the front of the store for a couple bucks.

Every morning, we’d do whatever we had left over from the night before, a rinse or some morphine to split and maybe some benzos to take which fueled the kleptomania, which starts with a K and an L like kleptomania. I wondered if that was a coincidence or not, because when I took it, stealing from the stores seemed as inconsequential as dying in a video game. Kleptomania. Klonopin. I don’t know. Someone told me that kleptomania was a legitimate side effect of benzos. It was definitely true that they caused people to steal, but I’d heard that people could get off shoplifting charges if they were prescribed. Sounded cool but also like a lie.

Stealing our subway rides was always a challenge. But it was also like a game. Some transit official might see us coming and batten down the hatches to prevent us from coming, but while they did that, we would go back up to the street level and come in from across the street, jumping over the turnstile or sliding under it. Sometimes, we took the handicapped elevator. There was always a way.

Whenever we got to the strip mall with the stores we were hitting for the day, we’d hide one set of bags somewhere. Inside, Rufus or I would cause a distraction. The other would run through the choice aisles and fill his bags with the goods. Sometimes, we split up to save time and hit stores in a more modest fashion to avoid trouble. Once, I came back to a Safeway to find Rufus being reprimanded by a cop as management suspected him of stealing but when they called the cops, they couldn’t prove it. He laughed when they let him go and watched the cop drive off. Rufus had already been out of the store and stashed the loot in a port-a-potty. At a Walgreen’s once, a young Asian boy who obviously worked at the store was sent to follow me around awkwardly reading through a packet of coupons. I confronted him, but he just stood behind me fake reading through the deals Walgreen’s was offering that week. He made it harder to lift all that I wanted. I only got out with a few cans of Crew that night.

When we got back to the city, we sold our stuff downtown and walked up Pill Hill to get our Dilaudid or morphine. Sometimes, we called Victor and rode the bus to meet him on the other side of town. Sometimes, we went to eat at a soup kitchen where they were giving out free meals, but I always struggled to eat next to the flailing and mentally insane masses in the cafeterias. I always felt like there was feces floating in the air or being flung into my food by the people eating next to me. One night, this kid was walking around the spot where we slept and approached us. He looked like was maybe 19 or 20.

“Hi.” He said.

Rufus and I looked at each other. The kid was way too well dressed to be talking to us. I mean, he was wearing what looked like an expensive pair of tasseled penny loafers with no socks. A sharp pastel pink collar stuck out of a clean Izod sweater. Rufus and I were sitting on a bench pooling tobacco from half smoked cigarettes, so we could reroll it.

“Do you guys know where to get any heroin?” He spoke with a British accent.

Rufus and I looked at each other again, suspiciously this time. A pair of bicycle cops rode by. One made eye contact with me. Was this young procurer one of them? Could he be trusted. Rufus spoke up first.

“Hey, youngster. Why don’t you make the block real quick. Let me and my associate here have a little talk. Come right back. See what we can work out.”

He walked away. Rufus turned to me.

“What do ya think?”

“I mean….”

“He’s got an accent. Probably legit.”

“Yeah. What do we have left?”

“I don’t know maybe a twenty piece. He looks rich.”

“Sure does.”

When the kid came back we told him we’d be happy to part with what we had but wanted 50 for it. It was a scandalous thing to do. 50 was too much. But this wasn’t the time to start pretending that we had morals. Opportunity revealed itself. We would seize it. Everything else was an afterthought and really didn’t matter.

“Sure thing.” He said. “We only have to go to my parent’s flat.”

“Flat?” Rufus asked.

“He means apartment.” I spoke up and turned towards the kid asking. “Say. What’s your name anyway?”

“Edmund.”

“K. Edmund. Let’s get to your flat, sir.” Rufus said in a fake British accent.

We walked for what seemed like an hour, and by the time we got there, Rufus and I were sweaty. The regular stale stench of our clothes used the humidity and heat from our bodies to push an even more pungent aroma of body odor and street into the halls of the apartment building. In the elevator, Edmund turned to us and said,

“We’ll just say you’re my chums from secondary or university.”

“What?” I asked horrified.

“Sounds sweet to me.” Rufus said.

“Listen,” I said, “I don’t think it’s a good idea for us to be telling your parents we’re your friends from secondary or university. In case you haven’t noticed, Edmund, Rufus and I are street people. I don’t think your parents would buy it. Can’t you just go in and come back out real quick with the money?”

“I could, but it will work better if we tell them a story.”

“What kind of story?”

“They’ll be more likely if they see you. We’ll say you are my mates from school. I’ll say you need money for a cab ride home.”

I shook my head. “I don’t know.”

“Trust me. My parents are easy.”

I shook my head again and looked at Rufus. He smiled. His expression seemed indifferent about the idea of going into this kid’s parent’s apartment and telling them an obvious lie so he could get money for us. We walked on nice carpet and by nice tables with vases of flowers on them and looked into the clean mirrors hanging on the wall that Rufus and I never saw in the buildings we visited. There were plugin air fresheners pushing out the warm scents of cinnamon and pumpkin into the hallway. He and I were used to the smell of stale urine and mildew and meth smoke escaping through the cracks under the doors. The hallways of the welfare hotels we knew so well had holes in the walls and unintelligible words scrawled or scratched into the plaster, and the carpet was always ragged and stained. We were very clearly somewhere we didn’t belong.

Edmund opened the door and greeted his mother from there with a shout. His father walked into our field of view from the hallway. He held his head sideways and wore glasses peering over his son’s shoulder to see Rufus and me standing behind him. Edmund turned to us.

“Come in.”

“Edmund,” his father spoke, “Who do you have with you?”

“Some chums from university, Father.” He said it *fah-tha.* It was something like a caricature of a spoiled English boy. Then again, it wasn’t really a caricature. He was a spoiled English boy.

“Tell them to sit down. We’re about to have dinner.” A woman’s voice called from the kitchen, his mother.

We sat down. The parents eyed us. They looked doubtful that we could be his classmates from college. There was a pot of soup and a pan of fried fish next to some plates of vegetables and potatoes. A bottle of wine. Sitting there, it occurred to me that we didn’t know what college this kid went to in the first place. If they asked any questions about that, we were screwed. We’d be outed, if they didn’t recognize that we were impostors already. They should have. It was obvious, but Rufus began to do his thing.

They were enamored. He was calling them by their names, which were Lucy and Harry Brown, like he was their old friend. Another bottle of wine came out. Lucy shouted and laughed at Rufus’s jokes. Harry made his own. Rufus spoke in his fake British accent and had started calling Harry by Harold. At one point, Rufus stood up and took Lucy by the hand for a small waltz around the table. Edmund and I traded looks. Harold clapped and cheered them on, his face red with laughter. They popped another cork on another bottle.

Eventually, the joking and laughing and shouting moved to softer more intimate talking. Lucy swayed from the wine. Harry’s smile bubbled up from inside of himself so that he couldn’t stop. He looked to be speechless. Rufus talked about his crazy life, and Lucy asked him how he met Boom Boom. She nodded to me with her head when she asked.

“Boom Boom? He is my dearest and sweetest friend in this whole miserable life, Lucy. He is.” She swooned. “I was a scoundrel, Lucy. I was a scoundrel and he was good to me.” Rufus made eye contact with me and held it as he said it. I recalled the night I found him talking on the shoe like a phone.

“Tell me. Where does one get a name like Boom Boom?” She asked.

I stared. Rufus took the opportunity to answer.

“You want to know? Sit back, sweet Lucy. I’ll tell you the tale. Harold, I see you’re with us still. Please, listen. Don’t let the wine take you from us yet. This is one I call the Strange Case of the D\*\*\*\*\* Park Hammer. It’s quite the tale, and our beloved Boom Boom is the star.” He spoke in somber tones and held his hand out towards me, palm up, like an announcer introducing the main attraction in a circus freak show.

Rufus could really tell a story. I like to think that I take my inspiration from him. There’s no way though. He was such a natural, and that night, we were all blessed to sit at that dinner table and listen to what a master at his craft. He cleared his throat.

“I am now and was then a scoundrel. As I’ve told you, Boom Boom was very good to me. He treated me with kindness and compassion most never do. We spent every second together after that. These are things you already know, but he went by a different name at the time. One we won’t discuss, as it was one I never liked. No. No. I knew right away that I would have to change his name to one he deserved. The opportunity only had to show itself. And it did a week after we met.

“There was a strange man who showed up one day at our park out of nowhere. The man had obviously been in prison for most of his adult life. He wore a denim button up long sleeve shirt tucked into his jeans. His face was all tattooed up and he walked around showing the back of his palms and his thumbs sticking in. It was the prison walk and posture. You know what I’m talking about, right, Lucy?” She didn’t. Harry was drooling on the table. “Well, he had gotten a reputation around the block for grabbing at one of the girls we knew back then. Her name was Buffy. The guy also robbed several dealers at the park. These were guys we knew, so pretty quickly, he got the nickname the D\*\*\*\*\* Park Hammer. It was a strange case, as I’ve said.

“Enter, Boom Boom. Me and Boom Boom went to the park to sell a bag to a customer. When we got there, the Hammer was already up our buyer’s butt. The transaction was made. We walked away but heard our customer screaming for help before we got to the street. The Hammer was roughing the guy up on the basketball court, and out of nowhere, Boom Boom was on him. I’d tell you, Lucy, about how long the fight lasted, but I can’t rightly call it a fight. It was a knocking out. Boom Boom caught him with one left hook, and just like that, the man who had terrorized the local homeless and addicted population of the area for those few weeks was down for the count. Before we ran, I saw some kind of bloody ooze leaking from the man’s head onto the pavement. Later, I found out from Buffy, our female acquaintance who saw the whole thing, that the man was taken away in an ambulance, but not before the police handcuffed him to the gurney. He’d violated his parole and went back. We never saw him again. But that’s it. That’s the story of how Boom Boom became Boom Boom! The first Boom is the sound of his fist against the face. The next Boom is the sound of his opponent's head hitting the ground.”

Rufus looked up and smiled at me with a gleam in his eye. I smiled back. Lucy clapped her hands and laughed.

“WOW! What a story, Rufus!” She said, “Now, what are the plans for you two?”

“Our plans?” Rufus asked.

“Yes. What does the future hold for the two of you?”

“Hmmmm…. I’ve had dreams of starting my own construction business. Not sure what to call it yet, but our motto will be….” Rufus held his hands out and up in front of him as if framing a distant billboard with them, “Our motto will be, That Should Be Good Enough.”

Lucy clapped again and laughed. “Hahaha! That’s perfect. I love it, Rufus. Gentlemen, it’s been an amazing night. I have to get Harold here to sleep.”

Rufus and I opened our eyes wide and lift our eyebrows at the kid. Edmund needed to get that money from them before they slept. This was his chance.

“Eh.. Mother?” He said.

“Yes, Edmond?”

“The chaps are in need of fare for a taxi home. I promised them we would help.”

“Oh. Of course! Of course! Let me see what I have.” She found a one-hundred-dollar bill in her purse and held it up for us to see. “All I have is a hundred. Will this work?”

It would work. We thanked her and said our good byes. She carried her husband to the back bedroom, and Rufus and I walked out the front door with the kid. It was obvious that he would want change or something more for the money.

“Well?” Edmund said.

“Well, we can take you with us to the store for change or you can walk with us to get something more. It’s late and street dealers don’t work in the city at night. It’ll be an adventure. Are you down?” Rufus said.

“I am.” The kid affirmed. We got in the elevator and hit the button for ground. It might be daylight before we could find anything. We’d let him realize that when it was already too late and he was too invested to back out. No need to spoil the fun before it started.",1536725250.0

What i came away with is that the feelings that Buprenorphine give you override the feeling of pain rather than actually killing it

130mg of DHC was less than 0.50mg of Buprenorphine

Upsides:
12 hour DHC definitely covers you for over 20 hours, you won't feel any withdrawal until the next day, or a few days later.
-----------------------------------------
Buprenorphine gets me high as fuck.



Downsides:
Instant Release DHC will have you wanting more medicine by night-time if taken in the morning


-------------
Buprenorphine doesn't really kill internal pain that well, or my pain is greater than the bupe.

Overall

130mg of dihydrocodeine was found to be a little b it less substantial than 0.50mg of buprenorphine but had a greater painkilling effect than buprenorphine.


The first day i had started with a geater doseage of DHC, 120mg ER and around 30mg IR .

DHC honestly doesnt have as much feeling to it as codeine. but it wasn't unpleasant


Im unsure whether to continue will 0.25 to 0.50mg buprenorphine or continue with 130mg dihydrocodeine.

and like i said, i found the 0.50mg bupe to be far stronger in terms of the actual euphoric effects but nnot in physical effects to actually kill pain. which it should be.

dihydrocodeine alleviated it during one of the worst possible moments


i was also able to use both low dose DHC and Buprenorphine in the same day.

i had learned that you CAN use Bupe and a short-acting opioid in the same day after being indoctrinated in several clinics by high-ranking doctors. so this is not my first time doing this but i also do not recommend it , theres a chance i have bupe built up in my body even if its a small amount to void pwd .but also on doctors note stating that i could take buprenorphine in the same day as taking codeine/dhc/hydrocodone/oxy (NOT oxycontin or longtec or ER)

So anything that is 6-8 hrs and <40mg of hydrocone or so, you should not incur any PWD when inducting into Buprenorphine . 

my assumption is that buprenorphine is so strong that it actually pushes the DHC/Hydrocodone/(short acting opioids) off of the receptors rather than actually fighting them for it and incurring the precipitated withdrawal.



This is basically a shitpost because ill be following up with my doctors . But advice is still appreciative:

1) im not trying to quit opioids, i have no need to quit opioids.
2) i am not looking for opioids, but suggestions on how to kill pain. (no kratom, no NSAIDs {unless its something i have not heard of}, muscle relaxers {pretty much allergic}, no tramadol {makes me loopy}
3) have any of you ever had trigger point injections work for your pain, and actually stay & work? (effect stayed over time?)
i guess lidocaine or botox would be used


Final Thoughts: DHC ER is great if you wanted to quit a long-term Buprenorphine useage while reducing your doseage further than you could reduce it with buprenorphine. It doesnt really get you high. IN the UK / EU they also use it to detox people. It lasts 6 hours instead of 3, and in ER form it lasts 12. ",1536711203.0

I had $6.49 in my bank account and my Netflix payment would be hitting my account at midnight, so I had to get some money to my bank.  Otherwise, I'd get a $35 overdraft charge and Netflix would be shutoff. 

 Church Girl and I had a good time on Sunday (no we didn't fuck you pervs) and I even sprung for breakfast, so maybe she would help. I called her and asked for a ride to the bank and she said yes. When we got to the bank, I had to borrow $10 and she bitched at me ""where is all your money going"", but she coughed up the cash.

Now here is where it gets crazy. Church Girl is getting $10 from her bag and a bottle of pills fell out. I picked it up and read ADDERALL. OMG Church Girl is a speed freak. WTF?

I played dumb and asked her about her medication. She said that  ""the doctor gave her these pills and they helped her at work to be focused and more productive"". I almost cracked-up, but I wanted to see now stupid and naive and ignorant she was, so I didn't say ""damn girl, you're a speed addict"".

I told her that I wanted to be focused and more productive too and could I have some pills. She said that I had to ask my doctor, but she gave me ONE 20mg Adderall. I took that one pill this morning on an empty stomach and washed it down with strong coffee.

Now I have no tolerance to speed, so I was ZOOMING all day at work and people were starting to notice!

So there you have it. Church Girl is a speed freak and she doesn't even know it!!! ",1536704532.0

[https://www.hindawi.com/journals/isrn/2012/104975/](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/isrn/2012/104975/)

In the study - the regent of liquid codeine solution was microwaved with a 450w microwave at 20C for 5 minutes with activated charcol as a regent. Apprantly the microwave radiation hydrodinizes the codeine into dihydrocodeine with stunning yields, which can be further converted to HYDROCODONE

Would this experiment work in low yields at home conditions? I haven't studied chemistry to any  huge degree, was just a part of my biology bachelors, so i'm not really knowledgable about the terms and conditions used in this experiment.

&#x200B;

Regardless - i have a 450w microwave, and i'm gonna try microwaving the liquid solution for 6 minutes at 20C to see the results (since i have bigger ammounts of codeine solution)

EDIT: probably not gonna work, ""2.5 g codeine was suspended in water (30 mL) and acetic acid was added until codeine dissolved (1 mL). pH of codeine solution was recorded at 4.75. 0.20 g Pt on activated charcoal catalyst (1% Pt/C) was added to solution. This solution was put into a CEM discover microwave reactor (CEM Corporation, Matthews, NC). The upper part of the reactor was filled with inert nitrogen gas by passing nitrogen gas and the addition of H2 to the system is started. The initial hydrogen pressure was set as 5 psi in all experiments. H2gas was deflated giving the reactor nitrogen gas.""

I don't really have Nitrogen gas reserves at home, and no microwave that can set pressure levels for hydrogen absorbtion. Thought it has something to do with Hydrogen from Water connecting to codeine... eh, well, gonna try for anecdotal science",1536670476.0

9ewuza,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9ewuza/im_in_icu/,16,https://redd.it/9ewuza,dori_88,I'm in ICU,"Early Monday morning around 2am I got up to go get a glass of water downstairs, because i had a night terror and was really in pain. Even I  was convinced it was just anxiety. 

When reaching for a glass to pour the water i tuned my head and stretched a bit to get the glass. Never got it because when made that  movement my whole neck cracked followed by a loud pop.

So, outside I went to get air.  I found myself sitting on the backyard patio dizzy with severe shooting pains and classic problems like tingling and full blown nausea.  Pain sky rocketed from 2 to 8 in 30 minutes the dizziness was so bad i called 911. I simply couldn't stand up. I was too afraid of falling than anything else. 

So paramedics came in the back gate and transported me to the hospital because that 8 jumped to yikes the second they did that bp was also 145/108 with 110 pain rate.  

The ER doctor was an asshole and wouldn't give me anything addictive including benadryl iv and insisted on a 2nd CT Scan that showed no changes according to him and that I just had a pinched nerve.  I countered with, ""well, why does my neurosurgeon say the screws are loose upon his evacuation of the CT?"" The ER doctor was arrogant and said he must've looked at it wrong because he might've been rushing.  

So he was more than happy to call my neurosurgeon at 6am to evaluate it carefully to calm my nerves but went off shift at 7am. 

Well he calls the neurosurgeon at 6am by this time its been 5hrs and I've recieved oral flexril and an IM benadryl shot. 

Without an IV at 6am the neurosurgeon said i needed an admission so neurosurgeon could be down there and see me/evaluate my 2 CTs and MRI. The ER doc was reluctant to admit me and told me I'd likely go home after the neurosurgeon determined it wasn't serious. 

I almost believed him and almost took him up on the offer to discharge me at that very moment where u could follow up outpatient. I didn't though because by the grace of my higher power my neurosurgeon was going to already be doing  surgeries at the hospital I was at.  So I stuck around to get the MRI read and and calm my anxiety so that i could go home with peace of mind and throw out my flexeril. 

I spent 8hours in tears, but remained calm convinced it was all an 8hr long panic attack. The ER doc went off shift. A new ER doctor came in and just reinforced the original ER doctor's sentiments.

Finally, 10 hours later the neurosurgeon arrives and cofims that I indeed DO HAVE LOOSE SCREWS and ontop of that the whole plate is shifted causing c5 where a spacer is starting to herinate and is punching my spinal column likely causing my severe pain.  He put me on his Operating Schedule for the day ordered me a 1mg dilaudid shot and then 3hours later I underwent major surgery.  

I am currently hospitalized in the ICU following surgery and have been pushing the narcotics off as much as possible. Dilaudid is ordered every 4hrs. I've had opportunities for 4 doses. Due to the medical necessity I am still  43 sober as of today.  

I've been reaching out taking each problem at a time as well as not future tripping. Im also proud for staying calm in the ER and leaving it to my higher power.",1536666878.0
9ewuod,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9ewuod/like_a_freight_train_i_heard_in_the_distance_i/,23,https://redd.it/9ewuod,Adamdkc,"Like a freight train I heard in the distance, I never saw the the tracks I was standing on.","It's hard to pinpoint where this all started. I grew up between 2 houses, parents who divorced before I knew what marriage was. My dad was successful and lived down south in the islands with his former lover and new wife. He only got to see me every other holiday, and some random weekends he would pick me up from the private school he paid for and my mother taught at.

My mom was a paranoid schizophrenic who loved her son as much as she could, given her condition. I had anger issues growing up. Not the kind to predetermine a serial killer or anything, I was just a little confused about why my mother cried at night over the phone to my aunt about the rent and why my dad just bought a new boat. I  guess I didn't understand why two people raising a child together couldn't help one another financially. 

As I got older, i understood that my father paid child support and that Christmas at his house was a literal wonderland. I also began to understand that my father left my mother for the woman who lives in his house, and it ruined her.  

 Before the private school she taught at, my mom hopped around our state a lot, going to school and racking up debt. She was a genius in her own right, but she changed universities quite often pursuing different degrees. One year we found ourselves living in an RV in my aunt's yard. My aunt, who would be my mother's sister, had a son named Daryl. Daryl was a few years older than me, and aside from the common hazing boys give one another, he was always kind to me. I thought it was fantastic, as I could spend as much time with Daryl and his older friends as possible. I couldn't stop thinking about my cool older cousin introducing me to his neighborhood friends. 

The neighborhood happened to be a very rough part of the general Miami metro area called the Wick. As young as I was, I idolized Daryl and his friends. When Daryl got caught drinking schnapps  with our next door neighbor, I snuck a swig while he was being berated in the next room. I thought the shit was disgusting, but I told Daryl about it the second we were alone.

Daryl always did his best to keep me away from his life style and the shit his friends would get into. Later that year my mom and I moved away after she discovered some kind of medical needles under my aunt's bed, and Daryl was arrested for running around the neighborhood naked after drinking some tea he made with some flowers he knew where to find.

Over the years, we would visit on holidays and Daryl would share his weed with me. He was shocked when his 12 year old cousin asked to find him some bud, but he obliged. The stories passed around the family about Daryl got worse over the years, gang mischief, prison for drug trafficking. For some reason, I never felt negativity about the situations. I was always mildly intrigued.

Years go by, and sometime in there my mother takes the easy way out. She decided to stick a garden hose in the tail pipe of our family van, and shove the other end into her car window. Left with one parent I hardly knew and a rebellious attitude, I headed off to an island of rich white folk, where drugs weren't really sold as much as just there. I wasn't really welcome there, i had grown up in a larger area that had a heavy music scene, and I thought that was all the rage.  I met a few kids who got into it as well, and shortly after I had my group.

 In our early years of high school, acid and weed were all the rage for us.  We tripped every weekend, and we always wanted to push it harder than we had previously. If I were forced to pinpoint a time in my life that I should have been alarmed about my interest in drugs and escaping reality, it would be the time my friend Jeff's girlfriend gave me some of her mother's pain meds she didn't take from her cancer prognosis. 

""I can get you this stuff whenever dude. It's not really my thing and my mom is into the whole holistic medicine stuff. Just give me 20 bucks every time i give you a bottle and we'll be square.""

Every time I took the things they made me puke, but afterwards it was bliss. I realized I had to share this with my fellow students, and at age 15 I started moving MS Contin to kids at parties. I had never heard the word opiate before, or seen heroin outside of D.A.R.E., and the idea that these pills Alexa was supplying me with to sell were addictive is something I didnt understand until almost a decade later.

I eventually left that island and went on to my own life, joining the army at 19, discovering painkillers as I know them now around the same time via some army buddies, and some civilian buddies from a college town I lived in before the service. I served my time honorably, drinking whenever possible as infantryman do, and deploying as infantryman also do. I ended my service honorably, with a divorce under my belt and a few Purple Hearts, along with a 70% disability rating from the PTSD I was told I suffered from. I never took the meds, the depression ones made me cold and the insomnia ones made me dead. Instead I found cocaine, and popularity in the waterfront city I moved to after I got out.

Since I have joined this (wonderful) community, there have been a few questions that have cropped up repeatedly both in threads I’ve posted in & also as DMs. 

Most of them run along the lines of “who are you and what are you doing here?”, “do you even use opiates?”,   “are you a REAL doctor” & “who the fuck do you think you are” etc

I don’t presume that the vast majority of you give a shit, but in order to address a few things, I thought I’d write a post for this of you who actually care. 

I don’t wish to be “credentialed” by the (beautiful, generous and kind) moderators or any of that shit. I’m human, I make mistakes & I’m just an average joe, making my way in the world. 

This is not an AMA & under NO circumstances will I give even remotely identifying information. I live in Australia, I have the cliched wife & 2.3 children. I am a chronic pain patient (have been for approx a decade) who also happens to be  a doctor. YES an actual medical doctor (MBBS)

Not a Doctor of Feminist Interpretive Dance or some shit 💃 

I will not provide medical advice. However if someone posts up “I’m sweating really heavily, can’t breathe, my chest feels really heavy, there’s a shooting pain in my left arm & I have an impending sense of doom”, then I reserve my right (as a human being, not a doctor) to tell you in the most vociferous terms possible, to go see YOUR doctor or the professionals at the ER as soon as possible. 

I thought some of you may find my perspective on some things interesting as I am both a long term chronic pain patient & also treat & prescribe opioids for, patients on a regular basis. 

List of answers to common questions:

• I’m on here for personal reasons. I do NOT represent anyone else or any institution. I thought I may be able to provide some insight from both a “patient” & “prescriber” viewpoint. 

• I’m a smart ass sometimes because it’s my nature to be whimsical (when I’m not on the clock so to speak) and I do try to temper my smart assery with at least SOME decent info.

• Yes I’m a doctor. Yes. A “real” one. Yes. Yes the one who prescribes drugs. No I will not prescribe YOU drugs (who knows, if you live in Australia, maybe at some point I HAVE prescribed you drugs..what a mind fuck huh?). 

• Late thirties (40 is fast approaching 😒)

• Yes I have Narcolepsy. Yes I take drugs for said Narcolepsy. No it does not affect my ability to work. 

• PLEASE don’t message me asking “how do I convince my Doc to prescribe me X/Y/Z drug(s)”. Not to be rude, but I won’t respond. You’ll either figure it out or you won’t. 

• I’m NOT your doctor. Questions asking for diagnoses will be sent a generic “see your doctor if it concerns you” type response. 

Now, WHY am I prescribed painkillers and why have I been on them for the best part of a decade? (None of this provides personally identifying info and no it didn’t make the papers). 

I’ve ridden motorcycles for years. Since I was 5. Sports bikes are (one of) my passions. 

I was involved in a high speed accident some years ago, when I say high speed I say in the vicinity of 190km/hr (not sure MPH, you can google it) on a public road not a track. We know this because I was wearing a GoPro. No I was not charged as it was an accident. 

I fell asleep. I woke up in a ditch. Everything hurt. I nearly died. My injuries were/are as follows for those interested:

• Unstable C5/C6 cervical fractures. Stable T1/T2 unstable L4 fractures. 

• Broken radius/ulna

• Dislocated shoulder

• 4 Broken ribs & fractured sternum

• Broken scapula (doc was VERY impressed with that one).

• Broken femur & clavicle. 

•Conncussion & mild TBI.

• Variois soft tissue injuries.

Oh and a unilateral tension pneumothorax. 

Multiple surgeries blah blah. 

But that’s a snapshot of why I’m here, why I’m prescribed painkillers & all that shit. 

Anyway, thanks for reading and if you made it this far, you get a good star ⭐️

P.s I’ll post some “pill porn” when I get home from my latest script.

I am on 40+ mg of oxy a day and I have lost my doctor and all the other doctors here want me to use medical cannabis for my pain but it doesn’t work 100% and is very expensive and I have had a financial change and can’t afford to spend my rent money on cannabis. 

I am hoping I can get some prescriptions for a few months until I can get this under control but so far my only option is to basically go broke and withdraw from oxy and use cannabis aggressively and try and taper off the oxy. 

Now the problem and the reason for the post. I am getting almost suicidal trying to manage without oxy, yet when I take it everything is dandy and it’s helpful but costly to smoke bud and I can use less opioid, so maybe I can stretch things but I worry about the day I have no oxy and am sick and in pain and suicidal. I know we have methadone clinics nearby that I can self refer to, however I can’t use methadone and cannabis and don’t know what methadone is like. I don’t want to buy pills off dealers as I don’t actually want to die and I obviously am not ready for heroin if I don’t want pills and don’t like spending money on weed. 

Does anyone think methadone would help pain and put me in a mental place I can survive? Is it free? I found Kratom at a head shop but don’t trust it because it’s not regulated/tested and as I said am trying to find a way to live without endangering my life. ",1536640278.0

I mean sure occasionally I will find someone selling a few percs and once I was able to buy a very obviously pressed blue 30mg oxy. But overall hydromorphone is the most widely available and used opiate. Every other daily user I've met uses hydromorphone. Even when I was in a car accident at The age of 18 I was written a script for hydromorphone both in the ER and later by my doctor. It seems like it is the go to choice for almost every doctor when writing a prescription as every person I know with a regular opioid prescription is getting hydromorph contin. This really confuses me as it seems like one of the easiest and most rewarding opioids to abuse. I mean they are just these capsule full of extended release beads and they are so easy to crush, not to mention every pharmacy sells pill crushers that make easy work of breaking them down. 

  With the opioid epidemic being such a hot button issue right now it seems odd that doctors will right off the hop write a prescription for one of the most easy to abuse opioids with the largest jump between oral and IV Bioavalibility. Hell the fact that I can only really get hydromorph reliably is the only reason I started to shoot in the first place as I have no problem snorting heroin and popping oxy when I order them online as the smaller jump in potency just doesn't justify the risk for me in the same way hydromorph does. Not to mention the fucking amazing rush you get from shooting hydromorph where as when snorted or plugged it is honestly a pretty average opioid. 

   The last thing I wanted to mention was the price, on the street a 6mg cap will usually go for 20$ and they are always very easy to find at that price however if you get a good connect it isn't too hard to find a 4mg pill for 10$ or even a 6mg for that price. So looking at those prices you can easily see how snorting them really isn't very affordable as they are obviously priced based on the IV dosage.",1536639895.0

What are you guys talking about? As far as I am aware there are at least in the USA state RX databases, and in countries with free government healthcare yea there are permanent computer records. Doctors or hospitals keep records on you, but you have to agree to transfer these or even carry them yourself to the new physician.

But even the state RX databases often only go back so many years, its not lifetime.

&#x200B;

Pick up and leave the state, or wait out the database, go to new doctor and just make some excuse for why you cannot get your old records. Lie and say you have dual citizenship and just got back from a decade abroad etc.

1. How would he find what is in an Oxycodone? He thinks there is oxycodone, but he is trying to find what fillers are added to it.

a. He would also like to find the (not sure how to say this properly) what dissolves what in the makeup.

b. He has used 93% grain Alcohol to dissolve 10mg Ritalin IR, powdered, dissolved, filtered and let air dry until it is a dry power. It packs a punch, but his yield is only about 40%. He was thinking maybe he did not let it dissolve long enough? Any other idea?

2) If he uses the same process on the Oxycodone.

a. Would you use 93% grain alcohol or just water (like CWE) to dissolve?

b. Do you think the product would be a better snort that just crushed? Could you base it?

I’ve been in chronic pain and the nurse that was explaining the surgical procedure said “you’re going to get pain medication but they won’t refill it; so don’t ask.” I’m not sure if she was talking about the pharmacy or my doctor. Either way, I’m worried I won’t get a refill, my pain is super intense and apart from my situation there’s so many people that will be affected one doctors cease perceiving them medications. Also, prescription pain killers overdoses are extremely low; it’s mainly heroin and usually those who overdose on pain medication have never been prescribed said medications, other times they’re mixed with other drugs. I think these new restrictions is only going to pave the way for a clandestine market and there will be more fatalities that way. What do you guys think? ",1536600741.0

Tomorrow I have to get on a plane to go visit my girlfriends sister. It won't be a long flight and it is not international. We are leaving from the Baltimore airport.


I have a little over a g of dope that I am gonna have to stretch to keep me well out there. I am trying to figure out how to get this past the airport security. We are only bringing carry on bags. Normally when I go anywhere with my dope, I keep it in a crotch pocket. For those of you who don't know, a crotch pocket is made by cutting a horizontal slit in the flap of fabric that is behind the crotch zipper on pants/jeans. You just tuck your shit down there, zip your pants up, and you are good to go. I was planning on doing this until I found out about the full body scanner thing. It's got me a bit worried. I haven't been shooting my dope the last several months (trying to ultimately cut back and quit) and have just been sniffing it, so I don't need to worry about rigs. 



Does any one have any tips or insight as to how i may be able to pull this off? I have no connections where I am traveling to so I kind of need to bring or else be in nasty withdrawals the entire time I am there.


Any help would be appreciated.



Thanks!

I hope you all are having a happy day and may the Cosmic Opiate Overlords bless you all with safe travels, pinned pupils, and a bountiful collection of powdered heaven. 👍🤖






EDIT#2: Just a little update. I am at the airport and made it through security. They did in fact have the body scanner. I went with ""put my dope in capsules method"". I had a bottle of 5-HTP vitamins, and the powder with in the capsules was almost identical in color to my dope (light brown). Mixed 3 dope capsules in with the other 15 or so caps of 5-HTP left in the bottle. For good measure I brought two other bottles of different vitamins. I put all three bottles in my carry, and the people scanning the bag didn't even give it a second thought. Suffice to say, this method works very well. 10/10, would recommend.",1536590378.0

Any accounts like this created after then is automatically in violation once we catch it, and will be PMed by one of the mods asked to come back with a different name and banned. These kind of usernames are causing problems for multiple reasons. 

Older accounts in violation that have established karma/post history here may be granted an exception at mod discretion, but for the most part any names like this will not be permitted go post here even if no rules have been broken yet. 


The types of names not allowed and the reasons they are not allowed should be obvious, but here is clarification: 

-examples not allowed: this includes usernames (that are often created with rulebreaking intentions) such as: obvious ones like ""dopesickinXcity"", ""needHinATL"", ""LAoxyplug"" etc; and some less obvious but still not OK names that include area codes, zip codes, etc. or usernames that arent location based but are along the lines of ""PMmeforheroin"" etc. that are clearly intending to source here. Names with just a state in them may be granted an exception at mod-discretion. 

- reasons for this rule: 1) they are often obvious with intentions to break rules 2) they invite potential sourcing from others near you 3) they very often end up leading to location discussion and comments that violate our sourcing, location, or meetup policies and put the entire sub at risk.

At first I didn't.. I hope I feel differently when I awake or at least not so fucking bad about it. 


Basically, yesterday (Saturday) Cliff rang my doorbell. I opted not answer the door, despite it being obvious ppl were home.. I mean like the fucking front window was open. Unless he didn't look up, it was quite obvious.

I didn't know what to do when he rang but I didn't want to come to the door. I hate being at a disadvantage as he's the type to say ""I have an emergency"" and many times I've regretted availing myself for ""emergencies"", or at least realized they were not emergencies either way. Sometimes not even all to inconvenient.


Well whatever, I could go all day. This is is the exact thought which makes me well up with sadness...


#The other day...

Cliff rang my doorbell, I didn't respond. I ran to grab a towel to pretend I was in the shower so that I could say ""I'll swing by to talk later"" and so he wouldn't enter my house with is bed bugs. Then I decided not to bother answering because I didn't want to bother visiting his house to find out some bullshit. well actually, I was on the fence. I texted that I had work and would swing by before work.

&nbsp;
**I checked the front door surveillance camera, and he was standing there..**  I still didn't know what I wanted to do, I just wanted it to end. I checked again and he stood in my driveway a few seconds. Then I texted that I'd swing by around 4pm and he didn't respond... maybe he got the message, maybe his phone was shot.

&nbsp;

Goddamit I feel so awful about this even though the preponderance of history says I really shouldn't. I should be continuing to rejoice that I haven't been dope-sick and that I haven't gotten shafted into pissing way money. 

&nbsp;

I set a reminder to try and make amends tomorrow... at least drop him off a replacement power cord for his computer even though he's a careless slob. I want to do something right to offset the guilt I feel but nothing more as such wouldn't be in my interests. ughhhhh...fuck fuck fuck. This is so fucking paradoxical.

I feel so bad just assuming he's up to no good, or up to something that will annoy the shit out of me but what if he just wanted to check in as a friend? I mean probably not but goddamit I'm in a thought loop. Until I go to find out I wont know either way and will be burdened with guild. Yet it's probably more logical just to push through the guilt and to move on while I can because being cordial might get pounced on.

Kratom? A wonderful plant that, at least works for me. The only downside is the fact that it may get banned?

CBD Oil? The relaxing and pain relieving effects is has on a lot of people don't work for me. It's the non-psychoactive chemicals in cannabis.

I’m talking about the ones that are usually $4-$5 each and then stamped with whatever the dealer is using at the moment. In my area you can buy thousands of empty ones, for super cheap, just from a regular convenience store in the ghetto. All you need to do after buying them is fill with dope, fold, tape, and stamp. My brother and I are torn on the subject on whether they are made for one use only, bagging heroin... or if they have to be made for something else because there is no way they could be manufactured legally. Are they manufactured in a factory or is it in like a little underground business? I just don’t get how they could be sold to these convenience stores. Like would the seller say, “Hello sir, would you like to buy thousands of wax fold bags for your store?” “What is the use for them and who would buy them? “Drug dealers buy them and they are used for heroin” HAHAHA! Are the store owners in on it or something?! Do they say they have another use? But who would buy thousands of them and what guise would they think they would sell as? LOL You see what I mean? I’m assuming sellers of the bags sell to the same convenience stores you can buy crack pipes so they already know the owners are cool with paraphernalia, but I know regular stores that still sell the wax folds, but no other “illegal” things. Maybe are they manufactured legally as like large wax sheets and then certain people just buy that and then make them into the small drug bags with a little machine and some glue? I just can’t even imagine what they could even be used for besides bagging dope. It obviously is illegal to manufacture at a large scale, distribute, and sell as wax bags used for heroin. I know this has probably a really simple explanation but it is bothering my brother and I so much that we don’t have a definite answer, so if anyone has any information on my questions I’d really appreciate it! I barely found any answers on Google so I knew if I came here on this subreddit I would definitely find some people that knew the answer! I have been arrested for drug paraphernalia for just having plain, empty bags with no residue which makes me believe they don’t have another use. At least with marijuana dime bags, the ones with the little zip-loc top, are commonly used for extra buttons when you buy a shirt or for jewelry (earrings or extra charms).

In that span of time I've had some clean time.. sum total of about <5 years in the last 15 I've managed to stay clean.   Always went the cold turkey route.  The last couple years I've used Kratom and benzos to help my withdrawls but I've never been in a MAT program . I've never been to rehab and only been to NA a few random times.  I don't have any user friends, I live in a small mountain town in the Northern Cascades and make the monthly 2 hour drive to the nearest metropolis to buy a piece of tar.  (24 grams for $900).  Quality is solid, not anything to brag about but they use the right type of cut and you don't get abscesses. My family knows I use and a few friends do but no one else in my town.   I've tried countless times to get clean on my own but I've finally admitted to myself I need help. My family is really pushing me to go on methadone. I hate the way suboxone makes me feel, methadone however is tolerable I think.   The few times I've bought people's carries on the black market, I was able to take 50-100mg and feel good. The horror stories about how methadone gets its claws into you are a little unnerving and I am scared I am trading a daily habit of BTH for a methadone addiction that will sink its claws in to me much deeper than the tar ever did.    Because I have no user friends I am not able to get any perspective other than the treatment community and some doctors.. who I just don't trust all the way.     If anyone out there has some life experiences with methadone and you think it would give me perspective outside of the shit the clinics say, I would be so grateful for the information.

I got into an inpatient facility after a while.  A few days later this woman shows up.  Super cute, but not really my type.  She ends up being in my group for counseling and I'm basically forced to spend the next 28 days hanging out with her.  She ends up being sweet and nice and we get along famously.  She seems overly friendly with me, but I'm just thinking she's looking for a way to pass the time with a little flirty banter. I can dig it. 
       
Anyways, my counselor convinces me to go to some sober living house after I get out of inpatient.  I fight it at first but eventually give in since some of my buddy's were going there too, and really I didnt have much else going on.   I'm not there but 3 days and who should show up?  Same girl.  Once again we end up in counseling together. 
      
 I start hearing from a bunch of my new friends from inpatient that she was seriously into me and I was just being oblivious I guess.  I talked to her and that all checks out.  I wasn't sure what I thought before, but honestly the more I thought about it the more I realized I basically feel that same way.

I found the news article about dboys arrest, found out his real name, town he's from, etc.

Turns out, he has almost 50 priors (!?) and was on parole. He was arrested after a pursuit in which he was the passenger, and the driver crashed into another vehicle. They both fled, cops found guns in the car, and eventually caught them. 

He's being charged with human trafficking, among other things. Apparently there's been an investigation ongoing since about the time I first met him.

I've lurked here for a while, and I thought it'd be interesting to hear some input from the community. I've been wondering, though- does anyone else use with the hope of ODing in the back of their mind? 

It's not a plea for help, but more an interest in getting an idea of the stats on this type of thinking. Personally, from the very first few times I dabbled in opiates, I've always looked at it as kind of a final destination. I certainly don't plan on ever quitting, and I like to think that I'll eventually slip away in a peaceful nod. That's beside the point, though- what I'm really interested in is how many of these seemingly accidental ODs are really just suicides that drag out over years of attempts. When I inevitably die from this, it certainly won't be an accident or tragedy in my mind. I'm in constant pain from an injury, unable to work anymore, suffered an awful childhood through adolescence, and have been extremely poor ever since birth. 

Sorry for dragging this out, I'm just genuinely curious as to how many addicts are on the same page with me.

This is what my arm looked like after an IV heroin shot. I don’t use that much anymore, and when I do I don’t IV anymore. Wanted to get a lil extra “oomph” and snorting more didn’t help.

I have had plenty of histamine reactions , and maybe even bigger ones, but never this severe!

It also didn’t go away quick like they usually do. To be honest, thinking back, I didn’t do ANY proper technique as far as harm reduction (I didn’t clean the area, and I hadn’t showered yet this morning, which is super gross thinking about it now, but since I’ve been snorting it did t click when I woke up)

Gonna post an update picture if it doesn’t start getting better :( it also kinda hurts, like that area stings.

I get 2 take homes per week, under normal circumstances, however I just tested (falsely) positive for fentanyl, for the 2nd time in a row. I am using kratom and I'm sure it is this that is causing the false positives. The clinic lets me challenge it with a GC/MS test. The first time this happened it came back in my favor and the take homes were reinstated, after 2 weeks of suspension.

Now, I have tested positive for the 2nd time in a row and will have to wait another 2 weeks to get them back again. I'm pretty fed up. I've not used any illicit drugs besides the kratom, which isn't really illicit and doesn't get me high, but it helps tremendously with my back pain. I'm getting really annoyed with this clinic and I'm probably going to start tapering and get off this junk. It's kept me sober and I'm grateful for that, but a lot of the rules are just stupid. I have to go every single day to dose. I have to go to two 1-hour long groups per week, plus a 30 minute counseling session every week. It really isn't ideal and even if you get the maximum take home allowance (2 weeks worth), you still have to go to those groups and counseling. This 2nd false positive and suspension of my take home medication is going to be the final straw. 

The other thing is I can't smoke pot with my take homes. The only reason I stopped smoking was to get take homes and because I needed to have a surgery and wanted to get in home dosing for afterwards (back surgery, would've SUCKED to go every day to the clinic after that, thankfully I got in home dosing and could just relax and heal up for a bit)

I'm on 40mg btw and this is the highest I've gone up to the whole time I've been on methadone, so tapering shouldn't take too long hopefully, I'm hoping to be off in 4-6 months I guess.",1536418078.0

I’ve had these stupid alps that I hate and never take but it’s been two weeks at this new job and it’s kicking my ass so I take bars at night to get a little sleep. God damnit. So of course if any of you have fucked with bars you know they wipe your memory like crazy if you drink on them. I have no tolerance to them like I only take them one and a half at a time at night after my ma goes to bed so I can’t fuck up anything. Stupidly though I have been talking to this dude and he cane down and things went really bad both nights he was here. He was a fucking wreck about his ex girlfriend and I’m just a fucking shithead person deep down. I’m typically very well written but I’m so fucking scared right now that my tit has cancer.  I can’t go back. Jesus fucking Christ if I have breast cancer it’s going to be the biggest joke the universe has ever played on me. Wow. I’m such a scumbag. I’m about to wake my mother up and make her feel my tit and see what she thinks. I have such a good family. I miss my little brother so much. My tit hurts. Jesus fucking Christ. If anyone on here has ever had breast cancer can you please answer the following questions for me? 

Did it appear overnight? 
**Mine did. Literally. 


What did it feel like? 
**Mine hurts but literally wasn’t there yesterday. Not sure if this dude came near my tits or not but I know we never fooled around. 

Am I gonna probably die?
**I haven’t felt sick but I started losing weight. Just started a new job that’s been super physical though. Food hasn’t been needed much because I figured the alprazalom at night made me not want food much. 

I’m so scared. Never felt this high in my life. I joke about wanting to die all the time but Jesus Christ I’m so scared. I can’t google this shit because I’m not going to find anything from anything I believe to be true. I need someone I trust anonymously and you guys I trust. Someone please tell me what breast cancer feels like. Please. The reason this is on this subreddit is because I’ve been an opiate junkie since I took my first pain pill at age 16. I work in retail again and it’s in a deli and it’s hard fucking work. I started using really bad again when my friend died and things have been whack as fuck in my life since May. I finally got off oxys at the end of July and haven’t taken anymore. I just can’t my life is too good right now. I can’t have breast cancer. Jesus Christ. Okay that’s all. I either have to try and sleep and hope it’s not there when I wake up or something. Okay thanks guys. Love you all and love this sub. I bet I’ll get some dope ass pills if I have cancer. Oh my god I hate myself. ",1536407191.0

This was *way* too much for me (I usually get munted off like 40mg, and I hadn’t used for about 2 months). I was then super nauseous all night and honestly I didn’t even really end up nodding out bc I was on a lot of LSD (400ug) so I’m kinda mad abt the whole thing. 

Anyway tho I just bought 200mg of oxy and I was wondering how long I should wait before I’ll be right to get high off my normal dose (probably about 30mg)? 

Will I still nod out if I take that much or would my tolerance have built off the one massive dose I took last week? I obviously don’t wanna waste it bc shits expensive here.

I only had a few withdrawal symptoms while using the kratom with like a few hours of withdrawals each day. As soon as I got off the plane I copped and went back to daily usage. This lasted a few weeks until I got kicked out of my oxford house and decided to check myself back into treatment. They sent me to detox first where I expected to hit withdrawals and get subutex but they never came. At most I had the sniffles and anhedonia. The day I checked into detox I shot my last 20 bag of bth at 10 a.m. and around 3 p.m. I ate a few edibles from the dispensary and a half gram capsule of o.p.m.s. Kratom extract and about 2-3 grams of regular leaf. I was also shooting meth intermittently, like 1-2 times a week, meth which apparently had mdma and amphetamine in it because I later popped positive for both. I’m just wondering if anyone has had any similar experiences with little to no withdrawal or if anyone would know why I didn’t experience any withdrawal. The last time I went on a run I had zero withdrawal but I was only using every other day for about 3 weeks. I’m just curious and also worried about my sobriety when the back of my head is telling me withdrawals aren’t as bad as they used to be. I take quite a few non-narcotic prescription meds also but I doubt they had anything to do with it.",1536382415.0

The nurse comes out and looks at the vomit but said we might not be able to help you cuz you where not in the building. So I freak out some more. They know I’m a good kid and shit so the nurse calls the area director. They end up giving me a half dose of 40mg to hold me over till tomorrow. I don’t feel as bad as I thought I was so thank god for that but I was scared I would go back out again. I’m trying to not to be weak and relapse cuz of what happened.

9dz9qp,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9dz9qp/looking_for_advice/,16,https://redd.it/9dz9qp,iksosecac,Looking for Advice.,"My girlfriend and I are heroin addicts in recovery. We have significant clean time(multiple years) with the help of Suboxone/Subutex and one another, not to mention having been blessed with our first child. She's 16 weeks pregnant and has been taking Subutex legally through a private Doctor, but has been having issues the last 4 times she's taken a Urine Drug Screen. She keeps coming up positive for Opiates AND Buprenorphine, which is crazy to me considering that people usually don't take both together because of the higher affinity the Buprenorphine has for the opiate receptors, making full agonists like Codeine and Morphine unable to produce desired effects. She knows this very well, and I know what she's saying about not having been using is the truth. We live together and spend almost every minute of every day together. She's scared out of her mind because despite having told her provider that she hasn't used with our child in her stomach, making him take a blood test for a second time to attempt to prove she's not making this shit up, that she's literally been coming up positive for opiates for quite some time when she's not taking anything but Subutex and a Prenatal Vitamin (prescribed by her OBGYN and produced through her pharmacy, not some unregulated brand from the vitamin isle.).

&#x200B;

She is scared of having to be thrown off this medication that will put her and our child in danger, but she's not sure what to do considering she's not sure why this is happening to her. She's not able to just stop using to be able to pass her  tests because unlike most people that go into these Dr. Offices and deny the outcomes of their Urine Drug Screens, She is unable to just stop doing what's causing positive results on these drug tests because she really isn't doing opiates.

&#x200B;

I don't have any clue as to what the cause is, I just know that she's been on her Subutex and not making this up. I live with her and she's been sober. It's not just another addict trying to lie their way out of trouble. I need some help.

&#x200B;

Does anyone know what may be causing something like this or know of any similar cases? I would appreciate any ideas or advice. Please don't be hesitate to ask questions or share your experiences of anything relevant to this post. Thanks Reddit.",1536359755.0

this is a long time coming and I am finally making the move to get clean.  I have been using prescription  pills for decades now and I realize that I can't spend the second half of my life like I have since my 20s.

&#x200B;

I was never a hard abuser.  Stayed with the prescribed dosage, but I have always had them in my system.  Started like many do.  I had surgery to reattach a finger, got pain meds for it, and it snowballed after that.

Currently I am using 10/325mg Norco.  4 a day.  And I have never wavered from that.  But I do know that I am going to have some physical withdrawal and I am not looking forward to the feelings of withdrawal. 

&#x200B;

I have done my reading and I have gotten prepared, I just want to run down my plan and see if any of you kind folks have any other suggestions I can add into the mix.  

I preface this by saying that I am not going to use alcohol, weed or other narcotics to help with the process.  Seems foolish to rob Peter to pay Paul.

&#x200B;

I have about 15 of the pills left, and I was going to split them in half, and take half a pill 3x a day during the beginning of the detox.

&#x200B;

My doctor prescribed me with .2mg clonidine #40.  I was planning on taking one of those 4x a day with the option to split the pills if the .2mg was too much.

&#x200B;

I have a couple boxes of Walmart loparamide 2mg gel tabs, and figured 6 a day would help with some of the achey feelings as well as the possible diarrhea.  I also have a box of Benadryl for help with the sneezing and runny nose.

&#x200B;

Anyone who has experience with this, I welcome your insight.  I am really looking forward to not always checking my pocket to make sure I have a couple pills with me where ever I go.  I am looking forward to not having the hassle of making sure I get my refill in time, and that I don't have to go into a pharmacy and feel like they are looking at me funny.  And mostly I am looking forward to actually being myself and not keeping this lie going that nobody but me knows about.

&#x200B;

thank you in advance, I really appreciate the help and insight.  I am hoping that by this time next week I am well on my way to being the true me.

It all started with his classic, ""It's an EMERGENCY"". Well, not exactly. Let's try to run through some chronologically ordered text messages. I'll also be sure to reference the less frequent voicemail and AIM. Yes, I said AIM. No, we are not using AIM but the name will be used in this post as a catch-all term for any form of web-based messaging; examples include AIM, ICQ, Hangouts, Viber, ~~that shit girls use on dating sites~~ whatsapp, Telex, and Telegram.


&nbsp;



It could be said that it started last week on the third when Cliff texted me asking if I could bring some canned-air over (Dust-off).


Cliff:
>I figured after work do u have the spray for the keyboard? i need it 4 the keyboard. I'd stop by to grab it if ok lata[.]



Of course I asked if he needed a liquid spray or dustoff - this being the colloquially accepted name for Dust-Off. To which he responded to indicate that the keys are sticking on the laptop I gave him months ago. 

In his words,
>IDK whatever u think is better for keys that are stickin down[.]


What the fuck is a can of compressed air going to do to fix sticky keys? I mean yeah, I guess in theory you could flip the can upside down, spray out the freezing cold low boiling point liquid and use it to freeze what I assume to be sticky cola residue. **More on that impractical theory below as well as a legitimate solution to removing chewing gum from fabrics with great ease!** Anyway, compressed-air being used as intended is not going to make sticky keyboard keys any less sticky. 


&nbsp;

I didn't jump to assist because I didn't feel like it. Plus, expending effort only reinforces that it's okay for Cliff to be careless with his laptop. I'm not saying that I'm an angel but when I take measures to avoid spilling any amount of liquid on my computer. When I do get something on it, I take immediate action and the majority of my careless involves crumbs of food.  

&nbsp;

In Cliff's case, soda seems to be the top culprit although other solids do accumulate. Two laptops ago, he opened a bottle of soda and the fizz sprayed onto his keyboard. My advice? Suck it out of the keyboard with a vacuum or your mouth while holding it upside down. That's what I would do if I spilled liquid on a button on the front of my phone, and I've done it when I've spilt liquid between the buttons on my touch-pad.

&nbsp;

Of course I didn't offer to do that for Cliff and he didn't follow my advice to do so. I can't blame folks for not listening but that is the only quick way I know of to prevent damaging buttons on personal devices after a beverage spill. After a quick wipe down the computer worked fine for the next day or two. Then otu of nowhere two days later he couldn't turn it on - ""the orange light blinks when I try to turn it on."" No shit, you spilled something in it. ""It worked fine after..."" I hate when people ask the expert but wish to get an answer which doesn't involve blaming themselves. I don't give a fuck if your computer worked fine for two days after you spilled something on it - I'm still certain that the original spill is the root cause to any electrical problems which occur a couple of days later.


&nbsp;


Many people who are careless with electronics never admit to wrongdoing. The same with the power cord for his MacBook which I'm about to replace. A while back he bought a MacBook from me, the power cord was shit and went bad from metal fatigue. I repaired it and he fucked it up himself. Before I replaced the cord I was like ""you gott atake care of the replacment cord, you can't just throw it around on the floor"" and he was like ""I'll take care of it, I don't throw my my computer on the floor."" Then of course I watched him do just that when he was barred out. After that when the power cord stopped workign the second time, I didn't bother to rush to replace it.



It has gotten to the point where he basically doesn't even remember that I owe him a power cord for his MacBook. Back when he did remember he'd state, ""I paid for that comptuer in full""; he was so proud - or once in his life he paid something off. Of course he only paid the fina linstallment the first time around because his power cord went bad and he knew empty promises would not get me to hustle. 

&nbsp;






So why do I suddenly want to get him his replacement power cord? I have a feeling that his laptop keyboard is more fucked up than he's revealing. I've accumulated more MacBook power cords recently - so I figured first I'll round them all up in a box and test them. Determine which ones do and don't work. Then I'll go through the non-working ones and determine how many of them are easy to fix. I might even give him one that is currently working but I do prefer to give him a broken one that gets repaired because he doesn't really deserve a fresh Mac power cord in good condition, he'll just fuck it up anyway.



Right now I don't fully command the moral high-ground and wont until I follow through on my word to provide a working replacement power supply for his MacBook. The MacBook is probably sitting in a pile of laundry. For all I know a rat pissed on it. Yet another reason to give him a shitty hand-repaired power cord.



&nbsp;

Plus, I suspect that his current keyboard woes on the random Dell laptop I gave him in the past are going to make that machine unusable without full disassembly and I am in no longer have the inclination to do that shit for his sake.

&nbsp;



#TL;DR:

**What is Cliff's current emergency?**

I speculate that it is related to the initial request for Dust-Off because his ""keys are sticking down"", however there is more.


**The other day I was biking to work** and his sister was sitting out front with her nodded down. I waved, got no response and kept going. A few minutes later Cliff texts,

> U just biked past me, thanx for ignoring me all weekend! I really had an emergency.

This message is in reference to when he texted earlier in the weekend, **""Call me ASAP it's emergency really !""** I never call Cliff when he asks me to call him regarding an emergency. For a multitude of reasons.


So when I was biking to work, I gave some BS excuse about being busy.. doesn't really matter because I reserve the right to not care. Anyway, he goes on,

>Can u text me after work when u get home? Don't worry I'll remind ya""


Well then, I guess I don't gave to text him after work, he'll remind me. Anyway, I had to see Danika for subs after work so that was my top priority. As far as Cliff is concerned I'm clean and not even on subs right now. I figured earlier on that was the best impression to perpetuate so he doesn't plan around my supply of subs being his safety net.


Anyway, I responded to that ""text me after work"" request by saying, ""Plus I didn't' even know what the emergency hype was about.""

He states,

>Its not cash or drugs or anything like that. **It was a life and death matter no joke**


So I ask, ""asthma?""

He goes on,

>Something like that, you goin to b around 2nite?
>I got all my goodies lol


I guess that last point is to indicate that he doesn't need anything because he has been resupplied. I continued by stating that I ""got off work late and had to be in early after."" Then he asks,


>Maybe 2nite we catch up for 15 minutes or so?

Arghh, whenever he needs something from me and I'm not biting asks in that format. Variations of, ""pick up your phone for just two minutes"" or the 15-20 minutes which inevitably turns into 50-60 minutes. Maybe it shouldn't be so hard to sit down and catch up with a ""friend"" but I can't afford to expose myself to his bed bugs and I fucking hate the smell which sticks to my clothes on humid days. I fucking don't feel like exposing myself to the smell of raw garage on this warm and humid rainy day.

I didn't respond later when he asked ""whats up?""


Nor did I respond when this morning when he texted, 


>Text me when u awake[.]


&nbsp;


He had plenty of opportunities to explain why he needs my presence. I've been left to speculate above but as much as I suspect it's electronics related, he did say ""something like that"" when I asked if it was asthma or a matter of his mom falling down on the floor which happens on occasion.

If he said his mom had fallen, I'd be quick to jump but ""life of death"" could be anything. Sine he says it's not drugs or money (the top of my list of life or death), it must be his computer. You know, sometimes it could be life or death. Maybe he's trying to fill out some insurance paperwork and the web page isn't working - that's like life or death to him. Still, probably isn't quite that.... I don't want to take a chance.


&nbsp;

My plan is to do turtle and tortoise tank maintenance, eat a bit more and then go on a long bike ride. Maybe during my long bike ride I'll call him from the convenience of my Bluetooth headphones. I will not risk placing a phone call like that or answering while I'm still home or in the neighborhood. I don't want to have a sudden moment of weakness, or accidentally slip into saying I'm available to come through. 


&nbsp;

Assuming it's not related to money or drugs...

&#x200B;

In my country Ireland I have only ever heard Methadone dosage referred to as Mls (Milliliters). Clinic starting dose is usually 30 mls. 80-90 mls is what Doctors here consider the dose that pretty much filled the receptors meaning you need a huge dose of heroin to break through and feel anything. 

&#x200B;

120 - 130 mls is usually what Doc's will allow people go to with the intention of making using heroin practically useless although I have heard of people going to 180mls in rare cases. Individual Doctors here have a lot of power over what prescription you get.

&#x200B;

Anyways my question is Does anyone know the conversion chart for mls to mgs?

 I read a lot here about mgs which seems to be what most Americans are prescribed amd knowing the conversion would be really helpful.",1536343127.0

All oral ROA:

100mg Flexeril  
100mg Oxycodone (pure, IR)

16mg Zofran

3 Manhattans

&#x200B;

All of this was over the course of about 2 hours, with all pills being taken at once at the start. Here I am about 3 hours from initial ingestion and I'm already feeling everything wearing off. What. The. Fuck. I feel like this is enough to kill an elephant, but I barely got to enjoy a ride for 2 hours. I was even on an empty stomach with a few snacks during the build up! So my question, somewhat rhetorical: what the hell is wrong with my body? Shouldn't this be enough to give someone else a first class, direct flight to the ER? Yet here I am basically feeling wired for sound and ready to take a shower and go to work!  


Since I have access to numerous meds of all kinds (Tramadol 50mgl, Norco 7.5/325, Oxycodone 10mg IR, Hydromorphone 2mg, Atarax 50mg, Lexapro - don't know the dose, Flexeril 10mg), I have many ways to try and float away for a bit. Is maybe my tolerance just too high to enjoy these recreationally? 100mg each of Flexeril and 100mg Oxycodone combined with a bunch of bourbon seems like it should do the trick, but alas no.

I was vomiting, sweating and shaking, hallucinating...the whole nine years. The resident doctor told me either I check into treatment or I’m going to die. 

Anyways, I walk into the clinic and guess who I see! The same fuckin’ doctor.

So I wanna share a bit about my experience w suboxone, as I see a lot of comments on here about how its so hard to kick, and also how it's not ""really clean."" I started using at 19. I went from a working class chick taking pills to a stripper/escort doing IV tar heroin in about 3 yrs time, then in another 4 yrs I had become a fuckin panhandler and scam artist living in a tent. To say I didn't give a fuck about ""really clean"" when I got on the subs is an understatement. I just wanted to not die a bum with a needle in my arm. When I first got on the suboxone I figured I'd be on it for life. After getting off the streets and waiting tables for a few years, I ended up going back to school for a degree, and I decided I wanted to be off the subs by the time I graduated. I stared to wean down from 8 mgs per day. I weaned VERY SLOW. Like 1 mg every 6 months. Now, here is the key. When I got down to 1 mg, I then started taking .5 mgs EVERY OTHER DAY. Then .5 every day for a while, then alternating. 5 w .25 every other day. And so on. I did not go thru withdrawal people!! All in all I was on the suboxone for 7 yrs. The key is to change your life, and TAPER SLOW.
Wish this story had a happier ending kids, but after 5 years off the subs and being a ""productive member of society"" I had a ""midlife crisis"" and relapsed on morphine pills, which I fuck around with on the dl like the asshole I am. K thanks for listening, love u all, bai!",1536283805.0

This includes knee pain, joint pain, back pain, feet and ankle swelling, breaking out all of my face, entente sweating, waking up out of breath, horrible night terrors, depersonalization, hearing my heartbeat in my ears, throwing up, headaches, barely being able to eat, extreme fatigue. 

I am only now taking 2mg in the morning and 2mg at night so 4mg total. 

I went to my sub dr today and of course he denied that any of these effects were from suboxone and recommend that I go down to a quarter of this does once in the morning and once at night. 

I’m going to try that I guess for a couple days and see if it helps but I’m so ready to just jump off this shit. I have jumped off at 2mg before and it was not bad. I just feel like this stuff is really messing with me physically and mentally. 

Has anyone else experienced this? If so what did you do? ",1536277230.0

This time the blood wasn't the dark maroon red but was like kind of like blood from an artery. However the blood didn't flood the rig and wasn't foamy. I injected and it started to burn however I was in. I finished the shot in my neck because I didn't want to keep feeling that pain. It was a new syringe too. 

Is this an artery even though the blood wasn't frothy and fill the rig on its own? I have a lump at the injection site now and it is kind of sore.  I only pushed about 15 units before relocating",1536272672.0

I was parked at a store a block away and around the corner from the hotel my dealer lady is working out of. Or was anyways.  Anxiously searching for my scale, cooker, rig and lighter from inside the seat.  Snot drips onto my lap and I wipe my eyes and nose when I hear my phone.

"" I'm sending someone with it now. Double check weight when you get it"" 

""Ok"" I say back to her. In supposed to be looking for some asshole in a blue shirt. I hope he doesn't short my bag. I am only picking up enough for my girl and I to get well. We are quitting here today..ok tomorrow. But we have to quit! I'm going on a trip with family three states over and she is going to stay with her fam while I'm gone. There's only two days before the trip and we want to get some kratom or sub in our system before we have to see family. 

""Where the fuck is this guy"" I say to my girlfriend. It's been 10 minutes on the dot and it's a small city block. I decide to do a lap around the store I'm parked at . No dude"" 

"" he's not here.. i checked the area and street. "" 

"" I'm coming"" she says. Weird. I thought she was sending a runner. Shits hot right now. Cops are getting into this circle I'm in and I know she is first on the list since they got her boyfriend last week. 

5 minutes pass and I see her walking towards us. 
"" she's all done up for us today huh?"" I laugh and gesture towards the mirror where my girl could see her approaching us. Wearing baggy grey sweats, pink tanktop, crazy fuckin hair and a grey, loose fitting hoody. Aviators to top it off. 

"" here you go, sorry my guy didn't see you I guess"" 

"" yeah I didn't see him either. How's things going with your man? He had court right?"" 

"" yeah he did. Couple charges dropped but they added possession for some reason. He should get out..but his parole fucks this up you know?"" 

"" fuck, yeah I forgot. I hope he gets out. Hell, I wish I  could bail him out. He's a fuckin good guy you know. "" 

"" yeah, fuckin cops. Well I'm going back to the roon. Don't want to be out too much haha. Be safe"" 

"" you be safe! Keep us updated please"" 

She cuts off a car pulling in to the parkinglot by walking in front of it, right when they pulled in off the street. We laugh at her and she laughs and glares at the driver of the car as she goes back. 
"" they're parking next to us so keep your shit down "" is what I say to my lady as I'm cooking my shot like it was a life or death situation. Shoot dat shit or , die I think. The car pulls into the spit next to us, I lean over and stare at them and see they're kinda mean looking Mexican dudes so I assume they're cool and they just look back at me blankly. Awkward. Then, they back up, two point reposition car angle and park in a spot behind us and down a space or two. 

We do our shit but leave about a half a point each. Cottons still soaked so if shit doesn't work out later, we have that .05 and a cotton to rinse. I grab a soda and pull out onto the road. Crack the pop i bought and it's so good. Just got well and it's warm,  ice cold sweet sweet vanilla coke. Not my favorite but it's what I could get. 

I'm headed to grab my friends cash so i can middle a half g for him and his girl. They re sick down the road so I turn off onto their road. Slide into a spot next to him and he gets out immediately.  Ad soon as he hits my window and starts talking- red and blues.  ""What the fuck man"" I look at him like it's his fault. I've sold to this guy about 20 times in two weeks.  But he's not acting guilty. He's actually doing a damn good job improv bullshitting the cop and setting up our aliby before my eyes. I hand my license and shit to the cop. 

Another cop suv. K-9. Blocks us in and two men get out. Another suv, pulls I'm next to us, two more men. A silver Chevy car pulls in past that. Oh fuck.. this isn't good at all. It's the car from the store. That she cut off. They stayed behind us that whole fucking time. I'm hiding shit the best I can. While they're all making their way to the doors of my truck. 

"" you just here to play a little game of pool huh? "" 

"" yes sir! My friends and I here are on a little double date and we haven't played in years so hell why not right? 

"" yeah,  why not.  Hey, since you're just here for that, nothing illegal,  would you mind if we searched the car? "" 

""Well I wouldn't mind but I do not consent to it yet. Why do you feel the need? 

Rising from the silver car a Mexican man I recognize now as a local narc team member. He throws his vest on and walks over. 

"" because that's how we catch the bad guys sometimes kids"" the narc says. 

"" fine. Lock box under my seat,  scale inside middle seat, two knifes on me, bullets in the doors of the truck, no guns and my dogs are nice."" 

""You can take the dogs to the sidewalk with you""

As they proceed to dig into my shit like little fuckin pigs in a slop trough the narc comes yo me and sits down. ""You know why I'm here. "" 

"" why officer? I'm afraid I dont, this is a lot of fuss over a seatbelt isn't it?"" I shoot him a smile and he laughs 

"" yes well it's not that. It's what you did at that store back there.  You met up with  (my dealer) and she talked with you.  You then exchanged something and she walked off. What was all that about "" 

"" Well I met my friend there and she gave me this five bucks she owed me  from the other night. That's all. Why?"" 

"" becAuse she sold you dope, you shot up right there and bought a soda and she went back to room xxx at the hotel.  You then moved down here to meet with your friends here and I'm assuming sell then dope. That true "" 

"" nosir. I in fact got this money and that's that.  Your right though.  I did do a fat shot right there. That soda was great too"" 

He leaves.  Well fuck me. They have been watching all of us. Thank God I wasn't actually re upping. Although, if I was Doing that things would have went down differently and I would have a back middle pocket filled to the brim with black and meth.  

"" Ok so its on tape. I'll show you.  Also your girl admitted that I was right. "" fuck "" also, she doesn't have a phone so I'll confiscate yours now "" fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fucky fuckin fuck.  

After taking it to his car, he stays there a while. I pet my dogs,  have a cigarette and exchange the looks of great concern with my girl and my two friends who are inside playing pool . It's not looking good. He returns with my phone. 

"" I copied your texts but you encrypted your phone I noticed so you can just have it back. Tracphones are nearly useless to me anyways"" 

Yikes. This clown is really serious about fucking me in the ass today. He asks me about my habit and also offeres me a cigarette. Then the question ive been waiting for. "" you want to help me help you or go to jail "" 

Ok. So I do want to go in these family trips. I have guns and those rights are about to be toasted big time . "" yeah of course"" 

He tells me how the buy will go down and I'm acting all for it, a little hesitant to it at first but who wouldn't be. My plan was to agree to do it tomorrow. I would need more drugs. By then and it would seem legit. I would then hide from the cops until my out of state adventure. I would also be in deep shit when I got home . 

He wouldn't do it . He wanted to do it right then.  No fucking around. I decline and get cuffed and put into the car with my girl. I leave my keys and dogs with my friends and that's it. Game over. We get to the jail and they book us but it's full. It's 6pm and they do not let people out after dark. They stick us into solitary holding cells. No blankie.  Crazy fuckers in other cells scream, bang on the door and cry.  This will be a good night.  

I get a migraine from the stress, noise, smell of the cell and also the milk. They notify us at midnight we can leave if we have a ride. My girl calls her dad and he is on his way. Be there in 15. Hour or more passes and we get out.  Walking to the parkinglot and we are greeted with her whole family.  They freak out and take me to my truck and keep her with them.  

I'm pretty upset at this point . Can't leave state. Can't own or use guns, mugshot is online for everyone to see.  Fuckin fantastic situation boys. I'm pretty unhappy about all of it tbh.

($280/month) It’s due on the 4th of each month, and I am usually able to have enough cash to pay it with some extra money for food, gas, drugs, etc. 

Last month I was late by 10 or 11 days so they got me with a $20 late fee, whatever, no big deal so I owed $300 instead of $280 this month, My thinking is so fucked up that I lie to myself saying “I’ll just pay it with the money I get from the very last minute” at work and hope and pray that I’ll get enough tip $ to be able to pay it. 

I make $13 and hour OFF the books plus tips, so it’s a good job for a 20 year old guy. However this time I said “fuck it” I’m soooo sick with diarrhea, hot/cold sweats, painful cramps, runny nose, vomiting, restless legs, lack of quality sleep, depression through the roof, anxiety, crying my eyes out, etc. 

I’ve been through withdraws more times than I can count but this time around they were absolutely horrible. I had close to enough money to pay it, I just needed to work 2 more shifts and I would have enough without being more than 10 days late. (Progressive allows for 10 days late before they stop your policy)

SO, I decided to spend the last of my money on heroin  instead of putting it aside for my insurance premium. I’m writing this now feeling tremendously good compared to this morning and early afternoon. HOWEVER, I’m not going to be able to pay it before the 10 day grace period and I’m concerned that Progressive will discontinue my policy. In all honestly I’m high as GIRAFFE  PUSSY right now and I don’t even care!  

I know this was NOT the right thing to do, I know I’m going to get sick tomorrow but I’m the king of procrastination and putting things aside for a different day. I’m so stupid for this, but I hope someone else can read this and learn from my mistakes, if you’re new to opiates. If you’ve never been through withdrawals you’re in for a wake up call. They suck donkey dick, and personally, I’ll do anything including risking my car insurance being cancelled so I can get high for one night. 

Anyway, I hope everyone else is having a better day than me, and staying safe! Happy Thursday guys and gals! ",1536270200.0

Does anyone have a clue as to why this pain would have occurred as to I am curious because this has never happened before in the 300-plus times that I have used a needle in this spot.",1536258575.0

I'm just wondering this because I'm at the point where I can't use any more and my mind is not in the right state to detox at home right now even if I got the right supplies, I want to go on methadone to start to get back on track, I have ADHD and was on medication for years until I got out of high school and started to get involved in heroin, I would like to eventually get off the methadone and go back to a doctor and be put back on medication for the ADHD and im worried  that having the methadone clinic on my record will affect that too, I'm sorry if this doesn't make much sense or if I'm making a big deal out of nothing my head is in a really bad place right now and I can barley think straight anymore

Now, I've just been banging these straight mostly but PG is thick and is very hard to push through a 27g needle. PG is water soluble so I figured I could dilute it down with some water to thin it out, so I added a ml to my 3 ml shot and immediately some cloudy white shit starts to form. After googling intensively I find out that you're not supposed to mix iv valium with other meds for this reason. Now my question is is there any other way to thin it out? Plus, Mine is an oral solution (no sugar/syrup) is there anything that could be more dangerous than shooting the vials? It seems to be the same ingredients as the vials anyway. Is it really the case that you can't add PG-benzo solutions to water? That's a real shame because I was looking forward to mixing some nice valium-morphine and valium-fentanyl shots. ",1536243097.0

Might be known around here, might not- I do hang out on the unofficial IRC channel (which i recommend) ..  i wanted to tell you about my buddy who recently bit the dust.. and dont worry its not an OD story- but it *is* precautionary in nature. 

Saturday afternoon in Wisconsin, we're eating cheese curds and drinking cheap beer- stereotypical as it may be.  My group of friends had ran into a few people in the bar.. I saw a dude who I know so I figured instead of standing around i would go see whats up.  

As soon as i get close enough to him i can tell he's a little bit distraught and it turned out he was fighting with the old lady.  these things happen, and i didn't want to intrude or ask anything that might make a bad night worse.. so we just drank next to each other for a few minutes.   after rocking a piss, i come out and see him standing up to walk out, saying he was getting a couple bars in the parking lot.  didn't think much of this since bars are pretty commonplace, especially during times of strife.  a few minutes later my man comes back in, obviously happy about his shenanigans.  i didn't think much of it until he said that he paid 3 dollars a piece.   hooooold up, wtf.., lemme see one of those.

these are obvious presses, i say.  he struggles to grasp the concept of counterfeit pills.    this imprint hasn't been around for years, i say.  he says his guy is an 'old head' and proceeds to ask me how a pill can be fake.  you can touch one and its like touching the chalk before you shoot pool.     my final word on the matter was 'they're pressed, call your guy and ask whose script they are from' .. 

i didn't see my buddy for a few minutes, went outside in time to see him situating a female on the back of his bike.  before i can really even make my way to his location, he has the bike started and pulls it over toward me- doing some stupid drunken revs and telling me to stop by a little later.  

This long ass story just to get to this point:   my friend took a potent alp press, convinced this girl to jump on his bike, made it six fucking minutes down the road before crashing and killing his passenger and himself.    

if you know anyone who likes to play with pharma, make sure they know what a press is.  i'm not sure if my buddy would be alive if it was a 2mg pharma bus or not- but not every user knows about helpful communities such as this.

i can only imagine how long this post will be.. but thats only because im laying here, stuck in my head, thinking about the aforementioned events.  and because i type a lot faster than i think.  love you motherfuckers, stay safe

One night we were talking about movies and I said I wanted to see the new ""Mission impossible"" She asked ""with who?"" And I said ""probably by myself"" ( I was serious. This was not an attempt on my part to ask her out or anything) SHE suggested that she would see it with me. I thought it was odd cause she never showed an interest like that. We go to the movies, as friends, and it was fun. I really did have a good time. We start texting each other each night to see how eachother day went. She told me she's been had a crush on me as long as we have worked. She said a ""little"" crush.  I think it's more than a little. Now im not Brad Pitt but im also no Lyle Lovett.  I can get girls if I really tried ( I dont)  Even my mom said I'm a good looking guy lol . Had a bad relationship and just HATE the feeling of being let down and wondering what's going on. Hate, hate, hate it. So I avoid them. (sad, I know)  I was also a drug addict who is now on suboxone.  She has no idea about that. She is a really sweet girl. Like really sweet. I don't know why but after talking every night I start to look forward to it. I guess I like her. She asked me to go to lunch.  I said okay. Had a good time once again. Had lunch, then went out for coffee. Smooth. The thing is every time I suggest we go out (likte 3 times I've brought it up casually over the last month and a half ) to lunch/breakfast she says something like "" I have some studying to do but we can do something"" We never do. So I haven't bothered asking in awhile. Found out I have Saturday off so I said something like "" Hey if you want to go for breakfast Saturday i wouldn't mind"" She busts out the studying thing again. I KNOW she likes me. I am not being pushy. I make sure of it. Tonight I told her I don't feel like texting this evening and she said ""can I text you tomorrow please?!"" I get in asshole mode and say "" I'll see you at work"" which is Friday, and sidestepping her question. None of this is said with any malice. Just a different game plan. I felt shitty cause I'm actually not an asshole. I guess im really asking for advice from the girls on here. We know eachother likes one another.  It's not a secret. Is she leading me on? Is she trying to get over her boyfriend? I've made a decision to ease up and go back to how it was before we knew we liked eschother.  Partly because I'm over it (I don't NEED to be in a relationship.  I like being alone tbh. So I'm not desperate). I just was digging her. She is pleasant to talk to. Fun. So the question is... If you were in this situation and the guy you liked and knew liked you back started to be short/cold with you would this make you more or less likely to want to keep talking to said guy? The ole playing hard to get move. I know I've had that happen to me and I wanted to talk to the girl more. Lol. I learned from that mistake. I never push. She already reversed and said we could do something this weekend but thats not really the point anymore. Im not a baby who needs to be pacified.  The thing is i want to make sure I'm not being used as a ""rebound "" This is just not the type of girl to play a game like that so its hard for me to believe. I like her cause shes, compared to me, innocent. Somewhat naive to the world. I don't know.  She's just a nice person. I need that in my life. That's the only reason I'm asking for advice on a sub for drugs.  Wr havent even been physical and by physical I mean not even holding hands. Just hasn't progressed to that. She's the type to say things in joke form so if it's not received well it can be played off as a joke. Shes self conscious for some reason. Shes ""joked"" about things like that though. I just don't get it. Any help? I know this is stupid I just don't have anyone else to ask. I told you I like being alone. Thanks guys. I understand if this gets pulled",1536208298.0

for example I take 30 -40 mg of oxycodone once every month or two. Could i take heroin orally in the same manner or would simply doing it once make me into a compulsive addict?
 
I would never have considered heroin but i researched online that heroin metabolizes into mostly morphine by the liver. Oxycodone metabolizes into its morphine counterpart Oxymorphone.So i figured that everything about the two drugs must be awfully similar as far as effects and addictiveness. I believe that the only reason heroin is ranked the most addictive drug on earth is because when IV’d it hits blood-brain barrier as diacetylmorphine so it passes through way faster than normal morphine and once in the brain all of the diecetylmorphine gets turned into morphine and all the morphine hits all at once creating an extreme rush. 

So would oral heroin be similar to oxycodone?
To further elaborate what i mean. as long as you dont take heroin orally for more than once a month would you start to crave it ? 

Please dont comment to not do heroin ,to me those answers feel generic unless you have had an experience with heroin because 99% of the time people with no experience with heroin are biased against it

My very close friend I've known since we were in 6th grade was found behind a local Safeway grocery store. He killed himself and from there estimates he'd been there for 2-3 days at least. He slit his wrists and all he had on him was a picture of him and his girlfriend of 3 years in his hands. She was going to suprise him tomorrow and break the news that she was pregnant with his child. This Monday was his 1 year sobriety anniversary as well. I have no idea why he did what he did and I'll never know. He was one of only people who has genuinely been there for me no matter what and vice versa. I haven't even cried about it. I think I'm just in shock and so numb from it still. I just want to kill someone or shoot a gram of dope up. But I'm not going to, the urge is definitely there though. I'm sorry for my shit post. I just don't have anyone i can talk to about things like this now that he's gone, and I think if I don't talk about it and let my feelings out I'll just blow up and do something stupid that I'll regret..
I'm currently smoking a blue pressed 30 in the bathroom and then I'm going to smoke a blunt and cigarette after that. I think I'm just going to find a movie on Netflix to watch and just escape reality for a couple hours. I just wish I had someone to hold me and tell me everything will be okay but it is what it is.

I know that the most of you dont know me. But I know many of you guys. I am in this sub since about 2 years now. I had another Account before on which I posted and commented much here. But I forgot the password since I got a new phone. Fuckin dopehead I cant remsmber much if I do dope. Which I do at the moment not regulary or better said I try to not do it regulary. I try to be a chipper. And i hope it works anyhow a bit now. The last time I tried it I got hooked after 2 months again. Before that I was for nearly 3 month completly clean. But thats not the way for me right now. I need dope at least untill I finished my fucking job in 6 month. In these 6 month I try to use just for 3 days then I got some benzos to help with minimal wds if I get some and take a break for about a week. Thats my plan. I know it sounds stupid and mostly I will get hooked again and be that idiot junky again. But hey junks gonna junk. I just wanted to introduce myself today. I am male 22 and not from the US. I mentioned the thimg with the US because of the fent laced dope which scares me much. I never heared of fent laced H #3 here in Germany. At least not where I live. I know in the much bigger citys it sometimes appears. But very occassional. Fent got its completly own market. We also dont got a big pill market here. OC 80 cost for me 10€ a pop. So thats great but I prefer dope much more. Since the rush is much stromger for me and I like the high more too. But I got some back up pills for wd everytime in my wd box. Together with benzos and other shit. So I also started my addiction with pills too like many of you. For me it was Tilidin and tramadol first after my dad died. Then I bought some oxy on the street, here are all pills im blisters so you definitly know to 90% they are real since I heared that in some countrys they even fake blisters. I was cleam for the last 4 days and today I got 2gs of some fire #3 with a purity of about 60-80% lab tested from my dboy. He is a good guy and cares about his customers. I sniffed about 100mg and also took 2mg of Alprazolam and some blue pill with DEM on it which I didnt know what it is. Its a benzos amd I think its a bit stronger than diazepam. I got It for free with 15 alpraz 1mg and 10 10mg diaz I bought them for 20€. The 2g cost me about 70€. So dope is here very cheap if I hear some prizes from you guys in the states. I hope everyone is fine and enjoys his evening night. This is just a introducing-/shitpost cause I was in the moood to do that. Have a good night and watch out for urself. Oh and I love it to go to my loved noddyland. I just love it to nod out. I hope my tolerance wont go up the hill like before my detox/rehab facility. After the nearly 3 month I just needed about 50mg of my dope snortes to nod out for about a hour. Right now I am nodding my ass off too. Cause of the pills and dope. And yes I know the risk of it. I just try to use as less as I can and be on a great plane to the sky. Oh and I wantes to thank the Community here for beeing there everyrytime even with the stupidiest questions. Thanks for that. You guys and gals are so carring, respecting, loving and helpful. This sub shows the world that we ""junkies"" or addicts are much better than so often showm on the news etc. that stigma is so sad. The whole time of my addiction I never stole anything or did anything illegal just to support my habbit. I work 40+ hours a week to support it. And if I dont got enought money for dope I detox in a geat way I found for myself.If youbare jnterersted Ibcan nane a extra post for that txtreme. Long post. I will end it now.

Not in the functions of the two drugs themselves, but how the maintenance programs work.

-With a methadone clinic do you schedule an appointment and see someone like you would a suboxone doctor?

-Do you go daily for your dose, or do doctors prescribe one months supply ever? If they don't, why?

-Generally, does state insurance ever cover methadone like it does Suboxone? If not, how much does it cost?

I've been seeing a therapist and psychiatrist for real problems I have with anxiety, depression and add. 

The first time I saw my psychiatrist, he prescribed me 10mg hydroxyzine to take as needed for anxiety. I saw him a second time and told him I was taking the hydroxyzine everyday before work (6 days/wk) because that's when my social anxiety is the worst. He told me to be careful and that taking it everyday might make it stop working. It's fucking 10mg hydroxyzine for Christ sake.

Have you ever been addicted to anything? Where that one thing provides you with an escape from your shitty reality, or all the happiness you've never felt? Being a drug addict isnt just about getting high. Its about filling up a hole in yourself by using these drugs, and then not wanting to stop because you've finally found a solution after YEARS of searching.

Being an addict is like this:

You find yourself right above water, in a well. Youre kind of safe, theres a decently sized metal plate you can sit/or stand on. Its not big enough for you to get sleep. So of course you can only sleep standing up or sitting down.Theres something else in the water, and every so often it snaps at you. Theres no light from above, its like the well is closed on top. You cant sense anything else but the water, and whatever is lurking inside it.

Eventually you get really thirsty. You know theres water below you, but you dont wanna get attacked by whatever is in it.

Your mouth begins to dry out, and youre starting to get massively dehydrated. You have to stick your hand in the water to drink some of it, or you could just jump in and let whatever it is, kill you. You decide to stick your hand in really quickly, and pull up a small handful of water.

Blissful beautiful water. You quickly gulp it down. But now, you think, whatever is in the water isnt very quick, it cant get me. So you quickly get another handful. But this time you felt something. Right at the tips of your fingers you felt something moist, big, and you think you might have felt a tooth..

So you wait for a little while. You reach your hand back in, pull out some water. Whatever was at the top earlier is gone. So you go back for more, and more. But, the last time you reach in your hand, you felt it again. But it didnt bite you last time. And it didnt bite you the first time. So, fuck it. You grab another handful, seeing the ""thing"" move in the water.

So you reach down once more..

But this time the ""thing"" bites your hand. It wont let go, its teeth are like razor blades, and you yell and scream as you try to pull your hand back. Now youre missing a finger or two.

So you wait yet again. Until youre so thirsty you NEED more water. So back you go, dipping your hand in. Again. And again. But you dont sense anything. So, you lean your head down this time, to drink a bunch of this amazing water. As soon as your head gets near the water, this ""thing"" grabs you by the throat and pulls you under.

Thats what addiction is like to addicts. Heroin takes all your worries away, makes you feel amazing, and gives you everything you need in life; or so it feels like. You feel, This is what you waited your whole life for. But its not. It will destroy your veins, take all your happiness, friends, and family away. Of course you dont care, you're high as shit. But what happens when it runs out or dries up? You're fucked. You're already balls deep in addiction, and theres a small tiny little window you might be able to escape from. But without support from those friends, and your family, you arent getting anywhere.

""Just stop doing drugs"" is like me telling you to ""just stop drinking water"" the people who are addicted, or who use often feel as if they dont have their fix, they will die. Just as you do with no water. Thats why addicts just cant ""stop doing drugs"". Its now rewired their brains to think they need it.",1536141473.0

The day before Halloween 2017 I was going 100mph in my brand new Infiniti q50 red sport. I was sober. Honestly as dumb as this is I had just bought the car a week ago so I figured eh it’s 4am no cops out especially on highway and service roads in my area. (I have a vast background of stunt ridding 600cc bikes. Gto, c6 z06 c5 z06. Completely rebuilt 335i with giant turbos. )

Anyways my confident self was going 99-105 thru and intersection service road to get on the highway. There was a hump in the intersection and since my car wasn’t modded like previous ones it didn’t take it very well. Lost control. Hit the curb my car dies 3 flips. I somehow magically fell out through the drivers side door. Get out the car luckily someone saw. I was only 2 mins away from the hospital and there I went. Oh and they gave me 200mcg fent hcl and literally couldn’t feel any pain at all

Alright that’s enough background. Longer that I thought sorry. Anyways after getting out of hospital 2.5 months later with fractured lumbar spine and complete left leg shattered I was rX oxy 10mg 6-8 times 

This was great for managing my pain now my dr cut me off few months ago. Well I sourced H unfortunately. I just went 2 days  lifke over 60 hours clean and just fucked up again cause I couldn’t deal with the pain and restless legs causing me more pain 

Do you guys think if I go to the same pain management Dr. or maybe even a completely new one. I could get script for at like 1-2 a day.  Or quit being a pussy and start from scratch and. My problem was leaving a little H in my med cabinet. 
Sorry for long post but really need talks opinions. As the pain without anything is almost unbearable. But I haven’t fully gone a week or two. I always bitch out the 3rd 4th day.

Hello guys, i have pretty high opiate tolerance to my own estimation, but i have a anxious mind so i cant help asking this.

Sorry if the forums spirit is more recovery thing, i'm a kratom user myself and just the last 2 weeks i havent had access to it as its illegal in my country (but more should arrive by mail tomorrow) so ive been using different opiates, and i dont like them as much as kratom so im lookin foward to be back on it soon

so here it goes

I took around 10 mg methadone today at 19:00 (yesterday around 20mg, the last week every other day varying 20 or 7mg methadone and mixed in oxys and heroin couple of days) and at 00:00 i took around 30mg oxycontin crushed (snorted around half) . Im now reading scrary threads about methadones high risk of respiratory depression.

Im not especially sedated or anything just bit energetic anxious and kinda chill (fucking oxy ruined the methadon gave some anxious energy)

Should i worry for respiratory depression when i go to sleep? I feel like i have some , but not much when im awake but i fear if i go to sleep it could go worse.

Do you guys have any idea about how long methadone affects respiration ? analgesic effect is around 4-8 and all sources say the respiratory depressive effect peak comes later and lasts longer , but theres no actual hours, so i cant decide when it is safe to go to sleep.

Ås said, im not really sedated at all (which tells of my tolerance) neither yesterday from the 20mg methadon, only energetic.

Can u guys tell me if it should be ok to go to sleep at 6 am? Or should i stay up all night? Åny estimates of the lenght of the respiratory depression?

We can call this more addict behaviour than proper methadone therapy (obviously) so i wouldnt want to consult a doctor at 3 am as i dont have any history of substance abuse and dont want the problems it would cause..

Point is ive done this before with similar doses and didnt die so should i just trust my tolerance? Methadone accumulation is one thing that worries me but as you see from my description i have good tolerance so i dont think the accumulation would be that toxic in this short period yet?

I dont feel sedated at all either, isnt fatal respiratory depression usually with other symptoms also of opioid toxicity?

Now, since I began taking it again, I started taking the 1-2mg every day, because while off the Subs, I started having absolutely horrific insomnia (I'd often go without sleep for 40+ hours, and when I finally did sleep, it was maybe only 3-5 hours)-- so I'm taking them every day now to help me sleep.

Thought I might share it with people going through the same struggle.

Y'all have a wonderful day keep being strong.

 

I need to write out that letter for you who has been a part of my life for almost 6 years now. The first time we met, I had heard things about you. Some people said you were beautiful but hurtful, caring but manipulative, you were holding everything and its contrary. But no matter how many times you were getting called out, it wasn't fear you were making me feel. I was fascinated, I believed in myself enough to think I could experience your beauty while handling your madness. 

Our first exchange was at the time the best moment I had ever lived. Nothing existed anymore, it was just you and me against the entire world. Anywhere I could ever be would feel like the most comfortable spot as long as I was with you. You remember that public bathroom? It was pretty far from romantic I’ll admit, but just the two of us we couldn't be happier. Hiding from the world was also part of the thrill, you were an outlaw with blood on your hands, I didn't plan on ever telling my family about you. I didn't really care about how long it would last, I was just hoping to get something out of our relationship. I guess I was looking for something. As a kid I always dreamed of being above other people's opinions and life obstacles, and I found out spending time with you was helping me with that. I had more and more problems up my ass everyday because of you but I didn't give a damn about them, because of you. 

Came the day I was the most scared of, the day you got blood on your hands again, but this time you'd chosen someone I loved as much as you. We broke up for a while, I wanted to try on reconciling with life after all the shit you'd been throwing at my face for the last couple months. I eventually did, but something was still missing. I was doing great on my own, I had made new friends, a good life was opening its door for me. Maybe I was doing too good, so good that I started talking to some of your friends again. They wouldn't stop reminding me of how good you were, bad memories slowly fading away. At that time I thought you and me needed to have one last talk, just one, so I could get my head around what our story meant. I found you in less than a day, you came to me so easily, like it was the one thing you were waiting for. How dumb could I be to think it would all go well, the addiction started all over again. I couldn't spend twenty-four hours without thinking of you, I needed you, at every second of every day. I believe those few weeks were the ones we’ve been the closest, and that was one hell of a crazy ride. I loved you too much, when I was forced to stay away from you I would sweat, get anxiety, tears in my eye, and believe the sky was going to fall on me. Those things were putting me at risk regarding our secret, I knew that if we kept on being that careless we would lose absolutely everything we had. I didn't want to lose you, I just wanted you to stay away for a little while. Which you did, mostly because we knew we would get together again someday. It ended up happening like we said it would, you came back. How am I supposed to live without you, all these years you’ve been there allowing me to bear everything around. You occupy so much room in my mind, telling me sweet words but I know what they hiding. I know. That's the problem, I know you're no good to me, I know I would waste my life away if I stayed with you. I know. So why am I here again searching for a vein?
