My friend in Tucson AZ claims he can score some china, and he says it's very strong. I'm finding this sorta sketch and hard to believe, but I will have the opportunity to try it tomorrow. 

Has anyone out here in the southwest seen white powdered dope (aside from DNM orders)? I've only ever been able to buy black (straight tar and gunpowder), and I'm a little concerned that this might be fent (two of his friends OD'd off it in one week). Maybe tomorrow I can update w some pics.

All I had to prepare for this day was an abysmally small rinse left from yesterday. During my first class, I see that i've gotten a direct deposit into my account for $100! Unfortunately, $60 of that has to go towards materials for school, but that's okay, I still have $40 to spend. Being an irresponsible junkie, I've used up all my absences in all my classes, so if I miss another class I automatically fail. This makes it very hard to score when I'm occupied all day and busses only run until 7pm (I need to travel to a town about 30 minutes away AND go to the bank to withdraw the cash, so there's no way i'd have time after class.) I thought about buying through my local middleman, because I would have enough time to get there and back to class during my break. But it's so hard to buy that small ass ""40 bag"" that is DEFINITELY not a full .4 when I know my actual dealer in the other town will give me a full gram of much better quality stuff. So I resign myself to the fact that i'll simply have to save the money, take my sleeping aid tonight and cop tomorrow. Randomly, my dealer texts me asking if I need anything and how much. I told him I have $40 but no way to get to him or the bank. (Side note: this dealer is straight dominican and speaks very little english, so conversations are always difficult and i'm never sure if he completely understands what I say.) He responded: ""I bring to you. one gram. okay my friend? okay."" So I gave him my address and he said he would be there in 40 minutes. There are so many exciting things about this, and one of the best is that it only took an hour! That's pretty decent by dealer time. So he shows up at my place and I give him directions to the bank (we spent the ride there teaching him english words that were hard for him to pronounce, like ""swallow."" He was telling me that he has to swallow the bags if the police ever come, and once he had to swallow 25 half grams, but he couldn't pronounce the word, just made a swallowing motion) Anyways, I get the 40 out and he gives me a gram and says ""okay and I give you one bolsa free for you okay?"" So I end up with a gram and a half of fire for $40 and I didn't have to go anywhere. Sorry this was so long i'm just so excited and wanted to share! :)

Update: thanks everyone for convincing me to go to the hospital. I'm at the ER waiting for the test results. They did a urine test and blood test.

Update #2: the test results came back. Everything is normal. I ended up telling them that my corset/waist training was causing me abdominal and back pain so I took a bunch of Tylenol.

That's depressing.,"Opiates are fascinating to me. I look at all you people and am amazed that such a sub culture exists, and the type of people that you are. 16-25 year old, thin, white, middle class kids. It's hilarious when you hold the true image up against the pantomime that is the media image. So sad how they misconstrue it to us in school because it's nowhere near the truth. 

I've only done any sort of opiate, oxycodone really, about 10 times over a period of over a year. 

I tried SSRIs. They do an ok job of dulling your senses, making you care less. They're not even really good at making you productive. They just put a floor on the lows that you can experience. They make you feel less like yourself. Oxycodone makes me feel more like myself. I feel like I feel I should feel. It's not euphoric. Instead of feeling like a 3 all the time, I feel like a 7. And that's better than feeling like a 10 in a way, because then you're just manic, or doped up beyond functionality. I'm not anxious, I'm not hateful, I'm less afraid, I'm more optimistic, all just really excellent things. 

I get that it's not quite the same for all cases. Shooting up is something completely different, but am I off base in saying this is what opiate users are seeking, by and large? Getting super high once in awhile may be appealing, but not all the time. It's about feeling normal, not being depressed, it's a drug that seems to appeal to people who probably felt kinda shitty most of the time even before they became addicted. 

It's just a shame about the physical addiction and money issues. HA. I understand what happens to the addicts. Initial addiction goes something like this: I've done other things, I'm stronger than that, I would never let myself develop a real problem, after all, the borderline between having a real problem and just using a little is soooooooooo distinct (sarcasm, because I know some will miss that). Then you like it, you figure using it 3 times in a week is ok, you do that for two weeks, and by week 3 you're using every day, because, it's ok, it's just for a little while, you'll be back to using 3 times a week next week. And then you're addicted, ta da. 

Just in case anyone was wondering if I had any perspective at all. Being not an addict I can't really understand fully, but I do feel like I kind of get it.

Even though I relapsed I don't really feel bad about it for some reason, I relapsed cause I was bored basically lol. I am not too worried either cause I have suboxone maintenance.  I sniff but I also plug sometimes too when I have the time (pretty good over sniffing imo despite the hassle)

I went to the pharmacy to get some oral syringes... and I see these boxes of syringes/needles on the top shelf.... I am fantasizing how good IV dope would be. I find out that my state you can buy syringes over the counter.... should I? Sniffing is doing me fine, and so is plugging lol. But man people keep saying how much money they save from IV and the rush... it seems so appealing for some reason and although I never thought I would stick a needle in my arm ever I am contemplating it right now. 

I know most of the general consensus would be no, but from a logical perspective is it really that bad? /r/opiates what should I do? I am 21 years old btw with virgin veins.

I'm not new to opioids but this is the year I fell in love with heroin.,"I have some questions I'd like answered and I'm going to give my input on a few things that relate to sweet lady H. 

First started experimenting with codeine after doing some research while baked- used to love to smoke up then read Erowid for hours...

I feel in love with the poppy plant for a number of reasons and not just cause it provides great recreational drugs. I'm obsessed with medicine and drugs in general but the culture, music, the writers, the history...I could go on but you get the idea.. pot used to be my favorite plant and it's still a very useful medicine and hemp is very important but for recreational use the poppy plant is my favorite plant. It was only this year that I started using heroin regularly tho. It wasn't really a response to some rough times it was something I started using AFTER I WAS HEALING FROM A BAD BREAKUP- complete with lies, slander and very cruel behavior. You know when people say 'drugs became his whole focus' or 'all i cared about was the drugs' heroin is my focus when it comes to my favorite drug but as far as my interests when I get high-just as when I still used pot my interests come alive...and especially with heroin, read for hours doing heroin, watch docs, play guitar. post on reddit :P

here's my poppy history in time saving form

Experiment with codeine(realize some the the greatest pleasure I've ever known> learn more about poppies>grow poppies in my parents yard and buy poppy pods online all the time>years later buy kratom for 140$ including shipping> do various pills over the years but not many- here in Vancouver I never came across much selection and trust me I tried. (Did hydromorphone a number of times cause my friend's Dad had some left over after surgery, easily my favorite pill ever wish I could have lots did some oxycondone here and there but always the 20mgs footballs and such...never percs, never vicodan ..i did get a couple of full bottles of morphine before and these 100mgs morphine pills were awesome but I was so fucking ignorant I was eating them... I think I knew they were weaker this way but I had so many and 100mgs always made me feel good, but these days I regret it, if i had them again I'd be plugging huge doses. 

I did heroin once with my little bro a well over a year ago, and before that about 7 years ago I did it twice in my friend's garage other than than I didn't touch it. seemed like a fast acting drug but I wasn't blown away... he was also getting low quality dope but hey I did get really high as I had no  tolerance. This year I got a couple of phone numbers and my love affair with sweet lady H began in earnest. :) 

I'm trying to be concise after what many considered my trainwreck of a first post under this account name, and what others probably considered a trolling attempt. 

Here are questions and opinions about sweet, sweet dope. 

**What's the most cash you've spent in 2 days or over the weekend?**

After using a fuck of a lot lately I've realized I need a break, even just to cut my tolerance but also cause I consider spending $80 twice in a few days a loss, and I mean why not just spend the whole $160 at once? then I could at least fondle a nice full gram. sometimes I blow thru a bag like a .3 for $50 too fast and then get upset and get one the next day. when this first started I got so fucking high from messing with a .3 bag that I would go to brush my teeth or something in the bathroom....look into the mirror..drift into thought and nod out and smash my head on the mirror. 

|Good times, and the funny thing is I'm not joking-i just should have been sitting at the time **I FELT AMAZING** at the time. I need to cut back so I can go on serious nods again. 

Sadly I bet if I got an iv kit up the road tomorrow I'd be nodding all week. hmm..

**Do you iv, ever tempted to?-I've been very close at times and all I would have to do is walk literally less than 3 blocks (monday - friday) and I would get a full kit for free. ** not just needles but alcohol swabs, litle water jars, an elstic to tie off, cookers...fucking everything and all for free.


also, those free crack pipes commonly given out, **are those usually glass?** cause I could skip the brillo and shit
and just pop my dope in and hear from the side,

i like using the glass tubes that come with droppers and I've purchused little dropper bottles from the herbal shop before but those little glass tubes don't last long as pipes. 

i love how fast that thin glass works tho, and how they fill with white buildup you can hit after your little chunks of heroin are gone. 
**HOT SHOTS VERSUS COLD SHOTS- AND DO NASAL USERS NEED TO GIVE A FUCK** - SO FAR.. i don't.

Some people who use nasally with a water and heroin mix will use a syringe but I use droppers, some of thos people cook thier shit as tho they are preparing a shot.


I have seen people saying a hot shot can make cut go into your shit and on heroin helper he says a cold shot can risk bacterial infection etc..


what's the truth with iv, but besides that and most important for me if i can snort dry powder why should I worry about liquid and heroin going up my nose?

I don't store the water long it sits in a little super tiny jar about as big as the tip of my pinky, it was an old pot oil bottle. 

I use it up and then change the water by adding dope and fresh water. 


**Do i really need to bother cooking what is just a water bump?**

And what about people doing iv. cold or hot shots?
what's proper? 

The only reason I have been tempted to iv is cause it's economical- but for now I've just tried to just be as efficient as possible when i use and to take breaks.... confine my use(or most)to the evenings ..etc. 

I really, really like taking a fat toke of heroin but I chase carefully and I'm always building a new pipe that uses just enough heat from the lighter and never too much, over time I've reminded myself over and over more water bumps less tokes more water bumps less tokes...it's easy to smoke my way through too much. Meanwhile, with my little jar(used to have hash oil in it-one of those) and dropper setup I save money and prolong and achieve a better high. **CHASING REALLY IS THAT...CHASING.... ** a couple of tokes here and there really add to the high but I now prefer the bottle and water dropper setup. Sure, people talk about the high from smoking, ...but not only does my dropper add more legs to the high but I like making some strong 'Holy Water'(heroin water) and then taking little drops of it (it really is a art, add just enough and never too much...just what you need and can absorb and not too much that it runs down my throat) I knock back a nice series of these water bumps back to back and 5-ten minutes in I'm feeling really, really g^_^d 

and while I love those chasing hits chasing seems more 'fiendish' and shortlived so I mix it with water bumps as I call them which is just using the droper as I described above. 

Through trial and error I've found the depths that seem to be most effective for me - and yes each side of my nose is jusssssst a little different :P

Lastly, I've seen people say the perfect colour for a shot or water you're going to bump is like a well hydrated person's pee. I disagree with that, a well hydrated person's pee is when I've been adding heroin and more water as I go and I'm running out... a person that should be drinking more water is the colour of the shit I like to bump  , it's fine to bump yellow that's what I have right now and I will be sleeping soon and I am already HIGH AS FUCK earlier I was bumping yellow-orange, another test I have is a taste a single drop and I've gotten to the point that I know exactly how I wanted it to taste and what kind of night I'm in for via that taste, give or take a little.

I'm always getting nunber #4 heroin and while it might rarely be cut with a little bit of #3...tho I wouldn't know the dope I buy is always white or off white. 

It comes in little solid chunks and it's lightyears away from the 'whiteish' powder I was getting from some'kids' before I tried a new number and started getting my dope off some older folks that seem to sell to pay for their own and they do the same dope I do.   

I'm also fascinated with the trip heroin takes to  get inside my body, I always wonder did this shit come  Afghan opium? Mexico is a major poppy producer now believe it or not...I wonder how the heroin itself was smuggled, can't wait to use Dark Markets ..should be able to erase part of the mystery, save lots of money and get closer to the source all at the same time. Kinda simple but I have a few various small containers and mini jars I'd like to pack full of dope. Sure would be nice to take a self imposed break but be able to pop a tiny jar open and be able to bust a line  and pack my little heroin pipe-which is just a vape bowl turned around i stuff little chunks of dope into the glass stem heat from below and draw in thru the bowl. in some weird ghetto way it reminds me of the way opium pipes would work.

One of the pictures is of the three bags I gripped, and another picture is one of the Sonic bags broken down into a fat line - these bags were 'average' and were chubby but not as fat as the Turbo guys do things. 


This is for two stamps, Arizona and Sonic. I pave gotten Sonic before, but rumor has it the quality has gone down a good deal. I got two bags of Sonic and Two bags barely got me where I wanted to be. The Arizona bag is from he same area, but I found it to be complete garbage. It didn't do anything besides keep me well for a few hours. Would not buy either of these again when there are quality stamps just a few blocks further away.

Sonic (white stamp that says ""Sonic"" in a ziplock Baggie)
High:6.7
Count:7.2

Arizona (blue stamp that says ""Arizona"" in a ziplock Baggie)
High:3.5
Count:5
The high for this bag was extremely short lived, not sure if it is cut with a lot of cut, or just crappy dope.


I'll keep this one short, definitely need to ask some of the old heads and people I see out often where all the new good dope is.

I did some searching and most the info I could find on plugging was related to oral syringes, but I don't have access to one right now. I have been laying on the beach in Andulcia for the past week living the dream. I can say that because I'm originally from upstate NY where we get slammed with snow and horrible weather starting about the end of September. Anyways, I got my hands on some OC 10s, old formula here in EU. I've been snorting all of them but I fear my tolerance has risen to a point where snorting is not the most effective method. Na, I won't IV, not yet at least. My question is: it's obviously possible to plug with only your index finger, but how far up do I go with it? Is there a directikn or specific place I should be targeting? I've never put anything up there before. Does an oral syringe really make that much of a difference? Do you think I should bite the bullet and buy an oral syringe? Or can I get away without it? 
Thanks for the advice & suggestions.

It is about 2 and half weeks into my heroin binge. I just relapsed 2 and a half weeks ago after 1.5 years of clean time with the help of suboxone maintenance, still haven't got the needle but at this rate it's only a matter of time if I don't do something. I have been snorting 10-12 lines a day, usually 4-5 sessions....

I thought I could chip, and I haven't even gone one day without using. At first it was awesome going through that honeymoon phase again. Getting high for 5-8 hours feeling amazing. Opiates really were my doc, sadly, dealing with my depression/anxiety so well/bad. 

At first I felt like nothing was wrong shortly after relapsing. I relapsed not cause things were going shitty, man things were going well. I did it cause I was BORED.... what a piece of shit reason to relapse, just was curious to feel that opiate blanket again. Still are I guess despite the fact I'm addicted to heroin again. Avoiding my problems and procrastination and caused a lot of static in my life where I could have achieved so much, and with the heroin it's like 10x worse. I have feelings of self-loathing again, even if I am high. I am high as I type this enjoying my nod but I regret it. 

I am a coward, I know eventually I will have to stop my use. Even if I had an infinite heroin supply I realize now I wouldn't be happy. The tolerance and mental changes are just too much. I thought I could handle heroin, thought even using it would make me a stronger person in the long run. Boy was I fucking stupid. I still am.. I didn't need this in my life again. I have suboxone for when I stop but I am so fucking scared of facing withdrawals again even with it. Nobody even knows I relapsed. So it's going to suck when I stop and have to explain why I'm so down in the dumps.  I am a coward.

I know that they will be giving me my first dose that day, and told me to have 48-72hr's of no use prior to coming in. 
I found a guy right now who has some suboxone, and was considering stopping my dope use today, and buying some subs tomorrow to last me until Friday. I'm skeptical about doing this because I know I will get a drug test when I first go in and don't know if they would still be willing to treat me if I have suboxone in my system. Would I still be able to be treated if that was the case? Or should I just continue my dope use as normal until my visit? I would really like to stop dope, and start subs as soon as possible so I hope just starting subs tomorrow would be alright? Also, if it turns out that I should just keep using dope until my visit, would it be alright if I had <48hr's before my last use? I was thinking about taking my last shot on Thursday morning at around 10am, and would then have a good 25hr's of no use before my visit. 

How long do appointments usually take? Does health insurance generally cover this sort of thing? What dose do people usually receive? 

Any info regarding any of this would be greatly appreciated. 

Edit (formatting, and another question): Would they care about any other drugs in my system that are not opiates such as THC, cocaine, xanax, ext. I haven't done much of anything else in a while. Then again I'm not sure how far back their tests extend, and I would be really sad if some blow I did a couple weeks ago made me ineligible.  ",1415056622.0

""When the Crimson Cloud Blooms""


Alone with my sorrow

and a carbon coated spoon

I forget about tomorrow

once the crimson cloud blooms

A tourniquet to stop the bleeding

of severed thoughts in the act of breeding

My rotting veins distending, swollen with doom

I get a taste of the grave

when the crimson cloud blooms.

It's a kiss of bliss concealed in a pin prick,

too much or too little will both leave me sick.

An entire lifetime of love is consumed

when I push in that plunger

after the crimson cloud blooms.

These track guide the train straight to the station,

a derailing collision of mind numbing sensation.

Tank treads designed to exhume

all the tragedy and horror

when the crimson cloud blooms.

In the land of Nod I have nodded to death

and that death rattle resides

within each rasping breath.

I am flotsam adrift in the fetid waters of womb

and I find myself drowning

each time that crimson cloud blooms.

The insatiable gluttony has me pining for more

despite of this maelstrom devouring the shore

and this torrent has taken me straight into the tomb

and never again will that crimson cloud bloom.

THIS IS GOING TO BE A LONG POST, YOU'VE BEEN WARNED/INFORMED



I ended up getting divorced (common law)in the middle or March this year and it's been the most painful and confusing thing I've ever been through, she didn't just break up with me she went out of her way to hurt me over and over after the breakup and lied about me , a lot. I even caught her on tape saying-when i wouldn't let her in to grab a blanket, she had a;ready taken the bed and she owes me $100- that she would lie to the landlord that I willingly let her in even though she slipped past someone else, that SHE KNEW USING THE WORD ***ABUSE*** IN BOLD, CAPITAL LETTERS ON HER STUPID BLOG WOULD MAKE IT LOOK LIKE I BEAT THE SHIT OUT OF HER... She admitted as we spoke through the door that it may make people think i abused her physically, but she welcomed that and actually meant 'nagging' fucking nagging...from the girl who hit me and had 'anger issues' for years, years I put up with as she grew up and got better. 

Out of frustration when I said ""what do you want me to do, kill myself?"" she said back through the door ""oh good now I can call the police and say you're threatening to hurt yourself and when they open the door I can take the blanket"". She already took the bed and 3 out of 4 cats. I admitted my own faults but when I suggested she consider some of her own -while I was helping her move heavy totes she couldn't carry downstairs- she exploded. I explained to her that while the recent turn into 

Anyway, needless to say it's been a very rough year and we were in a rough spot but when she shutdown, stopped communicating , talked about an open relationship and then backed off the idea after a long talk I thought we weron the right track again...

Then one day when cleaning up the bedroom I saw that her computer was open, it was a shared computer she knew that I used it for for the World Community Grid computing project and such, but when I opened it her facebook messages were right there and I could see a conversation she was having with this dick,... it was all in my favor ""he makes me see the bigger things in life"" ""I still love him"" ...""we've been together for 8 years and I need to give this an honest try""

But when I told her what I saw-rather than keeping it to myself she blew up and flipped out. I should have said nothing and kept it to myself but I called her at work to ask her about it, seems she had been to his house when she told me she only went to out for coffee a few times. 

DO YOU UNDERSTAND HOW PAINFUL IT IS THAT THIS GUY ADDED ME DURING THE TIME OF OCCUPY VANCOUVER AND I ACCEPTED HIS REQUEST? - he's the one that planted the open relationship ideas in her head, he's the one that got her to pull away from me rather than talk and work on our problems, problems that only arose near the end of our relationship. 

Needless to say this whole thing has totally fucked me right up. For the first few months I didn't use any drugs at all, nothing, zip, zero, zilch. Not even pot. But at one point I started having a few drinks at my best friend's house on Fridays just to ease the stress, the alcohol practically got me sober, I went from fucking shaking and flipping out to being able to sit for an hour and watch a tv show or talk about how I was feeling. 

The way she broke up with me, blogging about me, and then posting it all to facebook, blocking me but then coming back to my page to post with one of her many puppets she created over the years so that she could cheat at her stupid facebook games.

She blamed me for fucking everything, she only played so many games because of ,me, our apt was messy cause of me, not cause she brought home all this fucking junk all the time. I wouldn't let her get a large garbage can? well I wanted to grow mushrooms again and a small can means you have to  bring out the waste all the time instead of letting it pile up thus the air in your home is cleaner, is that so bad? 

She wanted so many cats but then I was a dictator cause I reminded her to clean their boxes because she agreed before getting them that she would. She didn't just 'air dirty laundry' she posted the sexual details of the people she slept with after me.

I dated a girl that struggled with her weight for 8 years, and for 8 years I put up with a girl who got better over time both physically and mentally but I will admit there were times I would have a long shower and think, ....IS THIS IT? IS THIS ALL THERE IS FOR ME? 

I MISSED HER SO MUCH AT FIRST but she went out of her way to hurt me again and again after we broke up and that helped me fall out of love cause I was able to stop romanticizing her.

I will never put my needs second again, if a girl isn't exactly who I want to be with inside and out I will wait until I find the right girl. I'd like to date a cute Asian girl that actually challenges me mentally, someone truly special. 

My little brother was back into using meth wayyy too heavily(-personally I have met and I am a responsible opioid user but I always see bad things happen with meth in the end, always) when he gave me a number for heroin, before this I had smoked it twice in 10 years and I snorted some with him once(he's another long story, he treated me like shit for 2 months while he lived with me, the whole deal when it comes to a problem meth head, acting like a dick, coming over just to eat my food and crash... i paid him 2 grams of rub just as a reminder to pay me back some of the $150 he owed me for all the weed fronting I did for him... and of course he never did. He went so hard and for so long that he ended up in the psych ward after he left my place and was then transferred to place that deals with addiction s and mental illness... BUT OF COURSE HE ENDED UP WITH SOME HOT GIRL FRIEND THAT HE MET IN THE PSYCH WARD....my older bro asked me if I am happy for him and was surprised to find out I am not. I am the middle child and my brother that was the meth addict is the younger brother... he does everything wrong and has for years and somehow things work out for him , he is the Kramer of our family)

I won't take it for weeks at a time so that I can take them all at once in one day. It's dumb, but it's not heroin so I don't feel so bad about it.

Side note before I begin: **DO NOT TAKE BENZOS WITH ALCOHOL! IT IS A VERY DANGEROUS COMBINATION**

So without further ado, here is what I wrote:

Theory: Benzodiazapines are fucking retarded. 


**Failed Attempt #1.**


 Sunday’s dumbass extravaganza began and ended with 8mg Xanax sublingually. Not much is remembered. My belief is that I fell asleep sometime during the evening between 5:00-7:00 PM with it being more likely to have occurred closer to 7:00 PM than to 5:00 PM, but my recollection of the event is too unreliable to definitively say. I had awoken at 12:00 AM very confused. All I thought that had happened was that I simply fell asleep for 5 or 6 hours in my chair. I don’t recall doing anything else or having any type of communication with anybody. My search history is empty during this time period. I have no type of record or evidence that could propose that I were doing anything or was located anywhere else other than in my chair. The only strange unsolved mystery is the whereabouts of the glass that I had been drinking juice out of. Had I hidden it or misplaced it during my haze? Did my mother come into my room and take the glass out of my room for me? If she did, I surely have no recollection of it. Did I ever leave my room to have a cigarette or perhaps do something else? I remember nothing. After waking up at around 12:00, I fell back asleep until roughly 10:00 AM the next morning. Thus begins Failed Attempt #2.


**Failed Attempt #2.** 


It was Monday morning at 10:00 AM. I still felt groggy and confused from last night’s failed attempt.
I took 4mg around 10:30 A.M under the assumption that I would have the house to myself momentarily and that the Xanax would fully kick in by the time everybody in my house was gone. I vaguely recall much of anything after that. I believe that I had grown impatient that people were still at my house and I had decided to lie down and browse the internet until everybody had left, in which I then would have begun my preferred morning ritual of drinking coffee with a cigarette, and then smoking weed. Contrarily, I believe that I fell asleep very shortly after I began browsing the internet. The next thing I remember is waking up at around 3:45-4:00 PM with no recollection of anything except for that I had been sleeping. Just like Sunday night, I had failed again and fell victim to Father Sleep.


**Attempt #3**


I intend to make tonight different from the previous two attempts in the sense that I am going to refuse to allow myself to fall asleep until I am absolutely sure that there are no positive effects to gain from taking Xanax.

12:25 – 1 mg Xanax taken sublingually


12:35 – 1 mg Xanax taken sublingually


12:44 – 1 mg Xanax taken sublingually


1:32 – Feeling the effects take hold. Still not nearly as intense as desired.


1:35 – 1mg Xanax taken sublingually. This will be my final dose.

 
**4 MG in Total**


1:46 - The final 1mg of Xanax has dissolved and will be chased down with the juice momentarily.


2:26 – Took two decently sized shots of vodka. Feeling alright. Nothing major yet.


3:12- Smoked a fat bowl of high quality weed. Am very high, feeling intoxicated. Might drink more vodka.


3:15 – Just took a large gulp of vodka. I think I should call it quits on the alcohol for the night. It was a large gulp, possibly being equivalent to three shots, possibly even. 4.


If I die. I didn’t mean to die. I just wanted to get as inebriated as possible. To escape my troubles. I am sorry. I love you all.

Thank you to my family. Thank you Charles Bukowski. Thank you Hunter S. Thompson. Thank you Louis C.K. Blacks and Jews.
Looks like I gambled and lost, eh, (name disclosed)?


(Cigarette break)

3:52 – Took another big gulp of vodka with no chaser. I truly am an addict. I am only happy when I’m not sober, at least it often times seems to feel like that.
I’m surprisingly not too uncoordinated. That’s the only thing looming in my head still that is preventing me from believing that I have consumed too many drugs, that being Xanax and alcohol (marijuana doesn’t count in my opinion). Now if I were to be dropping things or falling over, unable to properly make a complete sentence, then I’d be worried. But fuck it. I have been referred to by others as a “medical mystery”. The vast majority of drugs that I have taken always ended up requiring a higher dosage to take full effect on me, while half as much as what I took completely inebriated my friends. Sometimes, things just go that way for you. The biggest curse that an addict can have is a naturally high tolerance. It automatically starts them off one level ahead of everybody else. When he needs to buy a $40 bag, the others only need to buy a $20 bag. It is only inevitable for things to get worse and worse as times goes on.


I know what I’m doing with drugs. I know why. I’m not saying it is rational, but what I *am* saying is that there *is* a reason. For the last few years of my life, I have failed at finding something or someone that makes me feel good inside. Then I discovered heroin. For the first time in my life. I felt good on the inside. And until I find something else that makes me feel as good inside as heroin does, “I ain’t gonna fuckin’ quit it.” I know now that regardless, another inevitable thing about quitting is that you will have to do it, or your life will be an eternal world of suffering. 


So, I've quit heroin. 30 days clean today. It doesn’t seem to mean like much to me. I don’t feel as proud or accomplished as others might think that I should be. I still smoke pot. I still take Xanax on occasion once, maybe twice per week. But you know what? I’m fucking happy with that. I’m not panicking all day long anymore trying to find a way to come up with an extra $13 so I can cop a 40 bag. Weed is much cheaper. $40 of weed will last me for a couple weeks, maybe longer. 
So, fuck it. I’m doing better now than I was doing 30 days ago.


4:51 AM – I’d say that tonight ended up well. I smoked one last fat bowl of weed. I smoked my final cigarette of the night as well. I've been contently high for the last hour or so. I found the perfect, if not close to it, recipe for a good Xanax, alcohol, and marijuana cocktail. I feel fine. I feel alright. I’m O.K with that. For the rest of the time I simply relaxed, lounging back in my chair, softly listening to the great Tom Waits.


There’s a lot of work that needs to be done. I've got a long list of things that I need to accomplish and it will not be easy. It’s going to be a lot of very hard work. But I must do it. Why choose to be a failure when it’s simply only an option, not an inevitability? Success and Happiness are two other options and they as well are not an inevitability. Pick one or the other. One will be a life of cheap thrills and dead dreams. The other with love, fun, stability, and no regrets.

Thank you for reading,

Jim.

Right now, I'm just gonna enjoy the ride like the reckless, irresponsible, invincible kid that I am. I'd be lying, though, if I said I hadn't stuck my head out the window and seen that the tracks run out a ways up ahead,  and the path keeps going right into thin air above an 800ft drop into a rocky gorge. 

Now, I know I'm invincible and immortal and all...but that doesn't mean I can't feel pain! Also, I know the whole immortality thing is a bit tricky; I honestly wouldn't be too surprised if I found out the second the train went flying over the edge of that gorge, that my invincibility had just chosen that moment to conveniently expire. 

So I sigh to myself, and figure we had a fun ride while it lasted, me and this train. It was a messed up train too, seeing as it had only been steadily racing faster and faster since we first met, and none of my attempts to slow it down had been successful for more than a couple seconds at most. Nope, the train and I hadn't been going at a sustainable acceleration for a while now anyways...so I had been thinking about preparing my goodbyes long before the 800 ft. drop convinced me. 

All of that doesn't mean I can't sit back and enjoy the final few minutes of my complete and perfect invincibility, as the train hits record speed. Before I jump.",1415130782.0

I have a few decent ones myself, but mainly in the areas of escape and arrest, as I have so far eluded any actual time served. But I find that usually these are my favorite kind of stories to hear when my friends and I get together and shoot the shit. The sort of thing that vicariously gets your blood pumping because of how crazy it is.

Alright, so I'll go first. Last year around winter time I was rolling into Paterson to pick up the finest fire I could find. I had no gas and $120 exactly for 3 bundles, so I returned something I bought but hadn't opened yet (no it wasn't stolen, just a shitty bottle of hair dye I had) to get $4.75 to put in my tank. So with the needle just hovering below an eighth of a tank, I took off. My dealer told me to park and wait for him. If anyone else has been down there in the winter, you know that shit doesn't get plowed, and I fucking got stuck in ice. In a panic with no gas to spare I got out and tried to push off. No go. Luckily some short stout man with a shovel saw MW and helped me out. But after doing so he said ""wait...are you from here?"" And I said ""nope visiting friends"" and then dipped out. Met my guy at a slightly less shitty corner and then blasted back towards NY. I saw a cop waiting at the on-ramp and got a bad feeling. But it seemed like I lost him after 10 minutes so I turned the system up and took off. Big fucking mistake. A minute later I hear that soul crushing whoop whoop behind me. In a fit of rage I decide I'm not going to jail that night and stash the dope while looking for a safe spot to pull over. I have a nice alibi about meeting friends at the hookah bar prepared. So a couple cops get out and want to talk so I roll down the window (which is broken btw, and won't go back up). The first thing he says is ""I pulled you over for doing 90..."" I was so beyond fucked. 90 in a 60, 3 bundles of dope hastily stashed and more patrol cars pulling up. So I pull the sad stupid kid who made a mistake bit, and tell the story about the hookah bar. I offered to let them search my car, and don't waver on one bit of the story. After 15 minutes of him trying to run my ID he says the station is busy and not able to process it at the moment. He gives me my lice sent back and tells me to drive more carefully next time and sends me on my way. I could not believe my luck. I then cautiously drove home (stopping at a fast food place to do a couple bags after I safely made it back to my own state), but had to neutral down the last hill towards my road because I was literally out of gas. But I fucking made it.

I guess the moral of the story is something along the lines of play dumb and sad if police pull you over. Or maybe its just that deities love junkies who share what they got, so be generous. Fuck I don't know. But I have a shit ton of these stories where I escape by the skin of my teeth, or get charged with a lot less than I should and get off with an ACD in court.

I then started looking at posts here. Most are from users and showing drugs and stuff. I thought, fuck. They're gonna do what every other place would do and basically tell me to get fucked or post elsewhere as this is for users or something. I swore that's how it would go down. I almost didn't post.

My questions are, why do you think that is? Why is this community so open to quiting etc? Is it because, and this is just how it seems from the outside looking in, that pretty much everyone here has probably had to withdrawal at some point so they know how bad it sucks? Or is it that most want to quit but can't? I'm just generally curious. Not trying to say anything bad about the wanting to quit part if that sounds wrong. Also, does this sub do general discussions or back story threads? I think that could be really cool. Telling how you got where you are. What you think about it etc. Might help other users who have been or are going through some shit. Could also talk about funny shit that's happened while high or something.

I use triptans but when they don't work I use percocets 10/325.

Bad, bad 45 days. A variety of triggers. He was in the loop.  Two appts. in 30 days.  He knew what was up.  The guy is NEVER in his office and not available.  Impossible to see.

I got into a migraine stream that lasted 4 days and he was unreachable. Not responding to triptans, ibuprofen, percs.  Ended up in the ER. Got dilaudid. First time doing that. 

I have been on every preventative known to man.

He would not see me after my ER visit. No appts available til dec. Meanwhile, migraine comes back. I walked into his office without an appt. and he hastily writes a script for prednisone which I have taken before which was really hard on me. I also had to take it TWICE recently for root canal infection. That would make it three times in 1 year - not good for the body.  He said take that if the migraine I have now continues.  Does not want to give me any more percocet.

Hell, percocet? I was going to ask for something STRONGER than percocet at this point.

I don't think I was in percocet rebound as I was taking triptans when the migraine got worse with just percs to try to sleep.  But they aren't helping much either. 

It's clear he's over it. 

Do I ask for a referral to pain management at this point?  He seemed irritated I dropped in on him (after he did not return my call for 48 hours after I spend the night in the ER and could not get a call back, and then was told by his staff he would not see me until Dec.)

I could get a new neuro, but I have to wait for a referral from my primary doc, which means another appt., insurance approval, and starting over.

And meanwhile, day two of new migraine, and he said do NOT take any more triptans this week. Since I have no percocet, what should I take?  I might go back to the ER I guess.  The IV was nice but the waiting room was horrific.

Which type of dr. prescribes whatever is stronger than percocet 10 and how can I get in to see one? I have extremely detailed paperwork for the last 15 years (I'm a type A personality), but not a lot of time as my work is suffering.

Normally, I have no problems dealing with this and simply hoping for better luck the next day. However, today was especially hard because I had court this morning for something absolutely stupid that I had done (which surprisingly had nothing to do with my opiate addiction), which had me pretty damn stressed (just noticed that 'stressed' backwards is 'desserts'; neat) out.

Anyway; I came home after court and got back in bed, slowly anticipating the inevitable withdrawals that come with a 40-60mg oxymorphone/day habit. Not even an hour after laying down, I got a text from a person who I'm able to make enough money middle-manning for to afford at least one Opana 40.Junkie Jesus was smiling down on me today; because in the end, I was able to buy two Opana 40s.

However, not even buying the pills came as easy as I had hoped for. I called my primary connect, and they told me I would have to be there in 10 minutes because they were on their way out of the door to a doctor's appointment. I was 20 minutes away; but I headed that way anyway, since my secondary connect lives right around the corner. As I expected, my primary was long gone by the time I made it there.

On my way to my secondary, I saw his kid's mom, who said that he was out of town to re-up. At this point, I could feel the withdrawals begin to take hold of me; my body knowing good and well that we were going to have to wait for primary to make it back home. Waiting is always the worst when you have literally no idea how long you'll have to do so.

However, before my mind could even finish my hopeless thoughts, secondary's baby mama gave me information that made me want to kiss her: there was somebody else up the street with Opana 40s for the same price, and they were home for sure. Even better, it was somebody that I used to deal with in the past, meaning I wouldn't have to worry about giving my money to a middleman and risk getting ripped off.

We made the < 5 minute drive to his house, and I picked up two 40s and got his phone #. I wasted no time shaving one of the pills up with my trusty hose clamp to sniff with the person who gave me the ride. Nothing is sweeter than feeling that sickness being slowly lifted from your body.

So, here I am. Feeling good on a Wednesday (I am Lorde; yah yah yah!); knowing that I still have another Opana to keep the sickness at bay for a little bit longer than usual.

Now, let's see if I can practice restraint and self-control by holding onto this other pill until the morning; knowing that if I go ahead and do it tonight, I'll end up nodding out long enough to wake up sober and hating myself for not saving it.

I was surprised that dude had the Actavis 230 ""half-moon"" 40s, since everybody else I deal with has the Global G74s. I love the Gs, but it honestly feels like the Actavis 230s have way longer legs. Of course, it's probably all in my head.

**TL;DR**-- For the first time in a long time, I was able to buy myself more than one Opana today. Meaning that I can enjoy my current dose, knowing that I have another to keep the sickness away for even longer than usual.",1415233938.0

But so fucking dangerous and I see that too now...because when that rush is over you want it again...really bad.

I'd take a drive over to the nearest pharmacy, and put in a good, hard bit of work breaking through all those metal cages and locked drawers. Afterwards, I'd head down to the Ferrari dealership that's near my area, grab a brand new 458, and spend the rest of my days cruising around at 180 miles per hour, nodding into oblivion.

Any advice support etc. Or just someone to talk to about anything. I'm losing my shit. (xpost from /r/opiatewithdrawal","Hi guys. So, I'm technically on my first day of withdrawal. Yesterday I had 3 tramadol 50s so I guess it's only right to make this my first day. A quick bit of information. I've been through opiate withdrawal before. I was broke and pretty much just suffered though it. I was able to taper slightly before hand so I think that helped last time. Tapering isn't an option this time. That was around 4 months ago. Was clean for about a month before being in a car wreck and getting a script. Started off fine but I'm sure you can guess how long that lasted. Now I'm here, probably more addicted than I was last time. I was taking anywhere from 10 to 20 vicodin 1000's a day. This time by the end of the day is I only took 10 I'd start to feel like shit. I knew at that point I was getting really bad on them. Now I'm out. No way of getting more, and honestly, I don't want more. I don't want to prolong the inevitable or switch to something more readily available. I want to quit. 

So, this time I told my doctor. Fuck it. I want off. I don't care if I'm black listed. Would probably be for the best honestly. I have back and knee pain but I'd rather deal with it than go through this anymore. This is worse than those 2. Anyway, he prescribed me Xanax .25 which I have 8 of so I'm trying to use them sparingly. I've also got clonidine which is I think .1mg or something and only like 14 of them so I need to be careful with those too. I have some ritalin Sr 20's which didn't work real well but may work for this. I also have 30 of the adderall xr 30s which seem to work best. I took one about an hour ago and feel loads better. I have add anyway if that bit of knowledge is needed. I also have a bunch of weed. I'm not a huge smoker but I figured that this would definitely be the time to smoke more than normal. I'm going to go get some medicine for diarrhea and hopefully whatever else you guys suggest. 

I'm sure I'm forgetting stuff. So I'll answer anything needed in the comments. I had to call off work today so I have to get a doctors note. Unfortunately that means going to the emergency room. I'm not sure what to say or do but it would be nice to have a few days off work. I work construction and it's not safe for me to work like this. Dying could be a result. Any tips on that? Should I just say I'm shitting too often and puking and such and hope they give me a few days off? Not having a doctors note is not an option. Thanks guys. I really hope this is my last time dealing with this shit and I can instead help others deal with it!

Edit: Also, for me, I think part of the worst thing with this is not being able? To do anything. I can reddit and shit but I can't seem to play video games or watch anime or TV or anything. Anyone else feel this way? I feel like if I could enjoy gaming or watching some shows I'd feel a lot better and this damn time would go by faster. 

I'm also dreading going to the hospital because I don't want to get up. Unfortunately I had to move back into my mom's about 6 months ago to help them with their bills and so they wouldn't lose the house. Honestly, that was part of the problem as my mom's roommate gets a shit Ton of vicodins and gives them to me. He uses one 750 a day and gets 120. So I got 90 a month I didn't have to buy.

Anyone experience these hit or miss effects? I've tried experimenting with having a full belly, an empty stomach, waiting 30 mins after I eat, eating high-fat meals, low-fat meals, taking tagamet (cimeditine), you name it.

Why?  Because you'll be put in the world of hurt known as precipitated withdrawal.  This painful condition of sweats/nausea/diarrhea/joint pain/ickiness can last a few hours, or it can last a few days. This, to my mind, is a huge drawback to subs.  After all, the whole point of Suboxone is to avoid discomfort.  Typically, I find I really can't seem to wait long enough.  I always go into some sort of PW.  Why?  Cuz I hate withdrawals in any form.  At the first sign of sickness, I want it to stop, usually because I have to go to work.  They say wait 24 hours, but for those of us with more long-term/heavy habits, that's not nearly long enough.  Fuck.  That.  Also, the addict in me needs to feel *something* every morning.  As a result, I take the sub too early, and precipitate my withdrawal.  So, how do you avoid this precipitated withdrawal, while also bypassing the waiting period?


Unfortunately, you'll have to ""waste"" some dope.  You see, the only cure for PW is taking more opiate.  The euphoric effects will be diminished by the Suboxone, as it works as an ""opiate blocker,"" but taking opiates will indeed pull you out of PW.  All the while, you'll be ""inducting."" 

So, what I'm telling you is to go ahead and take your sub (just a little, though, maybe 2mg to start) whenever you want, but make sure to have some dope to bring you back.  I'd say a half g of H, for example.  This will eliminate any discomfort from PW, and will allow you to bypass waiting 24+ hours of cold turkey.  I know this from my own experience, once the sub has taken hold in your system, and even though you've gone back to dope in the meantime, you are free to re-dose without the possibility of re-inducing PW.  


Maybe it's common sense, maybe not.  Anyway, that's how you avoid PW while also bypassing the 24+ hours of uncomfortable waiting.  Take em both at the same time.  I found that if you can help yourself through the first 24 hours of PW with opiates, you can smoothly transition into a Subs-only routine, feeling good all the while.",1415208643.0

Anyway, this has made it impossible for me to order say 5g or 10 of #4 via DNM's. Back when I was using daily I used to get 5 / 10g of #4 1g of #3 and 1g of #4 - great times but rapes the bank account. So after saving a while and paying over the odds for the BTC / £ exchange rate because Im doing a cash deposit and not a bank transfer via LocalBitCoins I had enough for a g. 1g from my favourite vendor, FrankMatthews over on Evo. Ive used him for years now, since the early SR1 days so usually get a little bit more weight than advertised. 1.1g of the finest #4 outside of SEA delivered to my desk at work - lol ;)

And daaayyymm. Just did a nice 0.05 shot and thought id pushed it too far - what an intense rush. A real toe curler :) The #3 and #4 ive been buying from UK vendors, a point or two at a time has been good, better than street quality but this is top draw. He claims around 85% H and 15% morphine.

Im coming off of like 20mg opana, or around 60mg roxy a day.  Im clean exactly 7 days now. The first 2-3 days were hell, but were much better after that. I had a good couple of days, and in the last 2 days ive had some horrible acute symptoms come back (skin crawling mainly), and i feel just about as bad as day one. What the fuck? My previous experience,with detox was always linear, and i never have had this rebound effect. Is this normal or common?

Anyway I've been helping him out and stuff so every time we kick it we get high to relieve the stress and ease the emotional struggle he's going through. He helped me do some labor work around the house today so I paid him by buying him a pack and today was my first time mixing vicodin 10s with a half bar of xanex whipped with some cherry NyQil (delicious) and then smoke a bowl after ( I'm not a smoker but I can't lie the weed hit the spot today.) anyway I've never whipped up twice in one day but today I just felt so good and when I came home fell asleep and woke up chilled with my girl just to come home later that night to whip up again. I hope my habit isn't getting too crazy. I do enjoy it quite a lot ; I'm also feeling really good tonight. I just wanted to get your opinions. How bad is it for me to sip on NyQuil while just feeling good. How bad is it for me to drink almost a whole bottle? sorry my writing sucks I'm nodding pretty hard right now haha,1415346519.0
2lk8eo,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2lk8eo/when_people_disappear/,27,https://redd.it/2lk8eo,for_tits_and_giggles,When people disappear,"I fucking hate it. And I don't just mean the standard not-texting-each-other-for-a-week-or-so until someone needs something or starts to get worried about the other person. I mean, we were in a middle of a conversation, and he just never replied. I mean, now when I call him, I get a message that his phone is unavailable, so either turned off or dead. His phone is *never* turned off or dead...not for a minute! And definitely not for days...no one's is, these days. 

This dude was important to me...he was the best friend I've had in awhile. He was also my only using buddy, my only dealer, and my protector and my ride for escorting. He was my way to make money and my way to get drugs. Luckily, I have money, and if I run out I can find other modes of transportation; they just won't be as convenient. I'm on my last part of my last piece of tar, though, and I have no easy, available dealer. I guess I'm lucky in that I'm probably not that addicted right now. 

As usual, though, I really just want to know what the hell is going on. I've combed through every arrest and every obituary in our area in the past week I could find. I don't know anyone else who knows him that I can get a hold of. I don't even know his last name...I know his real first name and his middle name, though, at least. And his age. 

Either something really bad happened, or he just suddenly stopped giving a shit about me. It has to be one of those 2, because my phone number is (unfortunately) posted on the internet! He watched me make the ad...so he knows where he can find my number. And if he's ok, I know he has some kind of phone, because his livelihood depends on it! 

I don't want him to be in trouble or hurt or dead, and I also don't want our friendship to suddenly not exist. For a multitude of reasons...

God damn it, we were having so much fun...shooting meth, going on 3 day long adventures together. Our thing might have been weird, but we were super real, and it was awesome. I've never had anything like what I had with him, and I haven't had anything even close to it in many months. 

Argh I'm already using past tense. Honestly, I'm at the point where I just want to know that he's ok. If he could just shoot me a text, that'd be awesome. It would suck if that was it, but it'd be better than this! And if he suddenly shot me a text AND showed back up in my life, I would just be happy he was back, and we could go right back to where we left off. No hard feelings and no questions asked. I'm just waiting for him to come back. 

I think I felt about 5 total seconds of anger at him haha, when I thought he was just ignoring me for over a week. I don't expect him to just quickly let me know whats up or just that he's alive out of how much he cares about me or out of ""friendship."" I do expect something, though, out of respect. We had a good time, we connected, and then we connected even more over how much we connected and had a good time. I never did anything to annoy him, piss him off, or betray him in any way...so I think I fucking deserve a quick text telling me its all over! If he was/is just ignoring me, that is...these feelings really only apply if the phone is on and functional. 

But, if he is fine right now and has a new phone or whatever, I think he should let me know he's alive, because he should respect the fact that I DO care about him, even if the sentiment is no longer returned. He should also respect the fact that he did everything in his power to convince me that he was trustworthy and reliable... for drugs, protection, whatever it may be. It's his fault I don't have a back up plan! or at least that I wasn't trying to find one this whole time. 

He was so convincing though...that I honestly refuse to believe he was lying until further evidence is presented. I can't believe that it wasn't all real. The only problem is...that means he's not just fine and being an inconsiderate dick.  

The last time something like this happened, my friend died alone, with a needle in his arm. ",1415346463.0

I have over a year clean and am not easily triggered BUT when situations like the one below occur, I can honestly say I get a fuck it I need to escape again feeling.

My 6 year old came home from school with head lice 2 weeks ago. I informed the school and they told me they don't inform parents anymore and it wasn't necessary to keep her out of school! Despite that, I kept her out and treated her hair, washed all bedding/clothes/pillows/stuffed toys and bagged all non stuffed toys up for cold shed storage for a month.

I share a bed with her, freaked out-- but didn't get it; however, the thought of it is a major cringe factor. Sent her to school, 3 days later she comes home with it again! Now I am pissed and the school still refuses to inform parents (clearly someone at school has it) they told me to tell her to put her coat in backpack and thats all the help they offer??? $200 later and 2 more hair treatments and washing of everything, I am fucking exhausted. I was forced to chop her hair.

My sister and her daughter live with me. Tonight WTF her daughter has it! Sis works at 3am so who gets to treat my nieces hair? THATS RIGHT I DO! So needless to say I just spent 5 hour process: lice shampoo, wash, comb, lice gel, comb, wash, blow dry, tea tree oil, comb, wash, blow dry and flat iron--with the added bonus of parting and pulling nits one at a time that are like super glue from each stand of hair cause the comb sucks ass! Also washing all my sisters bedding and clothes.

I am so fucking pissed and irritated. I just needed to vent this and I have grown rather fond of this sub. Seriously, I know I am not an active user but I find myself in this sub more than all other subs and enjoy your company and conversation.

Additional point, even after a year of sobriety it is times like this that fucking test me! Thank you I'm here all night...washing and rewashing..

I know this isn't the recovery page but this is good information I think people should know. If you don't want to hear about it don't watch.

So anyway back to really why I posted this.    

I have been on the stuff for awhile and its amazing the misinformation I see spread out in the world about it. So I wanted to share this video I just saw that really explains why replacement therapy is the best thing for some of us.

Now don't get me wrong Methadone has its drawbacks. And they are not really covered in the video so go do your research if you are thinking about trying it. But, if you have tried everything else and been doing this 10/15/20+ years, like myself. And you are starting to think this shit is gonna kill you sooner than later, you may want to give it a shot. It was the best decision I made in a long time. Going CT and complete abstinence was just not gonna work for me (tried it tons of times). So this was the right thing for me but I understand its not for everyone. I just think there is a lot of misinformation out there and It's a whole lot better than most people think.

I did my last little bit about an hour ago and plan on using this shitty weekend to test whether kratom can alivate some of the symptoms of withdrawal. 

I know that this baby binge, and upcoming shitty weekend, is not really comparable to some of your experiences but maybe what I learn might help someone through a even rougher time. 

I have about 30g of ""enhanced"" kratom that I plan on doseing about 10gs a day, along with some nyquill, lope and sweet cannabis to help me out at night.

Just had a an odd, short but detailed question. Does anyones vision get fucked up when high? I don't mean like stuff seems a little different, or your eyes get low and pinned pupils. 

 If the dose gets me ""high""(of ECP or BTH) to nodding, every time, regardless if IV'd smoked or snorted, it would kinda fuck up my vision. For example, i'd start looking out one eye automatically(usually my right eye open left closed), keeping the other closed automatically, somewhat subconciously until I noticed it. If I open both eyes(easy to do) stuff gets blurry. Reallll blurry, then my eyes get used to it. I can see clearly if I only have one eye open, but my vision is about a 3.0/10 at the start of opening, maxing out at a 6.5/10 after been open for a while. Seems like its mostly up close(to maybe 3 feet away) then the further away to a certain distance it gets better. Didn't happen when I used any other opiate.

Does this happen to anyone else? Does anyone know about this or anything similar? My vision goes back to 100% normal maybe 30-45 mins after the high is fully done(so maybe like 4-5 hours later after I dose?). It doesn't hurt or effect my vision after so i'm not TOO worried, but I still am wondering and curious. 

Any help is appreciated.

but then as I exit the stall I'm face to face with a cop waiting for the cubicle I was in, and another using the urinal directly opposite.

Almost shit in my pants I was so freaked.

All these voices assaulted me in my head at one point. They were so real...it was terrifying, because they grabbed my brain as they screamed and rocked it back and forth, making me rock back and forth in real life even. I tried to lie down to go to sleep after it finally ended, but there were somehow lights shining in the dark, and I felt like they're someone watching me. 

My back is all scratched up and I can't remember doing it. I remember being itchy the other night, but not scratching my back into bits. What the hell? Am I actually living the stereotype of meth that they show in PSAs?

I feel nothing, but then all of a sudden for a couple minutes or so I am overwhelmed by the urge to cry, like right now. If I had to try to talk to someone right now, I'd be sobbing. It happened earlier today with one of my professors...I had to run away and go hide in the bathroom to cry. I can't control anything.

I don't see an end. I know that's not rational or realistic at all, as I'll probably fall asleep in the next 10 hours and sleep it off, but right now I can't imagine this ever ending.

If you have any idea what is going on, please help.","Ok, so I just bought some tar from a guy who picked some up from HIS guy, who I've never purchased from before. What resulted is so far the weirdest experience with dope I've ever had.

The dude who picked it up for me said it was really good shit. He shoots, and he said that there was nothing left in the spoon after he cooked it, if I remember correctly. It did look beautiful; fat chunks of shiny black tar.

Now, the first weird thing that happened was that it ended up falling out of my pocket when I sat down on my couch after getting home, and I guess I ended up sitting on it. I had to go do a bunch of shit and I hadn't slept in well over a day, the usual shit I mention in every post, smoking meth, etc. so I was/am out of it. I totally forgot about the dope until many hours later, when I got home, settled in, and realized I had no idea where it was. I just assumed that I had thrown it onto my desk or something, but when I couldn't find it I started freaking out a little bit, because my memory has been collapsing, and I am so out of it I could have dropped it outside or something. 

I suddenly remember my 5 minute break on the couch and went out into the living room...and there it was, sitting right in the middle of the fucking couch haha. My roommates don't even smoke weed or drink (except on very rare occasions), so they wouldn't have even known what it was if they saw it...except that it was in a stereotypical little drug baggie and I mean, drugs look like drugs. I have no idea how they would have reacted to it or what would have happened if one of them had found it; I got lucky, because it must have been sitting there for at least 8 hours or so. 

So the few originally separate chunks it came in were now compressed into one patty. When I took it out, I realized it was rather soft and malleable. A pretty nice texture, actually. I weighed it, though, and it was 1.8 with the bag, 1.6 without. The guy swears up and down he watched his dude weigh it and the scale showed 2.0, both in the car, before I even asked him, and after I texted him. I don't know why, but I trust him. He has a job, and he somehow still has his life together despite shooting heroin quite a bit. I don't know much about him, to be honest, but he definitely doesn't look like a junkie; he doesn't seem like he needs to break off 0.4 of my bag. I already paid him generously for delivering my dope, which he didn't even ask for...he wasn't demanding or begging for money like someone who really needs cash for drugs. 

So now I'm trying to figure out, did compressing the dope somehow make it lighter? But shouldn't it actually be denser now? Heavier? I can't make sense of any of this. It looked like it was around 2 g before I smushed it, and I feel like I would notice 1.5 from 2.0. The only change was I removed air from inside it, right? 

**OK NOW FOR THE REAL PROBLEM I MADE THIS POST FOR:**

Honestly, that's not even the thing on my mind anymore, because a whole new slew of questions was opened when I tried to smoke it, because...I can't. I can't smoke it. I've had all types of weird and shitty dope, but I've never had dope that I couldn't smoke! The second the smoke hits my lungs, it burns like all hell, and for some reason my lungs are like ""nope!"" and I can't take another breath. I can't control it...I literally can't keep breathing in after the first 0.01 second.

I've been messing around with it, of course, and so far I managed to breath in for maybe 2 seconds with the tiniest piece of tar possible on the foil and my lighter as far away as possible from underneath it while still close enough to produce smoke. 

In the bag, it smells very strongly, and it smells like heroin. But it doesn't smell exactly like dope at all when it burns, and it doesn't taste like it either. I can't remember what I was thinking it tasted like. I can taste the heroin, it's just not how it usually tastes. 

Did I somehow get dope too pure to smoke? It looks like normal tar when it melts/burns/vaporizes/whatever happens, though I've obviously not gotten very far down a trail. What's on the foil is beautiful, actually, and it's driving me insane. I just keep thinking about how the guy made it sound like there was no cut. Is that even possible?

Most importantly, though, wtf can I do to make it smokeable? I bought 2 grams of this shit with the last of my money, and it's pretty frustrating, because it actually seems like good dope! Man I wish I could shoot myself up right about now >_<

Can I somehow add more of my own cut? Dilute it so I can stand to take at least some of the smoke into my lungs? 

I want to text the guy about it, figure out exactly what happens when he cooks his shot and if his dealer is selling to anyone who smokes. Maybe the guy knows someone else who bought it who doesn't just shoot...anything, God! But I can't text him anymore tonight, because he already told me to fuck off, he's out with friends. He didn't appreciate me questioning him about the weight, although I was honestly more questioning him if he'd ever seen anything like that happen before, with the compressed dope and all. He said he'd help me out in the future, and I made it worth his while to take 20 minutes out of his day and pick up dope for me, so I'm sure he could figure out that he could make more money off me in the future, than just this one chunk of dope not even worth $40. Imagining that it started as a 2g bag, I mean, and he broke off 0.4. You get it. Point is, I think he's on my side.

Right now, I am going to keep trying to smoke little bits at a time and see if I can't get high. If it's pure dope, I shouldn't have to take giant hits, right?

**TLDR**; I can't stand to take the smoke from lighting this tar into my lungs. The guy I got it from said it was super good and that it didn't leave any shit in his spoon when he cooked his shot. I sat on the dope and smushed it, and since I have no idea what's going on, I don't know if that could have something to do with it. My only theory is that it's somehow too pure to be smoked; if that is the case, is there anything I can do to dilute it?",1415423942.0

I think it appealed to me because it feels more like a vacation rental than a rehab, and they let you keep your phone, and Lindsay Lohan went there. Anyway, they were out of network on my insurance, so they required a cosigner in case I took the insurance reimbursement check and ran - since BCBS mails the check to the patient for out of network facilities.

Anyway, I was looking at two other places, and was pretty committed that if by first choice didn't work out, I was going to go to this other place down in Florida. But my top choice had this like treatment consultant from another company, and she ended up finding another facility that was not even related to choice number one - but honestly, it sounds better than choice two and I guess after spending hours on the phone with this lady I rent pretty committed to doing what she said.

Has anyone worked with one of these people before? It seems weird how it turned out, last time I just called the facility and went. I mean obviously she gets some kind of kick back, but she did a good job and the facility gets really good reviews.

Not really clean, of course - just junkie clean. I'm smoking weed as often as I can and drinking like the average American 23 year old (i.e., a fair fucking amount of drinking). Oh, and picked up my cigarette habit again, a pack every two or three days. I just started a new job this week and it's going really well so far. I don't get paid for another two weeks though.

So today I was thinking about using. Getting paid, cashing that check for a cool thousand bucks, and grabbing a gram of tar along with some foil and some synthetic urine in case my loving family decides to pop another drug test on me. I live under their roof, I know it's their rules, but you know how it is. Soon I'll have enough to move out and do whatever I want though. I've been really looking forward to it the past couple months. I only moved back home in July after living with friends during and after my college career (no degree but hey, with 9 credits left it's salvageable, right?). It's fucking insufferable. I love my family but goddamn, I've changed a lot in the past few years and things have been strained lately.

But today... today I was thinking about all that, about using again, moving out. That was my obsession for awhile, but now that I'm employed with a good gig - the best I've had yet, at a company I actually want to work for - I'm starting to feel differently. I've been happy this week. Hell, the past few weeks. I'm hanging out with my friends. I'm going to work sober and it's only until after work that I don't really know what to do with myself. I'm slowly earning some trust back with the family. I'm starting to see a light at the end of the tunnel - maybe I don't have to use, to get on that fucking rollercoaster ride that, if I am or were actually clinically depressed, only exacerbates it. I think I'm going to enjoy these next couple weeks, learning more about my job and hanging out with my friends after work and on the weekend to keep the good feels going. But in the back of my head, I'm worried that I'm just in-between habits, in some sort of weird Purgatory, where you ride the Pink Cloud only for it to disappear from under you.

Will I get given a prescription for the meds with instructions for when and how many to take etc to take home or will I have to go to the doctor's office every day to have it administered by a GP?

If it is the latter, how flexible are they? Do they let you set the time you can go in or is it whenever they have a slot and if you miss one you're fucked? Cos I'm a student with set lecture and seminar times I can't get around as well as a part time job.

Also, if it is a prescription do you pay for it like a normal prescription and do you just go to a boots or whatever to fill it, or do the doctors you're working with or the recovery center give you them directly?

Now this friend, as I came to learn, pretends that she is a druggy to seem ""edgy"" and ""cool"". However, I was unaware of this at the time and thought that she was just similar to me.

So I hit her up and she's like, yeah I got barzzz or whatever the kids call em nowadays. I'm like alright, the prices check out, and the description checks out (she described them as blue and oval shaped). I tell her I'll take X amount of said alprazolam but I won't buy it until she tells me what the imprint is. She seems to be avoiding this question but after persisting some she tells me they are 7176 | 93. I usually do the brand names or the RO39s. 

As I usually don't buy blue footballs, I believed this to be a brand that i just didn't recognize. Well I look it up and, guess what? It's fucking Zoloft.

I tell her that I don't want them and she spends the next hour trying to convince me that she's done ""real bars"" and that it's the ""same thing"". I tell her to fuck off and she eventually gives up.

Just a little anecdote as to how stupid some people can be with drugs. Oh yeah, and she sold them to my (old) friends so now they think that xanax feels like Zoloft.

Originally I was on 200mg/day, and throughout these two years it's been brought down to just 75mg/day (I even have to break the tablets in half since they don't come in smaller sizes than 50mg).

However, one thing I don't know is...how do I know if there's still underlying pain? If I quit and my legs start hurting again, I won't be sure if it's withdrawal symptoms or genuine pain that I still need the opiates for.

I've got a special day with a lady in the next few upcoming days and she is not opiate naive but not super experienced, although very experienced with benzos (alprazolam and clonazepam). I myself am moderately experienced with benzos and VERY experienced with opiates, although returning from a 5 month sobriety run. 

So I combined 4mg dilaudid (snorted, sorry guys) with .5 mg alprazolam yesterday and it was lovely (added 4mg more about an hour later with less effects). However, I feel as though heaven resides on 6-8mg dilaudid with .5 alprazolam. And w/o the benzos, I'll usually snort 8-10mg dilaudid at a time. it takes about 1mg klonopin to get me perfect :) So that's me.

She usually gets off at around 20-30 mg hydrocodone w/o any potentiation. She occasionally takes 1mg klonopin or 1-2mg xanax for her anxiety. I am unaware of her recreational dose for benzos as she doesn't really do that and neither do I (I have GAD, panic disorder, social anxiety, and bipolar) so my perceived recreational effect could simply be the reduction of my clinical anxiety which I misinterpret for recreation.

So that's us.

I want to take the vicodin and mix it with the alprazolam, so what dosages were you thinking of for each of us? I was thinking of 30mg hydrocodone + 1mg xanax for me and 10mg vicodin + .5mg xanax for her.

Now I want to have a lovely, warm, druggy-romantic evening with her which means that I don't want either of us to get too fucked up and I don't want either of us to black out.

What would you say my opiate loving friends? Thanks and nod on :)

It was his son, he was 34, and I consider him family. It's been hitting home for me considering I've Flopped a couple times now, twice alone. Once was serious enough to have the paramedics called, and my entire family found out. Apparently it was alcohol and meth. he lived in Phoenix and I'm sure there is plenty of smack around. I've thought it was heroin the entire time, but we won't know the autopsy results until next month. It's really got me questioning my iv use as well as my overall drug use. This has been the closest person to me that has died in my life. I've been to funerals, but I was younger or wasn't very close with the deceased. It's even harder when my family is calling and telling me they are happy it wasn't me, and that they just want to hear my voice. That shit hurts.

I know plenty of you have dealt with it, and some even on multiple occasions. I have no one to talk to, and all of my family is 700 miles away. We may have not been the closest family and we had our issues and differences, but I don't wish the pain of the death of a child on anyone. Even if he treated me like shit without cause my entire life. We never got along. Even when i was a child and didn't know any better i never got an ounce of respect. I will always hate that he was never a father figure to me, but I still want to be there for him. 
His son was like that weird cousin who would stay over on occasion. Always in trouble and bouncing around. He was the oldest of three, and has two kids left behind. His mother and grandmother are alive as well. When I was 14/15 bounty hunters came dressed as construction workers looking for him and tried to get into my house, but I was too young to realize what they were doing. I remember being completely confused, wondering why they kept asking to go inside. I realized later lol, I'll never forget that.

When you got nothing you got family, and when you don't have family and have nothing you question your reason to exist. I hope you can read this and realize what's truly important, and who's actually worth living. I've felt isolated from my family my entire life. I know that we all got closer when I got busted. It sucks it takes life changing events to realize what's important. I hope we can come together and stay together after this tragedy.

I am a pain patient and get 10mg oxycodone IRs for my prescription. My doc gave me the option of oxycodone vs. dilaudid, but there's a slight twist: He thinks 10mg oxy is equipotent to 2mg dilaudid (5x stronger) instead of 4mg (2.5x stronger). Everywhere I've researched tells me that orally, 10mg oxycodone = 4mg dilaudid, so I'm not sure where he's getting this conversion from. Is it possible he's just confusing dilaudid oral strength with dilaudid IV strength, which IS in fact 5x stronger than oxy per mg or something else? Or is he right that 2mg dilaudid = 10mg oxy (oral) and I'm missing something? I know this may seem like a dumb question but since all the research I've done conflicts with what my doc tells me, I wanted the community's insights (maybe there's a much wider variability in individual drug responses than I thought, so some studies show it is in fact 5x stronger, or something like that). Thanks in advance for any answers.

TLDR: All online research tells me dilaudid is 2.5x stronger than oxy (orally), but my doc tells m it's actually 5x stronger. Is he wrong or am I missing something?",1415482863.0

I always get very paranoid when I travel about running out of meds but this us potentially a place that I shouldn't have to worry about. Unfortunately Google is making me think that it is impossible to get pain meds at pharmacies down there while others make it seem trivial. Does anyone have any experience with this. I'm going to be going to a resort area but haven't picked one yet. I've had a recent negative health situation so my brother is taking me in the hopes that some warm weather helps me out a bit but I don't want to have wd down there.

I'm not asking for people to tell me where to buy drugs but more about what the situation is there regarding pharmacies and doctors and what a tourist has access to.,1415471808.0
2loo09,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2loo09/unconventional_ways_to_make_money/,64,https://redd.it/2loo09,8ballroadtrip,Unconventional ways to make money,"I have unconventional ways of making money. I was a really shitty stripper (I can't dance, I'm clumsy and awkward), but people liked talking to me and I primarily made money by talking to people.

On Monday I'm meeting up with this guy. This is the third guy that I've met that will pay me to hang out with him and do coke. I get paid $200-$300 to eat lunch and/or hang out at a bar and do coke with the guy. I used to do this quite a lot when my heroin habit was worse. I won't say it's nonsexual, but I will emphasize that there is no sex itself involved. I won't describe it as nonsexual because I feel like there's a lot of flirting and pretending like its a date involved. All three guys are married and seem to have boundaries, but more importantly, they understand my boundaries. I've admittedly turned tricks before, but I don't do that anymore. 

I would rather smoke foilies or crack than snort coke, but I don't want to freak the guy out by suggesting that. I also hate to do coke without dope, but I don't want to mention that either incase that's a big no-no to him. I'm trying to figure out what I'm going to do Monday because I only like coke occasionally, and I'd really rather have more dope with my dope.

Edit: typo

Edit 2: I responded to a comment with this, but I wanted to add it to my post

I've had this situation reversed before. Before I got addicted to opiates, I would always have coke, MDMA, alcohol and weed on deck. I always felt so lonely and would have little get togethers and provide a bunch of drugs. I really just wanted the company. I remember having a lot of money, but being so unbelievably depressed and lonely. I had even paid a friend to call in sick at work and spend the day with me getting drunk and going to Disneyland. I became a little more okay with being alone once I found opiates, but then I was broke.",1415465448.0

But I mean, these visuals, especially the CEVs are hyper-realistic, like it usually starts off with the standard noise/fractal patterns/etc. but then I picture myself in a completely different place and it usually involves just looking around at the scenery or watching people walk around. It's so strange.

As far as the OEVs go, I will get fractal patters that overlay whatever I'm looking at, usually very colorful. If I'm looking at my phone, it turns the phone screen into a sectioned/rotating/colorful box with little  boxes on it that are consisently moving. It kinda reminds me of old CRT monitors or old TVs in how, when you get really close to them, you can see the red/green/cyan that make up the colors.

I don't know how many people have found themselves addicted to meth as much as me...whiiiiich I think I just happened (I'm know how *shocked* you must all be at that news!), but you could still answer some questions I have. 

Note: I am smoking out of a standard meth pipe, and I'm now going to now write ""g"" instead of ""meth,"" because that's what I'm used to haha.

Quick background/excuse: I'm a young girl (contrary to everyone's immediate assumption, which I take as a compliment, actually!), and until recently, all of the g smoking I was doing was with guys with whom I was also doing h. Most of them would shoot me up and such, and also guide me through smoking g, you know, hold the lighter, tell me what to do. So I've done it enough that I *know* what to do for the most part, but I don't know *why* I do certain things. OK!

1. Why do I take the lighter away? Do you have to every time?

2. And how do you know when to bring it back underneath the bowl? Not being able to feel the inhalation makes it tricky. I've been watching the hole to make sure I can see some smoke swirling, but I'm always paranoid about keeping it going. 

3. It's technically vapor, though, right? Not smoke? We say ""smoking meth"" and ""smoking heroin,"" but in both cases, it's actually vaporizing, no? Since you're not directly lighting either on fire. Smoke/smoking are much easier terms to use, I suppose. Anyways...

4. When do you stop smoking the g in the bowl? When it starts turning tan? A darker tan/brown? When burning it produces no smoke?

5. If you're not supposed to smoke it until it literally disappears, than how do you know when to stop? The bowl is covered in blackness, I can't see shit. Right now, I've just been regularly dumping new shit in on top of whatever is still in there.

6. How often am I supposed to clean out the bowl? Like I said, I've been pretty lazy, just dumping new g in when I feel like it might be running low; when it starts taking longer and longer to get it going, and I feel like I'm not getting as big or as clean hits. I feel like I never see other people's bowls as completely covered as mine in whatever that black stuff is. It's even starting to go up my stem now, and it's almost reached the hole! It's not like I've been using it for months, or even a whole month...maybe 2 weeks? Almost 3? While I'm posting this monster list of questions, I might as well ask: 

7. What IS that black stuff, technically? 

Thank you all in advance! I love this sub so much, you guys are the absolute best. 

Quick update for anyone who replied to my Friday post about my weird heroin I couldn't smoke: 

It is heroin. The dude I bought it from hit me up today asking to buy some of it back! I sold some of it back to him, and he confirmed it was the same shit, he shot it up, and it got him high as hell. If I force myself to smoke as much as I can, just taking a bunch of tiny hits, I can feel that I get high and it is good, considering how high I get after smoking so little. Luckily, he agreed to buy from me instead of the original dude it came from until I run out. Until then, I'm thinking about trying to plug it. :P

Also, might as well add an update for anyone who replied so kindly to my other, freaking out, I've-been-doing-too-much-meth-post (I love you, thank you!):

I fell asleep soon after that, and literally slept for 24 hours. I think that's my record! I had that moment when I woke up where I checked the time, got psyched that it was only 7 because I had somewhere to be at 7:30 (pm)...and then suddenly realized when I checked again a few minutes later that it was 7 in the morning. I slept through my alarms, missed my thing, but I regained my sanity! So that's good.

UPDATE2: Just got done nodding with the pills, super chill still. I'm gonna throw in 1 mg dialudid and see how I feel. Then 1mg 30 minutes later if nothing happens.

FINAL UPDATE AND CONCLUSION TO EXPERIENCE: The combo was super awesome. I nodded for a couple hours and I can still feel a bit of the ativan going on. But super awesome body high with nods like I've never seen before. Going in and out of dreams. And what's nice is that the components required are all not-instant release so you can nod for hours and hours thanks to a little thing called potentiation. Really the only negative is that you're riding a tight rope between major euphoria and death. Near the end I tossed in some 1mg dilaudid (keep it light for safety) and they helped with first another nod and then a little boost so that I could talk to my sister and not seem super fucked up.

It really sucks to have two close friends pass away before they even turned 20, especially when you have known them since before you could form memories and knowing they both had so much ahead of them. Opiates are not my drug-of-choice and never have been but since my buddies passings it has been impossible to not relapse and stay sedated all day to try and mask my pain and emptiness. I have parents from one of my buddies blaming me for their sons passing and throwing his life away because I introduced him to drugs. I can't begin to imagine the pain they are still in and I can't help but agree with them, I'm a bad influence and a bad friend.

I plan on contacting a needle exchange and Naloxone program in the next week so that I can try and volunteer and offer any assistance they may need. These harm reduction facilities are very useful and important if you use, or even know someone who regularly use high doses of opiates/opiods.

My insides are heavy like lead. I'm so full of poop that urges to vomit overcome me. The foreseeable future is shitless, too, as I've been dosing methadone and oxy regularly. This morning I plopped out two rabbit turds after much straining. When I took a bath this morning I farted, bubbles rising from the water, condensed methane right in front of my face. It smelled like sewage. Inside my intestines a noxious brew ferments. Someday the floodgates will open and the portal to my exit ramp will unlock, letting lose turd after turd of stale biowaste. A vacuum--a feeling of emptiness will make me aware of how clogged my pipes really were. Sweet release mixed with slight worry over the bright red tinges of blood on the toilet paper. Just from the slight anal tearing. 


I made the mistake months ago to strike back against the opiate induced blockage by popping 4 laxatives. The following day I spent on the toilet, alternatively vomiting into the tub and shitting on the toilet. At 2pm I took my Fine Art Midterm while my stomach rotated like the innards of a grandfather clock, or a bread machine. Turning and turning in the widening gyre. The shitter cannot hear the shittoner. 


As I wait, the pleasing dopaminic release of the opiate cocktail plays counter to the halted nature of my bowels. Only when my brain has had its release can my body. But the order is set. First the receptors, than the intestines. For the poop waits. The poop always waits. Just like the addict does. That's the beauty of it. We're all dying, some faster than others. We don't know when. Or how. But someday, we die. And when that day comes, the poop does too. That's the day the poop waits for no one. But that day is not today.

And if it's just here in Notts, does your area have a similar equivalent (eg sometimes if I end up waiting way longer than expected while he reloads he'll throw in a freebie or the other day where I wanted 4 bags of dope but he only had 3 bags and 3 of crack and he needed to sell the lot together to be able to afford to go pick up, so I did and the next time I picked up off him he threw in 3 extra bags as a thank you).

(happened a few weeks ago),"This happened about 3 weeks ago and I've been confused about it since. Now the stuff I had been getting off my guy was rather weak so I usual take a large shot for my first dose. I picked up this time and the stuff looked different then what I'd been getting for a month, it was darker than usual but still came in one single rock like piece just as usual. The fact it was darker did catch my eye but I didn't think much of it, so I prep it up and take my hit. I got a big rush, a tingling in the back of my head and rushing in my ears. This is where I lose my memory. I get up to walk to the sink to clean my rig and the next thing I know I wake up on the kitchen floor, needle halfway across the floor and the sink running. Their was ringing in my ears and I was very confused. I don't know exactly how long I was out but it was at least 40 minutes because I was watching the decline of western civilization and when I took my hit FEARs scene was just starting and when I awoke the movie was over, FEAR's scene is the last scene and is the final 40 mins of the movie.
           So I'm wondering, was this an OD or did I just pass out. If it was an OD how the heck did I wake up, if I just passed out what could have caused it, if I've never passed out after a shot before, and I've been shooting up for about a year and a half now (BTH for the first year, powder for the rest and up till now)

**tl:dr** Took a big shot of a product that was darker than I usually get,  wake up on the kitchen floor sink running at least 40 minutes later with no memory, OD or passed out?

Day 3: 1mg Klonopin with .5mg xanax when out with friends (big mistake, got too messed up and I hated it)

Day 4: 2mg Lorazepam and later .25mg xanax with 20mg hydrocodone (loved this one, lots of nodding haha) and 1mg dilaudid snorted with another 1mg dilaudid snorted after about 30 minutes

Day 5: 1mg Klonopin with 10mg hydrocodone (I took this too be functional and to write some more, depressants help me write). Later they wore off (this is about 30 minutes ago) so I snorted 2mg dilaudid with .25mg of xanax

I've never touched drugs in my life. Not my thing, never was. But I've always had an interest in experiencing as much as I can....random things on all sides of sexuality, morality, culture, media....

And that's led me to want to try heroin, which (in my personal experience) is the drug that I hear talked about with the most fear and reverence, for its deadly addictiveness and its potency.

I am not really afraid of addiction. Trying something once is unlikely to have any real effect in that sense and I wouldn't do it again regardless of how enjoyable it was.

But, being a total fucking noob for drugs, I'm afraid of it, because I don't know ANYTHING about how it's done or prepared or used. And of course all my friends are goodie-two-shoes nerds who won't even touch a cigarette. So I don't know anyone who's into it.

I'll have to do some research, and find people who know what they're doing I guess, but does anyone have advice for someone looking to try something like this that's somewhat difficult to get into, given that right now, when I'm just starting to think about this, I know nothing about it beyond the fact that needles are involved and it's illegal?",1415662087.0

I don't know what it is, but I just don't think I am getting the rush, or either I am imagining it as something a lot stronger than it really is.

So the first successful IV administration I ever had was a few months ago when a buddy hit me. I didn't get a rush, but we both concluded it was because I had snorted a little bit of heroin when we first picked up a couple hours before IVing.

The next time was two days ago. I only had one of my normal sized snorting doses left (actually a little smaller than my normal dose), so I wanted to maximize effects by IV administration. I was able to register fine, which was my problem every other time I attempted to IV and failed, and got the shot in perfect without missing. The first thing I notice, before any effects hit me, is that an itchy red circle forms around the injection site. About 3-5 minutes afterwards, I notice the typical opioid warmth setting in  and building up, peaking around 10 minutes post-IV injection.

The last dope had no legs and was pure white fluffy stuff, so I suspected fentanyl, which would probably explain why It had no legs. So yesterday I was able to score a tiny amount of some MUUUCH better dope. It had long legs and also smelled pleasantly of vinegar!. Anyways, I decided to IV my last bit of it about 30 minutes ago and still didn't feel anything that I would classify as a ""rush"". Again, the opioid warmth took a few minutes (2-5) to set in and it wasn't really any more intense than it would have been had I snorted it instead.

I don't get it. I don't know what I am doing wrong. I have missed before, and I definitely didn't miss this time. So is the rush simply over-exaggerated? Everyone always talks about ""that rush"" so fondly, but it just doesn't seem like what I have been feeling is equal to how they describe it, haha. Maybe I simply didn't boot enough, but I definitely felt that euphoria and itchiness and everything I usually get from snorting it.",1415651530.0

But I cant seem to get a good solid answer on what dosage will start to see those effects. Iv seen some people say no more than 9mg of the stuff and thats even pushing it. Then iv seen people say no more than 20mg of the stuff. I have also herd that its prescribed in 10mg pills for ulcers up to 4 times a day in some cases which would mean 40mg a day should be fine.

BTW i have zero tollerance right now to opiates but plenty plenty experiencen to know what im doing with the hydrocodone. Just not the homatropine.  
  
With no tollerance, i should be able to get a good high from only 30mg-40mg of the hydrocodone. But in order to get that much, i would have to ingest between 9-12mg of the homatropine which is in the area im not sure about as far as side effects of the stuff.

I WILL be passing that drug test, as I will NOT be going back to jail or rehab :) just wanted to let you guys know, I feel GREAT I think the worst of the physical WD's are over.

From what I understand you get it when a piece of cotton fiber gets lodged in your heart. Also, I have heard you can cure it by doing another shot. This sounds dumb if you ask me, but then again I maybe the dumb one.

I have been IVing drugs now for about 10 years and never have gotten it. Or if I have I haven't realized it. Can you get it from any sort of filter such as the filter of a cigarette? I know this may sound stupid to most of you, but this is a genuine question. 

What are the symptoms? Can it be cured? How dangerous is it?

I have always used new cottons. When I am desperate and need to do a cotton shot, I cook the water first, toss in the cottons and mash them up, draw the water up, remove the cottons, put the water back in the spoon and use a new cotton to draw it up. So maybe thats why I have been lucky enough to have never gotten it? Or does it matter if the cottons are old or not? I imagine the risk is always there, but increases when using old mashed up cottons. 

Thanks in advance!

One of the spots used to be my old faithful ( sometimes didn't even have to tie off) but is now completely useless. it is rock hard with scar tissue and I actually haven't seen blood at all there in over a month. The other spot now though getting all the attention became increasingly difficult. it has a lot of scar tissue in it as well and After moving slightly up or down the spot became over an inch long and disgusting. Had a few problems with infection but I started taking better care cleaning it and it cleared up. Point is though it started giving me more and more trouble about two weeks ago and then stopped working completely. Now however at this one angle I've tried I'm getting blood trickling in but not hitting so I know I'm close which is even more frustrating. I feel like I've tried everything to fix this. Obsessive care for the spot, tons of new spikes constantly, tying off much tighter and closer to the injection site , swinging my arm before tying off to get the blood flowing (Idk if it actually works it's one of my s.o's  weird tricks) .

(a common dose is 7-12g, i used probably 70g)

I put 40 grams in a pan with water and lightly simmered it for about 20 minutes. I strained off the leaf and drank the water. I found it doesn't taste too bad with a little honey in. I also put 17g in a cup with cold water and just chugged it down. Added a bit more water to get the remaining powder and chased it with some tropical juice. I also got my grandmother to make me some little teabags out of muslin cloth with 10g each in them, so I also made a cup of tea using one of those. 

So in total I had 67g of kratom, pretty much 10 times a standard dose. All I got was a little dizzy. Withdrawals were still quite strong; had trouble lying still and could still feel my skin crawling and some chills.

Unconvinced that the powder was of good quality and that i was 'doing it wrong' i ordered 10grams of 15x extract which came divided into 500mg capsules. I have eaten 4 of them which equates to 30g of raw kratom.

I am itching quite a bit, and I do feel quite heavy headed and pretty nice, but I have also had some heroin and I had 10mg of methadone this morning, so I am unable to accurately pinpoint the effects of the kratom on my withdrawal. All I know is that I can defintiely feel *something*, but 2 grams of 15x kratom ? That's a hell of a dosage and I'm pretty sure I should be feeling something more than this. 

Is it because my tolerance is so high? Or is kratom just not what I'm expecting? I'm gonna have to wait till I'm sick tomorrow morning to see if they actually do anything for W/D.

Anybody got any experience with using kratom for WD?",1415726345.0

2.- I go to class to take the exam like usual. 5-10 minutes through the exam, I plan on getting up, going to the bathroom, and vomiting. I can pretty much make myself do it especially since I have opioids in me.

3.-   ......

4.- PROFIT???




But seriously, let me know if you all think this will work, or if you all have any better ideas. I wouldn't do this if it were not ABSOLUTELY necessary as I didn't do so well on my first exam. Plus if I end up win even a C in this class, then I will be kicked out of graduate school!!!

Took 8mg yesterday (about 24hr's after my last shot) and I got some crazy symptoms initially: loss of motor function, tingly hands, irritability. Felt fine after a few hours, and talked with my doc about it. He said it was probably some really light pwds from the bupe kicking the last bit of dope off my receptors. Wrote me a months script for 12mg/day. Took my second dose early today, and for some reason just have had pretty bad depression all day. I have been obsessing about heroin pretty much all day, and even though I feel fine with subs I'm still having bad cravings. I know I just need to give it a little bit of time. I guess what I'm depressed about is that, usually, when I wake up, I know exactly what I need to do at the start of the day and have no problem finding motivation to do it: get dope. But today when I woke up there was just a feeling of blankness. I don't have motivation to do much of anything. I have homework, a girlfriend (type thingy), but really just spent most of the day on this sub. I even drove down to where the Dman was, went up to talk to him, then just left? Just compulsive behaviors I suppose.

I guess I just wanted to vent a little bit. One thing I like about this sub is that I feel like a lot of us feel like we are on the outside looking in at other people's normal, sober lives. I see people playing basketball, video-games, school work, and they are happy and content. I remember just having things like that and enjoying my life. At the end of my dope use I honestly didn't even enjoy the high at all, it was just enough to make me feel functional again. But regardless it's gonna be a trip to rebuild a life surrounded with other things. I just need to have patience, exercise, study, hang with my gf, find hobbies, and things will be good again.

The reason I started doing dope in the first place was to drive my life in a fucking ditch so dying would be inevitable. I used to cook up shots that might kill me, I really didn't give a shit.

I'm sure it'll get better once the sub really starts working, but I was sober for 2 fucking years and I thought about offing myself everyday. I don't want comments like ""it'll get better"" and shit like that. I'd like to hear from other people in the same situation and how they cope. And maybe a success story, if that exist.

Tell me what you guys think.,"So I read an article recently about how like every animal has an average of a billion heartbeats in their lifetime before death.  Some have a very rapid heartbeat and due to it they die young while others have a much slower heartbeat and live much longer(think whales or the Galapagos turtles or whatever).  So I was thinking, maybe because we are artificially slowing down our heartbeat we are actually prolonging our life.  that's why someone can use heroin for years and look young as hell still while someone who uses meth for years looks old as hell(it does the opposite so they would be approaching death faster).

Granted there are health problems associated with use that would lower our life expectancy but say someone had access to unlimited amounts of pure heroin and decided to eat it all the time(I assume oral is the safest form of ingestion).  I know it's super ineffective but if you just ate a couple grams or something you would still get high as balls.  If someone did that would they be potentially prolonging their life? 

Obviously this isn't a good idea to do but I'm just curious and with the difference between meth and heroin users it seems like it could potentially have some truth to it.",1415840376.0

Made my purchase last week, and figuerd It would take about week what with the weekend and Veteran's day coming. Even without a tolerance and a safe assumption I wouldn't be seeing anything for a few days to come, I decided to look in the mailbox, and there she was. 

I pumped up a ilttle test shot, figuring I'd do a real shot once I knew how strong it was, but the test was all I needed. Barely enough to turn the water brown, and I am faaaaded ladies and gents.

For tolerance and my history, I've been chipping at opiates for 8-9 years.  For the first 2-3 years it was 5/500 vic's or oxy's in smaller quantities, low enough that I wouldn't poison myself from APAP.  I quit completely for a couple years (moved and had no connects), but then I met a girlfriend whose mom stockpiled 5/500 Vicodin and it was on like Donkey Kong.  It didn't take long for them to realize that my teeth and back weren't really hurting as bad as I made them out to be, but money talks, so that worked for a short time.  

After that I discovered you could buy Tramadol online, and I had a blast with it. I had about 6-9 months where I used Tramadol daily (about 14 pills or 700mg / day) but tolerance to the good effects came on quick, and it became a hassle (and expensive) to maintain a habit having to buy the stuff online.  Plus the danger of seizures was always in the back of my mind with too high a dose of the stuff.  But at the beginning it was a high like no other-- intense euphoria, ENERGY like no other (hanging up clothes on the line and cleaning the house was the best time EVER while I was on them-- never wanted to leave the house).

I still do them from time to time, but they don't have the hit that they used to.  I still take about 200-250mg at a time (lasts 4-5 hours or so), but I wonder if it's the SSRI properties or the actual semi-syn opiate that's making me feel good.  Before I built a tolerance, I'd rank 250mg Tramadol right up there with 60mg IR oxy, or an OP80 (at my current tolerance).  Now it'd be more like taking three 10's.

Anyone else feel this way about Tramadol?

I also was on poppy seed tea for a couple years daily until tolerance made drinking quarts of water a huge hassle and inconvenience.  Plus cross country trips to visit family on holidays were no fun having to lug 100 pounds of poppy seeds with me.  Boy the legal opiates were sure nice while they lasted.  Costs $150 / 50lb. of seeds now online, too expensive for my taste.

Now I just chip at oxy's a couple times a week. Couple IR30's or an OP80 usually has me feeling groovy for a couple/few hours.",1415818820.0

I want to say first of all that I wish everyone of you were here with me (in your individual ways, that is-you must know what I mean). Too often all people do is complain. And we have a reason to. Life is truly rough. But if you ever take the time to REALLY appreciate something it actually FEELS good. So for the next 3-5 hours ;) I am going to forget about the problems in my life that CONSUME me and appreciate everything. Here's where I'm at...

My company has had me working in *a large metropolitan area* lately-really long, brutal hours. They are willing to pay for me to stay up here, but generally I REALLY like my own bed.
This morning I knew it was going to be a particularly long day-so I decided I was going to stay the night. I started looking up cheap motels and then said fuck it. I figure I work hard for this company, they can offer me a night of luxury. So, I booked a room at one of those beautiful old historic hotels. I walked in to my room and was BLOWN away. I have a 20+ floor room overlooking the city and the water. 
The best part is yet to come...I phoned an old friend from the area to see if they had any gear-""just roxes-but I'll hook you up"" (she did!). It was going to be a trip down memory lane! 
So, she dropped 7 x 30's off to me about an hour ago. I now sit freshly showered, hair combed, in my terry-cloth robe and slippers....FLYING (all 7-why not?). I have my laptop, a sandwich, and some Simply Lemonade and don't need ANYTHING else. Everything is simply at peace right now and its incredible.
I suppose hard to find a ""moral"" in this story considering my state of solace is drug-induced lol. But I can say this-it just feels GOOD to appreciate rather than complain, no matter what the circumstances. 
Sorry for the length of the post. I just really felt like sharing. I hope everyone is doing alright. It would be awesome if you wanted to share a similar story of what your're up to!

So I come to you with a question, or a statement, or maybe just a general idea. I'd like to hear what anybody thinks about the validity of the idea of getting clean from opiates (and all hard drugs really, because lets face it they only exist to mix with opiates!), but still choosing to smoke weed, drink, maybe use psychedelics, generally other drugs that lend themselves more to recreation than to abuse.

I know it's possible, with many notable examples, but how common is it? Is it sustainable, or just lead back to opiates? How functional are the people you know who maintain this lifestyle? And what do you think the benefits, if any, are there to choose to use recreationaly versus a sober life?

I know there are many answers and opinions and not any one is right or wrong, I'm just looking to gauge what the community thinks on the idea. Thanks!",1415938621.0

I've been given it lots of times with lots of refills, I'm assuming it's not uncommon among women to get this. It's for bladder pain, stops spasms or something.

I've been taking it lately because as a side effect it makes me sleepy, and I'm in an unfortunately broke/sick situation right now. Insomnia is the worst so I'll eat any drug around if it makes me sleepy.

Anyway, I've noticed a crazy effect. I'm in withdrawal for sure, I have every symptom -except- for the sweating. The cold sweats are goddamn UNBEARABLE, I'm sure lots of you will agree.

So I looked up this med, and it turns out it's used to control excessive sweating as an off label use. It feels pretty miraculous not to be drenched right now.  I'm wrapped up in bed with a heating pad and all, so happy not to be throwing off my covers constantly.

Anyway, if anyone else has this med laying around, give it a shot next time you're sick. I'm curious to see if it would help anyone else.

I pretty much gave everything up to this guy because I was so in love with him and wanted to be with him no matter what. We were living underneath a bridge in Seattle at the time, and strung out on dope really badly. My parents wanted me to come back home and get clean and I told them that I wouldn't even consider it unless he could come back with me. They had never met him before, and knew that he was pretty much the only reason I was a homeless junkie, but they agreed that he could come back east and move in with them. 

So we moved in with them and a year later, he was dead from an overdose. The only time I met his family was at the funeral. They live in California, and we met in Seattle and then moved to Vermont, so we never had a chance to visit them. When I went out for the funeral, they were really great and didn't blame me in the slightest, which I was thankful for. 

Anyway. He died in 2003 and I haven't had any contact with his family since then. I just found some pictures though, and I want his family to have them. I found his little sister on Facebook and sent her a message. 

I still really love this guy. He was fucking perfect and I just feel really weird because there aren't too many people that I know who knew him... There are some people still in Seattle where we met, but I'm really only facebook friends with a few of them. There were a few people here in Vermont who knew and loved him, but I really feel like he only existed for me. I don't think that too many other people have strong memories of him and on one hand I would LOVE to hear from his family because they are a part of him, and on the other hand I am really scared that no one remembers him. That I'm the only person who ever really knew him. 

Just venting. I sent his sister a message and a friend request. We'll see if she responds. I wouldn't blame her if she didn't want anything to do with me since I'm pretty much the reason why he's dead. I couldn't save him and I handed him the shot that killed him.

1/4 of the 80mg pill has been dissolving in a shot of coke for about 8-9 hours now. No Benadryl taken this time, hopefully nausea isn't an issue. Not nearly as tired this time either.

1:14AM: Shot down the hatch.

1:21AM: Mild light-headedness, slight discomfort in stomach. I wouldn't call it nausea though.

1:30AM: Becoming very light-headed when I move my head. Still mild when it's still. Feeling pretty good, might be the start of the euphoria, but I can't tell. Not sure if I should be feeling more by now.

1:34AM: Very slight wave of nausea, gone almost instantly. Since then the light-headedness has increased and a soft, tingling sensation has started in my arms, torso and legs.

1:42AM: Still feeling pretty good, but the tingling stopped a few minutes after it started. Just listening to some music and browsing reddit. Pretty bored, any one got some suggestions of things to do?

1:50AM: Slightly more nausea, no other changes. Still bored.

2:01AM: Become more nauseas when moving, but not serious. Arms becoming very warm.

2:09AM: Eyes suddenly very heavy. Not tired, it just feels good having them closed.

2:12AM: Had a feint image of a green corridor with a green ball spinning on the roof. Only lasted a few seconds, not sure if I'd call it a hallucination.

2:22AM: Eyes still quite heavy, but I haven't ""seen"" anything again. Getting quite warm, almost hot. Have to focus on what I'm looking at or it can become a bit blurry. Still a bit nauseas, no more than at 1:50AM though.

2:31AM: Two more images, one was me sitting in bed holding a coffee in my right hand, a cigarette in my left and a newspaper in my lap. Second was a cyberpunk shark flying through a futuristic city.

2:40AM: A badly burnt/decayed corpse, wearing nothing but a very clean, fresh pair of white pants. It was in a bright yellow room with a green door.

2:50AM: Really craving something sweet, like marshmallows. Almost no nausea now, little light-headedness. Still warm, but no tingling sensations.

3:02AM: Standing in my street, lots of white birds flying above. The sky is a solid yellow, and there's a big, entirely green tree behind one of the houses.

3:19AM: Feeling pretty normal now. A little-light headed, but my eyes aren't very heavy and I haven't had any more day-dream like images when they've been closed.

3:46AM: Almost entirely normal again. Not light-headed, nauseas, warm or tired. It would seem as though I'm done.

I've lurked around here for a long long time and there is a lot of really good information here. Also a lot of really knowledgeable and friendly people. :) I'm hoping you guys might be able to give me some advice about something I've been really struggling with for a while.

**TL;DR: I've blown out all the veins in the good, obvious places (hands, arms, feet, neck). Can anyone help me figure out how I can better search for and find veins in other places, and can anyone else relate to what I'm going through?**

I've been shooting H for about five years now. I never really shot anything else seriously. When I first started doing H and I couldn't / just didn't get it all the time, I would sometimes shoot Dilaudid instead. And last year, there was a brief couple month period where I shot about as much coke as I did H.

But my problem is now, and always has been, my veins. I wanna include some pictures of my hands (taken about a month ago) so that you get the idea:
[The right one](http://imgur.com/lqysQ6a)
[The left one](http://imgur.com/Z6f5VAu)
Like I said, that was about a month ago, so at any rate, the infections have healed and closed. But I think it's pretty clear that I've **really** ridden my veins hard and damaged a lot of them. My arms have a lot of serious scars and scar tissue (although not quite as serious as my arms...) also. My feet and neck are all used up too, but they aren't scarred / were never infected like any of the spots on my hands.

I think there are probably a couple reasons mine got scarred so bad. They really only got seriously bad like **that** last year, when I went through a two month binge of shooting coke and H with my boyfriend. We had received $35,000 in *cash* and we were doing *so much* heroin that there was **too much** heroin, for a while. So in addition to riding my veins really hard with heroin during that time period, I also started shooting coke. That's when I got a lot of the original infections that left those scars they have now, at any rate. Pretty much all of the badly scarred areas in those pictures were of course abscesses at one point, that ended up either needing to be cut open or came open on their own and oozed out puss and drained and all that fun nasty stuff. :( For a better idea of how much H and coke we did during that time period, we probably spent ten, *maybe* fifteen grand on legitimate stuff: we had the foresight to pay a year of rent in our current townhouse, and about six months ahead on utility bills, and to pay off some debt. And the rest of that money? We blew through it in **two months**. We might as well could have just set that money on fire and watched it go up in smoke, for how quickly it did.

So I think they scarred so bad and blew out and stuff a lot during that time period just because of how heavy my use was and also the addition of coke, since I know stimulants are harder on your veins. But even besides that time period, I have **always** been a heavy user since beginning my habit. It's a low day for me, even now, to spend under $50 a day to split between my boyfriend and I, and I will drop up to four or five hundred in a day if I have it / can get it.

I think another thing I have a unique issue with is that I have a coagulation disorder called a Factor Five Leiden deficiency. I actually had a blood clot when I was eighteen, they think that my underlying condition plus birth control created a DVT in the veins in my head (not anuerysm, not in my brain). When they draw my blood at the hospital or at the lab, if they don't test it *right away*, a lot of times it'll clot before they can, and they have to draw it again. And I haven't had anyone tell me this, but I have always suspected that my blood clotting more quickly than normal people's has something to do with why my veins blow out so easily / aren't a lot of times good for subsequent use. Because my technique in the beginning was less than stellar, but surely anyone would be at least **modestly** competent at hitting after *five years* of it.

Anyway, that's some background about how I fucked up the veins I have been able to find. Like I said, my technique is very careful, and when I can find a good, big enough one (like the one in my neck) it can go for a while, but usually by 20 or so hits, it's blown out. I got lucky with the one in my neck recently (when I first learned how to shoot it), and managed to hit it multiple times a day for several weeks before it blew out, but that was just very unusual for my body.

The last few days and especially tonight (when I've had money...) have been incredibly frustrating because of my current lack of veins. I had taken a ten day break (ten days in a row is a long time for me, to get it outside of rehab or jail) and I had had a small burst of luck immediately following that and got lucky on every hit for about a week. But yesterday, the day before, tonight, I couldn't hit *anything*.

So I guess what I am wondering is this: pretty much I have burned up the veins on my hands, lower arms, upper arms, feet, and neck. I have hit superficially in my chest area before and blown out a lot of those tiny superficial ones and can't really see / hit them anymore. Does anyone have any good advice when looking for veins in other areas besides the ones I've blown? 

Is there a good way to concentrate on your legs? I just can't seem to *see* any veins when I look for them in my legs? I usually try tying off about midway up my lower leg and then walking around a bit to get blood flowing to that area, but I still can't really see, and have no idea how to target the upper area. It seems like those veins would be pretty deep? And my legs are an area I would really *love* to be better at searching through, because like I said, they are currently almost untouched.

Does anyone have a favorite vein that **isn't** on their arms / in one of the other blown out places I have?

Is there something I can do to try to improve my technique? I **try** to follow the directions in the manual. I use 29 gauge half-inch 1cc needles. I use new ones as often as I am able (I used to be able to needle exchange really easy, but the needle exchange policy changed around here - that's a rant for another time though). I pop my tourniquet off after registering and before pushing down the plunger, so there's not too much pressure built up. I go slow and try to be patient.

I don't have an exchange program that I know of that's within a reasonable distance and probably need something more discreet than the county health dept. since I know people that work there, including my mother in law.

I've always broken the points off to reduce the risk of anyone being stuck should they come across any before tossing them. One thing I've done is put them in an aluminum soda can then crushed the can so that they are well contained before trashing them. These days though, I'm getting boxes of 100 and I'm not reusing needles at all and I'm also shooting up more frequently so I end up with quite a few. Right now I have a laundry detergent container made of fairly heavy plastic that's full of them. I thought about super gluing the lid on that and tossing it in the trash. Is there a better option y'all know of? I don't know if I would feel discreet enough (prolly not) taking them to a pharmacy but do pharmacies dispose of them?

I'm 4 days in treatment with Suboxone. The first 3 days were kinda sucky, but now I feel just like I would when I'm not sick but not high either. And honestly it's fucking amazing. I can drink with friends (first time 2night), sleep over at others without worrying about waking up dead sick, and all the other misery that comes with a dope habit. Honestly, I'm fucking tired of the daily ""hustle"". Put it in quotetion marks cuz my 15k inheritence supported some of my habit the last year, along with a minimal wage salary, but I didn't want to spend ALL the money my grandfather left me on dope. It was supposed to spent on an apartment, eduction or other constructive things. But instead 90% of it funded pumping $15.000 dollars of 'filth' into my veins.


I went out to bars for the first time today since I started shooting heroin (1 year ago), and it went pretty good. I spent about as much as I would've on heroin on 1,5 days. That includes beers before going downtown, drinks at the bar with friends, actually making NEW friends, cocaine and taxi. But I don't regret it a bit. These are MEMORIES. Nodding aren't memories. Nodding is sleeping while being slightly awake. The high *is* amazing, but it leaves you nothing but withdrawals and regrets. 

I just want to make sure that I'm not putting down any users with this post. I certainly know how beautiful it is to do a morning shot, and how great heroin or other opiates are at (temporarily) curing physical and mental pain. I just want you to know that there probably is a way out, if you truly want to. Either subs, methadone, or going full clean. There is a better life out there for you. Watch Shawshank Redemption or some shit to get some inspiration, and put an an end to your extremely unhealthy lifestyle. It won't be easy, but it's worth it when you can afford to have fun instead of spending all your money on just being not-sick. How pathetic ain't that? No matter how much money you make, your tolerance will sooner or later catch up with your income. 

Heroin is fucking awesome. But let's face it, the vast majority of you have a much higher potential than being a dope fiend. ",1416027284.0

That wasn't the case though - my first dose of the new oxycodone 10mg IR pills was 4 pills, and it was about what I used to get from 2 percocet.

I'm finally ready to leave it all behind after trying methadone, losing my car, leaving school, and ruining my relationships with many people. These are a few thoughts i've had over the past few days.

1.) Everyone has to pay the piper. The people who started out having the most self control and non-addictive personalities - became addicted. The longer you use, it seems, the heavier that ball and chain attatched to your ankle with you becomes. You carry this for the rest of your life. 

2.) There is no logic in heroin. All rational thoughts go out the window and the things you thought you would not do - start to happen with frequency. 

3.) You become akin to the person you used to despise. Remember back in the day you'd laugh whenever you passed by that strung out college kid in harris teeter, at the coinstar, emptying a suitcase full of pennies? Or how you were repulsed by the 30 year old guy who hung out with college kids, sold them pills, and had sex with the dumb girls? Somehow heroin brings you very close to these characters you used to not associate with. 

4.) Dealers don't care about you. They just don't. You're sick and don't get paid for 3 days? I'll see you in 3 days, bud. 

5.) Suboxone and methadone just kept me around heroin. With suboxone I was never really clean and every methadone clinic is a huge joke of how high you can get with your dose and xanax/drinking. I wish when I tried to quit in the past, that I never used these substitutions. I was too afraid of the withdrawals to ever do it cold turkey but with subs/methadone I never TRULY left opiates, until now. 

6.) Nobody is happy. At a certain point of addiction the only happy part is having a syringe full of amber liquid and a few hours after injecting it. Every other moment is hell. Heroin really does take something away from you.  

7.) Meth is stupid. I only did it once but even at my worst I still looked down on tweakers. That is just a dumb drug and I hope you guys don't get strung out on it. It's not a good look. 

8.) If I leave now, I leave relatively unscathed. I have fucked up a lot in my life but I can only stand to fuck up even more if I don't make this choice. 

I just felt I should write this out. This isn't a goodbye from r/opiates i will read this page for years to come. It's mostly just putting down into words what i've been not able to verbally tell anyone. It's cathartic in a way. I'm off to an NA meeting. Good luck my people.",1416011234.0

Hope everyone is good.,"I posted probably about 7 or so months ago talking about how I was going going to treatment and wanting to get my shit together. I was really struggling, yes my life was ok on the surface but spending hundreds and hundreds of dollars on a fleeting feeling is not, or was not, sustainable for me.

I went to treatment, used once while there, got kicked out but decided to stick with. If anyone is trying to get clean that's my only advice is stick with it. A lapse doesn't have to be a full blown relapse.

Add chemicals to your body everyday for years and years and it gets adjusted to them. Needs them, even. It's a long process of getting normalized without them.

I look at the pro's vs the con's of using and it doesn't sound attractive anymore. I know the feeling, I know the taste in my mouth, the desire for more. More more more. That's how it goes for me anyways.

I'm pretty much chilling in the present moment. Feel a lot stronger and healthier then before. Lifes good. No paranoia (although I do feel like i'm doing something wrong sometimes). No overdrawn bank accounts (was about 2 grand in debt when I quit though, even with work). I am starting to make back what I lost.

I've been spending my time mostly posting on /r/opiatesrecovery a lot of really good people there. We are all going through this together. It helps to have people there for when, and if, you slip. For some reason it's easier for me to connect with people I hardly know then those around me. It's always kinda been that way.

So yea, it's possible to stop. I had a really severe habit to multiple substances. Daily use. Got sick. All that. It's doable. If anyone was wondering I guess. 

I just hope that everyone who wants it or needs it because they are not happy with the way life is going can get help. Before they die, or go to prison or whatever. Just don't die for christ sakes. It can and does happen everyday. If you die there is no second life.

I am a teacher. I am a role model. People view me as friendly. People view me as outgoing.

I am socially anxious. I get anxiety attacks. I worry about whether or not my dealer will fall through. I spend most moments worried about money, worried that I will not be able to get the money that will allow me to be in this state of warmth, this state of achievement.

I am well spoken. I am intelligent. I am bound to improve myself. I am predicted to live wealthy and comfortable.

I am broke. I spend every last dime on pills. I can't cope when I'm not high. I can't deal with the struggles that life throws at me.

I am stable. Despite falling through occasionally, I am an inspiration to mental health everywhere.

I am extremely unstable. My money either goes to drugs or it goes to nothing. My mood changes daily and I need to take non prescribed medication in order to maintain a facade of normalcy.

I am a camp counselor. I am a teacher. My kids love me and I love them.

I am drug addict. I exist in the bowels of society. I snort drugs, pop pills, and take shots of alcohol in order to get my work done. People believe me to be sober and ""in a good mood"" when I am on benzos, opiates, and alcohol.

I am in control. They never see me drink. They never see me intoxicated. They don't test me as there is no reason why. I am an upstanding citizen and I have never broken a law.

I trade drugs to get drugs. I break the law every time I cut the powder and bend over with a straw to inhale.

I am charming. Women love me.

I hate myself. I am anxious. I try to avoid love because it hurts.

I want to live life. Life is beautiful and wonderful. I make people feel good. I am a good person

I want to fucking hang myself and see it all drift away. I want to take so many drugs that I die one night. I want to see my life end. I am a bad person. I hate myself.

I am bipolar and I am drug addict. I face difficulties every day and even though I want to be ""clean"" and ""sober"", without drugs, life is simply unlivable. I would rather choose to pop and snort pills than to hang myself. I would rather be the man that everyone aspires to be rather than the one who hangs himself one night.

I don't want to be an addict. But I am.",1416121548.0

It has been discussed many times before, but I'm curious of everyone's opinion of sex while on opiates. I have a feeling most answers will be male, but if you're a female I encourage you to reply-really curious to hear that side of it.
I used to think sex on opiates was great. I could get hard no problem, but at the same time last and LAST. My girlfriend loved my new-found stamina. 
Lately, however, it has become a problem. I can still get hard and last and LAST...but that's the problem. I can last...indefinitely. Its at the point where my girlfriend and I go for an hour plus....I could go for god knows how much longer than that, but after an hour she's about to pass out.
She has long-since arrived (maybe multiple times) and been satisfied beyond her expectations by the time we cut it off. 
But I haven't. Not at all. Like I said, getting hard isn't a problem. Of course sex is pleasurable, but not like it used to be. Its like I'm just going through the motions. Honestly the modus operandi for when my gf and I do it now is pleasing her 100%-its not like she doesn't try to please me-I just tell her lets do what she wants. Why? This way I have something to focus on-otherwise I might as well be watching TV, the extent to which my brain is there having sex.
Its always like this. Why even go for an hour? I always think I'll be able to ""arrive"" if we go just a little longer, but of course it never happens. I'm embarrassed to say how long its been since that actually happened. Obviously this isn't healthy. I need (and WANT! its been way too long!) to have regular sex with my girlfriend. Maybe this biggest issue, though, is that its creating a rift between the two of us. She thinks its her, like she doesn't do it for me anymore or something-which breaks my heart.  She has no idea that I'm off the suboxone and back on [real] opiates (w/subs there were very limited sexual side effects). 

Thats how I feel about sex and opiates at this point. I've kind of changed my view from ""its awesome, I'm Superman!"" to ""let me just *** already!). If you have any advice for me, that'd be great. But like I said, I'm more curious to hear people's opinions.

I was first diagnosed when I was 10 but after three years of chemo I was healthy for a few years. Anyway I remember that painkillers made me feel good, so when I relapsed it was fucking game on. I wasn't in pain, but I wasn't going to miss the opportunity. I then managed to lie about the severity of my pain and get Fentanyl patches. I was on two 100s at one point. One day I thought ""I bet I'd get higher if I sucked them."" I woke up an hour later. I only realised years later how fucking lucky I was that my tolerance was so high. I was going through a 100 patch a day. I became super, super disabled around this time and couldn't move without being pushed in a wheelchair. My Mum and nurses knew I had a problem so they started putting the patches on my back so I couldn't reach them to take them off and suck them. That didn't stop me. I didn't care who you were, if my Mum wasn't around you were getting asked to take this patch off my back. It reached a stage where she'd write ""Don't remove the patch on his back,"" on the patch AND on a sign stuck to my bedroom door. She forced me to taper. I had no choice, she had them and I couldn't get to them. With enough persistence I got those patches off. Either struggling for hours with my helping hand grabber or by convincing my friends to. So the tapering thing didn't work as I was still getting that instant hit despite the patch sizes decreasing. Anyway it reached a point where she said ""That's it. You're done."" And that was the two worst weeks of my life. Now I've had cancer three times, months of chemo, radiotherapy, surgery, comas, over one hundred general anaesthetics, a bone marrow transplant, septic shock, cerebral haemorrhage, the fucking works. Those first two weeks off fentanyl going cold turkey from a monstrous habit is the worst I have ever felt in my entire life. It reached a point where I threw myself on the floor in a pathetic attempt to back shimmy my way into the room that had the fentanyl, then find some way to open the cupboard from the floor, and then reach in and grab them, i.e impossible and insane. I got through it, partly because I started smoking a half ounce of weed a week. Thankfully I fractured my spine and was put on DHC Continus four years ago, and I'm still on that now.

Do you regret ever doing them? Sharing a bit of my experience,"Hi /r/opiates, just wanted to ask a sorta personal question of why you choose to do opiates. For me, my reason wasn't first trying painkillers after surgery and moving up the ladder of hydro-->oxy-->etc... it was just that I became very depressed and although the idea of dope scared me at first, I fell into this pit of where I didn't give a shit and thought I could control heroin. How fucking stupid does that sound. I eventually stopped caring even more and started using a lot not caring.

I also use out of sheer boredom which was my recent relapse (was clean for 1.5 yrs thanks to suboxone). Everything was starting to look bright again and I was hopeful for the future for once. Was dope-free and starting to really live again. My depression went away a bit, and my cravings were very infrequent in comparison. Somehow stupid me thought it would be a good idea to go back to that nostalgic heroin high.

Athough I am not exactly a heavy user at all. I already finished a couple bundles in 3-4 weeks in the relapse. I even did coke a few times along with the dope... I then got on suboxone and surprisingly my physical withdrawals were basically nonexistent, in fact I felt great when I went on the suboxone. 

This was kind of awesome. Somehow, I obtained a whole new attitude that I was going to kick life's ass. I had all these thoughts of ""yeah dope will destroy me"", ""I am losing progress in my life"", and thinking stuff like I'm going to stay clean and make something of myself instead of escaping my reality and procrastinating the most important aspects of my life. I do notice that when I am not using opiates, that my emotions are back in full effect. On heroin, I feel much more dull emotion-wise.... so I guess the big shift in feeling more alive again when sober may have contributed to my positive feelings.

I just relapsed AGAIN tho yesterday after 5 days of being dope-free on sub.... although I was on subs were helping tremendously and my phys w/d wasn't there, the mental craving came back on day 3-4... and it was very strong.... that on day 5 after I took a bigger dose of my suboxone dose than my usual, I only waited 9 hours and got some dope again...  and now I'm high right now :/... I'm feeling great... but I am going to school next Fall and don't want to have the burden of a heroin addiction with me while I'm there to study. 

One thing I'll say, is that I always hear people saying that if you want to get clean, you have to do it cause you want to. You have to do it for YOURSELF and nobody else. I completely agree with this statement, and think it has a lot of value in getting clean, however, although I have so much tremendous support by my best friend, girlfriend, and family, who think I can do so many great things in my life if I set my mind to it, I don't know love myself. I hate myself tbh. Even though I'm not a sketchy opiate thief, I think I am an asshole who is selfish. 

I know that this sort of pathetic self-loathing solves nothing at all but the self-hatred seems to be extremely more pronounced when I am using heroin/relapsed on heroin... even when I was 5 days clean I felt like I lost my motivation and drive to live life strong again. The physical withdrawal I can deal with cause of the sub, but the mental progress I made seems to have been crushed a bit :/ hopefully I pull myself out of this and start trying to put more effort on being the person I want to be..


I don't regret trying opiates, I don't regret trying heroin... because I feel like if I could restart my life again and start fresh I'd still make the same mistakes due to partly my drug curiosity and it wouldn't matter. ",1416094962.0

I'm usually a chipper but I've been slipping up a lot lately and I had a pretty messy last couple of weeks in terms of drugs. I knew WD was coming, so I picked a good weekend to get the worst of it out of the way.

I'm probably not going through WD to the level that a lot of you guys do, but damn, it sucks. It's fascinating how much this feeling sucks. Last night when I was trying to sleep I kept having horrible pain in one knee...and then the other. My knees, of all places? Then my back. I woke up halfway through the night, going in and out of sleep, panicking about a window that I was convinced I left open when I was sleepwalking. It was closed when I woke up. I eventually had a lot of vivid nightmares about me being on this TV show and failing miserably at everything and being mortified. Apparently I wasn't really the contestant I was performing as, but I somehow ""possessed"" her or was her for the night. The ""real her"" was very talented and I was making her look awful by being inside her body and brain. I woke up very suddenly, and stayed awake, which never happens (I have sleeping issues I'm in the process of getting fixed, which make it hard for me to get up usually). And on top of this the sneezing/flu-ish feeling/feeling like I'm gonna vom. 

There are a lot of people that are fascinated in the, uh, ""philosophical"" side of the opiate high (I can't think of a better word)--like when famous artists do opium or whatever, how their perception and experience changes. But the withdrawal is fascinating too. The first time I had WD I was in a foreign country on a nature tour of all things and it struck like lightning. We got off at this river/mountain that I could recognize as being incredibly beautiful but at the same time I had this feeling like nothing was right with the world, like someone dumped a nasty substance over everything; I had some kind of conviction that this is what Hell feels like, being surrounded by pleasurable things and finding everything absolutely atrocious and unfulfilling. I was almost in a state of shock by how unpleasant I found otherwise nice things. For whatever reason, that WD was mostly mental and not so much physical; maybe because it was my first one. 

What do y'all think? I have no concrete aim with this post. How is your day/high/WD going so far? I'm going to try to walk somewhere if I can muster it because I'm going stir crazy and then I have no idea what. I also need food.",1416084816.0

If it was for pain, do you still take them for pain?","I started taking opiates for persistent headaches that I still get when I come off of them (even when I'm past the withdrawal), but when I'm on them I get no headaches whatsoever. These headaches were sometimes extremely debilitating and have made me wake up in pain and throw up, other times they're just a 2-4 on the pain scale but can go up to an easy 7-8. I've never had them really checked out, but I did have an MRI and Lumbar Puncture a few months ago and nothing came up, so obviously it's not a tumour or anything... I've not told doctors about my headaches so I've never had them diagnosed, but I came to the suspicion that they're cluster headaches.

*I take opiates for the high as well, but I legitimately need them for pain.*

Now I have a pain in my tailbone area that's been going on for about 3 weeks I would say, I had it checked out last week and the doctor just gave me some shitty Naproxen (which didn't even touch the pain at all) it's EXTREMELY uncomfortable to sit down and about 7-10 when getting up from the seat.

We usually talk everyday and we typically see each other twice a week. 1.5 weeks ago we were supposed to go out for dinner and a movie, but she canceled last minute and hasn't spoken to me since.

I've been bummed out. I wish she would just tell me what's up. I have no idea if she's just going through some personal shit and wants to be alone or if she found out about something about me and doesn't want to talk to me anymore.

When she cancelled our date, she did it by text message saying something along the lines of ""hey babe I'm really sorry but I have to cancel because allergies are kicking my butt""

Yesterday I ordered one of those Giant Microbes plush toys. I got the hay fever one, it's basically a stuffed toy that's supposed to look like a grass pollen (the thing that causes allergies) and I'm having it mailed to her house. She has a dog, Red, that she's kinda obsessed with, so the note on her package says ""I found a way for Red to kick your allergies' butt""

She's supposed to get it in a couple days. Dunno if I should just consider us broken up if she doesn't respond to this. Anyone here date a normal person (non-addict/drug-user)?

Btw, just wanted to add that I'm female and prefer female pronouns but I won't make a fuss if you didn't realize...

What really bugs me is that I had a condom in case of a bad situation like being pulled over (you know the deal, drugs in condom in butt). But I forgot to give it to them.

Anybody got a better method? Ive googled several methods but I dont have a broiler to use....just a microwave and a ligher.

EDIT: About 10-15 pills and 4 or 5 different methods later this is the process that has given me the best results. 1) Use vice grips to flatten the pill as thin as possible.
2) Use scissors to cut it into tiny pieces. 
3) Get at least 2 but preferably 3 or 4 lighters to rotate between while heating the spoon
4) Heat until all the pieces have turned dark brown. Sometimes you may even take the flame to the top side of the spoon.
5) Put about 300 units of hot water into the hot spoon. 
6) Using a rig or something similarly shaped, smash the pieces around and mix it into the water.
7) I use needle-less 3cc syringe to suck up the viscous fluid through a large cotton. This isn't necessary however the liquid you have at this point in the process will be pretty thick and take a very long time to suck up through a cotton into a small needle.
8) Squirt the syrupy substance into the back of your needle. (you should have about 240 units after evaporation)

The dope is a nice tan color without any white flecks or grains like a lot of dope I've seen and it gives a great long lasting rush. It's really good shit in other words. But, like all dope, it is cut. Whatever the cut is is really sticky, clogs up the rig, and is generally a pain in the ass to draw up. Usually, I don't apply any heat, using the logic that dope is really water soluble, cooking it does not kill any bacteria but possibly some of the dope, and so all you are doing is making the cut more soluble. But, I also know that sometimes, dope is easier to draw up into the rig when heated. 

So I tried to see if heating it would make this dope a little easier to deal with, but when I applied heat, the water went from a nice, dark golden-brown to a much darker tarry looking substance that acted like jelly. It basically went from a liquid to a plasma. I was able to eventually get it in the rig, but I lost a ton of it, and I had to add so much more water that my nice fat shot turned into a couple mediocre ones, all of it not being able to draw up in a 1cc rig. 

I've never seen anything like this. Any idea what it is? I usually don't think too much about the cut in dope so long as it still gets me nice and faded, but this just did not look healthy for my poor veins. Any idea what this could be causing the dope to act like this?

TL;DR Dope was cut with something that turned the liquid in the cooker to a jelly-like substance when heated. What could it be?",1416271369.0

Anyway I get off work and I call this guy and go to his house so we can go cop some dems (perc 10's). I don't have my own steady connect so I always have to through someone else. I'm an average looking white guy with a full time job, girlfriend, religious parents. the type of guy you wouldn't expect to be a pill fiend lol.

We drive to the city to cop and get what we came for and decide we would whip up in my car and just chill for a couple mins. I find out he's actually my girlfriends cousin and a genuinely cool guy. I have a work phone and a personal phone. Since he didn't have a phone of his own we used my phone to call the dealer. I don't use my personal phone because I don't like dealers and people calling me on it because I don't want my girlfriend finding out i use. While were in the gas station he asks if he can go back to the car to grab his wallet which I let him do. So i drop him off at home and realize when I get home that my business phone is missing? I call it and it's off and I cant find it anywhere, so I message him on fb. I ask him about it and he completely denies it and acts like he doesn't know what im talking about. FUCK I can't lose that phone I'll get so much shit at work for it.

I beg him for it back and tell him I'll even pay for it but he still denies. He does however say he will help me look for it if we go back to all the places we went. (the dealer, gas station etc) and if we find it I buy him 3 packs So i accept and go back to get him. At this point I'm confident and know that I'll get the phone back if I buy him some stuff. We go down to the city and I park about 2 blocks away from where we were the first time and he goes back to the dealers house to see if it's there while I wait in the car. After about 7 mins he runs back to my car and tells me to get the fuck out of there. Low and behold he has my phone in his hand saying that he got in a fight with the dealer and got it back plus happened to get the stuff before he did that. 

Long story short is I pick up a guy to get percs. He steals my phone and realizes how important it is to me so he assures me we will find it if I buy him drugs if we do. Nevertheless I'm happy I got my phone back even though I lost $80 its alot better than $750. He even whipped up with me as well from drugs he bought using my money. The whole time he's talking about how mad he is that the dealer stole my phone and that he will always have my back if i ever need anything blah blah. What The Fuck? lol",1416404506.0

I basically sniff my dope, it is pretty clean, I get good philly stuff, but sometimes I get bundles of fire that still burns like a bitch when I snort. I am worried about the damage I am doing to my nose. Not only that, but I use cocaine also about 2-3 times a week (a gram spread out 2-3 sessions). Sometimes less, its very occasional. And it's all by myself since I have no friends (I'm a fucking loner addict, I get high by myself. sometimes I think I use cause of my lack of social life/skills)

I have tried plugging, but heard it is bad for you if you plug constantly. I am not looking to shove heroin up my ass 3-4x a day (thats how many dope sessions I have usually)

Now what I've noticed, is that my nose bleeds the next day sometimes from the cocaine... but my right nostril atm is very clogged up. Much more than my left one... and when I snort sometimes I can't get the powder in my nose because it is clogged up or something. I use straws btw...

I have put neosporin, bought some saline spray and afrin to try and clear it up. Have I done any permanent damage to my nose at all? I hope not... I've just started cocaine about 5 months ago too if that means anything, and used less than 10 grams in total so far.

If I used sterile needles all the time, and IV'ed properly, wouldn't that technically be **physically** less detrimental to your health than snorting all the time? This is a serious question.

I feel very strongly about what I wrote. I firmly believe this. This is what my comment became:


I think that it would be possible to be a functional addict in this situation, but it would be a rare occurrence for one to actually be successful in this endeavor. Out of maybe 1000 addicts, I'd guess that one person out of the 1000 would actually be capable of having the determination required to maintain a specific tolerance in order to maintain a proper habit. The other 999 people would fall victim to gluttony and end up increasing the size of their habits until they could no longer afford to properly maintain them.


One thing that I've realized over these last two years is that 99.9% of addicts are full of shit, gluttonous, and selfish. It took me a while, but I eventually realized the hypocrisy in the addicts around me. Their excuse for having a large habit is that it somehow just happened and that they're only trying to stay well, which is complete bullshit. They want to get as high as possible but they don't want to admit it. It's a lot easier to feel bad for somebody when they've convinced you that they simply have an illness contrary to believing that they simply are stupid, selfish, or some combination of the two. 


""I'm just trying to stay well,"" said every addict I've met. And they were *ALL* lying. They were all trying to stay high as fuck. If they *truly* are only trying to stay well, how come when they got hooked up and received that extra point of dope, they shot it all instead of saving the extra dope? ""He/She could have stayed well longer if they didn't shoot all that extra dope at once,"" I'd think to myself. And they could have. But, they chose to be more than just ""well"". And they will make that choice every time they are able to. 


Maybe they're all just too ashamed to admit how weak they are. Maybe there's a reason why they're addicts. Maybe it's nobody's fault but their own. Maybe the strong willed people in life succeed while the weak and selfish fail and become drug addicts. Nobody wants to admit it. 


YOU ARE AN ADDICT BECAUSE YOU ARE DUMB. YOU ARE AN ADDICT BECAUSE YOU'RE WEAK. YOU ARE AN ADDICT BECAUSE YOU ARE SELFISH. YOU ARE AN ADDICT BECAUSE YOU'RE LAZY. DRUGS NEVER MADE YOU A FAILURE. YOU WERE BORN A FAILURE. DRUGS CAME AFTERWARDS AS YOU TRIED TO SOOTHE THE FEELINGS THAT A FAILURE FEELS. THERE ALWAYS HAS TO BE LOSERS IN LIFE. YOU ARE ONE OF THEM.


That didn't feel so good when you read that to yourself, did it? It feels a lot easier to, instead, simply say that you are *sick*... That you have an *illness*... That you're just trying to get *well*... Because it hurts a lot more to simply admit that you are a weak and gluttonous person who likes the way it feels to be high. It's the easiest way to feel good and just like all the other failures in the world, you always take the easiest road in life. You shoot all that extra dope and increase the size of your habit because you are a selfish person. You are not strong willed. A strong willed person maintains their habit properly. They save that extra point for when their dope wears off and they become sick. They truly do try to stay well, nothing more. 


Strong willed addicts are 1 in 1000. 


YOU ARE NOT THAT 1 IN 1000. YOU ARE PART OF THE 999.

My favorite has always been Ms; the way they sort of melt in your mouth, and dissolve on your tongue so quickly, and go down easy with hardly any bitter aftertaste. I've learned to love the taste of Blues, like a sort-of horrifyingly bitter, chemical-ish, almost stabbing taste that would make any normal person gag. It's definitely an acquired taste, one that took me a very long time to develop, even with very regular usage. I'm sure everyone here can relate perfectly. 

I've always eaten them, so to me the size isn't very important, but I know it's a much different story for you guys who prefer snorting them. I know a lot of people don't like the Ms, 114s, or 224s because they're bigger and harder to snort. 

I've heard from a lot of people that the A-215s are their favorite, and if Ms didn't exist I would completely agree. To me, K9s and ALG-265s are about exactly the same, and the next best down the list, followed by 114s and 224s, which also seem about the same as each other. At the very bottom I think is V-4812s. I don't know why, but I always seem to get really hit-or-miss results with them, and I don't like how they're so much harder than all the other ones; it makes me feel like they don't dissolve as fast in your stomach and then get metabolized much slower. I know there are a few others, but the ones I mentioned are the only ones I have any experience with.

But anyway, so which ones are the best?

  For many many years I've had a lot of health issues: fibromyalgia, endometriosis - among many others.  I'm frequently prescribed pain medicine, most notably hydrocodone.  I have certainly abused it in the past. I don't know if that was to get high or because having any moment of any day with less pain feels miraculous and makes me feel unstoppable, if even just for a few hours.  I never thought of it as a bad thing - until I looked back and realized what I had been doing.  Lost my job, was failing school.  Not entirely due to this reason but it didn't help me and became my escape.  I've been dating my boyfriend for about 9 months or so.  When I told him about my struggles with the medication he was very upset and while I understood I don't think I've really grasped what has upset him so much.  I've never looked for it - I never ask for it.  Although I did realize that I know exactly what to say to a doctor to get them to prescribe it. So I guess I have to take that back. I have gone looking for it - I suppose through subtle manipulation of my various doctors.  I was prescribed some today.  The last few times the desire to keep my boyfriend happy has stopped me from taking more than necessary. I'm worried about this time.  I've been in so much pain the last few weeks.  I know I won't do the right thing. Maybe its good I realize that in advance?  I got the Rx during my lunch break and I felt almost giddy the rest of the day followed by intense bouts of guilt at having that feeling.  
I don't know what I'm looking for.  I am usually quite good at looking at a situation logically - even when it is about myself. But I feel blind in this regard.  Is my behavior bad with the way I handle this?  Is this a chronic problem for me? I can't really tell.

Been lurking for ~2 years but I've never really felt comfortable making myself visible on the internet for some reason haha.

Anyway I have a question for you guys. Around here tar comes in tightly wrapped plastic/grocery bags and it always ends up melting and sticking to the plastic and being unusable. I've tried keeping it in my wallet, a desk, even the freezer and it always happens. Not usually too much of a problem but last time there was around a point or two left in the bag and I couldn't get to it without some plastic sticking to it and I ended up just having to throw it out because I didn't wanna smoke plastic. I was wondering if anyone's found a way to store it to prevent this? ",1416367309.0

The pills I have are the yellow (E/40)s. The Alcohol method doesn't work and hasn't worked for about 3 years so if youre going to suggest that, dont bother. I feel like you should know that anyways and just want to see yourself talk.  ANYWAYS after about 20-25 pills and 4 or 5 different methods this is the process that has given me the best results.  I was thinking about making a howto with pictures, would anyone be interested? anyways heres the steps----
1) Use vice grips to flatten the pill as thin as possible.
2) Use scissors to cut it into tiny pieces. 
3) Get at least 2 but preferably 3 or 4 lighters to rotate between while heating the spoon
4) Heat until all the pieces have turned dark brown. Sometimes you may even take the flame to the top side of the spoon.
5) Put about 300 units of hot water into the hot spoon. 
6) Using a rig or something similarly shaped, smash the pieces around and mix it into the water.
7) I use needle-less 3cc syringe to suck up the viscous fluid through a large cotton. This isn't necessary however the liquid you have at this point in the process will be pretty thick and take a very long time to suck up through a cotton into a small needle.
8) Squirt the syrupy substance into the back of your needle. (you should have about 240 units after evaporation)
It comes out to a few shots, which is perfect for my gf and I to share a pill.",1416358182.0

Thank you very much guys. Happy nods  

Hello fellow opiphiles, it's been a while since I've posted but need your help. I've finally moved on from railing my junk and tried banging. I could rail .5g and feel nothing, so pretty much had to to be economical. Only thing is, I'm having a lot of trouble hitting a vein. I've tried maybe 3 or 4 times and am pretty sure I have not got it in there just right. I get this splotchy hive-y reaction where I shot when I feel like I've missed. I have fairly meaty visible veins and don't know what my problem is.

As far as I understand, you want to see a little plume of blood leak up into the syringe when you're in the vein. Then you want to pull back on the plunger a bit to make sure you're drawing blood back. I'm getting the plume, but not the draw. I'm using a tourniquet and everything, pumping my hand, gently pinching the vein, all that. I'm been dosing .2's (approx) and from what I understand I should *really* feel it insantly, even if railing .5 does little for me. 

Any advice guys?? I know I could've looked through the FAQ and used the search tool for previous posts that address this, but honestly I wanted to explain my situation before doing that to get more accurate feedback. Please help.

(oh and I'm spiking with a girlfriend who is as new to it as I am - but she has *shit* veins (docs have always had a lot of trouble finding them), any other suggestions to look for viable veins besides the bend of the arm?? Thigh? Pelvis? Hand?)

The same goes for other activities, from big wave surfing to heli-skiing. But our tendency to overestimate the risks of drugs hampers our ability to tackle addiction.","> What is the most dangerous activity you can engage in? If you guessed doing illegal drugs, you would be wrong. Extreme sports like big wave surfing, heli-skiing, cave diving, white-water rafting and mountain climbing all have a higher rate of risk to life and limb. Yet the question of a ban on these behaviors beloved by ""adrenaline addicts"" is viewed as ludicrous, even when the risk of death, say, in climbing Mount Everest once (until recently, about 1 in 3) is greater than the annual risk of dying from heroin addiction (around 1% to 4%). 

> when we talk about the “epidemics” of Oxycontin, methamphetamine or heroin, we rarely acknowledge that the majority of users never become addicted: Over the course of a lifetime, only about 10% to 15% ever get hooked. That risk is not insignificant: Few people would fly on a plane that crashed every tenth flight. But focusing on use as the main factor in addiction obscures what is actually at stake.

Stigma, My fat(needs to really lose weight for health reasons), best friend who smokes over a pack a day and was at 2 packs a day just recently told me on Friday ""there's going to come a time I wont have you using around me""  cause I go to his house every Friday and he's gone from each to his own this kinda attitude without seeing a fucking needle or me pissing away all my money or anything, just a few drops from my holy water jar when we're watching a movie or something. While we were heading out for some cheese burgers he even said  'I've become more of an alcoholic just because of you, cause when I'm around you I feel I need to use a lot more alcohol cause you're always on a whole other level' WTF. really? you need to get pretty drunk cause I'm often kinda high when we hang on the weekend? I told him, you want some 20mg oxy footballs? just ask and we'll pick up. As for heroin..we'll that's a little more tricky cause he doesn't want to do it...except awhile back when we we're getting really , really drunk with my other best bud J suddenly wanted me to 'bust out' my shit and 'fucking share it till it's gone'.  This I don't get... you don't get to tell me at the end of the night when I've barely touched dope-dope that's for later that weekend that I only touched earlier in the day because we we're getting smashed later to just bust out $50 worth of alcohol and share it. 


So weeks later I get him to give me 25$ early cause I work at a pot farm and sell him an 1/8th or 1/4 once a week...I'm thinking $5 for some eggs & cat food and I'll get a point , I was broke and eagerly awaiting some people I fronted to pay me back and to make some pot sales... so he agrees and we get some food and go to his house to hang out.  

When he figures out that I'm going to go down the road to get a tiny bit of dope-omg one point- fuck man the train is off the tracks~!!   I tell him 'look, just like you need to use this'../point to his ciggie/' I need to use tonight if I don't want to feel shitty tonight, and it's not even much' 

I even told him earlier that day on the phone that I needed to
""get well"" 

and he thought I meant buying some eggs or some shit alone and claimed he didn't know the slang and ""if i knew it was for dope"" and sorta trailed off. 

A little after that the ciggie comment he said ""yeah?... you're Just A Junkie Piece of Shit(emphasis on SHIT).... and it really bothers me that you've got that shit eating grin right now
 I'm trying to be more concise this time but let's just say he implied that I really didn't need it and it bothered him it was for dope.This convo was fairly long... we compared the fact that if he just stopped smoking he would get WDs. FUCK! I told him about the fact 20mg oxies are just a phone call away but I REFUSE to think I need to pay $20 for 20mgs of oxy when I can get 100mgs of heroin for the same price-less when I get .3 or .5 etc. And the fucking guy says if it was pills it would be fine~!! yes. fine. I say something like so if I was doing any type of pills of legal medical opiates/opioids it would be ok. ""YES, totally.."" he says emphatically. so he says -merely- ""but because it's heroin"" and I cut him off and say you know there are stonger drugs than heroin, right""  ""sure""  ""and that plenty of junkies prefer to shoot hydromorphone over heroin and that I don't shoot anything""

""and if I used pills all the time I would still get wds..instead of going a few days in a row with heroin and doing small doses of codeine I could use pills all the time and still end up with wds... you realize lots of people go from pills to heroin, right""

I mean fuck, this is my best friend and he works a high tech job and he's my bro but he needed it explained that methadone sucks compared to subs. or .. bupe I should say. he's fucking ignorant. 
only when I said ""so if I used pills all the time"" did he say ""well that would be a concern"" 



This to me is madness, here's my best friend being this rude about me using 2-3days a week and he fucking smokes lots of ciggies every day, drinks hard alcohol 2 days a week and he's really overweight, like I'm worried about his health fat, worried we're going to lose him wayyyy too early in life. He and my other best friend were joking around once when we were tanked and J-the fat one, said, you know you could die first...and we both laughed and laughed and lauged. Then the two of them got into this hilarious bit about who's going to die first and all J could say near the end was ""you could die in a car accident"". 

But wait, I swear it gets better... we talk a little outside as he smokes and he finally blurts out ""well why don't we go back inside and you share it, 50/50"".

 now this would be the second time he's done dope with me and I have to keep it a secret. I told him basically 'you don't get to call me a piece of shit and then ask me to share a measly 20$ worth when I'm trying to space this shit out and just use tiny amounts for 2-3 days until I can get some codeine, it's not like I'm trying to get fucked up. He's like ..""so, I can't be fickle, I can't just change my mind?"" tell him again -as I've said many times, throw in on some fucking dope like we each put in $25, or I get my shit and we each also pick up an oxy tab , nope... he suddenly just wants $10 worth of heroin. he doesn't want me to share when I've picked up $80 worth and have offered , or to plan ahead so we can throw in together, no he wants my dope when we're both about passout drunk or when I'm fucking hurting and trying to get some relief until i can get my fall back shit codeine or make enough to get food, codeine & more dope. 

WHAT DO YOU GUYS/GALS THINK?

We argued for a bit, fairly politely,  but after he went in and shut the door I just left because earlier that night after he called me a -REMEMEBER; A Junkie Piece of Shit I said ""whatever happens, whether I use a little or nothing tonight at this point you're going to be an asshole for the rest of the night , right?"" ""YES"" he says emphatically.

the next day he called saying,  you got a stupid answer to a stupid question, k...

and he told me he was ""a total dick last night""-a few times in a message he left me but of course he stopped short of saying sorry... admitting he was an asshole has always been his half assed way of saying sorry, I've seen it before. 

WHAT KIND OF STIGMA DO YOU DEAL WITH?- OR ARE MOST OF YOU IN THE CLOSET?

I have a friend that went thru a divorce this year-just like me pre incresed dope use btw.. his gf decided that she couldn't touch him or any other man ever again cause she had an abortion and she now hates herself cause she's batty religious and my fucking friend is bitter and yet hangs out with her doing 'date stuff without any sex' says he 'likes it' so he's also claiming now he's ""ADDICTED TO POT, SEX, FOOD, BEER"" EVERYTHING REALLY. So my close friends know but Mike is the only one that's annoying as fuck about it, he's in fucking AA but he still fucking drinks- so he's the only one that's been really annoying, my older bro knows I use, just not how much, of course my Mom doesn't know but she'd never understand reasonable opioid use after how her brother fucked that up for the rest of us. I'm 33 , I'm an adult, I don't really need to answer to anyone.  



I'm also the guy in my group of friends that's always been the most educated when it comes to drugs, I'm the guy who grew mushrooms and all sorts of legal plants and cacti, I'm the one people would come to when they wanted to know how much of X substance to take for their first time, I'm not bragging it's just that medicine, psychology and neuroscience have always been huge interests of mine, so it's just nuts to know this much about brain chemistry and feel judged for what is esseentially a small dope habit. 

Sometimes I think-jokingly- thank god for meth, cause the more crazy shit people see from meth users the more they accept popping some dillies, poppy tea, or even in some cases my DOC; heroin.

I've IV'd pills before and never have I come across something that just refuses to fully dissolve the way this does. I definitely got as fucked up on it as I have on other shit that actually breaks down but for some reason this stuff ends up with a sort of gelatinous consistency unless I treat it like h and just cook it, and even then, a lot of it still gets wasted because it'll get either stuck to the spoon as residue, or because it's so dense, won't really come through the cotton. Is there any workaround to this? Or am I missing some super obvious step?

Hi guys. I've been doing dope for about a month now and my tolerance is getting a bit high. I just relapsed after 1.5 yrs clean time from opiates, going to get clean again tho like next week for sure (WILL REMEMBER THIS AND WRITING REMINDERS ABOUT IT TO SO I WONT CONTINUE THIS BINGE FOR LONGER)
But anyways, I'm prescribed Xanax (for literal anxiety and panic attacks, it has made my social life (wait no that's still nonexistent), but being in the presence of people and being able to be more talkative with people SOOOO much better. I take a bar (sometimes 3mg for extreme rare cases) about 3 times a week, or sometimes not at all if I have a vacation at work. I've been on it for like 3 months and I try my best to not become physically dependent on it ever.

Anyways... back on topic. Whenever I take my H on a stressful/interview/presentation/social etc. day when I'm on Xanax, I notice that my high afterwards is so much better. This is most likely also due to my social anxiety, and opiate + benzo kicks anxiety in the ass! 

I don't shoot yet btw I snort. I don't IV, although it has been tempting lately and been thinking about it a lot... Really hope I stick with snorting. I hear the high is longer for snorting too since you aren't chasing that extreme euphoric rush. Snorting is good for me... for now. I hope so :/....

Anyways, since this is such a dangerous combination, how can I make sure that I am not close to OD range? I usually take my Xanax RIGHT BEFORE the event I need it for, and snort my dope usually right after. I snort an amount to get a good calm euphoric high (don't want to say amount for the sake that it's different for everyone due to tolerance), and will 2mg Xanax with not much tolerance be dangerous?

I got a half and I literally almost giggled like a child ...i was going 'yes...oh yes thank you junky Jesus' as I open up my half. 

The funny thing is after a shitty night and a really crappy morning I felt like I was over the hump and wondered if I should get less until a friend called and said he wanted more pot than what I owe him- then the moment I got back home my welfare check arrived- don't judge I just went thru a divorce and my long term gf left me while I'm working just a little under the table after supporting her ass for years. Unlike some people i see and speak with when i go in to update my 'employment plan' and such I'm TRYING to get back into thw workforce and get over a gap in my resume..thinking of just lying and saying I was working for my Dad for the last two years...can't say I was working at a quasi legal pot farm...

anyway... I've been eating shit food and my cat didn't eat last night, now I've got dope and i can go buy food and pay a little of my hydro bill- too bad I have to use money mart and that my fucking check doesn't even cover rent- but I'm not complaining. I'm going to make a donation to Junky Jesus when I get home later too- an old x-mas decoration my friends turned into a bong..now it's just my dope saving bank- 

Even with my contacts in tho it seems i get double vision when going thru WD, am I the only one? usually i can adjust my contacts and I'm all good, but when going thru wd my lazy eye seems lazier than normal. I'll need to buy a bottle of codeine too cause I don't want to be high every day nor can I afford it, when I'm not using heroin I take some codeine to smooth things out and avoid WDs. this is also great cause my tolerance is always going up and then right back down which imho is the only proper way to use dope... it's better to go easy on my dopamine system and save money than just try and do more and more dope. 

I've smoked a mere speck and I feel pretty amazing. i had an almost mini brain cum moment of tingly feelings after that first toke. I hear people always talk about tar on the West coast but I assume you guys are all Americans cause here on the far West coast of BC out in the burbs I get fine white chunks of dope that bust up to a beautiful white or off white powder. some of the greatest shit I've had in a long time actually looked a little light pink when i busted it up the other day... it looked weird but two lines in and I was sure it's good. 

sometimes I'm temped to use a needle cause I could walk less than 3 blocks and get free rigs and supplies Mon-Friday but I feel like the WDs from my light use are bad enough that I don't want to push it. sooo tempted at times but so far I just snort and smoke, and I do the former more cause I always tell myself this stuff is too good to smoke, sure I LOVE smoking but it's so wastefull.

I call what some of you call 'monkey water' holy water...i mix my shit with a little water in a tiny, old pot oil jar and then use a dropper to deposit it at the back of my nose, it's incredibly effective once you become aware that less is more and you only want to draw up a little bit of water at a time. a dry line followed by a wet bump here and there is also really, really nice.

praise Junky Jesus~! Today is going to be a good day. 
I'll be eating bacon and eggs tonight and fancy ice cream cones for dessert. 

I wish I could snap a pic, I'll find a way to do that some day soon, this is fine fucking dope. i know some of you get better prices and i can't wait to order online and get cheap grams but if a point is $16-20 then paying 80$ for .5 is just the hands I've been dealt. I'm trying all the time to go beyond retail prices...but I'll need some serious cash saved up first. good thing I'm going to get a job again, a large tax return...and grow mushrooms....

I only use heroin about 2-4 days a week and the other days of the week I'm using small doses of codeine to escape even slight wd or shitty feelings- there were weeks when i would go all week long and manage to get a little h almost every day but I've cut back. usually i make a half gram of heroin last all three days. 

But because a lady I know just paid me back for $55 dollars worth of hash(i got for free from the trim machines at work :D and bought an 1/8th- i felt like buring thru a whole half gram over the last 2 days with barely sleeping-not planned just happened ..got high and at one point just woke up in the sitting position with shit to do..idk how much sleep i got-was ok. or at least when i was about half way thru it I thought FUCK IT. 

The hash was free so...? and the half gram I just picked up moments ago? -heh-that will last Friday Saturday & Sunday/Monday cause I am barely going to touch it tomorrow or Monday-i work that morning- in fact,  my scale was bouncing .6 , .7 after i dumped the last of the old stuff in with the new- same batch. 

on the phone I'm go hmm' counting away.. what i can spend after selling weed and what I'm owed tomorrow... and my dealer goes ""I've got like 20 people to see so your humming and hawing wont work out dude"" so i told him later when i arrived that i wasn't indiscicive i had to count and make sure i could afford a half gram, i was fucking budgeting :P but I didn't use those words. i need more than heroin you know.oi vey.  and I asked him, since he was going to pull it out of his little satchel could he 'pick one with some nice solid chunks' 

I told him basically that while the one from yesterday was great I would like some solid pieces and he's trying to assure me ""it's all the same shit dude really it's just compressed and the other just got broken up"" and I tell him the bag from last night was great but ""I want to break most of it up myself"", i like that part of it all, don't take the fucking rituals away from me.  yesterday he got dropped off beside my place and had the hand off all cocked as he passed me, fair enough, but when he goes in that little bag I expect some chunky dope.


I mean come on, I'm handing you a wad of cashy, pull me out a chunky bag of dope- that's not so hard. 

So I normally get maybe one half gram a week, or a half gram and a .3, or a .3 and maybe a point some other day. Not a lot. but usually i use 2-4 days a week and I make each point last about an evening. i plan to make the .6 i have left last until about Monday night and maybe Tuesday as I already have some really strong 'monkey water' in my little tiny jar( one of those old pot oil jars) i can take little blasts of holy water from that tonight. it's really dark right now, a friend snapped a pic earlier, can't wait to post that tomorrow after he emails me. 

After one bag going so fast I'm really determined to make this one last days.

And that's how much I use, and how long roughly.  most of a .5 in what feels like one long day is really out of the ordinary for me, making a .3 last a weekend of evenings is normal for me. ",1416560579.0

I have about a gram a day heroin addiction. My question is thus: how much of the morphine would I need to take to feel threshhold effects? And how much would I need to take to get a decent high?

About ROA - Is this pill something I can smoke on foil like them roxies? Would I be able to snort this pill as well? Most people might come here and tell me to just bang it - I don't want to do that, but if I can't ingest it by smoking or snorting, I will. 

Anyways, I can't believe I just turned into one of those people who come here to ask newby-ass questions about their drugs, but I am very, very morphine naive. As I said, my heart is in heroin, not pills. So before I went and just swallowed an entire 15mg morphine, I figured I'd be safe and ask about relative dosing. I check the sidebar links and the opiate calculator for some reason doesn't list heroin as an option to convert from or to. Also, heroin is not listed on the wikipedia chart as well.

Problem is I get there having been led to believe (i.e. straight up told) that I wouldn't have to pay and, oh dear, turns out I do.

I think the pharmacist must have read the look of shock and genuine terror/panic on my face and maybe, based on the fact I look like any regular semi-respectable student rather than a shifty junkie, decided that I was somehow legit (and I guess they know they basically have me on a chemical leash anyway), she said that as long as I come in at a certain time, ask for her specifically and send off this application for prescription funding form, that she'll let me off for this first two weeks or so until I can pay.

Even though I absolutely intend to pay for my script (I used to even when I was unemployed and was exempt from the charge; the NHS is the one thing about this country I am legitimately proud of and would sooner go ill than rip it off), I almost feel kinda bad knowing I'm just using it til I'm straight financially and hand-ins are over, she was really nice and friendly and went out of her way to be helpful

Think about that for a second, I would happily sign away just about anything if it meant I could feel *normal*. Not to feel special or good, but just to feel normal.  
Remember when that wasn't the case?  
When if you'd been offered 1 wish you'd have picked something amazing.  
When every day didn't start with varying degrees of sickness.  
When you didn't have to monitor every emotion, because too much of any of them will likely lead to using.  
When having more than £50 was a good thing, instead of it being a constant temptation to score.  
When the 'bad part of town' was somewhere you avoided in a new area, instead of heading straight to it.  
When you still had veins left.  
When you hadn't burned every bridge and lost touch with everyone you used to know.

I need to get back on track, it seems like every time I manage to do ~4-6 weeks of sticking to my script, then I'll slip and score like 5 times in a week, realise what I'm doing and try to get back to where I should be.  
I'm at the final part of that cycle, I deleted all my numbers yesterday in an attempt to stop the spur of the moment relapses. I *could* get them back if I wanted to, but it'll take me a good 30 minutes and cause me a load of hassle, so generally it's enough to keep me on the right track.

Question for people who deal with ECP..

How hard is ECP when it's gotten in large quantities.. I'm talking a brick (literal, not 5 bundles) of dope. My guy says he grabs his stuff from ATL (I'm in the northeast), and it comes to him in a few huge ass rocks that he grinds down (using a coffee grinder or something) to bundle- out. This dope is like a dark greyish/tan, and has pebbles in it (copped two bundles). I ask him if they're cut, and he says no, they're just pieces of the brick that haven't been pummelled into powder... ""but it's def dope"". The pebbles are rock hard.. they definitely don't crumble with your fingers, at least easily. You gotta fold paper and use a lighter like you would a 30 or something.

Any experience with dope like this? How hard is a raw chunk of ECP.. or should I say ECR(ock)? This stuff is good, I'm just wondering. I've heard people breaking CD cases trying to crush pieces of dope like this. I know there has to be some cut in there or something.. possibly what causes the dope to rock in the first place? I've done my fair share of ECP, and this is the closest I've come to someone who grabs 7000+ dollars at a go... 

BTW, he said he doesn't cut it, and I believe him. We're cool... its a def possibility that it's cut before it gets to him for sure

I'm an undercover pharmacist- shrooms have real power, shrooms can refresh the mind and help change your life, my my Crypto-Pharm needs to remain a secret. 

I'm also really into the whole new virtual currencies dealio, I'm looking forward to buying all sortsof shit from the Dark Web. :D So I'm pretty pleased with this name.

I'm about to start growing mushrooms again and when I did the last time I gave away a lot of shrooms to my friends, same thing as a picker. So I do feel like a Crypto-Pharmacist..I even posted with that name until Puppy Linux failed hard, lol but I think Crypto-Pharm rolls off the tongue better. Pharm is the basterdized spelling of FARM- I work at a pot farm every two weeks, I'm about to start up a small 'pharm' in my apt again for growing mushrooms and I am obsessed with medicine, microbiology/mushrooms&mycology, psychedelics. psychology the human mind and so on...

OH, AND DOPE- I love fucking dope- WHETHER YOUR DOPE IS OXYCODONE, HYDROMORPHONE, POPPY PODS OR HEROIN- CHANCES ARE I LIKE IT. Some people like wine, some people like weed, I love every product the opium poppy can produce. 

I remember when I was a kid an old drunk lady that lived with our pot dealer was talking shit about the fact I was growing mushrooms and my one friend says to the other, barely containing his hushed tone and giggles...""Tell her about how he grew poppies in his parents backyard"" lolololol 

They tell her and this old catcher's mit puts down her smoke for a second and totally just erupts ***""poppies !!!? that's heroin***

My point is... maybe sometimes it's better to be a CryptoPharmacist.

Here's the dilemma, I'd rather wait till morning so I'm high for my whole brunch shift; on the flipside, my veins are trashed but doable 9 times out of ten, and they are at their worst in the morning.

I feel like as someone without a tolerance, 60mg of hydrocodone would make me nod hard.

However on the third and fourth day i can sniff a ton and barely feel it. I had heard that taking DXM can help keep your tolerance from building up, as well as potentiating at higher doses. So i looked up what dosage i should take. The link in the side bar wasnt working for me. So i just found some info on bluelight. I decided to take 60mg of just straight up DXM Syrup(no other drugs in the syrup) and wait an hour before i sniffed two bags. Well i can say it definitely potentiates, but more in the nodding area, not the euphoric area. I had a stack of pictures i was looking at while half noddinh out. I kept thinking that i was looking at my phone and trying to scroll over by swiping my finger on a paper photograph. I kept going like fuck, this isnt your phone its actual photographs. One of the pictures i was half nodded out looking at, it was a picture of my friend painting a canvas on a wall and i was actually watching him paint it, like i was looking at a video. Then i realized WTF? This is just a paper photograph. I also kept getting a kinda dizzy feeling from the DXM, not a nauseous feeling, just kinda dizzy. Anyone else ever had anything weird like this happen while nodding on.dope/dxm? All in all i probably will not try this again as i didnt really feel it was a good combo.

There's basically 3 options for them to assign you to: 10 classes once/week, 15 classes once/week, or rehab. The woman interviewed me today and I told her about how well methadone is working for me and all that jazz, so I think everything is going well. Then at the end she says, ""Alright, so I'm going to be referring you to treatment. I think that is the best option for you.""

I reiterated that I've been clean for 2 months with one slip-up, why can I not just take the stupid classes and get this over with? I then explained that it will cause me more harm than good because they're most definitely going to take me off the methadone! This is where she finally showed some sympathy and said that she has a friend/co-worker who knows more about how methadone programs work and is very pro-methadone, so she will ask her what she thinks should be done. I think she's under the belief that for some reason they'll still allow me to take methadone there, or that some bs rapid detox will be enough to keep me comfortable while I'm in treatment. I can only hope that this friend tells her something along the lines of ""He's in MMT, don't make him leave that you big meanie!""... or something lol.

So now I'm left not knowing what's going to happen and I might end up having to go back to rehab again even though I've been clean apart from one stupid mistake. I should have never even mentioned my slipup - I thought my honesty would work in my favor here, but clearly not. In her words, ""If you were in a treatment center you wouldn't have been able to slip up!""

I mean, all in all, the woman was super nice and at least acted like she was concerned about my best interests. She even gave me a hug after the interview and said the world needed more people like me (ie. generally calm, laid back, friendly). But fuck, man.",1416601059.0

Im still watching the cops and the dogs and i see that they are going to a different door. Im like ""FUCK YES! Dude they are going to a different house.""

Just a generalization of idiots on the internet. I haven't been here long at all, maybe 2 days, but you guys actually seem to be knowledgeable, which is amazing when I think about every single fucking person I know irl.

Nothing rubs me the wrong way more than uninformed people feigning intelligence cause they read new reports. My boy not answering is on par with that though. 

Anyway, I'm sure unless we have some people in here that live in horribly destitute areas of Russia and maybe Eastern Europe, no one here has any interest in trying Desomorhpine. Especially after hearing about all the bullshit that people peddle. 

I just wanted to say that Desomorphine is completely and 100% safe. Well about as safe as other opiates. The reason that its eating the flesh of those poor people you heard about is because the idiots that synthesize it are careless. Done properly it wont eat your flesh. Actually its not even the Desomorphine thats eating the flesh, its the Iodine and Phosphorous and other toxic chemicals that are left behind and not filtered out. This is nothing special. I'm getting this from wikipedia of all places, not some obscure scientific journal you'd need a subscription to read. If people took the time to educate themselves they'd know too.

From Erowid:
> Clandestine manufacture of desomorphine involves two steps: the extraction of codeine from pharmacuetical products, followed by the synthesis of desomorphine from the codeine. The extraction of codeine involves mixing the codeine source with organic solvents such as gasoline, adding a strong base and then adding an acidic solution to produce water soluble codeine salts that will reside in the aqueous layer. The codeine can be further extracted but many will proceed directly with the next step. 
> The extracted codeine is mixed with iodine, hydrochloric acid, and red phosphorus to reduce the codeine to desocodeine. Subsequently the desocodeine is demethylated into desomorphine in a one-pot synthesis that may take 45 minutes. There are some reports of attempts at neutralization at the end of the reaction using cigarette ash or sodium bicarbonate. Despite these efforts the solution is often quite acidic with a pH less than 3. **Analysis of Russian samples shows that what is purported to be desomorphine is often a sloppy mixture of 4 synthetic analogues of desomorphine, codeine, and other chemicals resulting from poor synthesis procedures.**

I don't like it when things are unjustly given a bad name as I've been on the other end of that once and it didn't feel good. Granted, Desomorphine isn't able to defend itself, but thats why someone has to. I may not have a degree in chemistry but thanks to the internet, I know more than your average person, so I feel obligated to.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and if you didn't -->

It's my first post on this sub, so please be gentle.
I'm a long time chipper and I'm trying to pinpoint why I'm having this problem.
Every time I take an opiate, when I come down, my nose becomes stuffed. When I go to bed I can't breathe through my nose sometimes because of this.

I've only been in withdrawal once when I used H for almost a month all day, about 5 years ago. Back then I didn't have this problem. Now I only use 1 day and stop for a week usually. And whether I take oral Oxy or I plug some junk the result stays the same, an annoying stuffed nose for around 3 days.

Anyone else gets something like that and it's not due to WDs?
Maybe it's some kind of rebound anxiety?

I've been getting fentanyl patches for years, but they've always been the Mylans. And I've gotten the procedure down. Recently though, I've been able to acquire some of the fabled Watson GEL patches (oh happy days). So now I can *finally* mess around with smoking patches.

Went on to google how, and found a bunch of methods for using foil. But people are all over the fucking place on exactly how to do it, with some ""guides"" straight up wasting stuff (horrors). So I was hoping someone here might be kind enough to post a specific step by step guide for how to smoke gel.

Specifically, does the goo release fent when it's heated? Or should you just reduce it and then smoke the film at the end? 

Also, when you are smoking the film does burning it destroy the fent? Some people were saying that you should take care to slowly *brown* the film or you'd waste it.

Finally, is smoking even an efficient way of taking the gel?

My most recent cocktail was 20mg of hydrocone (650mg acetaminophen), 1mg lorazepam, 40mg oxycodone (20 mg oral, 10mg snorted, 10 more mg snorted about minutes after), and 3 units of alcohol consumed over about 4 hours.

I frequently combine benzos and opiates and rarely will introduce alcohol into the mix. I am well aware of the dangers of this, however, I know how these affect even though I occasionally fuck up with the alcohol.

Just a question for fun, but predict my future. I use opiates to run away from life but the benzos are to maintain. I used to use oxy at 80mg 4-5 times per week, but I was about 3 months sober until about a month ago. So predict the following (I currently use the combinations about once or twice a week and am 18 years old, almost 19):

2. What drug or drug combination will kill me?
3. What surrounding this death compounded the likelihood of said death?

I've thought about shipping them ahead of time but I don't want my family to open the box when I'm not there and have to answer why I'm shipping something to the house rather than just bringing it with me.

Anyway, it's such a fucking bittersweet thing. I'm waiting all day, thinking why do I let myself be so emotionally controlled by this fucking substance?

I fell off the wagon the past 2 months and haven't been getting on /r/opiates. 
    
   In the past two months I've also been taking a small dose of suboxone each day to keep my mind off the dope. I was planning to slowly wean myself off of this shit because I'm still not truly happy being on suboxone.
  
Well today I was sick and haven't taken my sub dose yet so that
little devil in my head just tells me ""Hey Steve, just one last time, hit
up your dealer. It will be alright. You deserve it."" After pondering on
that thought for a few more hours and my withdrawals getting worse
and worse as time goes on. I fell through with taking my sub dose
today and texted my dope dealer.

So now I'm high on dope again....Into the flood again right? But I'm not
even enjoying the high. I'm just so upset I threw away 2 months of being
on subs to just go back to this shit. I know I'm going to wake up tomorrow
thinking this was all a nightmare, and I wish it was just a nightmare and
I could wake up now.

I know when it comes to heroin addiction, my dilemma is not huge 
here as this is such a dangerous lifestyle. I'm just looking for some 
support for you guys. I just want to hop back on my subs and wean 
off of them and just be clean. I have too good of a job to be doing 
this shit. I have too nice of a family for them to think I'm on this 
shit. I've really enjoyed having a healthy bank account these past 
two months. I wish I would have been a little stronger today..

I text him back, ""please tell me you're not taking off with my money?"".. I wait 45 minutes, usually takes 5. Try calling, try texting. I was so bummed out I almost cried. He was my only connect at the time because my main dealer disappeared and quit answering his phone.. 

Anyways, I never did get my money back, or dope. But I got things straightened out, and actually made a new connection who has access to the best stuff I've ever had.

We pooled resources so we could each get half a bun to be good for the holiday. We're broke fucks obviously when I was the main contributor at 27 dollars. But I figured we'd cop a brick when I get paid on Friday and all would be swell.

So spoilers, things are not going to be swell. My friend had weed in their car and paraphernalia, so when they got pulled over right outside Paterson they were arrested. And after being arrested they got strip searched and the bundle was discovered. Their car was impounded and the cops must've seen the gagillion texts from me asking where the fuck they were. 

They got bailed out by a mutual friends brother, but theyre facing a court date (and not their first either) for possession of marijuana and heroin and paraphernalia. However upon hearing the story I assumed bullshit (mainly because of bad past experience and how their habit has been getting a lot worse recently) and basically tore into them for ripping me off for 5 bags, and how I was always good to them, etc etc.

I felt like such shit when they called me crying telling me all the details and how if I didn't believe I could come to court with them, and how it hurt the most that I didn't believe them. This person has slept in my bed and we've always been tight (non sexual, just really close friends). I'm a fucking jackass. I decided to help with the impound using that check that was supposed to get us a brick and hook them up with a good lawyer I know. But it doesn't excuse my shitty assumptions. I'm such a fuck sometimes...

And worse yet, the first thing I think when I realize the stories not bullshit? ""Thank fucking JJ that I wasn't in that car, I have a double ACD and would've been facing time in prison"". Meanwhile my close friend is close to tears trying to conceal from their family that they got arrested AGAIN, are clearly not clean, and probably are going to lose the money they were getting for school and the car. Not to mention possible jail time as this is not their first encounter with the law, so they may not get PTI (which is new jerseys ACD equivalent I believe). And I'm still all fucking pissy about not being high for the holiday.

Lessons to be learned.","This is a pretty wild story but here goes. Few months ago I went to athens, Greece with my family. Prior to this, I had only been doing 30s for a year or two and had only snorted dope a handful of times. If you didn't know, athens has one hell of a heroun problem. They are pretty close to the Middle East but still Western Europe enough that the city (and rest of Greece) is very much a hub for smuggling dope and other drugs.

That being said, as soon as I arrived there I had no issues finding what I needed. For ten euros I received probably a .3 or .4 rock of dope that literally looked like a chunk of dirt. Very very dark brown, as close to black without it being truly black. I remember thinking "" what the fuck, did this dude just give me a pebble or some dirt??"" I remember tasting the residue on my fingers and my tongue stung with pins of vinegar or even a harsher smell like ammonia. I knew this stuff was dope at that point, but didn't know HOW good it was.

I had been offered needles by the guy I found dope from, (never got it from the same guy twice but there were literally guys selling it all over the city) but I turned him down stating that I only snorted. Glad I made that decision... I return to the appartment my family had rented (with my mother and father mind you) and happily locked myself in the tiny room I was sleeping in. I took out the dope and stared at it. I was only used to seeing powder dope, never seen tar before let alone this crazy substance before me. The consistency was like that of pure, uncut cocaine, hard as a fucking rock but powdery enough that it rubbed off on my hands.

I broke my fucking credit card trying to break the shit down, thinking using that technique would suffice. I ended up having to crush the rock with the bottom of my laptop, which it left a dent in. When I did get it into a powder(ish) consistency, I had nearly hurt my hand trying to crush the stuff. I looked down at what looked like two fat lines of dope. Me being dumb as fuck, or rather, me being an addict, figured I would be just fine snorting this substance of strange consistency that I had purchased from some Albanian guy with missing teeth. I snorted the first line and mynose reeled with agony as my sinuses exploded, the ammonia-esque cut went deep, deep into my heAd and skull. I cringed and tears rolled down my face. Then, a massive wave of sedation and pleasure greeted my agony, soothing it.

Damn, this is some good dope... I tilted my head down as my eyes lowered and my toes began to melt, coming up to my legs and torso until it filled my chest all the way up to my head. I let out a loud ""whoosh"" and smiled. Eyes barely open, I look down at what I thought was just a .05 line or so. I grinned and knew I had found some fun for the next few weeks, or so I thought... I snorted the line way too hard, in my semi-coherent state I figured I would snort hard and kill the fuck out of the line. I breathed in and vacuumed the line up, making a great noise as I did so.

BOOM

I felt the dope go straight to my brain and chest. I immediately drew a short breath and a stinging sensation built in my lungs... This was not good... Reminded me of snorting too much coke back in my college days -- except this was potent, not stepped on heroin from Afganistan or Pakistan, I was too high to remember what my Albanian friend had told me the stuff originated from. My nose had massive clumps of dope in it, because of my silly technique of snorting I had used as well as something I did not realize.

The second line of dope was not broken down nearly as well as I had with the first line. I had spent fifteen or twenty long minutes orchestrating that first line, denting my laptop, cellphone, and other items that would normally turn ""hard"" into dust. The second line was filled with chunks and pebbles of dope that now coated my nose and lungs. That's when things got hazy.

Euphoria and relaxation turned to panic and worry as my heart began to panic and beat faster than it should... Faster than it should be going after two lines of nice dope. I tried to calm myself down, knowing that a panic attack could happen or even worse, I could them send myself into cardiac arrest being in the state I was in. All my junkie experience and history could not bring my brain to make my body calm down. Whether it be because I was panicked, or because the dope really had me that bent, my chest and lungst started to get tight and hard as my heart rate sped up even more. 

I looked at the clock and realized it was midnight, my parents were probably fast asleep - would I have to wake my parents up on our first night on vacation in Athens,Greece, announcing I had snorted some potent heroin and I needed to call an ambulance or go to the hospital?? This only made matters worse as I pondered how I was in another country, without friends or a using partner to call out to and help me through this. ""Fuck"" my brain relayed to the rest of my body.
I grew short of breath and I laid down, starting to realize the situation was becoming more and more serious or even life threatening.

The effects of the dope were still apparent and strong, though the pleasure and feelings were masked by my worry and bodily strain. I could barely think or see anything, let alone breathe or stand up. I laid on the bed for what seemed like an hour in this state, barely breathing, my chest aching with each breath. My heart beat out of my chest as the rest of my body was stuck and slow. I figured if I laid down and relaxed, I would make it through this bout. Even worse idea. I looked at the reflection of myself on my laptop screen. My eyes were glued shut and my skin was so pale that I could not even recognize myself. This just made my heart hurt more and lungs press harder against my rib cage and chest.

I was going to have to do something. Either call an ambulance or wake my parents and tell them of my ""mistake"". I almost lost consciousness as I stood up, blacking out for five or six seconds. I stumbled to the door and tried to open it, my hands barely strong enough to pull the handle down and crawl down the 4 measly stairs down to where my parents were peacefully asleep. I managed to push myself out the door and down the steps, probably took five minutes to do as simple of a task. All the while, the agony and panic paired with the incapacitation of the heroin left me nearly unable to move.

I opend the door to my parents room and looked inside. There were my mom and dad, completely naive of my opiate use, having only caught me smoking weed of drinking beer a few times. I stared at my beautiful parents as I pictured what I was about to do: Wake them up and announce I needed an ambulance. From the floor of their room I let out a groan, which I repeated three times until they slowly awoke.

""What's the matter, son?"" My dad asked groggily as he awoke. ""Dad I am sorry but I snorted some heroin and I think I'm having a panic attack, my chest is going to explode""

My parents were quiet for a second or two before their brains fully registered what I had said to them. I repeated myself again and my parents exploded out of bed, rushing to me on the floor. They asked what I had taken, when I had done it, and what I was feeling. My mom tried to calm me down, thinking I was simply having a panic attack or some sort of deranged episode. I assured her I knew what I was talking about and that I would die if they did not call for help. I had never been in this state before. The only thing I could think of was that I snorted more than I thought, they asked me repeatedly how much I spent on it or how much I figured I had ingested. I told them ten euros worth, which I knew to be .1 of a gram. I don't remember much more after telling my parents how much I THOUGHT I had done.

My parents told me the next day that I passed out and eyes were rolling into the back of my head, Murmuring jibberish. I was speechless. In the morning, or afternoon, or who the fuck knows when I finally awoke, my mother greeted me with a blue screen on my laptop with some sort of Greek words all over it. In English I saw towards the bottom of the screen:

""Price of heroin in Athens, Greece: 10-20 euros for Half gram, 30-40 for full gram"" it all hit me at once.

I had snorted a half gram of strong , Middle Eastern heroin in two lines. I was used to doing one or two .1bags at a time snorted of East Coast dope, which was probably 5 times less potent than this shit.

Lessons to be learned from this: when in another country, particularly one plagued by heroin addiction and pretty near the area of the world where ypthey make fucking heroin, test the quality of your dope before you go about doing your ""normal"" or ""usual"" amount.

And of course, as shitty as the experience was, that goddamn Greek dope was the best I've ever had. Nothing has ever or probably will ever hit me like that shit did.

i used the vein in the pit of my elbow, but before that i tried a vein beside it and couldn't draw blood so i moved fast- thinking about mushroom growing i know i have to work fast to avoid contams, i was relieved when it was easy to draw some blood with that classic injecting vein, the one the hospital uses and the first one most people probably think of. 

the dose was weak, as i intended it to be, but i can definately feel it, just caught myself smiling out of the blue after a long day working at the pot farm...

i saw an air bubble near the end and got rid of it and tried to put the last of the doses in the vein i orginally tried for, i may have missed it and put the tiniest bit into the tissue beside it. I've heard about the rush but other than noticing it right away I'm not really high... tho i feel like it's building and building pretty fast. i have a small tolerance after going heavy with my snorting this week but we're talking like a point during the evenings, more on the weekend- all snorted. 


HERE'S WHY I AM A LITTLE SCARED, THE VEIN THAT WORKED OUT JUST FINE IS A LITTLE DISCOULOURED, I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING ABOUT THAT WHEN I WAS READING UP ON THIS, IT'S LIKE A LITTLE TINY CIRCLE OF A BRUISE. Now that i think about that it's no so different from when i have my blood drawn.

around the injection site(i am very very pale) i see a reddish colouring . JUST CHECKED..PHEW. IT'S GONE DOWN A BUNCH ALREADY. AND THE LITTLE DOT LOOKS OK, THE VEIN WHERE I TRIED TO HIT AT FIRST LOOKS WORSE BUT JUST TWO LITTLE DOTS. THE VEIN THAT WORKED WELL LOOKS PRETTY GOOD.

Still feel myself climbing atm. feels pretty good, i am going to avoid dripping any of my holy water into my nose for a few hours. in fact i don't think i should take a toke either. definately climbing, it's very similar to snorting but i feel a tingly feeling spreading and the mood lift is much more pronounced. rubbing my face now and then..something i do when I'm high from sniffing but it just takes much longer to do.

All in all i am a litle worried and slightly freaked out even tho i am high, cause it went well but not being able to draw blood at first makes me worry about cross contaimination and such, i considered breaking the needle and just taking it up the nose after the first stab.

I will not be doing this again any time soon or withj this bag i have. if i do it again - and i will- it will be weeks from now, maybe near New Years. i am getting pretty high off a small amount of dope but it feels mostly the same. 

i think i used too much water as the syringe was almost full. plus i didn't use vitamin c. next time I'll use a lot less water and make sure it's got a nice colour to it. 

starting to calm down and relax. if i was going to have a terrible reation it would have happened already i think. 

I know i made some mistakes and they shouldn't be taken lightly, please tell me i am going to be ok tho. if the spot looks even kinda weird tomorrow i am going straight to a walk in clinic. ",1416892955.0

I had a death in the family not long ago, still not sure what it was, but he used painkillers frequently and people said it may have been a needle. That combined with regular articles over the past few months of H batches being mixed with fentynal, do any H users worry about getting a bad batch? Do you ever consider switching over to pills? 

The way I look at it is, even if you are an extremely responsible user. Let's say you've been doing H for 20 years, you only snort, you only use on the weekends, you buy from the same dude. I'm setting up the scenario such that you can not do anything more to be responsible. You have your money in order, and you enjoy some H on the weekends ( I know this is far fetched, but bare with me). One day you get a bad batch, do the same amount and OD. So even with all the proper precautions, something out of your control can kill you. Is this a regular concern? I don't use H so I don't know. Or can those of you who use regularly vouch for what you get every time such that you dont have to worry about that?",1416885822.0

getting to the point, i've been using daily for almost 2 years with a break here and there. i thought i was being good about rotating, but i was npt being good enough, possibly because i've been using pharms most of the time and you can't change the concentration like you can with heroin. thanks to the tolerance  built up with heroin, it's always taken me at least 6 shots of morphine or multiple shots with pills to get the job done.  
i've lost my elbows, forearms, wrists, i'm about to lose my hands, lost the big veins in my ankles and am really aggravating the big ones in my feet. i'm afraid to use them because they're starting to hurt.  
i know using 31s would make this easier, but i can't afford to buy buy a box of them. i'm lucky that my exchange has started getting 28s again instead of horseneedle 27s.  
  
long story short, where else can i hit? i'm not down for the neck or the femoral artery because that's just asking for a load of shit. i've tried hitting in my lower legs, but i can't get it even with a brand new needle. 
i'm trying to kick and i would usually just say FUCK IT, deal with not being able to hit and suffer it out. but it's winter. i'm cold all the time. i can't handle the physical WDs without tapering off. last time i kicked cold turkey, i was on tour as a roadie with my friend's band and it hit in indiana (we started in oregon). i was also kicking methadone, so i'm still not sure what the difference is between the WDs. it was ok aside from lack of sleep though, because i was hella busy the whole time. 
well. i left as a roadie and came back as the bassist for the band and they all know i use, they don't judge, and we're all on the same page that i need to get off this shit before it's go time in february, no matter how functional and covert i am when i'm gowed. bad business, it's stressful for me, i'm just not down for it.  
  
sorry for the tangent, i kinda missed the people i know from here. POINT BEING. i'm tapering off right now. i have the best motivation to kick i've ever ad, i have a good group of sober friends who are there for me if i'm like I WANT DRUGS. i'm kicking ass on re-learning bass and i guess i was awesome as a roadie even though i was hella sick on a 3 week US tour crammed into an astrovan with 3 friends and every square inch of the back crammed with gear. it's time to put the drugs down and replace them with this. it's all i needed, a good replacement, something i care deeply about and love doing, and everyone else wants me involved too. 
but it's really hard to taper down when you spend an hour stabbing at dead veins and ultimately blow out. it's wasteful which is also a huge issue right now because my supply is limited. i used to be such a pro about hitting. i could cook and hit in fucking 45 seconds if i had to. so... speak to me of your wisdom. i have some really good, visible veins in my legs, but i can't register on them! it's crazy! as long as i don't fuck up and get back into it, i only need to do this 10 more times at MOST. it's really frustrating.   
  
kicking during winter is such BS because i'm always cold and my veins are all sucked down into the far recesses of my body. i just can't get to them. i though t i was being very gentle with my feet, but i guess not. they're great to hit, but it's painful and i don't trust that.  
  
i would kill for a suboxone tab right now. one of those bastards got me off a short, but gnarly heroin habit when i IVd it in quarters..... i could probably get one if i really tried, but i don't want to spend the money when i know i can just sweat it out, as much as it sucks.",1416865078.0

I saw the Bob's but have been really underwhelmed with what I have gotten lately in terms of effect. Anyways, I said screw it, something is better than nothing. If anything I can stop my exploding colon and calm these legs a little. Most of you know, any relief is very welcome in that special hell we make for ourselves. Not looking to catch a buzz at all, I grab 2.5 pounds, 5 of the half pound bags. Took it home and washed them up withsome warm water and lemon. Shake shake shake. Low and behold, the waterI drain out is the nice dark brown color. Not the off white, yellow, this is some weak tea. I was still skeptical. Drank the nasty shit and waited. About 45 mins later I am glowing and feeling amillion times better. Not smashed or anything. I just def have a solid opi buzz going and am happy it was with tea. It should hold me over for at least a day or so. I figure I can make another batch or two tomorrow and go get my script early wednesday. 

So, Bob's Mill, for reasons I am unaware of is back to not washing. At least where I am. 

My process for making PST. 
I use 30mg methadone daily for pain. A bit of a tolerance, nothing crazy though. This dose had me at about what I would expect from 30-50 ish mg oxy. 
2.5 lbs Bobs red mill,
1 large lemon
1 gallon container. 
enough WARM water to cover just to the top of the seeds. 
Add all of your seeds into the jug. Fill with warm water until the seeds are barely covered. Add in 1 large squeezed lemon.Shake the absolute tits off the jug for only 5-10 mins. Strain with whatever. Hold your nose and drink. Easy peasy. 

As always, don't be stupid with tea. There is no way to accurately measure strength. I have done this many many times. I am a trained medic and always keep a bottle of narcan in the fridge. Really, don't even use it as a first choice. It is a mess, time consuming and will def get you funny looks at the grocery store.

The community divided into 2 groups.,"Hello again. I love to bring you updates from the Heroin capital of Europe, Athens-Greece!

Some people here have watched this documentary about ""sisha"" in Athens, which is Crystal Meth. *I consider it to be sensasionalist, innacurate, so I would like to give a detailed report concerning the situation here.*

Most of it (if not all of it) is **bad news**; however I really want to contribute to the discussion in an analytic fashion.

Actually, ""sisha"" **is** Crystal Meth (3 quality 'categories'), and it appeared on our streets, VERY VERY VERY recently in comparison to, say, the U.S.A. It appeared circa 2009-2010.
Due to the fact that it appeared so recently, people were not educated at all concerning its pharmacology/toxicity and harm reduction (if any). I've lost so, so many friends from this poison :( :( :(

Some died due to **health complications**, some died due to **violent attacks** (*violence appears after lots of days without sleep and food*). Some were **closed into mental institutions** (*permanent psychosis*) and others simply decided to abandon or **SELL their houses**, in order to **live as homeless in the 'sisha' spot**, which happens to be *inside our version of 'Central Park'*. Others, **dissaperead** without me knowing why.

Since all this is very **new** to our scene, *there are NO rehab programs for Meth* yet (private or State). Very sad and in some cases, pathetic.

**Note:** Due to the fact that junkies that never touched this stuff nor like it, *the 'spot' and the community was DIVIDED*: The 'pure heroin' spot moved many blocks away to avoid all the violence and exposure to this shit, and the rest (the majority unfortunately) moved inside 'our central park'.

In our 'spot' (the pure junkie spot), if people see anyone holding a meth pipe into their hands, they might get beaten and jumped and get told to go away. 

QUALITY ANALYSIS:

(A). **10**% of the times, it's *pretty decent quality* (or even excellent quality), even though meth is very dangerous and neurotoxic, even when using high quality product. This high quality product usually has the appearance of semi-transparent crystals. When you blow out the smoke, *it creates a rainbow effect on the atmosphere*... 
**Cost**: *20 euros for a quantity that will last for 1-2 days for 2-3 persons.*

(B). **50**% of the times is a *mediocre product*, but good enough to not cause amphetamine psychosis if used ""responibly"" (very very rare to tweak responsibly). Color of the crystals: yellow (very good), pink (pretty good) and semi-transparent, but shards (not so good)... 
**Cost**: *5-10 euros for a quantity that will last for 1-2 days for 2-3 persons.*

(C). The rest of *40*% of the times, it is *THE shittiest product on earth*, cut with *battery liquids*, and the colour of it is milk white (bad news), or brownish-yellow (even more bad news). 
**Cost**: 2-5 euros for a quantity that will last for 1-2 days for 2-3 persons.


**Paraphernalia Cost Note**: 
The pipes are **2 categories**: The cheap ones that break easily and burn the product cost *50 cents*. The good pipes *cost 2-5 euros*, but they last *weeks*, you can *clean them* and they *don't break easily*.

MY EXPERIENCE:

The year was December of 2009: My ex-boyfriend was a tweaker, and I, a heroin and flunitrazepam junkie. He really knew the right boys in order to bring A+ quality into our house (we lived together). **I only used Meth for 3 days in my life**, and even though the euphoria was otherworldy, *I couldn't sleep unless I took triple dose of Flunitrazepam and Heroin, and I developed a small psychosis the 3rd day I was awake and starving*. 

Never touched it again in my life -- very thankful for that. 

We broke up because he was irresponsible with his use (he was also Bipolar type I -- bad news). When I told him I want to break up with him, he beat me badly, and returned later to the house **with a gun**. We called the police, and thankfully, I am alive and well.

LOST FRIENDS:

Last week, a very dear friend of mine (*a tweaker & junkie*) who happened to be a talented guitarist and composer was STABBED 7 TIMES IN THAT EFFING SPOT because he owned to a dealer **FIVE** MOTHERFUCKING EUROS.... When the paramedics arrived he was dead.

THE STREETS NOW:

Even experienced, veteran junkies, avoid the Meth spot like there is no tomorrow. There is a good benzo market there (there is klonopin which is nowhere to be found elsewhere), but we won't risk going there just for that.

I am happy that the Heroin Open Market is now seperate, because I feel really safe. If you 'blend' socially and aisthetically with this spot, there is zero danger (unless you are not streetsmart and you'll be scammed, of course -- this is not my little pony).

TO AMERICANS, EUROPEANS etc THAT WILL VISIT ATHENS IN THE NEAR FUTURE:

**Avoid at all costs to go to that fucking meth open air market**. This 'central park' is called in greek **'Pedio tou Areos'** (""*the place of Ares*""). Don't even go there during the day to walk your dog. If you do, you will see tweakers that make us junkies look obese, talking to the trees, shitting all over the place, fucking publicly without protection, and many more pathetic behaviours. Avoid, avoid, **AVOID**. 

If you'll visit Athens in the near future, contact me. 

** Safety first **. 


P.S. I am a downer person. I am so sensitive to uppers, that even a nice, hot Espresso will do the trick for me (hell, even soda makes me hyper when nodding). 

When I experimented with meth for only 3-4 days back then, I needed lots of flunitrazepam and heroin to just return to my baseline.

2nh5y3,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2nh5y3/some_simple_chemistry_tips_for_lowlevel_opiates/,19,https://redd.it/2nh5y3,chemistfromheaven,Some simple chemistry tips for low-level opiates,"Here in Australia the codeine tablets we buy have 500mg APAP (the word here for it is paracetamol so I may use them interchangeably), 9.5mg codeine and 5mg phenylephrine. This means in your average CWE, the final product ends up being a roughly 3:2:1 mix of the chemicals by weight, as phenylephrine is just as soluble in water as codeine is.

If you are wishing to do any modifications to your codeine (such as a demethylation then acetylation in a homebake-type process or something like that) then you'll want to get rid of the APAP and anything else to limit impurities in the final product.

When doing a CWE, if you evaporate the water, what is left will be anything from a yellow to a white paste. There are two ways you can eliminate paracetamol:
a) Acetone wash (we can buy it from some hardware stores, there is a fair chance this eliminates the phenylephrine too (I'm really not sure) but that may be less of a concern to you Americans)
b) Acid-base extraction

Paracetamol is an acid, which means in an acid-base extraction, where only the positive cations will make it through to the final product. Basic acid-base chemistry.

Just get a solution with the CWE product in it, add a solvent layer to it (something non-toxic is preferable I think, even something like vegetable oil would do the trick) and then pour in a solution of some base. This will attach -OH ions to the codeine molecule, replacing phosphate or sulphate or whatever it was, and the less-soluble codeine freebase will be precipitated out of the solution into the solvent layer. Keep in mind that freebase codeine is still relatively soluble in water so keep it to a minimum, I would say only a few mL per gram, which can be had by evaporating and stirring until the volume is low enough then filtering.

Seperate that solvent layer away from the water layer with a syringe/pipette/something, then simply add a fresh water layer, and add an acid of some sort. Vinegar produces codeine acetate, citric acid (dissolve first) codeine citrate, hydrochloric acid produces codeine hydrochloride, etc. The stronger the acid, the less you'll need, but for 1g of codeine freebase you'd only need a tiny bit as is.

Evaporate and you'll have your codeine (+ phenylephrine if using these pills I use)

There are ways to convert it into more potent opiates, e.g. if you do a red phosphorous/iodine reaction from the work ive done on paper and stuff it seems to yield dihydrocodeine, just like how reacting codeine with thionyl chloride to replace the 6-hydroxy group with a Cl atom will then enable the hydriodic acid to reduce it even further to dihydrodesoxycodeine, which is then demethylated to dihydrodesomorphine, ""Krokodil"".

The hydrogenation into dihydrocodeine makes the other links a lot more stable, which means that HBr will be able to demethylate it successfully without destroying half of the molecule. I'm not going to pretend to know what's changed and stuff but pretty much dihydro-anything will be more stable than if it wasnt the dihydro form.

This basically means that if you do an RP/I reaction on the codeine (refer to Rhodium archives on erowid.org), and then take your product, ""reflux"" with HCl or HBr you'll get some level of dihydromorphine. Of course reflux is just distilling into the original container, so you could just use a saucepan with a lid and the hole sealed with an ice pack on top or something and let it sit for about 3 hours.

The resulting product can then be acetylated either by whatever methods with acetic anhydride you know (but, see, I can't acquire AA very easily), or by acetylating the 6-hydroxy position to make the molecule 6-acetyldihydromorphine by heating acetic acid (vinegar, use white vinegar or else you'll get a coloured product) with sulfuric acid (concentrated is best but if you reach the boiling point of sulfuric acid it shouldnt really matter too much because if you hold it at pseudo-reflux it will purify itself consistently). About 0.3mL of 98% sulfuric and 1mL of normal vinegar for every 1g of product you want acetylated.

Then you can neutralise with bicarb soda (which is great because you don't really need a pH reader, just keep adding bicarb until it doesn't bubble) and evaporate to get your product, the bicarb and sulfuric will form sodium sulfate, which is insoluble in ethanol whereas the opiates all are, so you can purify by washing with methylated spirits or some other pure as fuck ethanol and then discarding the gunk.

Fuck knows how to get rid of the phenylephrine, I promise once I get a chance to experiment with it (I'll extract it from some phenylephrine tablets I have lying around then try it with some different solvents) I'll update this, although for the majority of the audience it shouldn't matter too much.

Please message me if you have any issues

Edit: I found a new starting point just doing some stuff here, you can cleave the morpholin and ethyl ethers in the Pholcodine molecule with HBr or HCl or HI or something if you again convert it to the dihydro form. This will leave you with dihydromorphine, with 3-ethyldihydromorphine as an impurity.

Also a way I haven't tried and thus didn't mention earlier was a reaction that requires expensive catalysts, but if you have any way to get platinum, put it in a codeine/morphine/etc solution, put it in a microwave for 5 minutes at 450W at about 20C. If you aren't using codeine, then you can use nickel as well, but boost the temperature to at least 80C or so, yields will be absolutely terrible however. In my opinion I'd rather cook it up meth-style.

Some more thinking suggests that you could possibly replace acetic acid with methanol in the above acetylation reaction to turn it into a methylation reaction, which will generate heterocodeine if you are starting with morphine, thebaine if you are starting with codeine, and so on.",1417009207.0

Then I remembered I had heroin, and all of a sudden I wasn't feeling fine enough. 

It's been two months since I had gotten seriously drunk. In fact, i'd only had two or three drinks since then, and thus the five drinks put me into a stage of seriously enjoyable tipsiness. 

I, with as much care as I could muster, dragged the chiva out of my mint tin. Despite my inebriated state, I managed to produce a perfectly smooth 4 inch by 3 inch piece of foil, which I gently placed the tar on. 
Then, needless to say, I smoked the tar and quickly found myself to be quite high. 

The feeling of heroin mixed with alcohol was that of floating on peace; I was not peaceful, but I was merely riding a wave of peace that I had no control over. Chill house music played on Pandora, and I was forced into a closed-eyed, semi-comatose state by the sheer pleasure of the moment. I was not myself - I was tranquility - and I did not care. All worries of respiratory depression or of overdosing that had plagued me before dosing were obliterated. The euphoria was not like that of methamphetamine or ecstasy. No instead it was more personal. It felt genuine, as if it had emerged from my own soul, where it has been hiding my entire life. 

So I sat there with my eyes closed and my head tilted forward into my computer, with relaxing, french house music playing. If I had the option, I would have stayed there until the end of time. 

Alas the heroin rush wore off, and I became inclined to drink more Jack Daniels. The pure beauty was gone, but I could still find tranquility with alcohol and the post-rush effects of heroin. Now I write with the soul of heroin and alcohol souring through me, and with the intent of sharing that soul with this subreddit.
I know this combination is dangerous, and has killed many people before their time. I recognize that I glamorize this combination in my post, and for that you have my apologies. Always keep in mins that the fact that the high is great does not mean that it is worth the risk. I have played the fool in mixing these to drugs, and do not recommend that others do so. Tonight I was lucky, tomorrow someone else may not be.

(Mini reflection and advice,"So I had my first opiate at 16 (2009). Took some tramadol my uncle had left over from his back surgery (he wasn't taking them anymore). 

Next time was when I was like 17 (2011) and I snorted my first 30mg oxy. 

Between 18 and 19 (2011-2012), I had percocets once and dilaudid once. 

When I lived in Philly (Jan 2014- Jun 2014), I was doing blues anywhere between 3 and 5 times a week, but no more than one a day..

I moved back to my hometown in July and have been doing blues like twice a week, on average, but in higher dosages (highest was 105mg, average was 75mg).

Today my guy was out of blues, so I bought 3 points and he gave me a fourth for free.. I did 3 of the stamps, ate 3, 7.5 vicodins, and did a half mg of xanax. I was nodding my face off and it felt great but I'm worried I opened the floodgates..

Tl;Dr- I've slowly developed an affinity for opiates and I just started dope and I don't know how to proceed. 

Should I keep buying blues? It seems like a waste of cash but a better control method. How long should I wait between h dosages to avoid building tolerance?

2ngmeu,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2ngmeu/question_about_opiates_for_pain_management_and/,10,https://redd.it/2ngmeu,throwawaydune59,Question about opiates for pain management and addiction - skip to the TL;DR if you don't want to read a bunch of background,"Been a lurker / throwaway poster here for a while. 

So I realize that using pain medications for pain treatment are a big gateway to opiate addiction. For the sake of this conversation lets assume were talking about oxycodone, though this would sensibly apply to any opiate. 

So while its obvious that prescribed pain medication can often result in addiction. But in my experience, along with other anecdotal observations, this is not always the case. I realize this is just me repeating obvious fact - ""it happens sometimes it doesn't others"" - duh. 

So lets take my experience. I broke both legs at the age of 17 in a car crash. I had only ever had tylenol 3's before this, maybe for a day or two for an eye injury in high school. Though I had smoked weed, drank alcohol, tried salvia once, and some other purportedly psychoactive herbs (blue lotus, damania, etc.), I'd never really had any opiate experience. After my injuries in the crash, I had high doses of dilaudid, morphine, and oxycodone in the hospital, and then took 15 mg of oxycodone every 4 hours at home for about 4 months. As a result of being hospitalized for 4 weeks post accident, while being under close observation and having my meds dispensed to me by doctors I had few pleasurable opiate experiences and didn't really notice their potential for causing pleasure. Even when I got home, I must have already had a tolerance from the hospital stay, and 15 mg doses didn't cause any euphoria really, they just helped my pain. At the end of 4 months my surgeon told me and my parents that 15 mg every 4-hours was a lot. He told us to ween down, which I did successfully over a few weeks. He said that the reduced dose would raise my pain as constant medication would lower my body's natural ability to fight pain. When we asked about mental/physical withdrawals he said it wouldn't / shouldn't be a big problem, though I'd likely be in a worse mood from the pain while my body adjusted. Over the previous months I'd taken larger doses (30-60 mg) for recreational purposes and had had some fun experiences. I did this again with left over meds a few times over the next year as I went to school. I guess my main questions is, obviously I was a bit lucky, and many people are not so lucky. However, wouldn't taking 60-70 mg of oxy every day for so many months have causes some bad withdrawals, or made me addicted? We always say never use consecutive days to avoid addiction, but I did this for so long. I know I wasn't really chasing the dragon in the sense that I was taking more and more to chase a high, but isn't the constant use likely to cause an addiction? Hopefully my question is somewhat clear, I know it seems like i'm stating the obvious, or just asking a silly question, but I think my question's somewhat clear. 

I've now been on oxy for a week after another related surgery, 2 years later, and I've been kind of chasing pleasure a bit more this time. I haven't been taking 15 mg every 4 hours, except for the first 2 days. Recently, I've been taking 3 mg in the morning, then 2-3 once my pain comes back, and then I've realized that my pain has mostly subsided. So i don't need the meds too much any more if I use tylenol and advil. I've been using maybe 15-25 mg at night to get me through the night when the pain is worse and to help with sleep for the past few days. Also, it means I don't have to wake up to redose with multiple 10 mg doses through the night. I think I'll stop now, and save the rest of the meds for sporadic recreation, spread out at least a week apart in between, and maybe share with my friends too. I have maybe 350 mg of oxy left in 5 mg pills. I guess this isn't too relevant information, but basically I'll stop using it for pain now that I don't need it, and I wont be taking it nearly every day. Maybe once a week with probably bigger breaks in between. I then definitely wont buy more after, as I have no sources and would have definitely experimented more at college before this surgery, as I've kept my ear to the ground ever since my experiences last year. Besides some seed tea and codeine, I haven't had oxy again until now (2 years later). 

****TL;DR (main point/question of this post)**** - Why didn't I have worse mental / physical addiction after using 15 mg of oxy every 4 hours for about 4 months, following injuries? How do people get away with this (sometimes), when we tell recreational users to limit use severely and never use consecutive days if they want to avoid a fast addiction?",1416989630.0

Help?,"Hey guys I've been a long time Lerner of this sub almost a year even when id only take opiates once a month then but lately things have been changing a lot. These past 2 months pills Have been a big part of my life and I've been catching myself doing things that make me feel like the drugs have finally made negative impacts on my life.  I'm 22 I work full time and want to go back to school and get a degree, hopefully starting January. Anyway these past two months I've had more access to pills and have been doing things like lying to my girlfriend parents everyone about things like why ""I'm working"" late or what im doing . Why I randomly have days where I'm sick, broke etc. (usually copping to get them)

Well last week my cousin came from Chicago and he has been using pills a long time and when I told him I use he hooked me up with his connect. This new connect almost always has perc 10s, 20s op 30s, 40s and he's reliable. Anyway because I found him I've been thinking about selling. I figured i could make a lot of money since I remember before him all my other dealers were sketchy as hell and junkies who will sometime tax on the product or just be a waster of timeeeee. 

This guy told me he wants to just deal with me and if anybody I known who wants them that I would have to be the middle man and only way they'd get them is if they go through me. So today was my gfs birthday and I'm broke as hell I wasn't able to get her everything  wanted and just feel like shit about it. My brother let me get some money and I ended up getting some so I wasn't sick while with her. When I'm sick it usually only last 3 days or so because my tolerance is pretty low compared to some of the people on here. Anyway I told her I'd make up to her and that I couldn't until I get paid. I'm just glad i got her a present. I told her i was broke because I let a friend borrow a lot of money and he didn't pay me back yet. I actually spent the money on drugs.

Anyway I need some advice.. Should I take my chance and use my connect to keep my friends  from getting sick and making some money while at it. Or could this be the beginning of something terrible because ill always have pills available. One of the reasons chilling before was super easy because my other connect wasn't reliable. I'm sorry if this is a confusing long post and maybe with bad grammar since I'm high as hell right now.  If i do decide to deal and pointers for me ? If not what are your opinions? 
I'd also like to point out that I used to be a gym freak but ever since pills that's what's become my priority and I'm unhappy with how my life's changed. Taking the pills temporarily makes me forget that and makes everything in my life seen okay. Especially since I'm completely nicer and show a lot more love to my girkdfriend.

About a week ago, I came across a boatload of 10mg methadone tablets (about 50 of them) for dirt cheap.  So far, these have proven a bit tricky to get the hang of.  I've only ever used these (methadone) while chipping, meaning I'd pop 3 or 4 or 5 in a single dose whenever they were around; When doing them this way, it's a great high with great legs, then you come down slowly.

I never really had a stash of them like I do now.  For the first two days, I took 4 in the morning, three in the afternoon (70mg total).  Great at first, but I began to realize I was getting more fucked up each day without getting as much of the ""fun"" high out of it-- when I took my dose in the afternoon of the second day, it got me too fucked up to do normal tasks, and my girlfriend kept saying I looked tired, was squinting / closing my eyes while trying to do normal tasks like watching TV, cooking, etc..  It was way too obvious that I was fucked up (she doesn't know I use). I didn't like it because I couldn't drive or stay awake enough to get stuff done-- it would have been alright if all I wanted to do was be a couch potato and nod off continuously, but that's not really my style.  I prefer the energetic, motivated type euphoria (like oxys) that keeps me up doing things.

Day 3 & 4, I only did 4 in the afternoon (40mg total per day) and it's a cleaner, lighter high now, meaning I can still do stuff without a continuous nod, but I still get that sleepy-tired, zoning out nod at times.  But worse, there's no noticeable rush or come-up.  I just get a slight bit more energetic, elevated mood for a couple hours, followed by sedation and more nodiness.

For example, last night when I was going to bed with the gf, I nodded out and started day-dreaming, a continuation of what I was experiencing at the moment; when I snap out of the nod, I was still halfway in the dream, and this caused me to start to say random shit 
and then I forgot what I was talking about and was confused as hell.  She's startled by this and shouts, ""That's it, you need to get more sleep!!!""

I've never really experienced this type of heavy sedation with other opiates, and not sure how I should adjust my dosage (amount or frequency) to get some usefulness, or heavy euphoria out of this drug-- without nodding my balls off or giving it away that I'm high.

TL;DR:  Got 50 10mg methadone tablets.  Have to take 6-7 throughout the day to get any significant euphoria from them.  But I get way too sedated by day 2 or 3 and begin to nod-out at work and at home, which pisses off my girlfriend (who doesn't know I use).  Tried taking fewer tablets in a day which resulted in a cleaner feeling high with less sedation, but substantially less euphoria.  Looking for suggestions on how to maximize the euphoria, while keeping the side effects (drowsiness, nodding) tolerable.",1416949081.0

Some of it of course, but i was supposed to make it last. I got around 8500 dollars and once my tuition, books and other miscellaneous items were paid for i was left with around 5000$. Day after day i watched that amount get lower and lower, and day after day i told myself once i got to X amount of money i would have to stop, get some subs and try to quit. But everytime i got to my limit (started at 3000, then 2000 and so on) i would somehow justify it to myself that it was ""ok"" to keep going because i still had 2000 dollars left right? That will be enough once i quit. Well now i am down to my last 100 dollars, its only november and im basically fucked for the next 2 months.. I will receive additional funding in january (about 3000$) however i really dont want to do the same thing with that, and i dont know how to explain to my parents or anyone that i am already broke again.. i basically am forced to quit now as i have no other source of income at the moment which is probably a good thing, however i am worried once i receive my other money i will just do the same with that..

2nkjiw,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2nkjiw/subutex_clinics_and_pharmacies/,8,https://redd.it/2nkjiw,Kat-E-Purry,Subutex Clinics and Pharmacies,"Hello r/opiates,

I have been going to a suboxone clinic since August and have received a prescription for 28 subutex bi-weekly. This clinic also has a pharmacy attached, so you walk out of one door after the doctor visit/therapy and into another to get your prescription. Its convenient, and makes life easy on everyone. It's been a very smooth system until tonight.

I left the pharmacy after picking up my prescription, got in my car and opened my bottle to double check that I had 28 pills. I always count before I leave for peace of mind that I'll have enough to last me until my next visit. I have always had exactly 28 pills until tonight, when I was shorted one.

I looked all over the car, thinking I must have dropped it. No. There was nothing. I walked back inside, kicking myself in the ass for not counting inside the pharmacy, but considering I've never had a problem, it didn't seem necessary. 

The pharmacist flipped out on me and  told me it was ""pretty fucked up"" that I counted my pills after I got them and that ""they NEVER make mistakes"". I was told that he would give me another one out of ""laziness"" but if he had done a count he would be short. He insinuated that if it happened again, I would be out of the program.

I was an emotional wreck on my way home. Most clinics around here have a long wait list and I waited 6 months on one before I found this clinic which had openings. I realize the stigma addicts have and that their first instinct is that I am trying to get one over on them but I am just trying to cover my ass. 

I did some research online after I got home and found out that people get shorted all the time. I learned that its best to count your prescription as soon as they hand it to you at the counter because after you leave, you're no longer their responsibility. I plan on counting them at the counter from now on, but I am worried about how the pharmacist reacted when I told him I did that; as if he was offended that I doubted him or something. 

So my question is, can they kick me out of the suboxone program for counting my script inside? I could have lost the missing sub, or one of the technicians could have made a mistake or pocketed it. Im humiliated about the way I was treated tonight and I never want that to happen again. The doctor and pharmacist are partners so going to another pharmacy isnt an option. I have always passed my urine tests and I take my subs like they a prescribed to me. I just didn't want to run out before my next visit and piss negative or something. I hope someone here can shed some light on this situation an help me feel more at ease. I do not want to get thrown on the street to go on another wait list just because I want to cover my ass.

Thank you to anyone/everyone who took the time to read this. I had so much weighing on my mind that I kind of got carried away.",1417086430.0

Do you prefer rock hard dope or soft dope? Sometimes I get dark brown, rock hard chunks of dope, and other times I get a beige-ish color soft dope that is more powderish.

I've never noticed a consistent difference in quality from either one. In my area, sometimes the rocks are the best, and sometimes the powder is better.

Since I only sniff my dope, I actually prefer the more powderish dope as it's easier to cut into lines. Also, I've had rock dope fly across the room while crushing it up, never to be found again. However, I will purposely seek out the rock hard stuff if one of my homies tells me a particular batch that is fire.

I've never done tar since I'm on the East Coast but I've noticed over the years ECP is usually one of these two types: rock or powder.

I was patiently waiting to get home to do  my last shot and wait for my brother to get out of work about 12 hours from then. Finally out of work and I'm on my way home snow is coming down really heavy now and people are driving slower than death I start to feel better knowing that I have rigfilled with happiness in my drawer at home. After the 15 minute drive turned into a one hour trip home I just sit down shut up and shoot up its the last and im already contemplating how I'm going to get high again and how miserable it's going to be waiting till 2 a.m. For my brother to get home from work and  so we can make the hour long trip to score. 45 minutes later I get a call from my brother his boss is sending everyone home because of the weather, we might just be in luck after all as I sit waiting for him to turn up at home to pick me up for the normal 40 minute ride turned into a 90 minute ride for him  home. I Sprint to the car and it's  snowing like there's no tomorrow there's probably close to 4 inches of snow on the ground it's climbing quickly.. we already know that this is going to turn into quite the journey. the snow is exceptionally heavy and it's forcing the tree branches to fold over under the weight of the snow. Since we're living out in the boonies right now tree branchs are all over the roads we have to continue to get out to move them to carry on our journey. finally hit the main road and we start cruising along a high rate of speed of 35 miles an hour we're already not looking forward to this trip as everyone in New Hampshire seems to be driving like they've never seen snow. Great.before we make it to the highway which normally speaking  is the longest  yet fastest  part of our daily journey. today is going to be a little different though with at least 4 inches of unplowed snow on the road it looks like a barren wasteland on top of a car cemetery and the people are driving as if they were zombies slowly driving down the four lane highway, we aggressively weave through cars at a top speed of 40 miles an hour. now we're not driving in an all wheel drive or 4 wheel drive vehicle we happen to be cruising any early ninety's Saturn station wagon not built for its maneuvering capabilities yet we're going to put this car to the test today.  dodging left and right to avoid the spun out cars sunk up to their door handle and thick wet heavy snow we realize that this trip which normally takes about 40 minutes has already lasted an hour and 20 minutes as we slowed to an unbearable 15 miles per hour due to an accident . we finally see our exit drive  practically sideways  down the off ramp we finally slide to a stop and continue the last 2 miles at a reasonable pace not really caring if we got stuck or not at this point. my brother slams the car into a 4 foot tall mound of snow in front of our dealers house. excitedly we rushed up the stairs and place our order and within 5 minutes we have what we have made this horrible trip 4 right after injecting ourself with the warm brown substance that we crave so badly my phone beeps looking down I see one new Facebook message from the one and only heroin king. after a few brief messages relaying our position in relation to his we head out across town to meet the king himself. After a fun yet brief visit we once again head out into the dark unknown to make our return trip home and that is where the story finds us dear readers as my brother tries to navigate this frozen wasteland that used to want to be known as a highway and myself dictating this post to my phone we can only hope that we can finally make it back and complete our journey stay safe and happy nods ps fuck the powers out",1417064153.0

She wasn't worried about changing her clothes to get that smell off. She just needed to get high. Now. After six flights of stairs, she was at her door fumbling with her keys. And after what felt like an eternity, she was finally inside.
It was a shithole. No ones ideal apartment by any means, but it was a dry, semi-warm place with a mattress on the floor under a row of windows that looked down onto an ever busy street, and a toilet that never stopped running. She dropped her tattered, over sized bag and keys on the floor and quickly made her way over to the bare, very stained bed. Everything she needed was within reach, for she had donr this many times before. A bent spoon lay on the bed in front of her while she reached into the left cup of her bra to grab the small piece of folded up paper. To the untrained eye, it wasnt anything; a gum wrapper, trash. But to her, to a junkie, it was everything.
As carefully as her shaking hands would allow, she unfolded the paper and dumped its contents into the spoon. She added water and stirred. Try as she might, she couldnt keep the images of what she had done to get tge drugs out of her head. She was well used to doing what she had to, to get high, but she hated herself for this. Whatever. It was over and she got what she wanted. It was time to reap the rewards. Thuroughly mixed, she picked her syringe up off the floor and drew up the brown liquid. It didnt look like enough; it never does.
She wrapped an old shoelace around her arm, a couple inches above the crook. She held the long end in her mouth and pulled tight. Her veins didn't bulge like they used to, but with years of practice under her belt, she knew where to stick herself. And like any junkie, she had track marks. Scars there only to remind her of all the wasted money, all the heartache she put herself through and all the shame she caused her family. But none of that mattered right now. Nothing else mattered. She needed to feel better. Actually, she needed to feel nothing at all. Focusing on her arm, she pierced her skin. It didnt hurt; she was used to the pain by now.
If only it were as simple as stabbing yourself... She pulled back on the plunger of the syringe to see if she was in a vein, blood would fill the barrel. But blood didnt mix with the liquid- she needed to do some poking and proding. 
""Fuck."" She could feel the frustration building inside her. On top of already feeling ashamed for what she had done to get the drugs, she was now pissed at herself for not being able to hit quickly. Getting mad wasnt going to solve anything. Taking the needle out, she pulled the shoelace tighter.
""Come on"" she whispered to herself. She poked herself again and pulled back on the plunger. This time, her blood ran into the syringe and a sly smile creeped across her face. Wasting no time, she pushed down on the plastic plunger. She dropped the shoelace from her mouth, loosened it from her arm and let out a sigh of relief. Time to lie back and ride tge wave. Pulling the needle out of her arm, she dropped it to the floor.
The rush is what she fell in love with so long ago. It's something you can't find anywhere else; essentially a feeling of acceptance, understanding, fulfillment, satisfaction. All the shit she put herself through this morning was well worth it. And as much as she wanted to believe that she would never stoop that low again, it was inevitable. It would happen again. And again. It really was easy money.

a ""water shot"" is self-explanatory, but i used to hear stories about how shooting water can give you a heart attack, an aneurysm, etc etc... i was very young though, and i know they give IV saline to people, and often whatever substance i'm shooting contains near-homeopathic levels of actual drug. so how different can it be aside from sterility? i feel like shooting cold water would give enough of a sensation to add some kind of placebo effect too. maybe i'm wrong. but it would be nice if it did.  
 
how often is too often? because i'm mostly ok with not being high (not counting dopesicknes...), but i miss shooting things more than anything else. for fuck's sake, i shot a seroquel a long time ago when i was sober because i was going to take it anyway, and i thought FUCK THIS, PUT IT IN MY ARM! HA HA!  
  
well, that was awful. but point being. what are the risks of water shots if i end up doing like 2 or 3 a day? i swear to god, i have to wean off the act of slamming things by itself even...  
  
{update} thanks for the thoughts, people. i'm kinda wary of it for a few reasons, but it sounds like it's perfectly fine if i find myself having a real bad time of it, wanting to use. it might help a lot to go through the motions.",1417042294.0

But it was kinda tough to push in, and as I got about halfway through it started to burn, which was weird, being as I hadn't moved my hand or my rig at all.  So I re registered and continued, assuming the burn was cuz I had pierced some scar tissue from like the first or second time I banged, which of course,I fucked up real hard at the time. My hand got super hot n real red and burned a lot. I still got a pretty strong rush, but that was ruined as I ran to get an ice pack and call someone about it.
        It's been like 25 minutes. I iced it for around ten and I'm about too get in the tub and start soaking it.

First post so I thought I might give a bit of history.

3 Years ago I was heavily using Roxy's daily.  I can't even remember how many, but the cost weekly was thousands.  I could afford it, ran a very profitable business and just kept going until the tolerance was so high I was just maintaining.

I think ive always been an addict.  Finding a way to get pain medication, getting surgery on my tonsils to get pain meds(i did need them removed but it could have waited).  The surgery turned into complications which kept me on pain killers for over a month.

The doctor cut me off after they healed, no tapering at all.  So my then business partner knew a guy with Roxy 30's for cheap.  Scored consistently until my partner tried to cut me off.  He too had an issue and still does(we no longer talk).  So I turned to the web, found some legit people(before the darknets).

I then just couldn't keep up anymore.  I called docs in my area about suboxone.  I know long term it will be tough to stop them but I needed help, my family(wife and son) were hanging in the balance(I was only 25 at the time).

I started at 16mg!  My doctor would make me come so frequently, he would check my heart rate and send me along charging me cash.  Im down to 4mg now.

I realized my use of opiates was to dull pains I had in my life, but I also just enjoyed the shit out of them.

A trick to those who use suboxone.  I will dose down to 2mg for a few days and then dose 8mg.  It will hit you pretty nice with a pretty nice body high.

Who was i kidding? I knew it was only a matter of time before i started to get back the mentality of ""bang that shit.""  

I've overcome so much.  From being homeless in manhattan for 2+years, on 110mg of methadone, 8 sticks a day habit of xanax. To getting a job, getting my liscence back and a car,  basically getting back on my feet. I actually had some clean time as well (around 6 months of total abstinence.  Problem was, i was soo fucking bored.  Yeah life got better on the outside, but i was just soo fuckin bored and unfulfilled. I went to A.A./N.A. and met a ton of good people.. and started doing he steps with a sponsor... but all they do is go to like 2-3 meetings a day, get starbucks, and maybe go to the diner...
Don't get me wrong, i did have some fun while sober, and made new honest friends. But after a while these people tend to forget where they came from and start to judge people after they get some clean time

So there i was, bored, knowing basically whats going to happen before it does. My life was basically the movie groundhog day.. i needed some excitement in my life, an adventure of.some sorts. So i startd to go to some bars, meet women..( thats another thing about meeting guys with guys and girls wth the girls) then ended up doing some blow one night, asked around for some pills and came across some crackhead who gets 120 15mg roxies...since they arent his d.o.c . Get them from him for like 9$ a pop

I start doin them maybe every other weekend( i couldnt believe how 30mg hit me!!) Fast forward 5 months later i am now banging 4 of em at once..prob twice or 3 times a day....
The worst part is ive been still going to the meetings to keep up the ""im still sober"" life, and let me tell u... its fucking exhausting livng this double life...

I know i need to choose which life i want to live..

I've never bought # 3 tho it seems the 'kids' I used to buy off finally have some-U'd like to get it someday just so I didn't feel like I was wasting #4 cause I like smoking dope. 


I pay $80 for solid chunks or a collection of chunks of dope that seems really, really nice. wayyyy better than the stuff those 'kids' were getting me which was always powder. I'd like some brown from them if it would save me 20$ and give me something to smoke tho.

.3 for $50, a point for $20

I can't wait to buy from the dark web, I've seen grams of #3 advertised for $50 ~!!!! and fucking grams of #4 going for 80$! literally half of what I'm paying. 

kills me when I see some folks here talking about $60 grams, then I wonder how good it is, but who knows..except for those guys getting it. 

can't wait for my tax return, I think Crypto-coins are interesting but that has little to do with why I picked the name I did, and tho the tech is cool bitcoin is just the first really popular coin, I'm not really excited about bitcoin, but I sure as fuck can't wait to use some on the darkweb to buy dope~!!!

<><><>
ok, so i call the same number that a crew of guys pass around, and the new guyJosh(new guy)-or who i thought was Josh tells me to call back in ten minutes, twice. I finally am ready to meet him and I get such a nasty attitude ""you don't know where the seat place is, fuck, how long have you lived in this fucking town, holy fuck it's not rocket science"" then it seems like he switches with someone else and I'm told ""meet at the corner of X & X. So I go there and stand in the rain for ten minutes...maybe 20.

Come home and ask what's up ""didn't you see the cop"" 

""no, i watched quite a few cop cars pass but I didn't see any cops""
so we talk back and forth and I'll leave out a few pointless details in the interest of a crisp story... so it turns out they thought I looked like a fucking cop.

at one point the guy hangs up. call him back and I'm told shit like ""you were just standing on the corner there, like a fucking dork, and my buddy thought you were a cop.. do you understand me"" seems like he's been drinking and his talk with me is peppered with shit like ""oh my fucking god man, I'm going to knock you out... you're talking to me like I'm an idiot...holy fuck how long have you lived in this town you don't know the streets"".

So we agree to meet at another place, and he's telling me to get there by going thru this dark little forest path I haven't been thru in so fucking long and he tells me they're ""doing construction and it's all cleared out, I'm just telling you cause it's like the fucking fastest way for you to walk here, fuck""

I meet them on the corner and he fucking points from the window like walk thru the intersection, i do..they've turned into a complex, so i get out and stand behind him as he gets out of the passenger side, now he's fucking mad I've followed him and lightly hits me in the back. ""what the fuck man don't follow me"" then he takes me on a walk down the street to tell me "" your number wasn't recognized it comes up as unknown"" so I tell him that T and K kniw me well I've been picking up off them for a long time. ""Who? T? T is a fucking goof, he was working for what, like a fucking week, fuck T. ***WHAM*** annnd now I can smell the booze, it now becomes clear he's been drinking and probably smoking crack- the only other thing they sell besides down. And I tell him well ""K is the guy i know best, I've been buying off him for a long time, he's great, he's always fast, he's friendly""

and he tells me K is a great guy etc etc. I had told them earlier on the phone IDK why he's being so hostile and he tells me he can look at me and is sure I'm not a cop but ""you're sitting there with your fucking headphones on like a dork, wearing a blue cap and blue jacket, my buddy got scared, you know like you've got a fucking headset or some shit *** let me see the fucking money***"" so i flash it and I don't show it long enough and he wants to see it again and I explain to him that after being threatened I'm a little nervous, so i don't want to give it up until it's time. I also tell him I understand why he was nervous if he didn't know my number. *** ""I'm NOT FUCKING NERVOUS"" *** OK, well cautious? 

He finally asks me what I want and it looks like he's about to give me three points so i make sure he's got something bigger but he's still unsure of what I want even after all this back and forth on the phone about the fact I'm looking for a half gram. he was still under the impression i wanted a fuck .3 bag.

So at the bottom of his smoke pack, he's got a half gram for me, one solid piece, which i like, but I'm like ""what's this? oh...it's just not in a bag"" so i walk home with a fucking loose chunk of great dope in my pocket feeling two things...

A. Deal with K and not anyone else if possible.
B. when my fat tax return comes buy some bitcoins and then see how long it takes to ship dope to my place regularly,
C. take a fucking break and cut my use way back for about a week, doing some codeine to avoid any serious WD

You might be thinking, why even go meet him? on the way I thought I'm going to pass this intersection and if he's not here I am just going to turn around and go home and call for the next couple of days until it's K's turn to work again. 

These guys -fucking street goons- get free drugs and some cash for based on how much they sell, and here i am a good customer being told I'm retarded and ""how fucking long have you lived in this town!!"" ""it's not rocket science""..and accused of acting like I'm trying to imply he's stupid? turns out he's drunk and just needlessly aggressive. As we part ways-funny he was trying to be cautious and his buddy thought I was a cop? SMOKE CRACK,MUCH?- but he fucking hands me the dope in the wide open in his fucking complex talking about how he's tired and just wants to go to bed, loudly... and he says almost as though he's trying to be nice ""I'll punch you in buddy, what's your name"" like the fact the phone said unknown was the problem, not the fact he was drunk, aggressive and rude. 

I was fucking high while dealing with him, but i was calm and polite, why didn't i rush out the door to a place I was unsure of? cause if i rush down there and don't know where I'm going I waste his time and mine. 

Now that I know his name I can maybe try to avoid him or always buy less when i reach him. Wish i could just be sure of when K is the runner but they just pass that fucking phone around so I never know who I'm getting.

The guy he called a goof? Super nice guy, meets me, does the exchange in the car, drives me back to my place and makes small talk. Fucking wish it was T I was meeting. I was so close to just walking back home while i was walking there, I'm not dope sick or anything and I know I need a break, that's why I'm extracting some codeine. it just amazes me how fucking rude and fucking entitled some people can be. 

""I didn't know you were the boss or something""

2nn0hs,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2nn0hs/new_and_improved_method_of_rinsing_cottons/,17,https://redd.it/2nn0hs,sxrvy,New and improved method of rinsing cottons.,"I apologize for the length of this post but hopefully others will find this as useful as I do.

This is a new method for rinsing cottons that I discovered today and find more sanitary, less wasteful, and I feel from experience that the high is cleaner/more intense.

Typically when rinsing cottons you'll put some cottons in your vessel with some water and you'll use your plunger to press and stomp the cottons. Then you'll stir, and do it again and again. Finally when you're done, you'll push all the cottons to one side of the cooker and try to use your plunger to get as much liquid as you can out of the cottons. Then you'll pick up the cottons with your hands and try to wring/squeeze the rest out into the rest of the rinse. This last part where you use your hands to wring/press with your fingers typically results in a fairly large loss of fluid volume, as well as introducing new bacteria from your filthy nasty booger hands, like there isn't enough already. Then depending on how many cottons you have, you might repeat this process 5+ times, each time losing volume (and by that logic whatever drug is in the liquid) and adding more bacteria.

My method is very similar but cleaner, retains more volume,  and once heated and filtered, has a noticeably better high, with basically no extra work.

Today I took a really tiny piece of dope I had left (about 0.04 bth), cooked it down, and added all the cottons I had left (about 15), and some water, and mixed and mashed til I was ready. Then I squashed all the cottons with the plastic end of the plunger, draining the liquid into a 2nd cooker as I went, preventing my dirty dopesick hands from ever touching the cottons and introducing new bacteria. Then I stirred the now dry cottons and did it again and again until they were bone dry, occasionally draining more liquid into the 2nd cooker as I went. Then I heated the rinse which is now in the 2nd cooker before filtering it with a  clean cotton and squirting half in cooker A and kept half in cooker b. Then, I filtered the liquid from each cooker again with clean cottons before putting the liquid from each cookeri Into its own clean rig. I actually got super high from it and it wasn't all dirty like a normal rinse. Just 140 total units of dark, filtered, and cleaned rinse. 

This is the first time I've used this method, which I sort of improvised on the fly because I was sick of feeling half my rinse run down my hands and arms when I tried to wring the cottons by hand. I was also able to rinse all of my cottons at once because as I pressed the cottons dry, the liquid drained into the other cooker, rather than just getting the cottons wet again. By the time I was done pressing the cottons while they drained into the 2nd cooker, they were white as if they'd never been used and bone dry, which never happens (for me at least) when I do it the normal way.

I could definitely tell the difference between the high I would've gotten from a similarly sized rinse prepared ""traditionally"". I got very high and even caught a decent nod which never happens from a ""normal"" rinse. I think a part of the reason is that most of the cut stays in the first cooker if you're careful and all you get in cooker number 2 is the active stuff you actually want",1417148874.0

So, like the title says, what's one to do when they're not ready to quit but life circumstances simply do not permit sustaining a habit?

I'll try sparing everyone a long story and just mention that I was doing dope for 3 years before getting caught at home and being forced into a variety of programs. I'm extremely lucky to have insurance so I'm getting IOP paid for as well as a Rx for subs each month, with a minimal copay of $10. Yes, I realize that recovery is being handed to me on a silver platter. I can almost picture a bird chewing food for its infants and placing it in their mouths. 

Yes, it's that simple for me, and yes, I know I'm being pampered through this, but the toughest fucking part is that I just don't feel like quitting. 

I'm having a really difficult time letting go of how much I just love being high, for reasons I'm sure I don't have to detail for all of you. It's obviously lead to countless relapses. Hell, when you're using more than you're clean, I don't think one can even call them relapses. 

So, I still love getting high, thnk about it all the time, but I realize that using only leads to bad things happening in my life. I'm hurting those around me, and that, in turn, DESTROYS me inside. I ruined thanksgiving dinner by getting caught in a web of lies trying to cover up a relapse. It fucking sucks. I've lost well-paying jobs over this shit, I've only recently been hired elsewhere and my life is somewhat picking up but all the debt i've incurred, all the lies I've told, all the hurt I've inflicted, the trust I've lost, none of it has seemed to be enough to deter me from wanting to get high. 

I WANT to stop using, for the simple fact that I want to stop hurting my family and pick my life up, but I also WANT to get really fucking high, really fucking badly, and really fucking soon. 

I guess, in a perfect world, if i could have it my way I'd be using and my family would not know about it, and my job would be performed without troubles. But I know this isn't the case.

So, I'd assume(or hope) that some of you have had a similar experience. So, r/opiates, what to do when you want to stop but still have a burning fucking desire to get high? Greatly appreciate any advice that's thrown my way, this shit is really hard.

***Where do you get your supplies? Do you have to buy them?does your state/province etc supply anything, even just clean needles?*** (i hope we can start getting free Narcan.

***I've always read about going in on an angle rather than straight down so that you can get inside the vein and not pierce both sides- but I find it much easier to fo straight down but keep it shallow..at least in the pit of my elbow, I tried hitting on my upper arm up near my wrist, and even with a huuuuge puffy vein and going in on an angle i kept managing to fuck it up, i just couldn't draw blood, plus it was really painful)-and no it wasn't leading to an artery or leading right into one it was small and also didn't pulse.*** I don't want to try hitting my legs any time soon, I wish i was better with my arms but so far using the pit of my elbow is just the easiest thing for me, I've seen people hitting on the top-side of their arm above the elbow and I'm thinking wtf.. i hope I don't have to try these hard angles any day soon. I bet my legs would be easy but I was reading something on Heroin Helper about the order of preference, the places you should want to hit first. 

***Where do you get your water if not from the little units I get, I just ran out of them and it's the weekend, I figure I'll be using tap water and that I'll have to pour it into my cooker from a really clean glass or something? tho I worry about even a trace of dishsoap or some shit making it into my system. So long as they're going to supply the little water units I've been getting I'm going to stock up on those every time I get supplies***

***
Lastly, another thing I hear is leave the tourniquet on until you get the needle inside- THEN JUST BEFORE YOU INJECT TAKE IT OFF, and I know leaving it on can cause a burst vein but I've been taking it off just before push the needle in, cause I don't have three fucking hands and imho leaving the needle in while I loosen a tourniquet is super tricky not to mention the fact the needle is all over the place and might loose it's place or go to town on the inside of my veins with that sharp point. 

How the fuck are people managing that? surely I can't be the only one that makes it really tight and then takes it off just before pushing the needle into a vein instead of just before pushing down the plunger. *** the trail and error sure is fun tho. so long as the needle has a nice bitter liquid inside I've had lots of fun learning about my body and the sweet sweet nectar of nearly instantaneous opioid effects. 

So, I'm so 'spoiled' here in Western Canada that even my water comes in little water units-(they say ***""NOT FOR INJECTION""*** whihch to me is really funny simply because one government agency make 'em, another goverment agency used to give them out my my area for injection-the ""Fraser Health Authority""- and now that government agency has dropped the responsibility and lets a small private group(that I'm sure get some government money) handle it all. But remember, ***""NOT FOR INJECTION""*** -THE BUREAUCRACY HAS SPOKEN~!!! lulz


 but I'm new to this so it's been tricky figuring out how much i need and how much dope/water i can cram into a full cc and a half cc syringe. using the syringe to measure the water has been helpful but I always end ujp with some left over in the unit and in the case of the half cc sometimes I feel i should be mixing up two syringes..but when i cram all the dope into one it's stronger and so on.

First couple of days I tried this all my shots were pretty weak just to be on the safe side. at this point-not even 5 days into this I love seeing that burst of blood that shows me I'm in and pushing the plunger down nice and slow. Some might find it morbid or 'trashy' or even scary but I really, really love seeing that burst of blood. I've never cut myself and I've never self harmed in any way..I've been suicidal before and depressed but I don't see that blood as a negative thing, it's like the go light for the hedonism express. it bursts forth into the barrel and it's like ALL SYSTEMS GO and I push the plunger down and all the magical liquid blasts into my circulatory system. FUCK YEAH.

He ignored my advice on not doing it tried it for the first time tonight. I think he took $80 worth (in northeast ohio) He was okay initially after snorting it, for about 15 minutes. Then he passed out, his breathing slowed DRASTICALLY (5 breaths per minute), his heart rate became very shallow, his pupils were pinned, he was completely unresponsive. I even gave him mouth to mouth (no compressions but breathed out and felt his longs inflate) and he didn't respond whatsoever and his eyes opened shortly after that for a short while ,he looked dead. I ran downstairs to get help and when I got back I saw him take a breath. And I rolled him over on his side and his eyes closed again. He was breathing about once every 15 seconds. I called an ambulance and he woke up and was responding when they left for the hospital and hes spending the night in er tonight.


Anyways my questions, is that something that would be normal?  I hqve no experience with this. Do you think he was possibly dead for those few seconds while his eyes were open?

Most recently IV dope. The past couple months I've been on subs and starting to feel somewhat normal.

Every relationship in the past 5 years has been a joke because all my girlfriends have used with me and that just took all the awkwardness out of the situation.

So I've been talking to a girl lately....she's a good girl. Never touched drugs and has only been drunk like once. But she's pretty bangin. And tonight I'm taking her on a date. For fucks sake I have never been so nervous for a date in my life. But it will only get easier from here and a girlfriend is exactly what I need to keep off the skag.

If you don't want to read it I understand, sometimes I come here just for the pics, or to see what people are scoring, but I do enjoy reading about what folks are up to sometimes too, 
>Estimated reading time: 8 minutes, 
You've been warned, So Please don't be a dick about this thread.. 
read it or don't read it, it's up to you, I wont be upset if you skip it. 

So I'm new to iv'in and I loaded myself a strong shot- really strong for me... strongest and darkest one I've ever had, and holy fuck was it awesome, but it hit me so fucking hard that i dialed 91-and waited thinking I may have overshit things. then i hit one after doing this a few times and thought-FUCK I SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT. So i call back and tell them not to waste their resources on me, don't come out, and the operator gets me talking..about my divorce..my health..my psyche...

and being a foold I'm lured in and talk about my life. I told her more than once not to send any cops but she assures me ""I'm not a cop I'm just an RCMP operator""

after a nice chat suddenly the fucking cops are at my door! No~!! WTF!! So they come in -and of course they have to come in one day before I clean up my place- and they immediately start looking around for people ""anyone else in here"" and ask about a ""relationship issue"", that fucking operator told them everything but the info isn't perfect. 

I assure them I'm fine and I don't need them here I just slammed more than I maybe should have-actually it was perfect it was so fucking good it's just that the rush was so strong and I'm really not used to something that fast and intense, and you know what that it freaked me out a bit. plus this is a new batch, for weeks it's been the same shit but this stuff is way whiter and smells a little like vinegar. it's actually really, really pretty. 

So the cops claim the ambulance guys are coming and I tell them over and over I don't need them...it's a waste of resources, I tell them I'm sorry and I am very polite with them and they explain I don't have to go to the hospital ""great, I'm not going, I don't need an assement either I feel fine, it was just a strong rush""

Get this,...You know what really pisses me off, they fucking walk around my place and I swear they were looking for drugs, at one point they tell me not to walk around cause it's ""an officer safety issue"" and I look right at the cop, open the fridge back up and say, I have to put my bacon away, and show him a pan of uncooked bacon that I was about to fry. it's nothing really but it was an odd moment ...sitting there telling the cop about bacon. heh. 

anyway,...they kept eying my tables and my desk with my computer and supplies, and they'e scanning back and forth over and over so I'm thinking ***fuck they're going to take my half gram!!! ***so i keep telling them ""yeah it was just a bit much, ***I took everything I had left and *did it all* ***. 

i kept accentuating the lie, claiming i did all that i had left. all the while they're scanning my shit.

Also, at one point the female cop goes ""there's needles everywhere"" ,,,meanwhile there's ONE NEEDLE-count 'em-ONE, capped, and a sharps container filled with used needles. bitch was acting like my floor-admittedly messy-was covered with needles. 

Anyway, so the paramedics arrive and I beg them to leave the building cause it used to be a seniors only building and everyone in it is so fucking old and nosey, so i go to sit in the back of the ambulance and the paramedic is trying to assure me that he's my buddy and I have nothing to worry about and I tell him ""I have nothing against you guys, I'm wayyyy calmer around you ..having the cops in my place looking around at my home for things to seize it what freaked me out""

***and he goes ""yeah, they're such nosey fucks!""... ""they always want to look into everyone's personal business"" ***

""Sure we work alongside them but we're on the other side of the law""

""That's why I feel calm around you guys, i mean what kind of dick do you have to be to hate the paramedics""

So he checks my vitals, everything is fine, we chat about life goals and shit and he tells me to be careful if I'm going to use cause it wasn't too long ago that a fentanyl cut batch was all over the place, and that batch to batch ""you'll sometimes find one that will knock you right on your ass when you don't expect it"" Suddenly the male cop opens the door, and I ask him to shut it, he glares at me and the paramedic tells him to shut the door to not let the heat out. 

So the cop gets in and the paramedic says I'm fine but shouldn't hessitate to call if I do more or if I ever get into trouble od wise. We then talk about how I'm trying to find more than temp work and how I had a  brutal divorce, how I want to get lithium and how I was on an anti-depressent but quit it after getting thru being suicidal and feeling that I didn't need it anymore. 

The paramedic was decent and told me that maybe it was time to give up heroin-nope- but that's no one's choice accept mine. told me I obviously have a sharp mind and if I can rattle on about brain chemistry I should be espectially careful with my own and make sure I'm on the right track, and if I do use just be very careful about how I use and aware of how strong the batch of heroin is...

Cop chimes in ""is dialing 9-1- and waiting to see if you're going to die how you want to live your life?"" And you know what, he's right. but it's like I told them, it's a pressure release valve for me and even if I know I wont be getting really high till Saturday or Sunday it makes the week leading up to that so much easier, I likle being able to alter my mood so significantly. 

Of course I didn't tell them about small CWE's and how I use codeine to get away with using enough dope to cause significant WD without codeine, that's one amazing thing about living in Canada, I don't have to go thru wd. there's always a 200 pill bottle of codeine waiting for me for the low price of $9.50

It was an awkward time,  but no major 'wake up call' sure they think I'm a chipper but I'm a pretty regular user and it's going to stay that way, I fucking love heroin and I'm going to go to school to become a lab tech and soon I'm going to get more than temp work jobs or my job at the pot farm every two weeks... I have lots of plans and brutal divorce or not I'm going to move forward with life, I'm even going to pick my guitar back up and grow tons and tons of mushrooms again... but I'm still going to be in love with everything from the opium poppy. 

Some people like wine, I used to be really into pot..until it just made me feel weird and edgy, opioids are the drugs I like to do, I think it's time for a break in early December but I'm going to savor this bag I still have and I'd like to buy one more when it runs out, especially cause their new batch is so good. 

I know the fact it smells of vinegar a little doesn't mean it's good, and some people just say that, but a few of my best bags did, and this one is no exception. 

Even the cop wasn't so bad, but I sure as fuck led him away from my place ASAP and the moment I could turn off the living room light without looking suspicious I did.

My dope was sitting in an ear plugs container which was multi-coloured and sitting right below my computers bass sub, they never say it... you can bet your ass if it was sitting in the bright yellow bag it came in they would have seized it, thank fucking junkie Jesus they didn't.

Paramedic asked me a few times if I wanted to go down to the hospital anyway to talk to someone or see if maybe I might want new meds but that I was free to make my own choice, which sounds nice....kinda... but what he doesn't say is that then I have to talk the fucking bus home later and it's freezing cold outside.

I came upstairs , put Drugs Inc back on and took a fat toke of down. 

I spend the fucking best part of my high talking to cops, bleh. 

But the older paramedic was a super cool guy, he even winked at me a few times when the cop was talking to me, and sometimes had this look on his face like..""yeah, ok copper"" and a nice big friendly smile like it's going to be ok, just chill. When I first got in there and the cop came in he looked at the cop and said ""elevated heart beat but that's normal, he's probably a little anxious considering the situation""

I am so fucking happy they didn't get my drugs. I have losts drugs to cops many times, and this time they were right there in front of my shit and looking for it, clearly, but because it was in a container and hidden under my bass sub they didn't take it. mentioning that I literally just blasted ***""all of it""*** into my arm also helped.

The quality isn't like insanely good, but its got a nice rush (i shoot) and some pretty noddy legs.  Anyway I prepped my shot in a fast food private bathroom and put in a little extra as I had shot up a couple times in the past few days and I wanted to get pretty high.  So I mix, filter, register, and shoot.  I'm sitting on the toilet and I feel the rush.  Next thing I know, I awaken with a large ghasping sound laying face down on the floor out of breath.  My whole right leg had lost feeling.  I look at my phone and realize that I have been out for 45 minutes so I hurry and try to throw all my shit away because I thought that there were probably gonna be cops waiting for me cause i was in the bathroom for so long (kept my dope in my mouth when I walked out though of course lol).  The coast was clear, and my leg slowly regained feeling. The ankle and knee are still a bit sore though.  Anyway, I really want to know what happened, because at first I thought I OD'd and could have died.  But then I realized that my lips weren't blue and I had actually woken up so I couldn't have OD'd.  Has this happened to any of you guys? Can someone what it is and if there are any side affects?
