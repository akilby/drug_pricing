on our way back into town i checked my card, and someone fucked up at the plasma center,  so instead of 50 for donating i got 108. not even sure how that happened, i assume they kept trying to load the cards when it wasn't working but idk where the extra 8 came from. don't care. THEN we're at the gas station and my bf finds twenty dollars on the ground. THEN we run into his cousin who we had asked to loan us 20 weeks ago and she asks if we still want it. of course we do!

so, started out today broke and sick. ended up with almost $200 of free dope and enough cash to get me to payday. it's been a while since so much good fortune has bestowed us so i felt compelled to share. fucking full moon, man. i hope some good shit happens to you lovely people too!

FUN!,"The point of telling this story here is as a cautionary tale, and hopefully to get some advice from others who deal with terrible constipation from using dope.

I‚Äôll start the story in the middle... I was using dope for a long time, got off of it by using kratom for a long time, ended up getting back on dope again.. Both of these things cause pretty serious constipation. So I wouldn‚Äôt poop at all for a good week, then a little handful of pebbles once every day or two, that are hard to pass and very unsatisfying.. Months and months and months of this, it sucked, but I didn‚Äôt realize how much shit was building and building up in my colon or intestine or wherever it builds up.. Until one morning I awoke with some pretty nasty stomach pains, so I sat on the toilet and tried to get something out, to no avail, as usual. But the pain would not subside, and it was BAD! I was burping a lot too, and it tasted bad like sulfur, so i KNEW something was extra rotten down there... I switched from fetal position on the floor, to on the toilet trying with all my being to pass ANYTHING!! And the pain was persistent the entire time.. a good 8-9 hours of NONSTOP gut pain. My anus was in a constant state of PUSH. I couldn‚Äôt get it to relax. My butthole was puckered and trying to push, beyond my control, for hours and hours! It was crazy! After a while I was literally screaming from the pain... but NOTHING WOULD COME OUT! During one of my lying on the floor periods, I felt like something might be ready to come out, but since nothing would happen any other times, I figured ‚Äòfuck it‚Äô just keep pushing and let it happen.. so a whole lotta liquid shit stew started erupting all over the place... my legs, the rug, the floor, the walls.... but that was okay.. at least something was coming out... so, this happened maybe 3 more times over the course of a few hours.. and all of those times I was in fetal position on the floor... but still nothing solid, just lots and lots of liquid shit everywhere! Finally, after a period sitting on the toilet, screaming, with the nonstop uncontrollable sphincter pushings going on, a GIGANTIC slightly squished softball sized (literally) DRY sickly looking tumor of nasty dead SHIT passed out and it was INSANE! I can honestly say, it was probably on par with a woman giving birth. About the literal size of a baby‚Äôs head... maybe even bigger..... it was fucking crazy! I weighed 7-8lbs lighter after the whole incident was through.. I felt like i just came back from war. And all i could do was lie there in my mess... Thankfully when my girlfriend came home to find me half naked completely covered in shit, passed out from exhaustion, lying on the bathroom floor, with SHIT EVERYWHERE, she only freaked out a little bit.. and was able to get me cleaned up, clean up the bathroom a little, put me in some clean dry clothes, and get me into the bed. It felt like fucking HEAVEN lying in that bed with that ordeal behind me! I still felt like death, but after literally sleeping through an entire day, and half of the next one, I felt much better. Since that huge fecal compaction was finally passed, and my bowels were clear for the time being, I was even shitting normal for the next few days!

BUT, of course, I kept on using dope like normal, and eventually I‚Äôve become pretty backed up again. I would do ANYTHING to never go through experience again (except stop using drugs of course..) I read that I could‚Äôve even died if it didn‚Äôt pass that day!  So, I‚Äôve been giving myself enemas every couple days, and that‚Äôs gotten some shit to pass a bit. It‚Äôs still mostly little marble sized balls that look bloody and light brown, and certainly not healthy. Definitely not as much as I think should be coming out though.. I‚Äôd love to try the prescription laxative specifically designed for opioid induced constipation called Movantik.. but it seems there‚Äôs no OTC off brand or anything similar out there.. SO, the purpose of me sharing this harrowing tale with you guys, is to serve as a pretty serious cautionary tale as to just how bad it can get, AND to see if anybody has the best of the best advice for getting some real serious bowel movements moving through my bowels!

Hopefully some of you have read this entire ramble of a story. Any help would be awesome. And yes, i know quitting would be the best option, but it just ain‚Äôt gonna happen right now. So, I‚Äôm trying my best. 

TL;DR - Got so constipated and full of shit that my body couldn‚Äôt take it anymore and it HAD to come out! I‚Äôm looking for the best advice for combating opioid induced constipation of the highest order.

First of all, this is my first post ever on Reddit (yay) although I've been on the site for years.

My question may have been asked before but I've searched for an hour and couldn't quite find an answer so I thought I'd give it a go myself.

While reading the text below, keep in mind I have virtually no tolerance to any opiate. 

So a month ago I got hold of a few strips of oxycodone 5 mg IR. I tried 5 mg first; felt nothing. A few days later I took 15 mg and still felt nothing. This afternoon I decided to take 30 mg at once (might've been irresponsible in hindsight, but I figured since 15 didn't do anything, doubling it wouldn't be that extreme). I still felt nothing so took another 20 mg, and when that didn't work either I decided redosing again would be useless. The only effect I felt after the 50 mg dose today was a very very slight nausea.

The same thing happened a year ago when I drank codeine/promethazine with a couple friends: everybody was nodding off and I felt completely sober. 

The above makes me wonder whether it's possible for people to be with an extreme tolerance to opiates/opioids. I'm aware of people whose bodies can't convert codeine to morphine, but does a similar problem exist with oxycodone?

I hope someone who has knowledge of this subject has the time and interest to talk about it with me.

Sorry if my message is a bit awkward and badly written, as I said this is my first post ever so I don't quite know how to write a good Reddit post hahah. Also English isn't my native language so Grammar Nazis please have mercy.

Im on MMT and once 4-5pm comes around im dead tired. (I dose at 5:30am every morning, maybe 6am at the latest.)  
The ol' lady goes to work at 5pm since i work mornings. I have a son who's not even 3 yet so his bed time is still around 7pm so im up with him until he goes to bed. On top of that, sometimes he likes to give me a hassle and just jump around and play in his crib/bed for an hour or two. Anyway...bottom line is i have to make sure im awake until he falls asleep and is safe and soundly asleep.  
When i was just starting methadone, coming off of dope/fent i still had a bunch of rigs left over. So one night i decide ill IV my adderall since theyre IR. I noticed that it instantly hits me as if i had taken it orally. Again, no high involved but it keeps me awake, it also keeps my needle obsession at bay.

Last year I finally washed my hands of a 15 year alcoholism problem and quit drinking. Haven‚Äôt felt the desire to pick up a drink since. 

On Feb 7th of this year I decided I had had enough of drugs. I had a good run on painkillers for 16.5 years. Then, in a year and a half Heroin and Fentynal took everything from me. My apartment, my job, my girl, my relationships, my family, my car, everything. I was homeless, scrounging for money every day, maxed out all my credit cards and spent every last penny I had shooting up. 
So I went in to rehab. Lasted about a week and ran away and immediately relapsed. What followed was a roller coaster of being in and out of treatment for the next couple months. Since February I have been in 9 different treatments. Rehabs, detoxes, recovery houses, etc. and I would either AWOL, AMA, or my insurance would give me the boot. I never completed one. 
Well I finally just finished a five day detox and was able to finally get on methadone. I know that methadone is a very divisive subject, but honestly for me, it‚Äôs been a game changer. I have honestly had no cravings, no desire to use, and no desire to get high since starting on it last week. 
That coming on the heels of the fact that about two weeks ago I overdosed and died, this was the right time to kick the habit. Plus, I never want to go through getting hit with Narcan again. I got hit with two doses by some kids on the street I was using with, which then was followed by one of the worst sixty minute experiences of my life. I had been using heavily, and the instant withdrawal I went in to was absolutely brutal. I was cryshitsweatvomitting everywhere to the point that I thought about just collapsing and giving up and lying in my own filth until someone either called an ambulance or the cops. 
Fortunately I got to a hospital where they let me ride it out until it all passed. I went through probably about 5 days of withdrawal in about 35 minutes and it was terrible. Never again. 

So I‚Äôm currently on 55mg of methadone and we‚Äôve been kicking it up 5mg each day until we find my therapeutic dose. I honestly haven‚Äôt felt ‚Äúhigh‚Äù like the first few times I took methadone, but the cravings and urges have gone away. Which is good because I‚Äôm genuinely afraid of heroin/fent now after dying off it. 

I also may have just found a recovery house that will let me continue maintenance, has a very affordable rent that covers 3 meals a day, will help you find a job, and is close to all sorts of public transit so that I can get around. So fingers crossed that I get in, I should find out by tomorrow at the latest and hopefully can move in on Thursday. 

So it‚Äôs been a fun run, with it‚Äôs ups and downs. I‚Äôve gotten clean plenty of times, and relapsed plenty more. The longest clean time I had ever put together in the past was about a week. I‚Äôm writing this today with **18 days**, and I‚Äôm hoping to really keep this one going this time. For myself mainly, but for the few people I have left who haven‚Äôt given up on me and still give a shit. 
I‚Äôm sure there will be days that I‚Äôll miss it, but at 33 years old with absolutely nothing to show for it, I‚Äôm hoping to finally turn my life around and start living for something more than just the next high. 

Thanks for letting me share!

Tl;dr Started methadone after OD‚Äôing and dying and it‚Äôs been a lifesaver. Haven‚Äôt had urges or cravings, and after tons of relapses and previously only having at most a week of clean time, I currently have 18 days and more hope and confidence then I‚Äôve ever had. But the humble kind of hope and confidence, not the cocky kind that gets me back in trouble. ",1527631803.0

My name is Mitch Weintraub. Born and raised in Burrillville Rhode Island, I called it home for 25 years. Went to Austin T. Leavy and Steere Farm Elementary as a chubby, quiet nerdy kid. Arrived at Burrillville Middle School as a skinny, long haired, loud punk nicknamed ‚ÄúRingo,‚Äù and graduated from Burrillville High in 2010. I love Burrillville. I wouldn‚Äôt think twice about coming back and raising a family here. Currently, however, the town is facing a glaring issue. While my friends and I smoked a ton of weed in high school, we never encountered or spoke of opiates. Last year, Burrillville, Rhode Island was the overdose capital of the United States. Since my graduation in 2010, 12 people, I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre represented here tonight, have been killed by opiates. Among the dead, my little brother, Jackson Weintraub, killed at 23 years old by fentanyl on August 27th, 2017.


This is the type of talk that‚Äôs normally done for kids, by somebody who hasn‚Äôt been a kid in 40 years. This is the type of talk that is usually unrelatable, usually corny and laughable. This type of talk usually involves men in suits wagging their fingers, with corny slogans and acronyms and McGruff the crime dog. Most outrageous of all, is that this is the type of talk that‚Äôs never dealt with addiction. Someone that‚Äôs never seen loved ones die, never felt the throes of helplessness and depression.
This is a different kind of talk about addiction, drugs and mental illness. I‚Äôve seen it my whole life, in myself and in the people I love. Everything I‚Äôm about to tell you is true.

 When I was 7, ecstasy killed my cousin. Michael Snizek was a freshman at Providence College when he dropped some E and died in September of 1999. My family was rocked by it- it was the first time we‚Äôd seen drugs take a life. It‚Äôs no coincidence that Michael Snizek was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder a few years prior to his death.
I‚Äôd encounter ecstasy and Molly more than a few times during my ‚Äúclubbing‚Äù phase when I turned 18. I have some friends, though they may never admit it, that used the stuff on a daily basis. When my cousin died, I made an unspoken promise to my family that I‚Äôd never touch the stuff, and would never risk making them relive that painful experience. I kept that promise.

When I was 10, heroin killed my uncle. Alan Weintraub overdosed, upstairs in my grandparents home at 40 years old. I remember the phone call from my rattled grandfather, to my dad, telling him what had happened. In an eerily familiar situation in hindsight, my dad lost his little brother to opiates in September of 2002. This was pre-epidemic, when opiate overdoses weren‚Äôt a daily occurence in Rhode Island as they are now. It‚Äôs no coincidence that my Uncle Alan displayed signs of mental illness his entire life.

This was the first I had heard of ‚Äúheroin.‚Äù It was a crash course on the reality that if you mess around with heroin, there‚Äôs a good chance it‚Äôll kill you. When my uncle died, I made an unspoken promise to my family that I‚Äôd never touch the stuff, and would never risk making them relive that painful experience. I kept that promise.

A few years later, I‚Äôd learn that several family members make routine visits to the methadone clinic and have for YEARS, because their opiate addiction still has control of them- and if they were to stop getting doses, even after all this time, they‚Äôd withdraw so badly that they could end up dead.

 Safe to say, I learned at a pretty young age that addiction and mental illness ran heavily in my family tree. I was a messed up kid. I was violent, anxious and constantly depressed starting as early as age 4. I still hear about it all the time- my family used to call me Norman Bates. Before my tenth birthday, I‚Äôd do two two-week inpatient stays at Butler Hospital, and be diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, GAD, OCD, ADHD, any other acronym you can think of that ends in D, and Tourette‚Äôs to top it all off. I‚Äôve been on antidepressants and stimulants off and on since I was six.

I smoked my first cigarette at 11 years old. I crept into my mom‚Äôs room while she was asleep, walked outside and choked it down.
I was 13 years old when I first smoked weed. A friend of mine bought a batch- didn‚Äôt have a bag, so he filled his own shoe with weed and walked a mile to Hauser Field in Pascoag half barefoot, where we met up and smoked. I didn‚Äôt know what being high felt like, so I smoked and smoked and smoked until I was so high that I lost control. I had a panic attack, ran screaming down the street, and banged on a stranger‚Äôs front door around midnight. I begged them to let me in, call the cops, call an ambulance, call the army- anything. I lucked out, and they happened to be the nicest people I think I‚Äôve ever met- and they happened to smoke a bit of reefer themselves, so they understood. They let me sleep on their couch and fed me nachos. I‚Äôm grateful for that experience now because I learned my limits pretty quickly.

By 16, I was smoking a pack of Newport 100‚Äôs a day. A battle with pneumonia had me switch to Skoal Apple chew, which was a habit I continued until 2016. To this day, I still chew a 20 pack of Nicorette a day.
In college, drugs were everywhere. I tried cocaine at a New Year‚Äôs party, and swore I‚Äôd never do it again- I liked it too much. Adderall was used as a form of currency at URI- I owe a lot of my academic success to it. And as you can imagine, people who are ‚Äúlucky‚Äù enough to have the seeds of addiction planted within them know, more than anyone, where to find the drugs.

My little brother Jackson was one of the ‚Äúlucky‚Äù ones.

Last year,, on August 27th, 2017, fentanyl killed my baby brother. To this day, I‚Äôm not entirely sure what the fentanyl was in. Was it heroin? Was it oxycontin? Unfortunately, I‚Äôll never know- but the reality is, fentanyl could be in anything. Jackson was unaware.

Jackson Weintraub was only 23 years old when he died. Fentanyl left my brother, the once vibrant, handsome, smart kid that many people knew and loved, dead, face down, cold and alone on a dirty old couch in a crack house, surrounded by people who didn‚Äôt care whether he was alive or dead. He was surrounded by people that at one time, I wanted to hunt down and beat to death. All that‚Äôs left of my brother now are pictures, a headstone, and painful memories. Today, he‚Äôs a sad statistic, not a person.

Jack was exactly two and a half years younger than I am. As a young kid, he was a pudgy little kid with a speech impediment. I looked out for him as much as I could. One time on the way home from school, good old Bus 5, a kid was yelling about how fat Jack was, until I socked him in the mouth so hard his face and nose were bleeding.

As a young adult, Jack was a stud- he was absolutely ripped, baby faced with blonde hair and blue eyes, and a pretty damn good drummer in a band. He and I would always share advice about girls- I introduced him to Tinder. We‚Äôd talk about everything. We had the same sense of humor, same love for baseball, animals, vegetarianism, same views on politics. If it‚Äôs humanly possible for two people to have the same voice, we did- Same laugh, we did- Same walk, we did. We used to call ourselves ‚ÄúWeintraub light and Weintraub dark,‚Äù the only
difference between us being my dark hair and complexion and his blonde hair and light skin. 

To this day, I find myself pulling out my phone to text him when I hear some obscure old baseball player‚Äôs name- to share some inappropriate memes that I know he‚Äôd love.

As much as I tried, I wasn‚Äôt always the greatest role model. I remember times as a teenager I‚Äôd walk into my house after midnight, slightly drunk and very high, to Jack‚Äôs judgemental eyes. I wrote a eulogy for his funeral. I wrote it in a haze, in about 20 minutes, about a time when we were kids, when Jack caught me with a pack of cigarettes and was heartbroken- and my response to him was ‚Äúnobody‚Äôs perfect.‚Äù And I think if Jack were here now to explain himself, he‚Äôd probably say the same thing: ‚ÄúNobody‚Äôs perfect.‚Äù And in hindsight, he‚Äôd be right- I see now that I‚Äôm no less flawed than he was- that I had no right to judge him for his addiction.

Through life, I always ended up feeling a responsibility for my brother‚Äôs actions. I smoked weed, Jack soon did- I was there when he first smoked pot. I picked up a cigarette habit- Jack soon did too.

This trend continued as we got older, but for the better. I smartened up, got my life together and went to college- so did Jack. I got plenty of girlfriends, believe it or not, and with my help in‚Äúcoaching‚Äù him out of his shell, so did Jack. I worked hard and studied hard, and Jack did too.
Drugs got in the way of that trend.
When I got my degree, I expected Jack to be right behind me- he dropped out of college. When I worked hard to try to build a career, Jack started having trouble holding a job.

 And then, while I was busy trying to live my life, Jack died. I feel some responsibility for that, too.

These old white guys that come to schools with Crime Dogs always tell you that drugs kill. That‚Äôs true, but they don‚Äôt tell you much about the people you leave behind when you die.

My mother, who‚Äôs now lost a nephew and a son to drugs, struggles to go on. The strong woman who raised 4 kids as a single mother while working two jobs, has been turned into a hollow shell. Time will heal her, but she‚Äôll never be the same.
My father, the man who saved my life and added stability to my life when I had none, has now lost a brother and a son to drugs. My dad is a tough SOB, but struggles with guilt, sadness and loneliness every single day.

And then there‚Äôs me. After my brother‚Äôs death, I lost all sense of who I was. I DESPISED myself.

‚ÄúYou let him die,‚Äù I‚Äôd say to myself every night when my head hit the pillow, and every morning when I opened my eyes. ‚ÄúYou judged him. You were too hard on him. You forced him to go to rehab and that‚Äôs where he found opiates and that‚Äôs where you killed him.‚Äù

The day he died, I had to call my mom and tell her that her son was dead. That moment, and that day, brought the depression and anxiety I had struggled with in childhood roaring back. It hit me like a ton of bricks. I was afraid to leave my house, my bed, afraid to go to work, afraid to face my family, my friends. I was afraid to BE ALIVE.

 The guilt and shame and sorrow that I felt after my brother passed away manifested itself as a Major Depressive Episode, as diagnosed at RI Hospital during a week long outpatient stint. During this time, suddenly I understood what I failed to see while my brother was alive.

He was in so much pain. Not physically, but mentally. The hopelessness, fear and shame that had crippled me was present in him too. He was desperate to escape- as was I- and his drug use was only a symptom of the illness he faced. Shortly before he died, it‚Äôs no coincidence that Jackson was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder.

Slowly over the course of what seemed like an eternity, I started pulling myself together. I went back to work. I started talking about how I felt. I started talking about my brother. I admitted that yes, he overdosed, but yes- he was an amazing person. I was able to speak at the high school about it. I was fortunate enough to go to Washington DC- little out of my league- for the Addiction Prevention Forum family day last month. I was humbled by the amount of people there, the talent of people there, the determination of people there. These people took what happened to them, the people they loved and the people they lost, with them to DC and used their stories to try and enact change. I had one big takeaway from it all: The one silver lining about an epidemic is that it‚Äôs too big to ignore.

I took my brother there with me. I‚Äôm much more prepared now- much more able to understand struggle, much more patient. The reality is, it took losing my best friend, the closest alternative to me without being me, the Weintraub light to my Weintraub dark, to realize that addiction isn‚Äôt something to be punished. That life TRULY is too short to hold grudges. That when shit hits the fan, all you really have is your family, your friends, and the people that you love and that love you- that‚Äôs all that matters. If you don‚Äôt have that, IF YOU LET YOURSELF LOSE  THAT- you have  NOTHING.

It started as a teenager, opioids became by DOC however i got clean relatively quickly (within 6 months) and was satisfied with a moderate methadone dose and some weed for many years afterwards.

At about the age of 24, roughly 5 years since using opioids recreationally (I had already been wiened of opioids and it worked fine) I developed nerve pain to a degree that I can't even explain. Within the first week I felt so bad i thought I was dying, but I didnt die, I  just kept feeling that bad week after week, day after day

About a year in I chose to go back to opioids with the rules of ""Never to use IV"" and ""Never to use to get high, only to relieve pain"". I was in so much physical pain i became suicidal.

I held out for about a year but of course i chose opioids over suicide for my mothers sake. about half the week i would be back to my old self, the other half i'd be lying in bed all day. My parents quickly surmised was i was doing and helped me until i got a methadone prescription for pain, however my doctor would not raise it over 35mgs and I had already been taking 80mg for pain.

Now I have a very atypical addiction. I require at least 100mgs of methadone to get pain relief, im not sure of an exact dose of other opioids, however 30mgs of dilaudid intranasally is plenty for an entire day of pain relief. I'm not physically addicted despite my high tolerance, I take 3-4 days off each week and i dont experience withdrawal, only my original symptoms. However this pain relief is SO important to my life. If someone tried to take away I'd rip their head off. It isn't fun to only live 3-4 comfortable days and then to be ridiculously sick for 3-4 days, but in my opinion its better to be that sick EVERY day when im only 28 years old.

Over this Memorial Day Weekend, me and my girlfriend got drunk and I blacked out and started a fight. Guess I went through her phone after she passed out and woke her up with accusations of infidelity (I‚Äôm a piece of shit, I know). 

Anyways, she kicked me out and I‚Äôm living at my grandmother‚Äôs again. All my stuff is at her place, so I really don‚Äôt have anything to do aside from overthink and smoke excessive amounts of cigarettes. 

As if that‚Äôs not all stressful enough, I‚Äôm currently withdrawaling from a pretty strong Vicodin/Percocet habit. They‚Äôre her drug of choice, and I started to using them with her. So, essentially, she‚Äôs my only connection and I‚Äôm fucked. It‚Äôs only day two and I can‚Äôt think straight, function, get comfortable, stop sweating, my bones ache, my nose is a spigot, and my heart is broken to boot. 

All in all, I‚Äôm stuck between feeling bad for her due to my stupidity, and feeling bad for myself due to my dependency. 

That‚Äôs really it. I dunno what else to say.

Im seeing my psych tomorrow to start on a suboxone plan tomorrow as the withdrawals are too distressing to go cold turkey and not have my work/uni life fall apart (and say do a week of inpatient detox).

Im using tonight, around .4 total. I sniff and can stay well on 0.3-05 a day. I would rather not get on long term maintenance so I'll be going for a short term at-home suboxone detox. I will be discussing my plan and script with my psych tomorrow. I'm thinking a minimum of 2 weeks with say: 8mg tomorrow, 4mg the next day them 2mg for 3 days followed by 1mg and 0.5mg for a week respectively. Does this sound about right to come off with minimal pain? I've only been using dope for a few months and codeine for a few months before that. Never more than 3-4 days a week.

Also, given im using tonight when should I take my first dose of suboxond tomorrow? Can I take it in the evenings?

I've been on methadone for quite awhile now with no success, as I had a pretty bad fentanyl habit before this, so now I'm on 250mg methadone, and my last visit to the doctor I told him how i've been just searching for stronger alternatives now to get through the methadone and how i haven't been happy/content on methadone so far n it's not really helping me a whole lot, he finally said to me in our last meeting ''would you like to try and switch to Kadian then?'' I was relieved he mentioned this as i've been thinking about how much better that would probably be for me, I just wanted to see if anyone else has had any experience with Kadian despite how new it is in the MMT options. 

I'm just out here visiting my home city, when I get back to where I live i'll be starting on the Kadian.. for this week until the 7th it's gonna be methadone.

Just wanted to see how people like it, and how sick do you think I might get in the transition from methadone to Kadian? and what dose am I gonna have to be on? I'm looking forward to it. 
i'm hoping it'll make me feel better than I've felt for the last months, i've been suicidal awhile back, but i'm feeling hopeful now that this will change.

8mw7bk,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8mw7bk/a_methadone_review/,0,https://redd.it/8mw7bk,sloan_fitch,A Methadone Review,"The deed is done. I'd like to think that I did it for scientific reasons but the truth is that I was hoping it would get me high. Did it? Not sure. I felt something but it was definitely quite mild. I took 2mg of Suboxone early on the first day and consumed 20\-40ml of Methadone. On day two I drank the remainder which was probably like 20\-25ml. The first day I drank the meth around 6pm. On the second day I drank it at 8am. Since I was taking and tapering down subs for days prior, it's possible that the built\-up bupe in my bloodstream blocked some of the effects of Methadone but in my experience with dope, I'm usually able to get high later in a day when I take 2mg of bupe.

My appetite was not adversely affected and my athletic abilities seemed to have all remained. That said, the Methadone did make me feel sleepy. I was compelled to take naps after eating lunch on both days on Methadone. Didn't lay down for more than an hour or two but it was still a strong compulsion. Each night I also had no trouble getting a good night's sleep.

Finally, day three with no Methadone left it was time to consider when to start taking Suboxone. It worked out better than expected. I figured that I'd either go through the better part of the day getting sick and gradually sicker before I could safely take a sub. So while w aiting to feel sick enough to take a sub I felt mostly quite fine. No gastro symptoms but the yawns were coming on and ss some may say, ""once the yawns start, it's over."" In this case, although I had the yawns and a little wateryness in the eyes, I didn't encounter any other symptoms to any appreciable strength. Sure, coldness was a little more noticable but it's not really that cold inside or outside. Frankly I was digging for symptoms and none of them were particularly srong aside from the yawns.

No anxiety except for that which stems from the thought, ""when can I take a sub without getting sick?"" Also, a concern about work. I knew that I'd be good to take a sub by tomorrow morning before work without the risk of encountering PWD but what if I got called into work tonight and said yes without thinking? Sure enough, my supervisor did call me and asked if I wanted to come in and work for four hours in the evening. So I did a little reading and made some decisions based on my situation.

My situation:

As stated above, I took a total of 60ml of Methadone over the course of two days. I consumed a smaller amount on the second day than I did on the first day. After a normal night's sleep I counted the hours since my last dose of Methadone. From 8AM on Sunday to 12PM on Monday I had 26 hours. At 3pm I had 29 hours under my belt.

In retrospect, I counted all wrong. At the time my wishful thinking had me calculate 4PM as the 36 hour mark. Boy was I wrong as I think about it now and boy was I lucky. Well, maybe not lucky. The science of the matter is that it's important for a person who has been taking Methadone for multiple days or weeks to wait a minimum of 36\-48 hours to induce subs. In fact, I've read longer in many cases for good reason. For me, the dose was already somewhat low and the time spent taking the meth was short.

Normally I take Suboxone no sooner than 12 hours after my last use of dope or pills. I've taken it at the 9 hour mark once with great fear in my heart but was indeed in withdrawal so it worked out. I heard that if you take a small amount of Suboxone before using dope, then use dope that you could induce and take subs once more without PWD as long as you no longer feel high. Since I did take 2mg of Suboxone a few hours before the first dose of Methadone, maybe this played a role? If not, then I'd say the other factors were at play. The time spent \(2 days\), the dose and the timing of the follow\-up Suboxone. Well heck, probably all of those factors along with the initial 2mg dose of Suboxone prior to taking the Methadone contributed to my good outcome.

For good meansure I started with .25mg of Suboxone. Then another .5mg after concluding that I did not feel any worse after 40 minutes. Then 30 minutes later I took 1mg. In the end I did take a total of \~\~4mg\~\~ 3mg. Although I mostly have subs in pill form, I had a couple of strips and I opened one in order to have greater certaintly to the dosage being administered.

I remember my friend Tim told me about his Precipitated Withdrawal experience. Six hours after doing a lot of dope he didn't feel great so he thought it was time to take a sub. He did a whole strip. Then when he got fucking sick from that he did another and another. A lot of people think similarly to him \(maybe not to the same extremes\) and figure more of a good thing is better.

Point is, less is more with subs. I've read it here from other people and I've learned it myself. The only time less isn't more is when you're in regular withdrawal and are comparing the therapeutic effects of 1mg to 4mg. 1mg just doesn't seem to touch it. That, or like many others I'm just impatient to wait and see. A lot of people probably up their dose after not seeing desirable effects from the first dose.

Bottom line, by the time I took the last mg of Suboxone and had \~\~4mg\~\~ 3mg in me, I felt very well. After biking to work I felt like a million bucks. Would a smaller dose of Suboxone have been potentiated by the biking? I wonder how much lower of a dose I might've been able to get away with.

Last but not least importantly. Thank you to those who shared their wisdom in[ that previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8mcxw9/as_far_as_derrick_is_concerned_cliff_might_as/) even if I didn't follow it, I appreciate all warnings that are intended to prevent precipitated withdrawal.

This batch was MUCH stronger than the last, and I told him this numerous times. He normally listens to me because I have more experience than him, as well as I just read a shit ton of stuff on drugs in general. Anyway, we did some last night and it was pretty good shit. I did ~18 mg and he did ~25. 
   For a little background, my friend somehow needs more than the average dose of any drug to feel the effects. We hung out last night, all was good. He even bought a scale because I warned him this stuff is too dangerous to eyeball. He dropped me off at my house around 10 pm last night and I told him for probably the 20th time to be safe and ask me if he has any questions. Cue me nodding off and waking up every 30 minutes til around 3 am. He'd been texting me saying he's just super tired and isn't euphoric so he's gonna take more etc and I suggest maybe 10 mg more but do half of it and then wait a lil then do the other 5 mg if necessary. (Even if I said don't take anything he still would take some sadly).
   Well we were gonna hang out today and I get no texts or anything. I had a crazy dream he overdosed last night and his parents traced it back to me etc and I'm fucked for life. Cue a few minutes ago, I get a text from him saying not only did he get caught with the dope but he overdosed... His sister resuscitated him and he's been in the hospital all day. The thing that confuses us both is he doesn't recall if he overdosed last night or this morning. He said he remembers dropping me off at my house then waking up in an ambulance today.

8mv6kb,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8mv6kb/opium_experience_report/,9,https://redd.it/8mv6kb,trameyes,Opium experience report,"Well I got ahold of some opium from the onion farmland nearby (wink), it was in a form of caramel-colored crumbs/shards (not powder-like though) and it smelt very earthy/planty. I'm not physically addicted to opiates FYI and use them only occasionally. 

Smoking it off foil proved to be unsuccessful, it took a long time for it to melt and it wouldn't really produce any vapor strangely enough, or maybe I'm just a noob since I've never smoked anything off foil before. So I just decided to eat it. 

The taste was overwhelmingly bitter, so I gulped it down with some water. About an hour in produced the familiar body warmth sensation that you all folks love over here, and the high lasted around 6 hours. To be honest it was pretty underwhelming because it wasn't really any stronger than codeine, although my prior kratom use might've had to do with that, and I was eating quite small amounts since I didn't want to accidentally overdose. 

The coolest part was when I'd decided to eat a bit more than I did before, I laid down on my bed listening to some ambient/drone music and got nodding quite hard. I started having these weird visions, kinda like dreaming but actually being awake - for example I'd hallucinate that I opened my phone and checked my messages but then realised that my eyes were actually closed and I wasn't moving. Very weird. Also started remembering some details from my past which I haven't thought about in a while. 

All in all kind of underwhelming since I thought of opium as this mysterious antique drug, but the experience was worth it. At least now I can brag to people that I did it lol. The biggest downside is that I had a very hard time trying to take a piss next day after using. ",1527557731.0

( x-post from r/chronicpain ),"Two and a half weeks back I started to look into possibly getting Ketamine infusions because of the results it yields. I‚Äôm a chronic pain sufferer, having arthritis in my back and neck and I‚Äôm not even old enough to legally drink. Pain is something that takes a toll on my day, my whole day revolves around my pain. Well, I decided to do six Ketamine infusions and it was the best thing I could have done. Having had an opiate addiction, depression, anxiety, chronic pain, all of these diseases were eliminated if not then minimized a significant amount. It‚Äôs weird not having back pain anymore, like I don‚Äôt know what to do because I‚Äôm used to it controlling my day all of the time. I‚Äôm still in the habit of popping my back even though I don‚Äôt have to. The back pain is still there a little bit but almost unnoticeable. I forget about it until someone ask me how it is and I realize there‚Äôs a little bit of discomfort. The main benefits for me was my cravings for dope absolutely disappeared, throughout the six infusions the dr asked me how my cravings were twice and I had 100% forgotten about the word cravings. It was insane. My anxiety and depression have practically been eliminated entirely. Please read up about the benefits of Ketamine and give it a try. It changed my life and it can change yours too.

I was using almost everyday from August 2013 to November 2016. I got caught by my parents. No freak out, they were just scared and worried about me. I've been clean ever since. I lost my job, my car, my independence due to heroin. Had to move back in with my parents. Well they moved 60 miles north of where we were living at the time and I had no choice but to go with them. My job was super well paying for my age. Now I'm stuck in a shitty retail knock off of what I'm doing. I'm trying to go back to school but you can't file for FAFSA if you didn't file your taxes, which I didn't for 2016 because I owed the IRS money somehow. Now I'm trying to get that all figured out, but can't because I'm always working my shitty dead end job.

I'm getting depressed. Made a post on whisper trying to cold cop, got ripped off. The kratom is starting to fail and I'm looking for any reason to get high.

I'm sorry if this seems all over the place, I'm on my phone and just sort of typing as the thoughts come to my head. I'm not really looking for any responses I just wanted to get this out there.

This sub has taught me some of the subtle differences to look for in pressed polls.  First the M didn't have the webbing in the ""armpits"" as I've heard it described here which was a huge red flag.  Then the 1 in the ""10"" looked straight like ""l"" instead of a ""1"".  Lastly I broke one open and looked for some sparkles in the inside and there were none.  Definite fakes.  Unfortunately I lost all the money I bought them with but at least I didn't try popping a bunch of them.  Who knows what the hell is in them.

I hear sirens. I figure they're for me so I book it up to my other doctor's office (not pain management) who I figure will give me a hand and advise me he does.

So, onto the question. I am curious if anyone reacts this way or has seen someone react this way to heroin use. I've been using on and off (intravenously) for about 5 years. Probably about a year into my use heroin started to affect me differently. I wouldn't do the typical sit back and nod.

What happens is I'll start to go into somewhat of a psychosis (the closest word I can think of to describe it) and I'll begin to do many different ""odd"" things. I'll start to sweat profusely (like to the point where my body is dripping wet), I'll sometimes start to get naked, I'll scratch my body all over (scratching hard enough to break skin, it's very unsightly), pull out chunks of my hair, scream/yell/cry very loudly.... And the weirdest thing is I never know I'm doing these things WHILE I'm doing them. I'm completely unaware until I come down and usually have people pissed at me/freaked out.

Can anyone give me an explanation for this? Or relate to this?",1527547764.0

Of course every one of my connects are sleeping, and I'm sick as a dog. So I decide to do something very dumb and try to cold cop in the middle of the night.

I've cold copped successfully a couple times, but it's always been during normal hours.  I hit the normal spot in the projects, but no one is out.  As I'm driving away, I see a guy walking down the main road.  I stop at a red light and all he's looking at me, so I ask him if he has P.  He says he does and I let him in my car.

As soon as he gets in, I know he's lying because he starts saying ""now where did I put it..."".  I ignore his instructions to drive down side streets and head to a gas station on the border of the hood and park at a pump.

He finds a big bag and I know it's not dope as soon as I see it.  No one is carrying a half ounce of solid rock dope in a back pack at 4am.  He at least should have had it in glassine bags, then he probably would have got me.

He breaks off a couple chunks and gives them to me, I try to dissolve a tiny piece and it doesn't do anything, the rock just sits there.  He says I need to grind it up.  I tell him to get out of my car and he demands a ride back to where I got him.  I'm not driving back into the hood. Especially when he is trying to rob me.  He won't get out and is demanding $20.  He starts reaching like he has a gun, so I pop him in his jaw as hard as I can and hop out the car.  It's obvious he's all talk at this point because he didn't do anything.  I tell him I'm gonna drag him out the car if he doesn't get out and I walk to his side, he finally gets out but he's standing by the door demanding money.  I get back in and so does he, I hit him again and dodge his punch back by getting out.  He finally closes the door and I lock it.  He takes one final swing at me through the window as I drive off.

I haven't been in a fight in like 9 years, so my adrenaline is pumping.  I'm sick and I didn't want to deal with that, I knew I should've just waited a couple hours but the sickness took over my thoughts.  I'm a big guy, but I'm not a tough guy.  He thought he had an easy mark.

I said if he's lucky I'd paper the shit out of the whole city, but that I wasn't feeling nice and would involve the cops.  (which you all know I'd never do in a million years but he believed me so that's all that matters) I also said and on top of it that that wouldn't be all I'd continue to make it my mission to make his life a living hell and that he would always have to watch his back. 

Remember that pimp dude I told you guys about? So he actually turned out to be cool and backed WAY the fuck off once I ignored him for like a month. I told him about this and h'es a super big guy with a ton of friends and he said if I couldn't take care of it he would. His marijuana cafe is also right across from my house and his cameras look right onto my building door so he has footage of fuckboy stealing my phone.

I know some of you might disagree with myt hreat to go to the popo..but honestly please know I would NEVER actually do it.

I been checking this sub for ages. 
You guys are the coolest. I‚Äôm serious -most posts and comment threads are heartfelt and/or funny, sad too. 
Question: have the internet rules changed? Seems like cold-copping via the internet just got like hard to impossible. Hope that doesn‚Äôt break the sub rules. But I‚Äôm just wondering. 

Anyway, I gotta come clean - I‚Äôve been using for many years. I moved cities about 15 years ago to get away from problems. My2best friends fell pray, and had to get clean, so I took up my brother‚Äôs offer to live with him until I got it together. But problems have a way of following you everywhere, don‚Äôt they? Hahahaha. 
So now, I‚Äôve been chipping for the past year. Only snorting, taking 1-2 days off every week. I cop a half g (my guy is essentially a middle, and deals half and full Gs, no buns or stamp bags - yes I know that places me on the EC) on Monday and a full G on Thursday. Every damn week. I get upcharged cuz middle, so it‚Äôs $375 every week. Steady, reliable. Sometimes it‚Äôs got that almost gray-blue look to it, sometimes it‚Äôs re-rocked,  but it‚Äôs generally pretty good. 
Oh, and - my d-boy is a friend of my boss. They both have serious habits. You believe that shit? Lol. 2 middle aged family guys, pulling in millions, driving their Mercedes back to their houses on some Circle, with a pool, brought to their knees by dope. They actually prefer fent-cut shit, but I try and tell them that pure shit is better. Sometimes I go into my boss‚Äô office and he jams a letter opener into his big-ass 3G bag and sticks it under my nose. Then he chews me out because I have to make deadlines or draft a document hahahaha. It‚Äôs freakin crazy, y‚Äôall. White collar junky. 
I‚Äôm the guy at work in the bathroom stall taking hits off a pen cap, ‚Äúwow your eyes are so blue today! Your pupils are so small!‚Äù My eyes are green, lady. And shut up about it. 

I went up to the family vacation spot a few weeks ago. I think I got food poisoning - it lasted for a day, then I was fine. But I mighta been dope sick. 
That‚Äôs when I realized, I‚Äôm really playing with Fire (no pun intended), and I need to make a change. If I‚Äôm afraid of getting sick, even if it‚Äôs just like mental stuff, then I‚Äôm too deep in it. Chipping for a year will get you. It will always get you. That‚Äôs just what happens - dope always wins. Until you tell it to fuck right off (and mean it).
So today I‚Äôm on the couch, chillin on a sub. Not sure how I‚Äôm going to move forward.
Thanks for reading! You guys are the best!

I am a chronic pain patient and have been on 20mg IR oxycodone tablets 4x a day for a little over a year. Unfortunately my condition is a degenerative bone disease so the bones in some of my joints are slowly dying.  It's...very painful to say the least.

I (mostly) take my medication as prescribed.  Once in a while if I'm bored on a weekend I'll rail one or two.

Last visit to my pain doc, I asked if there's any other medication I should be considering that would be more effective.  He went on to explain that for someone like me, who has to be on opiates for the foreseeable future to live my day to day life, he would normally suggest moving to Opana ER (oxymorphone?).  He said ""So maybe...I'd give you like 20mg Opana ER 2x a day and then maybe...like 5 mg of oxycodone 2x a day for breakthrough pain.""

He said he would write the new scripts that visit but I was unsure which treatment plan would best treat my pain.  I know pain is very subjective so it will be hard for someone to give a straight answer to me but...I'd just like some of your experienced input on if one of these plans is glaringly obviously better than the other.

Thanks guys!

I just wanted to type up a quick post suggesting tianeptine to those who enjoy opiates - I took 350mg about an hour and a half ago and am definitely feeling pretty good. This is a pretty high dose but I was looking to experience it on a recreational level and have some tolerance to opiates with recent use. If you decide to try it, work your way up don‚Äôt use my dose as a benchmark, everyone‚Äôs biochemistry and tolerance are different. That being said this drug doesn‚Äôt cause much respiratory depression and has a great safety profile. I‚Äôve heard withdrawals can be pretty rough but don‚Äôt plan on using it very often, despite using other opiates with more regularity. It definitely has opiate activity at this dose - my mood is quite elevated, and my pupils a bit constricted. If I stay still I‚Äôll ‚Äúnod‚Äù in a way, not to the extent of a large dose of other opiates but I‚Äôll kindve close my eyes for a bit and not want to open them. I‚Äôll also add that I am starting to get than opiate itch, which I personally enjoy. Even though my dose is mostly just starting to kick in, I‚Äôve read that the duration is extremely short, 2-4 hours with the sodium salt. Can‚Äôt comment on the sulphate version of this compound currently but I did get some for future experimentation.

I‚Äôve used this drug a long time ago with no tolerance - I forget what amount, but it was definitely a recreational dose and I had no tolerance at the time. The nod on the occasion was much stronger along with extreme pupil construction. So for people new to opiates, again, use good judgement ingesting, it can be stronger than what I‚Äôm making it out to be currently.

This drug has a lot going for it in that it is relatively cheap, legal, and has nootropic qualities. Worth researching if that kindve thing is of interest to the reader. It‚Äôs a unique opiate in that it is a tricyclic antidepressant, not a traditional opiate but demonstrates mu and delta agonist qualities with no kappa affinity. In layman‚Äôs terms, it effects the brain in the way that an opiate with desirable qualities would at larger doses.

I wanted this to be a quick informative dip your toes in the info type post, ill end it here and go back to enjoying my high.

If anyone has any experience or info regarding tianeptine, feel free to add it. For those with questions, I‚Äôll try my best to answer them with the preface I‚Äôm no expert on it or pharmacology.

Thanks for reading and consider trying it if you enjoy opiates.

Thanks for reading all!

Relapsed, almost killed myself about 3 times driving on heroin, benzos, and alcohol (with a pending DUI mind you). Got kicked out of the house, roommate steals my macbook and my camera. And now my girl found out I took her bars and told me shes probably leaving me (I'm thinking she wont but I still feel wretched because I love the piss out of her) and she doesn't even know I went on a week heroin bender. Also left an implied suicide note for my baby sister to find and traumatize the fuck out of her.

Luckily I didn't slam anything and I got about two weeks of squatting essentially at my grandparents to figure some shit out but man am I spinning rn. I think Layne Staley once said 'used to be curious, now this shit is sustenance'. It's like something I can never run away from, and since I'm still battling wicked depression, trauma, anhendonia from being of opiates I've been substituting other downers even before the relapse. I guess it's just time to buckle down and get some mental health and addiction related support and try and preserve. I also lost my card and wont have money till Thursday and ate my 2 bars I had saved for detox right now on day one because of the s/o. 


Did I mention I lost my job for calling in to support my lady while she had a medical procedure and then showed up high the next day, like nodding standing up high.


Man I really screwed the pooch here. But all is not lost. I just really dont want to lose the girl, shes a real gem and I love her more than life itself at times(yes I know that I at times engage in borderline codependency with her). But my best friend from birth who doesn't even drink seems to have secured a really cheap room and wants me on my feet so I am grateful for that and having a room to kick dope in.

 Any kind words or advice would really brighten my day. No negativity please, I have enough guilt as is and I know everyone of you regulars here have done this or worse a million times over. Precisely why I post here. I'm gonna hit a meeting tomorrow, get a sponsor, and get in it to win it or I'm shooting dope on the street again or in box.

TL/DR
Relapsed, almost died, got kicked out, a roommate stole computer, stole from gf and she may leave me, lost my job, and left my baby sis a suicide note now I'm all fucked up but not going back to junk

much love, 
if theres anyone on here who remembers me, esp. tinychat please chime in

I live in the UK and am on diamorphine (pure heroin) maintenance.

I get 7 packs of 5 100mg injectable ampules once a week from the chemist. It costs me ¬£28 a week.

The heroin is pure and I just mix it with sterile water and inject it intravenously.

I feel completely normal and live a completely normal and functional life with a well-paying job and a family. I have been for 15 years since being able to access legal pure heroin.

All the problems I experienced back in the day that are blamed on ‚Äúheroin‚Äù are really the result of the PROHIBITION of heroin.

So, yesterday I went with my dad and sister to my dad‚Äôs friend, my ‚ÄúUncle‚Äù Ricky‚Äôs house, (if you‚Äôre Italian you‚Äôd understand that, considering he‚Äôs not really my uncle). He actually just called me but that‚Äôs irrelevant. 

So i went over to his house yesterday ‚Äúsober‚Äù just off about 2.25 mg of Alprazolam and some bud. 
*Quick backstory*
The other night I stole my dad‚Äôs car to attempt to score which was a bust but regardless my parents found out. So when my dad told me about the party I said I‚Äôd probably go, and my dad texted me the day after I stole the car and said, ‚ÄúRicky really wants you to come to the party.‚Äù So I said, that‚Äôs fine, I‚Äôll go, but on my soul if it turns into a mini Intervention I‚Äôm going to be pissed.‚Äù So he said it wouldn‚Äôt, whatever. So we get there, I‚Äôm high just from the bars and loud and I‚Äôm saying hi to people. 

I‚Äôm so not used to being around Italians, even though I am predominantly Italian. Sicilian, whatever. 

I went up to this one older gentleman whom my dad knew and I guess I had met a lot back when I was 7 or so. Anyway, I went to shake his hand and nope, kiss on the cheek üòò. So cute I didn‚Äôt mind at all. 

Anyways, I sit down at the adult‚Äôs table, essentially, and I meet this man named Tom. Okay y‚Äôall from the second I sat down I was just... mesmerized by him. Very cute, older, extremely sarcastic and goofy and... ugh, I can go on for forever. Was in the Army for 20 years, plays PC games like I do... let me stop. So me and him were somewhat briefly discussing my H, amongst other things, use, and he was telling me about how he‚Äôs been sober from 20 years and that he used to fuck with Meth and Vodka. Well... there‚Äôs the Grey Goose bottle in front of us and I was pouring a shot for myself. 

I was like, ‚ÄúOh my God I‚Äôm so sorry, is this a trigger?‚Äù He‚Äôs like, ‚Äú20 years üòä‚Äù so I said, ‚ÄúAnd do they ever go away?‚Äù ‚ÄúNope‚Äù, so I said ‚ÄúExactly, lol‚Äù. 

Long story short, after him and I talked her had me talk to his wife and y‚Äôall.... I cried, it was but wasn‚Äôt like anything anyone else has said to me. Of course I was drunk by that point but regardless she did say some relevant things.

And the funniest of all? 
It did turn into a lil mini intervention but I didn‚Äôt even care. 

TL;DR, had a great night, got drunk, and realized some shit regarding my use.",1527455387.0

Fuck. He‚Äôs our only connect. So I made a post on CL and Whisper trying to figure something out, and while I was waiting on a response we decided to try and cold cop. We don‚Äôt live in a major city so this is way easier said than done. 

We‚Äôre walking around the ‚Äúbad‚Äù part of town (the worst part of where I live is no where near dangerous by any definition of the word...or so I thought), talking to random people asking the usual questions when some big black dude runs up on us with a glock and takes my fucking wallet. Now we‚Äôre sick AND we‚Äôre broke. 

We cut our loses and start heading home. The only responses to my posts so far were the usual ‚Äúgive me head and I‚Äôll give you a G‚Äù type shit and we‚Äôre having none of that. Then a dude asks ‚Äúwhat are you looking for‚Äù (all I said in the CL post was that I was in pain and they don‚Äôt have my meds at the pharmacy). After I explain what we need and that we just got robbed this guy said if I can make it to him he can help us out. 

This dude gave us a .30 for free just because we were struggling. All he asked for in return is that we try to hook him up with any single chicks we know. Matt, idk if you use this Sub at all, but if you‚Äôre out there, thank you man. You‚Äôre a fucking saint. ",1527454431.0

Whats up ya'll? Been lurking here for a long time, I've recently come out of the closet with my habit in hopes I can maybe help a few people on this road we all love and hate so much. I'm 27, been a daily pot smoker for 11 years, was a daily drinker for 3 years and an opiate freak for the last 5 (they helped me kick the booze) :P..was prescribed Vicodin for 2 weeks followed by Tramadol for a skateboarding injury, my doc kept feeding me Tram for 2 years afterwards, think he felt bad because my ankle was not re-set before it was casted, healed a bit weird and still hurts to this day. When he cut me off, the withdrawals sent me into a hellish spiral of major depression and hardcore withdrawal as my daily dose was up to 300 mg per day, he refused to put me back on the hydro. 

 As a result i started looking for other shit and was quickly introduced to the beauty of harder opi's, namely blues and dilly shields, they kicked the ickies of coming off of Tram completely and honestly, gave me a feeling of peace and normalcy that ive never had before. I suddenly started making tons of friends, got more than enough attention from chicks (who sometimes just wanted me for my drugs or to ""fix"" me, i got off on letting them try). And honestly my work and social life just improved overall, I loved the lifestyle and all that it came with..better yet, i could afford it. I won $5,000 on the lottery at the peak of my use also which did me absolutely no good, i bought as many blues, 15's and dilly's as i could afford, blew the 5 g's in 3 weeks and had the best summer of my life..was up to 5 blues n 2-3 dilly's a day at my peak.

And then it came to a screeching halt. I lost my main plug, my online plug pulled an exit scam (he didnt rip me off personally, ironically he sent me my shit and disappeared 2 days later with a bunch of other peoples money), and i was forced to start a new job with less hours all at the same time. Since then, i've made it by on consistent monthly scripts (not my own) of 60 K-56's, 90 5 and 30 7.5 MG hydro, like 10 mscontin 30's cuz the dude only gets 30 and refuses to sell more..but these are my regular pickups monthly these days..and very occasionally, random treat bags such as this, the even more occasional point or two of boy..dboy sometimes calls trying to off some OP 40's that ill usually always grab asap, im partial to pills and will always look for em before i break down and grab a couple bindy's during rough times. My connections to better shit these days absolutely suck, which is probably a good thing for me..however no part of me wants to fully quit or go for treatment, yet. My use is nowhere near what it once was, but im still able to blow through 15 of the K-56's in a day, script of 60 typically lasts me a week tops, i pop hydro daily just to keep me straight and am always on the lookout for better shit, it sucks but i love it.

I dont know why im tellin ya'll all this this, guess there just arent many people i relate to IRL and i enjoy talking about drugs. Seem like a cool bunch of likeminded people here, im always down to talk if someones fucked up and needs an ear to bark at, always down to give advice or help out in any way that I can. I got alot to say and plenty'a good stories to share, hope ya'll have a good n safe holiday weekend. Sorry if this pic link doesnt work right, these are 3 blues and a few 15's i just got an extremely rare and lucky call on..funny i was just telling someone here how much i missed the U23's..the opiate gods heard my plea, sadly it's already almost gone :( hence the long winded, chatty post.",1527453794.0

Black seed oil, Xanax, lopermide, Magnesium Sulfate, Fish oil, Krill Oil, B Complex vitamin, Red Bali Kratom (GAIA), Kratom Extract (MOBotanicals), Phenibut, Tiantipine sulfate, Noopept, Creatine, one 7.5 Hydro, and as much exercise as I can muster (Running, Lifting, & Cycling)
Is this doable? 
It's crippling knowing my day and night depend upon a D boy. 

Thanks Friends :D

I saw my psychiatrist last week but I had slightly downplayed my use to mum (who was there with me) and didnt ask for any withdrawal meds. I wanted to do it alone; yet 48 hours later the withdrawals were notably worse this week, my usual 20mg of lope wasnt providing relief and I was cold to the bone, sweating profusely, dissociated and freaking out. I ended up copping that day. I then contacted my psych with a suggestion of doing an at-home short term detox involving suboxone, diazepam and lyrica (that I will be sourcing myself). My psychiatrist has been following me for years with my mental health woes, is also awarr of passed MDMA, alcohol and marijuana abuse yet seems to be very trusting of me. He not only called me back within an hour, he also directly called up a GP specializing in substance disorders and referred me to see him first thing tomorrow. He is totally comfortable with the meds and suggestion I suggested which is amazing. He's truly an *awesome* psych.

I have a bit of a question tied to this post as well. Given a small amount (say a weeks worth of suboxone and diazepam) detox meds; what would my short detox/taper look like? Like specifically regarding doses per day? At this point in my use I can stay well on and cop a tiny buzz from like 0.2-0.3. But typically use at least half a G or more to have a dope day. I have used moderatrly in the last 3 days and will be today until tomorrow.Any advice is *truly* appreciated. And thank you to everyone here who has been so kind in providing reassurance and support!

I know urine retention affect most opiate uses but mine is out of control and really ruins the experience everytime I use.

The only time I can finally piss is around 8 hours after last use. It's to a point where I just can't enjoy the buzz because I know I'm going to sit there in pain for hours trying to pee.

I use fairy small amounts and take regular breaks so my tolerance is not that high. Is this something that people have noticed gets better as their tolerance goes up or its always a problem.

Another thing is I never had this issue much with oxy and dillys just morphine and heroin.

So after dinner I came by to speak. First a little catch\-up because he had a business idea weeks earlier that I wanted to hear about. Basically the idea involved drones to deliver goods, which is actually what Amazon has been working towards. I speculated that it would be risky for a fledgling company since the laws and regulatiosn for such venture are incomplete. Still, kicked ideas around and discussed what's presently going on and the possibilities as well as the current developments with regard to self\-driving cars.

&nbsp;

Anywho, I gave him some weed that I wanted him to try last week and he gave me some weed he had and also showed me his recently obtained batch of allegedly uncut dope. During our interaction he also asked me about Cliff as he went on to describe Cliff's recent behavior and communications to be very shady. Briefly I gave him a run\-down of my interactions with Cliff over the past week or two. Things like, ""I gave him the option to buy subs right after pay day, he said he didn't want or need any. Then he said he did but kept postponing only to have him ask if I could spare half a sub a week later."" I went on to confirm that Cliff was well in between pay checks while approaching script day.

&nbsp;

Regarding script day; I told Derrick if he ever get's told by Cliff that a certain day is script day that he could feel free to contact me to validate such a detail. Derrick went on to show me some text messages so that we'd be on the same page. Cliff fucked Derrick by accepting a bundle of dope on loan from him. Derrick paid full price for that and ended up having to scrap some silver in order to get the money to pay his dboy back. It was very important to him that he paid the dboy because he depends on him to come through when he makes an order so he knew he had to do right by his plug. 

Cliff's lies to Derrick and the promise to pay Derrick back depended upon Cliff getting his script on Wednesday. The text messages indicated he ran into a snag, but still showed optimism. Specifically, he claimed his local supermarket did not have the oxy script in stock so a text stated, ""They have it at the supermarket on the far end of town. I'm getting a cab now."" Followed by more postponements and stories. In fact, in order to testify that his lies were fact Cliff said in one of the messages ""my mom is in agonizing pain.. I have the receipt I can show you."" Now, I don't really understand what the receipt proves if he didn't even pick up the script; the receipt is what you get after paying for the script and getting it filled. I suppose he was claiming that the pharmacy gave him a receipt to indicate that they are in the process of filling the script. Not really sure but it doesn't matter because he's full of shit.

&nbsp;

Derrick didn't even bother asking to see the receipt, why bother wasting time reading and listening to a string of BS. In fact, Derrick is done with Cliff. Really \(very likely\) done serving, assisting, middling and/or dealing with Cliff \-\- no more. All the more reason not to ever go through Cliff if I ever wanted to buy myself dope again. I could just imagine the increased delays now that his only decent middle is no longer assisting him. That said, I'm really trying not to buy dope again from anyone. If I bought dope, I'd get high for a day... then have to take subs again, possibly more than the 2mg I've been taking. As I stand right now, I may not even need to buy more subs before the completion of my taper schedule. If I get myself down to 1mg in the next four days, I would still have a 16 day supply of subs at 1mg. If I bought dope on pay day, I'd probably have to buy more subs for good measure. So I'm highly motivated not to buy a bunch of dope. I've considered buying a bun and and a half but that money would be better spent on bike parts and clothes. Bar money too so that I can drink scotch while being attracting any lucky women who cross my path. I've been meaning to get myself back on the market. 

&nbsp;

Back to Derrick. He seems quite sincere about being done with Cliff. This last bundle of dope not being paid back in a timely manner was the last straw for him. He also went on to explain that he doesn't need Cliff's business, that he is already in a program and gets methadone daily. He middles because he can for his own pleasure and maybe a little as a favor for friends. This is the longest I remember Cliff being without drugs since Thanksgiving and possibly Christmas. Derrick didn't receive any more messages from Cliff after telling him that he was done serving him and dealing with his bullshit.

&nbsp;

I'm curious to see what Cliff does when he does get paid and has money for dope again. It's not impossible to find someone but I'm so glad that I won't be invovled with such an order under any circumstance. I'd imagine all manner of things would go wrong. If Cliff ran into a shortfall and wanted to have an extra day's of dope, if scamming me made it happen I know he would do it. For example, ""my friend delivered a half a bun, he's bringing the rest later tonight."" Then I'd be waiting as the time approached and Cliff would says ""he's waiting for his wife to go bed before he can sneak out and bring us the rest."" Then as it got later things would get bleak, maybe he'd pretend to make a phone call to his friend for a status update. When faced with such situations in the past I would offer to bike over to his ""friend's"" house to pick up the dope that the guy allegedly already has. On night one it wouldn't happen as we waited for the fictitious friend's wife to go to bed. Come three AM this ""wife"" would either still be up or it would be too late for the ""friend"" to drive over.

Come night two, I'd start early in offering to bike to the friend's house and Cliff would present optimism to that idea. ""Definitely tonight, less likely it'll be delivered"" or some crypic bullshit like that. Eventually I'd arrive at the conclusion that I'm not getting my half bun and a week later would receive pills to cover my loss. 

&nbsp;

Oh snap, I sidetracked and spoke about myself once again. Back to Derrick, again. So he layed out a bundle of dope to help Cliff get well on ""script day."" In reality, it was not script day. He went to the doctor that day but he can't get his script filled until Saturday. This is obviosuly not what he told Derrick. Hence the bullshit about having to get it filled at a pharmacy across town, bs reasons for delays prior to Derrick's messages where he basically states that he is done with Cliff's bullshit. 

Oh shit, brainstorm. It's a good thing that Cliff doesn't know I've directly bought Derrick. Even if he does have a hunch, he is never getting from Derrick again unless Derrick changes his mind. I could imagine Cliff asking me to place an order with Derrick for him. So I'd be middling to see a middle for Cliff. Fuck that. Never going to happen. 

&nbsp;

Bottom line, Cliff screwed his chief middle and is going to regret it. Scratch that. Will he regret that? I remember the time Cliff and Ben gave a fake hundred dollar bill to the dboy who identified it as such right away. The dboy still gave them a price break but obviously couldn't do anything with the fake bill and didn't accept it. One week later, the dboy delivered a batch of dope to Cliff and I. My part of the order was only $40, his share was over $200.

Right after the dboy left, we discovered the batch was 90&#37; fake. I firmly believe that was a result of the prior week's actions but Cliff denied and wouldn't accept that possibility. Thus he did not come to regret his choice of trying to pass a fake note off to his dboy. Just as he wont regret screwing Derrick even though his actions will prevent him from being able to procure through Derrick in the future. He won't have regret because as he lies to Derrick, me \(when he tells me the ""story""\) and himself the root cause of regret is obfuscated in a smokescreen of lies.

&nbsp;

Yes, eventually when Cliff is feeling better and more talkative he will contact me and say ""I have a story to tell you about Derrick."" He'll likely paint Derrick as the scumbag liar in the story though I've already saw their last message log so I'll look forward to comparing fact to fiction.

&nbsp;

P.S.\-

I didn't even mention the part where Derrick offered me 60mg of methadone from his take home bottle. Do I accept it? I've been on ever decreasing doses of bupe/subs for over a week. I'm curious what 15 or 30mg of methadone feels like but then I must also ask, ""what could go wrong?"" Well, regardless, Derrick is certainly not going to offer that 'done to Cliff. Had Cliff paid his debt or simply had not lied to Derrick in the first place to get a bun on loan, Derrick would've likely shared his take\-home dose to get help Cliff get well until the real script day.

All my money went to either food or H. I lost everything because of it. But now I have a wonderful relationship with an amazing woman I love dearly. I have a car. A home. A great job that I don't hate and can actually get up in the morning to go to without dreading every second of it.  And I've only been spending what I can afford to spend on opiates for the last 12 months now. 

If I'm ever in a pinch where I can't afford any, I stick with kratom. :) Alternating back and forth between recreational opiate use and kratom maintenance has been the best thing I could've done for myself. I was absolutely miserable when I was sober. I used H daily for 2/3 years. Up to 2gs a day at my worst. I quit cold turkey and was clean for 4 years and though the physical symptoms stopped, the happiness never came back. I never really felt fully myself again. My chronic pain kept getting to me. etc etc. Opiates are the only thing that help my injury/spinal related pain and because of my age it's fucking impossible for me to get anything from doctors. I'm a metalhead with all sorts of piercings, i'm 24, every doctor automatically assumes i'm drug seeking and is hesitant to give me anything at all. I used to go to a Pain management clinic and got 120 5mg vics and 60 10mg oxycodones per month but I stopped taking those and moved out of stated years back and haven't been able to set up a new plan with a new doctor. Either every doctor is too pussy footed to help me because my age/appearance makes me look like a drug seeker, despite my documented medical history, or, I just lost the patience to deal with the health care system and give up trying to get relief through the normal routes. 

So I just started ordering from the darknet over a year ago. 

Everything is functioning perfectly in my life. And has been solidly for 12 months straight. 

I never use H for more than 10 days out of each month. And use kratom for maintenance to not have to deal with WDs and to be able to kill pain at the same time. 

Sometimes you just need something stronger to feel good/really get at the pain. 

It's just so good to be honest. All those years where H was destroying my life and now I've got it by the reigns. 

I know that everyone's going to tell me it's a dangerous game and that sooner or later i'll fall through the cracks, but i've been there already, and I sincerely don't see it happening. Because every time I've been unable to afford it, well, that's it, I just can't afford it and I move on and wait a few more weeks til I can. 

All my bills are paid and current. I've been successfully paying off debt, and now through all of this, i'm also able to get my beautiful girlfriend the engagement ring she deserves. 

I just want to say thank you to all the amazing people on this sub, you guys are amazing and I absolutely love seeing and sharing all the stories we post here. This is my second home and has been for years. 

So with all that said. I just wanted to say I'm pain free, high as a kite, and going to be able to enjoy my memorial day weekend to the fullest. I wish every single one of you the best this weekend, and every other day moving forward. 

I never thought i'd make it this far and accomplish so much, and I know there is so many more of you out there who feel/felt the same way. Don't let that doubt consume you. You can do it. Whether you're detoxing, or trying to successfully balance an opiate usage and a ""normal"" life, it's possible, and you can find success.

If you're the kind of addict I am, you lead a life where the vast majority of people you interact with on a day-to-day basis will never understand or relate to some of the feelings and actions that absolutely drive us, and that we feel every day. 

There are some that are pretty commonly mentioned here, like when you are too sick to even fucking move but man hits you with that ""gud cum thru"" and you suddenly can not only drive, but expertly weave through traffic like Speed Racer racing on speed. I wanna know: what are some of those less talked-about opi feels that you think we can relate to? I have a couple off the top of my head.

1. Itching the SHIT (heh) out of your anus directly. Either with toilet paper protection, or just saying fukkit and going in like me before a eye-opening run-in with the Gon-Tron: bareback and unafraid with extensive washing after. Goddamn feels so GOOD.

2. Eating not because you're hungry, but because you just threw up so you know to enjoy more gear you're gonna need to shove *something* down your raw gullet. I'm doing this right now with some dank Chinese food. And I'm not talkin like a stoner, y'all...

Is it possible to purify or further isolate heroin in #4 form? I just received several gs of heroin that seems to be cut with a stimulant-like substance. 

I don't think it's another drug like meth or cocaine, because there's no euphoria with the rush. It simply increases my heart rate and throws me into a near-panic attack. I have a bad anxiety disorder, and the best way to describe it is like smoking weed, if weed makes you anxious and paranoid like it does me, with a hugely elevated heart rate. 

I have heard of a common cut that feels like a stimulant before, but I can't remember what it's called. 

I'm hoping there's a way to isolate the dope but I am already pretty certain you can't do that without some advanced lab equipment, haha. I know you can sometimes purify it and separate it from the non-soluble cut, but this is probably a different process?

I'll give you two blues if you come through and do it."" A couple of days later when I was finally able to come through and help, I spoke to Ben on the phone prior to verify some details. In fact, two nights earlier we also spoke on the phone. I asked him to clarify exactly what he wanted me to do to these phones for his sister.

Does the phones need to have a carrier unlock performed? As in, making an AT&T phone work on T\-Mobile or is there a passcode that he wishes to circumvent? That night he said, ""I'll call my sister, find out and call you back."" Two hours later... ""I guess you forgot about me, let me know if you can meet up tomorrow afternoon tot ake care of this.""

&nbsp;

Forgot about him? When we left off he said that he'd call me back to answer my two questions. The following day when we spoke, he did not have answers to those questions. So prior to coming over I told him that I didn't want to waste my time coming over only to find out there's nothing I can do nor do I want to come unprepared. He told me that he would pay me for my time regardless of the outcome.

&nbsp;

He said it, whether I fix it or not he will pay me what was initially promised to be two blues and a smoke\-up. When I got there he turned up with the wax so he fulfilled that part of the bargain. He also provided me with half a blue while I did my work.

&nbsp;

There is a third type of unlock which I did also try to find out about when we spoke on the phone the night before. Activation lock, or Find My iPhone \(FMIP\) lock which is practically impossible to circumvent. After a restore the device asks you to sign into iCloud, which cannot be bypassed.

&nbsp;

Mind you, when I spoke to this dude on the phone prior, he said he'd pay me whether or not I was successful but even if I was 100&#37; successful, he did not have two whole blues to give me on the spot. Maybe if I had succeded he would've gotten a credit from the person he gets blues from but I doubt it since he wasn't willing or able to do that with the guarantee I'd pay the following day.

&nbsp;

Thus instead of getting paid two blues, I got half a blue. Totally not worth my time. It was okay bonding time I suppose. I didn't cover Ben's melodrama, like when I told him I on the phone that I wanted more detail so that I wouldn't waste his time paying me to do something that couldn't get done. At the time he still assured me he'd pay me regardless and thanked for looking out and not scamming him by triyng to give him a heads up that paying me could very well be a waste since I didn't have enough info from him to know if I could do what was needed.

&nbsp;

Did these guys just see me as vulnerable? Was I too nice? I'm not a small girl, I can certainly look intimidating. I'm sure guys experience this shit too, but... Idk. Idk. 

Now I feel like I can trust no one. I've always felt that way, but never more than now. I'm so scared. I feel violated and angry and I want revenge.

While they were kicked out they were given access to the car and are still allowed to return to the house due to my parents fear of them being on the streets, however when he comes over he openly uses in the home and brings stolen merchandise that he spends his days/nights obtaining. He's not allowed to stay the night but it has happened as my parents invite him over during late hours where they don't stay up to enforce his removal. My brothers behavior remains toxic as he persistently questions my parents for money to ""help him out,"" and where his misplaced stolen merchandise may be. It was a almost impossible feat it felt to witness my parents finally muster the courage to kick him out of the house but my brothers incessant pestering of my parents for things they shouldn't have to deal with anymore seem to have allowed him to return to the home and allowed the toxic environment to continue. What should we do?

Here it is, I've successfully tapered down over 6 months of hard abuse, I went from using 6-8 of these caps in a day down to one of those caps lasting me 2 days and able to even skip a day or two between caps without feeling super sick instantly. 
I can say I'm done with it, I feel like I'm done with it, after getting on H I don't even think about oxy anymore, it doesn't do it for me anymore anyway as I don't like the itchy high it gives.
Over the weekend I'll use this as sparingly as possible and once it's done I am done. Hopefully forever. 
I've been testing the w/d boundaries and it looks like I'll be good since I'm on such a low dose just to maintain I can handle going without it without much discomfort. Last time I skipped 2 days beginning of this week and only got chills and sweats for an hour or two and they were mild, and some stomach cramping which a couple of lopes calmed right down. 
So I think I'm ready. Finally. I've read this sight for a few years, only posted a few comments, but it's given me a lot of information to figure out how to do this so thanks to all of you still here struggling, balls deep in the life or been out for years alike, keep helping those who want it and those who don't too.

I never stopped though... I'm truly sorry.

I don't know how big the addiction is atm. I'm 19. It appears that I'm physically addicted now, it's been more than a month daily and nearly 2 months since my first time. Had a longer withdrawal yesterday lasting about 24hrs and I had to take small doses before I ran out. I could barely breathe, walk, my entre body was hurting, especially my back and legs. My heart was going crazy.

I was psychologically addicted instantly as I quitted my alcohol+speed addictions and benzos which I started taking everyday with the alcohol and speed, right before I started with H. I have big problems with my mental health, never gotten any diagnosis, never been ""analysed/evaluated"" by a therapist though.

During my withdrawal yesterday, I lost my cash with no dope, my girlfriend nearly broke up during a phone call. I was so pumped with adrenaline and turned extremely aggressive, I strongly felt like started destroying everything around me. It was bad, I was not myself. It seemed like a mild psychosis.

Nowadays I put heroin as my top priority. Fuck eating/drinking. Fuck sleep. Fuck taking a shower. Fuck school (Dropped out, before H though). Fuck meeting friends. Fuck having a normal life.

Fuck everything, I need to get some fucking heroin first!

Then I can try focus on getting my life together..

Wait, fuck, I need to get cash before I go empty in 3 days. Busy life I see.. At least I can get some relief in all this..

I honestly don't know what to do anymore. If I quit H, I'll just feel like shit and still have my mental problems, which H can ""cure"", at least for now. I'll fall back on a big growing polydrug addiction which is way more damaging in my eyes, and those aren't even that effective.

Also cops, detective and a drug dog in the story. Lol","So I take my buddy to go pickup. I'm doing well with 5 days clean, the worst physically is over but problems sleeping and mental cravings are still driving me crazy. But I persevered and gave my buddy a ride because I owed him some money, I give him a ride in exchange for the owed money and resisted temptation even after him offering to get me high which was a small victory for myself but that's neither here nor there, the copping process is where it got interesting.

As we're sitting at the spot waiting for his dude, it's on the corner of X and X when I noticed this blacked out Impala drive past the next block over for the second time. I mention it to my buddy but we blow it off. It's happened so many times while picking up, probably just another coincidence. At this point we've got two cars ahead of us, generally dude has everyone meet up at the one way street on X and X somewhere throughout the city in an orderly line patiently waiting for the dope man. When he gets there he flashes his lights and we all follow. I've seen the lines get up to like 10 of us before depending on how many people he's got coming through but this particular instance it's just the three of us and I was at the back of the line. He pulls up, flashes and we all follow. He turns into an alley a block or so away and one by one like a drive through people pull up, place there order and hand over the money and pull off waiting for another call. It's generally just a minute or so later the call comes in to meet at X which is usually pretty close to the last spot. We go there and again same cars ahead of us pulling up to the new car, grabbing their dope and driving off. Quick transactions, very professional and punctual dudes like they're running a business. 

You may think this system is convoluted or just inconvenient but it saves his crews ass while one collects money and the amount needed then alerts the next guys around the corner and has them meet and distribute the dope. He never handles the money the other guy never has dope on his hands. I think it's a rather sophisticated and well setup business practice and has never been an inconvenience for myself or anyone else I know that goes through dude. 

Now the blacked out impala from earlier, I'm driving back and I get just out of the neighborhood when metropolitan police SUV rolls up out of know where and flips on the berries and cherries no sooner than I spot him in the rear view. I'm calm, sober and not in possession of any drugs so I'm not really sweating it other than potentially having a warrant from a previous incident. But my buddy just bought $50 worth of caps, having already snorted two he eats the remaining 8 to avoid possible jail time and he's lucky he did. 

The pig comes up and immediately asks where the heroins at and that she's bringing the dog so just give it up now. I'm good and have nothing to worry about so I calmly tell mrs piggy there are no drugs on me or in my vehicle and asked if I was being detained or if I could please go. She's pissy, tells me I'm being detained until back up and the dog arrives. She continues to interrogate me saying she knows I just bought heroin and that they've been investing this particular area for heroin use and I just tell her I don't do drugs and we're hear to meet a man about a pit bull puppy. My buddy and I are on the same page and that's the story we'd come up with a year ago in case a situation like this arose. We rehearsed it again before even speaking with the cop this time around to be sure. 

The canine finally arrives along with two more cruisers. So at this point we've got the initial female cop, the cop with the canine and two more male cops. Four in total for absolutely nothing but they're ready for shit to hit the fan apparently. While the the dog is doing his job going to through every inch of my vehicle they separate my buddy and I and try interrogating us again hoping one will slip up about something incriminating.  This is when the blacked out impala pulls up. Detective Dickstash, I'm assuming he was a detective anyway he was dressed and acted different than the regular metropolitan police, he walks up and immediately starts being an asshole. He tells me they're investigating a dealer in the area and I'm going down if I don't start cooperating, which I'd been 100% cooperative prior to his arrival. I tell him the same thing I told the rest, stick to your story. Don't budge an inch. If they catch you lying or discrepancies in your stories you're just asking for trouble. 

Finally they give up on the dog search as he doesn't hit on anything or find anything but he did manage to destroy my work truck in the process which is always nice. We get one last lecture from the remaining pigs and are told to stay out of the area, if we're caught over here again we're in trouble blah blah same bullshit they always say. As things are wrapping up the detective or whatever come back and isn't being a prick now saying he's just trying to get the ""big fish"" and he saw us and other cars in the area buying drugs, that he knew our story was bullshit but they didn't have anything on us so we were free to go but too again, stay the fuck away from that neighborhood or else blahmuuu

All in all, it wasn't the worst experience I've had with city police, having just wasted and hour of our time and no one went to jail this time. My buddy immediately called up ol boy and told him the pigs were onto them and he said he'd received a call from someone else who was pulled over and went through the same ordeal.

**No,  I'm  not talking about all drug or opiate addicts/""junkies"".  I'm basically a junkie myself, you could say I was a junkie long before I ever tried heroin. But I'm sick of all the bullshit associated with lots of drug users.**

Ever since I started with heroin, things have really went downhill. It's the most effective drug at treating my struggles of all that I've tried, and I never get fucked up, just take enough for my pains to go away. I've started to get withdrawals and it'¬®s been hell all day. But I have a female junkie friend \(who's 20 years older than me and she's homeless, living in a homeless shelter\). She appears very trustworthy, but every time she's been helping me get H, I usually end up scammed/robbed. First time I got scammed, I got 0,6g when I bought 1,2g \(always weigh my shit\), she gave me half of what I bought. She told me that she got scammed too, and that it wasn't her fault in any way, we went with one of her friends.

Then I got a number from her to meet a friend of her to buy from, it turns out she was a crackhead, and she didn't even sell dope, she took my cash and never came back outside. \(If only I had seen where she went inside..\) My junkie\-friend told me it was my fault. \(Yes, sorry that I actually trust people, learned from those mistakes by now.\)

I tried buying it off the street an early morning after a roll, because I didn't have any H left. Met an amph\-guy who claimed to be selling heroin as well when I asked him. Guess what? I got speed, a weird brown powder and not H. Barely any speed at that weight, but at least I got some fucking drugs that time at least. I ended up smoking all the speed mixed with a brownish powder \(Which wouldn't even melt. I put it on foil, I even literally put it inside a flame and it simply turned black, no smoke. Didn't work shit, although I continued to smoke the whole thing desperately, of course, with the result of having the worst speed I've ever consumed in my system.

Today I met up with my junkie\-friend, we were both dopesick and was going to get some dope together, although of course she brings in other people she knows, and I have to wait for hours. Finally I meet her again, and she's with a girl, and they tell me that her friend's boyfriend ran off with all the money. This time I just KNEW something like this would happen. I was asking if she could join me and sell half a gram of speed to get enough for dope, however she talked about letting her sell it for me and meeting up with her when she had the dope she was going to get with another friend.

She also demanded her old phone back, which I borrowed from her because my last one broke.

At this point we were waiting for her friend. I had enough and simply left her. I knew wouldn't get my dope or cash back anyways, so I went home instead of waiting with her like an idiot while being sick as fuck.

I stood there alone with nothing left except a little weed and half a gram of amphetamine. I've quitted speed, so I didn't want to take it at all. But when I got home, I just said fuck it and took a couple of lines, some weed and a drink to calm down, but I found two 30mg codeine pills too, so all this made me feel a little better temporarily.

Things got a little better however, as I was lucky enough to get a new phone from insurance because the last one broke. I borrowed some cash from a good \(real\) friend, and called a dealer \(which I bought from once, he had the greatest shit I've tried so far, much better than what I've bought from my junkie  ""friend"". I have a huge suspicion that she's been cutting the heroin to make a profit, heroin that's already cutted to hell. Some days ago, I actually tasted speed from some part of the dope I was smoking, and it's funny how I traded speed4dope with her some days before that..\), not expecting him to answer as I've attempted to call him numerous times since I met him the first time. He was my only choice other than the junkie or buying off the streets.

He answered though, he asked who I was and I told him we met before. He was available and he told me he had very, very good dope this time, though it would be more expensive because of that. To afford it, I offered to give him my cash and 0,4g of speed. He actually accepted my offer, and I met him along with two of his buds, and the deal was done in under 5 minutes. I asked if I could just call whenever I need to buy, and he said yes. I've just taken a little bit so far, and it feels much better than what I've tried before.

I've made the decision that I won't deal with \-that\- kind of junkies anymore. Not my ""friend"" either. If she has no blame in all this, and she also got robbed/scammed those times, I still have to leave. She's dragging me into so much bullshit, she won't even give me any numbers to dealers. She wants me to get my dope through her.

I'm done with her anyways. And I'm fucking done losing all my cash and getting sick. From now on I'll have to do this solo. And a drug deal is supposed to last less than 5 minutes, not fucking 5\+ hours of waiting

Recently though, i lost my job. And with it my health insurance. My sub dr is in another state and im on 16mg a day. So shit got spendy fast incredibly fast.

Ive had to resort to wheelin and dealin with other sub patients to make ends meet and not be sick.

This week i was 2 days short to my refill. I didnt wanna spend both days sick. Im waiting to start a new job i really need and the second all my stuff comes back theyll likely tell me to come to work now in the same phone call. So im trying to be somewhat well in case that happens too.

I could not find shit this time around as far as bupe goes. My only options were dope, methadone, or go sick. Fuck going back to dope. I really didnt wanna be sick. So......

I broke down and bought 2 10mg methadones. I dont have much experience with the done at all. I live in rural midwest so there hasnt been a clinic near me that does anything but subs. So ive never really had the choice. Ive been okay with that till these last 2 days.

Even just 10mg done a day had me feeling better than the subs. I wasnt so bogged down by a high dose. Having energy was nice. I didnt get sick for a considerable amount of time which was surprising. And most of all i didnt have any cravings. Thats something ive never been able to achieve with subs. I was talking to the dude i got them from and i guess theres a clinic doing done 20 miles from me. Which aint too bad to drive.

I know its a full agonist and all that pharmacology. So i dont need that all explained to me. I just want some personal testimony i guess. Anyone spend a long time as an addict (10+ years) do better on methadone than subs?

Now that i have the option mear me, Im leaning towards switching both for price and efficacy",1527205021.0

Or is it just me?,"I fell in love with opiates since extracting opium from poppies I grew a while back, I joined this sub thinking it may be a place to share knowledge and experiences. But I came and it seems everyone is hooked. 

Personally I found opium and other opiates to help me learn how to feel uninhibited pleasure outside of taking anything. I learnt a lot from opiates. And when I see people struggle it hurts.

I asked myself how people could get so hopelessly addicted to these things and why I had not fallen into it after using on and off for a while and only really experiencing positives. Outside of withdrawal.. which I don‚Äôt allow my use to ever get to..

Then i realized most addicts don‚Äôt take psychedelic drugs.

I used mushrooms on occasion as a reset. Whenever I fall into any addictive behaviour I take a large dose of mushrooms and get healed. Sounds silly. But going into psychedelic experiences with true intent can be a life saver. I am addiction free. I take mushrooms a couple times a year. And I rarely use opiates. Now and then I take Kratom. Rarely ever two days in a row.

I‚Äôm not trying to sound conceited, but I just want to offer this piece of advice to others. If you are an addict. Take mushrooms. At least 4-5grams

It‚Äôs helped me with my addictive behavior and I‚Äôm sure it could help many of you. Opiates are incredible. But nothing compared to being free of cravings",1527196531.0

Or should I try to beat the test, but my options are limited, I have no one to find to get clean pee, and no time to order anything online. Can quick cups be beat by pouring something else in them like water or juice/soda??**   


*My anxiety is through the roof right now.*    



**edit**: I just realized I have a first check drug test I could be experimenting with but I‚Äôm so scared of finding out I‚Äôm screwed. Would I test it by just seeing if I piss dirty, or use it to see if pouring tap water in my pee would work, or anything of the sort. I even thought of getting my little brother‚Äôs pee from the toilet, since he usually doesn‚Äôt flush, but it would be very diluted, and he‚Äôd have to pee sometime soon, should I get his toilet pee if I have the chance?

I went for small bumps till i was suuper dizzy and feeling not good, not horrible, just ""meh...""

Then I decided to go out and try luck on the street. 3 times. No luck. I swap between chasing the dragon to snorting to chase it again.., nothing. Just dizzy and feeling... ""meh...""

Why is this? I mean... I know the feeling from heroin must be fucking awesome but why i just didnt feel it..., I tried it more than 5 times already and didnt ""unlock"" that feeling... 

I dont believe I am super man or something, either i have a natural high opiate tolerance. I just feel like ""why I just can¬¥t feel it when other people says the first time is the best one and you want to chase it forever but you cant..."".

Went where the junkies hang out, offered a dude a few bucks to take me to his guy. It's not too hard to tell who the dealers are, but I figure the dealers are going to be a little more comfortable selling if I'm with some locals than if some strange white boy walks up and asks to buy drugs.

Dude is stoked to make a few bucks and obviously is gonna hustle a couple bags as the middle man. Whatever, cost of doing business, as long as I save some time and I'm not wandering aimlessly around the block when the neighborhood is crawling with police.

Another dude chases us down and starts bitching about the fact that the first guy is taking me to a different dealer. Starts putting his hands on me and trying to pull me one way. A third guy sees the incident and starts pulling me another way, trying to sell me crack which I don't want.

I decide to keep following the dude I threw a few bucks. The black dude with the crack wanders off, the bearded Latino dude follows me and the junkie I asked to help me out in the first place and harasses him, telling the dude he owes him and acting all hurt he was taking me to buy off someone else.

At this point, the Latino dude has been keeping his hands on me. I got bad vibes from him but I trust the other junkie to at least take me to get decent dope even though he's gonna try and lie about prices so he can score a couple bags for himself on my dime.

Some other dude on the street walked up next to me, shook his head, and whispered ""walk with me"" and started trying to make like we knew each other. This confirmed my bad vibes about the Latino dude that was insistent on coming with us. He threatened to fuck the good Samaritan up, and we kept walking. I decided that in terms of strength, not to mention possible weapons, trying to ditch the dude with his hands on me would be more likely to result in personal injury and legal trouble than if i kept walking.

My faith in the junkie I asked to introduce me to his guy was well placed enough. I got what I needed, it was the strongest I've ever had, and the price would have been alright if he hadn't tried to give me half of what I paid for because I looked suburban. No big deal there, I got a number and a few corners I can try without arousing too much suspicion.

Sketchy Latino dude tells me the middle man gave him some stamps to pay him back for something, then he hands them to me and demands that I pay him for the stamps... which were originally purchased with my money. I tell him I have no cash left on me and tell him to go settle his dispute with the middle man himself. He gets bent out of shape, starts demanding $20, and then throws a brick at the guy from earlier who was trying to get me away. He insists we go to an atm and I figure I'd rather just pull $20 out of an ATM than deal with this crackhead in a neighborhood I don't know.

Needless to say, we hit the ATM, he reaches over and types in $200 on the ATM while I'm trying to pull out money, grabs my money and my card out of the machine, and tells me he's gonna hook me up with some bundles since the other guy skimmed a few bags off of me. We're I not holding at the time, I would have started swinging at the guy when he reached over and punched in a different number while I tried to take out money, but at this point I'm now holding and from out of town, so a brawl that doesn't end with a quick knockout is going to end with me going to jail when the locals back his story over mine.

Where it gets fucking bizarre, is that he spent the next two hours wandering around knocking on doors, making calls, and insisting he would get me more dope while holding onto my atm card. My dumb ass, reluctant to let my atm card walk, followed him around while he tried to pull out more money, not realizing the card was locked out for suspicious activity. He bought me dinner, kept promising his guy would meet us in ten minutes, and I got a couple other phone numbers and samples from dudes that told me this guy was a dickhead.

I figured that humoring the dude was the smartest call because he couldn't pull any more money out and if I hung around long enough I'd at least get the card back, and he had already exhibited violent tendencies anyway. As far as I was concerned, anything I could have done to set him off would draw attention from LEO and put me at risk.

In either case, I'm out $200 and I don't think the bank will reimburse it even though the withdrawals were under implied duress and he memorized the pin code and made the actual withdrawal.

I cannot for the life of me figure out why he would waste so much time acting like he was trying to get me a couple bundles, buy me a meal, and then hand my card back to me if he was just trying to rob me. There's a part of me that's quietly distraught that he might have actually been the world's shittiest dope dealer and that I might have gotten so fed up with the bullshit that I just left him with my money moments before the drugs arrived because his friend texted me that ""he's got your stuff"" shortly after I left.

Should I just block the number and hope I never see the dude again? Return with a couple friends and a tire iron? Feel the situation out? Report the card stolen?

And did I do the right thing by not causing a scene while I was holding? I feel like a pushover for letting him grab my money and for hanging around as if he would actually deliver... but the alternatives seemed excessively risky.

Anyway folks, hopefully my misfortune was of some amusement to you. I just finished off the last remnants of what I picked up that night so I wouldn't figure that the narrative is super clear. In either case, I hate being away from home, shit is so easy where I live. The different organizations have their different corners, no one yells to try and get your attention or steal your business from a competitor, buying drugs is a fucking simple, civilized, quiet process.",1527111595.0

I take it as one dosage in the morning. I got my hand on a box of oxy's (fast working version, 5 mg a tablet). I am aware of the dangers of combing the oxy and benzo's, but seen most of the effects of the clonazepam are gone in the evening, eventho it's still in my blood due the long halftime, is there a way for me to take oxy recreationally? Like taking a low dosage or so? I have little to zero tolerance when it comes to opiates, and a huge benzo tolerance. Despite my low tolerance, I know what to expect when it comes to opiates, seen I used to do codeine, tramadol and oxy some years ago.

I realize the markup and $ they make is 1000 fold if sold as heroin, not to mention the idiots who ""would never fuck with fent""(spoiler alert, that's all you've been doing for a few years now).... but there WOULD BE a market for it pure or close to pure.

Diane hemmed and hawed and finally said, ‚ÄúOh, I don‚Äôt know, give me a blue and a couple of sixteenths.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou damn right.‚Äù

Dropped that habit for about 4 months then hopping right back in with 82.5 mgs of hydrocodone. That led me to picking up the dilaudid habit again. I shortly afterwards started IM the dilaudid to get a better bioavailability. I did that for 6 months or so then I was desperate one night and IVed 4 mgs and was surprised that it pinned my pupils. Payday came shortly afterwards and then I IVed the whole 8mg pill and that was it. The rush with the pins and needles felt amazing. Now I‚Äôm 6 months down the line with that and all I do is IV now.

So ive been smoking for idk, like a month or two now.

NOW due to this i have no tolerance but i still find it hard to get the desired high i want from my tar...  here are some questions im sure you geniuses would love to answer for me. Thanks and happy noddin

1. How much should I put on my foil when i smoke, i usually put .01 to .1 at mosttttt, now should i be putting more onto the foil and is that why I'm not getting super high?

2. Now my tar neverrr rolls. It never leaves a trail it just turns to ash
 ((( I have decent tar most of my sacs I THINK    
  i usually get anywhere from .2 to 1g depending on how long i want it to last AND the quality differs mildy,)))  
 but is this because off the quality of my tar?? Or could it pretain to my previous question and just be solved by putting more

3. I also usually smoke some h... wait a minute and smoke some weed. Then before i go to bed like an hour to 2 later i smoke h again. Is this a good strategy or am i literaly just blowin threw my stash to not feel any more euphoria by redosing.

I have been doing codeine for 9 months straight once a week already \(and still not addicted, no withdrawals or anything if i skip a dose. Must be lucky or something\)

Anywho, i was looking for a way to potentiate the codeine i have. Tried looking up for some gluthimide substitutes and if they're available, but to no avail. Next best thing that won't kill ya is dexamethasone, so i made up a bullshit story for the pharmacists about an asthma emergency and bought 10x 0,5mg strip for about 2 euros, extracted my dose of codeine and was prepared for a trip, but lost a strip of antihistamines i had, but since i've been doing this for quite a while the histamine reaction didn't really affect me all that much anymore except for the regular itch here and there, so thought i could take it. Boy was i about to have a really unpleasant experience:

1st attempt

6:00am \- drank 3 dexamethasone tablets

7:30am \- drank 2 dexamethasone tablets

the only reason i've did this is that i read sketchty reports that dexamethasone can take anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours to work, so i thought i'll space it out to get the enzymes working the most they can.

8:00am \- drank codeine with some sodium carbonate water \(to remove acids from stomach, so more gets to the digestive tract\)

8:10am \- feeling the opiate come up, damn, doesn't usually start this fast.

8:30am \- the histamine reaction came in

9:00am \- by now this was the worst histamine reaction i've experienced ever, period, it felt like i was walking on needles. My entire ARM was bloated, the itching was unbearable.

9:10am \- found a clemestine tablet, drank it. Thank God.

the itching subsidied after half an hour, and the high kinda remained. I couldn't really appreciate it a lot due to the itching and me disregarding anthisitamines, but you could say that the unusual histamine reaction i had was a tip off that it worked.

The opiate hight lasted somewhere until 11:00am, then i took a few gabapentin capsules and nodded the rest of my day, going about my usual business/band practices and socializing. Was a wonderful day overall.

2nd attempt

Took 5 days off for my tolerance to reset to see if i had the same results, this time lowering dexamethasone intake for control

11:00pm \- took 1 dexamethasone tablets

12:00pm \- took another one, same as above

12:30pm \-  took codeine with some antacids, and took 1 cetirizine tablet with it

12:45pm \- again, codeine kicks in WAY faster than before. Holy shit the rush is amazing

13:00pm \- went on a date, bought some extra codeine while high on codeine for the future, heh

15:00pm \- high ended, took some gabbies to enhance the afterglow and went on my day socializing as usual \(that's usually the only reason i take oppies tbh\)

I took a much lesses dose this time, the rush was really simmilar, but the high didn't last as long as the first one. Can't tell if it was due to the dexamethasone or my natural bodies phenomenon \(you know, with the codeine being a prodrug and all\)

Verdict: Dexamethasone did potentiate my codeine, for what it's worth. Tt gave a much stronger rush and extended it's action by a bit, quite noticeably than the last time i did codeine without it. If i had to give it an estimae on how much it improved the trip overall it would be somewhere around 15\-20&#37; but now i need another control group after this experience. Can't say that it did miracles, though. If you're really in a pinch and need to make the best out of the opiate supply you've got then have no doubt \- dexamethasone does work. But if you have a choice and getting opiates is less of a problem/not that expensive \( a 300mg pack of codeine costs 2,30 euros for me\) then i would just recommend getting more opiates, since opiates don't really have a ceilling dose, contrary to popular belief. \+ dexamethasone might be able to cause nasty side effects if taken long term, since it's an immunosupressant, so i wouldn't recommend it as a long term solution.

Regardless of the outcome, i will get back to ya'll on this quite soon, since i'm gonna try codeine without the dexamethasone after a break to see if i still get the same rush \(can't rule out the possibility of a strong placebo, brain does work wonders when ya biased\)",1527024457.0

First things first, I'm a 26 y/o male residing in canada. The only time i had ever taken opiates in my life is when I crashed my motorcycle at 20 y/o, the hospital i was transported to gave me 5 percocets for the pain for the next few days \(5/325\). Never went out of my way to find more but when buddies had some percs i would take them occasionally.   


 Fast forward about two years later, I tore my knee apart. Grade 3 MCL tear, ACL tear and Meniscus tear. Docs gave me tramadol for the pain when it first happened but they made me feel sick and didn't really help the pain. They gave me a script for 30 more percocets until i could get into surgery. Had the surgery and was sent home with 50 more percocets. I was in so much pain i had to take 2\-3 every 4 hours just to be able to tolerate it. I would even wake up in the middle of the night in so much pain so i would reach for the bottle and take another 2\-3 and go back to sleep.   


Pain started to subside after around a month and i was walking better but still hurt as they said it would take a few months for the pain to fully go away. It never went away and now i am looking at early onset arthritis in my knee which isn't uncommon for these types of surgeries and knee injuries. I then was given a monthly prescription for the same percocets. 60/month and was instructed to use them only when i needed them. \(we all know how this goes\)  


Well i didn't use them when I only needed them for pain, i started using them all the time taking up to 10 \-12 per day. They didn't last long. I had to get blood work done and my tests came back i had a high liver enzyme which was due to my excessive drinking and painkillers. Stopped drinking completely but still lied and complained to my doc that my knee still hurt \( it still did hurt but not nearly as much as i was telling him\) He then put me on more oxycodone 10Mg without the acetaminophen in hope to help my liver. This is where it started to get worse and worse.    


Since there was no APAP in these ones, i started to sniff them. Sniffing one, swallowing one. Multiple times a day. Doc filled up my script twice and when i went back to Go see my doctor for the third time he had had retired i guess or moved but the receptionist didn't care to elaborate. The new doc \(younger female dr that looked like she just got out of med school\) will not prescribe me anymore and was frankly surprised and angry that i have been taking so many and my previous doctor would even allow me to get that many. \(here in canada it seems like they are way more stingy to prescribe oxy now after all of the abuse.\) They even switched most of the oxy to Oxyneo to help battle the abuse here. Cant get them prescribed so turn to the streets, found some 20mg oxys from a plug and he had upwards of 300 of them. I must have bought at least 150 of them to last me a while and now they have finally ran out . He can't get more of them and i do not trust anyone else because of the recent fent pills going around in my city.    


Im going to attempt to stop doing them all together, After being on them for more than 14 months and usually averaging 60\-80mg a day I'm concerned with how my W/D are going to be. Ive never battled withdrawals from opiates because I've been on them daily for a year straight. I have battled withdrawals from alcohol when i was drinking a litre or more of vodka a day for around 8 months and those were absolutely horrible, it felt like i would feel better if i was dead than having to deal with them.  


I am legitimately scared on how these W/D are going to be, I'm scared I'm going to relapse and buy tainted pills or something because of the feeling of being unwell.   


TL;DR \- Docs got me hooked on oxy after surgery, haven't been able to stop but going to try and attempt to stop tomorrow.",1527022225.0

8lczhr,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8lczhr/it_has_not_been_a_long_week/,11,https://redd.it/8lczhr,sloan_fitch,It has [not] been a long week,"It's been a long week. That's what I would be saying if I was still doing stupid things. Last week I got paid, had to pay one $80ish debt and then had the rest of my money left for bike parts and incidentals. Cliff was hoping and expecting me to get subs but I didn't put any effort in or even share any of my own this time. He was given the option to fund subs for himself a number of times prior but he kept postponing and decided to spend his money on other things. If I share any subs with him or loan him any with my own money, I'm basically sending the message that it's okay to have no foresight and rewarding such behavior. Furthermore, he certainly wouldn't pay me back with subs or cash. If I'm attempting to follow my own recovery program, trading my personal supply of subs for roxies is probably not a good idea. It's not conducive to recovery.

Cliff is looking forward to script day, and will likely get someone else to pick up the script in order to be able to get someone with a car to pick up multiple bottles of soda among other necessities. I've made it pretty clear I'm not interested, that I don't want to get in on that script.

He'll want to graciously give me two free pills and knowing that I can't just have two will offer to lend me more until pay day. He already did. He has to go to the doctor on Wednesday and pick up the script on Saturday. If I do get in on this, I'll reset my suboxone taper just because of one day of partying and by partying I mean doin pills that aren't even as good as dope. If I'm gonna do something ""bad"", I might as well do it right. Then of course I would be indebting myself the following week. If I owe Cliff $100, he'll surely ask to borrow a little more. Why even bother putting myself in that position?

Last time I got pills, it sucked. I ate a couple, snorted a bunch and tried to finish all of them before too late and just got sick from it. Not terribly sick just nauseous and ughish. I do so love not being entangled in the various games that come with the territory. I wouldn't have a solid taper schedule or supply of subs if I didn't stop going along with all of the bullshit games and listenign to my instincts. I couild have shared subs with Cliff numerous times since last week but it's not like he cared to get them when he had the money.

So this coming week, he'll hope to get me on board to take on some 15mg roxies on loan but I don't see the value comapred to continuing my suboxone taper plan and getting as low as possible. It would be harder to say no if he was offering to loan me dope but the repercussions would be similar. We'll see how it pans out. I'm curous to hear what Cliff says to entice me to get on board. Surely, whatever he thinks I want to hear. Any time I appear serious about clocking out of the game and being running partners with Cliff, he ups his offers. Like that time where he offered me a half a bun to bike to the ATM with his card instead of the normal .2 of a bun he offered prior.

So I can go on, get loaned some pills this Saturday and put myself behind by $100 before pay day. Alternatively, I can keep taking my subs, get below 2mg.. keep it going. Of course as far as Cliff is concerned I have nothing. No dope, pills or subs. If he asks how I'm doing so well, I'll just tell him I took a fist full of DXM \(which I do have stocked up\) even though I'm still on subs. If he thinks I have none, he can't ask me or beg me for any in his time of need.

I am carefully rationing my supply. I have a couple of those old people pill cases with compartments for the days of the week and I found my late mother's pill cutter which allows me to get clean and fairly precise cuts of Suboxone pills down to 1/8 size. The compartmental case allows me to physically plot my daily dosage, sort of like a physical representation of a spreadsheet. To top things off, I got my hands on two fresh 8mg strips from another friend for some weed. 

So I'm looking forward to following through and facing what comes my way. I don't think I'll get paid enough to be able to waste it on dope so I'm trying to avoid considering that option for next week's pay day. I bought some nitric oxide to back me up in order to prcent symptoms of ""stage fright"" for when I attract women in the comming weeks. That's for another post, and I've already wrote part of it but I'm finalizing the science, research and empirical results for said post.

You know, there have just been times where I get invited to a bar to see some friends and decline because I don't have money left over after buying dope. I'm just really happy though, that I am not scraping along. If I didn't have subs, I'd be seeking a variety of means to get some relief and would have no money to do it. That's why I stocked up on subs and DXM. I still haven't used DXM for anything but a cold but the theory of use makes sense. 

Shit, I still have to fix up a power cord for Cliff's Macbook before script day. If I don't he'll remind me and say ""paid for this computer in full"", yes for once he paid for something. Of course his carelessness is overlooked. When I loaned him a second spare power cord \(one in shit condition because I wasn't going to let him ruin a good one\) I told him he needed to take good care of it and he assured me he would. That he doesn't throw the computer at the floor or do anything to damage or wear out the power cord. Then there was that last time he was barred out and I literally saw him toss the plugged\-in Macbook onto the floor. Point is, many people will promise and claim they take care of shit when they obviously don't. I'm taking my time fixing the power cord because I want it to sink in that it's his fault, not mine and that if he doesn't take care of his shit that next time he'll have to wait an eternity to get it fixed.

It's like when someone spills soda on a laptop, then it works for two days and when it stops two days later you blame the soda but the user is like ""but it worked after I spilled soda on it."" :::face palm::: .... \(corrosion, and science\) Beyond that, Cliff's house is a pile of garbage, not conducive to taking good care of shit. Well maybe ""shit"", because there's plenty of places for his dog to shit. There's brown spots all over his floor where dog shit was picked up, there are other areas where he advises, ""watch your step"" and the electricity is still turned off. Cable TV is back on but power has been out for over two weeks. His house smells more like raw garbage as the humidity rises and I wouldn't even want to open his refrigerator. 

Then there's the bed bugs, if I keep doing dope and keep hanging out with Cliff frequently, I'll just get bed bugs in my house again. I already had thwarted a close call last year and I don't want to repeat that shit. I got very lucky and acted fast. Now, every time I go to Cliff's house I go through a decontamination procedure. No matter how tired I am, DECON! Luckily I haven't hung out at Cliff's in the past couple of weeks, between my business and his lack of drugs. When Cliff is dope\-sick, or has nothing to take after the worst of it is over, he just stays in his bed and watches TV. His mom likely yells at him from across the house, things like ""did money man come over yet?"" Cliff often lies about other people owing him money to be delivered to appease his mom and then pushes the goal post up when she remembers. 

Shit, I don't remember what I wanted to share with you readers... I guess I just wanted to check in and say that I'll put a little more effort into following my recovery action plan than I have in the past. Partially due to financial constraints, but also because summer is approaching. All winter I told myself that's it's too cold to quit all opioids, that I'll do it in the spring. There may be anxiety and hyper\-algesia for some but the hardest thing aside from anxiety is the bite of the cold. Take the cold out of the equation, I can manage the rest with a good solid biking regiment. 

Hence the reason I must keep my costs down, so I can finish replacing worn components on my bike and upgrade it a bit. With said parts, I safely can do a thousand miles before the end of August. With every 10\-20 mile day of cycling, natural endorphins will  be produced. Hopefully I can repair the mis\-wiring of my brain and get back on track with other productive activities that make me happy.

I am a long term opiate addict. I am writing this to maybe help someone or inform them about my experience with the OTC drug loperamide. Loperamide is contained in Imodium, it is readily available. Three years ago I found myself in a bad situation facing impending withdrawal due to my source being cut off. Loperamide is an opiate that use to be scheduled and prescribed. Many think it just works in the GI tract and at low therapeutic doses it does just that. However when a large dose (30-60mg depending) is taken it will cross the blood brain barrier causing it to permeate and become centrally acting. It will take every withdrawal symptom away. I thought it was miraculous that I could spend eight bucks for 200 and my opiate addiction was satiated. I continued to take loperamide for the past 3 years, never wanting to get high or take any other opiate. I found my use slowly escalating from 60mg to at its peak 190mg(80 pills). I started taking Xanax to lower my tolerance and ended up getting physically dependent on the benzo and my use escalated to an awful 20mg a day habit. I was able to cut down the lope to 70mg. A few months ago I began shooting H to transition from the long acting lope(which I only had to dose once a day, at the beginning only every other day). I was not able to fully become dependent on the H due to a situation that forced me to come clean about my use. I had tapered the Xanax down to 8mg a day. I ended up going to treatment. I was very precise and clear about the lope, which they had never treated. I spent 7 days in a detox unit being given phenobarbital(for the Xanax withdrawal) and suboxone for the opiate/lope withdrawal. I do not wish this on my worst enemy as it was pain and insanity simultaneously. I am writing this to warn people about long term lope use. It is been over 40 days since I checked in and am out. I have to take propanalol for my heart rate which is 145 when I wake up. I am still sweaty, depressed, GI issues, restlessness. It is akin to methadone withdrawal. I have wanted to get on suboxone but know it will prolong this dependency and I will eventually have to come off it. The neurotoxicity of lope has not been studied. My cognitive abilities are coming back but I fear for any permanent damage. Please stay away from loperamide as it is much harder than any opiate withdrawal I have been through. If you must use it to get out of withdrawal just use it sparingly. It will become a daily habit soon due to the availability and cost. Save yourself from the experiment I conducted on myself.

I was thinking maybe trying this with roxys with quarters and maybe halfs is this a more efficient way to do it you don't lose any and you don't get any dust in your lungs which is something I've been worrying about, obviously it's probably not a huge difference or anything im still going to do lines sometimes of whatever I'm doing but I was thinking this might be a healthier way to continue this journey of snorting bupe and roxys everyday to functionüòÖ I still got a few years left in me of this life",1526998110.0

I have detoxed at home 10\+ times from the opes but have never made it through a benzo withdrawal \(HELL\) without cracking....

I need to detox under medical supervision because I am seizure prone so it is very high risk for me to come off of benzos.. \(my doctor said it would literally kill me a lot easier than most people\)

I would like to rapid taper the opiates first then the benzos....

I have tapered both my benzo and opiate doses down below a 1/3 \(and switched from tar to kratom btw\) of what I was taking in January and I am dead set on getting clean!! I have been using both for more than 4 years btw and had other concurrent addictions that I have dropped a long the way... These are the last 2 habbits to drop, due to never being able to make it through how hellacious benzo withdrawals are...

I dont want to return to using drugs at all I really want to get clean!! I got rid of all friends who do drugs in my life and will be only placing myself in healthy environments in the future.

Ok I have a lot of questions:

How can I make the most out of this experience and set myself up for success??

Where the staff nice to you and helpful??

I want to be essentially anesthetized and unaware for the whole experience is it okay to tell the staff this???

Any tips going in?

I know what works well for myself in withdrawal \(baclofen, GHB, lyrica, marinal, ketamine, and soma\) can I give the this list or will they even listen to me?

Should I bring my own pills in I am scared they will screw me and just give me clonodine or some shit, if they don't help me enough I know myself, I will discharge myself, walk out and will have wasted my entire savings on a detox that: felt crappy, didn't even work, and be back to square 1 still addicted....

What should I bring to amuse myself in this setting?",1526997681.0

I don‚Äôt think it was near the severity of a medical emergency, as I was still able to squeeze out some turds around it, but I‚Äôm 100% sure of the diagnosis. Basically I could feel it in my colon for a week and a half, but couldn‚Äôt squeeze it out. 

I tried everything.  Miralax. Stool softeners. Suppository. Castor oil (I still gag thinking about that). Putting lube up my ass. Trying to reach a finger in there to break it up. NOTHING worked. It was starting to affect my quality of life. I was miserable. 

I was about to go to the doctor. Basically I had resigned myself to the fact that a medical professional was going to have to spelunk my asshole to break it down and get it out. The thought was terrifying. 

After countless hours of googling, I came across a recommendation for something called Oxy Powder. 

Sorry fellow junkies, despite the word ‚Äúoxy‚Äù in the name, it‚Äôs in no way related to a narcotic. 

I read that it breaks down hard and impacted stools, to serve its main function of cleaning out the digestive system. 

I figured what the hell, it can‚Äôt hurt. I‚Äôll try anything at this point. I ordered a bottle of 20 on Amazon, and paid the extra $5 for next day shipping. 

I ate 4 capsules last night, per the directions, along with a lot of water. 

I woke up this morning pessimistic, as I wasn‚Äôt feeling the urge to dump that the product description led me to believe I would be feeling. 

I lazily got a cup of coffee. Sat down. Wanted to cry, I was so uncomfortable. 

5 minutes later, the urge hit. I walked to the bathroom, saying a prayer to a God I‚Äôm not sure I believe in anymore. 

I sat down. And the magic happened. That rock hard turd slid out like toothpaste being squeezed out of the tube. It was still very hard and compact, but something was different. It actually moved. 

At first, I thought it was too good to be true. It must have been another load that once again made its way around the impaction. The only way to tell was to bear down, and squeeze those muscles together. 

I squeezed. I felt nothing. The large mass that was so uncomfortable, for so long, was no longer there. 

I cried. I shit you not. Legit cried. Tears of happiness. 

If you feel like you can‚Äôt clear that shit out, try OxyPowder. I won‚Äôt guarantee you that it will work. But I think it‚Äôs worth $10 to give it a shot. 

No, I do not work for them or endorse them in any official capacity. I‚Äôm just a junkie who couldn‚Äôt shit right. And OxyPowder saved my ass. Literally. ",1526996933.0

I'ma 28 year old male and have been doing opiates for about 11 years and recently started dabbling with fent presses. 
I have never been clean for more than 3 weeks in that time. 
It was never everyday for extended amounts of time because of money problems. I'm more of a binge addict because I have no problem taking 30 Roxie's In 3 days, bumping small amounts of fent and drinking and doing benzos. 
After that I may go a week til pay day with only weed and alcohol so I don't really know how physically addicted I am because the withdrawals aren't too bad, as long as there are a bunch of other substances.  No where near as bad as opanas or the months of poppy seed tea but that was years ago
 But I'm 100% mentally addicted.
To make things worse in November I broke my arm because I was skateboarding to the corner store on Klonopin and 32oz king kobra malt liquor and I was going to get more like an idiot half blacked out and I broke my elbow and coller bone 
since I don't have insurance I went to the Dr once after the er visit and the recommend a cast but because of insurance and money issues I left with an arm brace and and sixty 5 mg oxycodones and four 2 mg Dilaudid. I was never albe to go back to the Dr and now of course 6 months later I'm still in pain alot of daily pain and my elbow is messed up pretty bad and a friend's dad who was a foot Dr so not exactly his specialty but he said he would recommend it be rebroke and reset. 
Now adding being legitimately in pain daily and ruined my opiates usuage. I've started knowing buying fent pressed blue oxys because normal oxy does help and they are everywhere but of course because of money I don't do them daily.
I really want to some how get of some sort of replacement med. But I don't know if I have to go to the Dr after I use? Or can I go the week or 10-15 days I'm clean from opiates? 
Ive learned I'm powerless trying to quit with my own with kratom or gabapentin or pst or benzos and alcohol or anything and now that I have legitimate pain I have to take something to deal with the pain and i don't want to do fent pressed anymore  or opiate binges or my fingers going numb all the time and not being able to make a tight fist with alot of pain in my elbow. 
Do I have to be withdrawing to try and get these meds? I've taken subutex recently and I was able to make a whole one last 4 days and was never high and i was in zero pain and had zero urge to redose or even get high. I have taken 2 full ones before and got extremely high do I understand it can do that but that not what I want anymore. 
How should I go about getting something that will help me and I don't know if subutex or suboxe or methadone or what would be great or any at all. I just know the behavior I've been doing for 10 years plus needs to end but I can't deal with the pain sober. I'm not sure what or how to do anything.

Crashed my car while on 3 bars that I accidentally ate (started with one, then took 2 while almost blacked out),  Im stupid I know. Didnt get a dui thankfully. Please never drive blacked out, its dangerous as fuck.

 I got 5250d which is a 14 day hold. Stayed in a shitty looney bin for 6 days. All while bein givin 3 10 mg k56 every 4 hours. The MD‚Äôs at the looney bin were surprisingly script happy idk why. They even offered me morphine but I was aiming for getting 30s you feel me? It ended up being just the 3 10s but boy it would keep me happy :).6 days later I got transferred to a pretty sweet half ‚Äúrehab ‚Äú half psych house. The group sessions were boring but the spot was dope. Vig ass tv perfect for watchin the warriors jn the playoffs. 

Anyway, I cracked some ribs and broke my collarbone so Ive been givin like over 200 oxy over this time period. I know this because the psych md at the house pulled the ultimate homie move and moved me up to 40 mg every 4 hours or some shit! But the pharmacist at Kaiser denied it and that is how I know Ifound out from him that im the 200+ range...

I stayed in that house for a cool minute, sitting through group and personal therapy sessions about being sober and controlling your actions, all the while high on Oxy through all of it because of my dumbass injury lol,

I just got back out to the real world today and I got a job lined up and an appointment with my pcp. She said I wont be able to see pain management for a couple weeks atleast, and the appointment is going to be them 2 with me, which leads me to my question..

What is pain management like? I did a terribly fast google search and pee tests and pill counts came up. Anybody here with some advice on what I should do to make sure I get some good shit while telling them Im trying to ween off in like a month or so (i might need surgery idk yet). Should I just keep my mouth shut? Please share your experiences

That was hella long. Thanks for bearin with me. Pardon me for spilling my guys im just on zan plus some gaba and a couple percs . They dishcharged me today with 21 percs. 

Im 26 by the way, had cancer 2 years ago so I can claim I have experience in opiates. In reality I dont need them...

8l87ef,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8l87ef/addiction_is_it_really_a_disease/,53,https://redd.it/8l87ef,PassiveTactics,"Addiction, is it REALLY a disease?","I'd like to hear everyone's opinions in regards to this question. But first, I'll give my own.(note that this is only my opinion and by no means is meant to undermine anyone else's, it's simply meant to start a conversation). 
The DSM-5, which I believe is the most up to date diagnostic representation of psychological disorders states that addiction is indeed a disease(I may be wrong here, this was just what we used when I was in college). I haven't poured through the data myself, but nonetheless, it's in there. Here's my problem, stating that addiction is a disease gives us another reason to justify our using of our DOC. It's true that those with an addiction DO have mental and physical processes that exacerbate the using of drugs (anxiety, depression, pain, fear), to name a few. Also, there are brain scans that show that addicts do have different patterns than those of non-users. Yet, as far as I know, and based off of all the research I've done, there aren't any studies that show that those particular patterns exist PRIOR to the addiction taking place.  Of course, anxiety and depression can be the reason someone might turn to drugs, but isn't that the disease? Yes, we know that there are certain genes that can be inherited that make one more likely to become an alcoholic for example, this has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. BUT, these recessive genes aren't expressed unless they are turned on. Can't the argument be made that these expressions are simply a result of environment? For example, if a person had the alcoholic gene, if that person lived in a place where alcohol was never available, they wouldn't ever become an alcoholic. As an ex-addict(opiates), it always bugged me when the therapist would say ""firstly, let me tell you that what you have is a disease"". It seems like a cop out, like a way to tell yourself and others that what happened to you wasn't your fault. I never wished to become and addict, growing up I never even considered becoming an addict was a possibility, yet, like so many others, it happened. But it's not like one day I just woke up and needed to go get some heroin, it was a long process. Maybe it's more that some of us just have that little switch in our brain that makes it more difficult to quit things, an addictive personality as some might call it. But having an addictive personality doesn't directly result in addiction, again, i feel it's a result of the environment we live in. A disease can be something we're born with, a disease can be something that one day we wake up with. Indeed, environmental factors CAN cause diseases(one can be more hereditarily prone to skin cancer for example, yet if they don't go in the sun too often it won't ever happen).  Although I'm ashamed of it, I believe that my addiction was entirely my fault. I wasn't in a bad place at the time, in fact, I was at one of the highest points of my life. I had just finished college, I had a great job and was making tons of money. Having all that money allowed me to get all the drugs I wanted, and mainly, I just enjoyed the feeling of getting fucked up. I loved LSD (any entheogens actually), ketamine, every pill I could get my hands on, alcohol, weed, actually I can't really think of a drug I didn't like and I've nearly tried them all( I know there are a shit ton of new RC's that I haven't tried, so many I don't think anyone's tried them all), but you catch my drift. I just think us addicts need to take responsibility for our actions in every single form we can, without putting the blame on anything else. Whether addiction is a disease or not, and it very well may be, it's our job to see why we do what we do. Telling ourselves that we have a disease simply makes it easier to tell ourselves ""I can't quit"", ""I have a disease, and it's the disease that's eating at me"", ""it's not all my fault, my grandpa was an alcoholic too"".  We already have enough excuses and justifications, ""I'm hurt and this helps"", ""I just do it for fun"", ""I'm not worth shit anyway, so why quit""?.  What do you guys/gals think? Is there any reason that we should continue to tell ourselves we have a disease, or is this just another justification? Please keep it nice everybody, I know this can be a touchy issue and I'd really love to hear everyone's opinion. If you believe it is a disease, can you elaborate a bit as to why? If not, what do you believe brought you to the point of addiction? 
Thanks for reading, and I value all opinions.

So, my question is..What is the smallest amount of your DOC that you've ever copped, and how awful did you feel after??? \(not physically, because hopefully it was enough to get you well!\) Why did you have to get such a little amount, what happened??

There have been a few times \(sadly\) where I've only been able to scrape together 10 bucks and get 3 bags. Bundles are $25\(best prices out here\) so its embarrassing coming through with 15 asking for 5 bags, let alone 10 bucks for 3... most dudes don't even wanna serve you that little, but some will.

Idea to help those either using, stopping, PAWS, etc. Most Opiates hit the mu receptors in your brain, causing down-regulation of the density or amount of active receptor sites for these, which is responsible for withdrawal and PAWs (as most of you already know)... Well; Heat Exposure Therapy, I.E. Sauna Use (15-25 Min. Preferably) Or Hot Yoga (Even Better Cuz Exercise Too) Stimulates The Kappa Receptors In Your 'Knoggin. These are essentially your brains counter balance system to the mu side, which is why heat/kappa stimulation causes unpleasent feelings.

Now- The stimulation of kappa receptors promotes the regeneration/sensitization of the mu side, which is very helpful for tolerance, PAWS, recovery, all of the above. Just thought it'd be helpful for yall strugglin, PEACE!",1526941019.0

While I've been a poly user of several drugs throughout life, the most hellish of all being benzos and withdrawing off of them, I've never used prescription opiates or h. Only sold them.

I'd typically throw myself into a pot and Benzo haze every morning before my white collar programmer job, then at night my nights would be filled with more bud, some sort of Benzo, and flipping all sorts of drugs I could get my hands on to make a profit off of.

Out of all the substances and drugs I used to sell, the one I regret by far the most is opiates. Never have I had so many people begging me for some sort of relief, and if they were female and didn't have money, roughly 9 out of 10 times I'd be offered sex, head, anal, whatever for a couple Roxy 30s. As a nerdy younger male, this worked great for me in my 20s, but now as I age I regret ever accepting any of the sexual favors that were given to me over time. Now i have dealt with Benzo  (Xanax) addiction personally, so I do know what it's like to withdraw and feel terrible, but I'm assuming the degree of opiate withdrawal is sadly that much higher than other drugs.

My main reason for posting was to see if any of you were former dboys or dealers that took advantage of the opiate epidemic similar to the way I did? Selling ya buddy some green and a couple of hydro 10s is one thing, but people trading me cars for entire scripts of dilaudid is very much another in which I now regret the way I acted over the years.

Three months ago my GP changed practices, so Dr Suse hired two new fresh out of university student doctors so they could do their on sore training. I think mine learned a very valuable lesson. So on my first visit with her, I told her I'd like fortnightly fills becuse no matter what I do, I can just never make a whole month.. She was cool with it, handed me the magic papers, writing on them as she did... 80mg Cr night time, 40mg Cr + 20mg Cr breakfast.... You can imagine how she reacted to my request for so many pills, oh and I'd better get my 60 20mg oxynorm today to... ""Come back in 14 days and I will dispense another 28 of each of the SANDOZ generic....

This went on a few times, I don't know HOW she didn't realise, I mean she literally wrote out how many pills to take and gave me double that... 

WELL.... to begin with it was fat tastic! I even jammed a 5*80 shot in a 3ml and holy shit did it fuck me....

Anyway now for the downfall.... I had to take my disabled daughter to see a GP at same clinic, Nd I needed some rizatraptan for migraines. Anyway as soon as she saw the amount of oxy I was getting, strait to the head boss/owner....

When I went in for this fortnights app, I know I was gunna get it, first was I selling it? Nah.... OK I'm obviously using too many, why? Because my spine is fusing and I'm fucking sore, shit....

Have a got a problem with the pills? Well it's more a problem with the pain and trying to walk the line of pain relief and 'who gives a fuck about pain' - definitely not easy when you are getting 3 * 28ct boxes every 14 days...

In the end I'm assuming head Dr, Dr Suse kept me on because I've been there for ages, knows my daughter and how much I do for her... I assume he had final say overall.. 

So I got cut from SANDOZ crushable to targin instead 60mg twice daily, and 2*20mg norms per night.. I have to have weekly compliance checks and fills from same pharmacy till she trusts me again... 

I feel terrible that I abused our relationship for so long, she was almost crying last appointment, and lost it when she realised I should have another 3 months worth of oxy-nope I took it....

Have her again on we'd, gunna thank her for pulling my head in n giving me a chance to still get pain killers... Rather than cutting me adrift like so many other Drs would have...

8l3rcp,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8l3rcp/has_anyone_tried_this_purification_tek_for/,5,https://redd.it/8l3rcp,ifailedhschem,"Has anyone tried this purification TEK for, supposedly, ALL types of dope? Or have the chemistry knowledge to say whether or not it should work, even on tar?","I find it odd that after looking often for a purification TEK, suddenly finding one that supposedly works on tar and powdered dope is easy as 1 Google Search. 

It's credited back to like 2002, and Erowid.org has notes about how if you've got fentanyl-mixed heroin, you shouldn't do this (as that cut is gone and you'll OD). 

Looks like supplies needed are:

1. Glassware
2. HcL 28% (ish?)
3. Pipettes or Eye Droppers
4. Household Ammonia
5. Ethyl Ether
6. Baking Soda


Here is the TEK, cut and pasted from Erowid:

This is as complete and as accurate as I can remember, it has been something like 9 years since I have used heroin. The process I used for purification was straight forward. Diacetylmorphine can exist in two forms, an insoluble base, or a soluble salt. Often it contained a plethera of other agents like pieces of broken glass, pieces of foil, dirt, wood, metal, mannitol, lactose, maltose, sand, you get the idea. The first stage of the process I used was to make sure the diacetylmorphine I received was totally converted to a soluble hydrochloride salt. The heroin I usually received was a brown powdered heroin, sometimes off white, very little vinegar smell. Today all you can find is a black crud that reeks with a vinegar (acetic) odor. The way I made sure it was a soluble salt was to drop enough 28% hydrochloric acid to make it wet. This insured that I would not waste any of the available drug, but would remove most if not all of the cut. I think that it would be better for me to detail it in a procedural manner. FYI, hydrochloric acid can be purchased in gallon jugs at hardware stores under the name Muriatic acid, 28%.

First weigh out one gram of heroin from the stock you received from your supplier. Place this gram into a 13 x 100mm test tube. Add a few drops of 28% hydrochloric acid until it is evenly damp. Allow to react for a minute or two. Next add 5 ml distilled water, place your thumb over the end and carefully shake to dissolve all that will dissolve into the water. Allow the insolubles to settle. Using a pipette, remove and transfer as much of the liquid to a fresh test tube leaving the solids behind. Dispose of the undissolved remains in the first test tube. Slowly add via pipette, one drop at at time, ammonium hydroxide (water clear household ammonia) until the white precipitate ceases production. Add several more drops at this point just to be sure. Shake gently to be sure that all the solution is evenly ammoniated. The solution should look milky. Now add 100 ml ethyl ether (some kinds of diesel starting fluids, read the label) to a 150 ml beaker. Dump the milky liquid into the ether and stir briskly and allow the water to settle and collect on the bottom. The water will turn clear. Using a glass pipette, remove this water from the bottom of the beaker and dispose of. 

Now mix up a solution of 5ml 28% hydrochloric acid and 5ml distilled water and add this to the ether in the beaker. Stir briskly keeping as much acid/water suspended as possible for several minutes. Allow the water/acid to collect on the bottom of the beaker. Using a glass pipette, remove this water layer from the bottom of the ether and transfer to a glass petri dish. Transfer the ether back to its storage bottle for reuse. It will still contain small amounts of heroin base, so don't throw it out. Recycle! Slowly add small portions of sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) to the water/acid solution in the petri until you don't notice any more bubbles being formed. Place the glass on a warm surface, and allow to evaporate. The residue will be diacetylmorphine hydrochloride and salt. Table salt is a by-product of the reaction and will not hurt you at all when injected. Scrape up the residue and weigh it. Yield from one gram of smack (yea, we called it that) would be anything from 100 to 300 mg, rarely more. Place 100 mg of this powder in a test tube, add 10 cc sterile isotonic water for injection (available OTC at drug stores) and heat to boiling. Transfer this liquid while still hot using a syringe (available OTC at some drug stores) to a 10 ml rubber stoppered empty sterile ampoule (available OTC at drug stores).

To use this drug which is 10 mg/ml, extract with a sterile syringe as much drug as you wish to use. 10 mg would send me flying believe it or not. 2.5 mg (1/4 cc) was usually enough to keep me ""happy"" and was my normal dose. 20 mg was the most I could take safely in my opinion, and was a waste of drug and money. Normally, for most 150-170 lb males, 2.5 mg is more than enough in my opinion. Using heroin in this manner avoids the problems associated with ""street use"" and will keep your body healthy and safe, reducing the risk of disease and overdosage.

My memory is pretty good, and I think I covered all the bases here, but I may have made a mistake somewhere. Overall I think this is an accurate method, to the best of my ability to remember.


Obviously ether is a watched chemical, and I have my doubts that it just works so well in what, 4 steps or so with some filtering via pipettes, but I don't know much about chemistry. 

Anybody here able to vouch for this, or use their chem know-how to confirm/deny that it should work? Does it clean up poorly synth'd stuff, and always leave you with #4 and salt? 

So many questions, and I have none of the answers. Thanks to anybody who takes the time to read this and contribute answers or info, it's tempting if it's legit.

Long story short I had a baby and ever since then I've been getting this excruciating pains in my stomach. I've gotten tramadol twice in the past month. My doctor won't prescribe any more because I haven't actually been diagnosed so I think she don't believe me (she's not even a Dr she's a nurse but some how my PCP) 

So today I'm going to see a gyn. Because of course they're leaning towards it being in my ovaries or something. I don't want to get to gory.

I've got Meloxicam, it made me super sick. It did take away the pain but made me dizzy and very very fatigue. I have a two year old, I can't afford to be fatigue.

Then she gave me flexiril and naproxen.
The flexiril didn't help at all. It just made me livid pissed off when I took it, even when I woke up at night to my daughter I was just highly aggitated.

A couple of days ago, I rolled on MDMA, done it about 10 times this year, though almost all of them the last 2 months however \(about every week\). Been smoking heroin daily for a month tomorrow. During that roll I did some speed and weed and that was it. After the roll, I smoked a lot of weed and heroin and when holding my breath for about 10 seconds, then going from a sitting position to standing, I'd get a weird, fucked up ""seizure"".

I got lightheaded, a head rush, then my entire body would fucking freeze/paralyze and twitch, and at that point I'd be in a delirium/catatonic\-like state, everything was blurry and couldn't focus on anything. Couldn't freely think or move. Then I'd slowly come back to my senses, with thought organizing again and me regaining control of my body. It literally felt like my brain and reality was glitching/crashing.

Afterwards, I'd feel my entire body pulsating for a couple of seconds, I'd get weird euphoric feelings and it felt like my brain did a ""restart"". It lasted only a few seconds every time, and it probably happened about 20 times or more, although it has yet to happen again since that night.

I started repeating the behavior, getting the ""seizure"" each time, because it had powerful dissociative, euphoric and ""rush"" effects, however I'm now realizing how that may be dangerous. Why did I get those ""seizures"" and could it have hurt me in any way?

Be smart and patient and come up with a plan to hit a piece of shit where it hurts.  

Yesterday morning, my homeboy got taken for $300 because his middle women just took off and turned her phone off.  The dumb bitch did this even though my boy knows where she lives, what she drives, etc.  

So last night, he went to her complex and put a mixture of chemicals (he owns a auto mechanic shop) in her gas tank so when she wakes up and goes to start her Mazda 3, well lets just say, the repairs will out cost $300!

Also, if you ever to decide to slash someones tires, only do 3    If all 4 get slashed the insurance can cover it.  Learned that tidbit from him lol.

So in friday I hitted a vein after 3 tries which I missed. The IM shot was good too but then at my 4th try I recognized a vein and shot. It was the best and intense rush I ever had. Wow.

There are so many anecdotal and theoretical answers on this, it's insane.

Question 1 - **does calcium carbonate or dextromethorphan (dxm) potentiate codeine?**

Question 2 - **does magnesium, calcium carbonate or anything similar potentiate OR reduce tolerance to dexamphetamine?**

Please only answer if you **know** through extensive experience the answer to these questions. **I know different people react differently, but there must be an objective, pharmacological answer to these questions.**

I feel like so many people want answers to these questions but they are literally impossible to find without every second person throwing in their two cents on why you shouldn't mix such items, why the fella with the comment above is a fool, or why you should venture to another thread.

Everyone talks about the inhibition of P450 (codeine) or CYP2D6 (amphetamines and opiates) but conclusive answers are tough as nails to find. 

**We're not here to put Socks on Centipedes everyone, let's resolve this once and for all** 

Sorry for the blunt and demanding nature of this post but I'm getting frustrated haha. 

Love you all 

**TLDR: comment if you KNOW of potentiators  for codeine or dexamphetamine**

I snorted 10mg with my friend. After a while my friend started feeling it, yet I felt nothing. I thought it might just take some time so I just waited. An hour in and my friend started nodding and I didn't feel shit. 
So a few weeks later I tried again, but with double the dose. I again didn't feel a thing. 

Do you guys think I might just be resistant to oxy (if that even is possible) or do I just have to take a bigger of a dose?
I'm also resistant to tramadol somehow; I took 400mg and didn't feel anything, is that linked to the oxy resistanse?

Fyi I am not dependant on any opiate.
I‚Äôm going to write my questions and then More detail will be given about myself and the situation (IMPORTANT so please read it, will be the last paragraph).

‚Ä¢does tramadol cause any euphoric effects at 50mg? 

‚Ä¢What doses would you say are good for someone who‚Äôs new to opiates as a whole

‚Ä¢how many days should I leave between each dose to avoid addiction?

‚Ä¢is tramadol a good choice with given situation? 

I am a 19 year old Male. Suffer from pretty bad anxiety issues and that creates paranoia, also have pretty bad depression, some days I sit and break down, some i don‚Äôt. 50/50 chance every day, that‚Äôs why I want to know how many days I should leave between each use.

I first took cocodamol 30/500 codeine/paracetamol (for anyone who doesn‚Äôt know) and they make me feel pretty good. Although it wasn‚Äôt recreational. It was for a tooth infection. Once the pain stopped I stopped using cocodamol because I was scared of becoming dependant on it. (Ikr over 60mg of codeine for about 4 days, once a day) this was around 5 days ago since I stopped. 

So for those who didn‚Äôt read what‚Äôs above I‚Äôm 19, Male, have pretty bad anxiety and depression that I struggle to deal with. It‚Äôs a day to day thing and I am on NO other medication. I do smoke weed quite often to help bring my anxiety down but doesn‚Äôt always work. And that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm looking into opiates. I‚Äôm becoming sick of the condition I‚Äôm in and I would kill just to feel normal again. And I‚Äôve heard tramadol acts as an SRNI also. So this got me curious and I read about people feeling euphoria. Only one person said he‚Äôs on 200mg daily and he feels great and functional. I don‚Äôt wanna be in such a high dose but I just want the edge taken away. The feeling that something is gonna go wrong wherever I go. Feelings of people staring at me and overthinking what people think about me. Overthinking every single action I make and looking back on it after to point out the flaws. 

Tramadol Is my only hope right now. I don‚Äôt wanna delve too far into the world of opiates because I have a very addictive personality and I have lost family to opiates. I don‚Äôt want to become dependant just something as a last resort when I‚Äôm feeling this SHIT.

It's a long post below, I just don't really have anyone to talk to about this part of my life. 

I've been wanting to get clean for a while, I moved out to California to escape my hometown back east and attempt to get clean. Being the junkie I am though, I sought out this devilish drug, which took me no time at all to find a relatively steady connect. Its been around 9 months now since I started using out here, and I'm just absolutely miserable.

I was working some shitty job, only 20 or so hours a week, for shitty pay. I took the job originally just to get out of the fucking house, and attempt to make some friends out here, but I just very recently fucked that up. Misses two shifts because I was sick as fuck, and just didn't return or make a phone call to them mostly out of embarrassment.

Fortunately, I came from a rather wealthy family, which is both a blessing and a curse. My father pays my rent out here, luckily he just got me my own studio apartment because he thinks I'm doing better than I have been in the last 5 years of my life. Because of my addiction we've never been to close with one another. His sister died early from addiction, and alcoholism played a part in my grandfathers death as well, so has a hard time dealing with all this. Since I've moved out west, we've actually been able to form a pretty strong relationship and I talk to him daily multiple times. The fact that it's more or less built on a lie of how well I'm doing here, is beginning to eat away at me. Causing me to get waves or extreme depression lately that'll just come and go.

I got high on heroin for the first time 9 years ago at the sweet age of 16. I can honestly say up until just a few months ago I never gave a fuck about what my actions were doing to my friends and family. I didn't give a shit about frivolously spending my fathers hard earned money well because, he's rich what the fuck does it matter, I was only concerned with having a good time or getting high.Now though, it truly eats away at me, that I can be such a fucking heartless piece of shit human being. I desperately want to get clean now, because lying and using my father like this now is absolutely taking a toll on me. I just sit in my apartment everyday by myself getting high, hating life.

Today though, I was lucky. My connect gave me three suboxone‚Äôs, two bars of Xanax, and around forty 600mg gabapentin for free, because she can see the pain in my eyes (her words), and knows what its like kicking dope. I actually deleted any number that I could use to get anything, and did a shot and threw my whole set up into the trash. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever wanted to get clean so bad in my life before. I actually cannot stand the person I am today and it quite literally makes me sick to my stomach. 

Truthfully, I wish that I had the balls to just end my life today; just put a ton of extra dope into one shot, hit a vein and fade into nothingness. Never have to deal with disappointing the ones I love the most again, and not having to ever fall back down this miserable rabbit hole. As much as I want to though I just know I don‚Äôt have it in me to do so. Which realistically is a good thing, but I really cannot picture myself having a productive fulfilling future. One where I enjoy where I‚Äôm at, what I‚Äôm doing with my life, and one where heroin isn‚Äôt involved.

Tomorrow at this time exactly, I will take my first 8mg sub with half a bar and a ton of gabapentin. I don‚Äôt just actually want it this time, and desperately need to get clean. I see the homeless out here in California, and cannot help but think how that‚Äôs going to be me, if I make it another couple of years in this hellish life. 

Sorry for the long post. Sorry for jumping around a lot in my writing as well there‚Äôs just a lot on my mind currently. Thanks for reading for all those who did. This is why I enjoy our community here at r/opiates. You all understand the struggle, the pain, the highs and lows that come with such a lifestyle. Enjoy the rest of your day everyone, cheers mates.


Edit: Not that anyone will probably see this. But I made this post on Sunday, and took my last shot at around 530pm. Today is Tuesday at 8:42pm, and I haven't gotten high. These two days are the longest I have clean, off of just dope, in the last couple of months. Ate some gabapentin yesterday when I awoke, and held me until around 7pm. Haha I then took 2 bars of xanax, blacked out. Who knows if I slept. I awoke, earlier today to find I ordered uber eats 3 times, the last was at 7am. And on my night stand was an open suboxone, so I'm guessing I took one at some point throughout the night. But no heroin, and I'm very happy.",1526856150.0

My girlfriend found out I was doing them again (after a big fight and withdrawal the first time) and now my relationship might be over.  She is understandably pissed, I‚Äôm constantly out of money and just sucking at life.  I hate myself and this shitty fucking habit.

I was trying to ween off too, which makes this more frustrating.  If I had stuck to my plan and not fucked it up this wouldn‚Äôt have happened.

Anyways, now it‚Äôs all out in the open and I‚Äôve even told my mother who is very understanding and just wants to help.

I was on over 120 mgs a day of oxy, now I‚Äôm trying to do 30 a day.  SUCKS.  

My girlfriend has my pills and is strictly giving me 30 a day.  My worry is that all I have left are these green 187 pills, which look fully legit but I don‚Äôt feel anything.  So my runway is fucked.  Anyone have any experience with the green 187‚Äôs ?

I also bought Kratom, a brand called Kratom Kaps from a headshop.  I took 4 a few days ago and kinda scared me.  I know everyone says to order online and that headshop stuff sucks, but I‚Äôm not spending money on that.  Are these Kratom Kaps legit ?  Or do they have like bath salts in them.

I‚Äôm just trying to make it OFF.  I‚Äôm fully committed to doing therapy and meetings and everything.  I‚Äôve been hating this habit for months.  I‚Äôm just worried about the next few days as I have to go to work and my boss is flying in from New York for meetings Wednesday .

This is far from my first time chewing the patches, and i have a pretty decent tolerance. However, I usually cut them and chew it up in smaller pieces. Today is the first time I put the whole thing in my mouth. I‚Äôve been chewing it, off and on, for a couple of hours now and I feel pretty damn good.

Now let's go back to yesterday. I live in a bad place in the city and run trough the ""open market"" almost everyday to go to work, see some friends etc so i'm going trough my normal path when a nigga carrying a fucking gun (don't know a lot about guns but i THINK it was an ak-47, they are kinda famous around these areas) is running at my direction. I froze thinking ""this is it, there's some shooting going on and that's where i die"" but no he came running, handed me a package (while running and without saying shit) and just kept running, after 10s maybe a police car goes by full speed probably chasing that guy.


I stood there for 5min maybe thinking the guy or someone else would come back for the package but no one did so i go home. When i get home and open the package, it's like a brick on heroin. Don't know the name or number or anything like that but i've seen by photos and it was defnitely H. When i used i only got Tar so i could smoke but this shit was gray so maybe it was a better and more expensive type, don't know.


Afraid of getting smoked for stealing a whole package of dope (don't know how much it weight it either, i don't have a scale but i guess it was something around 20g or maybe 30g, i have no clue) i go to the open market at night and start talking to an old fellow i've bought before, i explained the shit to him and he got the package from me and told me to wait. He came back less than a minute then thanking me for this and saying the boss told him to get me 3g of the best dope they had. My mind is racing and the devil in my shoulders is screaming GET THAT SHIT YOU FUCKING BITCH GET THAT BITCH THIS RIGHT HERE IS THE BEST DEAL OF YOUR LIFE but i told the guy: ""No thanks, i'm clean of that shit"" and started walking, i hear the guy saying behind me ""fine man, do what you want"".

Today after going to the supermarket, some random guy came to me saying he heard of the package i gave them back and offered me some beer since he heard i wasn't using it anymore. I told thanks but i wasn't drinking either, my goal was to be 100% sober for as long as i could before i start drinking again (never had a problem with alcohol just doesn't want to change one addiction with another) so the guy gives me a lazy smile like ""nigga i give you 1 week to start getting high again"" but then he gave me 50 reais ( something around 15 dollars) and went back to his thing.

I have no idea what happened to the guy that was running, he probably didn't want to get caught with drugs and handed me the shit without thinking twice. Moral os the story is: 1 week clean and 15 dollars richer yaayyy

He's done it in the past and I haven't done anything about it, but inspired by a post a little while ago on this subject I vowed that if he did it again I would make a move.

The reason I haven't made the call already is I think they have been friends for a while and I'm worried that if it doesn't go to plan I'll be cut off from my current guy.

It would be highly financially beneficial for me to make this connection.. my hookup has the best, most consistent gear around but it's also the most expensive. I know I would be saving at least $50 a bag I can pull this off and also potentially be able to start a lucrative middling racket.

My appetite is back, my sex drive is back, everything feels completely normal throughout the day even as far as my body temperature regulation...then 10pm rolls around and I spend all night on fire. None of the temperature switch part going from freezing/hot. Just fucking burning up. I can't sleep because of it and I'm not sure if anybody else has experienced this with fent -even when every other w/d symptom is gone.

FML,"Because I'm a 28 year old loser, I live with my dad and his girlfriend. My dad is also borderline alcoholic. That's not a problem though because it's legal.
   Anyway, I spent 2 hours of driving to get the best quality and quantity I knew I could get. Because it's so time consuming, it's not a connect ya I use often.
   So I get home, and finally get one in. Finally, I can relax. Nope! My dad, repeatedly walks in my room saying shit like; 
 
""are you sure you're me okay?""
""Why your eyes look funny?""

   I got tired of him walking in and out of my room, so I told him the truth. I shot up. Immediately, he opens my top dresser drawer, grabs my rig and squirts out my dark piece of heaven. He grabs all the paraphernalia, takes it to the burn pile, 10 ft from his beer.
   I'm entirely outraged, but understand. What pisses me off, he doesn't listen to anything I say. My girl comes home from jail this week and I'm staying sober from thereon out. The whole point of partying today, was for one last dance with the devil before I say goodbye for a long, long time.             My dad keeps threatening to call the police to send me to prison while at the same time trying to give me hugs and tells me he loves me. All I can think about is the waste of time, money and product.
    Just so we're on the same page, I know he has a point. At the same time, I cannot help but to be completely outraged which is why I'm venting here. ",1526802078.0

8kqp0q,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8kqp0q/need_some_advice/,31,https://redd.it/8kqp0q,pissdrunx801,Need some advice.,"In the last few days, I‚Äôve gotten into some hot water with my connect. It all stems from a gram he fronted me, where I basically didn‚Äôt pay him on time \(the Too Long; Can‚Äôt Read version\). Let me start off by saying, these are the ideal dope dealers. We‚Äôll call them Adam and his tough\-no\-bullshit\-sometimes\-a\-bitch girlfriend, Rachel. They usually always have good product \(BTH\), insanely good prices. First dealer in 11 years to give fronts. No bullshit \(that is, until yesterday\). They are reliable and, for the most part, very punctual. They are good at communicating quality of product, actual ETAs, hold\-ups and traffic or anything that might make them late. They deliver to my neighborhood in the boonies \(for a small fee\). As I mentioned, Rachel wears the pants in their little dope operation and can be a real bitch sometimes to keep things running smoothly. But other than that, I‚Äôve had no complaints.

As stated above, they gave me a front on a gram. I told them I‚Äôd have the money tomorrow. Anyway, tomorrow rolls around. I leave work and don‚Äôt have time to cash my check. The girl who owes me money won‚Äôt be able to meet until later. I tell them I won‚Äôt be able to get the money together tonight, if I could just pay them tomorrow. I also told them that I MIGHT have $50 \(out of the $60 I owed\) if/when my homie comes through. Rachel says that tomorrow is fine. About an hour later, she says that they are doing business in the area and might try and come through for the money after my homie does. To make a long story shorter, homie can‚Äôt come through tonight with my money. I tell Rachel this, and she BLOWS UP my phone, basically accusing me of lying and giving them the run around in order to buy me some more time to get the money together. I tell her I will have her money in the morning \(which, remember, she had already agreed to before this anyway\).

I hit them up in the morning \(yesterday\) and we agree to meet so I can pay them and to also buy another gram. I tell them that I will find a ride \(about a half hour drive\) so they didn‚Äôt have to drive to me \(as they both have warrants\). I get to the meeting spot and she says that Adam is locked in the bathroom, ‚Äúlooking for a vein‚Äù trying to shoot up, that they will head over in a few. Probably 30 minutes roll by. Ok‚Ä¶ She tells me to be patient, that they will be there. Another 30 minutes. What the fuck? Can I come to their motel room? What's going on? Another 30 goes by. She gets bitchy with me and tells me to be patient. I tell her I‚Äôm about to take off. She says ‚ÄúOk, 15 minutes,‚Äù which come and go. Says she left her scale and had to go back. Another 15, then she says she left her phone and had to go back. At this point I know she is obviously lying to me. I leave to go score somewhere else.

A few hours later, the texts start coming in. She rips into me for not being patient \(I waited there for over two hours\). I tell her that it was obvious she was lying, which is ironic since she had reamed me out hard last night for supposedly lying to her and giving her the run around. I‚Äôm not just a fucking worthless junky whose time is less valuable than theirs. Fucking hypocrite‚Ä¶ And, frankly, disrespectful. She goes off on me, and now Adam is hitting me up from another phone: ‚ÄúDisrespecting my girl, I‚Äôll fuck you up bitch. Call me a liar, the last words you‚Äôll say to me mutherfucker.‚Äù Yada, Yada, Yada. Something to that extent.

Now I‚Äôm getting it from all sides, and she tells me she wasn‚Äôt lying but that Adam had actually been up all night, locked in a bathroom, tweaking and trying to find a vein. She asks if we can drop the whole thing, and I agree. I‚Äôm at a concert, but will hit them up after to see if we can meet so I can pay them, although I‚Äôm not particularly looking forward to a meet\-up with a dude threatening me and running on huge amounts of speed and heroin and no sleep. I then text Adam the same thing, that he isn‚Äôt thinking right, and will call him after the show when he has calmed down a bit. He says, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt even fucking call me.‚Äù

Holy christ, this got long‚Ä¶ So, r/opiates, what should I do with this predicament? What am I gonna do in that situation, not defend myself? It would be a bummer to lose this connect, but I‚Äôm honestly trying to stay clean, so maybe it wouldn‚Äôt be such a bad thing? Obviously, I‚Äôm trying to avoid any heated, potentially violent confrontation with these people. It sounded like Rachel was willing to drop the whole situation as long as I paid, that she didn‚Äôt want to lose me as a customer. And maybe Adam was just spun\-out, acting crazy, doing asshole meth stuff? What would you do in my situation?",1526793056.0
