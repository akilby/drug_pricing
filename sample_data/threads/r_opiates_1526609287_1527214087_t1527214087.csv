8ly5q1,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8ly5q1/i_really_hate_junkies/,0,https://redd.it/8ly5q1,Mathofakko,I really hate junkies.,"**No,  I'm  not talking about all drug or opiate addicts/""junkies"".  I'm basically a junkie myself, you could say I was a junkie long before I ever tried heroin. But I'm sick of all the bullshit associated with lots of drug users.**

Ever since I started with heroin, things have really went downhill. It's the most effective drug at treating my struggles of all that I've tried, and I never get fucked up, just take enough for my pains to go away. I've started to get withdrawals and it'¨s been hell all day. But I have a female junkie friend \(who's 20 years older than me and she's homeless, living in a homeless shelter\). She appears very trustworthy, but every time she's been helping me get H, I usually end up scammed/robbed. First time I got scammed, I got 0,6g when I bought 1,2g \(always weigh my shit\), she gave me half of what I bought. She told me that she got scammed too, and that it wasn't her fault in any way, we went with one of her friends.

Then I got a number from her to meet a friend of her to buy from, it turns out she was a crackhead, and she didn't even sell dope, she took my cash and never came back outside. \(If only I had seen where she went inside..\) My junkie\-friend told me it was my fault. \(Yes, sorry that I actually trust people, learned from those mistakes by now.\)

I tried buying it off the street an early morning after a roll, because I didn't have any H left. Met an amph\-guy who claimed to be selling heroin as well when I asked him. Guess what? I got speed, a weird brown powder and not H. Barely any speed at that weight, but at least I got some fucking drugs that time at least. I ended up smoking all the speed mixed with a brownish powder \(Which wouldn't even melt. I put it on foil, I even literally put it inside a flame and it simply turned black, no smoke. Didn't work shit, although I continued to smoke the whole thing desperately, of course, with the result of having the worst speed I've ever consumed in my system.

Today I met up with my junkie\-friend, we were both dopesick and was going to get some dope together, although of course she brings in other people she knows, and I have to wait for hours. Finally I meet her again, and she's with a girl, and they tell me that her friend's boyfriend ran off with all the money. This time I just KNEW something like this would happen. I was asking if she could join me and sell half a gram of speed to get enough for dope, however she talked about letting her sell it for me and meeting up with her when she had the dope she was going to get with another friend.

She also demanded her old phone back, which I borrowed from her because my last one broke.

At this point we were waiting for her friend. I had enough and simply left her. I knew wouldn't get my dope or cash back anyways, so I went home instead of waiting with her like an idiot while being sick as fuck.

I stood there alone with nothing left except a little weed and half a gram of amphetamine. I've quitted speed, so I didn't want to take it at all. But when I got home, I just said fuck it and took a couple of lines, some weed and a drink to calm down, but I found two 30mg codeine pills too, so all this made me feel a little better temporarily.

Things got a little better however, as I was lucky enough to get a new phone from insurance because the last one broke. I borrowed some cash from a good \(real\) friend, and called a dealer \(which I bought from once, he had the greatest shit I've tried so far, much better than what I've bought from my junkie  ""friend"". I have a huge suspicion that she's been cutting the heroin to make a profit, heroin that's already cutted to hell. Some days ago, I actually tasted speed from some part of the dope I was smoking, and it's funny how I traded speed4dope with her some days before that..\), not expecting him to answer as I've attempted to call him numerous times since I met him the first time. He was my only choice other than the junkie or buying off the streets.

He answered though, he asked who I was and I told him we met before. He was available and he told me he had very, very good dope this time, though it would be more expensive because of that. To afford it, I offered to give him my cash and 0,4g of speed. He actually accepted my offer, and I met him along with two of his buds, and the deal was done in under 5 minutes. I asked if I could just call whenever I need to buy, and he said yes. I've just taken a little bit so far, and it feels much better than what I've tried before.

I've made the decision that I won't deal with \-that\- kind of junkies anymore. Not my ""friend"" either. If she has no blame in all this, and she also got robbed/scammed those times, I still have to leave. She's dragging me into so much bullshit, she won't even give me any numbers to dealers. She wants me to get my dope through her.

I'm done with her anyways. And I'm fucking done losing all my cash and getting sick. From now on I'll have to do this solo. And a drug deal is supposed to last less than 5 minutes, not fucking 5\+ hours of waiting

\(Sorry for long post, just needed to get my feelings out.\)

**tl;dr: got scammed/robbed numerous times to the point of being broke because of a junkie I know, been pretty sick, got in contact with a good dealer later, sold the last of my speed and got my fix in the end.**",1527213574.0

I’m 6 years clean as of two weeks ago. Typical story, started with vics, turned into percs, turned into roxies, turned into H, etc. I pretty much destroyed my entire life and killed myself in the process, or whoever that person was before drugs. But I cleaned up my act. I got my shit together for once and I rebuilt everything. I have a good stable job, trusting family, I’m newly married, my credit score is excellent, and I’m about to start looking at buying a house all by myself. But I can’t stop thinking about heroin. I’ve been clean for a long time and some days are easier than others. Most usually aren’t bad. I usually think about dope every day, but not even in a sense of wanting to do it....just thinking about it. But for the past two weeks all I want to do in the world is get some oxy or some h. Non-stop crowding my mind and it’s making me depressed. I don’t want to struggle anymore. I didn’t think I would have to struggle for so long. I wish I never touched the shit. I have such a good life now, why am I even thinking about throwing it away? Truth be told I know I’m not going to. I moved away from my dope city a long time ago, so I have no connect and I’m not a cold cop type of guy. But if it came into my lap I know I would say yes. Fortunately I’ve distanced myself far enough from that life. I don’t really know why I’m posting this, I just needed to get this off my chest. Thanks for letting me ramble. For those of you out there still scoring, stay safe and enjoy! And for those of you that are clean and struggling to stay that way, just know you’re not alone!",1527212068.0

Recently though, i lost my job. And with it my health insurance. My sub dr is in another state and im on 16mg a day. So shit got spendy fast incredibly fast.

Ive had to resort to wheelin and dealin with other sub patients to make ends meet and not be sick.

This week i was 2 days short to my refill. I didnt wanna spend both days sick. Im waiting to start a new job i really need and the second all my stuff comes back theyll likely tell me to come to work now in the same phone call. So im trying to be somewhat well in case that happens too.

I could not find shit this time around as far as bupe goes. My only options were dope, methadone, or go sick. Fuck going back to dope. I really didnt wanna be sick. So......

I broke down and bought 2 10mg methadones. I dont have much experience with the done at all. I live in rural midwest so there hasnt been a clinic near me that does anything but subs. So ive never really had the choice. Ive been okay with that till these last 2 days.

Even just 10mg done a day had me feeling better than the subs. I wasnt so bogged down by a high dose. Having energy was nice. I didnt get sick for a considerable amount of time which was surprising. And most of all i didnt have any cravings. Thats something ive never been able to achieve with subs. I was talking to the dude i got them from and i guess theres a clinic doing done 20 miles from me. Which aint too bad to drive.

I know its a full agonist and all that pharmacology. So i dont need that all explained to me. I just want some personal testimony i guess. Anyone spend a long time as an addict (10+ years) do better on methadone than subs?

Now that i have the option mear me, Im leaning towards switching both for price and efficacy",1527205021.0

Or is it just me?,"I fell in love with opiates since extracting opium from poppies I grew a while back, I joined this sub thinking it may be a place to share knowledge and experiences. But I came and it seems everyone is hooked. 

Personally I found opium and other opiates to help me learn how to feel uninhibited pleasure outside of taking anything. I learnt a lot from opiates. And when I see people struggle it hurts.

I asked myself how people could get so hopelessly addicted to these things and why I had not fallen into it after using on and off for a while and only really experiencing positives. Outside of withdrawal.. which I don’t allow my use to ever get to..

Then i realized most addicts don’t take psychedelic drugs.

I used mushrooms on occasion as a reset. Whenever I fall into any addictive behaviour I take a large dose of mushrooms and get healed. Sounds silly. But going into psychedelic experiences with true intent can be a life saver. I am addiction free. I take mushrooms a couple times a year. And I rarely use opiates. Now and then I take Kratom. Rarely ever two days in a row.

I’m not trying to sound conceited, but I just want to offer this piece of advice to others. If you are an addict. Take mushrooms. At least 4-5grams

It’s helped me with my addictive behavior and I’m sure it could help many of you. Opiates are incredible. But nothing compared to being free of cravings",1527196531.0

Edit: Uploaded a better (still fucking blurry) picture of the shit [here](https://imgur.com/a/SFsCNcs). That's about .5g. The more I look at it, the less I think it's gunpowder. Pretty sure it's just #4 that's been transformed into a weird fucking gooey ball of sub-par dope. 

Looks like dark rocks covered in a brown powder. Draws up a deep red-amber color and it almost looks orange in the rig. Quality fluctuates dramatically from pick up to pick up, but overall it's pretty garbage. The weirdest part is the cut leftover - all of the dope appears water soluble but every 'rock' leaves behind hard black specks and red sprinkles, like there's pill casing residue in it.

If it’s just fent and not heroin too, can I hope If my mom quick cups me, nothing will show? (I describe the stuff in post)","Last night my mom said she’s gonna start randomly drug testing me, (long story) I have a feeling she’ll come home from work today with a quick cup, and if I fail things are about to go real bad for me. I’m hoping that what I’ve been using might just be fent and not show up on whatever test she uses... **it’s pure white powder and is completely clear like water in the needle. It gets a little foggy when stirring it and some clear grains(?) fall to the bottom of the spoon that make crushing feeling/sound when I press down on them.**   


The high wears off quickly but has almost like a stimulant reaction on me, I get distracted reading things on my phone and type long texts, and I’m able to get tasks done that I normally can’t get myself out of bed to do. **It’s extremely easy to do too much, or too little, it’s really hard to find the amount in between, it’s a fine line between barely any rush at all and waking up confused some time later with the needle nearby.** I know how dangerous it is to guess amounts, and I plan to get back on suboxone soon because I can’t seem to stay clean without it.        



**So I’m hoping what I’ve been using is just fentanyl and whatever she tests me with won’t show it, does it sound like that’s a possibility? Or is it likely there’s heroin in this stuff too?**    



If it’s likely there’s more than just fent, I’ve even worried there could be some sort of stimulant in it from how I act throughout the day, but It’s obvious an opiate since I’ve ‘gone out’ on it a few times but luckily just woken up each time it happened. But for now im just trying to worry about whether there’s heroin in it or not, I’m used to it probably being a mix but this stuff is different, what is your guess?   



**So: what are the chances it’s just been fentanyl and I pee in the cup and pass without trying to beat it?? Or should I try to beat the test, but my options are limited, I have no one to find to get clean pee, and no time to order anything online. Can quick cups be beat by pouring something else in them like water or juice/soda??**   


*My anxiety is through the roof right now.*    



**edit**: I just realized I have a first check drug test I could be experimenting with but I’m so scared of finding out I’m screwed. Would I test it by just seeing if I piss dirty, or use it to see if pouring tap water in my pee would work, or anything of the sort. I even thought of getting my little brother’s pee from the toilet, since he usually doesn’t flush, but it would be very diluted, and he’d have to pee sometime soon, should I get his toilet pee if I have the chance?

Went where the junkies hang out, offered a dude a few bucks to take me to his guy. It's not too hard to tell who the dealers are, but I figure the dealers are going to be a little more comfortable selling if I'm with some locals than if some strange white boy walks up and asks to buy drugs.

Dude is stoked to make a few bucks and obviously is gonna hustle a couple bags as the middle man. Whatever, cost of doing business, as long as I save some time and I'm not wandering aimlessly around the block when the neighborhood is crawling with police.

Another dude chases us down and starts bitching about the fact that the first guy is taking me to a different dealer. Starts putting his hands on me and trying to pull me one way. A third guy sees the incident and starts pulling me another way, trying to sell me crack which I don't want.

I decide to keep following the dude I threw a few bucks. The black dude with the crack wanders off, the bearded Latino dude follows me and the junkie I asked to help me out in the first place and harasses him, telling the dude he owes him and acting all hurt he was taking me to buy off someone else.

At this point, the Latino dude has been keeping his hands on me. I got bad vibes from him but I trust the other junkie to at least take me to get decent dope even though he's gonna try and lie about prices so he can score a couple bags for himself on my dime.

Some other dude on the street walked up next to me, shook his head, and whispered ""walk with me"" and started trying to make like we knew each other. This confirmed my bad vibes about the Latino dude that was insistent on coming with us. He threatened to fuck the good Samaritan up, and we kept walking. I decided that in terms of strength, not to mention possible weapons, trying to ditch the dude with his hands on me would be more likely to result in personal injury and legal trouble than if i kept walking.

My faith in the junkie I asked to introduce me to his guy was well placed enough. I got what I needed, it was the strongest I've ever had, and the price would have been alright if he hadn't tried to give me half of what I paid for because I looked suburban. No big deal there, I got a number and a few corners I can try without arousing too much suspicion.

Sketchy Latino dude tells me the middle man gave him some stamps to pay him back for something, then he hands them to me and demands that I pay him for the stamps... which were originally purchased with my money. I tell him I have no cash left on me and tell him to go settle his dispute with the middle man himself. He gets bent out of shape, starts demanding $20, and then throws a brick at the guy from earlier who was trying to get me away. He insists we go to an atm and I figure I'd rather just pull $20 out of an ATM than deal with this crackhead in a neighborhood I don't know.

Needless to say, we hit the ATM, he reaches over and types in $200 on the ATM while I'm trying to pull out money, grabs my money and my card out of the machine, and tells me he's gonna hook me up with some bundles since the other guy skimmed a few bags off of me. We're I not holding at the time, I would have started swinging at the guy when he reached over and punched in a different number while I tried to take out money, but at this point I'm now holding and from out of town, so a brawl that doesn't end with a quick knockout is going to end with me going to jail when the locals back his story over mine.

Where it gets fucking bizarre, is that he spent the next two hours wandering around knocking on doors, making calls, and insisting he would get me more dope while holding onto my atm card. My dumb ass, reluctant to let my atm card walk, followed him around while he tried to pull out more money, not realizing the card was locked out for suspicious activity. He bought me dinner, kept promising his guy would meet us in ten minutes, and I got a couple other phone numbers and samples from dudes that told me this guy was a dickhead.

I figured that humoring the dude was the smartest call because he couldn't pull any more money out and if I hung around long enough I'd at least get the card back, and he had already exhibited violent tendencies anyway. As far as I was concerned, anything I could have done to set him off would draw attention from LEO and put me at risk.

In either case, I'm out $200 and I don't think the bank will reimburse it even though the withdrawals were under implied duress and he memorized the pin code and made the actual withdrawal.

I cannot for the life of me figure out why he would waste so much time acting like he was trying to get me a couple bundles, buy me a meal, and then hand my card back to me if he was just trying to rob me. There's a part of me that's quietly distraught that he might have actually been the world's shittiest dope dealer and that I might have gotten so fed up with the bullshit that I just left him with my money moments before the drugs arrived because his friend texted me that ""he's got your stuff"" shortly after I left.

Should I just block the number and hope I never see the dude again? Return with a couple friends and a tire iron? Feel the situation out? Report the card stolen?

And did I do the right thing by not causing a scene while I was holding? I feel like a pushover for letting him grab my money and for hanging around as if he would actually deliver... but the alternatives seemed excessively risky.

Anyway folks, hopefully my misfortune was of some amusement to you. I just finished off the last remnants of what I picked up that night so I wouldn't figure that the narrative is super clear. In either case, I hate being away from home, shit is so easy where I live. The different organizations have their different corners, no one yells to try and get your attention or steal your business from a competitor, buying drugs is a fucking simple, civilized, quiet process.",1527111595.0

been on and off this hamster wheel for a good decade now. nothing new in my story. wisdom teeth > hydros > medicine cabinets > oxycontin > heroin > iv heroin. rehabs a handful of times, i string together a year or two, and slowly fall back into the cycle. got out of rehab last year, stayed clean for another year, then push came to shove started dabbling again. i’ve been “chipping” but i’m far enough down this road i know that lifestyle is a mirage. 

currently on day 4 clean from a week bender - had a work trip to chicago and blindly searched for some areas to cold cop (love a good cold cop, especially in notoriously shitty areas with good tan) and rode that sack out through sunday morning. didn’t even plan on it - just that wandering boredom that turned into fueling some excitement when i landed. sometimes being a dope fiend feels like being a tourist just in a sick, twisted way. going to sw chicago felt like a normal tourist visiting the louvre 😂. i know some of you degenerates know this feeling. anyways, rambling.

reason i decided to post was because i realized i take a lot from here and give nothing. i’m one of those that comes here only when i’m withdrawaling or out. when i see the other posts about where people are at in their withdrawal or how frustrating this hamster wheel can get, it makes me feel better 🤷🏼‍♂️ - misery sure does love company. dori posted she was 48 hours in when i was ending my day one, and it gave me a benchmark - it gave me the realization that someone else is doing this too, which is why i decided to post. if this kind of thing helps anyone - leave a comment or PM. just talking or bullshitting feels to help me out when i’m in that acute phase or PAWS is setting in. someone posted about suicidal ideation from withdrawling and i’ve never gotten SI but the apathy and depression have been crippling in lately w/d’s.

In the movie it’s never elaborated on, and most people I’ve seen talking about it seem to think it’s a form of Dilaudid (hydromorphone), since that’s what they end up with a ton of in the movie. 

But I finally got around to reading the book, and I’m to the part after their first pharmacy robbery:
 

““How much do you want, babe?”

Diane hemmed and hawed and finally said, “Oh, I don’t know, give me a blue and a couple of sixteenths.”

Bob frowned. “You think you can handle all that?”

“You damn right.”

He handed her a ten milligram Numorphan tablet. It was blue and about the size and consistency of an aspirin… …Taken along with two sixteenths of Dilaudid in the form of two very small white pills, this dose would undoubtedly kill anyone but a confirmed addict. “

I have this massive natural tolerance so codeine never did much for me. Hydrocodone got me high, like a real opiate high, for the first time when I took like 50-70 mgs. After that, that was my DOC. I’d dose anywhere from 70-100 mgs with promethazine/diphenhydramine no problem. The supply of that ran out. It was never steady to begin with. Then my cousin who shot Dilaudid introduced it to me and I started snorting that. Did that for a couple months. I’d say about 6 months to a year or so. Dropped that habit for about 4 months then hopping right back in with 82.5 mgs of hydrocodone. That led me to picking up the dilaudid habit again. I shortly afterwards started IM the dilaudid to get a better bioavailability. I did that for 6 months or so then I was desperate one night and IVed 4 mgs and was surprised that it pinned my pupils. Payday came shortly afterwards and then I IVed the whole 8mg pill and that was it. The rush with the pins and needles felt amazing. Now I’m 6 months down the line with that and all I do is IV now. I couldn’t imagine doing it any other way and now I feel as if I can’t stop. I only get minor withdrawals after like 2-3 days without using which includes: nausea, slight chills, slight anxiety, and somewhat decent opiate cravings. Any advice or opinions on this? I’m 22 years old by the way.

Sorry for the rambling, just thought id thank you. now onto my question...

So ive been smoking for idk, like a month or two now. I dont smoke (tar) everyday usually about every 2 days sometimes ,multiple days off sometimes multiple days on, visa versa whenever i feel like gettin high af and playing some fortnite with my homies, and of course trying to avoid getting any wd symptoms....... NOW due to this i have no tolerance but i still find it hard to get the desired high i want from my tar...  here are some questions im sure you geniuses would love to answer for me. Thanks and happy noddin

1. How much should I put on my foil when i smoke, i usually put .01 to .1 at mosttttt, now should i be putting more onto the foil and is that why I'm not getting super high?

2. Now my tar neverrr rolls. It never leaves a trail it just turns to ash
 ((( I have decent tar most of my sacs I THINK    
  i usually get anywhere from .2 to 1g depending on how long i want it to last AND the quality differs mildy,)))  
 but is this because off the quality of my tar?? Or could it pretain to my previous question and just be solved by putting more

3. I also usually smoke some h... wait a minute and smoke some weed. Then before i go to bed like an hour to 2 later i smoke h again. Is this a good strategy or am i literaly just blowin threw my stash to not feel any more euphoria by redosing. 

Number 1 and 2 are my main concern as i feel like i am wasting lots and lotsss of money, if you dont want to read that whole essay in simple terms.... HOW MUCH H DO I PUT ON THE FOIL AND HOW COME MY H DONT DO NO GODAMN TRAILS",1527048082.0

I have been doing codeine for 9 months straight once a week already \(and still not addicted, no withdrawals or anything if i skip a dose. Must be lucky or something\)

Anywho, i was looking for a way to potentiate the codeine i have. Tried looking up for some gluthimide substitutes and if they're available, but to no avail. Next best thing that won't kill ya is dexamethasone, so i made up a bullshit story for the pharmacists about an asthma emergency and bought 10x 0,5mg strip for about 2 euros, extracted my dose of codeine and was prepared for a trip, but lost a strip of antihistamines i had, but since i've been doing this for quite a while the histamine reaction didn't really affect me all that much anymore except for the regular itch here and there, so thought i could take it. Boy was i about to have a really unpleasant experience:

1st attempt

6:00am \- drank 3 dexamethasone tablets

7:30am \- drank 2 dexamethasone tablets

the only reason i've did this is that i read sketchty reports that dexamethasone can take anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours to work, so i thought i'll space it out to get the enzymes working the most they can.

8:00am \- drank codeine with some sodium carbonate water \(to remove acids from stomach, so more gets to the digestive tract\)

8:10am \- feeling the opiate come up, damn, doesn't usually start this fast.

8:30am \- the histamine reaction came in

9:00am \- by now this was the worst histamine reaction i've experienced ever, period, it felt like i was walking on needles. My entire ARM was bloated, the itching was unbearable.

9:10am \- found a clemestine tablet, drank it. Thank God.

the itching subsidied after half an hour, and the high kinda remained. I couldn't really appreciate it a lot due to the itching and me disregarding anthisitamines, but you could say that the unusual histamine reaction i had was a tip off that it worked.

The opiate hight lasted somewhere until 11:00am, then i took a few gabapentin capsules and nodded the rest of my day, going about my usual business/band practices and socializing. Was a wonderful day overall.

2nd attempt

Took 5 days off for my tolerance to reset to see if i had the same results, this time lowering dexamethasone intake for control

11:00pm \- took 1 dexamethasone tablets

12:00pm \- took another one, same as above

12:30pm \-  took codeine with some antacids, and took 1 cetirizine tablet with it

12:45pm \- again, codeine kicks in WAY faster than before. Holy shit the rush is amazing

13:00pm \- went on a date, bought some extra codeine while high on codeine for the future, heh

15:00pm \- high ended, took some gabbies to enhance the afterglow and went on my day socializing as usual \(that's usually the only reason i take oppies tbh\)

I took a much lesses dose this time, the rush was really simmilar, but the high didn't last as long as the first one. Can't tell if it was due to the dexamethasone or my natural bodies phenomenon \(you know, with the codeine being a prodrug and all\)

Verdict: Dexamethasone did potentiate my codeine, for what it's worth. Tt gave a much stronger rush and extended it's action by a bit, quite noticeably than the last time i did codeine without it. If i had to give it an estimae on how much it improved the trip overall it would be somewhere around 15\-20&#37; but now i need another control group after this experience. Can't say that it did miracles, though. If you're really in a pinch and need to make the best out of the opiate supply you've got then have no doubt \- dexamethasone does work. But if you have a choice and getting opiates is less of a problem/not that expensive \( a 300mg pack of codeine costs 2,30 euros for me\) then i would just recommend getting more opiates, since opiates don't really have a ceilling dose, contrary to popular belief. \+ dexamethasone might be able to cause nasty side effects if taken long term, since it's an immunosupressant, so i wouldn't recommend it as a long term solution.

Regardless of the outcome, i will get back to ya'll on this quite soon, since i'm gonna try codeine without the dexamethasone after a break to see if i still get the same rush \(can't rule out the possibility of a strong placebo, brain does work wonders when ya biased\)",1527024457.0

Can somebody help me with getting on subs or whatever is supposed to help.,"I have never asked for help like this but the money buying this shit off the streets is getting too expensive. I have stopped on my own a few times this last year but always get pulled back in. I have been taking pain meds since 15(21 years) when my kneecap started dislocating on me. Around 2001 I had the hook up on however many Lorcet, Lortab I wanted all the way up until 2008(I ate at least one every hour for that whole time). I lost that connect for a few months, had a crazy wreck and totaled my car and ate the hundred Darvocet in 2 to 3 days. I went back to the doctor and he gave me Lorcet up until about 2014 when he stopped doing scripts for those and put me on Tylenol 4 ever since.

Well anybody who knows what all that is like knows T4's ain't shit and I'm just wasting money. Not only that but im wasting money on the streets. I feel empty and like I can't do shit but lay in bed when I don't have pills. I'd like to stop or if I need them to be productive get a better script. Does suboxin and shit like that work and if so how do I get them? Also if there is some way I can get a higher dose by doing something can somebody point that out to me please?

My right knee has popped out of place randomly over a hundred times while my left has at least 30. My back feels broken and I'm sure it's not a neck strain they diagnosed me with after giving me morphine and releasing me. It still hurts everyday and feels like its one wrong move from snapping. I can't even lay on either side.

8ldhv4,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8ldhv4/my_path_down_the_opiate_road/,3,https://redd.it/8ldhv4,Kylerdub,My path down the opiate road.,"So, first of all this is a new account because my other account is relatively active and ive never really mentioned this side of my life on it and would rather keep it that way.  


First things first, I'm a 26 y/o male residing in canada. The only time i had ever taken opiates in my life is when I crashed my motorcycle at 20 y/o, the hospital i was transported to gave me 5 percocets for the pain for the next few days \(5/325\). Never went out of my way to find more but when buddies had some percs i would take them occasionally.   


 Fast forward about two years later, I tore my knee apart. Grade 3 MCL tear, ACL tear and Meniscus tear. Docs gave me tramadol for the pain when it first happened but they made me feel sick and didn't really help the pain. They gave me a script for 30 more percocets until i could get into surgery. Had the surgery and was sent home with 50 more percocets. I was in so much pain i had to take 2\-3 every 4 hours just to be able to tolerate it. I would even wake up in the middle of the night in so much pain so i would reach for the bottle and take another 2\-3 and go back to sleep.   


Pain started to subside after around a month and i was walking better but still hurt as they said it would take a few months for the pain to fully go away. It never went away and now i am looking at early onset arthritis in my knee which isn't uncommon for these types of surgeries and knee injuries. I then was given a monthly prescription for the same percocets. 60/month and was instructed to use them only when i needed them. \(we all know how this goes\)  


Well i didn't use them when I only needed them for pain, i started using them all the time taking up to 10 \-12 per day. They didn't last long. I had to get blood work done and my tests came back i had a high liver enzyme which was due to my excessive drinking and painkillers. Stopped drinking completely but still lied and complained to my doc that my knee still hurt \( it still did hurt but not nearly as much as i was telling him\) He then put me on more oxycodone 10Mg without the acetaminophen in hope to help my liver. This is where it started to get worse and worse.    


Since there was no APAP in these ones, i started to sniff them. Sniffing one, swallowing one. Multiple times a day. Doc filled up my script twice and when i went back to Go see my doctor for the third time he had had retired i guess or moved but the receptionist didn't care to elaborate. The new doc \(younger female dr that looked like she just got out of med school\) will not prescribe me anymore and was frankly surprised and angry that i have been taking so many and my previous doctor would even allow me to get that many. \(here in canada it seems like they are way more stingy to prescribe oxy now after all of the abuse.\) They even switched most of the oxy to Oxyneo to help battle the abuse here. Cant get them prescribed so turn to the streets, found some 20mg oxys from a plug and he had upwards of 300 of them. I must have bought at least 150 of them to last me a while and now they have finally ran out . He can't get more of them and i do not trust anyone else because of the recent fent pills going around in my city.    


Im going to attempt to stop doing them all together, After being on them for more than 14 months and usually averaging 60\-80mg a day I'm concerned with how my W/D are going to be. Ive never battled withdrawals from opiates because I've been on them daily for a year straight. I have battled withdrawals from alcohol when i was drinking a litre or more of vodka a day for around 8 months and those were absolutely horrible, it felt like i would feel better if i was dead than having to deal with them.  


I am legitimately scared on how these W/D are going to be, I'm scared I'm going to relapse and buy tainted pills or something because of the feeling of being unwell.   


TL;DR \- Docs got me hooked on oxy after surgery, haven't been able to stop but going to try and attempt to stop tomorrow.",1527022225.0

That's what I would be saying if I was still doing stupid things. Last week I got paid, had to pay one $80ish debt and then had the rest of my money left for bike parts and incidentals. Cliff was hoping and expecting me to get subs but I didn't put any effort in or even share any of my own this time. He was given the option to fund subs for himself a number of times prior but he kept postponing and decided to spend his money on other things. If I share any subs with him or loan him any with my own money, I'm basically sending the message that it's okay to have no foresight and rewarding such behavior. Furthermore, he certainly wouldn't pay me back with subs or cash. If I'm attempting to follow my own recovery program, trading my personal supply of subs for roxies is probably not a good idea. It's not conducive to recovery.

Cliff is looking forward to script day, and will likely get someone else to pick up the script in order to be able to get someone with a car to pick up multiple bottles of soda among other necessities. I've made it pretty clear I'm not interested, that I don't want to get in on that script.

He'll want to graciously give me two free pills and knowing that I can't just have two will offer to lend me more until pay day. He already did. He has to go to the doctor on Wednesday and pick up the script on Saturday. If I do get in on this, I'll reset my suboxone taper just because of one day of partying and by partying I mean doin pills that aren't even as good as dope. If I'm gonna do something ""bad"", I might as well do it right. Then of course I would be indebting myself the following week. If I owe Cliff $100, he'll surely ask to borrow a little more. Why even bother putting myself in that position?

Last time I got pills, it sucked. I ate a couple, snorted a bunch and tried to finish all of them before too late and just got sick from it. Not terribly sick just nauseous and ughish. I do so love not being entangled in the various games that come with the territory. I wouldn't have a solid taper schedule or supply of subs if I didn't stop going along with all of the bullshit games and listenign to my instincts. I couild have shared subs with Cliff numerous times since last week but it's not like he cared to get them when he had the money.

So this coming week, he'll hope to get me on board to take on some 15mg roxies on loan but I don't see the value comapred to continuing my suboxone taper plan and getting as low as possible. It would be harder to say no if he was offering to loan me dope but the repercussions would be similar. We'll see how it pans out. I'm curous to hear what Cliff says to entice me to get on board. Surely, whatever he thinks I want to hear. Any time I appear serious about clocking out of the game and being running partners with Cliff, he ups his offers. Like that time where he offered me a half a bun to bike to the ATM with his card instead of the normal .2 of a bun he offered prior.

So I can go on, get loaned some pills this Saturday and put myself behind by $100 before pay day. Alternatively, I can keep taking my subs, get below 2mg.. keep it going. Of course as far as Cliff is concerned I have nothing. No dope, pills or subs. If he asks how I'm doing so well, I'll just tell him I took a fist full of DXM \(which I do have stocked up\) even though I'm still on subs. If he thinks I have none, he can't ask me or beg me for any in his time of need.

I am carefully rationing my supply. I have a couple of those old people pill cases with compartments for the days of the week and I found my late mother's pill cutter which allows me to get clean and fairly precise cuts of Suboxone pills down to 1/8 size. The compartmental case allows me to physically plot my daily dosage, sort of like a physical representation of a spreadsheet. To top things off, I got my hands on two fresh 8mg strips from another friend for some weed. 

So I'm looking forward to following through and facing what comes my way. I don't think I'll get paid enough to be able to waste it on dope so I'm trying to avoid considering that option for next week's pay day. I bought some nitric oxide to back me up in order to prcent symptoms of ""stage fright"" for when I attract women in the comming weeks. That's for another post, and I've already wrote part of it but I'm finalizing the science, research and empirical results for said post.

You know, there have just been times where I get invited to a bar to see some friends and decline because I don't have money left over after buying dope. I'm just really happy though, that I am not scraping along. If I didn't have subs, I'd be seeking a variety of means to get some relief and would have no money to do it. That's why I stocked up on subs and DXM. I still haven't used DXM for anything but a cold but the theory of use makes sense. 

Shit, I still have to fix up a power cord for Cliff's Macbook before script day. If I don't he'll remind me and say ""paid for this computer in full"", yes for once he paid for something. Of course his carelessness is overlooked. When I loaned him a second spare power cord \(one in shit condition because I wasn't going to let him ruin a good one\) I told him he needed to take good care of it and he assured me he would. That he doesn't throw the computer at the floor or do anything to damage or wear out the power cord. Then there was that last time he was barred out and I literally saw him toss the plugged\-in Macbook onto the floor. Point is, many people will promise and claim they take care of shit when they obviously don't. I'm taking my time fixing the power cord because I want it to sink in that it's his fault, not mine and that if he doesn't take care of his shit that next time he'll have to wait an eternity to get it fixed.

It's like when someone spills soda on a laptop, then it works for two days and when it stops two days later you blame the soda but the user is like ""but it worked after I spilled soda on it."" :::face palm::: .... \(corrosion, and science\) Beyond that, Cliff's house is a pile of garbage, not conducive to taking good care of shit. Well maybe ""shit"", because there's plenty of places for his dog to shit. There's brown spots all over his floor where dog shit was picked up, there are other areas where he advises, ""watch your step"" and the electricity is still turned off. Cable TV is back on but power has been out for over two weeks. His house smells more like raw garbage as the humidity rises and I wouldn't even want to open his refrigerator. 

Then there's the bed bugs, if I keep doing dope and keep hanging out with Cliff frequently, I'll just get bed bugs in my house again. I already had thwarted a close call last year and I don't want to repeat that shit. I got very lucky and acted fast. Now, every time I go to Cliff's house I go through a decontamination procedure. No matter how tired I am, DECON! Luckily I haven't hung out at Cliff's in the past couple of weeks, between my business and his lack of drugs. When Cliff is dope\-sick, or has nothing to take after the worst of it is over, he just stays in his bed and watches TV. His mom likely yells at him from across the house, things like ""did money man come over yet?"" Cliff often lies about other people owing him money to be delivered to appease his mom and then pushes the goal post up when she remembers. 

Shit, I don't remember what I wanted to share with you readers... I guess I just wanted to check in and say that I'll put a little more effort into following my recovery action plan than I have in the past. Partially due to financial constraints, but also because summer is approaching. All winter I told myself that's it's too cold to quit all opioids, that I'll do it in the spring. There may be anxiety and hyper\-algesia for some but the hardest thing aside from anxiety is the bite of the cold. Take the cold out of the equation, I can manage the rest with a good solid biking regiment. 

Hence the reason I must keep my costs down, so I can finish replacing worn components on my bike and upgrade it a bit. With said parts, I safely can do a thousand miles before the end of August. With every 10\-20 mile day of cycling, natural endorphins will  be produced. Hopefully I can repair the mis\-wiring of my brain and get back on track with other productive activities that make me happy.

I'm at my hematologist's office. Getting IV Fluids, and hopefully some Ativan and Torodol too. Working on asking the right people here for the meds I need. I broke protocol and hit up the guy closest to the doctor here because fuck I need the medications badly.

I was on hundred mg methadone, cut down to forty waited a week with no methadone, light H use, waited 12 hours took 2 mg suboxone and was thrown into worst PWD of my life. Had like 4/5 on COWS scale if I had to guess. My urine showed methadone still in my system. 

After taking 2mg after about 5 minutes I was having violent shaking through body like cotton fever bit, lower back felt like it was getting hit with a hot iron, then vomiting started and shaking on bathroom floor for hours and hours until I ha energy to get up, I used H yesterday to take the pain away but could tell suboxone was blocked some effects.

My question is I have used some H today but want to stop all together but if I took another 2mg would I be fine? Bupe is dominate on receptor site and half life is long so I'd say I have 1mg floating around. It's been over 24 hours since last suboxone use. I want to take the suboxone so it stays in my system and I can just stop using the H but do you think I will go into WD again or should be ok because it's already on receptors?

I am a long term opiate addict. I am writing this to maybe help someone or inform them about my experience with the OTC drug loperamide. Loperamide is contained in Imodium, it is readily available. Three years ago I found myself in a bad situation facing impending withdrawal due to my source being cut off. Loperamide is an opiate that use to be scheduled and prescribed. Many think it just works in the GI tract and at low therapeutic doses it does just that. However when a large dose (30-60mg depending) is taken it will cross the blood brain barrier causing it to permeate and become centrally acting. It will take every withdrawal symptom away. I thought it was miraculous that I could spend eight bucks for 200 and my opiate addiction was satiated. I continued to take loperamide for the past 3 years, never wanting to get high or take any other opiate. I found my use slowly escalating from 60mg to at its peak 190mg(80 pills). I started taking Xanax to lower my tolerance and ended up getting physically dependent on the benzo and my use escalated to an awful 20mg a day habit. I was able to cut down the lope to 70mg. A few months ago I began shooting H to transition from the long acting lope(which I only had to dose once a day, at the beginning only every other day). I was not able to fully become dependent on the H due to a situation that forced me to come clean about my use. I had tapered the Xanax down to 8mg a day. I ended up going to treatment. I was very precise and clear about the lope, which they had never treated. I spent 7 days in a detox unit being given phenobarbital(for the Xanax withdrawal) and suboxone for the opiate/lope withdrawal. I do not wish this on my worst enemy as it was pain and insanity simultaneously. I am writing this to warn people about long term lope use. It is been over 40 days since I checked in and am out. I have to take propanalol for my heart rate which is 145 when I wake up. I am still sweaty, depressed, GI issues, restlessness. It is akin to methadone withdrawal. I have wanted to get on suboxone but know it will prolong this dependency and I will eventually have to come off it. The neurotoxicity of lope has not been studied. My cognitive abilities are coming back but I fear for any permanent damage. Please stay away from loperamide as it is much harder than any opiate withdrawal I have been through. If you must use it to get out of withdrawal just use it sparingly. It will become a daily habit soon due to the availability and cost. Save yourself from the experiment I conducted on myself. Good luck.",1527003380.0

I mean I’ll go hard for a long run and then decide my life is in the shitter and fix it up, go a while, and then back again. My last run was the worst when I was spending $2000/day to simply stay well at approximately this time last year and I was in the lowest point I’d ever gotten myself into. Fortunately my family stood by despite all the using, lying, thieving, etcetera, and my wife had my back, but despite all that it’s amazing how quickly it all comes back and the lying could be so easy to start again... even after all the positive shit I’ve done since. I don’t think them demons ever leave your brain. I went to rehab for three months last year, have spent over $150,000 getting clean in total, changed my number, felt ready for anything. Even ropi doesn’t trigger me. But in my inbox my guy (as I met him on reddit in the good old sub long gone now) has sent me several messages recently, saying “the boss” was asking about the regular (aka the scary dudes in the trap with automatic rifles that I met a few times when with him during reup) and I find myself having to suddenly work harder than a mutherfucker to fight those demons whispering heroin in the back of my head.

I have detoxed at home 10\+ times from the opes but have never made it through a benzo withdrawal \(HELL\) without cracking....

I need to detox under medical supervision because I am seizure prone so it is very high risk for me to come off of benzos.. \(my doctor said it would literally kill me a lot easier than most people\)

I would like to rapid taper the opiates first then the benzos....

I have tapered both my benzo and opiate doses down below a 1/3 \(and switched from tar to kratom btw\) of what I was taking in January and I am dead set on getting clean!! I have been using both for more than 4 years btw and had other concurrent addictions that I have dropped a long the way... These are the last 2 habbits to drop, due to never being able to make it through how hellacious benzo withdrawals are...

I dont want to return to using drugs at all I really want to get clean!! I got rid of all friends who do drugs in my life and will be only placing myself in healthy environments in the future.

Ok I have a lot of questions:

How can I make the most out of this experience and set myself up for success??

Where the staff nice to you and helpful??

I want to be essentially anesthetized and unaware for the whole experience is it okay to tell the staff this???

Any tips going in?

I know what works well for myself in withdrawal \(baclofen, GHB, lyrica, marinal, ketamine, and soma\) can I give the this list or will they even listen to me?

Should I bring my own pills in I am scared they will screw me and just give me clonodine or some shit, if they don't help me enough I know myself, I will discharge myself, walk out and will have wasted my entire savings on a detox that: felt crappy, didn't even work, and be back to square 1 still addicted....

I don’t think it was near the severity of a medical emergency, as I was still able to squeeze out some turds around it, but I’m 100% sure of the diagnosis. Basically I could feel it in my colon for a week and a half, but couldn’t squeeze it out. 

I tried everything.  Miralax. Stool softeners. Suppository. Castor oil (I still gag thinking about that). Putting lube up my ass. Trying to reach a finger in there to break it up. NOTHING worked. It was starting to affect my quality of life. I was miserable. 

I was about to go to the doctor. Basically I had resigned myself to the fact that a medical professional was going to have to spelunk my asshole to break it down and get it out. The thought was terrifying. 

After countless hours of googling, I came across a recommendation for something called Oxy Powder. 

Sorry fellow junkies, despite the word “oxy” in the name, it’s in no way related to a narcotic. 

I read that it breaks down hard and impacted stools, to serve its main function of cleaning out the digestive system. 

I figured what the hell, it can’t hurt. I’ll try anything at this point. I ordered a bottle of 20 on Amazon, and paid the extra $5 for next day shipping. 

I ate 4 capsules last night, per the directions, along with a lot of water. 

I woke up this morning pessimistic, as I wasn’t feeling the urge to dump that the product description led me to believe I would be feeling. 

I lazily got a cup of coffee. Sat down. Wanted to cry, I was so uncomfortable. 

5 minutes later, the urge hit. I walked to the bathroom, saying a prayer to a God I’m not sure I believe in anymore. 

I sat down. And the magic happened. That rock hard turd slid out like toothpaste being squeezed out of the tube. It was still very hard and compact, but something was different. It actually moved. 

At first, I thought it was too good to be true. It must have been another load that once again made its way around the impaction. The only way to tell was to bear down, and squeeze those muscles together. 

I squeezed. I felt nothing. The large mass that was so uncomfortable, for so long, was no longer there. 

I cried. I shit you not. Legit cried. Tears of happiness. 

If you feel like you can’t clear that shit out, try OxyPowder. I won’t guarantee you that it will work. But I think it’s worth $10 to give it a shot. 

No, I do not work for them or endorse them in any official capacity. I’m just a junkie who couldn’t shit right. And OxyPowder saved my ass. Literally. ",1526996933.0

I'ma 28 year old male and have been doing opiates for about 11 years and recently started dabbling with fent presses. 
I have never been clean for more than 3 weeks in that time. 
It was never everyday for extended amounts of time because of money problems. I'm more of a binge addict because I have no problem taking 30 Roxie's In 3 days, bumping small amounts of fent and drinking and doing benzos. 
After that I may go a week til pay day with only weed and alcohol so I don't really know how physically addicted I am because the withdrawals aren't too bad, as long as there are a bunch of other substances.  No where near as bad as opanas or the months of poppy seed tea but that was years ago
 But I'm 100% mentally addicted.
To make things worse in November I broke my arm because I was skateboarding to the corner store on Klonopin and 32oz king kobra malt liquor and I was going to get more like an idiot half blacked out and I broke my elbow and coller bone 
since I don't have insurance I went to the Dr once after the er visit and the recommend a cast but because of insurance and money issues I left with an arm brace and and sixty 5 mg oxycodones and four 2 mg Dilaudid. I was never albe to go back to the Dr and now of course 6 months later I'm still in pain alot of daily pain and my elbow is messed up pretty bad and a friend's dad who was a foot Dr so not exactly his specialty but he said he would recommend it be rebroke and reset. 
Now adding being legitimately in pain daily and ruined my opiates usuage. I've started knowing buying fent pressed blue oxys because normal oxy does help and they are everywhere but of course because of money I don't do them daily.
I really want to some how get of some sort of replacement med. But I don't know if I have to go to the Dr after I use? Or can I go the week or 10-15 days I'm clean from opiates? 
Ive learned I'm powerless trying to quit with my own with kratom or gabapentin or pst or benzos and alcohol or anything and now that I have legitimate pain I have to take something to deal with the pain and i don't want to do fent pressed anymore  or opiate binges or my fingers going numb all the time and not being able to make a tight fist with alot of pain in my elbow. 
Do I have to be withdrawing to try and get these meds? I've taken subutex recently and I was able to make a whole one last 4 days and was never high and i was in zero pain and had zero urge to redose or even get high. I have taken 2 full ones before and got extremely high do I understand it can do that but that not what I want anymore. 
How should I go about getting something that will help me and I don't know if subutex or suboxe or methadone or what would be great or any at all. I just know the behavior I've been doing for 10 years plus needs to end but I can't deal with the pain sober. I'm not sure what or how to do anything.

 I got 5250d which is a 14 day hold. Stayed in a shitty looney bin for 6 days. All while bein givin 3 10 mg k56 every 4 hours. The MD’s at the looney bin were surprisingly script happy idk why. They even offered me morphine but I was aiming for getting 30s you feel me?

The group sessions were boring but the spot was dope. Vig ass tv perfect for watchin the warriors jn the playoffs. 

Anyway, I cracked some ribs and broke my collarbone so Ive been givin like over 200 oxy over this time period. I know this because the psych md at the house pulled the ultimate homie move and moved me up to 40 mg every 4 hours or some shit! But the pharmacist at Kaiser denied it and that is how I know Ifound out from him that im the 200+ range...

I stayed in that house for a cool minute, sitting through group and personal therapy sessions about being sober and controlling your actions, all the while high on Oxy through all of it because of my dumbass injury lol,

The DSM-5, which I believe is the most up to date diagnostic representation of psychological disorders states that addiction is indeed a disease(I may be wrong here, this was just what we used when I was in college). I haven't poured through the data myself, but nonetheless, it's in there. Here's my problem, stating that addiction is a disease gives us another reason to justify our using of our DOC. It's true that those with an addiction DO have mental and physical processes that exacerbate the using of drugs (anxiety, depression, pain, fear), to name a few. Also, there are brain scans that show that addicts do have different patterns than those of non-users. Yet, as far as I know, and based off of all the research I've done, there aren't any studies that show that those particular patterns exist PRIOR to the addiction taking place.  Of course, anxiety and depression can be the reason someone might turn to drugs, but isn't that the disease? Yes, we know that there are certain genes that can be inherited that make one more likely to become an alcoholic for example, this has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. BUT, these recessive genes aren't expressed unless they are turned on. Can't the argument be made that these expressions are simply a result of environment? For example, if a person had the alcoholic gene, if that person lived in a place where alcohol was never available, they wouldn't ever become an alcoholic. As an ex-addict(opiates), it always bugged me when the therapist would say ""firstly, let me tell you that what you have is a disease"". It seems like a cop out, like a way to tell yourself and others that what happened to you wasn't your fault. I never wished to become and addict, growing up I never even considered becoming an addict was a possibility, yet, like so many others, it happened. But it's not like one day I just woke up and needed to go get some heroin, it was a long process. Maybe it's more that some of us just have that little switch in our brain that makes it more difficult to quit things, an addictive personality as some might call it. But having an addictive personality doesn't directly result in addiction, again, i feel it's a result of the environment we live in. A disease can be something we're born with, a disease can be something that one day we wake up with. Indeed, environmental factors CAN cause diseases(one can be more hereditarily prone to skin cancer for example, yet if they don't go in the sun too often it won't ever happen).  Although I'm ashamed of it, I believe that my addiction was entirely my fault. I wasn't in a bad place at the time, in fact, I was at one of the highest points of my life. I had just finished college, I had a great job and was making tons of money. Having all that money allowed me to get all the drugs I wanted, and mainly, I just enjoyed the feeling of getting fucked up. I loved LSD (any entheogens actually), ketamine, every pill I could get my hands on, alcohol, weed, actually I can't really think of a drug I didn't like and I've nearly tried them all( I know there are a shit ton of new RC's that I haven't tried, so many I don't think anyone's tried them all), but you catch my drift. I just think us addicts need to take responsibility for our actions in every single form we can, without putting the blame on anything else. Whether addiction is a disease or not, and it very well may be, it's our job to see why we do what we do. Telling ourselves that we have a disease simply makes it easier to tell ourselves ""I can't quit"", ""I have a disease, and it's the disease that's eating at me"", ""it's not all my fault, my grandpa was an alcoholic too"".  We already have enough excuses and justifications, ""I'm hurt and this helps"", ""I just do it for fun"", ""I'm not worth shit anyway, so why quit""?.  What do you guys/gals think? Is there any reason that we should continue to tell ourselves we have a disease, or is this just another justification? Please keep it nice everybody, I know this can be a touchy issue and I'd really love to hear everyone's opinion. If you believe it is a disease, can you elaborate a bit as to why? If not, what do you believe brought you to the point of addiction? 
Thanks for reading, and I value all opinions.

Idea to help those either using, stopping, PAWS, etc. Most Opiates hit the mu receptors in your brain, causing down-regulation of the density or amount of active receptor sites for these, which is responsible for withdrawal and PAWs (as most of you already know)... Well; Heat Exposure Therapy, I.E. Sauna Use (15-25 Min. Preferably) Or Hot Yoga (Even Better Cuz Exercise Too) Stimulates The Kappa Receptors In Your 'Knoggin. These are essentially your brains counter balance system to the mu side, which is why heat/kappa stimulation causes unpleasent feelings.

Now- The stimulation of kappa receptors promotes the regeneration/sensitization of the mu side, which is very helpful for tolerance, PAWS, recovery, all of the above. Just thought it'd be helpful for yall strugglin, PEACE!",1526941019.0

While I've been a poly user of several drugs throughout life, the most hellish of all being benzos and withdrawing off of them, I've never used prescription opiates or h. Only sold them.

I'd typically throw myself into a pot and Benzo haze every morning before my white collar programmer job, then at night my nights would be filled with more bud, some sort of Benzo, and flipping all sorts of drugs I could get my hands on to make a profit off of.

Out of all the substances and drugs I used to sell, the one I regret by far the most is opiates. Never have I had so many people begging me for some sort of relief, and if they were female and didn't have money, roughly 9 out of 10 times I'd be offered sex, head, anal, whatever for a couple Roxy 30s. As a nerdy younger male, this worked great for me in my 20s, but now as I age I regret ever accepting any of the sexual favors that were given to me over time. Now i have dealt with Benzo  (Xanax) addiction personally, so I do know what it's like to withdraw and feel terrible, but I'm assuming the degree of opiate withdrawal is sadly that much higher than other drugs.

My main reason for posting was to see if any of you were former dboys or dealers that took advantage of the opiate epidemic similar to the way I did? Selling ya buddy some green and a couple of hydro 10s is one thing, but people trading me cars for entire scripts of dilaudid is very much another in which I now regret the way I acted over the years.

Three months ago my GP changed practices, so Dr Suse hired two new fresh out of university student doctors so they could do their on sore training. I think mine learned a very valuable lesson. So on my first visit with her, I told her I'd like fortnightly fills becuse no matter what I do, I can just never make a whole month.. She was cool with it, handed me the magic papers, writing on them as she did... 80mg Cr night time, 40mg Cr + 20mg Cr breakfast.... You can imagine how she reacted to my request for so many pills, oh and I'd better get my 60 20mg oxynorm today to... ""Come back in 14 days and I will dispense another 28 of each of the SANDOZ generic....

This went on a few times, I don't know HOW she didn't realise, I mean she literally wrote out how many pills to take and gave me double that... 

WELL.... to begin with it was fat tastic! I even jammed a 5*80 shot in a 3ml and holy shit did it fuck me....

Anyway now for the downfall.... I had to take my disabled daughter to see a GP at same clinic, Nd I needed some rizatraptan for migraines. Anyway as soon as she saw the amount of oxy I was getting, strait to the head boss/owner....

When I went in for this fortnights app, I know I was gunna get it, first was I selling it? Nah.... OK I'm obviously using too many, why? Because my spine is fusing and I'm fucking sore, shit....

Have a got a problem with the pills? Well it's more a problem with the pain and trying to walk the line of pain relief and 'who gives a fuck about pain' - definitely not easy when you are getting 3 * 28ct boxes every 14 days...

In the end I'm assuming head Dr, Dr Suse kept me on because I've been there for ages, knows my daughter and how much I do for her... I assume he had final say overall.. 

So I got cut from SANDOZ crushable to targin instead 60mg twice daily, and 2*20mg norms per night.. I have to have weekly compliance checks and fills from same pharmacy till she trusts me again... 

I feel terrible that I abused our relationship for so long, she was almost crying last appointment, and lost it when she realised I should have another 3 months worth of oxy-nope I took it....

Have her again on we'd, gunna thank her for pulling my head in n giving me a chance to still get pain killers... Rather than cutting me adrift like so many other Drs would have... 

I'm such an asshole. It's her first work placement and I could have fucked her carer big time, lucky Dr Boss knows what's up and gave me a pass as well as her.

Or have the chemistry knowledge to say whether or not it should work, even on tar?","I find it odd that after looking often for a purification TEK, suddenly finding one that supposedly works on tar and powdered dope is easy as 1 Google Search. 

It's credited back to like 2002, and Erowid.org has notes about how if you've got fentanyl-mixed heroin, you shouldn't do this (as that cut is gone and you'll OD). 

Looks like supplies needed are:

1. Glassware
2. HcL 28% (ish?)
3. Pipettes or Eye Droppers
4. Household Ammonia
5. Ethyl Ether
6. Baking Soda


Here is the TEK, cut and pasted from Erowid:

This is as complete and as accurate as I can remember, it has been something like 9 years since I have used heroin. The process I used for purification was straight forward. Diacetylmorphine can exist in two forms, an insoluble base, or a soluble salt. Often it contained a plethera of other agents like pieces of broken glass, pieces of foil, dirt, wood, metal, mannitol, lactose, maltose, sand, you get the idea. The first stage of the process I used was to make sure the diacetylmorphine I received was totally converted to a soluble hydrochloride salt. The heroin I usually received was a brown powdered heroin, sometimes off white, very little vinegar smell. Today all you can find is a black crud that reeks with a vinegar (acetic) odor. The way I made sure it was a soluble salt was to drop enough 28% hydrochloric acid to make it wet. This insured that I would not waste any of the available drug, but would remove most if not all of the cut. I think that it would be better for me to detail it in a procedural manner. FYI, hydrochloric acid can be purchased in gallon jugs at hardware stores under the name Muriatic acid, 28%.

First weigh out one gram of heroin from the stock you received from your supplier. Place this gram into a 13 x 100mm test tube. Add a few drops of 28% hydrochloric acid until it is evenly damp. Allow to react for a minute or two. Next add 5 ml distilled water, place your thumb over the end and carefully shake to dissolve all that will dissolve into the water. Allow the insolubles to settle. Using a pipette, remove and transfer as much of the liquid to a fresh test tube leaving the solids behind. Dispose of the undissolved remains in the first test tube. Slowly add via pipette, one drop at at time, ammonium hydroxide (water clear household ammonia) until the white precipitate ceases production. Add several more drops at this point just to be sure. Shake gently to be sure that all the solution is evenly ammoniated. The solution should look milky. Now add 100 ml ethyl ether (some kinds of diesel starting fluids, read the label) to a 150 ml beaker. Dump the milky liquid into the ether and stir briskly and allow the water to settle and collect on the bottom. The water will turn clear. Using a glass pipette, remove this water from the bottom of the beaker and dispose of. 

Now mix up a solution of 5ml 28% hydrochloric acid and 5ml distilled water and add this to the ether in the beaker. Stir briskly keeping as much acid/water suspended as possible for several minutes. Allow the water/acid to collect on the bottom of the beaker. Using a glass pipette, remove this water layer from the bottom of the ether and transfer to a glass petri dish. Transfer the ether back to its storage bottle for reuse. It will still contain small amounts of heroin base, so don't throw it out. Recycle! Slowly add small portions of sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) to the water/acid solution in the petri until you don't notice any more bubbles being formed. Place the glass on a warm surface, and allow to evaporate. The residue will be diacetylmorphine hydrochloride and salt. Table salt is a by-product of the reaction and will not hurt you at all when injected. Scrape up the residue and weigh it. Yield from one gram of smack (yea, we called it that) would be anything from 100 to 300 mg, rarely more. Place 100 mg of this powder in a test tube, add 10 cc sterile isotonic water for injection (available OTC at drug stores) and heat to boiling. Transfer this liquid while still hot using a syringe (available OTC at some drug stores) to a 10 ml rubber stoppered empty sterile ampoule (available OTC at drug stores).

To use this drug which is 10 mg/ml, extract with a sterile syringe as much drug as you wish to use. 10 mg would send me flying believe it or not. 2.5 mg (1/4 cc) was usually enough to keep me ""happy"" and was my normal dose. 20 mg was the most I could take safely in my opinion, and was a waste of drug and money. Normally, for most 150-170 lb males, 2.5 mg is more than enough in my opinion. Using heroin in this manner avoids the problems associated with ""street use"" and will keep your body healthy and safe, reducing the risk of disease and overdosage.

My memory is pretty good, and I think I covered all the bases here, but I may have made a mistake somewhere. Overall I think this is an accurate method, to the best of my ability to remember.


Obviously ether is a watched chemical, and I have my doubts that it just works so well in what, 4 steps or so with some filtering via pipettes, but I don't know much about chemistry. 

Anybody here able to vouch for this, or use their chem know-how to confirm/deny that it should work? Does it clean up poorly synth'd stuff, and always leave you with #4 and salt? 

So many questions, and I have none of the answers. Thanks to anybody who takes the time to read this and contribute answers or info, it's tempting if it's legit.

Then she gave me flexiril and naproxen.

Couldn't freely think or move. Then I'd slowly come back to my senses, with thought organizing again and me regaining control of my body. It literally felt like my brain and reality was glitching/crashing.

Afterwards, I'd feel my entire body pulsating for a couple of seconds, I'd get weird euphoric feelings and it felt like my brain did a ""restart"". It lasted only a few seconds every time, and it probably happened about 20 times or more, although it has yet to happen again since that night.

I started repeating the behavior, getting the ""seizure"" each time, because it had powerful dissociative, euphoric and ""rush"" effects, however I'm now realizing how that may be dangerous. Why did I get those ""seizures"" and could it have hurt me in any way?

EDIT: I just have to add that I've never had a seizure, so I do not know how it feels like, nor do I have epilepsy as far as I know.",1526927612.0

There are so many anecdotal and theoretical answers on this, it's insane.

Question 1 - **does calcium carbonate or dextromethorphan (dxm) potentiate codeine?**

Question 2 - **does magnesium, calcium carbonate or anything similar potentiate OR reduce tolerance to dexamphetamine?**

Please only answer if you **know** through extensive experience the answer to these questions. **I know different people react differently, but there must be an objective, pharmacological answer to these questions.**

I feel like so many people want answers to these questions but they are literally impossible to find without every second person throwing in their two cents on why you shouldn't mix such items, why the fella with the comment above is a fool, or why you should venture to another thread.

Everyone talks about the inhibition of P450 (codeine) or CYP2D6 (amphetamines and opiates) but conclusive answers are tough as nails to find. 

**We're not here to put Socks on Centipedes everyone, let's resolve this once and for all**

However, most people focus too much on the drug aspect rather than the actual problem. 

  Anyway, here's my story;

    So my fiancé of two and a half years got locked up exactly 2 months ago. When this happened, she was in my car, so it was impounded. I had no cash whatsoever, she was arrested with the last $50 I had. So, I had no cash for ANYTHING. I had hit rock bottom. So, I had no choice to move home.
    My dad helped me get my car out, so I could keep my job, which I'm beyond grateful for. So, she accepted her plea, which means she is getting out in 2 more days. Way fucking sooner than I'm prepared for. You can guess what I've been doing since she's been locked up. [insert needle emoji here]. Starting the day she is out, we have 30 days to get a permanent place so she can start her house arrest. We have been given the opportunity to stay in the small living area until we save enough to get out. It is not a place to permanently live. 
  Here is where my fear resides. So, a few weeks ago, an ex boyfriend of hers found out she was locked up, and he decided to visit her. The one ex she has, I get jealous over. Why? Because he is superior when it comes to being an adult. He makes a shit ton of money, he's a serious body builder, was/is a big shot in the army, has a badass house and a killer job. Naturally, I feel he has more to offer.
    She is in a position now, to where she will almost do anything to not go back to jail. She did not tell me she is going to go to him, but she did tell me that's an open door if I don't get my shit right. Her behavior as a genuine girlfriend hasn't changed. This guy came on his own, and has made several attempts to steal her from me in the course of our relationship.  And to be honest, I can't say I blame her if she took the opportunity. I have made plenty of mistakes during her stay, because I live a junkie lifestyle, which is at an end (9 days sober).
    Ugh....this shit is stressful. She is the only thing I have left that makes me happy and I feel like I've already fucked it up. I didn't expect her to be out so soon. I guess I'm just looking for an outsider's perspective on this. 

tl;dr Girlfriend got busted 2 months ago. Her successful ex surprise visited her and offered her a good job and place to stay. I have a temporary place for us to stay til we save the money in 30 days. Her behavior as a girlfriend/fiancé hasn't changed, but she will live with him before going back to jail. If we fail to get a place, I lose my gf to another man.

Fyi I am not dependant on any opiate.
I’m going to write my questions and then More detail will be given about myself and the situation (IMPORTANT so please read it, will be the last paragraph).

•does tramadol cause any euphoric effects at 50mg? 

•What doses would you say are good for someone who’s new to opiates as a whole

•how many days should I leave between each dose to avoid addiction?

•is tramadol a good choice with given situation? 

I am a 19 year old Male. Suffer from pretty bad anxiety issues and that creates paranoia, also have pretty bad depression, some days I sit and break down, some i don’t. 50/50 chance every day, that’s why I want to know how many days I should leave between each use.

I first took cocodamol 30/500 codeine/paracetamol (for anyone who doesn’t know) and they make me feel pretty good. Although it wasn’t recreational. It was for a tooth infection. Once the pain stopped I stopped using cocodamol because I was scared of becoming dependant on it. (Ikr over 60mg of codeine for about 4 days, once a day) this was around 5 days ago since I stopped. 

So for those who didn’t read what’s above I’m 19, Male, have pretty bad anxiety and depression that I struggle to deal with. It’s a day to day thing and I am on NO other medication. I do smoke weed quite often to help bring my anxiety down but doesn’t always work. And that’s why I’m looking into opiates. I’m becoming sick of the condition I’m in and I would kill just to feel normal again. And I’ve heard tramadol acts as an SRNI also. So this got me curious and I read about people feeling euphoria. Only one person said he’s on 200mg daily and he feels great and functional. I don’t wanna be in such a high dose but I just want the edge taken away. The feeling that something is gonna go wrong wherever I go. Feelings of people staring at me and overthinking what people think about me. Overthinking every single action I make and looking back on it after to point out the flaws. 

Tramadol Is my only hope right now. I don’t wanna delve too far into the world of opiates because I have a very addictive personality and I have lost family to opiates. I don’t want to become dependant just something as a last resort when I’m feeling this SHIT. 

Help, please. ",1526878227.0

It's a long post below, I just don't really have anyone to talk to about this part of my life. 

I've been wanting to get clean for a while, I moved out to California to escape my hometown back east and attempt to get clean. Being the junkie I am though, I sought out this devilish drug, which took me no time at all to find a relatively steady connect. Its been around 9 months now since I started using out here, and I'm just absolutely miserable.

I was working some shitty job, only 20 or so hours a week, for shitty pay. I took the job originally just to get out of the fucking house, and attempt to make some friends out here, but I just very recently fucked that up. Misses two shifts because I was sick as fuck, and just didn't return or make a phone call to them mostly out of embarrassment.

Fortunately, I came from a rather wealthy family, which is both a blessing and a curse. My father pays my rent out here, luckily he just got me my own studio apartment because he thinks I'm doing better than I have been in the last 5 years of my life. Because of my addiction we've never been to close with one another. His sister died early from addiction, and alcoholism played a part in my grandfathers death as well, so has a hard time dealing with all this. Since I've moved out west, we've actually been able to form a pretty strong relationship and I talk to him daily multiple times. The fact that it's more or less built on a lie of how well I'm doing here, is beginning to eat away at me. Causing me to get waves or extreme depression lately that'll just come and go.

I got high on heroin for the first time 9 years ago at the sweet age of 16. I can honestly say up until just a few months ago I never gave a fuck about what my actions were doing to my friends and family. I didn't give a shit about frivolously spending my fathers hard earned money well because, he's rich what the fuck does it matter, I was only concerned with having a good time or getting high.Now though, it truly eats away at me, that I can be such a fucking heartless piece of shit human being. I desperately want to get clean now, because lying and using my father like this now is absolutely taking a toll on me. I just sit in my apartment everyday by myself getting high, hating life.

Today though, I was lucky. My connect gave me three suboxone’s, two bars of Xanax, and around forty 600mg gabapentin for free, because she can see the pain in my eyes (her words), and knows what its like kicking dope. I actually deleted any number that I could use to get anything, and did a shot and threw my whole set up into the trash. I don’t think I’ve ever wanted to get clean so bad in my life before. I actually cannot stand the person I am today and it quite literally makes me sick to my stomach. 

Truthfully, I wish that I had the balls to just end my life today; just put a ton of extra dope into one shot, hit a vein and fade into nothingness. Never have to deal with disappointing the ones I love the most again, and not having to ever fall back down this miserable rabbit hole. As much as I want to though I just know I don’t have it in me to do so. Which realistically is a good thing, but I really cannot picture myself having a productive fulfilling future. One where I enjoy where I’m at, what I’m doing with my life, and one where heroin isn’t involved.

Tomorrow at this time exactly, I will take my first 8mg sub with half a bar and a ton of gabapentin. I don’t just actually want it this time, and desperately need to get clean. I see the homeless out here in California, and cannot help but think how that’s going to be me, if I make it another couple of years in this hellish life. 

Sorry for the long post. Sorry for jumping around a lot in my writing as well there’s just a lot on my mind currently. Thanks for reading for all those who did. This is why I enjoy our community here at r/opiates. You all understand the struggle, the pain, the highs and lows that come with such a lifestyle. Enjoy the rest of your day everyone, cheers mates.


Edit: Not that anyone will probably see this. But I made this post on Sunday, and took my last shot at around 530pm. Today is Tuesday at 8:42pm, and I haven't gotten high. These two days are the longest I have clean, off of just dope, in the last couple of months. Ate some gabapentin yesterday when I awoke, and held me until around 7pm. Haha I then took 2 bars of xanax, blacked out. Who knows if I slept. I awoke, earlier today to find I ordered uber eats 3 times, the last was at 7am. And on my night stand was an open suboxone, so I'm guessing I took one at some point throughout the night. But no heroin, and I'm very happy.",1526856150.0

I also bought Kratom, a brand called Kratom Kaps from a headshop.  I took 4 a few days ago and kinda scared me.  I know everyone says to order online and that headshop stuff sucks, but I’m not spending money on that.  Are these Kratom Kaps legit ?  Or do they have like bath salts in them.

I’m just trying to make it OFF.  I’m fully committed to doing therapy and meetings and everything.  I’ve been hating this habit for months.  I’m just worried about the next few days as I have to go to work and my boss is flying in from New York for meetings Wednesday .

Any advice? I’m in a bad spot and could use some kind words.  Thanks everyone :(",1526847047.0

(Involving fentanyl patches)","This may be one of those questions where I’m told to just google it, but I tried that and couldn’t find a clear answer. So I’m hoping y’all can shed some light. 

Question: how much total fentanyl (G’s? Mg’s?) are in a 75 mcg/ph patch? Meant to be worn for 3 days. Or where can I find a calculator to figure out the total dosage?

This is far from my first time chewing the patches, and i have a pretty decent tolerance. However, I usually cut them and chew it up in smaller pieces. Today is the first time I put the whole thing in my mouth. I’ve been chewing it, off and on, for a couple of hours now and I feel pretty damn good. I’m just wondering how much fentanyl I just put in my system.

Now let's go back to yesterday. I live in a bad place in the city and run trough the ""open market"" almost everyday to go to work, see some friends etc so i'm going trough my normal path when a nigga carrying a fucking gun (don't know a lot about guns but i THINK it was an ak-47, they are kinda famous around these areas) is running at my direction. I froze thinking ""this is it, there's some shooting going on and that's where i die"" but no he came running, handed me a package (while running and without saying shit) and just kept running, after 10s maybe a police car goes by full speed probably chasing that guy.


I stood there for 5min maybe thinking the guy or someone else would come back for the package but no one did so i go home. When i get home and open the package, it's like a brick on heroin. Don't know the name or number or anything like that but i've seen by photos and it was defnitely H. When i used i only got Tar so i could smoke but this shit was gray so maybe it was a better and more expensive type, don't know.


Afraid of getting smoked for stealing a whole package of dope (don't know how much it weight it either, i don't have a scale but i guess it was something around 20g or maybe 30g, i have no clue) i go to the open market at night and start talking to an old fellow i've bought before, i explained the shit to him and he got the package from me and told me to wait. He came back less than a minute then thanking me for this and saying the boss told him to get me 3g of the best dope they had. My mind is racing and the devil in my shoulders is screaming GET THAT SHIT YOU FUCKING BITCH GET THAT BITCH THIS RIGHT HERE IS THE BEST DEAL OF YOUR LIFE but i told the guy: ""No thanks, i'm clean of that shit"" and started walking, i hear the guy saying behind me ""fine man, do what you want"".

Today after going to the supermarket, some random guy came to me saying he heard of the package i gave them back and offered me some beer since he heard i wasn't using it anymore. I told thanks but i wasn't drinking either, my goal was to be 100% sober for as long as i could before i start drinking again (never had a problem with alcohol just doesn't want to change one addiction with another) so the guy gives me a lazy smile like ""nigga i give you 1 week to start getting high again"" but then he gave me 50 reais ( something around 15 dollars) and went back to his thing.

I have no idea what happened to the guy that was running, he probably didn't want to get caught with drugs and handed me the shit without thinking twice. Moral os the story is: 1 week clean and 15 dollars richer yaayyy

So, how will the process go when I take it with me to my appointment? Let it thaw a few hours and then use hot hands? How will I know it's body temp? Will it be body temp if I saran wrap it to my stomach/hip for an hour?

As stated above, they gave me a front on a gram. I told them I’d have the money tomorrow. Anyway, tomorrow rolls around. I leave work and don’t have time to cash my check. The girl who owes me money won’t be able to meet until later. I tell them I won’t be able to get the money together tonight, if I could just pay them tomorrow. I also told them that I MIGHT have $50 \(out of the $60 I owed\) if/when my homie comes through. Rachel says that tomorrow is fine. About an hour later, she says that they are doing business in the area and might try and come through for the money after my homie does. To make a long story shorter, homie can’t come through tonight with my money. I tell Rachel this, and she BLOWS UP my phone, basically accusing me of lying and giving them the run around in order to buy me some more time to get the money together. I tell her I will have her money in the morning \(which, remember, she had already agreed to before this anyway\).

I hit them up in the morning \(yesterday\) and we agree to meet so I can pay them and to also buy another gram. I tell them that I will find a ride \(about a half hour drive\) so they didn’t have to drive to me \(as they both have warrants\). I get to the meeting spot and she says that Adam is locked in the bathroom, “looking for a vein” trying to shoot up, that they will head over in a few. Probably 30 minutes roll by. Ok… She tells me to be patient, that they will be there. Another 30 minutes. What the fuck? Can I come to their motel room? What's going on? Another 30 goes by. She gets bitchy with me and tells me to be patient. I tell her I’m about to take off. She says “Ok, 15 minutes,” which come and go. Says she left her scale and had to go back. Another 15, then she says she left her phone and had to go back. At this point I know she is obviously lying to me. I leave to go score somewhere else.

A few hours later, the texts start coming in. She rips into me for not being patient \(I waited there for over two hours\). I tell her that it was obvious she was lying, which is ironic since she had reamed me out hard last night for supposedly lying to her and giving her the run around. I’m not just a fucking worthless junky whose time is less valuable than theirs. Fucking hypocrite… And, frankly, disrespectful. She goes off on me, and now Adam is hitting me up from another phone: “Disrespecting my girl, I’ll fuck you up bitch. Call me a liar, the last words you’ll say to me mutherfucker.” Yada, Yada, Yada. Something to that extent.

Now I’m getting it from all sides, and she tells me she wasn’t lying but that Adam had actually been up all night, locked in a bathroom, tweaking and trying to find a vein. She asks if we can drop the whole thing, and I agree. I’m at a concert, but will hit them up after to see if we can meet so I can pay them, although I’m not particularly looking forward to a meet\-up with a dude threatening me and running on huge amounts of speed and heroin and no sleep. I then text Adam the same thing, that he isn’t thinking right, and will call him after the show when he has calmed down a bit. He says, “Don’t even fucking call me.”

Holy christ, this got long… So, r/opiates, what should I do with this predicament? What am I gonna do in that situation, not defend myself? It would be a bummer to lose this connect, but I’m honestly trying to stay clean, so maybe it wouldn’t be such a bad thing? Obviously, I’m trying to avoid any heated, potentially violent confrontation with these people. It sounded like Rachel was willing to drop the whole situation as long as I paid, that she didn’t want to lose me as a customer. And maybe Adam was just spun\-out, acting crazy, doing asshole meth stuff? What would you do in my situation?",1526793056.0

I've just yesterday gotten the news that they will in fact hire me, which is fucking amazing! 


There's one teeny tiny issue though. They have made it abundantly clear that eventually, they will want to relocate me to their US dependency/office on account of this company being located in Hicksville Germany and me probably being the only one in the entire HQ to speak fluent English. Well this office of theirs across the pond happens to be in a major US city of all places and I'd be living in the burbs.


Now on the one hand, this is quite literally my dream come true. I've been pretty excited about the prospect of eventually returning to the US ever since my exchange year (when I was still a normoid) so for this to enter the realm of possibility... that's damn nice. BUT I'm clean (on Methadone at least). And I really really *really* love crack and Heroin. This doesn't bode well, if that major US metropolis with a reputation  of being  drug-infested is to be my next address. I have some European street smarts, but not sure how well they will work when copping in the US, especially since that new city seems wild as fuck.

I just want everyone to keep reminding themselves if you're clean for any amount of time, it's an accomplishment - period. Relapses happen to a huge percentage of people who are in these shoes and it certainly doesn't mean future attempts at becoming sober are worthless; focus on the fact that you can succeed at anything. 

If you're clean, you succeeded; both success and failure are transient and you never lose the opportunity to succeed.

The part that threw me off obviously was blood was drawn and like I said, it wasn’t burning when I started pushing down. This has never happened to me before. So I looked it up and I found out it might have been an artery. What do y’all think?

Whaddup scabies and gentlescum its ya boyo: the edgy, the itchy, the crispy emptymickeys! I know it's a lame introduction, but I notice when most people share their first posts, there's always that lil first day of elementary school vibe. Anyways, I love this sub, between being glued to this and /nosleep all I do is work, smoke too many cigarettes, boot dope, skateboard,and eat snickers ice cream. Ok, so now to the point of this post, biggest FML day I've had in a while. It happened February 11th, I know caus I still have my *hospital* bracelet.... decent foreshadowing.... as I've seen plenty on here, we all seem to share the (mis)fortune of having really shitty days. Well, I'm gonna tell you about my day, *Une petite* glimpse at my life at its worst, drenched in existential anguish and angst, vulnerability at its purest form. You get to watch life mock me ostentatiously. You get it, Right? It's was a shitty one.

I stared out over a canyon and watch the sun begin to rise; it had been my second night with no sleep. Which honestly sucked for me, cuz I love sleep. I'll take as may naps as I'm allowed. It was probably like my 10th time smoking crystal. Not a big fan of the methanphetamines; makes me quite, feels like I have 50 needles poking inside my gut, and I get hella bummed out and start rehashing old nightmares that I promised I was done stressing about. Anyways, i had been homeless since Jan 18, leaving me without a chance to shower. Summating to me looking like and being a dirty junkie. And if any of you guys have been tweaking for two days you start seeing things.... 
so anyways, I was attempting to cook up a shot of dope to calm me down when I felt something. It felt like bugs were crawling all over my skin which immediately made me flip out. I stopped what I was doing and started looking around, that's when I saw it. There were little bubbles/holes in everything! In the dope I was cooking, on my syringe, in the dirt, but worst of all: holes in my skin. Suffocating from anxiety, I nervously slammed my shot of dope (which looked carbonated), and immediately ran down to my friend Glitters tent at the bottom of the canyon. I was freaking out, yelling and saying that there was a disease spreading rapidly throughout the so-cal area! He scoffs me off as he goes back to sleep, so I make the great and LOGICAL decision to call my boss. It was 5am, so I left him a detailed message about the end of the world, and I can't show up to work later today blah blah blah. *SIDE NOTE* to this day, that message I left him- which he later recited to me when he fired me- was the most insane and embarrassing thing I have ever said. After I leave said detailed message for my 15 year sober boss, I call my dope dealer and warn him of what is about to happen. And that's exactly when the logic kicks in. He tells me to shut up, and asks me if I have been up smoking meth for two days. That's when it hit me. I was hallucinating. 
Regardless of my meth hallucinations, something seemed fucked up, I had holes in my skin for fucks sake! So, I continued on my journey to the nearest hospital. On my way there, I stopped to look at myself in a car side mirror. I looked terrible. Huge pupils, cuts and scrapes, dirt, and lastly, fucking holes in my face! All of a sudden, a sharp stinging emits from my temple, I see a bright light, and my ears start ringing so I take a few steps back. I guess the owner of the car saw me looking in his mirror, figured I was trying to steal from his car so he threw a thermos at my face. Stunned, I just ran away avoiding the confrontation, and went straight into the hospital to the ER.
 Long story short, a (female) doctor saw me and took my blood and asked me to strip so she could examine these holes in my skin. Now, because I had been homeless and hadn't showered for about a month, I had no idea what I looked like naked. Hadn't changed underwear, pants, sock, you name it. I was gross. Anyways, I was bashful to remove all my clothing, however, she assured me that she's seen much worse than whatever I was about to show her. Now her boost of confidence didn't help me much, but it was enough for me to get naked in front of her and two nurses. The moment she looked at me she winced, and her face turned from a smile to a disgusted face. I was covered - COVERED - in scabies. Worst of all was my Gentile area. It was terrible. Moving forward, she let me shower in the hospital and prescribed me a Litany of anti fungal and anti mite creams. In conclusion, not only did I actually end up having scabies, but I was freaking out and seeing meth bugs everywhere as well. Easily in my top 10 of worst days in my life.

Proud to say I am now 61 days clean, have a job, a place to live, and a car. My time spent in San Diego was a fucking nightmare and I hope to never go back. Just figured I'd write down one of the MANY bad memories I have of that city. Sorry if it's too long, but I didn't wanna skim through the story. Anyways lots of love. Peace!

PS: first half was written a week after the event, just found it on my notes, and figured I'd finish the story that my smacked out self couldn't. You know.

We are rolling out a new policy here at /r/opiates that **will** clear some of the clutter and riff raff out of the sub. As this subreddit has grown the dynamics of the content and userbase base has changed quite a bit and we have been getting a large influx of questions that are asked every single day, multiple times a week, and dozens upon dozens of posts have already answered these questions....so we are going to start removing them at moderator discretion. I am talking about the questions like 'how long do I have to wait to feel heroin after I just took Suboxone' and 'how do you plug/boof' or 'can I take 1500mg of tramadol and get high' type questions that have been answered very thoroughly in this subreddit and in easily accessible scholarly articles via Google.

This doesn't mean that we aren't answering questions anymore, and we definitely will not be removing anything harm reduction related, but you may be given the answer via the reddit search function and your post will be removed. We also understand that there are variables and unique approaches to some of the super common questions and they will mostly be left up.

If your post is removed for this reason you will most likely see this macro:

>Your post was removed due to the fact that it is easily answered by using [Google](https://www.google.com) or by [searching previous posts in this subreddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/search?q=&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all) If you feel that it was removed in error you can respond to this message with your reasoning or you can [message mod mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fopiates) and we will re-evaluate this decision.

Like the macro says, if you really cannot find the answer on Google or on here and you think it's a valid question, you can respond to that removal message or message modmail that is linked in the removal reason and we will take another look at the post.

This approach that we are now going to be taking is not something that is new or unique to /r/opiates, other long standing and well regarded forums such as bluelight and opioiphile have taken this approach for many years. We are not trying to turn this place into one of those places, but we want to see quality content that generates discussion and a sense of community among the users here, not 4 posts in a row that ask if they can get high off a 5mg Vicodin and a Benadryl where people just go in there and tell them to boof it and make fun of them.

This may not be the most popular policy to be put into place, but it is something that we have been talking about for a long time and have decided that it must be implemented if we want to continue to see quality content.

Thanks for reading and working through this with us y'all,

>The /r/opiates mod team.

8kle79,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8kle79/need_help_with_this_one/,10,https://redd.it/8kle79,throwawayopiateidiot,Need help with this one..,"Hi guys, I have a bit of a problem that I hope you can help me with. I'm using a throwaway for this one.

Background:

Last year I was a recreational user of Subutex at pretty low doses, at about 0.3\-0.8mg/day in the morning, for about 6 months before tapering down and using kratom before jumping off completely without any withdrawals. I was clean from opiates for a few months before starting taking kratom again, at about 4\-6g/day in the mornings before work.

After a couple of months, a couple of weeks ago, I got somewhat depressed and got curious to try out Oxycodone for a week to manage the stress at work I was experiencing, planning to use subs if I felt any withdrawal after that, and then do a rapid taper if I needed it.

I was planning to use this weekend to wait until the withdrawal kicked in before starting using the subs. I had read up on precipitated withdrawal and knew I needed about 24 hours after the last dose to avoid that. And this weekend would be great for that since I had nothing planned and, then again, I had only planned on using the Oxys for a week. Anyways, on to the problem..

Problem:

I didn't get my subs yesterday, and I know I'm an idiot for not making sure I had them before I even ordered the Oxys. 

And on top of that, I found out yesterday that the Oxys were fake. They came in blister packs, and since I'm a bit of a noob I got fooled big time.

It turns out that they contain Methoxyacetylfentanyl. And that explained why I felt the urge to redose so damn often. After using them a couple of days I felt I had to redose about every hour. 

I have been using a quarter of a pill \(one pill is supposed to be 80mg of oxy, but obviously not\) per day for about a week now, but I have no clue what the dosage is since they are fakes, which also sucks!..

I feel mild withdrawals in the morning about 6\-9 hours after the last dose. I can't wait more than 12 hours after the last dose because I need to seem normal for work, at least need to be able to be at my ""B\-game"". And next weekend we have a get\-togheter at work which is mandatory, and I don't have the option to call in sick right now unfortunalty.

Question:

So, I figure my option is to order either H or Oxy so I get a more predictable opiate that I don't need to redose so often, and make sure I get my subs next week.

Or can I jump on the subs before the 12h mark when I feel mild withdrawal \(runny nose/eyes and sweating\), or do I risk precipitated withdrawals doing that?

I need your expertese on this one!

Same day my IOP counselor calls my family and tells them ive been faking the drug tests. (Long story) Right when I have dope in my system and have a bunch left. I want to just stop or throw it out so i can try to get this shit out of my system. Im at IOP now and have to take another test and its gona be so sketchy. I'm so scared this is gona blow up and ill get caught. If i get caught I lose everything. Literally, EVERYTHING. EVERYTHING! I'm freaking out and so uncomfortable idk how im gona sit thru this group. I'm so stupid, why did i let the cravings take over?

This is so stupid, i should be able yo use IOP as a tool and speak openly to them, but instead i will be forced to come up with more lies. This is fucking stupid. I really feel like all the trouble that drugs bring has always been activated by my family. Everything will be good except ill use occasionally, then get caught. Then im kicked out, lose job. Then I'm homeless for awhile. Then its back to rehab so i can get out, get high, and get caught all over again.

They will all be crushed together into a powder. 

My plan was to dose volumetrically since it was all crushed to powder and the two meds aren't very different from each other, but how long can I store the liquid concoction and should I just use water, and how much per pill? I planned to use 1mL per mg, 2 max if that won't dissolve it. That's about a week's worth of doses for me. 

Also there will be apap so I was considering CWE but I've never done so on such a large scale. Usually I just use a coffee filter but I think I'd have to use a different set up and divide it into batches. Any tips? I don't want to lose too much of the opiates.

I’ve been reading and lurking for a while and just thought I’d introduce myself. I live up in the northeast. Been taking opiates for about 15 years or so. My journey started back when I got all 4 of my wisdom teeth pulled. They were all impacted and ended up getting dry socket. I remember getting Vicodin 7.5s and I was down to my last 3. So I took them and I felt like a million dollars!!! God I miss a low tolerance. 

I chipped for many years and gradually got more and more into it. Then I started having sever health issues and I fell down the stairs at home. Wasn’t even drunk or high at the time. Was going downstairs to get a drink and my knees gave out and fell. So after blood work and mri’s and everything, I was diagnosed with Lyme disease, degenerative disc, and 2 herniated discs. Unbearable. And I went years without a diagnoses for Lyme. Multiple doctors over the years couldn’t figure out what was wrong and flat out told me there was nothing wrong with me and I was too young to have the problems I was having. They said it was all in my head until my new doctor properly diagnosed me. I got the treatment for it, but since I went so long without being treated, the damage has been done. That’s a story for another time. But I wouldn’t wish Lyme on anybody. 

Anyway, just wanted to say hi and share a little about myself. 

Happy nods everybody!!!",1526723753.0

I love opiates but hardly use them because of the price. Please tell me if my idea will work,"So my psychiatrist is a pill pusher who doesn't gave a shit. I have more controlled meds than non controlled ones. Here is my current benzo regimen that is prescribed is 4 mg alprazolam, 40 mg of diazepam, 1 mg of clonazepam all daily. In addition, if I see him before a refill is due he will switch the benzzo so i refill my current script of let's say alpraz, and I ask for temaz he will give me that so I will have a alpraz refills and a fresh temazepam. In addition to the benzos he gives me desoxyn \(methamphetamine pills which I am currently on so please pardon the rambling, he gave me 115 mg of amphetamine a day at one point\) 16 mg of bunephorine \(I was curios about it and he said it can help with depression so he wrote me a script. Then there is the pregabalin, gabapentin, modafanil, and then some other non controlled pills like mirtazapine.

my benzos dose varies. Some nights I just need 30 mg of diaz or 2 mg of alpraz, but there a days where I can take 20 mg of a combo of alpraz diaz and clonaz. I sound coherent and I can function fine not blackout and remember everything i did. 2 mg of xan could cause blackouts in some people, and im here all fine and dandy taking 20 mg of xanax. And I dont have to worry about running out of pills.

So as I said, I am kind of being forced to go, but at the same time i need detox. Now the suboxone i dont get often because my insurance wont cover it. I buy strips every once in a while 2 for 25 bucks but it doesnt get me high like i used to. I could buy a blue for that price but i have no connects. Benzo withdrawal is hell and i feel like methadone would give me some pleasure and help the withdrawal and buy the time I'm out there wouldnt have been enough time to become dependent on it.

OK I have rambled way to long. Here is my idea. Get any dose of oxy, even 5 mg would work. They will piss test me and I will show up positive. I tell them I've been taking 90\-120 mg of oxy a day, and i tell them ive been on subs before and they gave me a horrible reaction but I have done methqdone for both macitence and detox and it works so much better. I know methadone is dangerous especially at high doses but i will be in a medical facility they can just narcan my ass. I  doubt they have the resources to check the actual levels of opiates in my piss but please correct me if I am wrong. I would appreciate you opinion and fact if you know somehow.

tl;dr Need to detox from high dose of benzos. I have no opiate tolerance but i will buy one oxy so they give me methadone so the benzo withdrawal sucks.  ",1526715387.0

After a 17 year hiatus, I am back to shooting BTH. 😎 (Cue evil dun dun dun).  Yep, I know. Lots of feelings about it. So a brief recap of my life as why I am at this point of my life; I originally started when I was 17, and was clean by 18. Barely a year of it shooting BTH. I did AA and stayed clean until approximately three years ago when I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia, CFS (chronic fatigue syndrome), anxiety, and depression. 😌 The pain in my body was/is so bad I started on Tramadol within 3 weeks of being gifted this wonderful disease/condition/illness/whatever the F*** it is! 😤 After a year or so of Tramadol I slowly started Norcos as the tramadol was no longer cutting it, so forth and so on until we get to today. I think I've been using BTH for about a month now, and have been shooting for about 1-2 weeks. When I did it when I was 17, my then BF did all the dirty work for me, I mean everything. Therefore today I feel truly like a very very newbie junkie. My arms look like pin cushions, with bruises everywhere. I've even went so far as to look up on YouTube how to shoot. 😂 Ive gotten tons better at it but am left with awful looking arms I can't and won't show anybody. Anyone else relate? I am beyond grateful to have a place like this to vent. This did not exist 17 years ago, that's for sure! Lol.

I've also been mostly snorting it because... let's just say needles haven't been my friend lately.

Got into a three day bender with the other stuff, ran out of it, then needed to come down so I've just been nursing this powder. Slept great two nights ago, slept pretty well the next night, then today I've just been sort of floating through the day. But I'm running out of this powder.

I'm pretty good at tapering on my own, but here's where the stupid starts (okay I admit that's a debatable statement):  for ""dinner"" I ate a bunch of Red Vines and Sour Patch Kids. I also took some amitriptyline (sp) which I used to take for sleep but I don't like it much so I haven't taken it in a while, but I took some tonight because I started to feel very weird and wasn't sure if I could get to sleep.

Now I'm feeling REALLY weird and also really queasy, and not tired at all. I can't tell if it's because I'm coming off this stuff or if its because of my nasty ""dinner.""

However, he is constantly broke and asking for money from my father or from me. I have given him about $5k over the last year in random amounts and I’m betting my father has given even more. My mother has basically disowned him bc he stole a ton of jewelry and electronics when living with my parents a year or two ago before they kicked him out which is why he now lives alone. Recently, he called me begging for help and I gave him $700 but then found out two days later he took an additional $300 from me. This is in addition to begging and being given money from my father a few days later as well. I never told my father before that I also gave him money but with him stealing and my father complaining about him needing money again, I figured we should be more united and im done protecting my brother. 

All my brother has at this point is my father and I. I don’t want to just disown him bc he’s gonna end up in jail, dead, or homeless and he is family. He has been on and off subs at times and has been to group therapy and individual therapy basically bc he’s been forced to go by my father. Thankfully he has never been arrested. He says none of the standard treatments work for him so he quits pretty quickly and as a 30+ year old, I can’t make him do anything he doesn’t want to though I have tried. In general, he doesn’t seem to want to quit and the only motivation to stop for him is the financial cost as he can’t earn enough to support his habit. 

I have done my share of drugs including roxi so I get how awesome it is but it’s hard for me to understand his willingness to steal from family over and over again. I feel that he can make whatever life choices he wants but there is no reason he can’t be self sufficient at the very minimum.  He can still have a quality, fulfilling and happy life if he quits as he has a well paying office job and no record but that opportunity won’t last forever and it’s obvious he has no desire to quit. 

How should I proceed at this point? Any advice from others who have been in similar situation would really help plus there is a chance my brother sees this and maybe the thoughs of others affect him in a way my words seemingly have not. ",1526709531.0

I was working the shit out of my 12 step program. Praying every night. I was riding high on a pink cloud and for the first time in my life I was genuinely happy. 

Then out of no where and for no discernable reason the cloud disappeared and I fell into a deep depression l. This time it was worse than it's ever been. I was a cunt to my sober living house manager for a few day and so..last night I got home from a meeting and all of my shit was on the porch in the pouring rain. My computer for work. All of my books and artwork. Ruined. They told me it was time to go. They said I was on my way to a relapse and they could t allow the negativity in the house. I didnt understand where it came from. I felt like I'd just been blown up with a fucking grenade. 

My sover living house mates where all crying and begging them to let me stay. I dont believe they asked the program to kick me out. I'd been so close to all of them.

How could this have happened? The one time I stay. The one time I give it my all. Out of the 30 or so rehabs I'd been to, this time I was going to do it. 

Tonight I gave up and turned into what the program managers knew I was all along. A hopeless fucking junkie. 

I did a speedball tonight and I didnt even like it but I'm going to keep doing them until I dont care anymore. 

Sorry for the rambling, depressing wall of text. I just know that of anyone would understand howI feel it would be you guys.

Homeless and shooting speedballs in a rat infested basement at my dealers.  Welcome back to hell.

**edit:**I just did a massive speed ball and it got scary for a sec but now the nod has me right where I wanted to be. Numb. That warm blanket that makes everything better for a few hours. Right now nothing matters.

**edit 2:** tonight wasn't it. I kept doing more, got in the hole with my dboy so I *had* to come back today to pay what I owe. So of course I bought a 20 of girl. Then was talked into doing my shot there..then decided I needed a 20 for the road. This happens every time.

**edit 3**: I'm back in it. All the way in. I just had an orgasm from a speedball. Fuck. This shit is the devil but it makes you feel like you're being touched by God. I dont want this anymore but I just cant seem to find a way for it to release me. I've done the steps, I've prayed for the obsession to lift. The big book talkes about the unfortunates. The damned. That are constitutionally incapable of being honest with themselves.""They're such unfortunates,"" it says. Am I one of them? Is this how I'm meant to live and die? I need a purpose but I cant find one. I'm lost and scared and fucking sad and it's so easy to just stick a needle in my arm and make it all fade away. I'm not incapable of being honest..I'm just a lazy coward. I take the easy way out every time. If this kills me I'll die a coward too.

If I don’t have them my anxiety is through the roof and I freak out almost like a panic attack knowing the sickness will be coming I can deal with most of it except the skin crawling feeling. That’s my biggest fear. I can’t let my family know what I’m doing or things will be bad so I lost my house, wife, etc over the last couple months and it’s all resorting back to these pills. I got to the point the other day where I actually wished I would just die in my sleep because I can’t keep going on like this anymore. I know I need to stop but I don’t know how to do it without freaking out. Any help would be great I absolutely can’t let my family find out so rehab is out of the question. I quit last time due to a distribution charge and had a 5 year vacation. Thanks to the amount of stuff I sold. Now I’ve been home almost a year got married for 10 months ran through 50’grand in cash i had put away and have nothing to show for it. I’ve spent about ten grand in 3 months on these damn pills and don’t know what to do. Please anyone that can help me message me. I don’t know what to do!! Thank you for any help",1526700222.0

After I thought I couldn't bare it anymore and I was in the clear I popped a 4 MG sub and totally felt worse. It was about 15 hours since my last dose. Maybe too soon? In the past a sub helped a lot.

I didn’t wanna overdo it (especially since opi+benzo=possible OD) so I started small, with 2/3 of a hulk bar (1.33mg) and 150mg Tram.

It deadass took ten minutes for me to feel it, and it was a unique feeling. It wasn’t insane or extremely sedating. But it left me absolutely spaced out and consumed in my thoughts about life and “shower thoughts”. Kinda like weed, but not sedated.

Then, it got me super fucking horny for some reason... just leave it at that lmao

But it was all over in an hour. Felt sober almost exactly 1 hour after, so that really caught me off guard. But honestly it seemed really good. The simplicity of the experience was something I didn’t expect to be so relaxing.

I did this at home, but it seems like something that’d work well in a social setting, to be more social and outgoing.

EDIT: After making the post, about ten minutes passed and then I started feeling it again, but more sedated and slightly euphoric from the tram. Ended up passing out on the couch after walking in. Like it kinda felt relaxing, then stopped, then hit like a truck and knocked me tf out.

That was a pretty nice combo, definitely doing it again",1526695449.0

I thought he was kidding but he proceeded to follow me around like a puppy and comfort me whenever I freaked out and said he wanted to have a movie date and all this shit. Literally freaked me out, I was the youngest girl there  so I just thought it was creepy. 

There was a few couples there against rules. When one left she picked up the other when he AMAed. Another got fucked in the laundry room where there was no cameras. The saddest part was when this patient  and walked off and went missing because his wife called the rehab to tell him they’re getting a divorce. I thought he was gonna end up dead but he came back a week later to get his stuff so at least he’s alive.

When I walked off to make a phone call, a man tried to pick me up off the side of the road and said he’d drive me whenever I wanted. I declined, and when I returned to the rehab I was informed that the city I was in was known for sex trafficking. 

Anyways, I left after detox 12 days in. The Uber driver was shocked to have pulled up to a rehab and the ride to the airport was awkward as fuck. Lmaoo.

I suffer from chronic pain issues and have been on different Opiates for nearly 15 years now, started off with Vicodin and Norco  (then I found a doctor who didnt know wtf she was doing and casued me to OD on a Fent patch)  eventually after a lot of trial and error and surgeries I've been on a steady dose of methadone taken as a regiment rather then as needed.  It has given me some semblance of a normal life.

This past year or maybe closer to 2 years though I notice my libido  vanishing and I have like 0 energy to do anything....my pain is under control but even for being on opiates my energy levels were no where and even watching a Janice Grffith performance didnt even cause a twitch down there.  One blood test later find out my testosterone is basically none existent.

Since I can't lower my dose and I've tried everything else for pain coming off the pain meds isnt an option so my doctor wrote me a script for testosterone and starting today when i pick it up I'm going to have to start giving myself a shot of it daily I think not sure on how often i have to dose pretty sure its daily tho.  So sorry to make a long post but I am just curious have any of you ever gone through this or known someone who has?  I know all the bad side effects that come from taking testosterone but am I going to expect those or maybe not since I'm not going over my natual levels just trying to get back to them?   3:30 am and I cant sleep so of course my brain is freaking out with racing thoughts about all the bad shit that can happen....any advice or thoughts or accounts of personal experience are welcome.",1526640084.0

A little back story, I've been playing around with pretty much anything I could get my hands on since I was 15 and im 26 now. Ive done copious amounts of pretty much everything except H.
 
Anyways, I've been hooked on subs for over 3 years now. It started as something that took the edge off and amplified alcohol and Molly. To something I feel like death without.
I stumbled upon this sub a few years ago, and it started as something I would get on while sick basically to know that somewhere else someone is going through something similar or much worse. Im glad I found this because I know now that no matter how sick I am copping H isnt the answer. That might sound dumb but I think this sub saved me from going down that path, because while sick anything to relieve the torment sounds good. I have been too chicken shit to post anything in fear that I wouldnt be accepted but after seeing how accepting everyone is its nice to know I have like minded people I can talk to.

Intros aside, Im roughly at about 4 mg a day and out of nowhere have had to go 7 days without because my connect fell off the grid. And today is definitely the worst of it, I tried going home early but got fucked over and had to finish out my shift. And my job is extremely physically demanding. I happened to check my phone and holy shit JJ is real my connect hit me up and told me Im all set when I get off. Im not religious at all but saw a few post where he came through and I figured I might've miss placed one but had no luck this morning. But reading that text gave me such relief that it felt like cold water was poured over my brain and I felt human for a little bit. Just curious has anyone else had a similar feeling when out and finally get the good news? 

Sorry if this post is a little scatter brained but Im still at work and sick. Hopefully for those in need JJ pulls through, for those getting clean hopefully it sticks, and for those who have it safe noddz. :)",1526596880.0

I’ve been using fentanyl and the withdrawal symptoms are pretty violent so I’m worried that once I take the suboxone it won’t shut down the withdrawal symptoms. I think I understand the precipitated withdrawal so I know I need to be full on in withdrawal to switch to it but then the big fear I have is that it won’t work. Once I have dosed suboxone and it has had some time to work and it hasn’t, would it not then be safe to dose fentanyl if I need to?  It seems to me that there can’t be any fentanyl present to start taking suboxone but then once I have it should be relatively safe to dose fentanyl and if the suboxone is doing what it is supposed to then the fentanyl just simply won’t have any effect? It’s kind of confusing. I have no experience with it at all but from the reading I have been doing it seems like it might be just what I need? Once I am stable on suboxone I plan to taper off and get on with my life.

Any insight appreciated. Thanks.

aye, throwaway account here. tried 10mg of oxy first time 2 days ago -- didn't feel shit, was my very first opioid experience.

tried 20mg the next day, felt a lil warm especially from my ears and slightly more positive about life, and upbeat, but still no nod or euphoria. and yes, i know the effects can be subtle, but it's disappointing to have to focus to feel anything on 20mg, whereas some people would puke their guts out on that dose.

anyone think 30mg as a next dose could be safe/not a waste? 40, perhaps?

keep in mind i'm a 5'3 54kg girl, not tryna die

i've also tried kratom before. many times. doses ranging from 1g to 6g and never felt a thing. haven't touched it in months.

Just wanted to say this sub is great and I think I am finally in the right mind set to kick it. Today seemed abnormal, no urge to pick up or pawn any thing. I am trying to recover from spending about $6,000-$7,000 in the past 2 and a half months. Just thinking about it grinds my gears.

If you anyone wants anyone to talk to, message me as this is gonna be 4th or 5th time I have gone through this. I get through a year or a year and half clean sometimes and just something happens in the journey that I take the wrong turn. I am commited though this time as I don't want to be homeless.

If anyone is homeless here, which I saw a few posts I commend you and wish I could house all of you. No one should be on the streets as the housing and food is abundant in this world. I wish everyone the best and hopefully I make enough money to take care of people who are lost in this world as I am. I am not going to talk all high and mighty about 2 days but it is a big step to me. The beginning of day 1 I had taken a sub at 2 AM that day which help me get past the withdrawals. I don't expect to feel any bad symptoms anymore hopefully, more mental is what I am thinking.

If you do the Suboxone route, try to do it just to detox and don't do long term. That is my advice but I know sometimes people have to do long term to make it out alive. Just know that I have done the quick suboxone detox and it does work. Get past the withdrawls and every day becomes easier. Each day you get stronger, mentally and physically. Don't ever give up boys and gals, you can do it. I have faith in you all. If you want it bad enough, hold on to it for dear life.

I could have a new car or went on a nice vacation. I was planning a trip, planning buying a new car, planning a promotion in my job. Everything went to shit, I suppose some people can handle opiates but I don't think I can. Once I get that sweet taste it is downhill from there.

I eventually get to the point I get sick of having to hustle, texting my plug, waiting for him to wake up as I lay in sweat drenched bed sheets. Not being able to work or even interact with anyone till I get my fix. Shit gets old but part of me wishes that I could carry on but at last it is just not feasible.  At least not at my current state. 

I am sure you guys are sick of my rambling so I will stop here. Thanks for anyone who read this, and God Speed my friends.",1526569129.0

I’m not a thug by any means but nothing I hate more than a wannabe.

We're ""living"" in agony; barely able to make it from couch to bed to bathroom, thanks to our broken bodies.

The ""drug"" war on people shows no sign of easing up -- as a result, many pain patients are turning to street drugs, buying everything from pills (preferable) to injectibles (that's how desperate we're getting). Speaking only for myself, the pain is so damn grinding there are moments when I don't honestly care about getting an overdose of fentanyl.

I understand that I'm drug *dependent* and accepted that when I was first prescribed methadone for pain. But drug *addiction* scares me. I'd like to hear from people who have experienced addiction firsthand: What is the difference between taking opiates to keep physical pain at bay, and taking them for physical pleasure? At what point did the drugs start using you? What are warning signs to look for in your own body?

I've given up on the hand-wringers who insist ""only your doctor"" should prescribe opiates; we're losing our prescriptions because our doctors are justifiably terrified of DEA prosecution and losing their licenses to practice. Thugs with guns are making our medical decisions by saying whether we should get opiates or not -- and it's mostly ""not!"" 

Is it possible to obtain pharmaceutical-grade opioids on the black market? What is the quality of black market drugs in general? Please don't bother telling us not to even consider illegal drugs -- many of us are seriously considering suicide, so warnings about a lesser issue are meaningless.

We know what we have to do; now, we want to do it as safely as possible.",1526565306.0

He's cool on my script (15 75 mc fent patches and 180 Roxy 20s) but he won't budge on early fills and yadda. Well, today I am going for an appointment early. My appoint isn't supposed to be til the 21st but I'm going today cuz I'm on my last patch and pill. They're switching my patches from generic 75 mc fent patches to name brand duragesic patches. So I'm going because I am HOPING the pharmacy will go ahead and fill them the 4 days early. I guess my questions are:

*Do you think my pharmacy/insurance will fill the patches 4 days early since I'm going from generic to brand? My insurance already approved because the generic suck since I can't get gel any more. If they'll fill early then I'll just walk out of there like it's all good. 

*If I ask my doc for an early fill I know he will say no; should I beg for something oral to take for the next 4 days in case my insurance or pharmacy don't fill? I am worried about this because I don't wanna draw attention to the early fill cuz usually my doc is like ""whenever the pharmacy says they'll fill it is good, I'm not going to ask either way."" So I don't wanna bring it to her attention and get a ""do not fill"" put on there. 

*Should I ask if I can have my 180 Roxy 20s changed to Roxy 15s or 10s? My thought behind that is maybe the pharmacy will fill early then since it's a MG change?

It lasted 90 days, just short of 100 before I had a pancreatic flare and ended up hospitalized again. They administered pain medication and my doctor put me back on a regular script. Then, my damned doctor decided he was getting out of the pain management business so 2 weeks after being put back on a steady script I had to find a new doctor. That was a pain in the ass and made me so mad that I was even back on these medications.

Since then, I've fallen quite hard back into old addiction-like habits and just wish I could manage my life without narcotics. I really don't see myself on these things forever and having an addiction is SO EXPENSIVE. 

So, here's my thought - I need to get clean. I just do. 

Except I'm so nervous for what withdrawals will do to me yet again. It's such a hard process to go through and can be a bit expensive if you use a medical detox facility. 

I'm thinking of cutting costs by seeing my hematologist/cancer specialist. I don't have cancer, he sees me for anemia issues, but his office offers IV hydration and any medication you might need from IV pain meds to chemotherapy. Each visit costs me $150 though, but seeing him 5 times from Monday - Friday is a lot cheaper than going to a medical detox facility.

I already have clonidine at home from last time, and all I would need is a script for something like Valium and possibly a muscle relaxant.

I don't know. I'm just typing out thoughts. Can anyone else add in anything that might be useful. I just want to be 100% sure about this because I don't exactly want to fail AGAIN.",1526556260.0

Meanwhile, the Subutex was working it's magic, knocking away the heroin molecules from her mu\-opioid receptors and throwing her into immediate, and severe, withdrawals.  She had lied and said she was sick and hadn't used for almost 12 hours.  She was high as fuck and was just a junkie wanting to boost her high, not aware of the mechanics of how to take Subutex.

She immediately, and simultaneously begins crying and shits on my dick.  A huge, fluffy marshmellow turd passes out of her asshole with ease and onto my cock.  I got about half a roll of paper towels and dumped a bunch of bleach on my dick, cleaned off, and dipped out.  Third strike you're out, bitch.",1526527416.0

Harder to cope with than when when my dog died in my arms at 6 years old.  More frightening and scarring then my dad drunkenly stating to my 8 year old self, “close that door now or I'll fucking kill you,” when I opened his bedroom door looking for him to help me one Saturday afternoon.  More physically damaging and draining than when I pissed off my football coach in 6th grade and he made me run 2 laps, then immediately play “push the line” with the largest guy on our team.  I would rather experience all those things daily for the next year than go through what I am right now.   

I started doing heroin roughly 7 months ago and have only ever injected it.  After the first month, I began adding cocaine to the shots for the crazy rush and euphoria it adds.  And just over this last month I tried it a few times with meth rather than cocaine, which gives it a much different rush and lots of talkative energy.  Over the course of 5 days with maybe 4 combined hours of very scattered naps throughout, I decided to try all 3 at once and in large amounts.  Over the first 3 days I go through 1\-2 grams of cocaine and heroin each day, then added the meth to the mix on the 3th day when a friend brought it over.  We went gambling around around 10pm and left a few hundred dollars poorer around 8am. It was right around here I realized the strange sounds I had been hearing throughout the night were actually whispers coming from my phone, it was just drowned out by the noise in the casino.  I tried calling my wife a few times, but didn't talk to her until afternoon.  During that time the whispers became somewhat clearer and I could even make out words and voices sometimes.  The voices also began coming from different areas of the room I was renting.  Sometimes the air vent, often where I had my laptop set up, and from near the toilet in the bathroom.  I searched the areas for signs of electronics and couldn't find anything, but things kept changing places and I swear I just saw the door close.  Is it possible someone has been fucking with me?  It was around 2pm or so on day 4 now and I finally spoke with my wife.  I casually mentioned what was going on and that I was a bit unsettled.  She said I was probably over stressed and too tired.  She doesn't like to talk much so our conversation was brief.  By now, if I was quiet enough, I could hear full phrases.  I would hear something like my brother in law whisper, “just look at that loser.  He throws out money he knows he doesn't have and still thinks he's cool?”  Or one of our old friends say, “Are you sure today is the best day?  Shouldn't we get more evidence and shit?”  I'm pretty fucking freaked out so I take another shot to calm down.  Didn't I have more than this?  Who has been fucking with my shit?  “Did you see that pathetic text he sent to Kate?  'I wish I could hug you' hahah.”  “Check this out!  He was just watching some vids he made with her and was jacking off!”  “WHO'S THERE?  I CAN HERE YOU!  WHERE ARE YOU!”  Kate wispers, “Hey, be quiet!  He heard us.”  I am scared shitless now.  I know this isn't right.  Kate is 100 mikes away and can't leave the city.  I'm fucking losing it.  I can't actually be insane though can I?  I'll call my wife.

After the 3rd dial and 2nd text, “Hey Kate?  I'm not trying to make things difficult for you or anything.  I know you have it rough right now too, but I'm pretty freaked out.  Will you talk for a bit?”  “Greg, you know it's late.  I'm tired.  Did you get any sleep?  Or did you see a doctor like we have talked about?”  ""I tried to sleep but couldn't.  And each PCP I am given either doesn't exist or can't take on new patients, the same as when we tried together.  I'll keep trying though.  Hey, you're not back in the city by some chance are you?  I'm not trying to be rude or anything I just\-” “What is it with you?  You freak out cause I don't answer immediately, now I'm skipping town?  To do what?  What do you think Greg?  Jesus, I've had enough, I'm going to bed.” Fuck...  I knew it would upset her but damn, couldn't she at least be civil when she answers a simple question?  Wait...  Did she even answer..?  

“He's so stupid.  I can't believe we actually stayed married this long.  Hurry this shit up.  Do we have everything we need?”  “KATE?!?  I THOUGHT YOU WERE OUT OF TOWN?  I CAN HEAR YOU, WTF IS GOING ON?”  “Just chill man, we have a chat going on and linked you in.  Look at the laptop!”  “ITS CLOSED!  WTF?!?”  “We can make the chat go through anything with speakers.  We've been recording you this whole time so your divorce will be fucking brutal!”  “I need this divorce to be over!  I can't wait to make it so you never see the kids, have to pay me every month, and I get that nice little SUV you're so happy with!  This is fucking great!  Keep shooting that shit in your arm!  HAHAHA”  “THIS IS FUCKED UP!  NO WAY IN HELL.  YOU'RE JUST FUCKING AROUND, RIGHT?  RIGHT?”  Call Kate's phone...  It's 6am, no answer.  She may still be asleep.  This isn't real, it can't be...  

“Hey sis, was he always this ugly?  I mean, ,if I were him I would have killed myself a long time ago!”  “I swear he was hotter before.  He had some muscle, more hair, and he actually had presence when around.  Now, haha, just look at him.  Nothing!”  “FUCK OFF”  “No, you fuck off.  We're coming there with the police right now to take you to fucking jail.  Hope you find a daddy there real quick!”  “FUCK THAT... I'LL JUST END IT NOW.  ILL SHOOT THIS WHOLE FUCKING GRAM AND BE DONE WITH ALL THIS SHIT!  I'LL PUT EVERYTHING I HAVE IN 1 FUCKING SHOT AND DONE!”  “Fucking do it already you little bitch!”  “He won't do it, hahaha.”  Everything is finally dissolved and I've just about filled the rig when I hear father in law whisper, extra quietly from outside the door, “You get that?  Now we can easily prove he's trying to kill himself too.  That will add more time once we revive him.  Attempted suicide, what an idiot.”  Oh fuck, they're here!  “Grandma, why is dad acting that way?  Whats wrong with him, will he be okay?”  “Oh honey, don't look right now, he's just feeling a little sick.  You may not see him much anymore.  He loved you though, I promise he did!” “But Grandma, we're almost there, can't we just go see him real fast?”   “No Baby Bear, we're too far away.  I'm sorry...”  What the fuck....  My kids are near by?  This is so fucked up, who would do that to their kids?  To their family?  I can't shoot this...  I need to find them.  There, that car looks like my mother in law's.  They've gotta be here!  I'll call the cops and explain everything!  I'll tell them about the speakers and computer, then they will have to arrest them and help me.  I need fucking help!  I don't want to fucking die!  I love my kids!       

So I called 911, cops arrived in about 10 minutes as I tried to explain everything over the phone.  I was handcuffed and questioned about everything in the middle of a hotel lawn as I cried and half the tenants watched.  I was taken to the hospital, given a few drugs and allowed to sleep, then spoke with  few psychiatrists and put in the back with 6 other people in small beds until morning.  I'm out now with a few phone numbers and doctor's names on paper and a band aid over my arm where the IV drip had been, about 2 inches from one of my favorite spots...  And apparently I threw out all my shit as I called the cops except enough on the baggie to make 1 small hit.  Guess it's time to call my d\-boy.

This is a true story...  I changes some details and left out some things that don't really matter.  But this happened.  To me.  Stay safe everyone.",1526525064.0

Well recently i've decided to start lowering my dose and eventually getting off of it.  I knew this would be coming soon so i've been careful to keep the doses low and not increase them. For a while i was actually getting a buzz from the sub (probably since it was a low enough dose to wear off before my next one). 

Anyways, I am now trying to dose less frequently and use smaller doses, but its harder than i thought it would be. i've tried all kinds of different strategies like taking 4mg every other day or taking 1.5mg a day.. but it seems like im getting to a point where i can't take any less than i normally do without getting WD symptoms in between doses.  Which sucks because i am currently trying to start a business and i feel really bad about being so dependent on something that doesnt get me high anymore and takes a lot of my time and money.

Does anyone have any advice? I hate the moody, mean, sweaty, achey person i become when my dose starts to wear off and i'm not even sure if ill be able to avoid that. Does anyone have any experience with low doses of sub? how bad are the cold turkey WDs?",1526512515.0

I finally got my ass into therapy for PTSD and depression and was prescribed Prozac (actually, the generic but whatever.) I was open with the doctor about drug use, what’s the point of all this if I’m going to lie, right? I asked about there being side effects of mixing it with dope or subs and she had to look it up to double check, but said the only thing was a very low risk of seratonin syndrome. 

I’ve heard of SSRIs killing a dope high, but while researching it also came across a few people claiming it potentiated it. Most said it made no difference. I couldn’t really care less about it boosting a high, but if I’m being realistic I’m not sure I’d take it faithfully if it made it so I can’t get off. I’m also worried about wreaking further havoc on my brain chemistry, but if it helped me through this low I’m open to it. 

Anyone have personal experience with this? I’m a daily user, trying to get back on subs but you know how that goes sometimes... I’m in a bout of fairly severe depression, which is something I’ve dealt with all my life even before drugs were in the picture. Any insight is appreciated.

I Just got out of my first time in rehab... And here's how I'm doing now.. Could use support.,"So I was off the wagon. I didn't use for a super long time. I was using opiates all together for about a year and shooting up for half that time, but I still couldn't quit the dope on my own.. I was waking up sick as fucking hell and I was also stealing from my family, wanting to quit that whole time but realizing I was still buying at least half a gram a day. 

While I was in rehab I hated it, I wanted to leave the whole time. Basically felt like I was in Christian school for a month. I was excited to go home. Then as soon as I get back I find out my mom and step dad are getting divorced after being together basically my whole life, I'm 22 BTW. They've been married like over 15 years not exactly sure the number. But anyways since I heard that I immediately, the day after getting out of rehab started shooting dope again for almost two weeks now.... I hate that I moved back to it so quickly. I have only been doing it like 3 days then stop for a few days then repeat so I don't risk dope sick too much.

I just wish I could stop this drug like I have with Adderall, Xanax, Crack, Molly all of which I haven't touched in months to over two years. But the dope is just different. If my mom finds out I'm using again. I'm probably going to be out on the streets. Just looking for support from this sub. I always loved you guys and gals in this sub. I'm just a mess lately..

Personally, one of my favorite things about being around here is answering some of the questions. Generally speaking, I am pretty well-versed when it comes to opiate use and abuse. Been at it for nearly a decade, as both a pain patient and an addict. I come here for harm reduction, to answer some of the questions that have been answered a thousand times or that people I come here for harm reduction, to answer some of the questions that have been answered a thousand times or that people mock. I come here because over the two years I've been here, many names are familiar and I like to keep up with people. I come here because I have formed friendships with many of you, and because you guys understand me. I come here because no matter whether someone is wanting to share about banging their fire dope or talking about wanting to quit... Everyone here is supportive of what other people are here for. I come here to share my experiences. I come here because so many of you are rooting for my recovery and the support means a lot.

I usually get Sandoz Prefibin brand bupe but yesterday I filled and got sun pharmaceuticals Netherlands  bupenorphine HCL and the pills are white and have an 8 on one side and nothing on the other
They are also chalky and when taking the pill from the blister pack there’s powdery bits around and behind it which seems like a weird unprofessional thing to me as none of my others were messy like this.
There is also NO taste which I have never experienced ever. Usually even suboxone has a bitter taste. There’s nothing here. 

They burn like hell when dissolving and I don’t feel anything but cravings which I usually take my dose and have no issues all day. 
Really concerned because I live in England and local pharmacies have been busted dispensing fake stuff from India and etc recently in a crack down and it has me worried that it may be the case with these.
Weird that when I look them up they all have numbers on the back from sun pharm but mine do not. 

I plan on talking to the pharmacist next week and asking him to order the others for next time because it hurts me really bad as these dissolve. Just wondering if anyone else has any experience with these? 

I don’t want to risk my sobriety messing about. I’m having a hard time as I just had a death in my family and going through a transitional period of homelessness all the sudden with an infant child and nothing makes you want to give up more than that but I am working my ass off to change it but having mild withdraw symptoms (insomnia and stomach rumble, usually I am falling asleep in minutes, sometimes seconds from laying down and feel sleepy during the day) and intense cravings. 

If you have any experience with this brand let me know. 
Or if you can confirm that they should have numbers or if they are totally okay and I’m just crazy.

8juyt9,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8juyt9/need_reassurance/,11,https://redd.it/8juyt9,EqualResponsibility,Need Reassurance,"TL:DR; For people who jumped from Bupe to Kratom what wad their starting dose and how often did they need to refuse? I’m finding I have to redose every three hours. 

I’ve finally taken my last Buprenorphine dose over 37 hours ago. It was a 1mg sublingual split. I haven’t gone a day without my buprenorphine in three years. Today is a monumental day in that regards.

I’ve been using Kratom to stay off the withdrawals the best I can and wanted to share my experience and get some advice from others who went Subs/Bupe to Kratom. 

First, I’m ok not feeling 100% all the time. If I do then itll just make things worse when I’m finally off and PAWS sets in. 

Last night I had RLS. Which is pretty weird because I haven’t had that in a really long time. It makes me think Kratom is not able to stop all of the withdrawals that the Bupe is causing. Again, this is positive to me. Because it means I can slow roll my way through the withdrawals. 

I’ve put my kratom in pill form as it tends to work best for me. The issue I’m having is trying to understand if I’m taking enough of it. I tend to take only 5 caps which comes out to 4g of Kratom. When I was going through the RLS last night I had to take 7 caps (5.5g) then another 3 caps half an hour later to get the pain to stop. 

The Kratom seems to only last a solid 2.5 hours with at least half an hour start time. I am missing part of my bowels to Crohn’s so I suspect that’s part of it. 

Based on my calculations from yesterday it took around 32g of Kratom for me to barely make it through the day. Is this a lot? I’m reading people who take a SINGLE dose of 15g in the AM and then more six hours later. This seems insanely high to me.

I’m curious what doses others have used and the best tapering strategy, because the doses don’t seem to last that long I’m already on a short dosing cycle. Perhaps I need to be taking 10+ grams for it to last longer?

I just need encouragement. I’ve gotten off of Oxy twice and it was a walk in the park compared to this buprenorphine. Last time I stopped the buprenorphine I was in acute withdrawals for a week and had to start again and taper even lower.

The anxiety for me is the worst of everything. I survive, somehow, on three hours of sleep now. And because of the Crohn’s puking, nausea, and abdominal pain is my every day life. It’s the unbearable depression, crying, and skin crawling anxiety. 

I’d say the Kratom takes my withdrawals from a 7 down to a 3 if I take more when the anxiety hits. My symptoms manifest with Anxiety first, yawning and then sweats. The anxiety is my blood pressure from all the readings I’ve had done. It spikes to 160/100. 

Someone mentioned that if I took the Oxy for anxiety that this is leading to the anxiety being the worst symptom. I think they’re right as I would take the Oxy for anxiety. Anxiety of pain from my stomach. I’d be ok being on the Bupe for life if it wasn’t so expensive and didn’t have such horrible side effects. And id of been ok with being on pain killers if it wasn’t for the tolerance effect. 

Having gotten of pain meds twice and starting again due to a Crohn’s flair I have to do something different this time. I’m not sure what I’ll do, but the emotional dulling that buprenorphine causes is aweful. It makes sex aweful. It makes life awful unless you dose. It does help with pain and it completely removes the withdrawal. But what’s life without pain? I’ll never know.  ",1526477849.0

Now that school's over, I'm going to take a break from all these drugs. Meth isn't that hard to put down for me so I'm not worried about that. For benzo (clonazolam) taper, I'm at 3 doses of 0.25mg in morning, 0.125mg mid afternoon, and 0.125-0.25mg at night. Ezpz taper, gunna use clonazolam until I'm down to 2 doses of 0.125mg a day then jump off using phenibut, gabapentin, etc. Done it before, it's not so hard for me.

Now with opioid WDs; do I use bupe or kratom to taper? 1mg of snorted bupe makes my WDs go away, but they're only bad the day of peak. My professional junkie friend said bupe. But I'm opposed to the idea because the jump off is going to be so prolonges. Kratom, on the other hand, seems to offer a better alternative.

I've never tried it, never saw the point until now. I'm under the impression that while I'll have to dose more frequently, the jump off is not going to be nearly as bad or long. Also since doses are so controllable, I could theoretically lower my doses to the point where WDs would just be some runny tummy and mild discomfort, right?

So I have 1 8mg Subutex. I have2-4 8mg Subuxone. I also have 2 10mg Methadone pills. 

I am trying to acquire either A. More Subutex or B. More Methadone. I would be psyched to even have 1 more Subutex... I bought 5, and gave them to someone who I thought was my best friend. A few times I had mentioned that I only needed one from her and I'd be comfortable kicking. Naturally, she began to kick last weekend and I haven't heard a peep from her. She really broke my heart, honestly. The one person I thought I could trust, was the closest thing I had to a ride or die. Or so I thought. It's been one huge punch to the stomach with the the way I don't even exist to her anymore. She ghosted on me, and didn't even thank me for those Subutex. I took the bullet for her, and now I wound up living with the consequences. This feeling of eternal loneliness is too hard to live with, so I figure the best way to get over it is to get clean and, IDK, go from there.

Sorry for the sob story tangent. 

Anyways, with my 1 subutex, 2+ strips of Suboxone (easy to acquire) and very small amount of methadone, how would you recommend I go about a taper?

RN, my plan is to take that 1 subutex right when I start feeling iffy, and ride that out for as close to a day as i can, then start subbing with suboxone. I guess all I can do is taper with Suboxone until day 4-5? Or until I feel I don't need it? I don't think the 20mg methadone does me any good, really. I can't use them until I'm done taking any BUPE, and unless I have a substantial amount, I don't see it being a factor. Dying to get more subutex, and praying for a miracle, but unfortunately I don't see my guy coming through by weeks end seeing as I want to start withdrawing on Friday. 

Any tips or advice? Thanks guys. Wish me luck. Hope I start to feel better, physically but most importantly mentally. I haven't felt this down in an awfully long time. ",1526451735.0

I feel like I’ve given a lot of potentially disparaging advice about the crybabies who are too scared to hit the streets and get their hands dirty in order to find a plug. Ok that’s just me fucking around and being an asshole unnecessarily. I do have sympathy and genuinely know how shitty it is when it’s hard\-up: a dope\-desert out there, with no reliable plugs to be found. That shit sucks.

First, a little opi background on me: I’ve been using dope \(bth\) for over a decade. Shooting for 9 or so years, and cold\-copping in new cities for about that long as well. It first started when I moved to the Pacific NW at 19 and decided to scope out the city to relapse on dope after a period of being \(mostly\) clean from opiates \(this was all to my detriment, of course\). I started my hunt downtown, talking to homeless dudes, when I more or less met the guy who would be my plug for the next few months \(until I got strung out and kicked out of my apartment\). This was after only an hour or so of searching. Pretty good luck, I'd say.

Eventually, I honed that ""luck"" into the method I've used ever since: go downtown, to a shelter or to a sketchy part of town, hit the streets and start talking to people. I’ve lived in and copped in various new and unfamiliar cities, in many states, even in different countries. I was ripped off a few times in the early days or in desperate times where my guard was down, but have pretty well learned how to navigate the streets as well as the people out hustling on ‘em.

This was my line of thinking at least, as I was flying to a city I’ve never been before to visit my brother. I was curious if I still had it in me, and decided to put it to the test \(for science, of course\). Totally unfamiliar city. No contacts, no connects, no rig. Now, I’m trying to stay clean but fucked up and used H the day before I flew out after a couple weeks of staying away. So I figured I’d only take the little cash I had on me \($30\) to see what I could hustle up, just to take the day\-after shitty feeling away.

Thus, my adventure began. I hit the streets, pretty well starting downtown, hopping on a random bus, hoping it would end up in a more sketchy area. I was originally planning on copping near downtown, but I could see that the areas were getting sketchier and sketchier the further I rode out of the city, so I just stuck with it for probably 20 minutes or so. I eventually hopped off in a place that screamed sketchy/crime/dope. My heroin\-senses were certainly tingling.

And… I was officially on the hunt. I started talking to the dudes on the street who looked hard\-up, worse for wear, potentially homeless. From my experience, many of these folks are either users with connects or at least have a line on someone who does. Almost immediately, I ran into a dude who said he would help me score. He took me down a back street behind some businesses, past a shitty church and a fairly run\-down neighborhood. Eventually, the street led to the little cut into the forest. He took me down a path littered with trash and random shit, to a VERY sketchy little tweaker lair in the forest. It was pretty creepy. Definitely wouldn’t recommend this for beginners, but I wasn’t too worried. I’ve been unwillingly dragged to similar places in the past, and knew such folks are usually harmless, all things considered. I also got a pretty good read on the guy who was leading me around, and I didn’t get the vibe that he was trying to run me around or hustle me out of my money. He actually had a little black on him as well as some pills. It wasn’t much or enough to do anything for me, but I figured he at least had some connections. He split the dope with his buddy down in the forest dwelling who gave him some speed. They took fucking FOREVER \(it seemed\) mixing up their little goofball shot and I was getting inpatient, as the main dude he was looking for wasn’t even down in the tweaker lair. They were sitting on a grimy mattress mixing their shots and smoking speed. They offered me a few hits and a cigarette, which I took. Felt a little better after that. I was carrying a book, and actually sparked a conversation and started talking politics with another guy who was down there tweaking, doing speed. Overall, it wasn’t as creepy or as uncomfortable as it could of been. The hospitality could’ve been a lot worse, to be certain.

Eventually, we took off to a spot where he supposedly knew a guy who had a plug. We left the forest tweaker lair, back to the street. It took a minute for us to walk over to this guy’s little haunt, a Mexican restaurant back up the same road and across the highway entrance/intersection. On the way, my guide somehow accidentally squirted his little goofball shot out into his pocket. He wasn’t too happy about that. We got to the restaurant and ran into another guy who was also looking for H. He said he could score, but I definitely got a bad vibe from this guy and had that gut feeling he was going to try and hustle me out of the little money I had. Always trust your gut, people. So I decided against going with him and to wait it out instead. Only a few minutes later this little Mexican dude on a bike \(the guy who supposedly had the plug\) rolled up and said he’d hook me up, that he actually had it on him.

Immediately, I felt relief. It had probably only been 2 maybe 3 hours since I had started out. I didn’t realize how anxious and inpatient and, well, SICK I was getting. I hadn't noticed the ache in my legs, the sweat beading down my back. Not until I felt that sweet, immediate relief when he said that he could help me out and had the shit on him. He went to the bathroom in the restaurant and made up the bag of dope. Now, I know better than to get my hopes up in situations like this. So I tried to keep them in check, while planning my next move if this fell guy fell through or was bullshitting me. He came back and handed me the bag. It was a little small, especially compared to the amounts/prices I’m used to. But he also threw in a new rig as I didn’t have one and was probably unlikely to find one out there. So I figured it was a fair enough deal.

I immediately went into the bathroom of the Mexican restaurant, cooked up the shit, fixed a shot and blasted off. It was actually good dope, and just enough to get me well/feeling pretty good. Afterwards, I hiked back up the street and hopped on the bus, kinda fucked up and nodding, and proceeded to get lost downtown for the next two and a half hours. And that’s it folks! The rest of my stay there was me feeling shitty and depressed, babysitting children, and getting back on my suboxone regiment. Thanks for reading, and good luck with all your future cold\-copping endeavors. Happy hustlin’!",1526447319.0

In Britain, some doctors are allowed to prescribe medical heroin to frequent opioid users.  This has been true for decades.

The freeze-dried form of medical heroin used in Britain is expensive.  It costs the government perhaps £14,500 per medical-heroin patient per year.  [(Source.)](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/heroin-prescription-diamorphine_uk_57fd2f6ee4b0430f66f67894)

Still, medical-heroin treatment (also called ""heroin-assisted treatment"") is worth the money.  It reduces the incidence of crime, unemployment, abscess, HIV, disease, overdose, and death.  [(Source.)](https://www.spectator.co.uk/2015/05/the-case-for-prescription-heroin/)

Currently, about 30 doctors in Britain prescribe medical heroin.  [(Source.)](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-115352/Heroin-NHS.html)  But most doctors don't.  Methadone and Suboxone are much more common.

# Medical heroin elsewhere

Medical-heroin programs have also been established in Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Denmark, Belgium, and Luxembourg.  [(Source.)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid_use_disorder#Heroin-assisted_treatment)

# In the US

In America, frequent opioid users can get methadone or Suboxone from a doctor.

Unfortunately, Americans can't yet obtain medical heroin.  It would be legal to launch a medical-heroin pilot project in the US, but nobody has yet done so.  [(Source.)](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/treating-heroin-addiction-with-heroin-what-you-need-to-know-w494829)

There are various abuse-deterrent morphine-based opioid products available in the US, such as MorphaBond ER, Arymo ER, and Embeda.  Morphine is a useful drug for treating frequent opioid users who don't do well on methadone or Suboxone.  [(Source.)](http://doi.org/10.1211/PJ.2013.11124143)  Still, I have no idea whether or not any methadone clinics in the US are willing to prescribe slow-release morphine to their patients.",1526441312.0

At the time I was crystal clear that is all I could provide, that I could pay that debt but I wouldn't be in a position to loan more than that. I told him this up front so that he'd have the option not to loan me a bun's worth but in his words, ""I'm more comfortable sending you to the ATM than sending Derrick \(the middle\)."" Without me getting the option to borrow a bun's worth of dope in addition to two free bags, I would not have biked to the ATM for Cliff with his card at 4AM last week. 

So tomorrow he might just text me around the time I'm expected to get paid to ensure he gets the money I owe him. Then what? He will most certainly ask if I plan on buying anything \(dope\) on that day. It's tempting, and it is a temptation that has consistently resulted in me buying myself dope in the past. I've clamped down due to experience and shear necessity to have money left for other things after pay day. After paying back a debt, if I buy myself dope on a day that Cliff is broke, I'm likely to buy one additional bun to loan him. Since I don't plan on buying myself dope, I don't see a reason to loan him money for dope.

Now, although I won't do that, I will likely throw Cliff a sub or two while stocking up. Nothing more, only what I'm willing and able to lose even if he does end up paying me back at some point. Now, other than that... if I did want to buy dope, I would go directly to the middle and bypass Cliff. If he begs me to borrow money for dope because he can't buy any for at least a week, offering a sub or two will be a generous and cost effective alternative. If he does not want to accept, that's his loss. He will end up getting neither subs or dope. If he accepts, he will have made the wise decision to have something to dose for four days. If he takes a full sub and ends up suddently empty once more, that's on him. I will have done my due diligence. 

He might've learned a lesson from that time when he waited at my doorstep for two hours in the snow. Well not so much him, I learned a lesson from that scenario. Tomorrow if confronted, I may end up outright pointing out ways he's full of shit. My father isn't home tomorrow, if he comes knocking I can be as loud as I want in expressing myself. His first hope will be that I pay back my debt to him and choose to buy dope. The second hope will be that I offer to loan him money for dope even if I don't get any for myself. His last hope, which will likely not be on his mind but offered by me will be the subs. I have no obligation, but it looks good on me when he says ""I always help you out"" when asking for a favor. Now I will have a recent scenario where I did help out withotu the resentment that comes with spending more than $20 to help out a friend who always pays back cash debts in the form of goods that cost them less. 

With all that being said, I have a job interview at the end of the week. I've been taking subs for nearly a week now and have been tapering down my dosage. If I get the job, a drug test is almost completely inevitable. There is a chance that the test won't screen for bupe, but I still want to get my dose down so I have a fighting chance at diluting my void in effort to reduce the detectability of drug metabolites.  

Now here's an alternate scenario. I buy dope tomorrow, by whatever means.... ideally bypassing Cliff because I don't want to spend more than what I spending for my own wants and needs. After I finish a bun or two buns of dope.. I will have reset myself. I will then have to go back on suboxone as the dope\-sickness sets in. That will likely be around 4mg. If on the other hand, I don't consume dope before my job interview or on pay day... I will be on a dose that is below 2mg. That means that if I get a drug test next week, I'll have a much better chance of passing it if it even tries to detect bupe. Being that my financial well being and future is affected by the outcome of this job interview and the subsequent drug test, there is no level of talk, promises or convincing that can get me to cave in to temptation. Not tomorrow. The day after the job interview? It'll be tempting and I'll likely try to convince myself by saying ""heroin can only be detected within 72 hours of use, I can flush that out no problem."" However, the subsequent dose of buprenorphine if screened for will surely be detectable. 

So bottom line; tomorrow we might get a Cliff post involving me getting paid, Cliff begging me to give him more money in addition to what I owe him for a bun of dope. I'll then offer him a couple of subs because I'm not callous. He'll likely be disappointed if he accepts. I once wrote post about how Cliff says he can and wants to get subs but his actions indicate the opposite. A post of mine tried to explore this situation, one of the comments aptly stated ""Because the same way some guys think with their dick and get really fucking stupid around chicks, some junkies think with their nose/arm/asshole and are incredibly stupid when it comes to short\-term vs long\-term rewards.""

Some months after [writing this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8jiz12/whats_the_stupidest_things_youve_done_to_try_to/), I told Cliff about one of the other comments. I didn't tell him the post was about him, but I did quote the comment where someone amusingly said, ""\[...\] Shit tastes like fucking failure and disappointment."" 

Well, I rephrased and said to him that someone said ""subs taste like disappointment."" Cliff immediately bursted out laughing. It was obvious that such a statement resonated with him. Thus it's no surprise when I've offered to buy subs early in our pay cycles twice in the past three weeks and each time Cliff expressed disinterest in doing so. The second time he indicated interest but by the time I he really needed them he only hadf $20 in his account due to spending more money on dope while waiting for subs to become available and possibly food because his mom kindof get's on his ass when she hasn't eaten more than two meals in two days. 

So now, past couple of days he asked for a half a sub. On one day I gave him and 4mg and pretended to have just 2 left. When he asked again yesterday I said I had none and gave him the sort of BS he would give me if the tables were turned. I've given him opportunities to stock up and so I don't feel that I should cut into my own supply a week later. What kind of message does that send? It says he can continue not to think about the future, that he can just wait til last minute and get relief in the form of subs when all other options are exhausted. I've seldom had such luck when I was in his position, so I don't see why I should reward his his lack of foresight \-\- his choice not to be prepared. ",1526416115.0

When it hasn't been moist it would normally just be ROCK hard. Like you would need to smash it up like a pill. I can't tell if it smells real vinegary because I can't smell, but it used to when it was this wet. 

EDIT: I just read on another forum that the moisture is added so it can be repressed into a rock. I'm not sure how true that is because it doesn't rock up very well when it's moist, but maybe when it dries out it does.It's more like chunks.

Of course it was found when I was just helping out a kid and wasn't looking.  

There is an abandoned gas station off one of the main streets heading towards the city that has decent pavement and a few spots to skate. I'm old now, like old enough I still find it odd to use emojis, but still like to push around on my board do small flips and drops. Yesterday a couple of kids where there shredding pretty hard. We talked a little, they asked if I wanted to hit their vape pen (oh my god technology is awesome!) and discussed obscure music.  There is a decent gap that (we'll call him:) Slim kept charging at full speed over and over but was an inch or so from clearing.  So what eventually happens? He eats shit,  HARD.  Bleeding from his chin, arm tore up, pants shredded he is fucking hurting too bad to skate and mentions he's got like a 3 mile walk home.

 ""You want a ride, homie?""  ""Seriously?  Hell yes.  Thank you thank you thank you!""  He grabs his shit and we hop in my truck to leave.  As he is directing me to his house, it becomes obvious he lives in the cut.  ""Hey man, thanks again for the ride.  You want a little weed or something for the gas?"" 💡""Yeah, I'd appreciate that.  But you know what I really would like?  Some blues or some dog food!""  ""Shit, really?  You don't look like a junkie, but yeah, my big bro sells that shit. Let me grab him""

After a few minutes of sitting in the driveway, out walks a well dressed, no face tats kids thats probably about 25 years old.  ""You good?"" Yea, I'm good.  ""Here (throws me a little baggie). Thanks for looking out for the kid.  Take my number, call me if you need more.""  Alright.

I drive home, open up the baggie.  There's almost a half a g in here!  And it's good too.  I've got pretty spoiled off of DNM, but this stuff is pretty close in comparison.

According to science all anecdotal reports, I should've felt NOTHING. Especially with the .2 shot I did.

But no, I got higher than I've been in 5 years. If I broke thru, I have no idea how.

Naltrexone DOES lower opiate tolerance, which explains why I was puking my brains out but it doesn't explain why it didn't block the shot.

I also did some on Sunday... 3 days after shot #3 and while I didn't feel anything super strong, I did get a nice mood boost, and a little of the warm tingles.

There's also something else worth considering ... Since I did some on that Monday, and my shot was on Thursday, I should've popped for dope at the doctor, but my UA was 100% clean. From the results I saw, it doesnt look like they test for fent or its analogues... In fact the only opiate on the list is morphine.

So maybe I got a super potent fent analogue that cuts through naltrexone like butter?

I started taking oxycodone 10s about 3 years ago for a then undiagnosed chronic pain disorder. I was on the oxy's for several months before I started upping my dose on my own, and pretty soon I was in a full blown addiction, taking 40 mgs in the morning, afternoon, and before bed. This lasted for about 8 months. About 3 months into my addiction I noticed I didn't feel the ""high"" from the pills unless I stayed still, mainly my legs. I would have to sit down on the couch, or lay in bed keeping my lower half completely still to get the high, and if I moved, it was gone. This made it very difficult to do anything with my life. I got dehydrated because I wouldn't get up to get a glass of water. I barely left my bedroom for the next 5 months because then I wasn't able to get high. I could take the pills to keep the withdrawal symptoms at bay if I had to go out, but I felt virtually nothing other than relief from withdrawals. Later when my doctor found out I was getting pills on the side from other sources he was really understanding about my situation, even though he almost lost his medical license, and he got me into a fantastic pain rehabilitation program at Mayo Clinic. I got off the pills, got a diagnosis for my chronic pain disorder, and have spent the past 2 years completely drug free! I didn't get an answer for my question though, even at the prestigious Mayo Clinic. I recently had a particularly bad case of appendicitis and spent a few days in the hospital recovering and needed to be on pain meds when I got home, even though I really didn't want to. Once again I noticed I didn't feel the effects unless I stayed completely still from the waist down! I took the pills for a day at home, but I didn't want to get trapped in that same cycle again so I threw them out and stuck with OTC meds, which was brutal. Anyways, sorry this post was so long but if anyone else has experienced this or knows why this happens to me please let me know! ",1526394457.0

Opiates make the time pass so quickly and they make you not give a shit about anything. 

I was hundreds of dollars in dept last week and I went out bought some oxy and walked outside down my rural streets fucked out of my skull smoking cigarettes. I didn’t have a fucking care in the world 

Mother’s Day rolled around but I wasn’t able to go out with my family and do things the whole day, I took way to much oxy and started puking my guts up and could barely move all weekend.  Which really made me think that I’m a fucking addict.

But this is different than doing lines of blow, with that you just fiend and want more but the next day the feelings gone, this is a indescribable feeling, it’s like I just need the shit to function. Oh I don’t have a 80 to get me through the day? Then fuck going to work.

Now I’m sitting here at 7 in the morning trying to push out a shit and so far I’ve gotten a turd out the size of a marble. I’m dope sick, I’m out of oxy and I need to go to work. 

Fuck this lifestyle, for all the new people trying opiates here please stop while your ahead. No drug has ever gripped me like this and I’ve done over 20 different drugs

What's worse than getting ripped off when you're sick? Getting ripped off a second time in the same day. Isn't great that people take advantage of those who are desperate and hurting? Guess I'm not sleeping tonight. Sucks, but I've been through worse WDs before. 

What really gets my goat is that the tweakers who ripped me off the second time acted as if I should be thanking them for it. They said ""anyone else would hurt you, we're just ripping you off, and that way you won't OD, so really we're helping"". I'm guessing they figure other people would hurt me on account of me being a transgender woman. Well thanks for the help. This next bout of vomiting goes out to you two.

Chemically/hormonally?,"I have a loved one who struggles with addiction, but has been doing very well for the past two years through therapy and rehab. She still considers herself an addict and does not want to try opiates again, but (of course) misses how productive and at ease she felt when she first started doing opiates and eventually 10 or so years of heroin.

I don’t know if the productive feeling is common, but I understand what she means, as the dozen or so times I’ve taken Norco recreationally I turned into a cleaning machine. I would stay up for 48 hours, wash my car, rearrange my room, etc. My anxiety would disappear and I would perform better at work, was more outgoing, it was great. Based on what she’s told me, it sounds like she reacts in a similar (slightly uncommon) way as I do. 

Are there any other less addictive treatments which could possibly trigger any of the same feelings of relief and productivity, even on a much smaller scale? She feels her 7 years of therapy was a waste and depression is beginning to take it’s toll. She’s been on anti-depressants and anti-anxiety meds and doesn’t believe either helped her much. I would be open to learning about any forms of alternate treatment, i believe mushrooms have helped me in certain similar aspects of my own life, so we’ve discussed psychedelics/ayahuasca treatments. I’m just not sure if that’s a crock of shit as well?

Id still be honored if ud read my post. I kinda wanna vent a lil.

I got into drugs early, tried drugd in the US with 15 (moved to Germany tho and jst went back for a year back then ). Having lived in a conservative german upper middle class community, it for real broke my mind. This trip changed my life.

I used to be very introverted. Also played lotsa guitar, getting into that atm again which is cool :) but yea I always wanted more than that ""golden cage "". So i broke out. With weed first which was enough to get banned from their ugly community. I saw behind these nice faces the first time as they harassed my brother. 
I got deeper, H w 17, got clean went to uni relapse 2 year addiction Iv all that xcept jail. Thats the next step honestly. 
So i almost died on a trip to mexico due to my own stupididty. ODed a week after I came back and told my parents after 'well who cares wouldnt be worse' .

My dads a covert narc. Hes old and conservative and as Jordan Peterson (dnt wanna tlk bout him or politics pls) said, theres nothing worse than a sick person living w a highly conscientous person. He always emotionally mistreated all of us, which led me to drugs s lil but boo hoo. 

I moved out in March. Went back to uni and worked out a plan to get the minimal legible support from my parents w some restrictions tho. Started to repair bridges altho most have been burned. In my mind I made a lot of hurdles even tho im on MMT and occasionally use. Phenibut semi regularly, wanna dose that down tho. Dont use it erryday. Someimes valium; sometimes H if its good, usually weed and social drinking. Im in college soo yea I get drunk a lil and bang chicks hahsh. Way better than sitting in a room alone w a needle in my arm. Whenever i stray I visualize myself back to Mexico. Or my bloody flat that was a shithole.

I mean theres a lot i still fck up. Esp behaviourlly. The time in the scene left scars esp the violence i endured and saw. Guess i got a light version of ptsd. Nt to belittle real survivors but I got lucky too. Not just once. I actually pray to santa muerte. Youre the first I tell. Its not to feel global or sum shit, ik im german. But she represents all thats about me somehow. And I grew up Catholic even tho I reject the institution and am mostly agnostic. But we. If we have a saint ill take my chances. 

Things are looking up. I show up. Got a interview friday to supplement my resources . Mmt here is a bitch, i live in East Germany atm. They treat u like criminal low lifes and are always astonished when I show will to improve. Thankfully I always prepare now. Never used to. But almost dying changed me. Yall know that? Its rly weird.i thought id be stuck all my life.

I will be in berlin visiting friends nxt week, theres a slim chance  might ve able to finish my BA there. Got more friends there than here, also a real high achieving one, I study media so that would fit and their programs are like wooooorlds better. Most progressive. I must say I aint a fan of the ""new left"" but I really appreciate liberalism (libertarianism for u guys ) here.

I got hep c. Like they found anti bodys, did a pcl-r and my counts like 40. They say ths hella low and theres a 50/50 chance it might go away. No symptoms or higher liver ""werte "" idk lol tho. And i take gym supps which would support that. 

Anyone know bout that?

Also any tricks u got for sex on opiates/mmt for guys lol
