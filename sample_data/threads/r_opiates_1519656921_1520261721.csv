What's been helpful, and relapsing.","Ok I wasn't sure I wanted to do this but after all the help I've gotten from this community over the last month I feel I owe something back. Over the past year I have been severely addicted to opiates. Pain pills to be exact (blues), I was doing about 150mg a day at my worst. 

I knew I wanted to quit for a while, but the fear of withdrawal was so great that I began with tapering down to about 60mg a day and finally down to 30mg a day before trying to stop all together. I can say unequivocally that this has been the hardest shittiest process I've ever had to deal with. I've been able to not do any during the week but over the past few weekends I've relapsed after 5-6 days of being clean.

The only way I've made it this far has been with the help of kratom. I take maeng da during the day to get through work, and then I take red vein at night to be able to sleep. 

I know many people will say that I'm prolonging the wd process with kratom and that relapsing every weekend is setting me back in my healing process and this is all true; however, I have been able to string together more days in between using blues each week and have been able to cut down how much I use when I do relapse each time. 

This is a extremely hard process and I am making this post to let people know that just because you relapse does not mean all your hard work has been for nothing. The relapse rate for opiate addiction is extremely high, I want to say I read that it is about 90%. If you do relapse these are some helpful guidlines: -don't do much, do as little as you can and make sure you don't buy enough so that you do more the next day. -string as many days as you can without doing any before you use again, and if you're weak like me and realize that you will probably relapse again, try to make it more days between each time you relapse and try to use less each time. -don't give up, you fucked up, it's ok, it happens to almost everyone. It doesn't mean you're starting from square one, but do keep in mind that it is a setback each time it happens.

When you are finally at the point where you don't think you'll relapse again, that's when you know you're not chasing the high like you were before and you might be able to quit for good. This is the point I'm trying to get to. I went 8 days before I crumbled and relapsed (tonight). I was able to go longer and do less than last time. Am I setting myself back? Absolutely, but that does not mean I'm going to give up everything I've done in the last month and go back to using. If I do relapse again I will make sure it's at least two weeks from tonight. 

Many of you might say I'm being stupid and I'm not serious about quitting. Although I do agree I am stupid, I will say I have come a long way and I am serious about quitting for good. I see these relapses as errors and weakness but I don't see them as giving up on quitting. I'm writing this post to help those who are trying to quit and who are having trouble with relapse. You can do this, you can quit. Will relapsing set you back? Yes, but not necessarily all the way back. No one can really know how much it will set you back because there are too many variables: how much were you using, how many days since you last used, how much did you use? Just don't give up and go back to daily use. Just see it as a setback and get back to being clean for as many days as you can, every day helps. 

I highly recommend a few things for quitting. 
-Have someone you can talk to about it who knows how hard it is to quit. At the very least, talk to people in this reddit group. There is a lot of helpful info and plenty of people who would love to help you, all you have to do is ask. 
-Understand it won't be an easy or quick process. You did damage to your brain and it is going to take time for it to heal itself back to 100%, it might even take longer than a month.
-If you don't want to go through rehab which I certainly don't, you are going to need to take supplements to help you heal. I have found kratom to be extremely helpful with the day to day healing. It's not going to fix everything, but it will help you with some of the wd symptoms and it will help you sleep which is very important. You're going to need to eat very healthy, eating fruits and veggies will help you get vitamins and minerals that your body needs to help heal itself. 
-You also need to exercise. It will be hard at first because you will be suffering from low energy so start slow with just walks outside, when you feel your energy coming back you can start going to the gym if your up for it but remember to take it slow or you will fatigue yourself and have worse wd symptoms.

All in all I made this to say that you can do this and I can too. This whole process sucks and hopefully it scares us both into not ever wanting to go back to using. Just remember that just because you relapse once does not mean everything thus far was for not. It is very hard to overcome this addiction and you probably will make mistakes, just make sure you are learning from them and trying to come back stronger. 

You are not alone and if you need someone to talk to I am happy to help. I usually only check this at night but I will try to respond to whoever I can, my apologies if it takes a few days. Good luck to everyone quitting or at least trying, it's hard but try to be proud of yourself for trying to improve yourself. Just take it a day at a time and remember that it can and will get better if you let it.",1519710960.0

He's been doing his own thing as I've been doing mine. So anyways I've talked about this friend before, he gets thousands and thousands of dollars cause he's native. So naturally when we hang out we do pills and get fucked up together. Well the first pills we ever started doing were xanny bars. So I moved away for a while for other reasons and I came back like 5/6 months ago we obviously we started chilling again since I was finally close enough. So he'd bring over xans n shit and he'd be genuinely suprised and confused when I'd tell him I didn't want to do any. But I haven't seen him in weeks probably months and I heard from my old co-workers/ friend the he was up at old work last night cause that's where everyone goesnt to hangout. ( Free fast food, a place to get fucked up at, managers sell white girl and bud too, besides it being a fast food joint it's just a chill place to get fucked up at) and my best friend stole 40$ from the cash register drawer and then he went to one of our other co-workers house's to hang out and they got all xanned out and my best friend stole a bunch of Xbox one video games and controllers and shit from our co-workers house. He's in deep shit and I just found out he's been doing percs still too when he's swore to me he's sober a thousand times calling me crying saying he's so disgusted when he looks in the mirror cause he's lost so much weight from doing so much drugs yada yada. I just feel guilty cause I feel like he's stealing to pay for his percs. Xans are 3-7$ tops where we live there not an expensive addiction whatsoever plus if he's stealing for money that means he's already spent all his money he gets from the government ( ranges every month from 7-10,000$ ) and that's ALOT of money to blow on pills in such a short period of time.

I told my plug this in advance so that when I didn’t cop certain days or something then she would know what’s up. Today, I asked if she could help me out with a 30 and she said “I’d prefer to do a 40. Can you make ten bucks?” This response really got under my skin considering she’s well aware of my financial situation - so I set out for the homeless shelter to cop instead.

If you’re familiar with my posts, then you know I cold copped for the first time ever at this shelter a week ago. In the last week I’ve gone by here a couple times to try and find the same homie again but he has been MIA! But today? God bless Junkie Jesus or whatever force responsible, but he was there!!!

The minute I rolled up he told me to take a seat and tells me he’s got gunpowder today as opposed to the goopy tar I got last time. He sold me 60 worth for 40 cuz it was all I had and this shit is soooooo fire! I went home a happy camper.

Here’s where the drama begins. I text my regular connect and tell her I’ll just wait to grab something from her until tomorrow when I have more money. She sends me, no lie, 10+ texts rambling saying she already got me a 30 sack, talking about how I have to come through for it since I already asked for it (it had only been like half an hour, too) and that she’ll be broke and in debt to her plug and just a bunch of BULLSHIT! Now she’s telling me that I’m “hard to please” and needs a couple days off from serving me.

Lol little does she know that I’m completely happy to let her do that. Her dope has been destroying my lungs and barely even gets me right let alone high or nodding. And I’ve waited MULTIPLE DAYS for her to get me my shit after giving her my cash and she’s gonna act like waiting a fucking day for me is gonna ruin her and everything else. Fucking drama queen bullshit.

TL;DR - old dope girl is hella mad and trying to stop serving me because I can’t spend with her the way I used to, even though she regularly rips me off or sells straight garbage. Little does she know, I’m establishing a relationship with a backup plug who has much better stuff lol

At only 20 years old, it’s kind of that decisive point of whether I kick the shit and get clean or spend the remainder my life chasing a ghost.

 My mother and I began using U-4 together, unaware of it being a research chem that not much was published on or known about. She’s been a heroin addict since I was about 5 so it’s nearing 16 years. I had my runs with dope in the past, then 2 spells with fentanyl a year ago. But nothing has come close to touching how fucked this U-4 shit is. 
It was very clear that this wasn’t your run of the mill dope but what exactly it was had eluded me until 2 weeks ago. After reading about it and suffering all the side effects from HEAVY use as well as with the withdrawals, I’m beyond ready to stop blowing all my (direly needed) income on this drug. 
I’ve tried multiple times to taper down using Kratom and loperamide, quit cold turkey (terrifying bc of seizing and slight hallucinations along with symptoms more excruciating than any other WD symptoms I’ve had from other stuff) and at this point I don’t know what else to do. 
Drug clinics or inpatient programs aren’t options as I’m on probation and can not afford the time away from work to get this all straightened out. 

“Despondence” is somewhat accurate if you were to describe the state I’m in; my mom constantly tells me that while it’s simply too late for her, I still have a chance of getting clean and fulfilling the potential I have. Pretty heartbreaking to hear that your own mother pray for death from every dose she takes. I want to be able to help her get a second chance but first I have to be able to do that for myself and not relapse. 
Had U-4 been like fent or ron we both could have been good months ago; there’s something about this stuff though that makes the withdrawals simply unbearable cold turkey and without any other aiding substances. I feel though that too much longer dancing and neither one of us will have to even worry about gettin another bag or trying to get clean anymore. 

I’m basically looking for advice, recommendations or even personal experiences from others just so I have more of an idea of how I can attempt to successfully tackle this beast. ",1519683380.0

How's about an episode where Sam tells a chronic smoker that they'll end up dying slowly in pain from emphysema  and COPD. That cigarette smoking can very likely result in their body slowly shutting down and that with each medication that targets the respiratory system the patient will find that other elements of their health will take a hit.

For example taking certain steroids will help you breathe but can cause your leg muscles to get weakened. Specialists focus on one apsect of your health and are often not too concerned about letting other aspects of health go the wayside.

I use ECP in a big East Coast city, so it comes in bundles of stamps (well, usually blank but the same glassine bags). 

I have no specific reason to think that I'm getting fentanyl -- the bags I get are pretty consistent and seem to be essentially the same stuff that I used to get years ago. Same tan color, same fluffy but slightly flakey consistency, same effects. But from what everyone reports on this sub, fent-free ECP is increasingly rare stuff. 

I sniff, so I can't just test my IV solution before I shoot. I understand that the fent might be mixed unevenly in the bags, so what's the best way to tell if there might be some in a new bundle? Rinse out the residue from a few bags with a tiny bit of water and combine? 

I have never sniffed a line that was weirdly strong -- so if I am getting fent it def is not obvious to me at all. Is there is a chance that I just have sources that aren't selling fent dope? Or is that just a thing of the past?

I just want to let anyone who doubts themselves - you don't need to keep living in active addiction. There is a solution out there and you can get out. 

I have been clean for 11 months and was heavily heavily addicted to Oxycodone. I was using 100-600 mgs of oxy a day for almost 3 years. I am now almost a year clean. 

When I was in active addiction I thought I was stuck and there was no way out. But that's not the truth. You don't need to live that way.

To get clean you need to be willing to give your life up to a power greater than yourself. That doesn't have to be god or a religious figure. It just needs to be something greater than yourself. If you had the ability to control your addiction and get clean you would never have gotten addicted in the first place. 

It's as simple as that. Give it up and do all the right things and you WILL get clean.

I enjoy the occasional nod, but know how easily you can get hooked so never go back and ask for more. 

My problem is, whenever I do them the next morning I wake up and want or do throw up (whether or not I eat or not) and usually have a massive migraine. Never throw up or have issues when I am actually on them, get an upset stomach like most but I don't think I have ever puked on them. Anyone have any ideas on things that may help this ?

So I'm in a sort of pickle here. Well, not really. Not yet. I can get some obsidian bth but 1) I don't like nodding, 2) heroin is best for nodding, and 3) the fucking nausea dude. I don't use opiates often either way so tolerance and physical addiction is not a big deal. That being said, I do so enjoy the warm blanket physical euphoria our dear painkillers induce.

**(tl;dr)** So here's the question (the observant among you probably knows what I'm about to ask): **do I get 8 30mg oxycodone for 250~ or 3 40mg oxymorphone for 190-200?**

My RoA for opioids are almost exclusively intranasal (except roxis; snort quarter, eat half). Being a stim freak, the stimulation oxycodone provides is luvly. If I were to get the 240mg of oxycodone, I would not regret my purchase. I don't know how long that stash would last, but I would not regret my decision. Now, I've only done oxymorphone twice. One G74 in two days. I figured ""hey it has oxy in the name it might be stimulating too."" Lmao no. I nodded off and dont remember either experiences. I wanna try again but it's hard to source locally so I have to go for the 120mg for near 200.

Like I said earlier, this is not a pickle yet. I'm satisfied with smoking bth. I could get at least two gs of 9/10 tar, probably more. So what do? :(

Also, bonus question, which opioid is your favorite? Mine is a split between oxycodone and heroin. Oxycodone is such a nice drug by itself, small doses of cLam and oxy are phenomenal. On the other hand, heroin is much more euphoric and goes great with some meth.",1519628645.0

Recently I've been prescribed gabapentin at the MAX dose of 3,600mg a day. Really it just makes me feel like spacey talkative numb and a relatively mellow but good mood. It kills anxiety extremely well but for pain.. not so much. I distracts me from the pain but I still feel it. However I have recently discovered that if I take kratom extract with it it gives me GREAT pain relief. However I can't afford to constantly buy $20-30 doses of kratom extract shots/pills a day to be pain free. I asked my current GP about adding another medication to the gabapentin but he told me that gabapentin should work by itself and to give it some time to work (I guess a week or two) and gave me the max dose he could. Now my question is.. I'm going to continue taking it and finish the entire prescription in faith but I was wondering is it okay to see another doctor/GP in the area about the same pinched nerve in my neck to try another medicine. I was prescribed tramadol and vicoprofen before and neither worked but the vicoprofen worked to kill 40% of the pain when I took a whoping 6 pills. I was thinking of telling the potential NEW doctor/GP about my pinched nerve problem and the level 6 out of 10 pain I have daily 24/7 and that I am not taking anything else but my adhd meds and zoloft and that I HAVE tried tramadol, vicoprofen, gabapentin and they haven't done anything. However I'm scared that he will know I'm seeing another doctor for pain medicine already and I will get flagged as a drug abuser/drug seeker etc. Does anyone have any experience with this?? Realistically, I want to try another opiate/opioid narcotic medication because vicoprofen worked in the 50-60mg range. Maybe codeine would work even though its a lower level med, I don't know how ""liberal"" this new one is. He's a pediatric and adolescent medicine GP/doctor so idk if he would even prescribe narcotics/pain medicine but the other doctor had a sign saying WE DO NOT PRESCRIBE NARCOTIC PAIN MEDICATION. But just after the second visit I was given vicoprofen so I have high hopes. I just want to see if a stronger opiate or another opioid would work well with the gabapentin I'm taking. Really the gabapentin doesn't kill pain it just sort of makes me not care, but with kratom extract which is basically an opioid it totally KILLS ALL pain which is why I want to try an opiate.

Have you guys had similar experiences when using this for withdraw? 

I did double my prescribed dose but shit, I've got heaps of the stuff now. Kind of scary because it makes me think I have this magic bullet, as so if I wanted I could jump off and on this opiate train freely!

I mean, unless you have a witty one.

[Serious] Hypothetically, is there an anonymous drop box option or would I be questioned trying to turn it into police? If not, **why not**?

Obviously the toilet is an option, but (bear with me) I hear about drug pollution entering our water supply via sewer and I don't really want to be a part of that if I can avoid it.

Then there's the landfill option (can leach into soil or groundwater, not to mention mass powder pluming out of some poor gas station's dumpster when it's emptied).

Burning it would no doubt create some measurable amount of toxic air pollution, but it seems the safest and honestly, most mystical/symbolic method of putting this behind me.

As someone who doesn't support drug prohibition, this actually has my mind sort of analysing every option. *Do police even destroy the drugs they steal?* Bury it as a fucked up nest egg for if and when currency is devalued in some apocalyptic future? What if my loved one is kidnapped for ransom and I don't have any liquid assets?

Fuck this. I feel like I'm storing someone's dead body right now. Also, there's no good information about criminal charges for **1** brick of heroin. All the news articles are about *85 bricks of heroin found in the apartment of suspected blah blah*. Obviously I'm overthinking this, but can you blame me?

I don't use opiates. I don't get along with opiate users. Closest thing to bonafide demon exorcism is watching someone you know quit them for good and wake the fuck up. I hate that it's in my possession, but it's better off here than where it was.",1519752932.0

So far as of today, I’ve got 144 days clean and sober. I have to say it, but getting sober was probably the best decision I could have ever made in my life.  I’ve made some pretty good choices, but getting clean and going into a recovery program was the best choice I’ve made in a long long time.  This is the longest I’ve had clean and I’ve never felt better. Gained so much in my life I lost using H.  I’ve gotten respect from my family (most importantly my mom cause she means the world to me being she’s the only parent I’ve got) my closest friends who knew I had a problem and were glad I went thru rehab, and the respect of others I’ve met along the way who I’ve told what I use to do.  I’m finally able to do things I never thought of ever doing while using. I’ve got my DJ equipment back (how I got it is another story for another day) my Xbox back, and basically my social life back.  Some may say that if I used one time, I’ll back to my old ways, and I know that’s true, but I’m using fear as my motivation, fear that If I use again, I’ll be dead.  Reason being that if I was to go back out and use the same amount that I was doing before I got sober, I KNOW I would OD and be dead in a ditch somewhere, and I never slammed, only smoked... but still, that would absolutely break my moms heart, and I can’t do that to her after everything I’ve already put her through and what’s she’s had to deal with in her life from loosing both her parents. Last thing she needs is loosing her only son who’s come so far after being trapped in the clutches of this.  Getting sober gave me my life back and gave me the chance to finally go out and achieve what I’ve always taken shots at, which is becoming a DJ/Producer and going and doing things I would have never done before because all I would care about is getting loaded.  Sorry to get all preachy, just thought that maybe this post might encourage some people to do the same.  

Now this is where some of you might try and slam me down for this, but whatever. I say that I have 144 days clean, but that’s only being clean from H.  I still have the very occasional beer, occasional being once every 2-3 weeks.  I still smoke weed occasionally as well (cause it’s legal here in Cali...finally lol) but that’s because I never had any problems with those like I did H.  Some of you may say that I don’t have sobriety being I’m drinking or smoking weed, but I don’t give a shit. I’m clean and sober from H and that’s what is most important to me. I still go to meetings, I still talk with all the friends I made during rehab, shit, I still go back to my rehab to take guys to meetings and hang out with them cause I left on great terms, so I’m more than welcome to stop by, have lunch/dinner and hang out with the guys and watch TV/movies whenever.  All the staff respected me and I showed the respect back while in the program, and I go back every Monday during their mandatory Monday recovery meeting and speak to the new guys to give them encouragement to stick around in the program and just take it one day at a time.  

Again, sorry to ramble on and on, but I needed to get that off my mind.  If anyone here needs some advice on how to start, feel free to comment or message me.

Well our regular guy was hospitalized / flu - not drug related 
So we ended up getting some “scramble” to hold us over - for those of you unfamiliar with the Baltimore dope scene they sell 10$ gel caps full of super cut dope 
Problem whith this is that qualtitl is wildly different 

So we split a 10$ cap and I went to the bathroom - when I come back - she is blue/grey lips are purple - white foam coming out of her mouth and  breathing 

I grabbed a 4mg nasal ahotnof naloxone -  never used it so wasn’t even sure if I did it right 
4 min nothing 
Grabbed 2nf one 3.5 minutes still nothing   -  grabbed phone to call 911 but before I could dial she piped up and yelled at me for waking her up 

Then she wrn out again -  for another min or two - and woke up again before I could call 

Now she’s very sick 

I’m done with this terrible drug

But as a avid strong hash smoker for years opium have always interessted me. I dont do any drugs other than smoking Cannabis, but i have tried eating opiate painkillers once from the hospital (friend broke his arm and got Tramadol). Would that feeling be anything close? 


Can you describe the feeling it gets you, and where you did smoke it? (Im **not** asking where to BUY it and i also DONT want to buy it, i simply want to know what countries its ""still around"")


I know some Iranians have love for opium and it seems its still pretty strong userbase but ive never crossed path with opium in my life, it feels like something really ancient thats why im fascinated on where you have found it. It feels like most users are old people in villages in some SEA countries and Iran. 


To end the post i will say when i tried eating like 100mg of Tramadol 8 years ago, to this day ill never forget that feeling, probably one of the best feelings i ever had, but thats exactly why i never tried it again. And yes i know how low of a dose that probably is but with zero tolerance i felt it alot.

Hydtocidone was never really a problem. I would Take 15-20 mg an average of 3 to 4 times a week, one time a day. At that dose and frequency I never really developed much of a tolerance over six years. Then came the schedule change and it became much harder to get (I don't have health insurance) so a girlfriend of mine “helped me out “and provided oxycodone and OxyContin which I had never tried before. Boy oh boy  my brain responded completely different to that. I did not like how it felt as much but it did what he needed to however within a year  I was taking 300 mg at a time. I knew that this was not a good idea and I know that I have to be on something long-term for pain management so I went into a methadone clinic to see if I could decrease my tolerance and manage pain at the same time. 
Nobody in my family knows I’m going to methadone clinic ... It has been a secret I guess you could say and it’s not easy to live with considering I have to go down there every damn day what, But it’s definitely helped. I started the beginning of October 2017, went up to 50 mg and then started tapering the first of the year to 5mg February 20th and took my last dose seven days ago. I had some stomach upset for the last two weeks but that’s been the only real side effect I’ve had it’s been pretty much controlled with loperamide. My question is I am having surgery March 26 and my plastic surgeon does not know anything about the methadone and I don’t know how to approach this... or should I say, he WONT be knowing about the methadone..  will regular opiates work for me again ? Will they have the same effects? Will they manage pain? I tried to bring up the idea of coming off the methadone to the staff at the clinic and they fought me the entire way.The staff at the methadone clinic will not listen to me, they keep trying to keep me there for “at least two years “. Fuck that! I am not doing that for two years, I feel at this point they are trying to just make money and I’m not having it. I have had no negative side effects coming down except for that upset stomach for last two weeks and at this point I’ve been off of the hydrocodone and oxys for almost 6 months. I’m confident that that tolerance level should have dropped so that after being off this methadone I can go back to using just hydrocodone again and never text Oxy‘s because that clearly did not mix well with my brain chemistry. 
 So... I guess what I’m asking is how long after you stop taking methadone does it take for your body to be responsive to regular opiates again? Will it be safe by my surgery March 26?",1519734059.0

80knm6,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/80knm6/cliffs_previous_understudy/,4,https://redd.it/80knm6,sloan_fitch,Cliff's Previous Understudy,"Let me introduce you to Cliff's previous understudy, we'll call him Ian. Years and years ago Ian was on the scene back when everyone used to hang out at Cliff's house to drink blunts and smoke beers. I didn't realize how wholesome our activities were back then in contrast to present day. One time I showed Roberto (the guy renting a room in Cliff's house) a fresh ounce of weed quality. Roberto quietly went to tell Cliff. In an outburst of celebration Cliff picked up a couch and flipped it over, and tumbled the pantry. This was before he had major back problems, I suppose.



Cliff's mom was tight, she stomped on the floor, almost came down stairs. Yeah, when we used to get loud she'd stomp on the floor. One time antoher friend said it was morse code, said ""I'll ask how she is"", he stomped, she stomped back and he said, ""she says she's fine.""


Anyway, back then Cliff started getting his oxy script and he once remarked ""this shit is legal heroin."" It would be another seven years or so before he started doing dope. I believe he was actually doing pills years before he made the afformentioned remark.


&nbsp;


Anyway, as the partying crew widdled down and faces changed it eventually came down to it being a rotation of myself, Cliff and Ian hanging out smoking blunts togeter. At one point Cliff spent over a year on methadone, then at some point he started snorting oxy's again but justfied it by saying ""It's the same shit just hits you in 40 seconds instead of 40 minutes.""


Ian would coming through to do pills on occasion by that point in time about five years ago. Once in a while they'd beg me come through with a blunt because they were between re-ups for pills. I didn't truly understand why back then but whatever. Sometimes I'd be hanging out at another friend's house with no idea when I'd be back in our neighborhood. I was almost as bad as the worst dboys when it came to my ETAs. 

&nbsp;

I remember Ian would talk about getting Suboxone to Cliff and I'd just be like, ""stupid pill poppers, Ian is so obsessed with getting Suboxone for some reason."" I don't know if Ian was usually procuring subs on his own or if he depended on Cliff to help get subs. I do know that Ian never took less than half of an 8mg sub, or never took less than 4mg. 

Speaking of driving, Ian would get paid in pills for driving Cliff to the doctor and pharmacy. It worked for a while.

&nbsp;


About around two years ago Ian started acting oddly and or moochfully. He'd come to hang with Cliff to do pills and be like ""I left my pills at home"", a lot of the time. Then he'd earn some pills on occasion but he started making outrageous requests.


For example, Ian once called Cliff on the phone and said, ""Do you need five bottles of soda?"" His asking price was something like 5 roxy 15mg for 5 2-liter bottles. Now maybe at medicaid prices this makes sense but at fair market value this is pretty insane and disproportionate. 


It just wasn't worth it, even for two bottles of soda Ian wanted two roxies. Sidenote, I can get 1 roxy for two 2-liter bottles which is still worth more but my biking counts as labor just as gas would count if Ian earned one pill for two bottles of soda.


&nbsp;


Towards the end Ian was supplimenting his dope with xannies/benzos. He was snorting lines of footballs every single day. When he had dope, and when he didn't have dope. Oh yeah, I almost forgot about that. I think Ian was the one who got Cliff to transition to dobut we all know it's basicall the same anyway. Ian started dating a substance abuse councilor and one day came in all excited, ""I just got her to try it, to snort some xanax.""


&nbsp;

Good news, his girlfriend is not snorting xanax as far as I know nor is Ian. But anyway, there was this one night towards the end where Ian and his girl were sitting upright while falling asleep and Cliff couldn't get them to wake up to leave. This girl had a cigarette in her hand as she slept, and the ash was over two inches long. They eventually left but it is a fucking miracle they didn't crash their car. 

&nbsp;


Anyway, there was this one day where Cliff got a couple of Xanaxes from his mom for Ian. Ten minutes later Ian went to Cliff's mom to ask for two more xannies. He claimed that Cliff never gave him the first two and that he took them for himself. Cliff's mom didn't want to argue so she just gave him two more but later on Cliff and her spoke about it and this is one time where I know Cliff wasn't lying. That was the final week in which Ian hung out at Cliff's. Don't get me wrong, such lies are well within Cliff's capacity. If Ian wasn't railing so many benzos, I might've questioned the validity of Cliff's side of this story.


Sidenote, to present day: a couple of months ago Cliff's sister was bugging out accusing Cliff of stealing some pills she dropped on the floor. In his anger and furstration he punched the wall making a small hole in the wall.

A few months earlier, Cliff's sister did indeed drop a bottle of perc 10's on the floor and Cliff totally did take them and keep them for himself.


&nbsp;

Back in time again to when Ian used to hang out with Cliff...

They went to the donut shoppe to get pills but Cliff told Ian to stay in the car because he was all fucked up. Ian came in anyway and while they were waiting on line for donuts or coffee Ian asked the pill connect if he could get a couple of blues to rip in the bathroom. 


Ian was told to GTFO. Right after that, the pill connect only wanted to sell Cliff his pills but Cliff was like ""if I don't buy Ian's pills now I'll be in a bad position because he'll want me to share out of my supply."" So the pill connect allowed him to procure on Ian's behalf one last time but he never wanted to see or do business with Ian again.


&nbsp;

Ian had scars on his wrist on the last few days. That week his mom caught him preparing a bag of heroin in his room to snort. No wait, I think he prepped a bag and fell asleep with a line on his desk. Some fucking nightmarish shit like that. Between that and running out of Xanax I believe he was plunged into deep depression.


Shortly therafter he stopped hanging with Cliff, got professional help and hopefully stopped negatively influencing his girlfriend, who happens to be a substance abuse councilor. 

&nbsp;


Rumor has it that Ian was going around saying Cliff was a bad influence getitng him to do all kinds of bad shit, but in my observation Ian was quite culpable. Just as I can't completely blame Cliff for getting me into this shit. I had a right to decline that first bump.


Speaking of, I belive that Cliff ofered me that first bump about a month or two before Ian stopped hanging out with him. Almost seems like he had an idea of what was to come, that things were getting unstable with Ian. Maybe he wanted to get me into opiates in time to help him procure. Maybe it's just a coincidence. It was at least three months of me getting two roxy 15's every two weeks before I got in deeper, before I'd say ""can I buy an extra pill"" and before I started chipping dope which came before me joining up to order a bundle of drope here and there.


Of course I quietly escalated from, puking because I did three bags in a short span of time to barely feeling it. 

&nbsp;


Ian's last use of opiates was nearly two years ago, a little after the time in which I started. He started getting too sketchy for Cliff's taste, if you could believe that and this sketchyness outweighed the benefits of having a driver for doctors appoinments and procurement of dope.",1519717290.0

I found some of the posts a bit ambiguous:

1) Do NOT take benzos + Suboxone without a fair tolerance to *Suboxone*. I wouldn't fuck with benzos/suboxone until at least several weeks in. 

Start slow. Take a 0.5mg alprazolam with your standard Suboxone dose. Set aside one or two more, wait an hour or two, and try to judge your capacity for taking more. Sometimes a friend can provide much better insight than you can. If you're nodding the fuck out, that's time to stop and be concerned. 

2) If you plan on doing this, accept the fact (however unrealistic) that you may die. Be safe, keep someone informed as to what you're doing, or go for a walk around town while the benzos are kicking in. If you collapse in public, it's better than passing out in your room.

3) Benzo Sidenote: If you are a compulsive benzo redoser, do your best to separate your stash from being immediately available. Leave the benzos at work in your desk. At a friend's house. Stash 'em well at a family's house. If you're stashing at home, make it difficult to access: I personally No Country For Old Men it by taking a ziploc bag, unspooling a wire coat hanger, taping the bag to the end of the coat hanger-wire, unscrewing a ceiling vent, and then stuffing it in there. It will impede your efforts a bit, but if you're anything like me, you'll be wobbling on a stool spending 60 minutes unscrewing vents in your house looking for your stash. Another option is getting stoned/benzoed out of your mind and putting them in some bullshit, stupid impossible-to-locate area; this may impede your ability to find them... for at least a few days.

4) If you're flush with cash, preemptively make the good (yet insane) decision to dispose of at least some of your supply. I purchase in bulk for a very decent price so I feel I can justify this, sometimes. This is hard to do and something that pretty well indicates you have a serious drug problem ime. 

5) Banal ""Wisdom"": Try to use the benzos productively. I typically use them to jump a milligram or two down from my Suboxone dose and then wait several months before indulging again.

6) Don't dose higher than your typical Suboxone dose when using the benzos. Don't play with fire, you have one life, however shitty it is - and fuck life can get nightmarishly shitty - YOU can create amazing things and affect people's lives. You can create beautiful art that no one sees but provides such an internal sense of satisfaction and pride that it propels you into a much more peaceful life. You do not need skill to do this, you only need a long-term commitment to exploring a way to express yourself. You may find meaning in helping other people - you've been through some shit, and if you can get *your* shit together, there's nothing more powerful than deeply affecting someone else's life in a positive way. Working for charity, support groups, hell, even the way you talk to a cashier - you are a beautiful person with capacity for incredible love, living a life where you enrich other people around you and find joy and contentedness within yourself.

Abstract

W-18 (1-(4-Nitrophenylethyl)piperidylidene-2-(4-chlorophenyl)sulfonamide) and W-15 (4-chloro-N-[1-(2-phenylethyl)-2-piperidinylidene]-benzenesulfonamide) represent two emerging drugs of abuse chemically related to the potent opioid agonist fentanyl (N-(1-(2-phenylethyl)-4-piperidinyl)-N-phenylpropanamide). Here we describe the comprehensive pharmacological profiles of W-18 and W-15. Although W-18 and W-15 have been described as having potent anti-nociceptive activity and are presumed to interact with opioid receptors, we found them to be without detectible opioid activity at ?, ?, ? and nociception opioid receptors in a variety of assays. We also tested W-18 and W-15 for activity as allosteric modulators at opioid receptors and found them devoid of significant positive or negative allosteric modulatory activity. Comprehensive profiling at essentially all the druggable G-protein coupled receptors in the human genome using the PRESTO-Tango platform revealed no significant activity. In silico predictions using the Similarity Ensemble Approach suggested activity for W-18 only weakly at H3-histamine receptors, which was not confirmed in radioligand binding studies. Weak activity at the sigma receptors and the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor were found for W-18 (Ki=271 nM); W-15 displayed weak antagonist activity at 5-HT2-family serotonin receptors. W-18 is extensively metabolized, but its metabolites also lack opioid activity. W-18 and W-15 did inhibit hERG binding suggesting possible cardiovascular side-effects with high doses. Thus although W-18 and W-15 have been suggested to be potent opioid agonists, our results reveal no significant activity at these or other known targets for psychoactive drugs.

Apparently they are totally devoid of any effect nor analgesic nor sedative nor euphoriant, read the paper for more info (its not a big paper you can read it really fastly)
This led law enforcement officials, Health Canada and the media to initially–and mistakenly–describe the drug as an opioid. But the comparison to morphine in the patent was made in a relatively non-specific mouse model of pain where other classes of pain relievers (analgesics) and unrelated drugs show effectiveness. The drug has never been evaluated in humans.

The then-graduate student who made the compounds told me in April that he and the two other inventors had never tested the chemicals as opioids and had only preliminary evidence that the painkilling effects could be reversed by the opioid antagonist naloxone (Narcan; Adapt Pharma). But no further work on W-18 or its relatives was published by the inventors or other researchers since the patent.

Best joke of the years, they could had waited the 1st april, But i don't understand why the team who Publied the first paper on those compound hasn't said anything since some decade.

 Edit: I see the article date from 2016 and nobody noticed that until i found this totally by hazard.

So a few days ago i had to be in court realy early. It was just a quick araignment so it only took like 5 minutes but i had to wait forever. I figured id pop some valley for court so i took 20mg since i have no toleranc. I was nice and buzzed at court. Also i got barely any sleep the last few day so i was already pretty exhausted. Anyways, i go to court and, and im falling asleep. I get called up the judge, and he says his spchpiel, gives me a sly remark, and i leave. I head over to get this one dude to pick him up, then we go get our middle. Everything is going well enough and we copped. We drop off the middle and head back to my buddies place to drop him off. Shortly after copping we did some small bumps so we were buzzed on the way back. Not nodding out mind you, like, just mild buzz...good to drive. On the way back we stop to get gas and snacks. At the gas station my buddy offers to drive while i sit shotty. And its at this point i completely passed out. We got to where he was going to get dropped off but he stayed with me to make sure i didnt die. My breathing was wonky but my skin color was fine and my heart rate was slow but strong according to him. Dudes a fuckin trooper. And ty again if you read this. Also i live an hour away 1 way from him so to get him he throws me gas money a tiny bit of dope and some extra cash. Dudes seriously cool. Also he ledt 30 bucks while i was out somewhere in my car but i cant find it now. Im hoping in a few weeks when im desperate for a jj moment ill find it. But yeah thats how i fell out. I figured it was a mix of sleep deprivation, diazepam, and the dope....wich was pretty fuego. So now im wothout dope, a car, and the sickness is kicking in. Thank the lord i have a bunch of adderall and some diazepam. 




Ps what would help the addy and diazepam with sickness besides kratom or lope? Oh yeah and i have a bunch of cottons for tomorrow thatll hopefully last me a few days.

I invite you to my next pain management appointment, and my struggle on trying to get my prescriptions filled.. I challenge you to be fair, and come do a report of the other ugly side of this crisis ...

I am a 46 year old woman, who was given the flu shot 3 years ago and became paralyzed. I spent 45 days hospitalized and was diagnosed with Guillian Barré Syndrome and Parsonage Turner Syndrome. The pain was excruciating and cruel. My doctors told me next to burns, Parsonage Turner syndrome is one of the most severe and painful conditions a human being can suffer through. The doctors had slowly started me on iv pain meds, but nothing worked. Eventually they were able to get me to a functioning pain level with fentanyl 50 mcg patch and 8 mg of oral Dilaudin every 4-6 hours. Since then, I have developed severe autoimmune diseases and I am completely disabled. I still take the same exact medication I took in 2014. I’ve never abused them. My doses have never increased. I’ve done pt and ot (inpatient and outpatient), lidocaine patches, muscle relaxers,’etc .. you name it.. I’ve done it. I, like the millions like me who suffer from chronic pain, do NOT WANT TO TAKE THE MEDICATIONS!! Nor do we want to be treated like pariahs and addicts / junkies. Every time “journalist” report on ONE side of this “epidemic”, it only causes the real chronic pain patients more suffering. Maybe spend the day with a pain patient? Come with me. I challenge you. Go to my appointment. Go to the pharmacy with me. See how I have to get random pill counts , drive 4 hours to a pain management doctor because NO pain management doctors where I live will treat patients anymore (are we still in America?). Please, Come along. Listen to my arguments With my insurance company. Watch me have
To leave my belongings with the front office while I urinate in a cup and get blood drawn, so I can prove I take my medications. Watch me get questioned and humiliated as to why I need the medications on day 30, 2 hours before my last fill/pickup..(So if I picked up my medications on March 1, 2018 at 12:00 pm, I have to wait until April 1, 2018 at 11:30 am to get my next prescription). Oh, and did I mention I can’t drive?? It’s part of my disability. So I depend on others. So what happens if the pharmacy doesn’t have Dilaudin or fentanyl in stock? They say “sorry, you can try another pharmacy or go to emergency room”.. but, if I do that, well, then I am a “drug seeker”.. so instead, I suffer and cry and scream in agony until we can get my medications filled. Imagine if they told a diabetic “sorry, no insulin “ or a heart patient “sorry, we don’t have it” and that patient can’t go to work or function, or worse, need to be hospitalized?? 
So again , please.. come with me.. I invite you to see the other side of this “epidemic “.. did you know, on average there are 24
suicides and heart attacks a day directly related to pain patients losing their pain medications? It’s cruel. It’s inhumane. It’s torture. It’s wrong. It’s pure discrimination against people that are disabled and their symptoms cannot be treated.. 

So , anytime, I welcome you.. my pain management appointments are in Miami, but I live in Tampa. My next appointment is March 22. I look forward to hearing from someone from & Seeing a report of the other side of this crisis.

As the tittle says, I need advice and will try to make it short.

I am a random guy from a very small city where opioids are pretty rare (unless for people with chronic pain and old people I guess ^^). Last weekend an old  friend of mine came to visit me for a couple days and left here what it must be 0.3 g of H (he didnt want to risk taking it to the aeroplane) It s a hard rock that looks very close to [this](https://i.redd.it/v8su03v8oxi01.jpg) but a bit darke. Photo from /u/dopenpizza 

After thinking those last days I came up with the idea that I will try It in about two weeks (I want to analyze it first, scare as FUCK of fentanyl..., I have 0 tolerance to opioids, dont want to die If you ask me), my plan is to make a line and inmediately throw away the rest of it. Why?, stupid question I guess. Well... even tho I am a responsable guy you can say, I know H is a Hell for a reason, and people dont decide to get hooked.

To add some background, I smoke weed daily when the day is done and have been taking cocaine 3-4 times/year for the last +10 years. Addicted to coffee and coca-cola hoolly sht!

 That said,  the questions are... 

- How much should be the dose? I am small guy (60 kg). And I dont want to be nodding out. I will be alone so for that reason, and some others, I just want to ""feel"" the high a bit, no need to last for along 2 hours. Some short of ""therapeutical dose"" might be enough.

- What can I actually expect from the first time? Will I actually feel ""sick""?

- Is it true I might throw up?, should I eat before or should I do it with an empty stomach? 

If someone can ask me those questions I would be very grateful.

Also sorry no good englando.....

Edit: Thank you for your response guys, I really appreciate it. As I haven´t anyone to be with me and would never ask any friend of mine... (it was going to be one of those little secrets that you dont ever share with anyone....) I just threw it away and holy shit I realized how much I was thinking about it the last days debating either doing it or not... I took very serious your advice and I ll stay far from it, because holy shit it actually seems stronger than what I could imagine based on your comments.

Still buy oxynorm every now and then once I feel the suboxone has unloaded from the receptors 

Source of oxynorms have officially come to an end, not really fussed but considering this will be my last weeks access to them I’d like to IV

Just wondering what the best type of needle / gauge etc is needed , I’m a complete noob to self administered IV, I’ve tried pure H from the dark web administered by experienced junkies and it was pretty neat. That was a year ago, haven’t had a needle since

Appreciate warnings but I’m not interested in them, could I please get a clear cut ‘how to’ on getting these bad boys in my veins?

Oxynorm is Australian exclusive (ironically) it’s basically pure Percocet without the paracetamol or other NSAIDs. Comes in gel capsule which can be easily removed to reveal precious white powder. Great for snorting but getting 5x 20mg up there isn’t pleasant.

Of course there would be fillers in the powder but I’m assuming there’s ways to filter them out. If not who cares it’s one maybe 2 shots, only 100mg left I want to use.

Checking out the size of the area I stroll through about 10 or so waist high plants and when I get to the end I see a plant all to familiar despite never having even seen them in real life - only in movies and documentaries. Certainly look like poppy plants to me - although I know there’s a ton of different species and really only one worth fucking with... I tend to gamble that this is the one worth fucking with as they are planted only about 10 - 15 meters from another drug crop! (the weed). Checking some of the pods and there are score marks on some if not most of them. Couldn’t see any red flower petals though which I though was supposed to be on them as well..

Is it just a scam to take money? I think the most frustrating part of this is the fact we are sending so much money to other countries (whether it's a scam or not) it's a piece of the opioid epidemic that probably hasn't been factored. It's money we could keep inside the US if we used more harm reduction methods like giving people Rx Heroin and a set amount or structuring controlled use with an emphasis on treatment and access to treatment. Other Countries are getting rich because we can't legislate common sense drug reform.

I realize opiates are probably worse in the long run than what I'm used to (Pot, E, Acid, occasionally Xanax) but I'm curious.

My question is, if I was to take somewhere between 15-25 mg, would I be at a whole lot of risk for wanting more? I've been getting high for around 3-4 years now, and I've always been good about spacing anything but weed out by a month at the absolute minimum (Most of the time, 2-3 months). However, I have zero interest in addiction and if experienced users feel like, even with a good track record with other drugs, I shouldn't even bother dabbling in it, I don't think I will.

I'm not here for those objections but I understand why you feel the need to warn against it. But please don't judge me.

I've been using large doses of codeine for 4 years, and tried other stuff like oxy. I've been using heroin for 2 years. I didn't even consider trying to IV it until recently. 

The way I use it is I dissolve (china white #4) in water, draw into a 1ml syringe, and rectally administer it. It works great but I don't think it's the most cost effective method. 

I recently bought 0.1G for $70 and used it in one day, without much tolerance. Maybe this is normal, and maybe it wasn't as pure as advertised. 

Usually 0.2G lasts me a few days even with a higher tolerance, but I usually don't get as high as when I had the 0.1G in one day.

Where I live there are needle and syringe programs where you get 5 syringes/needles for $5 from certain pharmacies and other organizations, and there are also safe injecting rooms. 

I've read all the safe injection guides I can. My list of supplies is as follows:

- syringes and needles 
- alcohol wipes
- cotton buds / cotton balls (not sure where to get micron filters)
- sterile water (hopefully saline, otherwise tap water boiled for 5 minutes)
- soap for washing hands / hand sanitizer
- small sterile cup for mixing H with water 
- elastic tourniquet (my leggings seem to work pretty well)

For those that are experienced with self injection:

Is there anything else I should do to prepare? 

Any supplies missing from my list, or anything I got wrong?

Any tips for first time injecting?

I've practiced finding a vein, and I will be doing a lot more of that when I study nursing next year. I can sort of feel a vein with the tourniquet on. And I've watched nurses and pathologists do it many times. I still have scars where needles have gone in because I get a lot of blood tests and have been to hospital a lot. 

Any tips for finding a vein and inserting the needle not too shallow and not too deep?

But no it really isn't. 

We were moving yesterday before I had to work and stress was high among everyone and fights insued along with carelessness. Both of my dogs and all the cats were in the car freely they don't travel in pet carriers as they've all been riding in cars since babies and know the drill. But, between bickering someone managed to open a car door and not close it. And I'm sure we all know how this ends... the dogs stayed because they're obviously good boys and girls. 

The area was frequently checked yesterday for any sign of kitties with zero luck. I took a food bowl and some of my stuff they laid on to the area in hopes they'll catch my scent and stay around. I've been so upset over this. This subreddit knows how much my animals mean to me. 

The shittiest part is I haven't been using as much, just don't feel the urge to. Mentally I feel meh sober but physically I feel way better sober so I have been going with the flow. Secretly excited that I'd have all this extra money to blow and planning on spoiling my animals. They have been my rocks through so much and I've always felt guilty doing drugs and risking them losing me. They were the only things that kept me going and wanting better and now they're gone and may never see me again. They're alone, cold, wet, and roaming woods they've never even seen much less roamed! 

First thing this morning I went roaming and looking for them and got extremely happy when I saw the flicker of white and movement in the distance. Out came running my most important cat, shh can't have favorites but she is mine. Crying and running full speed until she reached me. So I've at least managed to get one back. 

Shit just sucks. Sober and animal less when I was staying high with a big happy fur family. I see you karma. ",1519934147.0

8181hb,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8181hb/zohydro_30mg_vs_oxycontin_op_20mg/,7,https://redd.it/8181hb,FrankingHydePierce,Zohydro 30mg vs Oxycontin OP 20mg?,"I've been on Zohydro 30mg, twice a day, for over a year.  Excellent drug.  Helps me with my chronic pain.

I get the Zohydro through a mail-order company and it only costs $20 per script.  Dirt-cheap.  The mail order company will ONLY ship it to the state in which the script was written.  So when I travel, If I use the mail order company, I cannot have the drug delivered to the place I am located.   If I instead take the physical script to pharmacies at my travel location, every place I take my Zohydro script wants at least $600 to fill the prescription!  I cant afford $600 a month, so when I travel, I need a different opiate ER drug...

A few days ago my pain doctor offered me Oxycontin OP 20mg, twice a day, for situations when I need to fill the script out of state.  I took the prescription to several pharmacies to get prices, and the average price was about $240...much better than spending $600 on Zohydro.

So my questions:

- Would you prefer to take Zohydro 30mg twice a day or Oxycontin OP 20mg twice a day, assuming both are the same price?
- Would you prefer to take Zohydro 30mg twice a day or Oxycontin OP 20mg twice a day assuming the Zohydro costs $600 a month, and the Oxycontin OP costs $200 a month?
- Which of these two medications is easier to ""modify"" so the drug effects your system at a faster rate?  (ed. I have never snorted, plugged, or IVed my meds, and I hope I never will.  The worst I do is dissolve them in soda or crush them and put them in soda.)

After a few days of experimenting with the Zohydro 30mg and the Oxycontin OP 20mg, I made some quick observations:
- The first time I took the Oxycontin OP 20mg, it hit me like a ton of bricks.  Fantastic pain relief.  Pain relief lasted for 10+ hours.  Took 12 hours before withdrawal effects started.
- Took Oxycontin OP 20mg a second time.  This time, the drug wasnt nearly as effective, lasted about two hours, and a mere four hours later, I was feeling withdrawal effects!  I couldnt believe it.

IMO, if seems like the Zohydro 30mg gives a more consistent pain relief.  The Oxycontin is a bit of a wildcard.  It can give you serious pain-relief for a good amount of time, or it could be a complete dud, which throws you into unexpected withdrawals.  Does this sound like how Zohydro and Oxycontin typically treat users?

Through my limited experience with oxycontin op 20, and my more extensive experience with Zohydro 30, I am leaning towards going back to the Zohydro.  Not knowing when I may go into W/Ds by using OxyContin OP 20mg is a deal-breaker for me.  Unless I can find a way to make the Oxycontin OP 20mg more consistent, the Zohydros are gonna win this battle.",1519933148.0

To which I respond, ""I was planning on getting around to it eventually but **I didn't see the point in hurrying up and waiting.""**


I came by for a couple of hours to watch SVU and Waco with Cliff. Not much conversing went down since he was knocked out by his benzos. I didn't pick up his Xanax script today because of the afformentioned reason.


&nbsp;

Cliff wheezes in his breathing, like a looped accordion recording. He fades in and out of sleep, I wake him up for the occasional key scene from the SVU episode.


His mom inquires from the other room, ""are you sleeping?"" Minutes earlier he told his mom that he was expecting his bookie to come through, I guess he's lying about his next earning money. His mom asked if he was going out but also said not to go out if he wasn't feeling well. I believe she was expecting him to go out and conduct some business today. If he was, all bets went out the window after he picked up the benzos.


&nbsp;


Then she asked about the car, ""did you speak to him about what's going on with the car?"" 


The car lie has been going on for months. For fucking months **he pretended that a friend was giving him a used Lexus** to be used for running errands and other responsible adult shit. At one point he borrowed a friend's car for a couple of doctor's appointments and pretended it was his own car. Of course the person who loaned the car received some pills from Cliff's mom's roxy script.



Eventually he claimed the car was parked around the block and that it was just 
too difficult to walk around the block for a week or two. Then he **pretended that the car was taken back** by the person who gave him the **imaginary car** to get some **imaginary repairs** done. Now, any related questions are met with deflections.

&nbsp; 


I didn't even talk about the beautiful weather, how I went out to ride my bike and break-in some new parts. Oh well, I did write about that in the longer version of this post but that shit was really long. This is the short version, in which the most entertaining points were retained.

&nbsp;


The only two lessons I can think of:


* It's good not being dependent on the word of Cliff and his faulty supply chain to stay well. The benzo enthusiast from around the block was supposed to trade with him at 6pm but the trade never happened, as I expected.


Cliff wants to get subs tomorrow, maybe I'll help him procure them if he throws me a free sub or two and shows me the money. Either way I'm not telling him about nor am I sharing my personal stash.



* The second lesson is, I think Cliff really should use that weird loop-straw contraption when snorting his dope and pills. I think that would allow his lungs to operate more reliably.


I'm not exactly sure what the best way to load that loop-straw blow-snort apparatus is. I have a couple of ideas, such as crushing a pill inside the tube but loading dope.. it's difficult to do with a narrower straw. Bleh, I don't have dope anyway.


Anyway, I'm glad I spent today sleeping in late, working on my own projects, listening to an audiobook and getting my ten miles cylcing.

As a final side note, I think I want to stop doing dope for one odd reason.... every other time I binge on dope my eyes get itchy, I rub them and the part below my eyes gets red and dry for a couple of days.",1519889543.0

81nf3g,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/81nf3g/am_i_the_worst_long/,22,https://redd.it/81nf3g,AbiNormL,Am I the worst? (Long),"So about 8 years ago about a year after I started using I agreed to go to an outpatient group twice a week to please my family and I met this guy that I’ll call Mark, who introduced to me to first solid dope connect. Mark and I became pretty good friends over the years. I knew he had a brother but I’d only met him a couple times and never really paid him much attention. Fast forward to last summer and I pull up to Marks house after getting high and hanging out with him to see his brother standing outside. The sun was just starting to set and as I got out of the car his brother, who I’ll refer to as Keith, smiled at me with the most beautiful teeth (I’m a sucker for a gorgeous smile) and these crystal blue eyes, the sun hit him just right and it was like seeing my dream man fabricated right before my eyes. Perfect height (I’m 4’ 9” he’s 5’7”), blue eyes, light hair, amazing smile, sculpted body (he was a personal trainer at one time). He had a job, a place to stay, and seemed like everything I was looking for in a man. Also, like me, a heroin addict.

We spent every day together for the next 3 weeks getting high and hanging out, although it never got sexual even though I desperately wanted it to, until disaster struck. We were both on probation, him for OUI for nodding off at the wheel and crashing and me for possession, Class A. Neither of us had been on top of our stipulations such as passing drug tests and his probation officer issued a warrant for his arrest. As they were taking him away I wrapped my fingers around the fenced in window of the cruiser and told him I loved him. And I meant it. His eyes nearly exploded from his head. He spent the weekend in county and when I went to court on Monday to see him I found out I too had a warrant. Not being the first time I figured I’d see the judge and get a new date. Boy was I wrong. I end up being detained and next thing I know I’m sitting across from this man in my own cage in the basement of the court house. I go back in front of the judge after trying and failing to prove my sobriety with another drug screen and I am told I will be detained for 30 days in county until my next court date. Cue me loosing my fucking mind. I’ve never been to jail. Ever. 

They bring me back down to the basement lock up and in hysterics I tell Keith that I’m sorry and that I’ll see him in a month. We yelled back and forth to each other until I was taken away. Before I left I yelled to him that I loved him and from the other side of the room where I couldn’t even see his face, he yelled back that he loved me too. 

I spent the next 30 days kicking a $80/day heroin habit, 16mg/day suboxone, and 10mg/day xanax. Keith and I spoke every day. He always answered and talked to me for the whole half hour I was allowed. He put money on my books for canteen. We decided we would be together and that we would use the first day we hung out as our anniversary. Even though I was in jail I felt like one of the luckiest girls in the world. He was so kind to me. Made me feel so fucking special. No man had ever treated me this way. He even wrote me letters and sent me a picture to ease my heartache. I didn’t sleep more than a couple hours those first 30 days but he got me through it. I don’t know what I would have done in there without him. 

My court day finally came and I ended up being sentenced to 59 days for violations of probation. So I had 3 more weeks to spend before I could go home. I got some good time for getting a job on the unit before I was sentenced so I only served 52 days. 

Like I said we hadn’t slept together before I went away so I was really looking forward to it when I got out and it was worth the wait. I won’t go into detail but it was amazing. The first few weeks I was home were bliss. He was just as loving and attentive in person as he’d been on the phone. I’d never been happier. 

So obviously I had to fuck it up. 

Instead of taking the same offer they gave me of 59 day jail time he opted for an ankle bracelet, a breathalyser he has to do 3-4 times a day and 9 more months of probation including night drug classes twice a week and an $800 OUI class. He got clean and went on the vivitrol shot before I got out after I begged him to promising I would get on it too when I got out. 

I opted for another type of shot when I couldn’t get the vivitrol right away. My dope habit was right back to where it was before jail. Slowly over the last few months our relationship has changed. He’s not loving at attentive as he once was. We hardly have sex anymore and he seems disinterested in anything I say or do. I know it’s my own doing and I hate myself for it. 

At the end of next month he’ll be off probation and everything that’s come with it. I feel like a huge piece of shit because I know as soon as he has the ability to get high without having the courts breathing down his neck I know he will and I can’t fucking wait. I feel like once he starts getting high again our relationship will get better because he won’t resent me for getting high when he can’t. I know I’m a horrible person for feeling this way but I just want things to go back to the way they were. I miss the way he used to act toward me.

Title: My hope is fading

As I mentioned in a couple other post, something changed in me recently when i got off h onto subs. it was a very wierd wd process that took almost 10 days to actually start taking subs.

but anyways, life is great no urge for opiates at all. I don't miss them, i don't want them, I've been tested by people several times with no problems.

but I've been in a lot of pain over the last few days... how tf am I going to do this? I can't live my life in this pain. and I definitely can't work like this, which I start Monday.

I feel really down right now. I feel like i had this beautiful balloon floating above me and some one just came and popped it.

on top of the mental, and physical part, i have type 1 diabetes. every time I'm in pain like this my blood sugar goes into the 300's and 400's.

I know there is not really anything you guys can do. but thanks for listening.

I also can't fall back to sleep without getting a pain right behind my eyes(migraine?). On the weekends if i try to sleep past my normal awaking hour(which is 530-6am).

Like i can't even take a nap when i get home from work, because ill wake up with a pounding headache regardless of length of sleep(30mins+).

Its really starting to be an issue, my doctor is great, but is just passing it off. Though in his defense, my last visit was the first time i mentioned it to him.


This only really started to happen after i started weaning. I was at 16mg a day 2 years ago(and 4yrs prior), and now my current dose is 8mg a day(4mg twice a day, typically 6am and 4pm). I still had this issue

My tolerance has been pretty low since I got out. So I really miss the ritual of shooting up. I’m going to a friends in a little and I was thinking about shooting Up once before I head over there. 

To be on the safe side, my plan is to put a little ball the size of maybe a match head in there. Put it in about 20 cc’s of water and shoot that up in my arm. I plan on driving to the hospital and parking close to the door in case I end up OD’ing. 

I’ve eaten plenty today and have had stayed hydrated. Do you think my plan is safe? I’m paranoid about going right back to IV and reading some stuff but I know people have gone WAY BIGGER. This is gonna be a very small amount. 

Btw I know I’ve asked this question already but I erased any old posts. Just making sure I can make the best decision and I’m comfortable with what I decide. 

I mean I know my tolerance is low but I’ve heard of people shooting up half a G out of rehab. I’m literally talking about .1 or something. I know IV’ing is always dangerous but I don’t have to legitimately worry about a freakin OD, do I?

As I'm sure most of you know, fronts don't happen very often unless you're actually a ""friend"" of the dopeman or have some serious trust built. Hence, why I got so fucking lucky:

I've been waiting since yesterday for a loan from a friend, $100 cash. Still nothing. She claims her check didn't immediately go into her account because she had gone negative, and the bank told her she would have her money after midnight. 12:05 AM, NOTHING. 1:30 AM, STILL nothing. She's given up for the night. I'm fucked. Story of my fucking life.

I apologize for the somewhat irrelevant details, I promise there's a happy ending.

1:45 AM and I get a text from the dopeman to see if I'm still coming for a gram. I explain the unfortunate situation and assure them that I'll have money tomorrow if they could please keep my gram set aside until I can roll through.

""You got a whip?"" 
""Yes, for the rest of the night until about 5.""
""If you can give my homie a ride home, less than 2 miles from your place, I can front you a dub til morning. Cool?""
""Very fucking cool. On my way.""

After an anxiety filled drive, I'm sitting outside the apartment complex listening to Nirvana for about 30 minutes. Dopeman also happens to be a tweaker, so the waiting game is always unpredictable but inevitable. I can see them walking toward my boyfriend's mom's truck, which by some miracle she left us with the keys in case we were awake at 4 AM when his brother would get off of work. Dopeman approaches my window, and says ""we're straight on the dub for giving them a ride, you don't need to get me back, cool?"" Very fucking cool. Unexpected is a total understatement. Finally, I've got a guy and his girl in my backseat and a dub in my pocket. Fucking score. I can already feel my nerves calming down and the pain all over my body subsiding. I've been sick for 2 days, minus some slight relief thanks to a bottle of 50mg Tramadol. They definitely didn't get me high in any way, but they helped a bit. 

A little bonus on top of the free shit; I explain to the couple that who we just left was my only connection, as I just moved into town and don't know anyone. I explain that they've got great shit and the price is right, I just really wish I had the convenience of someone who can deliver since we don't always have access to the truck. The girl tells me that she's ""always on deck"", and will give me her number under the condition that I don't tell her friend that we just left from. Fucking score. Now when I finally get that cash tomorrow I'll have my gram delivered from only 2 minutes away. I guess I had some good karma built up because tonight feels like one giant miracle. I've never had such good luck.

I'm finally home. I can smell the dope through the plastic bag, pure vinegar. A rush of excitement hits me. Since my tolerance is slightly lower I don't mind that I have to split the dub between my boyfriend and I. I cook the shot and the smell hits me like a slap in the face. I'm feeling so much better already. I have to tie off both arms, as my veins are almost nonexistent and head to the bathroom where the lighting is much better and pray I can find something that resembles a vein. Looks like my middle finger is the winner. Less than 5 minutes of effort and I'm in. I release my tie-off and I plunge away. A sigh of sweet relief as my eyes close.

Now I'm on the patio having a cigarette, the first one I've enjoyed in days. Again, I apologize for the time wasting details, but I felt compelled to share tonight's story as my last post was horribly depressing and I can't believe I'm not sick anymore.

Thank you to anyone who took the time to read. I'm sure it wasn't as exciting as you'd hoped. Goodnight.

I bought some percs from a close friend and took them, but I absolutely hated the way they made me feel. Dizzy, light-headed, drowsy, etc. Fast forward a few months and I meet a guy in my class who is selling 40mg OC Oxycontin for FOUR DOLLARS A PILL. I found this too good to be true, so I bought one and swallowed it and I had the most euphoric experience of my life. This was strange to me because I hated percs, but I loved how Oxycontin made me feel. I've always been fascinated by drugs because my birth parents were both coke and heroin addicts. I was adopted at the age of 1 and I lived with my adoptive parents my entire childhood. 

After this fantastic experience, I started buying quite a bit of oxy. I would only do it once a week at first, but inevitably it progressed and soon I was doing it three times a week. I was snorting 80mg of oxy in the bathroom at my high school at least weekly, as well as doing it spread out throughout the week. However, I never let myself get physically addicted to it because I knew how bad the withdrawals would be. 

I believe that I started using out of curiosity, but also because I knew that it would help me cope with my mental disorders. I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder, social anxiety, as well as OCD. Of course opiates helped because they make you feel wrapped in a warm blanket free of troubles and worries. After a few months though, my plug got caught stealing these pills from his dad (fucked up, I know). So I stopped doing opiates regularly but my tolerance remained generally the same. Over the past four years I've taken a multitude of opioids but they've all been spread out. I am 18 now and I still have to rail at least 80mg to get an actual ""nod"". 

Thankfully, I've made it a point to not seek out opiates but I get incredibly intense cravings from time to time that send me into a deep depression. I feel as though, during these times, that opiates are the only thing will ever make me truly happy. I know that I shouldn't get back into them because they will fuck up everything in my life but when this feeling comes it stays for a long time. So now I come to the point of my post.

1. How do you deal with intense mental addiction to opiates?
2. Why do you think that I have such a naturally high tolerance to opiates? I've never felt any nausea from taking any opiate at any dose, even fentanyl. Even when I took an OC 40 for the first time all I felt was pure bliss.
3. Do you think I could constrain myself to doing it only monthly or so and not fall back into my habit? I did it once, but I don't know what would happen if I tried again.

How to know when you're ""in the clear""?","I'll begin this by saying I'm pretty sure I'm worrying for nothing lol-- I've been awake for going on 38+ hours now and that alone tends to trigger my PTSD symptoms something awful. Not to mention having a few other anxious situations happen over the day. Anyways I'll get to it...

I got a handful of oxycodone 30s last night. My tolerance always starts at 15mg every 4 hours or so unless of course I spent the previous day getting high as well. Anywho, I've been clean a good few months, so I started out this morning at 8:30 am with my 15mg. Usually I don't take more than 45mg in a twelve hour period. However the first dose didn't seem to give me much of a high so around 10 am I popped the second half, giving me a total of 30mg in my system. At 2:30, popped another 15mgs. Then around 6pm I had the second half of that, giving me a total 60mgs in my system between the hours of 8:30am until now (it's 10:35pm my time)

I can tell you that I have no idea why I decided to pop that last 15. I actually don't even remember the exact time when I did, though it wasn't any later than 6:30, of that I'm sure. I also only vaguely remember eating that last half, but I know I did.

I was doing alright up until around 8 pm when the nod-out effects began. Did some chores, had a mini-freak out over the discovery of a minor health issue with my dog, dealt with that accordingly, had a quick dinner and have been chilling in bed for about an hour.

I've had this happen a few times where I psyched myself out in thinking I might have overdosed, so I suppose I'm curious-- and obviously, definitely would like to know any important info about whether I may actually OD in the future-- to how I can figure out whether or not I should seek medical attention. A lot of it honestly is my lack of health insurance and the horrible stress it'd add to everything else if I had hospital bills to deal with as well.

I was reading through another post here (probably some ancient thread tbh) and a commenter said he wouldn't be able to write anything remotely coherent if he'd taken 'too much'-- and if he tried he'd nod out so much that one sentence would take him 45 minutes to finish lol. Hopefully this is coherent, and I've only had a couple moments where closing my eyes sounded suuuper great right now haha.

Anyways. I'll wrap this up by admitting that if I'm gonna fuck around with these meds, I can't *fuck around* with these meds, you know. I promise I'm not as foolish as my actions in regards to taking more than necessary today shows I am. If anything, y'all let me know whether that last sentence makes any damn sense at all? Haha.

Despite that I can't imagine never touching an opiate again so I want to get my tolerance back down to it's initial state and keep it there. 

I've got 30 mg of suboxone, kratom and ketamine on hand and also plan on getting a script for naltrexone. My plan is this:

Rapid taper with the subs over the course of a week and a bit until I can jump off without any withdrawal symptoms or only minor ones. After this start with the naltrexone at a low dose. I've read this can reset the brain to an almost opiate naive state. I'll continue this for a couple weeks after which I'll start chipping again. This time though I'm going to take small doses of ketamine or dxm on the days I'm doing dope.

Now here’s the catch. My car is a piece of shit and my mother took the license plate and keys as it’s registered to her, but she said I could sell it. I’m wondering if some person would come by, tow this Honda Civic and give me about $500 for it.


I also have a Xbox One I don’t use with Fortnite which she would notice, but I have like $450 in citi reward on amazon, could always order another. (Best part for Amazon route is I can get same day shipping). And of course blame Amazon for “doubleing” the citi rewards.


And third option is I purchased the newest Wireless Beats 3 from Amazon with the Citi card bonus points. If she doesn’t loan me today (which she might give me some money), I wanted to get at least 20 xans and 2 bundles or $240. I have $37 in my checking, $9.10 on my H&R Emerald Card (wish I knew how to transfer that to my bank), or I could just use the Emerald Card for two packs of Newport 100 with the remaining amount on my credit card.


If my mother didn’t get a text from every damn purchase I made with the credit card, I’d be buying 4 Dewalt drills and putting them on OfferUp. I also tried to get a cash advance with this credit card but I think there was a 4 digit pin to use it, and when you call the # on the back I think a username/number was required or some shit.


Edit: Still waiting on $92 from my states tax return, they quote


“Where's My (State) Personal Income Tax Refund?

So this sucks. Many options I don’t know what to do. What I really want is to get a car loan on my 21 weeks of unemployment left ($800 bi-weekly) and start riding Lyft, but I don’t know if the bank will let me do that.

but, this time is different. i think my downfall is steady supply and working enough to be able to abuse drugs at first. ive been in a good way for a while. a lot of steps forward, i actually have money saved and more importantly have my priorities in order. do i still procrastinate within those priorities? of course. hence the other side of the issue.

I've experimented with vicodin, liquid Vicodin, Tussionex (one of my favorites so far), lean, and oxy. However, I've never done more than 15mg oxy.

I finally managed to come across a decent supply of oxy, and I have enough to take a big dose if I want to. I have three ideas and I'd like some input on which is a better one:

Option 1: I take 3 of these 10/325 oxys on an empty stomach for a total of 30mg oxy

Option 2: I take 600mg Cimetidine (Tagamet) and then I take 2 of the 10/325 oxys for a total of 20mg oxy

Option 3: I take 600mg Cimetidine (Tagamet) and then 2.5 of of the 10/325 oxys for a total of 25mg oxy

I want to conserve the oxy, because I don't have a lot and I can't get more. That is why I am considering using the Cimetidine, because it is supposed to help potentiate the oxy and make it stronger.

The problem is, I don't know how much stronger. I feel like I've never *really* nodded out, and I've heard that a 30mg roxi could take me to that next level. So that's what I'm going for here, I just want the full experience.

823xs8,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/823xs8/bupetolerancedph_question/,1,https://redd.it/823xs8,AbanoR,Bupe/Tolerance/DPH question,"So I took my usual weekly hydrocodone and the usual potentiators (including DXM, Tagamet etc...), plus my IV benadryl. (I don’t need anyone telling me that that is dumb, I’ve heard it all already). 

IVing the Dph has in the past always created a more intense experience since it comes on so much quicker. I also crush and dissolve the hydro in water so it hits quicker as well. I usually do 50mg of dph though, this time I did 100mg. I’ve always enjoyed the sedation from that amount, even by itself though I don’t do that often. 

I didn’t get the feeling I had come to expect AT ALL and it was a dramatic change from previous experiences. I felt good for sure but it wasn’t anything like in the past, and I’d gotten pretty consistent results with my weekly ritual for at least a month and a half. Now, I have used some oxy I managed to get ahold of and extra lortabs over the past 2~3 weeks when normally I limit myself to Sunday night. I also took a sub yesterday at around noon (4mg). 

So my question is this, did I not get as high as I had come to expect:
1) Simply because of tolerance? Doing to much other stuff outside of my weekly indulgence? I wasn’t popping pills all day mind you, I just got high a few more times over those weeks than normal. Maybe two or three times a week. 

2) Because I took to much dph maybe? If there’s a sweet spot maybe I overshot it? I always figured that the more dph the stronger the opiate high but I guess there could be a point where it out muscles the opiates euphoria in favor of sedation. 

3) Or because the sub I took Saturday was still in my system and blocked some of the effects? I was told to wait 24-36 hours which I did but this still happened.  I took it several different ways only a small amount at a time because I was unfamiliar with it and because I just couldn’t seem to make the sublingual method work. 

It’s frustrating me because I have limited access to my DOC and not getting what I had come to expect is a real bummer. I know tolerance is a bitch, but I’m hoping y’all might be able to tell me if there is another reason, one that I could easily fix. Mind you, this wasn’t just a little less of a high, this almost felt like nothing and only lasted maybe an hour. My usual routine (which I’ll post below), used to have me floating on cloud nine and you’ll notice that it’s a little weaker than what I did tonight. 

30-45~ minutes prior to opiates
75mg hydroxizine pamoate
25mg diphenhydramine 
1000mg Tagamet
1 naproxen sodium
1 big swig of DXM
Big glass of grapefruit juice and tonic water

With opiates: 50mg of hydrocodone. 
25mg hydroxizine pamoate
50~mg diphenhydramine IV
200mg Tagamet
1000mg of calcium carbonate
1 big swig of DXM. 

Next time I think I’m gonna do this down to a T after a little tolerance break and compare results but for now I’d love some input on what might be the problem. ",1520230743.0

And dose for dose ratio it’s 1:1 hydrocodone:morphine oral, however morphine only has a bioavailability of *about* 30% orally? So technically 30mg of morphine should roughly be 10mg of hydrocodone? hydro’s bioavailability is roughly 87% quite like Oxycodone, however oxycodone is x1.67 stronger than Hydrocodone I believe according to equi-analgesia chart. 

So I’m theory considering strength and bioavailability it’d seems morphine is the weakest orally dosage wise of them all? Actually I’ve gotten higher off 100mg of oral morphine than I did 100mg Oral Oxycodone multiple times, and I find morphine extremely more euphoric, noddy yet energetic at the same time compared to Oxycodone.. Oxycodone is very social, it is sedating and can make me nod hard too, but I just find morphine superior which boggles me based on all the bad opinions on taking morphine Oral.. and I tried 3 times shooting morphine dissolved in my ass (not the gelled up brand) and didn’t feel anything really.",1520227497.0

But I gotta share a lil story cause I'm high rn and honestly didn't think it would happen today.
So let's back up. 
I lost my biggest flow of income recently and was not prepared. My girl and I are gonna be going into wds no matter what pretty much but damn dog I wanted to prepare a little.

 So day before yesterday I got a half on credit from my main dude but I know full well I can't pay his ass back.
I'm riding the bus home and I see this dude and I just know, (you know when you know), that he fucks with opiates.
Young black dude, thuggish, got one eye, big ass pores, but he's doing alright,  decent clothes jewelry. 
He's in the seat in front of me so I pull out my phone and lean over and call my banks automated system, 
it's a robot bish named Maggie and her only job in the world is to remind me how broke I am. 
So I say,""yo can you talk?"" That's all Maggie does is talk, ""press # for more options you broke ass mafk"", she says.
""Aight"", I say, ""you talk to Keisha?, well shit you better. Old boy paid in full for them fingers."" (Now I got the dude in front of me's attention. )
 ""Aight og"", I say and hang up. 
Few seconds later the dude leans over, ""ay I know you fuck with that food, make a nigga some money."" 
I was like ""bet, gimme yo number""
Flash forward to today and I'm sick af and after all day all I can manage to get up is $16 I'm like fuck... so I call old boy and a woman answers.
She says ""she's his ex and they ain't together anymore.""
I'm like fuck, so after awhile, like 3 hrs later I'm thinking fuck it, I'm gonna try to cold cop wit $16 and I start walking toward the cheapest gas station in the hood. 15mins in to walking I get a call and it's the dude, he called his ex asking if I called for him.
He was right down the street pulled up in 20 mins and sold me a twamp (.2) for $16.
It's fenty forsure but I'm not complain for how little I got, we ain't sick that's fosho.

A fun way to divert resources away from dope.,"#Note: Scroll down to the long horizontal line and bold text that says ""Start here"" if you don't want to read a whole bunch of background info to build up to the point of this post.

&nbsp;

Last two times I was at Cliff's house were a couple of days ago. The first was to watch SVU and Waco and that did generate my previous and most recent Cliffpost. Secondly was to help him buy subs. For once he actually wanted to buy subs in a timely manner but his sub connects suck or barely exist so of course I was requested to accomplish this mission through my contacts.


&nbsp;

My contact was originally going to come to me but due to rain and hunger they opted to go to the local fast food joint. It was pouring rain outside so the connect offered me one extra sub for biking over. Cliff paid for four subs and agreed to give me one. Of course I didn't tell him about the fifth free sub so I pocketed that as well. All-in-all, I did pretty well for myself.

&nbsp;

That night stuck around after delivery I stuck around Cliff's for all of thirty minutes. During that time we glossed over a couple of topics. For one, he shared a story about his attempted trade/transaction with our neighbors. One of them being the hardcore benzo enthusiast who wanted to trade three blues for many xannies. Cliff didn't want to trade, he proffered cash to buy a bundle of dope. The benzo enthusiast wanted $25 when he paid $20 and he felt that he deserved to make a little money off of each. With Cliff, he wanted two for $5 on the benzos when fair market value could easily reel in more cash per pill. 


Moff, the benzo enthusiast argued that Cliff didn't pay a lot for the benzos so he shouldn't charge as much. Okay fair enough, Moff always wants top dollar for shit but always wants to low ball. Just about every selfish actor in trade.

&nbsp;

Tom, not to be mistaken with Tim lives nearby as well and is often the middleman for Cliff. Tom is the one who ratted me out indirectly for doing dope. The true details are murky and will never be fully known but when I was told that my brother was coming over to ""talk about something very important"" on a particular Saturday, I had a hunch what it was about. Once I had a hunch on what it was about, it wasn't very hard to guess the source of the leak.


Months later, Tom apologized to me for being the source of the leak. He said, ""I was talking to my mom and my brother must've overheard...""


WTF, why the fuck does he think it's cool to talk about my dope habit and my need to purchase suboxone before a trip with his mom. He probably told his brother directly, but if he did only tell his mom.. she has a big mouth as well so I'm lucky the info didn't spread with more virility. In conclusion, I believe Tom spoke about my activities in order to soften the negative impact of his mother knowing about his own activity. ""Look, Sloany does this shit too and he's a bright fella."" After the fact I told this mofo, like WTF... I don't tell my family that you do dope and smoke crack. As far as they're concerned you're a professional in whatever you do. Well, in reality I used to say that. I stopped covering and started slandering his good name in front of my immediate family after the information leak as part of my damage control.


&nbsp;

After the info leak, my brother came over to have the talk and stage the intervention. The first question aside from how I was doing, of course it was the master inquiry. Am I doing dope? Where the fuck did you hear that from? Around the neighborhood you say? 


I love when someone rats you out or accuses you of something and nobody will tell you who. Like when I was kid in school and someone ratted me out for throwing food across the cafeteria or some other shit. Later on in life when I hear the saying, ""you have the right to face your accuser"", I think back to all the times I could've quoted that phrase when I was kid. Of course, the schools are like mini dictatorships. As for family interaction, I don't know why I can't be told who the fuck the source of the information leak is. Perhaps this is to make it more challenging for me to cover my tracks? It's not like I'm going to go beat the shit out of a friend who contacted my brother out of concern for my well being. 


&nbsp;


So anyway, a few months ago we have this talk in the family room due to an information leak. Aside from asking whether I was doing dope, my sibling also said, ""I was told that you tried to sneak Suboxone on to an airplane."" I truthfully stated, I did not *try* to sneak Suboxone on to a plane. I also attested to the fact that I went through a full body scan and physical frisking. Since I had a hunch of who made the information leak, I made up a story about a weed transaction gone awry and spoke about how Tom is in fact a crackhead. Crack is the worst (exaggeration) and people who do crack and heroin are even worse. **Would you trust the word of a crackhead-heroin addict?** Apologies to anybody who likes Crack and Dope who is reading, but this did prove effective as a means to draw suspicion away from myself.


In the end of that discussion, my brother was sufficiently satisfied as was my father after a urine test. Yes, many of us know that urine tests can be thrown and this proved effective in this instance.

#Start here if you don't care for the background info:

**During that intervention, before I sufficiently convinced the inquisition that I was not consuming dope, my brother stated, ""so, there is a detox period."" To which I responding, ""which is entirely unnecessary since I have nothing to detox from!""**


Fast forward to two days ago, I'm sitting at Cliff's kitchen table as he's prepping himself a line. I took a portion of a sub that day as I did for the days prior, the topic of cessation came up. I referenced the time I had that mini-intervention and how my brother referenced the ""detox period."" Cliff made light of addiction by saying that I needed detox as much as he didn't need Jenny Craig (he's a fat bastard). He argued that I by no means needed to detox, supposing that I wouldn't go through too much Withdrawal, if any whenever I stopped using dope.

&nbsp;

I felt like I was being told the sky is not blue. I know that I can at least experience withdrawal symptoms that last a solid three days. After the worst of it things smooth out but it still isn't the easiest week. This is why it's easy for someone to be drawn back to using dope once they have the means to get dope after seven days of nothing. If I wasn't addicted, I wouldn't be going out of my way to get Suboxone before getting dope-sick. 


It's like he sees the writing on the wall, that I'm not super committed to spending a bunch of money on dope this coming pay day. I've hinted many ways by indicating that there is no certainty that I'll buy dope this coming pay day. I still told him regardless of what I do, I'll still pick up his roxy script this week if time permits.",1520205927.0

*Paging purresident meff experts - /u/nosecandiez and /u/spinderella69 -- Please bless me with your knowledge.*

So I'm doing my once a pay period chip today...

I have my shitty heroin where .4 will barely get me where I want to be and I also have what wassupposedto be a gram of coke.

But, as you can probably guess, it fucking isn't.

It' a gram of what is obviously shitty meth. It smells like chemicals and tastes like ass. Now, because drug dealers don't exactly have a return policy I'm stuck with this shit.

I did a matchstick head sized bump as, I suppose, a test... And, okay, aside from the shaking hands and the fact I'm worried my overweight heart might explode *(I'm joking... more or less)* I'm okay doing this.

So, I guess my questions are as follows...

I'm obviously going to bang this shit, because, well, it's what I do. How much is an acceptable/safe amount to do based on my zero tolerance and the above report of the match-head bump?/

How many shots should I get out oh the just under a gram I have left?

Do I need to add heat to break it down in a spoon? For that matter is there anything special I need to know about banging da meff?

I'm saving the heroin for either the last shot, all nice and goofball-y, or as landing gear for when the well runs dry. Which is the better plan?

Lastly, how long between shots should I wait? I imagine it's gonna be fiend-y as fuck, so I'm hoping if I can make a scjedule  that'll help.

That's it ya'll.

There has been a couple very weird batches going around. I've gotten some like this, other ppl in my state. And my friend in the next state over.. Called me frantic the other night when he got something similar. 

I was buying fent off this dude for the past year. It was always white as snow, powder and clear in the rig. And it was fent for sure, as I tested it. Plus I always got pinned out, really warm, and super noddy. Well my plug was dry for half a day then picked up more. Now he always got the same thing. But everytime he reupped, I always did a tester shot first. Just because its fent i'm dealing with, and just incase something was not cut as much and too strong. Well thank fucking god I did because I prob would've died. 

I mixed the shot up, drew it up and only shot a tiny bit. Im talking like 5 units. All of a sudden, my heart started racing really fast. I was like ""ugh, great wtf is this""? Tried to be calm and not freak out totally, as this would make it worse. Then my heart started POUNDING. Wicked uncomfortably. Now I love shooting coke and speedballs. This was NOTHING like that at all. It was such a yucky feeling and just didnt feel right at all. I wouldn't have even thought there was any fent in it at all, besides the fact I was wicked sick before I did it.. But I got off E at least. It started to subside a little over time. But I still felt shaky and uppidy for a while after. 

There was another time something almost identical happened to me over this past summer. Bought it off one of my other dealers. But it was the same looking white powder. That time, the feeling came and went with the rush. Didn't linger for hours like this recent time. But that time, it made my pupils HUGE like I was rolling.

Ive shot dope/fent, coke, crack, ketamine, and molly before. And this weird ""fent"" or whatever the fuck it was.. Felt NOTHING like any of the other drugs Ive tried before. Has anyone else ever had stuff like this? 



TLDR; Was buying the same fent off this dude for almost a year. Got what was supposed to be fent, the same usual stuff I been doing (white powder, clear in the rig). But when I shot it, my heart started racing then pounding. Was mad jittery for like 2hrs after the shot. Out of 2 sketchy times this happened, one time my pupils turned to saucers. Has anyone else got shit like this recently?",1520197298.0

I spent my hotel money for the day on getting my puppers from the pound. Spoiled him and his mammy then got me high with the rest. 

Last time I actually lived outside I had a boyfriend by my side, my puppers, and was an unattractive lardass. I had no worries. I'd be lying if I didn't say being a skinny 'attractive' single female alone doing this didn't scare the shit out of me. Minding my own business with the doggies I got two $20s from guys who were trying to persuade me in the benefits of scratching each other's backs. Figuring out how to get my point across to these types is something I need to do ASAP. 
'No, I will not hook up with you for money.' 
'No, I will not date you for money.' 'If I'm single or not is irrelevant to you but thanks for the $20! I'm going to snag some breakfast tacos for my boyfran with it.' 
'No, you cannot have my number.' 'Fine, I will take yours and promise to get ahold of you as soon as I get phone turned on and charged later. I absolutely promise!' 
'Absolutely fucking do not try to hug me just to see how my dog reacts to it.'
'NO MEANS NO EVEN FOR HUGS DUDE.' 
Trying to exploit me for my less than favorable situation is the lowest of the low but refusing to take the hint and keep lingering is a sure fire way to get socked in the nuts. I didn't sleep with my fine ass persistent dealers even during my sickest brokest moments, you honestly think I'ma cave for a dude giving me extremely creepy mccreeperson vibes to get a roof over my head for the night? You found me perfectly content in the freezing cold roofless. He needs better leverage or a rag with chloroform. 

I made the full and complete decision to put myself in this situation, have to sacrifice for a better future. Right? I left a warm cozy house with a big comfy bed for this shit. My animals were miserable and treated like Sarah McLaughlin could make a home visit. I constantly heard the lady I lived with telling people my younger dog shouldn't even be alive and if she physically seen him she'd welcome him with a bullet. Enough of that so called animal lover talk and eventually my dog started moping around as if he was suicidal. She constantly threatened calling animal control on me for my cats just for the sheer number I had, not because they were miserable or miss treated. For all of ours sanity I decided a week of semi roughing it was better than another minute in those conditions. She randomly gave me pain pills and bars whenever she had them so I'mma miss that perk for sure. 

I only have to survive til Wednesday morning than I won't have to worry about where I can charge my phone next. I'm worried I made a careless irreplaceable mistake making this decision that has been leading to more than usual stress which makes me want to use more. Catch 22 for sure. I have a support system but am being stubborn about accepting help because I want to handle it all myself for once. 

I'm either going to fail losing everything that matters to me all at once, try to get smart with the wrong creeper and end up in some real life episode of Criminal Minds, or steady stay high and just let the flow decide my fate. ",1520196100.0

I got hit hard leaving a deal and ended up in a conference room with a 3 page contract in front of me. They had me on video and I could do a few years in prison for distribution or sign that and be on my way. I signed. All it really says is you aren't allowed to fuck for dope.

Once you work off your charge you start to get paid. I get paid 10% of whatever gets seized. Ounce of heroin for example street price ,2500 I get paid 250. They give the paper white boy drug prices but paying out not so much.

How it works is this. The deals the CI do the dealers aren't charged. The deals are just to get probable cause for a search warrant for car or home. What that turns up is where the charges come from. This keeps my identity a secret.

The biggest giveaway on deals where narcs are involved are the cars. There will be 4-5 cars shadowing the deal. They are obvious as fuck to me and I have no clue how people don't notice. Also, I don't wear wires, cameras, etc. They are filming from a block away.

I'm in a major city in the south and the one thing I found interesting is as soon as ounces are being discussed it gets kicked over to DEA. I was surprised it took so little to involve them.

Idk if you wanna put a Carfentenil warning up for philly - but a bunch of blocks just recently these last couple of weeks starting mixing in Carfentenil into their dope and it’s really fucked up. The shit is not an opiate high - it’s kind of like tripping on mushrooms. And for those people that have a high tolerance and get it, they do like 5,6,7 bags at once - it’s going to fuck their mind up like they’ve never been fucked before. That’s personal experience right there too.

I just recently went to a popular set and copped, and even they added the Carfentenil. I’m scared to do anymore than 2 bags now. ANYWHERE; and I know every block and every set really really well.



Edit-I have received a lot of PM's about this warning, and I just want to say that I do not live in this area and I don't know anything about the dope there. I posted this for another member who asked me to post it. This is a copy/paste of the PM they sent me

I haven't done this batch myself. But a few of my friends have. And one of my boys is on 150mgs of methadone. He's ok now, but he said it straight knocked him on his ass.

Then, let's imagine this person getting enough sleep, food, having meaningful experiences and relationships, not wrecking their economy because of the heroin, etc. - the only actual effect on their day-to-day life is the fact that they'll get sick if they don't get their fix in time.

To me a recovering heroin addict when I first got sober I somewhat bought the disease argument, as I've spent more time I can't think of it as an incurable disease. I personally believe it's a grey area, the mind creates a very strong mental and physical craving for the drugs and an unwillingness to face the withdrawal symptoms and you can see why people getting addicted to substances for long times.

However, my biggest concern about the disease diagnosis is that a lot of addicts I've met create a label in there head. They create a belief that they have this incurable disease and this belief becomes almost subconscious; becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy.

In my personal story, I always dislikes the diagnosis that I had a helpless malady. So the label never stuck. Since I've been clean of heroin 2 years  I've done othe drugs even percocets and have drank occasionally, but now the gaps between my using have gotten longer and longer. Haven't had any mind altering substance in more than 2 months, my life is getting ""better"" and I feel more content and alive than ever.
