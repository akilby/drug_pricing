SHARE your experience!,"I'm early into my recovery from 5 years of heroin addiction. About a month ago, my life came utterly crashing down. I won't really go into specifics but you can read my post history if you would like to know more. I basically lost my job, apartment, girlfriend, and car in the span of a week due to my heroin use. My father also just died while holding my hand, fighting for his life, just the other night. I'm going through a lot right now, but despite my shitty life I'm still about 3 weeks clean from heroin. 

.      .My doctor and family both have been pressuring me to receive a vivitrol injection as soon as possible. I am very hesitant not because I want to use, but because of the whole idea of blocking my opiate receptors. It would only make sense that the blocking mechanism would also effect things like runners/weightlifting highs, the euphoric effects that music brings me, and maybe even food and sex. Call me crazy, but I feel like Vivitrol would effect my overall mood and I would lose sense of who I really am. I'm a paranoid person and I feel as if Vivitrol would cause me to blame every negative emotion I'll have on the shot. How would I ever be able to accurately identify if I'm experiencing side effects from vivitrol, or is it PAWs that's causing these potential issues? Can anyone relate? Am I making sense here? Please, anyone would like to share their experience with vivitrol please do so. Thank you.",1512230392.0

forgot my old login and was more of a lurker anyhow soooo new acct, old junkie me haha :'D

I'm gonna go to mexico over nye after an ibogaine treatment (2nd round). Unforunately while the first one helped, I relapsed after 2 mo. clean. It changed a lot of my attitude tho, I'm not on MMT anymore and actually have goals n shit.

 Now, I have friends over the pond in Mexico where I will go after xmas to smooth over the transition into normal life. A biggie that lead me to using here is that I have almost no clean friends leftt and Germany is socially as cold as the weather, although we have a geat welfare system. To get back into life, I planned a trip to mexico until spring.

My friends there use, no H tho. H is a no-go, Pills & coke are fine tho. I know its hypocrytical but for me its good, as I need them to score anything worthwile without getting into situations I dont wanna be in. I have a job lined up over there even tho Im not even done with Uni over here. And good friends that would rather slap my WDing ass instead of getting me H

Now I know I will use there. Altho its gonna be pharms, coke and weed, for me I will use as it is vacation. I just want to get rid of the addiction. Maybe that mindset will change but atm thats how I see it. Ill take Ibo in 2 weeks, doing H until then, so Ill be physically set once I arrive. Some Questions:

How is it with the legality of pharms thereP My friends say its noi prob to get benzos & tramadol. I really wanna try Opana at least once in my life. Is it smarter to go the DNM route or will it be avavible via local sources?

Same w/ oxy, Dillies, hydrocodone. I really DONT wanna do H there, as thats my DOC. I know, its all the same, but honestly for me and esp my friends there its a red line I dont wanna cross. I love that country and would hate to fuck it up for me addiction-wise. Also, I dont wanna deal w alll the shady drug war shit. Im from Germany, our dope is shit but its all rather safe. I prefer not to get shot or mugged in an alleyway.

Rigs: I can get rly good coke there, my friends dont shoot and I prefer them not seeing me shoot up, but I wanna try that good yay IV if Im there at least once. Are they avavible?

If not -  can so. maybe send me a care package w/ rigs n supply stuff ( NO DOPE), I'll paypal you the cost.

Is Narcan avavible? Esp w the strong pillls and seeing that some of our crew are opiate naive and some arnt, I wanna be prepared. I wont turn guys on that shit, not my style, but I know that if some of us do oxy, Opana or god forbid H, some will folllow. I dont want any dead friends. If not -  same as above - can so. from the US maybe help me out?

Also, general Mexico thread: What should I look out for, any tips (not just drug related)? Any stories?

thx, happy nods and may morpheus be with us all in these dark hours <3

So my question is based on what i used to take, how much morphine and codeine should i plug ? Also when i take codeine i do a cold water extraction so there is a lot of water, it's going to be hard to plug right ? maybe i should plug the morphine and then just drink the codeine after i plugged the morphine ? but then i'm scared that it might not kick in at the same time .. And also a last question, do i have to plug it all at once ? because when i crush my morphine pills it seems pretty hard for me to get all the powder in only 1 syringe, i'm almost 100% sure that there will still be some powder left in it so i wonder if i can do 2 plugs or something in order to get all the powder in my ass and not waste some",1512219372.0

I’m between chips for the time being and reading and writing posts keeps me sane. For whatever help or interest it may be here’s the methadone chapter of my life story haha:

I was pretty naive when I started. I could find pills whenever I wanted back then but my habit had outgrown my budget and I just wanted to be free of the daily grind of hunting and waiting for my feel-good shit. At the peak of my using then I was taking 8-10 hydros a day (this was before oxy became so available).  

I was 26 then and in hindsight could have detoxed myself rather easily but the allure of a daily dose for $11 + gas money was too seductive. I had never even tried it before I walked into the clinic with a using friend of mine for my intake and first dose. I’ll never forget the look on my buddy’s face after about 5 minutes down the road from the clinic we turned to each other with the biggest holy shit-eating grins! We felt like we had hit the lottery. 

Twenty minutes later I’m at home on the couch nodding harder than I had ever experienced until that time. The clinic had started me off at 25 mg and in hindsight it was probably too high for someone with a hydrocodone addiction and it took a couple of weeks messing with my dose before I hit that sweet spot of high enough not to be almost completely sedated for most of my waking hours. I kinda wanted to be lucid enough to hold down a job lol. It was the most powerful opiate I had ever used and it would be 15 years before I would ever touch a pain pill again.

Fast forward through ten years of methadone maintenance treatment which included a move in the middle to the Pacific Northwest and transferring to a new clinic and all that entails and then back home still on the done. 

Through all those years I had got my dose as high as 60 mg per day down to 6 mg per day. At the end, I was back around where I started at 30 mg but not taking all of my take-home doses. I was getting a two weeks supply by this time and trading the leftovers for weed or cash as needed. I got called in for a bottle check and lost my take-home privileges. I had no drivers license at that time and no way of making the 70 mile round trip for daily doses. I found a local doctor prescribing suboxone and stayed on that for another four years but that’s another chapter and I’ve rambled on enough.

I guess the whole point of the story is that I will feed my addiction however I can based on whatever circumstances I’m faced with and at the same time strive daily to have as much of a normal life as possible. Balancing those two often conflicting things has been the struggle of my life so far and its daily, high or not high.

I'm not an opioid user, but I used to lurk here after dating one a while back. I've run into a dilemma, and y'all seemed like the people to ask.

I have endometriosis, which causes very severe monthly pain. I managed to book a long flight for a bad pain day this month. Seeing as the flight is in a week and my pain has only recently gotten much worse, I don't have many options as far as getting doctor appointments, medications (birth control would work but takes too long to kick in), etc. 

I have Percocet lying around from a dental surgery, and I'm considering taking it during the flight. The only time I've taken it before, I got horrifically nauseated. So, here are my questions:

1) Is there any reason this might be a bad idea?

2) Is there any way I can avoid or mitigate the nausea? I'll probably be vomiting from the endo anyway. Don't want to make it worse. 

3) Someone told me opioids don't take away pain; they just make you not care about it. Is that true? I don't think I want to take the amount of any drug it would take to make me not care about this pain. It can get to a 9/10--nearly delirious, lying on the floor unable to move, etc. 

Edit: Also, how much would be appropriate for an opioid-naive person with severe pain who wants to be as mentally alert as possible?",1512195436.0

First time ever using.,"For some reason I thought my mom wasn't going to let the doctor give me a perscription for pain meds to use after he yanked all my wisdom teeth out so I looked around and found a friend that had a perscription.

Well I buy 8 off him and he says, ""there 5mg each and 3 puts me on my ass so don't take more than that at once I don't want you getting hurt""

I'd already read some posts about hydros and how people said they didn't really feel great until 20-25mg with no tolerance.

Well I have never taken hydros, except one time where I mixed 1 pill with a xan and a lot of coke but that was a long tome ago and a story for another time. What I'm trying to say is I had no tolerance going into this.

Since he said they were 5mg and most people don't feel really good until 20-25mg I'll take 6 so I'm at 30mg and will feel more than what they're describing as an awesome experience. A lot of people were saying they throw up around these doses or get naesuas but that's never really been a problem for me and I've never thrown up on any drug save alcohol.

Well I took them at 10:34pm, roughly 12 hours till I had to be at the oral surgeon for my wisdom teeth removal. By 4 am I was still unable to sleep, I was slightly itchy all over but as the night wore on the itching was more in my legs. I felt like I had no worries and a really cozy feeling like I was sitting right in front of a fireplace. 

9 am rolls around and I try getting out of bed only to find it's difficult to walk. Odd. Hydro high only lasts like 4-6 hours I thought I read. Look in the mirror and pupils are non existent. Don't get me wrong I've had this effect before when I first found fent ( i only did fent a handful of times)

Get so nervous that the annestesia will boost the effects of the hydros and make me not wake up, pray before they put me under. Wake up everything's good. I still had 2 hydros left so I checked them literally an hour ago and read the engraved writing on it. They are white oval shaped and read Watson, and below that ""853"" look it up and realize they are 10mg pills and that I took double what I thought I was taking. Oof.

7h0uli,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7h0uli/my_mom_is_junkie_jesus/,31,https://redd.it/7h0uli,Ceraleen,My mom is Junkie Jesus?,"Ever since I became an addict, every day my mom drops something like [this](https://i.imgur.com/Kl53W4S.jpg) off. When I was in the worst of my addiction there would be up to 7 pills in that baggie every day. Sure, I had dealers and bought from them. But my mom also had a prescription for the drug I was buying, and figured by doing this I wouldn't feel like I had to seek out drugs and I could use and get high, without getting myself into any bad situations. This started when I came to her telling her I was an addict and wanted help. 

Of course her plan was to slowly wean me down, which we did. Unsuccessfully. Every time she got her script I seemed to have an excuse as to why I needed extra and I'd milk that excuse for so long. Until she didn't have enough to give me my normal amount every day either. So she'd buy some and we'd have a talk and I'd agree to try again. This lasted a few months, until I finally decided to go on methadone. When I did I felt so much better, I didn't need to use anymore. I could get through the day without it. Except all my chronic pain came back, and so did the unbearable migraines three times a week at least. And imagine a doctor would prescribe any sort of pain meds? (Even though none of my doctor's know in an addict). So, I started asking her for a few every day and I was spiralling down that hole. So one day when she came to drop off my smokes with the little baggie attached to the side she told me she understood im in pain and offered to give me one a day, without fail. No more, no less. And that I didn't have to take it, but if I needed it it would at least be there and asked me if that would make me feel a bit better and not feel like I always had to be finding my next pills to make sure that when pain did start I had something. It was turning it into a sure thing. I agreed. Sometimes I have to take more than one, like when I had to have a few teeth pulled or when I had my d&c after my miscarriage and sometimes on just a really bad day pain wise, and she'll agree but she keeps tabs and if I ask top many days in a row she asks my what's bothering me, and sometimes I don't even realize something is until she asks, and once we talk about it it's easy to go back to just having the one. There have been times that I've been able to go weeks without taking the pills she drops off and I don't have any temptation to, and I love when that happens. There are other times (like now and recently) that I don't touch that pill because I've been using heroin. 

Obviously I'll always have my bad days, and I know I'll relapse and I know that's normal. But the fact that she listens when no doctor really does means a lot. My family doctor wants to give me a script, she believes in in as much pain as I am as often as I claim to be, but she says in too young (im almost 21, she's been saying this since I started complaining of pain at 16). The doctor at the methadone clinic also recently brought up that he's considering giving me a script for pain as well, and it feels nice to finally be getting somewhere. I can't wait until the day that I don't have to rely on my mom to drop off a pill for me every day. But I love her so much for doing so, and for understanding that my addiction didn't form only from mental pain, but from physical too and that I can't get better until the pain im in is under control. I love her so much and thank her every day for supporting me.

Tinychat can be VERY shitty about the mobile app so if you can connect with a computer, that is the best option.
firstly, this chat is not affiliated with this subreddit or its moderators, and has its own moderators, rules, and etiquette. if you feel someone there has slighted you take it up with the moderators of tinychat, as it is completely unaffiliated with and not endorsed by this or any other subreddit.
just a reminder and an announcement that a bunch of your fellow degenerate junkies, chippers, and tourists hang out in our very own tinychat room which has been an ongoing tradition for something like four years now. the location, for those who can't do links for whatever reason, is http://tinychat.com/ropiatesubchat.


tinychat is an extremely buggy videochat client, but also the only one that fills its particular niche---that being, anyone who knows the room name may enter, and it has a youtube player. any technical difficulties may be addressed by the moderator, namely me. we like to hang out, listen to music, talk about random shit, and lately have even had our own resident sketch artist who draws random crap upon request. the primary purposes for the room's existence are companionship and harm reduction---it's nice to be able to shoot up with others around, even if you are technically alone in the non-digital sense, and have people keeping an eye on you. we're also glad to help with any problems you might be having, or questions you might need answered. we aim to be a welcoming, friendly space for the members of this subreddit to do what we do in good company without judgement. so stop by if you are bored, or just need to talk.
if it appears like there is a moderator in the room but who is not speaking, just type a few sentences to summon them back. if you are on mobile it is not immediately apparent that there is anyone in the room. either click the button shaped like an outline of a person (i think) to see the list, or say hello to see if anyone responds.


rules:
pick a unique username. this is to protect other users so we know who is who, given the nature of the sort of activities we enjoy.
no lurking. again, to protect the other users. if you come in the room be prepared to introduce yourself and participate for at least a few minutes so we know you're not up to any shenanigans. if you are lurking you will be warned and then given a generous ten minutes to announce yourself. if the time runs out, you will be kicked (not banned) until you are ready to come in and actually participate. if you are a known member whose identity can be confirmed, this rule is not applicable.


no -isms or hate speech, even accidental. one warning will be issued, any continued insistence on such behavior will result in a ban. bans can be contested by pm'ing a moderator (me). this includes but is not limited to racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia. for example, if you are not black, use of the n-word, even with the -a ending, will not be tolerated. i don't care if your friend down the block lets you say it, it's not your lane.


no auditory fuckery. due to peculiarities of the transmission of sound over a chat, certain echos and effects can be amplified to the point of being severely distressing. if it is determined that your end is causing an echo you will be asked to use headphones, or to mute your microphone when not speaking. deliberately making strange or unpleasant noises to annoy other chatters will not be tolerated, and your broadcast will be closed. (this only means that your video/audio feed will be terminated--you will still be allowed to type.)

This hasn't been easy. Look what you made me do. *(bonus points if you catch the cheesy reference)* 

I originally joined r/opiates roughly 5 years ago. Mainly to gain insight into my brother's Heroin addiction and death. As I gained that insight I was ultimately getting sick myself. It took a year to diagnose me with a rare condition that has led to chronic pancreatitis and what I still expect is a lifetime of pain.

For 4-5 years I've been on and off the opioids and for the last 3 years I've been on them nonstop. 

During my opiate career I've had two boyfriends both non-users. The first would berate me over my addiction and pain problems but was a complete alcoholic. Double standards much? I think so. 

The 2nd boyfriend came within the last four months. He's been very sweet and we've been talking a lot about my health especially since I was starting to consider a need to get off the opiates even a few months before we met. 

However, as time with him went on and I got to a point where things were do or die for me, myself, I & my future with this new guy. ^(you know how you know it's the one? That's how I feel about this guy) 

So, when I ran out of my script 5 days early and had no money to supplement it, I made a difficult decision. I jumped off the medication cold turkey.

I was on an average of 70mgs of the stuff before I went something like this:

* Day 1: 50mgs
* Day 2: 40mgs
* Day 3: 35mgs
* Day 4: 25mgs
* Day 5: 0mgs

I consumed my last dose at 7pm on November 25th, 2017. Ironically, if we turned the clock back 7 years my brother would be alive for another 5 days before he'd die of his Heroin OD. I would be clean & sober the day of his death for the first time in 5 years. It's kinda spooky to me and means something. I don't know I've always believed in dates and time and things like that, that everything is connected for a reason and sometimes ***what you think is bad isn't always the worst thing. Sometimes it's even good***.

With that said I've been battling a Kidney Infection plus my period on top of the withdrawal so needless to say it's been intense. Since quitting some big things I've done are as follows:

1. Declined Narcotics at my Drs. Office
2. Flushed a 10mg Oxycodone Tablet Down the Toliet
3. Declined my usual refill & declined a muscle relaxant as well
4. informed all my Doctors of the change

I am becoming a new person. Entirely. They say every 7 years your cells regenerate to make you new again and 7 years past my brother's death, I am finally new again.",1512184530.0

It started moving around towards my tailbone, stayed in my feet which hurt the most, and got to my hands for like half of a second.

Is that an allergic reaction to the cut, or what happened there? It’s happened before with a different stamp a while ago, but was much more mild than what I experienced this time.

Let me know what you guys think, you will identify with it 10x more than your average reader.","Ok, a quick background on this. Before I started shooting roxies and Opanas and dope, I was one of the highest rated creepypasta authors in the site's all time index, and I was the head of the Monolith forum there before derpbutt purchased the site from WhoWasPhone.

I had written plenty of horror stories. Creature features, ghost tales, you name it. However, when I finally went to treatment for my addiction, I hadn't written any fiction in two years. I stopped caring about fiction even though I was a published author on Amazon. My excuse at first was ""The drugs make me creative,"" but eventually, I didn't create. I just got high and nodded on my couch.

I'll be celebrating a year clean on January 9th, 2018. I wrote the first story of this series, Anhedonius, freehand in a notebook when I was detoxing off dope and afraid of all the meetings and hanging out with fellow junkies in rehab. I finished it about a month later, and then I wrote a sequel.

This is a horror fiction story about a heroin junkie who gets kidnapped by a pharmaceutical company that basically invents a cure for cancer and any other serious disease, but they have to murder and farm people with altered Mu receptors in their brains to manufacture it. It's very long, but quite horrific, and I poured my heart and soul into it, because for all intents and purposes, the main character is basically the way I was when I was on drugs.

Instead of reading Anhedonius, you can listen to if if you want on The Mad Catter's Twisted Teatime podcast, which is on iTunes, Soundcloud, Stitcher, and all that shit. Or you can just go to the youtube link.

[www.creepypasta.com/anhedonius](www.creepypasta.com/anhedonius) (to read) or

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8bYj_FEpzo&t=104s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8bYj_FEpzo&t=104s) (to listen)

The sequel, Liquid Blue, should be uploaded on creepypasta within 24 hours, as I just finished it about two hours ago. No podcast for this one yet, but if you're from San Francisco or you're familiar with the Tenderloin, it's right up your ""alley.""

Liquid Blue:

If you'd like to purchase one of my novels off Amazon from the old days or donate to me, I'll be publishing a new short story compilation in January, but all I really ask is for reviews for my writing on creepypasta/NoSleep/Pseudopod or any other medium that my writing has been accepted in.

Thank you for reading, and remember, there is a way out, and you can care again about things that fell by the wayside as this shit slowly takes over your life. You can get it back, because I did. It wasn't easy, but I did it, and you can too.

Stay warm, guys, and I hope you enjoy this. I worked very hard on it.

This man is straight up business. And he's  ""not a damn credit card company "", aka does not front. In all the years I've known him (5 years copping from him, known even longer) I got one front from him. 

So I do roofing work and get paid daily, so after work I always go to my dude after I get paid. Today was different. My boss couldn't pay me until like 5 hours after I got off and I was starting to get sick. I only had enough cash for half of my normal pickup and it would not have been nearly close to enough to keep me well until after work the following day and my dboy shuts down shop before I would be getting paid tonight. I decided it would be my monthly ask for a front and get shot down day. So I ask and even tell him a can pay him tonight outside of business hours... And he says yes! Oh my god.  I was stoked and already about to meet him. Then 5 minutes go by and he texts and says he doesn't want to front anymore.  WTF? I called him and was like what the hell you just said you would and we proceed to go back and forth and he finally says, after me guaranteeing that I could pay him tonight,  ""Aight, we gon do this then champ"" I said ""hell yeah we are! ""

I proceed to get my bag, get high and nod out blissfully(: now I'm about to get my money and he's going to come pick it up and bring me a tester of some new shit.

Does anyone have any personal experience with diprenorphine (bupe's super high affinity cousin)? The wiki article and a few other research articles online state that is has a very small amount of agonist activity. I'm mostly interested in its potential use as a mild buzz for anyone being forced into Vivitrol/naltrexone since it's one of the few opioids that can easily out-bind naltrexone (and nobody tests for it).

How the fuck do I achieve that? I've tried therapy. I've tried medication. I've tried detox. I've overdosed. My mindset never changed. I want to feel good forever. The harsh truth is you need to experience that pain to grow. I wish I could tell you what drove me to get clean. It wasn't about living because I OD'd and had to be revived and I kept using. 

The thing is, I didn't use to hurt other's. My using brought on pain to the people around me that I don't want to feel. My reason for using was an escape from having to experience those negative emotions. I never thought I'd change my mind.

One day I woke up and just didn't want to shoot heroin anymore. I wasn't afraid of the sickness anymore. My biggest fear at that time was losing myself. 

I don't even remember my clean date because we're constantly changing and for me to mark a change isn't my vibe. I just know every Tuesday is another week I didn't use. So maybe that is counting. 

I'm rambling now but the main point I was trying to make is that I just woke up one day and didn't want to use. The sight of heroin turns my stomach. I used to get boners looking at prepped  needles but now it makes me sick.

As Sara gets out to pay some random tells her he thinks a couple guys ODed in their car on the other side of the parking lot. Visibly freaked out Sara asks if I'd check it out and of course I agree not wanting anyone to die if it can be helped.

Both guys have their chins on their chests and certainly look dead so I knock on the window and when that gets no response I open the drivers unlocked door. It was at this time I got a good look at the driver and realized I know the guy, I also realized they were both breathing but just to make sure they were alright I tried to wake them. My friend (Guy) slept through me yelling his name and shaking him, his passenger woke up but when I warned him of the probable police appearance in the near future he just mumbled something at me and closed his eyes again. That's when someone walks up to me from the store and asks if I had a light so we walk to my car so I can get him one.

After handing this guy a lighter he asks if I get high, since we've never met I say no and even though I said no dude starts offering me Xanax and ice then asks if he can come with Sara and I. Of course I say no and that's when Sara comes back to the car and tells us the girls working there had called the cops cuz dude wouldn't leave and was freaking them put. I run to Guy's car, slap the fuck out of him and when he finally wakes up I warn him about the cops, run back to Sara's car and got the fuck out of there.

My phone goes off and I see it's Guy thanking me for the wake up call, apparently he was up for way to long and crashed waiting for the creepy guy who was only supposed to be grabbing smokes but just never came back out. I told him about his creepy friend getting the cops called and he said soon as dide got high he started acting weird, then I made him promise to take a nap and here I am!

There's not really a point to this story but I would like to acknowledge the way everyone assumed these two guys ODed when the only thing to suggest they use heroin is they're sleeping in their car and in their early twenties.

i want my final hit to be a warning to myself. i feel i need to put myself in that corner instead of being one foot in and one foot out-- either binging or withdrawing.

is it that much more cost effective to use the needle, and how destructive is it to your veins with clean apparatus and DNM dope?

i know smoking is the fastest way for a drug to reach the brain, so with no tolerance am i simply better off smoking a giant blob at once? since the needle rush, i assume, is because tolerance prevents any rush from smoking as it would take several hits-- while at baseline tolerance could smoking a BIG hit achieve the same results?",1512353111.0

Well of course, I give him my money yesterday and after some bullshitting about hitting me up in a few mins, he turned his phone off and has been ignoring me since then. Now, not only did I get ripped off for $200, but I lost my ONLY connect, AND the prospect of getting another connect.

If he had told me he wanted $200 for the connect, I would have given it to him, but instead he fucking robs me AND doesn’t give me the connect. WHAT THE FUCK?!?",1512345642.0

I just moved to another state and wanted to smoke...but had no connects nor do I know anyone who partakes in opiates. I've never tried picking up on Craigslist. I read a couple post back in the day about people having success with roofing​ tar for their leaky roofs and thought I'd give it a shot.  


Well, after a few texts to a handful of posters I found this one dude who wanted to talk on the phone first before texting. That was alright with me because herring the person's voice makes it easier to see if they're up to something grimey or just hoping you're not a cop and a cool person. I felt comfortable meeting up with the dude after speaking to him and was confident he was legit.  

Got to the meeting spot, waited 10 mins, talked to the dude for a bit, made the transaction and boom!!...success!  

Just picked up a g just in case it was bunk, fake or I got ripped off. It's good stuff and pleased with how it all went down. Got lucky on my first time and glad nothing sketchy went down.  

Does anyone else have experience using CL? Did you have to try multiple times before you copped? What were the good and/or bad things that went down in trying to pickup?

This isn't a gratuitous shot, it's a small sampling of the crazy amount of prescriptions that I still have left over.  This is about a third of everything tucked away for the last 2 years.

Here in the US, a lot of chronic pain patients set aside a portion of their scripts each month. This is mainly because they know that when they go in for their next monthly visit to get scripts, there is a good chance the doctor will not prescribe what they need.  The DEA looks for ANYTHING that will give them cause to suspend a pain specialist's license.  

In Florida, the DEA now sets up stings like this regularly.  Recently, an undercover agent got prescribed 2 week's worth of hydrocodone (qty 30 - 5/325) for claiming and ACTING like they hurt their back.  The doctor knew that he shouldn't write for a full month and wanted to see if the the guy came back with an MRI as requested.  The next day, the DEA raided the place.  It wasn't a cash-only ""pain clinic"" but a general practitioner who had been in business for over 30 years.

Since the DEA is waging war on doctors now, many patients are choosing to stash a portion from what may be their last script.  There is even a small but growing delivery industry in cities like Miami and Tampa, catering to older people who have had their meds taken away or cut back.  It's not unheard of for many senior citizens to actually procure heroin through these delivery services, as hydro and oxy are both now ~$1 per mg.  It is sickening to me; people who take advantage of other people and the government that forces their hand are creating businesses that feed on someone's medical need.

I wasn't crushing it, but I was doing well. 10 months on kratom... even had wife and son both gets scripted pain meds for surgeries in that time and I was so proud of myself for not only not touching them but for not even giving a shit that they were in the house.


Been trading someone a good portion of my over-prescribed Xanax (I don't need 3mg a day doc, you already have me on 1.5mg of klonopin and I have mild anxiety at best) with a friend for their gabapentin and suboxone strips. Figured might as well diversify my comfort med stash where the gaba is concerned, and the subs for traveling without worrying about bringing kratom (which works, for those of you on kratom but not against suboxone - I replace 15-20g a day with 1mg and I'm good. Nice thing too is subs don't interact with kratom the way they do with full agonists. I've woken up, dosed 4g, then remembered I won't be home until midnight, dosed 1mg of sub like 40 minutes later - no problem).



Anyway, friend calls up wanting more xanax. I pretty much always have more to give, so I ask for subs... no subs... no gabas.... some time goes by with no text activity and then..


""I can get you blk""


I'm on the west coast so I knew exactly what that was. I said yes. Out of nowhere suddenly I'm driving to go trade my xanax for fucking black tar heroin. I wasn't having cravings or anything, it's like the offer caught me off guard and the addict in me quickly muffled the ""what are you doing you fuckhead"" voice before it could help me. 


That was one week ago. Smoked maybe a point or two every day. Still used kratom in front of my wife. Yesterday while my wife was out with our kid was the first real alone time I had instead of having to sneak quick smokes in, and I found myself putting a humongous chunk - like half of what was left of the g I got, onto the foil, and I didn't stop until it was all fucking gone. I was finally *high* high. And I couldn't believe how much I was and to smoke and handle it. Was at least 3 points. I tossed the tiny bit that was left in the garbage and went off to do house cleaning. Didn't puke didn't nod just feeling amazing. The act of throwing the rest away actually helped have a good high and not worry about how much more I'll do, but I was far from proud of myself. 


I feel fine today. Tar is gone, back on kratom, but I obviously am still fucking addicted which was a huge bummer to realize. 10 months on this kratom shit too and I've been unable to lower my intake to any significant degree, and now am back to more like 20-25g a day. No breaks for the holidays - everything will either be working or spending time with family; no time to lie on bed feeling like shit but at least recovering. Then it'll be back to the normal grind. No end in sight, I'm gonna be drinking this sludge three times a day for the foreseeable future.",1512322523.0

Anyways, l have been on methadone and suboxone and personally feel like methadone is helping me far more than suboxone. Of coarse one reason could be the structure of the methadone clinic and making sure I️ dose everyday. Obviously there are ways to get around having to dose everyday at the clinic by making yourself throw up the dose, getting take home eligible ( using clean urine or using one of many loop holes for drug test), or just skipping the trip to clinic and not dosing the days you want to skip. With suboxone it was nice to get a full two week to a months worth script at the start of treatment but resulted in those being sold and running short sometimes.. however this is getting off subject... l honestly feel like methadone is much harder to use heroin and be able to reach a decent high than suboxone. This seems hard to believe because suboxone has a blocker in it but methadone forms a hell of a blocker once over 60 mg for at least a couple months. Even when l skip four to five days of methadone the high is short lived. The rush after the injection is followed by a non euphoric waiste of a high that isn’t even being high.. With subs l found that it is easy to break thru the blocker of the dose is lower like 4mg or less. But if it has built up in higher doses then waiting 2 or 3 days without taking suboxone and then shoot heroin produces a very nice high from heroin. Of coarse one must be careful dosing the suboxone after taking heroin because of precipitated Wd. I’m just wondering other experiences with this and would love to know Any tricks to being a chipper on maintenance therapy. I’m on 65 mg methadone currently and have lowered my dose from 90 in hopes to feel dope more but still have the benefits of methadone and it has helped some . l feel dope about 10-15% of what I️ should . .....why can’t us junkies find the perfect drug to keep Wd away but be able to get high when we want and feel normal and good when we don’t ",1512484726.0

Fast forward to today. I've burned several bridges, ran off on a couple plugs in times of dire need. I've lost control of my habit and it shows. I wear the same old clothes, haven't bought new shoes in over a year. Most of my friends have cut ties with me or at least distanced themselves and the ones that haven't feel pity and are on the fence of whether or not to leave. I'm a laughing stock I feel among my social circle. 

But it's all worth it right? I try to get clean, tell myself ""this is it"" every time, but every payday it seems I lose control. What's worse is I can't even envision myself in a life without opiates. I have crippling anxiety around my family, for instance. I don't know how to act around kids and my nieces and nephews try to connect with me and I'd love to, but when I'm sober I'm a cold shell. When I'm high I'm the most loving uncle, brother and son.

I miss the old days. High school me, life of the party. When I could just have fun smoking a few joints and doing hood rat shit with my friends. I felt I had an imagine to keep up as the crazy one, the life of the party and now I'm paying for it.

It’s sort of a face my own fears thing since I’ve always had a phobia of needles going into my veins as well as simple curiosity and to be able to say I’ve done/ can do it (probably not gonna actually tell anyone of course lol).  Also, it was a combination of hanging out on this sub sort of desensitizing me to the idea of IVing as well as my intention for a while now to run a cycle of steroids (which I do have) and therefore needing to buy rigs for IM injections anyways so might as well buy insulin syringes while I’m at it. 

I haven’t actually injected anything yet, I did two ‘tests’ if you will tonight, both times I was planning on injecting a saline solution I made but decided against it on both occasions for different reasons. 

The first time was into the big vein in the crook of the arm, got it in on the first try and registered dark red, lazy blood so I know I was good but I noticed a decent sized air bubble in the syringe so I decided against injecting just to be safe. 

The second time was in a vein a little further up on the forearm and it went smoothly as well but this time it was like it registered without me pulling the plunger. I figured there must have been some dead space in there and it plumed up because I hit the vein but it was a very small amount of blood and it caused a small raised area around the injection site which I assumed was just blood leaking out of the vein, but since I didn’t know if I had accidentally gone all the way through the vein or what so I again pulled it out and abstained from injecting to be safe. It doesn’t hurt or anything but I put a warm compress on it anyways and then a bandage. 

Any thoughts guys? Tips? This sort of just a bucket list thing like learning how to fly a small plane or learning a new language or something like that. I may use this skill to IV a drug one day if I got ahold of something that wouldn’t be effective orally like morphine (not dope, I’m talking pharmaceuticals) but that’s not necessarily the end goal. I like my hydro just fine and there’s no need to inject it or all that APAP lol. I will continue practicing and would like advice, I also gotta practice the IM injections for the testosterone so I gotta lot of poking myself to do, pins and needles amirite?

It’s white, and it seems to stick to stick to itself pretty bad. Does that seem like anything someone is semi familiar with or nah?

Like I thought U-47700 was active nasally, but it was just caustic to the point to make it want to be avoided for insufflation; whatever this is is for sure caustic, but almost not even noticeable in terms of a high when insufflated. Does anybody have an idea of if this is like a bunk cut or an idea of the chemical series whatever this is is in.

Whatever it is isn’t even noticeable when insufflated though (asides from having a nosebleed the next day), but like with swallowing the drip it feels similar to oxy (with out as much of a blissful rush, just more of a sedated and relaxed type feeling), it’s white, and it seems to rock up way worse than the fent laced stuff I was getting (like it sticks to credit cards way worse).",1512453393.0

Apart from my bank account being raped, I just absolutely cannot stand the withdrawls I go through when I run out. I work 2 jobs 7 days a week however one is pretty chill and from @ home so I try to time when I run out during this period (Monday & Tuesday) and from wednesday to sunday I work at one of australia's standard supermarkets as a cleaner & trolley pusher.

I cannot work the supermarket job during withdrawls, I always end up curled up in a corner and do absolutely the bare minimum (somehow) for my entire shift.

Everytime I try I become a pig and eat too much in one sitting but I've promised myself this lot is for tapering and for some reason I am confident I can stick to it, as the deterrents are starting to over ride the small 'high' feeling the oxy produces me.

I've written this and rewrote it four times but it just keeps becoming too long. So here I go again, if this gets posted then it must be short enough.


&nbsp;


**Phase 1:**

[Cliff convinced me to give up the last of my money two weeks ago for a really good price on bulk subs.]() A week later he pays me back with a portion of his roxy script. The following week I can't pick up my sub script until my new photo ID comes in so I buy some dope for the two of us. Cliff assures me that he'll have subs before the week is over.


&nbsp;


**Phase 2:**

Each day I get another forestallment. ""We don't need them today anyway, we both still have pills.""


By saturday I get to the bottom of the barrel and am met with more forestallments. Hell, he even had me come outside the night before to meet the girl who he was middling for. You see, ""it was part of the deal"" that she gets subs while he middles for her. Up until that moment I was expecting her to have subs.

As we're waiting outside I start getting indicatiosn that she might not have subs on her right now, which is why he wants me to come outside to hear their convrsation. So that I know I'm not being deceived. 

&nbsp;

He says to the girl that getting subs on Saturday is ""much importante"" to which she responds, ""I'll try."" Fuck this shit. ""I'll try"" is a far cry fro mthe high expecations that were originally set.


Then on saturday, although I was told she'd get the subs in the morning I don't find out for sure til 3pm.. at which point I'm told she's picking them up at 6pm. After 6pm I text Cliff, ""so she has the subs"" to which he responds, ""ya"". 

When I get ""ya"" in place of an affirmateive yes, I read it like a tell. A sign that I'm being lied to. So of course, she doesn't want to make two trips so she's not dropping off the subs until Cliff can see his pill connect. 

&nbsp;


An hour keeps getting added to the ETA for the pill guy. Around 11pm I get another forestallment and quitely snap. I say that I shoudl've gone to his sister at 8PM to get the subs and now it's too late to get them tonight. **He goes ""ahh, you're doing it again, stressing me out."" To which I respond, ""you're stressing me out.""** 

Honestly, every time I need to get subs in a timely manner through Cliff I always get screwed. Like when I was robbed two weeks ago (which turned out to be an impromptu loan) or any other time that I posted about such woes.


&nbsp;


Cliff warns me about his sister, ""don't give her money ahead of time."" In reality, she's proven to be honorable whenever I hand her money. Him on the other hand, often a story or an excuse when I don't get cash back that he was given for a deisgnated purpose. At present he's sitting on $40 for subs that he may or may not need. He even showed me the money the other day to prove he didn't spend it but for all I know that's the money he's holding to buy pills for his lady friend/client.


&nbsp;

**Phase 3:**


Well, I go to work in the early stages of WD on Sunday. Throughout the work day I'm checking if the pill guy showed up yet so that the girl with the subs would show up. Ultmately I'm given the option to come back to our 'hood on my lunch break for two tiny bumps of H. It took away the chills for a short while and made it easier for me to push through the remainder of my shift.


Cliff's sister couldn't get subs all day on Sunday. **At 10PM his sister texts me saying that she can get subs in the morning on Monday.** Cliff on the other hand says he's seeing his pill guy at 5AM. Cliff never sees his pill guy until afternoon and now the pill guy has to reup before he can make the trade with his lady friend for subs.


&nbsp;

**Phase 4:**

Anyway, after freezing and sweating in my bed and after my last brief stint of sleep I emerge a little before 11AM. I text Cliff's sister at that time and she responds immediately that she got them!


So Cliff is 2/10 and his sister is 4/4 when it comes to procuring subs without complications.


Funny thing is that Cliff makes it like his sister is the most evil thief of a cunt but she has never screwed me over. On the other hand Cliff once stole his sister's prescribed perc 10's when she dropped them on the floor so go figure. She doesn't annoy me as long as I keep my word about coming through to help fix her computer when requested.


She smokes dust to unwind at times but keeps her word. One time she needed help with her computer after I worked for 12 hours and kept bringing up the fact that she helped me with subs the week earlier.

After that we had a talk and arrived at an understanding. I'll help her with her computer and she won't mention she gets me subs in front of her brother ever again. This isn't always important since I sometimes share but sometimes I rather keep extra subs to myself since Cliff's word is worth shit. 


&nbsp;

The current policy has already served me well. I bought two subs the week before Thanksgiving and Black Friday (14+ hours of work in retail) and didn't share any with Cliff. If I did share with Cliff and counted on him to get subs in the middle of the week, I probably would've gone to work feelign sickly.


&nbsp;


Take-aways:


* Cliff always runs into complications that ""are not his fault"" when being depended upon to get subs.


* Clff's sister always keeps her word. When circumstances beyond her control get in the way, I know she's not making that shit up.


* Although Cliff's sister got two subs, I told Cliff she could only get one and split that one with him. He didn't even need it after getting pills today anyway! (he middled for another person altogether)


* I shoudln't have given him even half a sub. He's getting more tonight anyway as part of revised plans. (yeah, right).

* Seriously, about the previous bullet point: He says his pill connect is coming within the hour and the girl he's middling for will come by at the same time.


* I'm never going to give money to Cliff ever again for subs. Ever. Too complex, too stressful. Way easier to go through his sister. 


* I can buy 8 subs through his sister next week, give 2 to Cliff and I'll still be good through Christmas.


&nbsp;


Lastly, if I had a dime every time Cliff said ""within the hour"" or ""soon"" I'd have a few bucks. I think he'd rather be high than well to the point that he's only interested in getting subs when he's sick for two days and has no other options. I'm glad I hedged my bets and had enough extra cash to myself to buy subs on my own.



The bottom line --- NEVER count on Cliff to get subs. 


P.S.- When I went to get those bumps on my lunch break, I walked into a friend of a friend whom I thought sold dope. Spent $20 on him too and ended up with a twenty bag of crack. Thought it was dope so snorted it. When my throat got numb, I figured it must be coke so I snorted the rest of it but it didn't have the same effect. Oh well, at least I've still never smoked crack.",1512430999.0

i’ve been using a heroin/fent mix for a year now and would get sick after 10 hours. 

I’m currently nearly 48 hours with no gear and nothing. I’m about to reup once again so i’ll never truly know what happens at the 3/4 day mark, maybe that’s when the sickness hits me, but i’m very confused on a scientific basis.

One thing i need to mention that has to be related - - As well as this, i’ve been getting very much **LESS high** since nodding out harder than ever a month back...

I came back to this fent mix after a break and it rocked me very hard nearly into OD territory... since then, i’ve barely been able to shrink my pupils back down, very poor high. I’ve attributed this purely to tolerance because what else?

Could someone please try to help me with my situation, doctors are stumped","So I have chronic migraines and chronic daily headaches. I was warned a couple years ago to stay away from opiates because they could trigger even worse rebound headaches, but of course I didn't listen and abused opiates to treat the pain. These triggered horrifically painful chronic headaches, which I got sort-of under control with topamax, but they still hurt.

I was put on suboxone for cravings. I had reservations-- If opiates gave me rebound headaches, wouldn't subs? Doctor suggested I just try it. So he put me on 12 mg of subs, which is a hell of a lot more than the equivalent of what I was using before.

Well, surprise surprise, a week and a half after starting subs I get the worst level of headaches that I possibly have. I call them ""life or death"" headaches because the pain is so extreme that I become incoherent and have attempted suicide before. These migraines are absolutely no joke. It's all consuming, transcendent pain. I can't even offer a reasonable description.

This severe headache lasted three days, during which time I was unable to eat or sleep. 

This pattern of a life or death headache returning every week or sometimes twice a week recurred. I begged my neurologist to increase my topamax, which helped a little, but I was still in great pain every week.

After two months of putting up with this senseless horror, I cut myself off suboxone cold turkey at very beginning of November.

I'm about four weeks out of no suboxone, and while I have consumed some kratom, I am *still* having these awful rebound headaches. 

Are there any migraineurs here in r/opiates who might have some thoughts? How much longer will I have to wait to for the headaches to settle down? The last time I consumed any opiate was kratom last Tuesday, so I'm about a week clean of everything.",1512410801.0

Came out the hospital Sunday morning from heroin overdose. It was absolutely terrifying.,"Man, I feel like total shit. Let me tell you, that was the scariest fucking experience of my life. God damn.

Well here's the story. I wanted to die. I felt I had no purpose in life, I got kicked out of my drug rehab program because of bad attendance, I can't find a job to save my life, and I live in my moms house who resents me completely and can't wait to kick me out. I'm 20 years old by the way.

So I gathered up money I've been saving and went to my dealer to get a bun. But the thing is, I wasn't buying it to get high. I was buying it to overdose. I wanted to die a peaceful death and away from this misery. 

I came back a bit late and my mom just told me to sleep outside because I came home 20 minutes after her bedtime. I said please please let me in. But nope all she gave me was a glass of water she left in the backyard. I thought okay, perfect. Its better I die away from my family to risk scarring them. I would go and die peacefully in some empty park late at night.

I can't see worth shit and I couldnt risk the wind sweeping away my dope, so I went to a lower level of the backyard where there was a table and where the fences were high enough to protect the dope from sweeping away.

I poured out a fat ass little mountain of dope (basically my whole bun) and rolled up a paper from my book bag so I could sniff it (I didn't have any straws). Next thing I know I dived my nose in that dopey mountain of heaven and sniffed away. I sniffed and sniffed until it was all gone and I felt the nice bitter drip down my throat.

I then decided to walk away from my house and into the night and wander till the high slowly got stronger, and man did it get strong.

I went to my friends house and by then I was fucking high as shit, but I was terrified at the same time because in my mind I knew I was going to die. That this high was my free express trip to the underworld. 

I went to my friends house and asked him for water (yeah makes a lot of sense right? I'm willingly dying and still I want water) he gets me a cup and let's me sit on his porch when I tell him what happened and that I was about to die.

Then he says... ""So you don't even bless me up with a free bag"" he got angry cause I didn't save one bag for him and then he tells me to get the fuck out his house and goes back in leaving me sitting on his porch. He comes back 2 minutes later angrier with his fists up and starting cursing at me to get the fuck out of his house and calls me a junkie.

I then stumbled and left and back to wandering the night alone, the higher getting ever stronger that I could barely function walking normally.

I went to some guy in a deli and asked for a free cup of water (again with the water... I don't know what I was thinking maybe I was actually scared of death at this point) and he said for me to get lost.

I then went to this gas station market thing and asked for water and he gave it to me nicely. I drank it and mumbled thank you and left.

By then my plan was to go to the park about 10 minutes away and just sleep on the bench and not wake up again. 

The higher was not even at its peak and even then I was really getting terrified but relaxed at the same time. Its like my mind was screaming for help, and my body was just a malfunctioning robot. I was losing my body.


I approached the park where I crossed this man cleaning up in front of his shop, when he greets me nicely and I ignore him. He then calls out to me and asks me if I was okay and if I needed an ambulance. I then tried to puke but nothing but spit came out. He then told me he was going to call an ambulance and he waited outside with me holding me telling me I was going to be alright.


The ambulance came quick as fuck and I immediately asked if I was going to jail. They told me no and moved me slowly to the bed in the ambulance. They were nice but at this point I was so fucking high I couldn't really talk good or even breath good. They gave me an oxygen tube thing that went to my nose and I don't really remember but the lady had a nice casual conversation with me... Acting like I was a toddler. She smiled at me and treated me like I just won the spelling bee every time I responded to a question.

We went to the hospital I was on the bed and.. I was crying at this point and asked to call my dad. He came in and saw me and was crushed at the sight of me. As soon as he found out it was a heroin overdose and then left.

Then the scary fucking part happened. It was like nothing I experienced before. I don't know what happened. Its like the next thing I know I was SURROUNDED by doctors and I heard my heart monitor going crazy. But it was all so surreal. I really felt like.. I was in small box or something. Its hard to explain. My doctor was telling me to calm down and to breath. 

Later I found out my heart stopped and they said it was the medication kicking in... I asked them if I didn't go to a hospital if I would have died... They said yes, I would have died. I almost fucking died IN the hospital.

I laid there looking at my heart moniter...anxious whnever I started hearing it out abornally. I was so fucking scared.

I also pissed my pants without knowng it and they gave me an adult diaper... yeah. I woke up the next morning not being ale to move my legs, and could barely squeeze out any piss when I finaly made it to the bathroom.

My mom came worried and stayed with me and I just talked to her about what happened... and anyways I was discharged.  I came home and lad in bed and had the most weirdest fucking dreams. 

Scary as hell. Right now I kinda wish I did die, because I feel even more worthless then I did a week ago, now I just feel less alive. My body is still weird and my chest hurts. Did I mention I threw like a motherfucker in the hospital? Yeah what did I expect, right? Anyways thanks for readinng. Just wanted to share.",1512410637.0

I haven't come around in a while, but my entire heroin-worshipping life just changed from such a simple trick that I HAD to share for anyone else who loves banging but struggles to hit.

My veins have always been horrible; even as a child, nurses and phlebotomists would have to work really hard to find one for blood tests. Fast forward to opiates, and I would watch an ex-bf with glorious veins register with such ease and feel SO FUCKING ENVIOUS because he had to dig in my arms forever to get me and I could NEVER hit when I tried on my own.

Since my semi-recent relapse, I've mostly just been snorting a ton trying to get to that place we all love, but then my absolute favorite all-star dboy got outta jail and hooked me up with another client who said he'd help me out for a bag or two. Apparently dude is responsible for hitting a whole house full of junkies that live together and is just a vein whispering god or whatever.

So I show up and start tying off as hard as possible to try to facilitate the process, and he goes ""Nah I don't even need that."" Skeptical, I untied and stuck my forearm out. This guy turns out the lights, whips out a flashlight, slides it along my skin, and HOLY FUCKING SHIT my entire circulatory system was lit up like a neon roadmap to heroin oblivion. 

My jaw dropped. He tilted the light to see the rig a little and hit me right away in a huge vein running through a weird spot in my forearm (even in spite of the area being all scarred from cutting as a kid) and pushed off. Voilà.

Anyway maybe people already know, but I've been around for a while with lots of IV users who struggle and have never seen that, so I just wanted to share in case anyone finds it helpful! Obviously, a cell phone flashlight would be perfectly effective too.

Some of you guys know me and the story of what I have been going through and I just wanted to throw an update out there. I just did a couple years in the ole' jigga and am now out of there and in work release in a city I am not from. I have been waiting on a court order to get signed so that I can go home to house arrest and move on with my life and 35 days later it is finally signed!!!!

So, I have been up all night locked in work release getting fuckin' wrecked, doing oxymorphone and meth, when they come over the loudspeaker calling my name to come to main control...this is usually never a good thing. I get up there and they tell me that my case manager wants to meet with me right now. At about this point I am fucking trippin' because I am spun the fuck out and probably look like complete shit and I have to go meet with her. Note: she is a former heroin/meth addict herself and surely knows exactly what to look for. So I sit down in her office and she immediately tells me that my transfer order has been signed...and then her brow furrows. Uh-oh, I am absolutely fucked! She asks me if I am high right now and I was about to immediately respond, 'fuck no!' but then I got to thinking...I'm about to get dropped. So I go ahead and tell her that I relapsed and it was due to all of the stress and anxiety about getting out of prison and waiting on a tenuous transfer. You know what she did? She told me not to let it happen again and that I am better than that and to get out of her office.

This shit right here scared the living fuck out of me. I am going to be much, much, more careful in the decisions that I make in the near future and really evaluate whether or not I want to go straight back to fucking prison. I have already lost 5 of the last 6 years of my life to this same bullshit ass case. I am tired of wasting my life. I am not going to sit here and lie to you guys and say that I am 100% done with everything, just that I am going to be a lot more cognizant of the choices that I make. 

I am so glad to be back out and back here with you guys. I honestly thought about this subreddit a lot when I was in prison. That might sound fuckin' stupid, but it is the truth. This is the only place and y'all are the only people that I can talk to about this stuff and be completely honest.

UPDATE #2: I'm monitoring the situation closely, I'm personally packed and ready & so is the dog, right now I'm just hanging out trying to calm myself down. I put a bell on my pup along with his collar so if he hides I can find him. 

Might just throw the leash on him as a precautionary but I don't want him excited thinking he's going somewhere, he's already all kinds of nervous because I am. 

I have 2 suitcases & 4 small bags packed up and ordered by importance. If anything I can throw some of the small bags into the larger suitcase and downsize it but right now yah.

UPDATE #3: I PERSONALLY HAVE EVACUATED DOG AND MEDS IN HAND. MOMS PREPPING THE HOUSE IF THERES AN EVACUATION ORDER AND WILL LEAVE. THE SMOKE WAS WAY TOO HEAVY FOR ME AND I ALREADY HAVE A RESPITORY INFECTION.

**final update for Wednesday**: I am completely safe sound my parents have refused to leave. If the fire spreads overnight I will know about it I have friends on watch for me on the East Coast that will call me if conditions change.

then you need to continue taking it for another month or so as sort of microdosing to handle any residual PAWS.

I've been taking codeine, pretty much on a daily basis, for the past year and a half. This is my entire opiate journey so far, and believe me, I am very much aware I am a small fry by most comparisons lol. I take codeine usually before bed, or when I get home from work, and it'll be a dose between 450mg and 550mg, depending on what's available to me. I CWE co-codomol and I am based in the UK.

I understand the dangers behind opiates for sure, and although codeine is considered to be a weaker opiate, I do still suffer badly when I have to go without. 

I know it's a pretty whack question, but what now? I really enjoy the fuzzy high I get from codeine, and would love to be able to do something a little stronger and more readily available than having to order online or going to a pharmacy to buy several packs of co-codomol and do a CWE. All my local pharmacies are probably onto me now too. Not to mention downing a CWE is fucking disgusting lol.

I'm in the UK so I'm not sure what's actively available to me, either OTC, or on the street. I've asked about a bit, but dealers I use for my other pick-ups 'won't deal with opiates', and I don't wanna burn any bridges with them by pestering. I smoke weed daily and indulge in psychedelics too, and have been doing drugs generally coming up to 10 years now, so I'm definitely not inexperienced in that sense.

I started taking codeine legitimately for pain as directed - a few 8mg here and here - literally nothing. Worked my way up, and was soon drinking whole bottles of cough syrup. Now I CWE. But it's all just such a long winded process - either ordering and waiting, and paying a fortune for postage, or doing the extract - which is fine, but it does taste like shit, and my housemates hate having it in the freezer, or in labelled bottles in our fridge. My GP is out of the question unfortunately too as they are aware of my involvement with drugs due to an unrelated incident a few years ago.

Any advice, I'd be happy to take it. Cheers guys x",1512560605.0

It didnt last a week, I would say what I got may have been cut but I doubt it, big time chinese RC vendor from DNMs.  I'd say its 20% as strong as Fent HCl which I have gotten before but is super expensive now.  Anyway, smoking it off foil gives a fleeting rush with warmth comparable to some fat rips of #3 heroin, but it lasts like minutes while the respiratory depression and slurred speech last about 2-3 hours.  I snorted some and got longer effectss but it is IMO a shitty fentalogue, I thought acetyl-Fentanyl and Butyr-Fentanyl were much better.  I am trying 5 G of something new this week to review.

So my point is MAF is less potent than straight F HCl, similar duration, almost no euphoria, and leads to urge to redose.  I tapered off doing the 2gs straight non stop for a few days with 3,5 of brown heroin tapering down and diphenoxylate, tramadol, and atarax.

Anyone else have much experience with MAF? What are your favorite analogues?  Any good long duration ones? Im considering ordering lofentanil but the potency will make it difficult to dose with my equipment since it is stronger than carfent allegedly.

I feel more grateful that I survived now than I do angry or terrified. When I first woke up in the hospital after I had been given Narcan I was foggy, I did not fully understand how close I was to death until like 24 hours later, my thought process just wasn’t working. 

I woke up and snorted another bump of whatever I had WHILE I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL BED as I had hid the baggie in my sock before I overdosed. I didn’t understand how stupid that was until after I realized how close to death I was.

**Tinychat can be VERY shitty about the mobile app so if you can connect with a computer, that is the best option.**  
firstly, this chat is not affiliated with this subreddit or its moderators, and has its own moderators, rules, and etiquette. if you feel someone there has slighted you take it up with the moderators of tinychat, as it is completely unaffiliated with and not endorsed by this or any other subreddit.  
just a reminder and an announcement that a bunch of your fellow degenerate junkies, chippers, and tourists hang out in [our very own tinychat room](http://tinychat.com/ropiatesubchat) which has been an ongoing tradition for something like four years now. the location, for those who can't do links for whatever reason, is http://tinychat.com/ropiatesubchat.  

tinychat is an extremely buggy videochat client, but also the only one that fills its particular niche---that being, anyone who knows the room name may enter, and it has a youtube player. any technical difficulties may be addressed by the moderator, namely me. we like to hang out, listen to music, talk about random shit, and lately have even had our own resident sketch artist who draws random crap upon request. the primary purposes for the room's existence are companionship and harm reduction---it's nice to be able to shoot up with others around, even if you are technically alone in the non-digital sense, and have people keeping an eye on you. we're also glad to help with any problems you might be having, or questions you might need answered. we aim to be a welcoming, friendly space for the members of this subreddit to do what we do in good company without judgement. so stop by if you are bored, or just need to talk.  

if it appears like there is a moderator in the room but who is not speaking, just type a few sentences to summon them back. if you are on mobile it is not immediately apparent that there is anyone in the room. either click the button shaped like an outline of a person (i think) to see the list, or say hello to see if anyone responds.  


rules:  

1. pick a unique username. this is to protect other users so we know who is who, given the nature of the sort of activities we enjoy. 

2. no lurking. again, to protect the other users. if you come in the room be prepared to introduce yourself and participate for at least a few minutes so we know you're not up to any shenanigans. if you are lurking you will be warned and then given a generous ten minutes to announce yourself. if the time runs out, you will be kicked (not banned) until you are ready to come in and actually participate. if you are a known member whose identity can be confirmed, this rule is not applicable.  

3. no -isms or hate speech, even accidental. one warning will be issued, any continued insistence on such behavior will result in a ban. bans can be contested by pm'ing a moderator (me). this includes but is not limited to racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia. for example, if you are not black, use of the n-word, even with the -a ending, will not be tolerated. i don't care if your friend down the block lets you say it, it's not your lane. 

4. no auditory fuckery. due to peculiarities of the transmission of sound over a chat, certain echos and effects can be amplified to the point of being severely distressing. if it is determined that your end is causing an echo you will be asked to use headphones, or to mute your microphone when not speaking. deliberately making strange or unpleasant noises to annoy other chatters will not be tolerated, and your broadcast will be closed. (this only means that your video/audio feed will be terminated--you will still be allowed to type.)  

i know the rules seem like a lot but there's really only four of them, and only two that pertain to just behaving in a manner that isn't dickish.

So before you considering saying something rude and/or irrelevant to the advice I'm reaching out for, how about you just not waste your time (or mine, or the other redditors) and go find something you're actually interested in, to comment on. So just stay away if that's you.Now onto the actual post! Had to clear that up for the people who insist on sticking their nose where it doesn't belong. A friend of mine (is actually a friend, not me. Otherwise I wouldn't be able to so coherently type out this post)  IV'd this white powder he got and it made him act a bit crazy. It was supposed to be some east coast powder, like the usual that he'd receive from the plug. But this time, it was different... We split the shot, he gave me about 10 units more than himself, and we each did our thing. He IV's, I IM. He does his and for a moment still seems the same, I do mine and wait the 5 or so minutes it takes to come on. Once the substance hits his bloodstream, his behavior quickly changes to an erratic mess and as if he's no longer in control of himself. He starts moving about all absurd-like, flailing his limbs all over, begins rambling about complete nonsense that is either from the past or just completely irrelevant to what's happening this moment. He stretches his arms out in ways that look uncomfortable and possibly painful. Then begins rolling around on the bed, flopping his legs as if he's a fish out of water, and then rolls into the bedside table with a lamp atop. I calmly tell him that he should try relaxing and take a couple deep breaths, that he doesn't need to continue moving his body that way. But he doesn't seem to notice that he's acting in this weird say, even though I'm telling him that he's acting strange and trying to get him to just lay in his bed. Of course he refuses to attempt lying still on his bed, he feels as if he has to let his body move as freely as his brain tells him to. And I can assure you that he was not purposely moving about, considering he accidentally elbowed me in the shoulder and immediately started apologizing over and over. He's rambling on about random topics, sometimes recalling a period in time, or thinking he's dreaming and random thoughts pool into his brain. A couple of times, he brings up people I've never met and sometimes even refers to me as one of those people, forgetting that we're just sitting in his room alone. The things he says, leave me clueless as to what he's talking about, having no clue where he could have gotten these crazy thoughts from. It's really tripping me out. Even weirder, I muscle my stuff and it didn't effect me in any way. But he's apparently getting whatever this drug's full effects are. Sorry for the long ass novel, but does anyone have any thought as to what he and I have just put into our bodies? I dont need anyone telling me that I'm an idiot for putting something in my body that I'm unsure of; every other time we have gotten from this person, nothing like this has ever happened. I also don't need someone telling me that I'm a useless junkie or trying to shame me for the choices I've made. I'm simply posting this, hoping someone can give some insight as to what's going on here. It's plain, white powder. Like always.",1512532361.0

That's the future of Suboxone (and every other opioid).

I guess it would be a step forward if addicts are no longer jailed, but make no mistake, if you have a ""brain disease"" especially an ""incurable"" one, society will discriminate against you.  

They'll make sure we're still monitored like any other undesirables.  

God help you if you need opioids for pain control.

EDIT:  More and more, I feel like addiction is a disease if all of society comes to a consensus and defines it as one.  I'm not very comfortable with that prospect because people with mental illnesses in a lot of societies (including American society for sure) are treated like crap.

I'm pretty sure they have the same formulation since they're both made by Purdue Pharma and the time release is defeated through similar ways. I acquired a bunch for really cheap due to the tediousness of defeating the time release mechanism and I found the Coca Cola method to be the best way to do it without microwaving them and doing some ""kitchen chemistry"" stuff on them but after soaking 2 of them in Coca Cola for approximately 17 hours, I was really surprised by how much they swelled up and by how gelatinous they became, I knew they did that but how big they got surprised me. o.O 

My friends that used these, reported a lot of nausea compared to normal oxycodone and after seeing how they possibly work in the stomach i'm not surprised by this at all, I didn't get sick after consuming the Coca Cola solution and the gelatinous tablets to get all 40 milligrams and it worked fine I didn't feel nauseous at all although I didn't eat anything at all that day, I also took 1050 milligrams of Carisoprodol (Soma) and snorted 12.5 milligrams of Unisom containing the antihistamine Doxylamine and that was a great combo for the books and it was probably the most fun I've had in awhile, aside from the week before that I smoked some PCP and did a bump of ketamine on top of that which was also alot of fun lol. The only problem I experienced with them was I woke up at 4:00 in the morning and had really really painful constipation that felt like I was being disemboweled, I know opioids cause constipation but this was different and I'm thinking the gel and other inactive ingredients are to blame for this.

They need to stop making these weird space age formulations because of the possible dangers of the inactive ingredients and ect.  I'm pretty sure they had to take the space age Opana off the market because IV users got Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura so who really knows all the dangers that these new ""safer"" space age formulations can do regardless of the route of administration.

I apologize in advance if my thoughts on the matter seem really scattered my psychiatrist put me on the mood stabilizer Lamotrigine (Lamictal) and it's made thinking clearly a lot harder. -.-    

Edit: I believe I forgot the image I was trying to show people what they look like after the Coca Cola method.

Need advice,"Hey guys, so the universe played a fucking joke on me, and I'll get to that in a little bit...

I've been abusing opioids on and off for about three years now (way longer if you count simple recreational use, but I'm talking about addiction here), everything from kratom to fentanyl. Recently, I hit my rock bottom and spent two months detoxing from opium/morphine and FINALLY started to feel happy and productive again. I had hope, I was going to stay clean for real this time and really did and still do want to. I'm so fucking tired of opioids, truly done with them. 

Here's where the joke comes in. Literally within a few days of starting to feel good, productive, CLEAN- I shattered my fucking kneecap! Along with many other more minor (but still very painful) injuries. I already had chronic issues with that knee so basically, I'm fucked. I can't walk or really move at all. I have no choice but to be on pain meds for what will likely be months, seeing as I need surgery and all that. And I still might face chronic pain after the injury heals, I don't know yet. But for the time being, I have no choice but to get back on opioids (at least they're legal this time) for several months, which with my addiction history, is really not a good thing. 

I've talked about it with my parents, who know all about my addiction issues and are supportive of me currently being back on opies because the pain is 10/10, and they know it, and they agreed that it's more important right now for me to be able to function and hold some type of a job soon by any means necessary, contingent on the fact that once the injuries get better, I will go to some form of rehab (which I am more than willing to). 

However, I feel completely defeated. I finally beat the bullshit psychological addiction and *of course* right when I did, I had to be hit with a seriously painful and disabling injury. Fml, right? I know that months of (even rx) opioid use will lead me down a very bad road, and I've been trying for YEARS to avoid long-term suboxone, having read all the horror stories, but now I don't know. I don't want to go on it, but at the same time I feel it may be my best chance once I get through this. 

My main concern is that I DO NOT want long-term suboxone unless (and I'm crossing my fingers that this will not be the case) I am left with serious chronic pain even after the injury heals, which unfortunately there is a good chance of (in addition to shattering my kneecap, I also have a severe sprain and my cartilage is pretty much obliterated-my knee is busted to bits in other words). I'm hoping for a rapid taper on subs, which I *have* successfully done before on my own, but I know that many rehabs like to keep you on subs for a while, especially if you've been using opioids for years. 

I'm sorry for the novel, so here's a tl;dr:

SUBOXONE USERS: Would you recommend that someone with a very serious and painful injury plus years of addiction history try to go the suboxone route, or tough it out? What has been most successful *for you*? While I'm talking to all suboxone users, current and prior, I especially would love to hear from the ones that are dealing with both addiction and chronic pain. 

Right now, I am in the mindset that I DO NOT want to be on opioids other than for pain relief, but I'm terrified that after months of using again (which is pretty much inevitable at this point), I *will* slip back into the addict mindset and fuck my life up all over again.

After half a decade of heroin, and then the last year on subs more or less, I'm perfectly aware of the effect opioid addiction has on your natural hormone levels. Mostly that it tanks them, both times I went to rehab my testosterone levels were in the toddler or geriatric man ranges... So that never really bothered me in and of itself, where I do have concern now, is how being on suboxone (or physically addicted to any opioid) would alter the effectiveness of orally administered hormone replacement therapy, specifically estrogen being taken for the purpose of physically transitioning from male to female?

I don't know if opioids block hormone production or block their receptors, or how either of those effects would affect my response to the estrogen. I know the spironolactone that is almost always prescribed with estrogen to trans-women, blocks my natural production of testosterone, much like opioid addiction, so my thought would be that it's all fine, but again I don't know much about the endocrine system or the chemical mechanisms of action, within it, so I really just don't know... 

So I'd really like to hear from any other trans folk who may have experience with this situation, or anyone with a solid medical understanding of these concepts in relation to transitioning...",1512490644.0

He fronts me out a couple hundred, which I ALWAYS pay back on time, and is almost always on.  Lately he won't put me out on front and last night I went to buy some weed from him and he told me most of his connects can't get pills from their PC physician anymore and are having to go to pain management so shits gonna be dry and expensive when it's there (like all of a sudden out of the blue this happens to several of his connects??).  

Thing is, this dude is like truly a pretty good dude.  I know what you're thinking bc I think the same thing everytime I see someone say that on here..  he's a dboy.. he's just making you feel that way bc you're feeding him that $$$$!!  But this dude volunteers to ref kids' football games, gives free haircuts to local kids, drives all over the place to attend his nephew's football games, does work on elderly folk's homes for free, like I really believe he's a good dude, he just sells a lot of pills, which is obviously bad.  He's very polite, non-confrontational, and professional.  Honestly the best plug I've ever had by a long shot.  It took me a good minute of going through a middle before I finally got his number too.

Anyways, he came by my house for the first time the other day and met my kid and ever since he has been no good.  I've been going to him for almost a year and even tho I never say anything to him about trying to quit I'm sure he sees the struggle and I honestly think he is cutting me off for my own good.  I would typically spend at least $500 a week with him so it definitely is NOT in his best interest to cut me off.  I can't imagine there being anyone in our small town that runs more money through him than I do.  I don't know how to feel about this though...  First off, it makes me feel like a little bitch bc another man is making decisions based on what's best for my family.  The only reason that stings so bad is bc he is right!  Like damn, he's looking out for my family more than I am, wtf.  

I don't know what I'm looking for here but it's just a weird situation and I don't know how I feel about it.  I haven't used since Saturday morning and I'm feeling okay but I've been here MANY times before and I always give in.  Wish me luck I guess.",1512659929.0

---

First let me tell you a little bit about myself and how I know the tricks of the trade when it comes to the subject of using kratom to get off opiates.

I suffer from Fibromyalgia and I have been on and off opiates for almost 13 years. Before I found kratom, I would suffer terrible withdrawal needlessly. With Kratom as a tool and trial and error, I am now so comfortable coming off opiates that **I don't worry AT ALL about withdrawals**. I know exactly what to expect and the only negative effects that I have are the first 3 days having low energy. **I have done this over 30 times** I have been wanting to write this guide for a long time and now I am extremely confident in the entire process that I am ready to share it with you. My greatest wish is that this guide will help you though a time that would have been a living hell, and turn it into a great experience. I hope to help make your transition as seamless as possible.
 
So, if you are wanting to quit opiates, this is the guide for you.

The most important supplements on the list are 1, 6, 11 and 8 in that order.

If you cannot afford all of the supplements you might want to think about saving up. This process is 99% mental. If you follow this guide, Kratom and the supplements will do the vast majority of the work and all the heavy lifting. What you need to really focus on is keeping your mind occupied.

If you have access to a Doctor and can get hold of some, you will **tremendously** benefit from [Clonidine](https://www.drugs.com/comments/clonidine/catapres-for-opiate-withdrawal.html)

---

##PART2

**KRATOM SUPPLY edited for r/opiates**

**This is going to be the most subjective part of the process.**

What you are going to need

* Red Strain 1 ~ 125-250 Grams
* Red Strain 2 ~ 125-250 Grams
* Green Strain 3 ~ 125-250 Grams
* Green Strain 4 ~ 125-250 Grams

If you want to do 8 strains this would be even better 4 reds and 4 greens. The reason for this is because you want to be able to (most importantly) find (at the very least) one good red that works for you and one good green that works for you and be able to rotate strains.

---

##PART3

**The 7 P's**

***Proper Prior Planning Prevents Piss Poor Performance***

**Part 3a Create Some Time**

If you are working during this process, plan on using your weekend. I would suggest that you have at least 3 days off in a row with no plans. If you have a good relationship with your work, talk to your boss. Make and excuse? You know whats best here.

If you can take a week off (7 consecutive days) that is perfect. The more the merrier. If you can only do 2, we can work around that, but be forewarned, you are probably not going to have much energy on the third day.

**Part 3b Relaxing Entertainment.**

You are now going to plan ahead. Before you begin the process, go onto one of those sites and make a watchlist. I highly recommend keeping things light; Comedy's, Binge watch a TV series, pick out a few casual games that are not very stressful. If you don't have access to the internet on your TV, get a line up of movies. If you have a DVR, go search through the movie channels or nature channels and record yourself a good line up.

Get some music lined up that is positive and upbeat. Make a list. Get some writing materials together because you are going to be keeping a journal when you start.

If you have a laptop make a spot where you can lay in bed and watch as well.

**Part 3c Transition Space**

The objective here is to clean up your apartment, house or bedroom. Whatever you have. Do your laundry and make sure you have plenty of clean clothes, because you are not going to be doing much of anything more than relaxing and viewing your entertainment.

You are also going to be taking a lot of showers during this time as well. If you have a hot tub, pool or bath make sure everything is ready to go.

**Part 3d Groceries**

You might want to plan on getting use to not eating breakfast for a few days before you put the guide to work. After a few days your body will get use to it. [Ghrelin and Leptin](http://www.webmd.com/diet/features/your-hunger-hormones#1) are very adaptive hormones.

Personally, I fast during the first 3 days, but I wouldn't recommend it. I might have some avocados a few hours before my last dose of the day.

Get some comfort food. You are going to want to be on a [ketogenic diet](https://ketodietapp.com/Blog/post/2015/01/03/Keto-Diet-Food-List-What-to-Eat-and-Avoid) for at least the first 3 days longer is better. You are going to want to do as little cooking as possible during the first 3 days. You have more important things to do like watch all the Rick and Morty's etc.

One of my favorite things to do is hard boil a bunch of eggs before and have them in the fridge. Get a bunch of avocado's make some guacamole and put lemon or lime juice on the top to keep it fresh or just eat the avocados plain.Cottage cheese 4% nothing low fat. Do you like nuts? Those are good too. The ketogenic diet link should give you some good ideas on what you should be eating.

The one desert that you can and SHOULD eat is [**Dark Chocolate**](https://opiateaddictionsupport.com/dark-chocolate-is-amazing-for-opiate-addiction-recovery/) 70% or higher.

Again, you are not going to be eating in the morning until you find your dosage sweet spot.

**Part 3e Leave your schedule open, but make one**

Get yourself a notebook and a pen. You are going to be using this to take notes, but also to remind yourself what you have planned. Which isn't much. You are going to take at least 3 showers a day. Start a journal to keep track of you dosage.

Also, it might be a good idea to write yourself a note about why you are quitting opiates. Make a list of things that you want to do that you weren't able to do because of opiates. If you are artistic draw something if you get bored of watching movies and such.

Ok, go through your checklist and make sure you have everything you need. No plans. No need to go anywhere. **Are you ready?**

---

##PART4

**I want to add a disclaimer here. These doses are highly subjective and depends on; how long you have been taking opiates, your physiology, what your stomach can take, what level of comfort are you looking for.**

**Let us Guesstimate**

One thing to remember with Kratom you can always take more, but you cant take less. If you take too much you will get nauseous, dizzy, eye wobbles and general malaise. We will discuss how to deal with that a little later.  

If you weigh in between a set add .5 so if you are 250 lbs that would be 7.5 grams

|Weight(lbs)| Kratom (g)| Female 
|- | :-: | :-:
|   <100  | 4 | -1
|100-150| 5 | -1
|150-200| 6 | -1
|200-250| 7 | -1
|250-300| 8 | -1
|300-350| 9 | -1
|350-400|10 | -1

|Opiate|Daily Dose|Add 1g
|-  | :-: | :-:
|Hydromorphone|  >30mg  | +1
|Buprenorphine|  >4mg  | +1
|Oxycodone|  >80mg  | +1
|Morphine|  >140mg  | +1
|Tramadol|  >800mg  | +1
|Codeine|  >400mg  | +1
|Hydrocodone|  >140mg  | +1
|Fentanyl|  >50mcg/hr  | +1
|Heroin|  >2g  |+1
|Methadone|  >18mg  | +1
|Oxymorphone|  >80mg  | +1
|SUfentanil|  >110mcg  | +1

Question : A female weighs 125 pounds and takes 160mgs of Oxycodone a day. How many grams of Kratom does she start off taking?

Answer : [Grams?](#s ""5 grams"")

---

##Part5

**Prepping for your first day**

So, now you know how many grams you are going to start out taking lets talk about preparation for your first day.

So, this is the night before you drop opiates. I want you to time out your last dose so that when you wake up you will either be in full or partial withdrawal.

Before you go to bed I want you to
 
1. Weigh out however many grams your dose is in one of the Red Strains. Use the measuring cup for a bottle of cough syrup.
2. Get all of your supplements ready. You want to read the directions for each of them and follow the recommend dose.
3. You are going to take all the supplements except **Theanine Serene with Relora, Valerian Root, Kava Kava and Zipfizz**
4. If you have your shaker bottle put it next to your supplements and Kratom. If you didn't get the shake bottle, get a 32oz gatorade bottle at the store. Whatever bottle it is make sure it has a wide mouth.
5. I want you to take this time to start your journal for the morning.
6. Write down your initial dose, when you wake up you can note the time that you take it
7. Make sure you have everything in the same place ready to go, don't forget the ginger.

Get some sleep and I will see you in the morning.

---

##Part6

**Your Journey Begins**


* I am not going to mention it, but you need to keep yourself hydrated throughout all of this.
* Remember to skip breakfast and dont eat after your dose.
* Remember to take three showers a day. You will understand when you get there.
* If at anytime you feel like you are going to be sick to your stomach eat bread or some other starchy carbohydrate. You will have to dose again after just make sure you take a little less.

OK! Rise and shine get your shaker bottle and head to the sink. pour the kratom in first.

Now I want you to run the water until you get it to a temperature where it is almost too hot to touch.

Fill the bottle about half way with the hot water, put the lid on and shake. If the bottle is clear you should be able to notice when there are no more particles sticking to the plastic.

There will be foam in there, but dont worry. Turn the bottle up over your face and start drinking fast.. You will notice that all of the foam has risen to the top and you are just getting ""instant Kratom tea"". When you get the the foam stop and put a little more water in and shake and repeat until its gone.

That wasn't so bad was it? Now Take your supplements that you had laid out the night before.

Note the time in your journal.

Pop a few of those candied ginger in your mouth.

Now take all of your clothes off. No, seriously. You are going to have a shower. Enjoy you shower and think about what you are going to do today. What movies do you have lined up?

Ok, now after you are done drying off head to the lounge area that you had prepped just for this occasion. Get a movie started. Have your journal ready.

When you start feeling anything I want you to pause the movie and write down all your observations. Mind the time.

Now 45 minuets have gone by, do you still feel withdrawals? If yes I want you to go back and take another gram and wait another 45 minuets. 

Chances are you are noticing that you are not high, but that you are not in withdrawals either minus being tired.

Watch your movie and try to realize how bad you would have been feeling right now had you not had any Kratom.

Chances are you are getting hungry by now. I want you to ignore it. Get into your movies.

After you are finished with a few movies you might feel the onset of withdrawals coming on. Once you are not able to be comfortable in your couch or your bed anymore its time to re-dose. Note the time.

I want you to keep in mind that Kratom is not an opiate. You are not supposed to be high right now. You are supposed to be comfortable.

When you are ready to starting to feel like re-dosing for the third time today, I want you to eat some fatty foods that you have already bought from the store. Soon after you are done eating you will have the urge to re-dose. I want you to wait 20 minutes to let the food start to digest.

After 20 minutes has gone by go ahead and dose again.

After you are back and starting to feel better again, you are probably going to start getting tired. Before you go down to sleep I want you to take the Valerian Root Extract and the Theanine Serene with Relora.

**If you have 3 days off I want you to do this same thing every day.**

Don't worry about keeping a regular schedule for now.

**If you have the whole week off**

If you have the whole week off there will come a time when you are feeling well enough to start getting up. You might even feel motivated to do something.

When this happens I want you to wake up and take the green in the morning instead of the red. Make sure you stay with the dose you first started out with if you had to add more grams. Wait 45 minuets and then re-dose if you have to.

You should notice a stark difference now that you are taking a green. You might want to stick with the red and if you do that is fine.

**If you had to go back to work on the 3rd or 4th day I want you to take a green when you wake up and make yourself a zipfizz**

Take a few doses of kratom to work with you along with your shaker and dose as needed. When you get home from work I want you to take some Kava Kava Extract.

Take a red and the Theanine serene before you go to bed. 

---

####Getting Out

**On the 4th day**

On the 4th day you may or may not notice that your energy is starting to return.  

I want you to take a walk on the 4th day. If you have work, you might have to wake up a little earlier. If that is the case, do it. **Don't skip this step.** Your body and mind might protest the thought of going outside and taking a walk or hike, but they don't know what is good for them at this point. 

I want you to wake up as you would normally. Do and repeat the steps that you have been doing for the last three days. **Make sure that you take a green strain**, but I want you to forget about taking a shower and put some clothes on.

Don't worry, you aren't going to run a marathon or swim the channel. The purpose of getting out is two fold. I want you to get a little exercise, but that is secondary to getting outside and communing with nature. You dont have to live in the country to do this.

If you live in a concrete jungle, I want you to try to find a quiet suburb or a park. I want you to find a place that has trees, flowers, animals,. running water etc. The place that you find should be missing one thing, people. or as little people as possible.

***Don't go to a gym.***

The ideal place would be some kind of hiking trail. Take along a camera if you like, but the point of this exercise is to get away from the house, technology and people. If you aren't in great shape, dont worry about it.

Spend a good 45 minuets to an hour outside walking around and enjoying the the sites, sounds and smells of the plant and animal world. If you are so inclined find a place to meditate and focus on all that nature has to offer you. When you get home, I want you to get in the shower or take a bath.

You can step up the physical exertion daily, but I dont want you to overexert yourself or engage in any activity that is going to cause you to be physically exhausted or sore. From now on you are going to do this everyday until you reach the end of this guide. 

**After about 7 to 10 days you might start to feel crappy again like you are going through withdrawals**

At this point you need to do something that doesn't seem like it makes sense, but you are going to need to cut your dose back. Cut it in half in the morning and do the whole wait 45 minuets again.

You might find that cutting it in half did the trick or you might find that you needed a few more grams than half your dose.

Once you are at this point you are through the gauntlet my friend.

**Time to tell Reddit about your journey at let us know how it went.** 

Of course I hope that you were in touch with everyone during your transition. Maybe make a post about your experience. I know I will be fascinated to hear about it. Are there any other bad habits that you dropped since starting Kratom?

Not a dboy was stirring, no texts saying ""All good""

The syringes were opened from the exchange with great care

In hopes that St Dopeman would soon be there

The junkies were restless, not snug in their beds

With visions of free grams danced in their heads

And my girl in her hoodie and I all in black

Had just paced around, no sleep nor a nap

And out on the stoop arouse such a clatter

I jumped up all sweaty to see what's the matter

Away to the window I flew like a flash

Tore open cheap blinds and threw up pop tarts real fast

The moon on the breast of the grey slushy snow

Gave the luster to garbage in the gutters below

When what to my watering eyes should appear

But a beat-up jalopy and eight tiny reindeer

A huge tatted black dude, with buns in both hands

I knew in a moment it 'twas the dopeman!

More rapid than tweakers the bricks they did came

And he coughed and he hollered and called them by name:

Buy Toxic, buy Monster, buy Poison and Dream Chaser! Buy Spider, buy Blue Star, Yeezy and Hell Raiser!

To the top of the cut, to the top of the hole

Now spend away, spend away, spend away your soul!

As empty dope baggies before the frenzy did fly

The fiends they came booking, looking to buy

So up to the dope spot the jalopy did roll

With bricks of straight fire, with St. Dopeman in tow

And then in a twinkling, I ran to the spot

No pigs were in sight, so the block was not hot

As I pulled out my money and glanced all around

Up the alley St. Dopeman came with a bound!

He was decked out in jewelry from his head to his foot

And his jordans brand new from just a quick look

A knapsack of dope was slung over his back

And he looked like a thug but don't mention that

His eyes: they were greedy, his fists oh so meaty

On his cheek tattooed a tear and his demeanor it was seedy

His large angry mouth always mumbled directions

And if you couldn't comprehend, he'd yell ""now you fucking listen!""

The stump of his backwoods  he held clenched in his teeth

And the smoke it encircled his dome like a wreath

He had a mean ugly mug and a little beer belly

That shook when he laughed while watching the telly 

He was hardened and harsh, a true typical hood

But I was psyched when I'd meet him, cause his gear was so good

A wink of his eye and a tip of his head

Soon gave me to know I'd be nodding in bed 

He spoke only ebonics, but went straight to his work

And handed out baggies and encouraged clean works

He'd give out fat bags when you'd be down in the dumps

And laying a pimp slap aside of the chumps

He sprung to his ride, to his crew gave a whistle

And away they all bounced, with a wave of their pistols

But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight-

Happy Junkmas to all, and to all a good night!

My sister wanted to get better more than anything, I know she wanted it so bad and even after being in and out of rehab, it’s like she just couldn’t. 

I don’t use drugs so it is hard for me to understand the mind of an addict. I guess I just am looking for some understanding on why she continued to use heroin, even after getting clean. She has looked at me in the face, crying her eyes out saying this isn’t what she wants for herself. Is heroin really that good that it’s worth risking your life on a daily basis for?

I used to get very concerned about my girlfriend taking different amounts of various benzos and opiates, especially mixing them with alcohol. But I gave up being concerned once I did more research (I was so naive to opiates and still am). She doesn't have a big enough problem to think she has a problem. The problem now mainly lies with both of us struggling to pay bills over pills.

However now I'm snorting a Roxy here or there and fantasizing about finding heroin and just becoming a junkie instead of offing myself. VERY stupid mindset, but hey, my brain isn't exactly perfect. But you can't use H casually, can you? I couldn't. I stayed away from coke because of my addictive personality but then I tried it and it made me broke. Too expensive.

But so are street pills. I really need to get out now because my mental health is brittle and I don't need yet another addiction... but I'm heading there. Please tell me your stories. Maybe they will give me pause or at least some perspective.

I do not list quantities Just giving an example for a specific reason.  no quantities or type of drug associated with the cost is listed.
@@I'll put @ on the paragraphs you don't need to really read.

@@@@@@Hello, Reddit.  Let me give you a backstory:
never considered myself truly addicted to drugs until late into opiate use. I never hit rock bottom, I was the lucky few that could manage it letting me get by but only barely comfortable.  I  had a fortunate upbringing and could have easily used my knowledge to be making $50k+, and $100k+ in the next 5 years.  I've had a professor say If I wasnt going downhill he could see me becoming a millionare by the time i'm 30, and If I shopped good have a million in the bank and a house and cars and a girl.  He knew I was on drugs, and was essentially saying I knew my shit to live good.

@TLDR I didn't listen to people saying shit I should have listened to. You know, addiction..  So I went downhill. ^^


The ""heroin"" is sold alongside regular H.  it is super hard to find here, where we are.  But pills are rising.  A $100 of chunk *(powder, brown chunky powder) is more cost efficient then pills
The Chunk is all SWIM uses.  But people buy the fent laced bags.  It is the same as the chunk, but cut down.  It's maybe 25% of that, then the rest is a mix that is not SUPER safe (again, I would take more precautions) but there is a lot of measures put in place.  Its a super pre cut mixture of fentanyl, but someone has gone to the hospital doing them recklessness and said the drs said is carefentanyl.  i was angry because my friend always knew exact dosages in the mixture.  Carefentanyl being different, was strange.

But people buy the stuff!! People die from fentanyl all the time.  There is tons of effort to make sure these are as safe as possible, and never sold as H.  They are under ""stamps"" that say death and even ones that say ""fent warning""
They're cheaper then the regular stuff, of course.  
I want to know what others think about this.  Knowing it's super dangerous, but people know what they are getting and have a proper alternative.  Fent is rampant in poorly cut competitors,  who lie about it. 

@@@@@@@Thats what everyone tells my friends/neighbor.  I've used them but they make me just sleep!  And I am trying to stay clean for a while.

So I made a more generic calculator to answer the question of how much drug is in your system after X hours, redosing every Y hours. The calculations are fairly accurate but may differ slightly person-to-person, etc.

Anyway, you can find the calculator here:

https://jsfiddle.net/rf9cLpqL/5/


Fill out the form on the right side, and press ""calculate!"" To calculate a per-hour average for a specified number of days out.

* **Active dose** (in mg) - Like for a 30mg oxy this would be 30mg. For heroin, you'll have to guess purity. DEA states that average black tar is around 20%, average ECP is around 45%. So if you want to use those averages, 100mg line of ECP you would enter ""45"" into this field.

* **Bioavailability** - This is given as a percentage of BA. You can generally find this on wiki or elsewhere. Wikipedia for heroin IN gives 44-61%. So the average here is (44 + 61) / 2 = 52.5. For heroin, IN thus you would enter ""52.5"" into this field.

* **Dose Interval** - This is the number of hours you redose. So if you redose every 8 hours, put ""8"" here. If you redose once a day, use ""24"". If you want to just calculate how quickly a drug will leave your system after a single use, use ""0""

* **Half Life** - This is the number of hours that is the biological half-life of the substance. Look up on wiki or elsewhere. So if a substance is listed as 4-5 hours half life, (4+5) / 2 = 4.5, I would put 4.5 into that field. Keep in mind wikipedia lists biological half life of heroin for 2-3 minutes, but this is because after 2-3 minutes your body converts it to 6-MAM or morphine. Biological half life for morphine is 2-3 hours, so to figure all the intermediates and stuff, you can assume 3. Elsewhere I've commonly seen 4 hours quoted for heroin.

* **Number of Days** - In this field, just put the number of days you want to calculate out. So if you do ""1"" day, it will calculate out 1 day of use, redosing every so-many hours that you specified earlier. This field only supports whole-numbers, so if you want to calculate like how long and how high after redosing every 3 hours for 12 hours, then enter ""1"" day here, scroll down to the results grab the ""Amount"" after 12 hours, and plug that back in to the top changing ""redose interval"" to 0.

After you fill out these fields, press the ""Calculate!"" button in that form to populate the table below.",1512623838.0

Queue all the “I never thought this would happen to me”. It’s not me, it’s my fiancé. He has a huge tolerance. Not shooters. He hasnt even nodded in a long time. We picked up a half tonight, just enough to get well. Our d boy calls saying he has something for us to try. We pull up, my fiancé goes inside. Its taking too long so I call. He says everything is ok, we’re gonna give some girl a ride a few streets over and get paid in product for doing it. This girl I don’t even know gets in my car and is rude as fuck. I ask her where my fiancé is and she doesn’t know, but says he better hurry his ass up. I call him but there’s no answer. She’s getting more and more unpleasant so I almost kick her out. He finally opens the door but he’s wobbly and asks where she is, I yell that she’s in the car and ask what the hell is wrong with him. He barely gets in the car and shuts his door. 

I can tell immediately he’s done too much of this tester. The girl starts saying he’s fine and let’s go. But he’s barely conscious. We start driving while I’m trying to keep him awake. Girl tells me that yesterday she only did half a cap of the shit he tested and she almost died, was knocked out for seven hours. I know he probably did two or three caps. I’m freaking out at this point because my phone doesn’t have data so I can’t GPS to the hospital. She’s telling me not to take him there but if I do hide his phone so her and her people don’t get busted. I pull over and tell her to get out of my car. Bye bitch.

He’s in and out of consciousness. I can’t take him home this way cause we live with my parents who have no clue. So I’m screaming at him, slapping him, pouring water on him. He wakes up once or twice to scream at me that he’s fine. I’m a hypocrite, etc. Then immediately unconscious again. I pull over because I’m shaking so hard I can’t drive. Try to wake him up but it’s not happening. So I call 911.

They get there and are taking their sweet freaking time. Another walk in the park for them. Gets two narcan up the nose. Nothing. Another cop opens my door and starts asking questions (name, DOB, address). How am I supposed to answer these questions right now are you kidding me? He won’t wake up. They ask me to step out of the car. Somehow or another there’s ten cops there just staring at me while only two work on him. Still not awake. I’m starting to freak out and get back in the car so I can talk to him. They start fluid, more narcan. Nothing. Everyone is just standing around watching. Why did they show up just to watch. Are they bored? No one is helping me. I’m on the ground having a panic attack.

He finally wakes up, barely. They ask what he took. Motherfucker is half conscious and has the god damn sense to say Benadryl. Cop starts laughing and responds, “Benadryl mixed with heroin?” He half consciously just says back, “Benadryl.”

They get him to half ass walk to the ambulance. Still no one talks to me, so I ask where to follow them and I leave. 

Currently sitting at the hospital cause they won’t let me back. It’s “procedure” and could be hours. 

I don’t know what to do. My parents are luckily in bed so I don’t have to fess up. My fiancé still has product in his pocket that I didn’t think to grab. Idk if they found it. 

How fucked up is it that I just want them to let me back so I can grab it? I never want another line ever again but somehow that’s all I can think of. This drug is so fucked up. . . I can’t.

**Tinychat can be VERY shitty about the mobile app so if you can connect with a computer, that is the best option.**  
firstly, this chat is not affiliated with this subreddit or its moderators, and has its own moderators, rules, and etiquette. if you feel someone there has slighted you take it up with the moderators of tinychat, as it is completely unaffiliated with and not endorsed by this or any other subreddit.  
just a reminder and an announcement that a bunch of your fellow degenerate junkies, chippers, and tourists hang out in [our very own tinychat room](http://tinychat.com/ropiatesubchat) which has been an ongoing tradition for something like four years now. the location, for those who can't do links for whatever reason, is http://tinychat.com/ropiatesubchat.  

tinychat is an extremely buggy videochat client, but also the only one that fills its particular niche---that being, anyone who knows the room name may enter, and it has a youtube player. any technical difficulties may be addressed by the moderator, namely me. we like to hang out, listen to music, talk about random shit, and lately have even had our own resident sketch artist who draws random crap upon request. the primary purposes for the room's existence are companionship and harm reduction---it's nice to be able to shoot up with others around, even if you are technically alone in the non-digital sense, and have people keeping an eye on you. we're also glad to help with any problems you might be having, or questions you might need answered. we aim to be a welcoming, friendly space for the members of this subreddit to do what we do in good company without judgement. so stop by if you are bored, or just need to talk.  

if it appears like there is a moderator in the room but who is not speaking, just type a few sentences to summon them back. if you are on mobile it is not immediately apparent that there is anyone in the room. either click the button shaped like an outline of a person (i think) to see the list, or say hello to see if anyone responds.  


rules:  

1. pick a unique username. this is to protect other users so we know who is who, given the nature of the sort of activities we enjoy. 

2. no lurking. again, to protect the other users. if you come in the room be prepared to introduce yourself and participate for at least a few minutes so we know you're not up to any shenanigans. if you are lurking you will be warned and then given a generous ten minutes to announce yourself. if the time runs out, you will be kicked (not banned) until you are ready to come in and actually participate. if you are a known member whose identity can be confirmed, this rule is not applicable.  

3. no -isms or hate speech, even accidental. one warning will be issued, any continued insistence on such behavior will result in a ban. bans can be contested by pm'ing a moderator (me). this includes but is not limited to racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia. for example, if you are not black, use of the n-word, even with the -a ending, will not be tolerated. i don't care if your friend down the block lets you say it, it's not your lane. 

4. no auditory fuckery. due to peculiarities of the transmission of sound over a chat, certain echos and effects can be amplified to the point of being severely distressing. if it is determined that your end is causing an echo you will be asked to use headphones, or to mute your microphone when not speaking. deliberately making strange or unpleasant noises to annoy other chatters will not be tolerated, and your broadcast will be closed. (this only means that your video/audio feed will be terminated--you will still be allowed to type.)  

i know the rules seem like a lot but there's really only four of them, and only two that pertain to just behaving in a manner that isn't dickish.

Just came up on 60 us another 30 norco 5s

My drug of choice used to be oxycodone 30mg and I finally quit  that as I was done with spending money on it.

Anyway got me 78 dilaudid 8mg for 780 and I prefer dilly IV

However after new years I'm completely done with opiates for at least a year permanently.

And since hydrocodone converts a little into dilaudid I'll use small amounts of norco 5 as needs for withdrawals and taper permanently and get off opiates for good

I can't wait till I no longer need this shit. Time will heal and I say new year because it's 10 times stronger and easier and makes more sense for me to quit on new years than randomly on some day in December.

Anyway wish me luck guys. These dilaudids are gonna be amazing but unfortunately I fuking missed 24mg today.. I missed liked a lot and did 16 mg and by then I didnt feel the rush so now I will wait until tomorrow. ",1512606146.0

What Opiates do you think are the most over/under rated? Methadone has to be the most underrated Opioid. Feels very similar to Oxy or H and lasts twice as long despite It's stigma. 

I'd say that Codeine is probably the most overrated. I can buy Methadone syrup, mix it with Sprite and make Methadone Lean and have twice as good and twice as long lasting of a high for cheaper. Also no Promethazine to ruin the high (which it does for me) I find that the prometh increases sedation while decreasing euphoria. I like to get stuff done when I'm high, not sit around which is what Codeine/prometh does to me. 

I made some 'done lean (red syrup + Sprite) for some friends at a party and they were all blown away. They said it is 100x better than Codeine and cheaper on top of it. They were sold. You also need much less syrup than the Codeine which means a less over sweet drink. IMO I think Methadone is perfect for making Lean. The stuff lasts forever and a better high.

I haven't used since Saturday but withdrawals were no sweat because I haven't been using that much recently. I ended up making about $60 in tips last night at work.  I don't have a solid connect so I have to go through a middleman.

My middle is your typical middle.  He's a fairly shady dude who is never punctual and probably overcharges and I'm most likely getting a little less than what I'm paying for. Through this dude G's for $200.  I figured I'd get $50 worth of shit so .25 of a g.  I hit him up this morning and he says ""yeah no problem. I can meet up with you in about 40 min"".  After about an hour and a half I text him asking if he'll be good soon. No response obviously.  I end up calling him a couple times over an hour and half half, never getting an answer.

Finally, after 2.5 hours from when he originally said 40 min he calls me and gives me some BS story about how his brother took his car and his phone was in his car. He tells me that he has to double check his stash and see if he has a full .25 for me but tells me to start heading over.  I get to the spot and he calls and tells me he's on is way but he only has about $40 worth to get rid of.  Whatever, I'll take it, thinking that since I haven't used since Saturday that hopefully I'll at least feel something, however slight and possibly placebo that may be.  

I grab it and go home practically accepting the fact that I most likely just wasted $40.  I look at it and it's probably about .15/.2 at the most,  again just adding to my feeling of wasting $40.  Well to my surprise the shit is actually pretty good and I'm probably only half way through the shit and feeling nice and warm.  I'm all itchy and I've got that amazing euphoria and feeling content with the world.

I miss Trap Houses and Hookers,".       I really miss running the streets. I miss driving over to the west side to find the best trap house, trying to find who's got the strongest dope going around. Sitting in the UDF parking lot waiting for a prostitute I know to walk out of the nearest alley. Maybe a local dealer I know will show up to buy some BackWoods. However I have to find my dope I will. I have never and will never go home empty handed. 

 .        .Brittany walks from behind the alley to the front of the store where we immediately lock eyes. She knows what I'm there for, not for a $20 blowjob, no, for some heroin. She hops in my car and directs me to the nearest trap house. This was all before I had connections and gained the trust of the dealers to call directly and ask for the trap's location. I had to pay these hookers a fee of $10-$25 for getting me dope and fresh rigs. If they couldn't get rigs I didn't even want the dope, I haven't sniffed or smoked in over a year. These girls never had phones and if they did they would soon be stolen or turned off, so somedays I would drive for hours trying to find a prostitute who's hooked me up in the past or the least sketchy looking girl I could find. I've probably done this 50 plus times either in the beginning or when all my usual guys had bullshit dope. 

 .      .I always gave Brittany $25 because she was my first prostitute to middle for me and she also would almost always get me phenomenal dope and plenty of rigs. She was pretty attractive for a west side hooker, about 6 ft tall with long blonde hair, a thick body, an edge to her, and still had all of her teeth. Although I trusted her to a certain degree, the wait while she was in the trap was excruciating. I would wait down the street in the worst neighborhood in my entire city for sometimes as long as 30 min. There was usually a line at these places so I knew it wouldn't be a quick in and out. The feeling of watching these hoes appear out of the shadows and return to my car with the drugs was  almost better than the drugs themselves. 

.       . I say a quick goodbye to Brittany and tell her I'll call her. To this day I don't think that girl has ever gave me a working number. But there were always other girls on the streets willing to middle for me so I just chalked it up to her loss. I prep about a point of ecp in my plastic spoon and prepare to blast off. Instant register and bliss. Mission accomplished. I drive back to my apartment in complete nervana while chain smoking cigarettes. God, sometimes I just love my city. ",1512580344.0

I've found this long list of drugs that interact with these enzymes and thought it might be a useful resource here (also at bluelight and erowid but i dont feel like making an account, feel free to copy and paste this there if someone wants) so I'm making a but of a PSA for potentiator awareness and information. For those that dont know, potentiators are drugs that interact with other drugs to make the effects better in a variety of ways. Think of your brain as a burning house, opiates as firemen, and potentiators as their axe. Sure, theyll get to that fire and do what theyre trying to do, but if they have an axe itll be really easy and theyll have time to try out that new xbox for the station that was ""lost in the fire."" CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 are enzymes that have to do with how opiates and many other drugs are broken down in the body; inhibitors make them less effective, inducers make them more effective. Ill try to give a quick breakdown of what i know here, but dont take my word for it and do your own research.


https://liferaftgroup.org/long-list-of-inhibitors-and-inducers-of-cyp3a4-and-cyp2d6/


Inducing these enzymes will increase the elimination rate of most relevant drugs and each enzyme has their own set of metabolizations with certain drugs. For example, CYP2D6 metabolizes tramadol into O-desmethyltramadol, a much for potent opiod so youd want to use an inducer with tramadol. CYP3A4 metabolizes morphine into inactive products so you'd want to inhibit it if taking morphine. There are many many things these enzymes can do and it varies drug to drug, so make sure you do your own research. Generally, inhibiting these will make opiates last longer and CYP2D6 is more often considered when potentiating. There is certainly much much more to know about this topic so heres a thread with lots of discussion and explanation.


http://www.bluelight.org/vb/archive/index.php/t-370193.html


As a little aside, I very much enjoy learning about and applying knowledge of drugs. It'd be really cool if people more knowledgeable than me could point me to a specific place, method, or direction that can help me learn more.



Potentiators CAN be dangerous in the sense that if done right, you're essentially taking more of the drug than normal with a given dose, so watch out folks.

If you can't click links for whatever reason the address is https://www.ezcapechat.com/rooms/whereisopiatechat.

We have a lot of fun, so come check it out. Continue below (or not) for disclaimer and rules:

**this chat is not affiliated with this subreddit or its moderators, and has its own moderators, rules, and etiquette. if you feel someone there has slighted you take it up with the moderators of tinychat, as it is completely unaffiliated with and not endorsed by this or any other subreddit.**  

rules:  
1. pick a unique username. this is to protect other users so we know who is who, given the nature of the sort of activities we enjoy.  

2. no lurking. again, to protect the other users. if you come in the room be prepared to introduce yourself and participate for at least a few minutes so we know you're not up to any shenanigans. if you are lurking you will be warned and then given a generous ten minutes to announce yourself. if the time runs out, you will be kicked (not banned) until you are ready to come in and actually participate. if you are a known member whose identity can be confirmed, this rule is not applicable.  

3. no -isms or hate speech, even accidental. one warning will be issued, any continued insistence on such behavior will result in a ban. bans can be contested by pm'ing a moderator (me). this includes but is not limited to racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia. for example, if you are not black, use of the n-word, even with the -a ending, will not be tolerated. i don't care if your friend down the block lets you say it, it's not your lane.  

4. no auditory fuckery. due to peculiarities of the transmission of sound over a chat, certain echos and effects can be amplified to the point of being severely distressing. if it is determined that your end is causing an echo you will be asked to use headphones, or to mute your microphone when not speaking. deliberately making strange or unpleasant noises to annoy other chatters will not be tolerated, and your broadcast will be closed. (this only means that your video/audio feed will be terminated--you will still be allowed to type. this appears to be less of a problem with the new chat app.)

So I started my day at around 1:00 showered made a few phone calls and was out the door by 1:30. Stopped by a shop for some cash, I tho thw asshole low balled me so I went to another shop with a smarter owner/manager, arrived at about 1:45 after stopping to toss the $5 minimum needed in my gas tank, the cars great on gas 26mpg to 45mpg usually closer to mid 30's where I live. After getting 35$ more than original guy I hit up my guy for a meet. 


  I texted first then called 3 minutes later and was hoping to be quick as I was in the area, hence the impatience. He calls me back right as I hang up after hearing his VM. He asks where I'm at I tell him then ask if he's got both and he says yea, yea (awesome only one stop and waiting to meet on one dude before I can retreat home to get my groove on) and well dude told me to meet him 3 different places before deciding McDonalds, great its 3 minutes behind me. Pull up texting him let him know I'm there and light up a smoke and what do you know he shows up right when I get halfway done which when I first started going through him was common, but now it was a nice chance of pace.


  I didn't take any pictures, but he hooked it up for just a little over $100 I got; 16 bags of boy and I'd say close to a gram of soft girl (yes I know its cut but for the price I'm good w/ that). Got home by 2:55 and pushed off shortly after. Been partying pretty good solo for 9 hours. Now I am drinking some rum and coke to chase down my 2mg of klonopin That I crushed and parachuted to try and enhance it a bit. I know alcohol, and klonopin, and dope is generally a recipe for respiratory depression, but I have confidence in my use and the such. Plus I would like to sleep tonight and save my last bit of coke n' dope for a nice morning shot. Being as I have 1 more shot of dope and like 1-2 of coke debating on coke still.



  Well that's my story's pretty much the state of my life, I do this once or twice or thrice a month the other days I set due and get by with suboxone. Any questions or hate or comments or love always appreciated. I do not love this cycle, but I love the time when I'm at today.


   Debating posting my own thread (which I did) as this turned out a lot.longer than I initially had thought and I am on mobile with my laptop legit iny lap so you be the judge on my.common sense intellect. This was mostly stream of.consciousness which I have been told is interesting to listen to because my mind works different than others. Anyway I hope you all have a nice night and a happy holidays.

Have questions!,"Hey guys. So my boyfriend OD'd last night, on dope. The cops and medics and the wholeeeee crew came. They insisted on taking him to the hospital, so we went. A few minutes later, they were there to arrest us. Dick cop told me they were charging me/us with possession. I was confused though, because the dope was all gone. All that was left were empty bags & a rig. So they took me in and left him in the hospital for a few hours, then came and got him too. As I layed there on my cement bed, in my fucking freezing cold cell, I finally asked them wtf was going on. Like what am I even being charged with? He said that Im being held on probable cause for 48 hrs and if the DTs can't put a case together, I'm free to go. So the DTs came in & started asking me where I got the dope from and all that good stuff, so honestly I told them. (dope man isn't my home boy and at this point I'm pissed at him for giving us bad shit and almost killing the love of my life and i do not want to sit in jail. I didn't do anything wrong! I'm traumatized from just watching my bf die and come back right in front of me) Anyway .. the dude I buy from makes me meet him across the state line because well, he isn't fucking stupid. So they said that pretty much isn't helping them bc they need someone who comes into this state (IN). They had the same convo with my bf but i guess they told him that if he doesn't txt them with dmans phone number, ""the deal is off"". But what deal? We were released with no charges. We didn't get a court date. Are the DTs gonna come find him and make him cooperate with them to get the dman? Im confused because don't they use people with charges to help them, and then offer those people immunity from their charges? Can they arrest him for not helping out? And aren't there Good Samaritan Laws that protect us? i just read that there were. Also, the DTs said that there was a rig and some residue left in the bags so thats how they got us for posession. But I dont think we got charged because they released us. Is he obligated to work as an informant? Will they come get him if he doesn't? Is there a law protecting us? Can someone help please. Him and I are both confused and a little freaked out because we have so many unanswered questions. I was hoping that my Reddit friends could help! Please!",1512709748.0

I got into heroin about this time last year. Quickly became less and less interested in other drugs, even other things. Dope and depression became the ONLY things in my life and I'm making a serious effort to improve myself. I've been dependent on various substances from age 15 onward, currently 19 and trying to dig myself out this hole while im still young and have time to make something of myself. I'm finding the hardest part of getting clean isn't staying clean itself, however trying to find other things to fill the shoes left by heroin. I almost never leave the house unless im going straight to my job or home, and am missing the whole lifestyle surrounded by my addiction. It was fast paced, unpredictable. Also certainly dangerous and stupid, but theres nothing quite like it.

I realize none of this is groundbreaking and things like this get posted all the time. I just felt like making a short post that I can go back to in the future and see how I was feeling at this pivotal moment in my future.  Hope someone read it, thanks!

I don’t see anybody talking about it on this sub,"Agmatine really helps. If you’re already shooting up several bags of H a day don’t worry about it. If you can afford it at that level at least, but you can take agmatine. I’ll explain why. 

If you are taking milder Opiates, agmatine will help a lot with potentiation. Your opiate will feel quite a measurable bit stronger if you take agmatine before it. I weigh about 240 and take 2,000 mg agmatine with my opiate medicine, so adjust your agmatine dosage based on that. I could probably take 2,500 of ag, but 2,000 seems to work the best. As well as potentiating the opiate at dose, it also lowers your tolerance slowly. So taking agmatine daily will lower the opiate you need, to feel high or keep you from getting sick at least. This is where you heavy IV users will get some benefit. After a couple weeks you can go from 6 bags a day to 4 or less. It doesn’t affect the feeling of any opiate other than a mild boost to the sedation and euphoria, so it’s only a bonus.

Tl;dr taking agmatine will make your opiate stronger and lower your tolerance over time. ",1512700643.0

I've been using IV dope for 4 years. My girlfriend only got into dope because of me. She had messed with pills previous semi regularly. We've been clean together for 2 months, and we live together.

Since getting clean our lives have gotten exponentially better. New apartment, new jobs, doing well. But she is struggling with depression and has been dead set on picking up this weekend. I thought it would pass as the week went on, but it hasn't. 

I'm not going to lie, I wanna use too. Badly. You know how it is. But I'm kinda happy. I love my job, I'm good at it, and I don't feel so empty anymore all the time. Maybe I can stay clean. But she is intent on going this weekend. Like 110%. 

If she goes and brings it home, I'm going to end up using. I'm very worried that if I ask her to do it on her own away from me she will OD. She has never shot herself up before, and she's always telling me not to ""baby"" her in regards to her dosage when I used to shoot her up. 

How can I approach this? I've said I'm unsure about it. I've told her if her connect isn't around let's just forget it then.. and instead she tells me ""oh fuck no this is happening.""

What do I do? I'm already so anxious and looking forward to using, but I'm not sure I even want to? My stomach is doing backflips in anticipation of something I don't really even wanna do. 


Help!

He asks me “are you out of money?”   I say “yea, I am”.  He replies “wait right here, I’ll be back”.  Ok I think.  Another guy just telling stories.  Well, 5 minutes later he come out of the store, reaches into his pocket and says “how about this? Will this help you?” And hands me 2 $50’s.  I was speechless. 
I hugged him and could only say thank you thank you.

7i8lg9,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7i8lg9/quitting/,21,https://redd.it/7i8lg9,honeybunchesofOPES,Quitting,"I see all of these posts with encouragement for people that are struggling - whichever part of the process they are at and I just wanted to chime in to say:

Thank you. I’m going to have to make myself quit (again) tomorrow because I’m finally at the point where my family’s quality of life might suffer. I previously worked in a position that made me regularly in excess of $250k a year but I was traveling 60% of the year and started using Rx to cope with the depression of missing lots of family events (I missed my sons first birthday & Christmas). 

I quit that job and reinvented myself in a different career and have been able to garner decent money but not enough to support a habit, pay a mortgage, pay for private school, etc. to maintain the facade of normalcy. I have been working in this career field for the last 2.5 years and able to tuck my son into bed every night. I however wasn’t able to reinvent myself in the sense that I still take pills. I am spending money that I shouldn’t to cope with another unhappy and stressful situation at work. 
The content of my current job and the schedule are extremely satisfying. I however have been working with a man that has hit on me (in varying degrees of intensity) over the past year and a half - most could be easily and jokingly (phrases such as “oh haha thank you that’s flattering but I think I would disappoint you) dismissed but this summer I was actually propositioned for sex while my wife was away. I had to actually be very stern that I’m straight and was not interested in having sex. Since June this person has withheld business and effectively reduced my income by $50,000. I’ve been seeking out a new position (both in current industry & prior) since July when I saw the writing on the wall after the sexual harassment. 

I’m at another crossroads now. Yesterday I was offered a position in my previous industry as an employee ( I was a consultant when I raked in the $250k) for $120k + vehicle + several other intangibles since it’s one of the largest MNC in the world. I will certainly have to take a drug test - more than likely urine but I worry about hair since they are able to quantify (somewhat) how much you’ve taken plus I have taken some RX opiates not prescribed to me which would pose an issue. This position has extensive travel (50-60% of the year) but within 1-2 years (it has been explicitly stated) that I would be groomed for an office position. Being away from my family until that happens will be just as difficult as before though because well, I love them. 


Yesterday I was also offered a position at a VERY nice brokerage in an ideal setting that has a tremendous track record. Their lowest producers make $120k and their best make $400k+. I think I could start out very well with my track record over the past two years. I’m somewhat afraid of that position because it is completely commission based. I’ve spent a lot of money I shouldn’t and I will need to float myself until I start to close deals.  There is no drug test for the second position. 

I turned in my notice last Wednesday and my employer asked me to close out all projects and then go, which should be next Wednesday. 

I don’t know what to do but I do know that I need to quit taking pills. I don’t want to go into details but it’s no small amount. I have been to rehab once before and got 3 months clean only to fall back into it. I’ve quit and been through withdrawal probably 100+ times over the last 10 years outside of rehab. 

So many scenarios, possibilities, endings and of course I need to quit to ensure that I am able to pass a urine test and there is no necessity for hair. I acquired 8 - 8 mg Suboxone but it’s so hard to even get to the 24 hour mark unfortunately. I will start these tomorrow I guess. I wonder if anyone here can help me determine initial dosage?

I completely get that all of these problems are first world issues and pale in comparison to what some people go through - but they are real and they are my problems. I am going to have to try and make a good decision for my family and detox at the same time. I’m tired, confused, excited, scared, and a multitude of other emotions to try and steer my ship correctly. 

Sorry for the long whining post but it’s tough to share in meetings for some reason. Thank you for listening. Input welcomed. ",1512671876.0

Would you go back?," So after a few days break i went and copped today. I get to the block and right away see a dude that i copped from before but he says he doesn't know me so i park me truck in the parking lot at the end of the block where they always are. Three is two younger dboys one starts grilling me he finally says ok but immediately walks away. I'm used to this hassle, i don't look like your typical junkie, I drive a clean older truck and already come alone. I don't take it personal if i was them I'd wonder about me to, but i have been coming here for a month. I bail out, which you more than often have to do.  I walk back to the first guy i talk to, two more come out he asks if they know me they both say no.  After a little hesitation 1 walks up, easy and smooth transaction. I walk back and say to other one, common man you don't recognize me? You served me a few times. He says hell no, i don't recognize no one. I just say ok and get back in my truck. As soon as i do three squads come flying in. The first one stops in front of the house they are always coming out of. The second goes to go around him, it looked like he was gonna pull into the lot where i was parked. If he wanted me there was nothing i could do about it, i had no where to go. So i popped my bags in my mouth and watched but he through his car in park and got out. It looked like they all got away and i was able to slide out the back of the parking lot being only two blocks from the eway and being in the clear. It's on a vey busy street that is under construction so it took a long time to make it those two blocks. The dboy who said he doesn't recognize anyone was walking in the same direction and staring at me the whole way. 

So getting to my question do you think it would be a bad move to go back? Im not talking about because it's hot, but because they might think i set this up. This spot has a ton of traffic, is been hot this isn't the first or the last time the cops have hit it.  AGAIN I'm not asking if you think i should risk getting stopped by the cops there, but if you would risk getting out for a hand to hand. They were asking if i was a cop not a snitch so i think the worst that would happen is no one would serve me. But idk we all know its part of the game. I think it will be good to try again in a couple days. What do you think? ",1512671273.0

I got lucky and got a free ride into a decent rehab, it had its downs like it was cold and there wasn't a lot of recreation, although it was advertised that they had a ton of recreation, a spa, massages, a gym. Really theres just a lady who came to do hair if you made an appointment on like the 3rd sat of the month which is also family visit time so you have to take time from you visit to get a haircut, a lady who comes once a week to do massages and acupunvture both you only get free the first time (wait, no free massage just acupuncture in the ear only) and if you want it again after that (nvm the $40,000 you pay out of pocket) you have to pay and schcedule it.

Here comes a wall o text.

Dear Ceya,

You have no idea how much I've missed you and thought about you. I didn't leave a note while visiting you in the hospital while they had you in that medically induced coma because I thought you wouldn't want anyone to see you like that. All of us were terrified. Girl, do you know how many of our atheist or god hating friends (like myself) actually prayed? When Ellie told me through sniffles and about a million tissues about your foot turning inward in the bed it broke me down bad because I knew the last thing you bought was those super sexy bright pink platform heels with the buckles that now you wouldn't even be able to wear for at least a while. That was just profoundly sad. My tears spelled out your name more than a few times.

I'm kind of glad your family is keeping the healthier you away from us. It's lonely, to be sure, but it's better this way. Many of your friends and I are afraid of inflicting ourselves on you and your recovery. Those nonbelievers are still praying, not because the believe in God but because they believe in asking for good things to come to you. 

Ellie told me you thought you ruined my life by being a bad example when I was knee high to a doc marten. Hell no, I've been destroying myself long before you sold to me, nor were you the first I bought from or used with. I don't put that on the first folks either because that was all me. Going through you was vastly safer than other scary folks. Not to mention I surely would have turned cyan and died without Big Sister's supervision. You were better to me than I deserved.  The people who loved you were helped by your hand so many times whether it was cleans, fronts, supervision, or a couch to sleep on. We crave good news of our truest friend.

Ceya, I miss you and whether you're clean or not, you're absolutely the best. If you are I hope it's permanent and hope to join you one day. If not, I understand. I just wanted to let you know I can never love you less.",1512832834.0

But what about all the good Dboys and middles out there? I felt like making this appreciation thread after copping with my middles today. Also I gotta give some credit to my first ever dboy.So about 2 years ago now (Maybe just a bit over 1 year? W/E doesn't matter) I met my first Dboy. He live about 5 minutes away from me, had a business degree, and was all around good at managing money. Very, very professional, and he was white too. He charged a fair price and his stuff wasn't half bad. What made him particularly awesome though was we could totally just chill and shoot the shit. Our conversations weren't just limited to 2 words, and we shared a lot of interests in music and video games. and the best part about this dude? I never had to wait! He was always ready as soon as I came on by. We were about as close to friends as one can be with their D-boy. Given the nature of ""The game"" as yáll like to call it we could never actually be friends exactly. But we got along well, and he treated me good. He'd hook me up fat too fairly regularly.

So rafter he got arrested on completely unrelated bullshit charges I found my current middle. He's also a pretty cool dude too! I got a long ass drive to get to him, which is annoying but the nice thing is that it helps me not go and cop junk all the time so I don't get addicted. He also doesn't short me. Whenever we meet up with the dboy he's right next to me and he always takes his half, which is a totally reasonable amount. Also he's got a good sense of humor so we also joke around a bit and shoot the shit.


So yeah, the 2 people that I had to go through to get H have been pretty good too me and I don't have any complaints. And honestly I can say is kinda enjoy/ed the time I've spent dealing with them.

I know everyone who's been addicted would say you haven't even seen the tip of the iceberg of the shitshow heroin or opiates bring, but I literally have no feelings or emotions at all, it's a depression so deep I don't even feel human since my brain has turned off any viable/emotion-  signaling systems. I've tried every other remedy, anti depressants, weed, weekly therapy, stimulants, and they just don't work. I remain flat and nihilistic and keep questioning the purpose of anything. I have friends family education a job, and I have been walking around like a zombie for years. The stress of life and the meaningless of everything have left me completely paralyzed, and only opiates have given me any sort of relief or hope - again, the very few times I have had any. If I ever spiraled into an active addiction I know it would destroy the friends/job situation but i think I'd be fine with it, cuz I see no reason in staying alive anyways, probably the only thing keeping me around is knowing that maybe I'll find some opiates to enjoy.

Ive been alternating between this and my other mainline for almost my entire use, and it was exactly where my vein was supposed to be, so I pushed down a lil just to check, and fuck did it hurt. Definitely an artery. Just switched to my other arm and moved on with no problems. Anyway, I decided to do another shot just now back in my left arm to see if my vein was back in place, (I'm using a 1/2 inch needle, I always hit my vein right when the needle is fully inserted at a 30 something degree angle), but suddenly, as the needle was about half in, it hurt like /hell/. It burned badly. I kept going for whatever reason, and right before the needle was fully inserted, it stopped. I registered, and you guessed it, bright red blood. I removed the needle and bled like a stuck pig of course, but now I'm curious: tf happened to my vein? I've never had an artery so shallow before, and I'm positive it was not there before. I had never hit an artery in the crook of either elbow in my 2 year history of IV use. Anyone got an idea?

*My name is Jesse*

*I have a history of polysubstance abuse - mainly EtOH.  I have destroyed the last decade of my life.*

*Today I have 100 days sober*

*I have been using kratom daily for precisely 98 days*


**Kratom has helped me with three issues**

*1) completely abolishes alcohol cravings/ mental obsession*

*2) abolished constant suicidal ideation*

*3) reduces feelings of dissociation*

*4) overeating /binging / purging (BED & bulimia)*


**I consider kratom safe for these reasons**

*1) no urge to compulsively redose*

*2) don't feel ""loaded"" or ""intoxicated""*

*3) greatly reduced nicotine use*

*4) tolerance does not develop with moderate use*

**This is why I'm actively looking for an alternative**

*1) limited duration of action (</=6 hr) - therefore a second dosage is required towards the end of the day*

*2) 15-20$/day cost /not financially sustainable*

*~
I am afforded the ability to utilize health insurance as of the first of 2018* - *in lieu of this, on the hunt for a more viable and long-term option* *(I have used buprenorphine in the past with positive results surpassing kratom)*

**The main issues and /or hindrances to this**

     *I currently live in halfway therefore, typical opioids are obviously tested for*



*¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬*
**What I am looking for today are suggestions and ideas from the /r/opiates community**

~
**Here are my remaining tangential thoughts**


*°Research Chemicals are not out of the realm of possibility - yes, I have tried tianeptine (and abused it instantly... IV and oral... 100g in 35days)*

*°Is there anything that triggers the release of endogenous opioids?  (obviously other than EtOH) *

*°ALSO anything that DOESN'T recruit b arrestin*


~
*Thanks for your time and suggestions
Also, P. S. if this is better suited in a different subreddit OR in multiple ones please let me know*

*Warm regards, 
Jesse*

2. no lurking. again, to protect the other users. if you come in the room be prepared to introduce yourself and participate for at least a few minutes so we know you're not up to any shenanigans. if you are lurking you will be warned and then given a generous ten minutes to announce yourself. if the time runs out, you will be kicked (not banned) until you are ready to come in and actually participate. if you are a known member whose identity can be confirmed, this rule is not applicable.  

3. no -isms or hate speech, even accidental. one warning will be issued, any continued insistence on such behavior will result in a ban. bans can be contested by pm'ing a moderator (me). this includes but is not limited to racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia. for example, if you are not black, use of the n-word, even with the -a ending, will not be tolerated. i don't care if your friend down the block lets you say it, it's not your lane.  

4. no auditory fuckery. due to peculiarities of the transmission of sound over a chat, certain echos and effects can be amplified to the point of being severely distressing. if it is determined that your end is causing an echo you will be asked to use headphones, or to mute your microphone when not speaking. deliberately making strange or unpleasant noises to annoy other chatters will not be tolerated, and your broadcast will be closed. (this only means that your video/audio feed will be terminated--you will still be allowed to type. this appears to be less of a problem with the new chat app.)  


i know the rules seem like a lot but there's really only four of them, and only two that pertain to just behaving in a manner that isn't dickish. thanks, and hope to see you there! **don't use alone.**",1512793701.0

Thats all we can do,"Ive been an opiate(heroin) user for 6+ years, Ive never IVd anything. Never been to jail, never been hospitalized, never lost a job. I wish I could say I never lost a relationship but no matter how close to the chest I play it, rumours abound and people avoid me. It hurts most when former friends constantly keep you at arm's length so to speak, call into question your motives constantly, and just generally make no secret of their lack of trust.

It gets tough going through withdrawals, and the way I use I do it to myself constantly. I tend to use on again, off again, usually 2-3 months at a time (max) and then 2-3+ off, but sometimes I flop back and forth weeks at a time because I cant get a clean streak going. Its tough not having the same support system, even before I was using, just to talk and joke with friends for hours and hours. Its rough not being able to share with many people what im going through. Im lucky to have someone in my life whos there for me but even that only goes so far. 

I need a change man, somethings gotta give. I feel like ive been stuck on a plateau for the passed 2 years just continually stepping forward but making no progress. Ive progressed while using junk, some of my greatest achievements post HS graduation were junked up and mid habit. Idk if its the environment, or the circumstance Im at in my life. I dont know if its even something I can control but im not sitting by and watching myself deteriorate.

Im being proactive. Im taking the right steps. Im an engineer of my personality and can manifest my reality. Ive been lacking in putting that into practice, but thats one of the few universal truths of this life. We are capable of so much, and we use so little of our potential. Lets be real with ourselves -- what are we operating at 25% capacity? 10%? Probably closer to <5%, and im in that category too. Just putting a number on the minutes wasted in a day, even a bullshit ballpark estimate is a sobering statistic. Im putting my money where my mouth is and stepping that number up. Nobody is perfect, nobody is even half perfect. If i can get my ass to 25% capacity I bet results will be unprecedented. And im still going to be chipping,  you better believe it.

He texts back to meet me at some location in the city, the location kinda sucked because I also had to buy some new syringes and the spot he picked wasn't that close to a pharmacy. 

I buy the dope then walk back to the busstop to wait for the bus so I can pick up some rigs. There are close to a dozen pharmacies in my city, I never go to the same one twice in a row.. I rotate pharmacies as often as I rotate injection sites... to keep judgment down.

The one I decided to go to was kinda a new one, it opened a few months ago and I bought syringes there once before. I patiently wait my turn and when  my number appears on the next in queue sign I walk to the counter. I order the usual 29G 12,7mm 1ML syringe and get my wallet out to pay... and then the employee/owner/manager/whatever said no and that they don't sell them over the counter. I explained to her that I've been here before and that a different employee sold rigs to me before, her reply was that she would have a talk with her collegue because it's not their policy to sell syringes with needles.

I left a bit pissed off because of this bullshit, I wanted to shoot up and it started to snow. Didn't have enough time left to go to a different pharmacy except for the one next to the hospital which is open 24/7 but it's at the other side of the city. So I just went home & searched the garbage bag til I found the needle that I threw away this morning and used that one.

Now I'm looking online to see if I can find any laws regarding the sale of medical supplies cause this is kinda bullshit. I've read through several pages of law text and haven't found anything yet.

So, I tried H and though the nod wasn't as strong at first, it never gave me sinus troubles!

**Past examples include:**

* ""30% off normal price when we buy $200 bux in subs, bring the money tonight and I'll get it in the AM.""

* ""I dropped three bags outside, can you give me a couple.""

* ""Loan me three bags and I'll pay you back with interest -- five bags."" After which extra days go by due to circumstances beyond his control(lies, actually).

* Me: I can't spend that much, I need the last $40 for subs. 
  Cliff: I'll cover the subs at the end of the week, I'll make sure I hold on to $40 for that purpose.
  Cliff at the end of the week: We'll see the sub connect tomorrow after 3 when the kids get off school. (tomorrow is saturday, there is no school!)

###The Meat of this post


In the past when I ordered two buns for me, and two buns for him I'd make a point of spending another $40 to $80 on subs. Each time, inevitably the dboy ""wouldn't be able to get subs"" and the money for subs would go towards getting an additonal bun. So from there we would each have 2.5 buns instead of 2 buns each. 


&nbsp;

Let's just make believe that half a bun is equal to one extra day of getting high on H or at least staying well and not being sick. 


**Is it really worth one extra day worth of dope to run the risk of being dope-sick for a week?** This as opposed to buying subs that would guarantee that neither of us would get sick for over a week.

Someone I knows wife is very stressed and tense all the time. Her elderly mother lives with her and has two children on the autism spectrum. She also has severe back pain that she deals with. I’m looking for some suggestions. The husband and wife both love opiates but they seem to not do as much anymore. I’m guessing tolerance is a bitch. She can take 10 10/325mg pills of Vikes and be normal to slightly relaxed. She loves Benzos and is her go to since she has a good prescription and supply . I’m sure she’d love fentanyl but we have no clue how to use it. Second choice would be a one night H party. I was thinking she’d might like X, Molly or MMDA. Does that melt away the stress? The husband has had great times on X but always in a group setting Is it good to be hanging around the house and kids on it. Can you be in control? Anyway this is a one time thing and would appreciate any advice as my source will be gone. 

To further clarify why I suggested H is she LOVES the opiate high and can’t get it anymore. Would one time really be a horrible idea? I posted this on r/drugs and didn’t get the response I wanted. ",1512762047.0

In just short of 3 months, I have taken so many substances that I feel like Ive fucked myself up for life or at least potentially for months or years. I haven't used Heroin in over 3 weeks. That has been the ultimate goal but I feel absolutely horrible still because of not only how bad I was before quitting, but the other bullshit ive been taking since quitting. I haven't taken Gabapentin in 4 days and I can honestly say using GABA for 2 weeks in high doses fucked me up more than the years of heroin abuse. I'm currently experiencing the most intense and depressing withdrawal I've ever had to go through. Maybe it's also the Xanax I took for 5 straight days last week on top of the clonodine and 2,400 mg of gabapentin a day as well. I also have been smoking an ungodly amount of weed and drank a few too many rum and Cokes after my dad's funeral on Monday.

.        . From mid August to mid November  I was using 1-2 grams of IV heroin( probably cut with fentanyl) and Suboxone in between doses for a couple weeks. I was also smoking crack, popping Xanax and Klonopin on occasion and not sleeping at all. I maybe managed 2 or 3 hours of sleep a night during those few months because I was so fucking high all the time I would constantly fight the urge to sleep just so I could stay up and enjoy my high. It was probably the most unhealthy period of my entire 5 year heroin addiction. 

.      . About three weeks ago I got fired from my job and my life was falling apart. I decided to get clean again but this time around I made many many mistakes in the process that have just caused my suffering to continue until today. I used about 32 mg of Suboxone the first 5 days, then switched to 20-30 grams of Kratom and 10-20 mg of loperamide for another week, and then I made the biggest mistake of all. I went to my doctor and was prescribed Gabapentin, clonodine, and sleeping pills. I also took Xanax for 5 days and have been smoking tons of weed like I mentioned before. 

.       . It's been 4 days since I've taken any gabapentin and about a week and a half since I've had any opiates and I feel like complete shit. I'm still taking about .3 clonodine a day and hydroxyzine at as well as smoking weed. I will have to come off by next week too. I'm assuming I'm going to have rebound hypertension and anxiety from the clonodine and depression, anxiety, and insomnia from the weed. So I'm not even close to feeling better and getting my life back. Fuck me I hate life right now.

So I've been getting into  Podcasts lately, they're good in the background and I know some of you do too (well, one or two certainly). I listen to a few BBC World Service ones, mainly to keep my English up and some of the interviews are great (Hardtalk is brilliant if you've every heard of it). One of the programmes is called 'The Enquiry', each episode looks to answer a question and they do that by getting feedback from 4 'expert witnesses' as they call them. I think it's good listening anyways. 

The latest episode that dropped yesterday happens to be about the Opiod Crisis so I thought a couple of people here might want to give it a listen. They talk about what's happening in America a little, but the actual focus is how America has affected treatment through opiods in other parts of the world, especially poorer parts. If you had to sum the question up I guess it would read more like: 'Why is access to Opiods so unequal'. 

I thought it talked about a side not covered in the media (that I've heard), and might give fellow users something to think about. Here's the [Link](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w3csvsyd#play) (It works for me and I'm not in the UK). It's only about 25 minutes long, also accessible through your podcast app and just an interesting listen. Hope you all check it out.

My first time into rehab was my last time. My first time getting clean has been a real success story. Not even 1 slip, pain pill wise. I'm now 2 months clean from fucking around with benzos. I'm on methadone, but I considered it clean because I don't even fill the 'done. 



I wanted to come by and tell y'all, it can happen. I also wanted to tell you guys how I did it; I keep looking up stats on lapses for opiates. I want to beat the stats, I don't want to be a stat. I think it's 90 plus per cent of opiate addicts relapse in the first MONTH and just about 100 per cent relapse in the first year. I forgot all of em but I just keep beating the stats and it's making me feel real fucking good and it's helping. So if you're like me, cos this won't help everyone, hell I might be the only one it helps, y'all know how addiction works and shit. Look up stats and get that into your mind that you don't want to be just another statistic. You have to have the mindset of wanting to get clean. 



I smoke a hella amount of weed now, started about 2 months ago because I was about to relapse. So if you're feeling like you're about to relapse, buy weed. Don't buy painers (or h). And going the methadone or sub direction isn't bad. It's actually one of the best ways to go right next to rehab. Don't be afraid to open up to a loved one that you need help and start methadone or bupe. Having family on my side has helped me so fucking much. They make me feel incredible how they're so proud of me being clean and staying that way and going to the clinic every day. It snowed bad as fuck and yet I still went. I don't want to let them down either but more importantly I don't want to let **myself** down ya kno? 



If you guys want any advice on getting clean; detox, rehab, and methadone/bupe, don't be afraid to post. That's the real reason why I thought I'd come here. To say Hi cos it has been a mad minute and I missed y'all and to answer any questions to maybe help one person get clean.

If we hear about someone offering a insanely good deal for $500 of dope and have to obtain the money within 3 hours, we will somehow make that $500 in less than 3 hours! Yet, you can give us 1 month  to come up with the minimum payment of $35 for a credit card payment and we are more than likely going to miss the due date and aquire a late fee that costs just as much as the minimum payment and eventually wind up in collections overtime. However, the whole time we will still be spending at least a $100/day on dope. If only we were able to put the energy and dedication we spend on getting dope into our regular finances and quality of life... It's seriously a trip! Absolutely mind-boggling....


Anyone have any tips as to how to reverse that way of thinking that so many of us are programmed into doing? Or AT LEAST just be a functioning addict that can have that motivation and dedication into or regular finances AND dope? ",1512897093.0

Nah, at work there was a conversation about how junkies and tweakers tote signs and beg, basically do nothing, and can actually make a shit load of money. They didn't really drive the drugs part, the main focus was the concept of much money for little effort.

Wasn't it a couple years ago that the cards against humanity guys basically said, ""Quick! Donate 5 dollars right now and you'll get jack shit in return! Literally nothing!"" $71,145. Not kidding. That's the American people for ya. Anyway not trying to get off track, but I was wondering if there has ever been something as ridiculous as a kickstarter or fundraiser thing some junkie made out of desperation? Like us fiends have definitely done some unthinkable and outisde the box shit to get high, but I want some to see some articles/stories of specific incidents. I feel like most would just lie about cancer or something, but if the cards against humanity guys can advertise a money for nothing exchange and somehow make $71,145 from it, some junkie should be able to advertise money for my heroin and make something too.",1512894258.0

I've been on around 4 mg a day for the last year and a half or so. Well the other day I woke up and was bored so i decided for kicks and giggles to shoot 2 mg of sub. Which up intill that point I only did like one or two other times mad long ago when I first got on maintenance.

I got pretty damn high off it. Like I wasn't full blown heroin high but it was damn close as far as euphoria. It lasted a good 40 minute to an hour and continued to feel decent for awhile after that. Well that was like 5-6 days ago at this point and I can't stop shooting them. I haven't experienced anything similar since to the first time but idk it still makes me feel just a little better than normal. Almost normal to what subs feel like but with a little more pep in my step and mood elevation. 

I know a lot of this is probably placebo at this point. But I just enjoy doing it now even without the good euphoric rush I got the first time. I gotta stop before this becomes a real issue and do it for too long. Does anyone know potential risks I'm taking shooting the strips?

You died last week all alone. To be honest the way you used it was bound to happen sooner or later I just wish someone was there to help you. 

We met in rehab. We had both been in multiple rehabs and should have known better that rehab romances don't work out. I guess we were just too attracted to each other.  

I left on a Saturday. On Monday you called me and said you were leaving early and come pick you up. I should have known when I was picking you up at a Burger King and not the rehab something was up. Well you already had a box of 100 rigs and more than a enough dope but we still pawned your iPad and shit that day to get more. You stayed with me for a few days but I couldn't have you there forever so you went back to rehab. I would come to the meetings you were at and bring you dope. One time I got you bars and you ate all 10 in less than a day and got kicked out. What was I thinking letting you come back to stay with me. 

As the months flew by we were spending several thousands a month shooting more and more dope the benefits of you being a rich girl. You also got a prescription again and we were off to the races. 90 Opana 10 IR and 90 Opana 30 er a month. Shoot through that in a week or two then back to dope. 

Eventually shit got out of hand. You saved my life when I was OD on the bathroom floor and not two days later I had to do the same for you. I knew it was a matter of time before we weren't so lucky and didn't have narcan around. I suggested we go to Mexico and do ibogaine as I had already done it about two years prior. You didn't want to stop. I made the decision to go and told you you had to be out when I got back. 

I got back from Mexico and you came through and brought me some dope. I ODed and you saved me again. I had to get away from this so went to rehab in a different part of the state. Away from you. I had to get away to live. While I was there you contacted my mom once to say our mutual friend had died from an overdose and I didn't call you back. I wish I did because now my two best friends I shot dope with everyday while I stayed in Florida are now gone. 

When I got back you were on your way to California going to rehab. Last month the day I got home from yet another detox actually you happened to call me out of the blue saying how well you were doing at rehab and were really going to be try to be sober this time and so should I. 

Well last Sunday you picked up for the last time. I don't know what made you do it but I understand how hard this is to break the cycle. 

It was Tuesday and I was just starting an IV molly binge that lasted a few days when I got the news. I finally fell asleep and when I woke up it all hit me. When you died Sunday night I was still shooting speedballs all alone since Saturday morning. It easily could have been me and not you. The way the universe works I guess. 

Why did you pick up again and why didn't you have someone around. You'll always be in my heart.  RIP LS ",1512874408.0

I took the bus to cop, on the ride home I dropped my wallet somehow and didn't notice till I got home. I obviously freaked out cause I had the dope tucked away in a back pocket of my wallet. I had to wait 1.5 hours till the bus came back to the station and luckily when I asked the bus driver if he found a wallet, he had! I was pumped until I opened it and couldn't find the bag of dope. Along with the bag of dope, I was also missing a check from my mom for my birthday (that I had already deposited through banking app) and a $50 giftcard to Applebees. While I appreciate that whoever took it left my debit and credit cards, I was more concerned with the dope. I'm sure whoever took it is high and enjoying some Applebees right now, at least I had more money to go cop again.",1512858688.0

OBS : I take venlafaxine and 300mg of seroquel
I did a lot of dangerous combos like 700ml of pure vodka , with 300ml of pure whisky , swallowed 30mg ambien ( sometimes snorted ) with 2mg klonopin and my 300mg seroquel and i was always fine , but in a dangerous place.
Btw i always had such a huge fear of opiates like codeine or oxy's , and they are less dangerous than a lot of normal combos!
already did 120mg codeine 25mg prometh + 2mg kpins and i was better than the last combo I wrote.
Like , Opiates by them selfs , with no mixing drugs , are really fine. Obviously with caution , and weeks without to keep your body and tolerance okay.
What im trying to say is that i always had a fear that doenst need to be , now im only on Opiates and nothing more ( except my 300mg seroquel ) and I know that i will wake up again..now im more in love with my opiates! FUCK ALCOHOL , FUCK BENZOS , FUCK AMBIEN. AND..FUCK CIGARETTES!",1512857799.0

Basically, I LOVE opiates but I haven't been able to get any of the good stuff since DNMs went down. Not asking for sources here at all, but I'm wondering how you all located your first pusherman? I am a student in the UK and opiates are a completely nonexistent (it seems) at street level. Calls to my dealers selling the standard boring shit like ket and weed asking 'have you got any... ummm heroin' are met with anger or 'you shouldnt be doing that man'.

I am just interested to find out how the process starts - more from the point of view of someone who sought it out, rather than slipped into it through friends or doctors prescribing pin meds.

P.S. there is no use telling me 'just dont get into it man', I love it and despite being sober for so long it is on my mind 24/7. I can also control myself pretty well (so far) in terms of limiting my usage.

Thanks!

Also: I understand sourcing is banned, but I'm just looking for anecdotal stuff. Not like proper sources or areas I could go to to find it etc. I dont think that' against the rules, correct me if I'm wrong.",1512849840.0
