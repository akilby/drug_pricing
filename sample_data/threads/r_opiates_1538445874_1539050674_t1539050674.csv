But i find it absurd that 90% of rehabs are affiliated with 12 step programs and that they say AA is the only way to get sober. First off, i dont want to be ""sober"", i want to live my life without having the obsession of using opiates and benzos. I still plan on using marijuana. 

People in 12 step programs instantly declare you ""not ready"" and say you will relapse. AA is so outdated i cant believe this shit is the most talked about way to stop using drugs. Every single meeting is exactally the same. People sharing the same thing saying you must work the program and get a sponsor blah blah blah. They say straight lies saying if you honestly complete the 12 steps you will stay sober. I know plently of people who took it seriously that have relapsed. Back when i gave AA a try, my sponsor relapsed.

Im currently in a rehab and the whole program is hand outs from 12 step groups and going to meetings at night. I tell everyone i just dont agree with what they say and instantly everyone thinks im going to relapse and think i dont care about getting better or im just ""not ready."" I have been to 12 step rehabs 6 times and it didnt do me any good. Its like giving someone the same medicine 6 times after it keeps not working. 

I have also heard someone say ""I feel empathy for all of you who do not have a sponsor, because YOU WILL DIE! 

They also say it doesnt have to do with god but just look at the 12 steps, it says god like 7 times. And you even say the our father at the end of some meetings. I think ""turning you life over to a higher power"" is bullshit and that we as addicts need to actually make progressive changes about ourselfs and not ""give it to god."" 

And the whole chip thing. Thats not right to make someone who has lets say a year clean, and they relapse to fucking start over and make them feel like a failure. They still got a fucking year clean and can get back to where they were. Making someone annouce how many days they have, i think hurts more than helps. 

Im about to go to a meeting now and im dreading listening to these fucking idiots praise god and talk about how shitty there life is and how much fun it was when they were using. Its like all they remeber is the ""good ol times."" I could go on and on about how much i hate 12 step programs but what do you guys think? I want to know how others feel and if im the only one who sees through the AA nonsense.",1539049158.0

She said this is the first time but, she’s lied to me so many times I can’t believe her. 

I want to be supportive but, every time I give her a chance she messes up right away. She says I’m too controlling with the money but, I’m the only one working and want the bills paid. I thought by letting her be in control of the money she would see that I trust her again. 

She gave me her last two pills and I flushed em. I think I overreacted. I don’t know if those are the last two. I don’t know what to do. I was so proud of what we were accomplishing together, now I feel so alone. She’s the only one that I go to when I’m sad. She’s the only one that makes me happy.

This shit is fucking insane..so her sugar daddy is a very old man who has dimenshia and is clinically ill.  He can't keep his finances straight and forgets what is going on with his close family.  On top of that his daughters and even their lawyer has contacted this lady about keeping her hands off his money and stop abusing his old man any further.  But she will not listen and honestly feels she is entitled to his money.  She even told me she hasn't physically seen him in over 2 months.  It's really painful to hear how excited this scummbag is to financially ruin this decent old man.  I read a letter from his family begging her to stop stealing his money, to the point where his grand daughters had to stop going to college because he couldn't afford to support their tuition.  She was bragging that his family switched his credit card numbers but she went through his wallet and wrote down the new numbers.

I just can't believe this toothless lady can sit here smoking $200 worth of crack, and $200 worth of heroin.  In a hotel she charges on his credit card, eats food he pays for.  Then spends all day ordering clothes and other items online with his credit cards.  It would make anyone with half a heart sick to their stomach.  What would you do?

I respond that I can handle cold turkey and rehab isn't an option in the sense that I would be missing work and I don't need anyone else finding out about me relapsing especially considering the negative effect felt from just him finding out. My wife is getting induced on Saturday and I'll have 3 days off work to spend at the hospital and I can use that time to wisely cold turkey it out there. I'm just so upset at the fact that he just wants to ditch on me and expect me to tell my mom and wife and expect them not to freak out on me as well. It's just disappointing that you feel you have a supportive friend and they turn out to just dip out on you and basically he didn't even want to finish the car ride with me. He wanted me to turn around and take him back home and that hurts.... In case you non users ever wonder why we lie... This is why... Because when we tell the truth we get shit on.

Around 2011 my hip was popped out but i thought it was just back pain. I bought roxis and dope off the street and never really figured out what was wrong until i got 100 % sober. august 10th i start a methadone clinic for a year exactly, then august 10th of 2017 i went to rehab for methadone coke and benzoes. Rehab was under insurance the clinic was not. I have moved out of state and started seeing a different doctor. He gave me kpins for 3 months then cut me off because he saod i was addicted. Once i started school, i was walking because it was pretty much across the street. I could feel something was wrong but wasnt sure. Well my leg has been hurting for awhile so i went to the dr and they said nothing in the hip is broken, but it does pop out of place.

My question is, since im going to this dr under insurance will he be able to see the psych ward visits for detox and rehab visits even though they were in a different state? Also will he be able to see the methadone clinic even though it wasnt under insurance? I would like to get pain pills, but if hell only give me suboxone, id rather go to my gp because hell allow me to smoke weed and i had to sign a paper for the bone dr saying i wont use illicit drugs. Also the bone dr who im now going to had me sign a paper saying i wont lie if i was addicted and if i do, they have the right to not treat me. 

So im asking this before i spend all my money to see him and if he asks and i lie, then get kicked out and be right back at square one. Just trying to figure out what i should do about this. ",1539027251.0

I had to wait a bit after I got the script for subs to start anyway because it's for a ten day supply to start and the receptionist made a 14 day appointment while insisting that she had counted exactly ten days even after I pointed her mistake out.

Last week I quit cold Turkey and had 3 days clean because I had no money but when Thursday came around, my paycheck cleared and i got high immediately.

I'm in a financial situation where I need to save as much money as I possibly can but working without getting high has proven to be one of my biggest obstacles. I have about half a subutex now and my buddy gets a script for them so on Thursday when I get paid instead of blowing all my money on dope I want to strategize how o can get clean without dealing with the withdrawal.

This morning was about 12 hours since my last fix and I was sweating, had a runny nose, and the shits was looming around the corner. I was gonna try to tough it out at work but I'm a baby when it comes to working sick so I got high.

On Thursday my order of 250g of kratom comes in and I get my paycheck so I want to get one or two more subs and some 1mg kpins from my buddy and ride this shit out so I can get clean and save my money. I only have like $70 to my name until then.

Nobody knows I've relapsed and I need to keep it that way. I can tell the withdrawal isn't nearly as bad as it was but I want to be smart about it this time. 

I'm in the dark right now so reddit is my only support system when it comes to trying to get sober at the moment.

9melmq,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9melmq/codeine_overdose/,14,https://redd.it/9melmq,keiayamada,Codeine Overdose,"Yes you read it right.


Well so yeah it happened.. First of all, let it be known that I live in a far east Asian country, Japan, where drugs are the biggest social taboo and regulated very strictly, hell nobody here knows the difference between meth and marijuana, most people here even refer marijuana as to a type of ""meth-like stimulant"". A gram of marijuana has a street value of over $60, which is still rare as fuck, and you could never dream of finding a heroin dealer unless you live in the center of Tokyo, and you can get arrested and be expected do ten years in jail for possessing like 0.01g of cannabis. For these reasons, codeine and dihydrocodeine are pretty much the only readily available drug here that can be obtained easily. Those two substances are OTC in Japan. I can just walk into a nearby drugstore (not even a legitimate pharmacy) and grab a bottle of DHC pills that costs less than 10 dollars. The only bad thing I'm getting is a suspicious look from the staffs but eh do I really care. Second of all, I'm 18 years of age, 160cm (5'3"") tall and weigh 55kg (120lbs), completely naive to opaites so you know I'm lightweight. 

It hasn't been so long since I started abusing dihydrocodeine pills (mixed with ephedrine). My DOC only have been OTC shit like DXM and alcohol and failed attempts to try natural psychedelics. One $10 bottle of dihydrocodeine pills contain 84 sugar-coated pills and each pill contains 2.5mg of DHC. When I first started, I started with a very low amount, around 50mg. It felt like heaven and I felt like a feather and I have been doing this every day for an entire month. My tolerance and dosage only went up every single day. It happened last night, I swallowed 50 pills of DHC which equates into 125mg of DHC, my stomach was full so it took a couple hours to kick in. When the codeine kicked in, I decided that I wanted to redose since my tolerance is building up and I wanted to feel like the first time once again. So as the codeine starts kicking in, I swallowed all the remaining pills in the bottle. 34 pills. So I was getting high on 210mg of DHC in total. My high started peaking and it felt amazing. It felt like my first time on codeine and I wondered how there can be stronger substances like heroin and fentanyl when even the weakest of opiates can deliver me excessive euphoria. It felt good... until after three hours. It's been around 8 hours since I dosed, and I was peaking for three hours that's where I started noticing there's something wrong. The peak would usually only last less than an hour and codeine should wear off typically four hours after kicking in. It wasn't. So I decided to turn off my phone and try to sleep. I closed my eyes and I was still feeling euphoric and extremely sedated. I was very tired at that time so I didn't have any doubt I would fall asleep instantly. Well that didn't happen. My high ended up peaking for six hours, SIX FUCKING HOURS and I couldn't fall asleep at all despite having my eyes closed for four hours , it was a very uncomfortable experience. I got up to get ready for school, was feeling like shit but still tried to go regardless. I got on the train and I was feeling extremely nauseous but I assumed that I wasn't feeling well because of the lack of sleep. Well I ended up vomitting... I puked in my mouth and had to swallow it back I know how disgusting it sounds but I had no other solutions. Got off at the next stop and asked the station staffs for help. I eventually got to school but I was bedridden at the nurse's office and got sent home. 

I would have never expected to overdose on a weak substance like Dihydrocodeine. I still can't believe my high was peaking for six hours straight. It really is far beyond my ability to comprehend, that there are many people out there shooting heroin non-stop to feel good, when a simple overdose on codeine makes me feel like I'm dying. How do people even manage stronger substances? Well I'm sure I'm never touching codeine again at least this week. I needed some tolerance break, after all.

I am indeed aware of all the negative stigma around the substance codeine on this sub, but it's still my drug of choice. I don't care if you call me a featherweight cunt or whatever, go take your opiate elitism somewhere else if that's what you're intending to do. ",1539003338.0

(for sure not an artery),"i dont come across many who have experienced this but i know i and at least a couple others i know experience pain IVing into certain veins, almost exclusively small veins, often on the hand. im pretty certain im not missing because i have registered and reregistered to make sure im in and no big bubble forms under the skin although these increase the chances of small bubbles since the veins are so small half the time i miss a little bit somewhere in the process.

&#x200B;

any ideas on whats going on with this? my guesses are either i am missing a little maybe the needle doesnt fit in the vein perfectly so a little squirts out the side or something, but ive had pain where there was almost no signs of vein and skin irritation afterwards suggesting i missed none of it. plus it seems the force of injecting would force the vein off if it were already poorly inserted. 

&#x200B;

perhaps these veins run alongside/intertwine with nerves and the movement of liquid through them puts pressure on the nerves or something?

&#x200B;

ps i know its definitely not an artery, ive hit those. when i hear people say they willingly inject into arteries i think they either never actually hit an artery or they are lying to look hardcore, that shit sucks i would never willingly do that. painful veins arent even close, i dont mind using them as long as im not actually fucking osme shit up.",1539000491.0

Tonight I OD’d at a dinner party in front of my GF, her biz partner and her parents. I feel like such an idiot and terribly ashamed that her family had to witness that.

I’ve been casually using over the last few months.  I got my hands on 10 M30s and I’ve been taking them a quarter at a time since August.  I take such a small dose because I’m small (5”5 / 120 lbs) and because I don’t want to develop a habit or a tolerance.

Well tonight, I learned my lesson that there is no such thing as a casual user.  I’d searched this sub to gauge what other people’s experience was snorting instead of swallowing m30 pills.  They all seemed positive so I decided to try it.  I crushed and snorted 5 mgs to see what would happen.

I remember feeling really high really quickly.  Way too high.  When I swallow the pills, I don’t feel anything for almost an hour but this onset happened within 5 minutes.  I was able to hold it together for 15 minutes before I passed out on the couch.

2 hours later, my GF tried to wake me up but I wasn’t responding.  Her biz partner told her to call 911 immediately and he had to administer CPR because my breathing and heart rate slowed so much.  I now have a bruise on my chest from where he was doing the compressions.

Then suddenly, I was awake with EMTs and the fire dept. loading me onto a gurney and taking me to the hospital.  I started crying because I was scared and I was ashamed.  No one knows that I’ve been taking these roxys.  I hid it so well because I would space them out weeks apart and take such a dose as to feel amazing but not nod off.

The cat’s out of the bag now.  My GF had to call my parents and explain to them what happened.  I’m going to dinner with her parents tomorrow and i have to explain to them how their daughter’s gf almost died in front of them.  It’s 5am and I can’t sleep because my chest is in a lot of pain and I’m terrified of taking a Xanax to fall back asleep. 

I learned today that there is no such thing as a casual user of opioids.  I should be dead right now.  Had I taken this on my own, there would’ve been no one to save me in time.  I gave the remaining 7 pills to my GF and told her to get rid of them.  I’m done for good.  

TL:DR - I thought I was being slick by being a secret casual user and almost died trying to snort 5mgs of roxicodone.  ",1538912826.0

I used to be mostly a psychedelic guy with a side of RC stim use at occasional parties. 4-HO-MET was my first drug ever besides alcohol, and I fell in love at the first trip, over two years ago at this point. After that, I would trip every three or four months on 4-HO-MET—such a beautiful, colorful world. I still do. My thoughts run a mile a minute, but it’s a really fun and occasionally insightful change of pace. I was also lucky enough to try real synthetic mescaline once—it’s an incredibly gentle yet powerful guiding psychedelic. Still have a couple grams stashed.
		
I got a gram of O-DSMT out of curiosity alongside my usual psychedelic purchases, and enjoyed it enough to dose about once per week. Ran out, went three months without it until I found a way to get it again, and bought a gram and a half. Still working my way through that stash; I’ve been chipping O-DSMT for about a year now since the original purchase.

I won’t lie—I love this stuff, and look forward to my dose when a day off from work rolls around (I don’t have a “fixed” work week due to the nature of my job). I get a good five hours of warm, cozy bliss every five to ten days, snuggling up in bed, listening to music, and watching some streams. To resist the temptation to escalate my dose amount/frequency, I log every dose, try to keep busy with work and hobbies to ward off thoughts of dosing out of boredom, and try to use only as a reward and not a coping mechanism. I take longer, two to three week breaks from my use now and then. 

But even though I try to do everything right...on a bad day, I’m always aware of that nagging feeling in the back of my head, that a nice dose of O-DSMT would dispel those emotions. It worries me. I’m well aware that it only takes one crippling setback in life to “break” a chipper...but fuck me, I have an opportunity to buy five more grams. Can’t bring myself to buy it, can’t bring myself to turn the offer down either. I know it’s weak stuff compared to H and the stronger pharma opiates, but damn.

TLDR: Naive dude thinks he can use opioids in moderation, kinda succeeds for a year but is caught off guard by just how powerful they are.",1538960263.0

Long post, questions marked as *question* below if you'd just like to skip the wall of text and background info. Thank you!","I apologise about the wall of text I just wanted to be as specific and thorough as I could be so theres minimal confusion by vagueness.

So one of my best friends and I have found a Methadone Maintenance Clinic kinda close to us that take cash and is affordable, $17 per day for your Methadone Dosage and counselling which is totally affordable (in comparison to a daily dope habit) and almost unheard of from quite literally any other clinic in my area. The fee never changes unless you switch to Bupe or Subs, we've got a mutual friend who's been attending for what I would consider a long time, more than 8 years and is completely reliant on the MDone now, just like any dope habit however clearly cheaper and safer. And he is also up too 180mg(mL)? per day.
So, I've been researching MDone Maintenance as thoroughly as possible and I've still got some questions I hope anyone here can  help me understand a little better..

*(1)I want this to be temporary, and as temporary as possible not long term, is this possible Thoughts? I know this isn't ideal but the last thing I want is to be hook on another drug and from what I've read methadone WDs are some of the worst because of how long acting this drug specifically is.*

I would ideally like to start on the highest dose I need to at least have minimal discomfort, maybe even none but I don't wanna push it. Then I'd like to continually drop my dose everyday there after for two weeks at most, less is possible?

*How feasible is this or is this just not possible?*

The clinic and its employees are really cool and pretty down to earth people, includin the main Dr like honestly some of the coolest people I've ever personally dealt with in years. I was told, by main doctor, I can go one day(today) and never come back or we can come back for life as long as we're alive. They're willing to work with you on dosages but I'm just not thinking to the degree I'm wanting or hoping for like consistently dropping dosages especially so early on?

*(2) How long(as in once a day doses) can I expect to use this without just getting another habit on a different drug? The induction was 30mg(ml)? Of liquid MDone thats all they'll do, as long as your comfortable which Im ok my biggest thing is I'm at least not dying like normal H withdrawal, however they will up your dose on day two if need or you can stay at your current dose but they didn't say anything about lowering my dosage? I'd like to ask them if I can slowly lower the dosage day after day even if I have to lie and say that it's too much and I could do with less even though I know I could use more I just wanna use this to get this monkey off my back and been done with everything with a slow but steady daily reduction until it's as low as they'll allow me to go then just jump off if possible.*
*Is this a viable option to any of you, what are you thoughts?*

I apologise for the book, I've researched as thoroughly as I could and these were the last of my concerns that I couldn't find readily available online or I found conflicting answers which is bound to happen I'd just like opinions from real users and not some article . I apologise for any errors and the length, I'm on mobile and I'm honestly super excited to get this over with and move on with my life fibally. This my first real attempt at quitting and staying clean and I know relapse happens but I really am going to give it my all to move forward with sobriety, from all drugs actually, and start to improve my life and leave this shit in the past. I know it won't be easy, it's really fucking hard or I wouldn't be here asking these questions at another clinic trying another drug to get off this shit once and for all, for the fourth time in 2 years honestly. Suboxone just wasn't for me, straight bupe tablets by it's self may have worked but the sub clinics in my area won't let you use straight bupe longer than the induction and first week or so. Then suboxone is mandatory, obviously to deter potential drug abuse, which is totally understandable but that drug combo in particular just didn't sit well with me mentally or physically. The negative side effects both mentally and physically just made me uncomfortable in my own skin and in my own mind honesty. So bupe then subs are the first and generally the only drugs they offer around here that's why the MDone clinic is so huge for me, for whatever reason the vast majority of clinics won't even talk about methadone, it's like buprenorphine/nalaxone are the only viable options to them when if what I read was correct, methadone also has opiate/opioid blocking effects just not to the extent of bupe/subs?

Anyway tanks so much all. Any responses or opinions really are very much appreciated. I will listen to absolutely anything anyone has to input on my questions and first hand experience would be fantastic but not necessary as I know it took me personally two years to even find a methadone maintenance program anywhere near me that was also flexible and affordable.

I relapsed today after 6 months of suboxone maintenance. I've been feeling very down during my favorite month of the year. Halloween the leaves changing pumpkins and all things that used to make me the happiest didn't help. Finally after like 5 or 6 years found a girl that I real feelings for that i think is mutual. Since I've moved to the Midwest I work constantly and have very few friends to spend time with when i have free time. It's funny though when I was back home on Long Island I had a band, many groups of friends, and an awesome caring family. But all I wanted was to be left alone. I got what i wanted and now I want nothing more then to have companionship. Funny how those things happen.

Anyways because of that after meeting this gorgeous young girl, she brought back many amazing feelings I forgot that I even had. Yet those good feeling came along with the other terrible feeling I used to have. Like paranoia, jealousy and wearing my heart on my sleeve so my heart can just shatter at
Any moment. If this happens i know it's irrational and i may be a gigantic pussy but I'm done with it all I'm never putting myself out there again. Since i have not friends and family here I've grown very attached to this girl. I finally got the weekend off which I never get and we were suppose to have a really nice night to eat popcorn and watch scary movies something that really would've meant so much to me since I haven't gotten to
Do that with someone in a really long time. Which turned into I'm tired maybe I'll Just come over and talk to Im not comming over at all. She couldn't even just talk on the phone for like a little
Bit. I know it sounds small and stupid but it really would've meant so much to me. 

So all that combined with just being alone with my thoughts and a wallet of
Cash triggered something in my mind to make the hour drive to my plug that never told me his name bought a gram and threw away 6 months that i worked really hard to get.

Well now I have to tell my counselor at the clinic I relapsed and face the consequences of my failure. I almost stopped myself too. Sorry for the long shitty post but I needed to vent and you guys are the only people who get it. Thank you

I picked up both boxes and got home. Opened one box ready to take my dose. They come in those [typical blister packs](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Cold_Form_Foil_blister_pack2.jpg/220px-Cold_Form_Foil_blister_pack2.jpg). I went to pop the first pill out...and it was just empty, absolutely nothing inside. I tried 3 more pill slots and they too were empty. I shook the strip against my ear to listen for a rattling sound, but didn't hear it. I checked the other box and that was fine and normal. I was baffled and perplexed. I left the last few slots unopened in case I had to prove it.

So I called up Boots to speak to the pharmacist that oversees my script. I explained to him the problem and he asked me to come in. When I got there, and he told me he had checked the rest of their stock of Buprenorphine, and half of the strips had the same problem. He said there must of been a massive manufacturing error and he would have to alert Boots HQ and the manufacturer immediately. He had a look at the half-opened strip I brought in, apologized and gave me the 7 pills that were missing.

In a way, I'm thankful half their stock had the same problem or he might not of believed me.

I get all the common symptoms like the shakes, cold sweating, runny nose, diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, and especially insomnia. But one thing I always suffered from that I've never heard/read anybody ever experience is something I call the tingles. It's an extremely unpleasant tingling sensation that centralizes in my lower neck. It used to be closer to my back in days past, but for the past few years it's always my neck. Along the spine regardless. Imagine that feeling of nails on a chalkboard times ten. That's what it feels like. Like all the nerves in that area are screaming for help. The only way to make it go away is to move your body. Its usually only present if you're holding still. Makes if impossible to hold still, which also means it makes it impossible to sleep. It's not painful. It just makes you feel like you wanna run away and rip your skin off. Has anybody else experienced this or something similar? Recently I've been taking high doses of tianeptine sodium and getting hooked on that for a few days, then I'll take a break. Addiction comes fast which means withdrawal is pretty much guaranteed after just a couple days of usage. The withdrawal is pretty much the same as opiates, but the tingles and insomnia are the absolute worst. There's no rest until it's over. Or if you have kratom. Kratom makes it all go away like magic.

It was a normal day, except this time I fancied some Heroin. I don't consider myself an addict at all. I call up my plug, who's always hooked me with very strong pure dope. I've had a lot of it tested too. He called and said ""Hey, got some #4 Chong and some Tar, I've got some hard Fent going too.""

I asked for 3 bags. I usually buy a lot of stuff and then ration it out fiercely. I ordered a .5 of his Tar and 1.5g of his Chinese White, also ordered 3 Fent pills with it.

I met the guy and he brought me my stuff. I paid him £90 per G so £180 for 2, and then £15 each per pill because they're rare as fuck around where I live.

Day one, I shoot up a .1 of the White, and Jesus Christ. It was the strongest, dankest, warmest, best dope I've ever had in my life. I smoked some Tar later in the evening and I enjoyed that a lot. The next day, I wanted to not take more of my H, so instead I crushed and snorted one of my fent pills. It blew my fucking head off. I can't quite explain how fucking STRONG it was. It's, just beyond anything. After the fent had worn off, I just felt shook because of how strong it was. I shot up a .1 of tar after this to calm me down.

First time I chose to fuck with Fentanyl, and I'm gonna admit I'll probably do it again. It was goood but scary as fuck because it really blew my head off.

Yesterday night I dreamed I had a bit of coke left in my stash and started planning on buying some more to shoot a nice, phat speedball... I didn't get to shoot the speedball in my dream tho. 




After being on a more or less continuous speedball binge since last November, I'm now on my second whole week off coke. That was the first dream of that nature. I'm still using dope daily, but that doesn't incapacitate me nearly as much as speedballs.




When I took my morning shot of plain dope a couple of days ago, it felt unbelievably good. Just that sweet, warm way cinnamon and honey taste, but in my brain. The way it felt in the beginning. How am I ever supposed to cut this out of my life?



That hunger for a high made my tolerance grow out of control. In addition to the maintenance of 1000mg morphine daily I shoot between 0.6g and 2g of dope. 

I need to taper down soon. Neither an increase of my already high maintenance dose nor kicking my dope habit from one day to another are options that will do. If I want to stay functional I need to scrap all my self discipline together and taper down until it's sensible to ask my doc to raise my dose by 100 or 200mg.




  Idk what the maximum prescribable dosage of morphine is, but I fear that a doc assisted taper starting now will involve switching to methadone. And methadone turns me into a useless, nodding zombie.
 



My financial situation is another reason to get a grip. My paycheck is only growing from here on out, but that also means that my credit limit grows with it. I'm already about 3.5kEuro in debt. This isn't the world, but I'd really like to spend some of the money I earn on other things than the basics and drugs. Like new clothes or maybe a new laptop.  




Still, I just spend another 50 bucks on dope and feel a bit helpless about starting the taper. Has anyone experience with tapering down iv dope? I wouldn't mind some advice on how to do this right. Currently I shoot twice in the morning and after work 2 to 5 times. If I miss maintenance, I'll take my gear to work and shoot there 1 to 3 times over an 8hr work day.




Hope everyone is doing splendid! 




TLDR: I dreamt of speedballs after being 2 weeks off em. Still shooting between 0.6 and 2g of dope on top 1000mg morphine maintenance and looking for advice on how to taper the dope habit down to a point where a small raise of the maintenance dose can kill the wd's. ",1538914512.0

First off, I’d like to say that I hope whomever is reading this ends up having a great rest of their day! And takes the time to actually read this personal story I wish to share about myself and my struggles with heroin addiction. I hope I can save someone from slipping down the same tracks that I took. Serious post though, no trolls please. Anyways lol, so yea... as you can guess from the title, I’m a heroin addict. I am 24 years old and have been an opiate user since age 16, with daily use from age 18/19 onwards. I popped oxys mainly from age 16 to 17, and eventually got introduced to dilaudids and morphine, before eventually moving onto smoking/snorting heroin around age 18. I basically “chased the dragon” everyday and was introduced to my first IV usage when I was 19. I will never forget that day... Easily categorized amongst one of the best and worst days of my life until that point. The reason I described it as one of the best, as well as one of the worst days, was because I had never gotten so high in my young life from anything I’d ever done up until that point. It was so intense and amazing that it will forever be a memorable day, but was also the beginning of an unexpected turn to hell mainly due to the fact that my severe addiction to heroin basically stemmed from that incident... I had never injected any drug ever in my life up until the day I first tried IV heroin. From age 19 to 22, I’d spend the majority of my time scoring and banging H, with temporary mini stints in county jails, rehab centers, and halfway houses. I was put on probation for a year for possession of marijuana (3 OZ) and heroin (1.3 grams), but that obviously didn’t stop me from using. It wasn’t until halfway through the age of 22 that I would enroll into a suboxone maintenance therapy program. Suboxone was a wonder drug for me. I struggled  staying fully off heroin for a bit at first but eventually managed to almost make it to 5 months of not using heroin, or any opiate for that matter. That is the longest I’ve ever managed to stay off opiates since I began using opiates at the age of 16,.. and I was taking 8mg suboxone strips once a day everyday for those 4-5ish months. Without suboxone or methadone, the longest I’d ever managed to stay clean off opiates (not including my 60 day jail sentence) was literally 7 days, not even maybe... and that was still with the help of smoking massive amounts of kush and wax, with a Xanax bar every 4-6 hours. My life then consisted of short sobriety periods followed by a few days of relapsing with IV heroin, and repeat. That cycle went on and on, with my life actually showing signs of improvement, regardless of my reoccurring baby relapses... Then one day, my amazing lovely girlfriend of 14 months got tired of putting up with my shit (she only smoked pot and drank occasionally, nothing else) and left me... I’ve been in 4 ‘serious’ relationships in my whole life, and I truly thought this one might’ve been the one. Devastated, I picked up using daily again... And to this very moment of me sharing my story with you all, I have been banging heroin daily, and spending whatever extra money left on xanax, weed, and of course life necessities. Ive worked as a server part-time at many local and chain restaurants for most of my adult life, since dropping out of college at age 19. To fully support myself, as well as my fucking habit, ive had to resort to illegal activities on the side to fully meet my needs as a drug addict. Here I am now; turning 24 in a couple weeks, currently unemployed at this time, using heroin, xanax, drinking alcohol, smoking herb, and occasionally partaking in IV cocaine or IV meth, if it is offered. These last 3 weeks, I’ve actually been enjoying speedballs just about everyday. I am single as shit... My family wants basically nothing to do with me... I am running out of friends I can count on... I’m broke all the time... I mean I’ve honestly probably given all of my heroin dealers atleast $100,000 if I have to honestly make a guess... and that’s just heroin. Surprisingly, if you saw me in person though, you wouldn’t even suspect me of being a hardcore depressed junkie, or so I’ve been told by many. My arms are my only dead give away honestly, but its chilly where I live so sweatshirts ftw. Heroin ruined my life, and I know I might get blasted for only being 24, with a whole life ahead of me, but yo... I honestly feel like I fucked myself worse than the old timers who started late in life. I mean, I have a whole life ahead of me, and I’m literally going to have to live everyday of my life from now on craving heroin, regardless of how much it’s fucked my life up... this shit is fucked and i wish there was a way to somehow spread my personal struggle with this drug, because I believe anybody honestly considering trying out the junkie lifestyle should re-evaluate what they are deciding and realize that this shit really does end up with you being dead, in prison, or severely mentally ill to the point of no return. And you’re going to go through a lot of bullshit along the way until your fate eventually catches up to you. I just shot up 5 hours ago, but I am trying my best to get sober again, or at least gradually decrease my use over time. No suboxone, no methadone; I don’t want MAT (medical assisted treatment) this time. I want to get clean off everything without the help of another narcotic. But it’s hard. Thanks for reading my story, I hope whoever took the time to read all of this actually appreciated me sharing my struggle and would recommend it to anyone taking on the path of opiates for recreational use... because recreational opiate use does not exist... it may seem to exist for so long, but believe me. It eventually gets too expensive, or your supply goes dry leaving you sick, or whatever. Eventually heroin will cross paths with you, and as a pill popper struggling to maintain a good cheap high, you will consider giving it a try. And it will seem like the better alternative at first, due to it being pretty potent now days and readily available. Nobody intentionally wakes up out of nowhere and decides they want to ruin their life with heroin, it just happens... quicker than you may even notice. And when it’s too late, usually it’s too late. Heroin will literally grab you by the balls. Male or female, black or white, rich or poor, gay or straight, none of that matters. Heroin ruins all lives. I can’t even count how many friends of mine died from an overdose. I’ve even overdosed, multiple times actually, between 5 and 7 times. I am lucky to be here and typing this honestly. After even a single overdose, you risk death or irreversible damage... too much lack of oxygen can put you into a permanent vegetative state where you can’t do shit literally on your own. I say all of this true, negative shit about this drug, and am still using it because I can’t stop. That’s how addictive this shit is. Stay strong everybody. ",1538904163.0

What load of shit that is. I had spinal surgery on September 10th at 40ish days clean and then it was OK to accept the script from the doc so long as I took it as prescribed. I did that. I took it just as prescribed. Then, when I finally got into pain management I was honest with the doctor.

&#x200B;

My opioid abuse has primarily been my prescribed medication. There was a time for 7 days in 2017 where I attempted to IV Oxymorphone that was scripted to me, I went through 120 dilaudid tablets in 10 days and I told the doctor that as recently as July 24th-July 29th, 2018 that I did a major fuck it because of pain and snorted heroin for 4 days. My pain doctor won't prescribe, he's prepared me for W/Ds with clonidine and a steroid pack for inflammation. I'm just freaked the fuck out.

&#x200B;

I'm sitting here typing and shaking at a serious 9+ painscore. I called my neurosurgeon early this evening and he said that's normal for a patient 3 weeks out of the type of surgery I had. So I had some validation there. I just made a script that was supposed to be out on October 2nd be out about 18hrs ago. I mean it's not a high dosage but the pain, combined with rebound pain from the opiates, combined with withdrawal symptoms is something that becomes a real problem.

&#x200B;

So I just want to smoke marijuana and get to bed but if I do that I'll be taking a newcomers chip and fuck that. I might not return to the rooms at that point. I don't know, this kind of hurt is so inhumane.",1538900850.0

But for everyone else I'm a normie with sleep and headache issues...

I take ""legal pharma pills"" in front of friends and family, toss a codeine or two (it's OTC here in the UK) to those who need for period pains and headache, I can't stand the sight of anyone suffering, but don't thank me - thank the opiates flowing through my system - easing me into a smile, and making me stop suffering in its tracks with a *one time only* dose of comfort **[seriously the worst thing you can do is let someone else get addicted and drag with you... luckily everyone I try to surround myself with and family takes them very rarely and respects them as they have medical background/knowledge to know about tolerance and want to preserve the effect for when REALLY needed].** 

It's unbecoming to self proclaim JJ, but I try my bestest to give out some 5mg IR oxycodone capsules to those really in need and who take only once a month for occasional pain. I warn everyone **sternly**, and I don't know enough people/friends to help them, because I don't want to be treated differently just because I have a disease, I don't hurt anyone and I function, and only wish I could view myself highly enough that hurting myself (emotionally) is enough of a crime.

I keep getting the urge to leave an oxy with a homeless person, give them the warmth they need on a cold rainy day.... 

I don't know if I think their heroin tolerance is too high to feel oxy 5 mg or it's just I want to keep the money for myself/others, or is it that I don't want them to get addicted?? I can't even decide, but all are factors. Life is complicated, but it's easy to live by the law of common human decency, and the poppy helps me do that, and stops the pain and anger getting between my heart and the heart of another, stranger or friend.

But if I have a job and my emotions slowly fade, no one takes notice and my boss says do whatever you gotta do, mixing instant coffee with powdered milk as she walks out of her office to the meeting, clumps of undissolved brown and white agglutinations foat at the surface, barely visible.

I don't get trackmarks, and my bank account stays at a steady £58 from work, and I passed my exams, which lead to that big promotion.. and i have a doctor's note for sick days... but I could do so much more. I do honestly appreciate how AMAZING I have it and cringe at the fact that I want to boast because I'm high but please God tech me humility, don't let me get too close to the sun on wings of candle wax.

Okay I hope at least one person can relate, I've seen it posted on here about functional addicts that have jobs and families, some lose it all, a tenth of 1% maybe quit while they're ahead or manage to keep 2-3 years of a job before getting on subs.

PSA: SUBS HONESTLY CURE DEPRESSION

Okay it's a drug called [Buprenorphine/samidorphan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buprenorphine/samidorphan) and it bascially reduces the hgh on the mu receptor (that has morphine like effects vs the oxy-like effects from kappa and delta opioid receptors), via the samidorphan which is like milder naltrexone that takes 80% of the high, leaving thre antidepressant effect! 

It's ""An adjunct to antidepressant therapy in treatment-resistant depression (TRD). [2]"" So alongside it helps especially for those that had an opiate shaped hole in their heart/brain receptors needing to be chemically balanced in a way that doesn't get you high enough to abuse it and tos the balance back away from your favour. It's all about moderation and dosage. 

###[The Dose Makes the Poison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_dose_makes_the_poison)

[A 2016 study with 139 participants available free online to look at](https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ajp.2015.15070921) concludes ""The buprenorphine/samidorphan combination is a novel and promising candidate for treatment of major depressive disorder in patients who have an inadequate response to standard antidepressants.""

It's been known that subs help more than just withdrawal compared to methadone (which actually helps withdrawal but no antidepressant). I'd love to hear from people more experienced with subs as I've only used them 3x sessions and just over days and weeks. So someone who maybe had clinical depression symptoms and got incidentally cured when they quit their opioid of choice for subs detox/maintenance, and how it affected them positive/negative, and any other meds.

I'll post that PSA in a separate thread if anyone thinks it's helping them.

Here’s why I think Suboxone might get rid of opiates out of your system. When you take Suboxone the buprenorphine (and maybe the nalaxone) binds to your opiate receptors and knocks off any opiates that might still be in your system. Well my theory is that when this happens it speeds up the process of getting opiates out of your system.

Never made my mom worried and she never had an issue with my use.(I’m 19) She just doesn’t want me to use drugs that are illegal and I respect that.(I need clean pee for my career anyways) My grandma started using Kratom recently after years of chronic pain and failed surgery’s and she said she was getting depressed because of her pain and said that it works better than Percocet or tramadol which she can barely get because of the opioid crisis. If it becomes illegal in Ohio I’m sure other states will follow suit and and eventually it’ll be federally legal. But it’ll create a massive underground need for it and it’ll potentially be laced and way too over priced. It’s an amazing substance that makes my quality of life 10 times better and I’m sad to see that it might go away. I absolutely hate the corrupt government in the United States and I’m thinking about moving to Canada as soon as I can.

I remember when Heroin first started to gain a little popularity around here (Everyone preferred pharm 30s or Opanas), there was this dark gray stuff that was absolute fire.

Anyone else get hella upset when people attack the heroin dealers? Was watching some vice piece on how a dad who lost his daughter to heroin said he'd kill every heroin dealer, and some reporter put a camera in the face of some dealer being arrested yelling ""how does it feel knowing you're ruining families?"". 

These dealers did not come to my house in the middle of the night and force feed me heroin. WE hit up dealers to get our fix, and by blaming the dealers we're ignoring the plethora of societal, mental, and financial issues that contribute to drug addiction. The only possible way a dealer can be blamed is if he is providing product that is not legitimate: I know the risks associated with ordering Burger King, I would not blame them for my health, and I know the risks associated with heroin, so I do not go to the dealer and say ""well fuck! Why would you let me make a conscious decision as an adult!"".

Question about withdrawal/dosage/length of habit.,"After some bad experience with back pain, I ended up with a heroin habit I never meant to cop (though I suppose no one ever does.)

Its been about 2 years, and I've never used more than a gram a day. My average for the last 6 months is a half gram, 3/4ths of a gram *max*, and in the last month or so, I've been stretching my dosages out so that many of them are at least 12 hours apart. I know for a fact that as little as .10ish can keep me solid for about 12 hours and .20 holds me for *at least* anywhere from 10 to even 20 hours sometimes, which makes me wonder just how bad my withdrawals would be if I stopped cold turkey. Tapering seems to be a little difficult for me, as I tend to sometimes use just to relax every now and again, and it interferes with my dedication to tapering, not to mention, sometimes I need to use to get me through a work shift or a daily outing or routine. It would be much easier, I think, to just put my mind to quitting, so long as the wd isn't going to be too terrible.


Anyone have any experience in this area? Low dosage usage, I never get ""gacked"" to where I'm falling out all over the place. Only ever take enough to just kind of relax and calm my anxiety. Individual dosages are between .10 and .20, and they can keep me good for half a day at least. Usually do 3 or 4 shots a day, anywhere between .10 and .20, never more than 3/4ths of a gram a day (usually more like 1/2).

Almost wondering if maybe wds might be mild enough to cold kick.

I hope I'm not violating rules by posting this here. I stupidly tried legal advice first. Ha. I suppose that shows exactly how naive and idiotic I can be. I'm a drug/alcohol counselor. Its my second career and one that will be ending very soon. I chose to enter this field years after I graduated with a B.S. in bio/chemistry and a nursing license. I'm in a part of the country with a terrible rate of overdoses. Just to be clear up front, I do not consider drugs to be evil and I have my doubts about how much 'good' our laws do. I believe our entire legal system just makes the situation worse and the current crusade against opiates is ruining lives. it isn't likely I would have been able to stay at my current job for long anyway but an incident occurred that clinched it for me. It was very unrealistic of me to ever believe that the facility I work for exists to help people. It does not. It exists to make money. They own multiple 'apartment complexes' that are supposedly for people in recovery. They cost 4 times as much as a normal apartment in this area and they bully people into taking leases there using the legal system. Thats pretty much their M.O. for everything. Use the legal system to bully people. 

&#x200B;

I have one client who is very likely going to be maxing out a sentence in state prison after she goes in front of the judge. She is the county jail right now. I am very upset because I believe the drug test that got her the violation was manipulated. I've been working with her for over a year and she has not had a dirty test for me in 13 months. She would have been finished with probation Monday if she hadn't been violated. She has had violations in the past and has been dealing with probation, jail, recovery cycles for years all dating from the same original charges. She just couldn't break out of it until she started methadone therapy, but she was doing very well on the methadone. I'm just going to quickly explain the situation. Maybe I am mistaken but I don't think so.

&#x200B;

She takes methadone and our closest clinic does not allow take-home for more than a weekend for people on probation. She had to go to the clinic and get her daily dose except saturday and sunday. She came to our facility on a Wednesday. I wasn't there because I was working as a nurse in inpatient due to staffing issues. Another counselor 'helped' her and gave her a random urine test. No big deal. She was clean, or so she thought. I didn't think it would be an issue either. I come to find out 2 days later on our normally scheduled appointment that the other counselor expedited the lab results of the test she gave and didn't use an instant strip. The lab results showed heroin and xanax. They did not show any methadone. None. The drug test I gave on her normal day to meet with me, 2 days later, showed just methadone in the instant test. When I received the lab results, 9 days later and my client was already sitting in jail, it was the same. There was nothing but her prescribed methadone. The results were very similar to the test I had given her the previous Friday. The time between the test friday and the test from the other counselor on a wednesday was 5 days, then another 2 days  after the 'positive' to the next test I gave her on the friday of that week.

&#x200B;

I'm aware people can fake drug tests but thats not easy to do on maintenance therapy. She would have to make sure the fake/stored urine had methadone in it. We do observed drug tests at our facility. So does the methadone clinic. So does probation. Thats a lot of places and a lot of drug tests to manage fake urine through observed tests. I don't think it could be done. No one is that good or that lucky, not to mention that sometimes the methadone clinic just does oral swabs. We have them too and I used one of them the day I obtained the last urine sample from her as well because I had already been told she had a dirty urine and I didn't believe it. The oral test also showed just methadone. 

&#x200B;

My question for anyone who cares to answer, is this: Is it possible for someone on methadone maintenance therapy to have a negative drug test (for methadone) in between two tests showing a positive for methadone in the span of 7 days? I don't think it is. I know methadone has a very long half-life and I just do not see any way that could be possible. She even had her dose of methadone the morning of the drug tests that supposedly contained xanax and heroin, but not methadone. Xanax can get iffy but I don't think a drug test Friday could have been negative for it when she had a fairly high amount show up Wednesday. The facility I work for forces people to sign consents for their counselors and supervisors to release information to probation/parole and even the police. The addition of the police to those forms is new. I find it all upsetting and completely worthless. I do not think people can actually benefit from therapy of any sort when counselors can't be trusted. I don't use the consents I have. They sit in a drawer and I do not call and turn people in. Most of my colleagues do, then they use probation/parole to get clients into longer treatment programs, force them to live in the insanely expensive apt complexes 'managed' by the facility, or force people into the long-term inpatient rehab located in a different part of the state. The counselor who called and informed my client's PO of the dirty urine didn't even have the authority to do that. One of my supervisors could have, but not another counselor. We're not allowed to access and disclose information on each other's clients. 

&#x200B;

 I think its all just a money-making scheme at this point but now someone who should have been a success story is looking at time in state prison and I don't know how to help her. I just dont think the drug test results could possibly have turned out like that. Am I wrong? Do I just have too much hope for my clients and I'm letting it cloud my judgment? That is what I'm being told at work and the people at the legal advice sub told me I was a complete fool and my client was lying. I searched that sub and found other posts from people along similar lines. All of them were told that it was ridiculous, addicts lie, don't be stupid, except one. The one they all piled on board with in shared outrage was posted by a lawyer whose wife was caught up in drug testing at a hospital maternity ward. Of course they believed him. He's a lawyer, of course his wife's drug test was a false positive. The husband noted a threat from a counselor in his post and just flat out stated that the counselor told him the test could turn out positive whether his wife used or not so he should really think about that. They believed him. I believe him too, but I find it very upsetting that he gets the benefit of the doubt simply for being a lawyer while everyone else is either lying or an idiot. ",1538850331.0

Constantly relapse or supplement and use on top of it. 

Recently went to detox and got out and within a few days had an overdose. 

Suboxone causes me major drug rashes/allergy that leaves red mark's all over my chest that seriously hurt and causes major nausea. That and for some reason I can use on top of the subs and get high off this fentanyl shit that's everywhere.    

As for methadone I generally puke everyday after taking my dose and if I do manage to hold it down I'm nauseous the whole day and have major dysphoria, totally lethargic and apathetic and my sleep cycles are just murdered. 

So I decided to change my maintenance clinic as the other methadone clinic I go to is not meeting my needs at all. Saw a new doctor at a new clinic and this clinic seems much more progressive and open to new alternatives for treatment. I saw an extremely thorough and intelligent Asian doctor who seemed incredibly interested in his job and what he was doing. This guy was more knowledgeable then any addiction doctor I have ever seen. Literally was asking me the consistency and colour of the fent/heroin I was using and could list off what was in each batch based on his patients and what type they were using since he asks them all and categorizes it. 

So after listening and realizing I don't do well on either of these drugs he switched my 90mg methadone dose to 360mg of kadian slow release morphine and also gave me clonidine and trazodone if the switch is rough at all. Will be going up 40mg a day until iam stable and settled. This was also because I have a history of chronic pain and he deemed this alot more suitable. The other good thing about this clinic is they actually have end game for tapering down unlike alot of methadone clinics. 

All I have to say is I have a new appreciation for canadian addiction doctors and clinics that are open to all means of maintenance and not just suboxone or methadone. One size does not always fit all.

Got myself into a little predicament and figured the good people on R/opiates would be the place for help.

I have been on and off opiates heavily my entire adult life ( going on 14 years). Once I started I hit the ground running and did not look back. I've pretty much always been either strung out on pills or in Suboxone/subutex maintenance. 

Around a year ago moved away from my hometown to a new city, away from all my accumulated plugs. Here the only thing available ive been able to find is shitty H or unbelievably good pressed Roxy's. Which I know for sure are fentanyl because have used a test kit on quite a few.

I have been using these daily for about 3 months. During which time my tolerance and dependence has skyrocketed. 

I just got my best friend from back home to hook me up with some Suboxone ( wish it was Subutex but Beggars can't be picky). It is time to kick the habit, it's a dangerous and very expensive one.

I have never been hooked on fent and have no clue how long to wait before taking a suboxone. So my question is how long to wait after the last dose of fent before I take the sub? 

I definitely do not want to end up in precipitated withdrawals..

I only have five 8 mg Subs and would also love some advice on best way to take / taper off with them.

I have Sunday off but work Monday through Friday next week and cannot be a useless mofo. 

Any advice would be awesome.

Summary : have been using fent Daily for 3 to 4 months. Got 5 Suboxone strips. How long to wait to take to avoid withdrawals, and any advice on correct / best taper ?

Thanks guys

Weve all been there take your whatever dose and an hour and a half later you want to take more, so you do and the high is non existent or underwhelming. Oxycodone needs at least 8 hours between doses to feel the effect, or wait till you get wd symtoms and the high will be even better. 

For Me aswell there is a ceiling dose of 80mg/day, if i use anymore than that i wont get high anymore.Everyone has this my friends and i call it the point of no return when you use to much and wont get high off your normal dose anymore.

Posting from a throwaway. I found 17 pills in a little ziploc baggie in between the trash can and the trash bag in a public restroom in the retail store I work at. Google tells me they're Purdue 2mg Dilaudid (hydromorphone). In accordance with the rules of this sub I removed the pictures and i am not asking anybody here to verify the pills that I have found. I will go a little deeper into the sidebar and pick up a more accurate scale before I make any decision. At the first sign of bootlegery they will be promptly destroyed. I am curious though about fake pills in general. I live within walking distance of one of the big big heroin/fent cities on the east coast, and have to deal with straight up fiends on a daily basis. From my kind of outsider point of view, heroin seems to be vastly more popular around here. In this kind of environment, are fake pills more common, or less common due to less demand? Once again this has no bearing on what i found today just curious. 

I dabbled with opiates in my teens and early 20s, mostly percs and lower mg oxy (or whatever was around in the mid 00s) and never developed a habit. Never did IV, mostly sniffed or chewed. Aside from 2 legit scrips for vicodin for dental work, I haven't done any opiates in a decade. When I got the scrips, I would take more than i needed on the first day or two, definitely beyond what the doc would have recommended,  but never had any withdrawal symptoms afterward. I like the high, but am very aware of the risks of getting hooked. Addiction runs in my family, I fought with alcoholism for years (3yrs sober). 

So here is my plan with these pills and I would like your opinion. I leave for vacation tomorrow. I am not taking them with me. That way I have a few days to look at your responses and be somewhat responsible. I got a few days off between vacation and work, so I will act then. I am going to give most of them away. I have somebody in mind but I don't know if giving him that much at once is too much. I'm pretty sure he's not a heavy user, and  he is experienced. I don't think it would be enough,  but that's why i'm asking you. I fairly certain he is not an IV user, I think that makes a big difference) 

I want to save 2-3 for the first aid kit. I also plan on saving one recreational dose, enough to keep me comfortably numb for the evening. Going to wait to party until after I give the others away, that way if I really do like them, I can't just blast through the whole pile. I know I said I live real close to a real big drug city but i don't know what block to go down or who or what to ask for. I haven't bought drugs on a street corner in a very long time. Unless I really overdo it I don't see this happening. I can handle being sick for a few days, I did it with alcohol on multiple occasions. Difference is i didn't know i was an alcoholic until it was too late.  

**TLDR/Questions**


1. Do you think dropping ~10 of these on my buddy's lap going to be too much of a good thing? Again, i think he'd be ok, he has a really good temperment and i never seen him nod or all whacked out... just looking for some opinions. 


4. Recommended recreational dose and ROA (no iv)? Enough for one night, . I'm 30s male 155lbs 5'8"" i have tried lower to mid strength opiates on many occasions in the past but never developed a habit. Daily cannabis, caffeine, nicotine user. no alcohol. I did read the sidebar, but it was a little too much for me to grasp with any confidence.


5. Street value?


6. Am I an idiot and this is all a bad idea? I found them in the trash ffs...


7. Actually, I found them *hidden* underneath the trash bag. What do you think that was about? Since i'm on vacation i won't be able to see if on of my fellow employees loses his mind or calls out sick, or if it was some paranoid customer hiding his shit then he forgot it. Maybe a dead drop and I fucked up somebody's pickup? terrible place to hide that much stuff. but i'm on vacation....😎🍍🌴

""I'm so sick and tired of being sick and tired."" - we all feel this shit. Even when we've had a good high that day... It doesn't last forever. We have to wake up and face the music. Sure we have great binges, it's what keeps us consumed in the darkness... And happily willing to risk it all for them. But, I have to overcome the slavery. The chains are becoming weaker and I'm getting stronger every day. It's possible.

Day #3 after a small week relapse. I was on day #11before that. It happens and honestly I needed the dopamine boost to overcome my paws depression I was sinking into. I went on walks today. I genuinely laughed. I was able to function, handle tasks, with patience and not give into the fire of overwhelming irritability that has been unleashing the wrath of hell on those around me. It's happening, and tbh I didn't even really want to quit, but I'm becoming more and more motivated with each milestone I hit. 

I'm not going to be blindsided by the depression and suicidal ideations from paws this time. I'm ready for it, and if I have to take another break then so be it. Don't beat yourselves up for making a mistake... Find the pros and fucking embrace the positives. It is all we have... Unless we decided to let that demon grab our leg and pull us right back to the hell we are all so comfortable in. Guess what? It fucking sucks down here. It's hot, we're all sweating our asses off, drying up from the inside out, our thoughts are engulfed by one thing and one thing only, and it's become our end goal. There is nothing else beyond our DOC when we are stuck in the viscous cycle. 

Are you even happy? I wasnt. I remember the natural dopamine. I remember waking up and my first thought being coffee... Not how the fuck am I going to score, Counting my pills, popping whatever I have in my safety stash to avoid being sick, counting the hours before I should dose next, attempting to taper and then getting to that time and popping more than I should, then the regret fucks my high and I'm left anxious. Ffs. I really hate the lifestyle. Love the high, but I'm not a fucking slave.

The warmth Ive come to love feeling is fake... I've been hunched over in the middle of a fucking blizzard with a box of matches... And I'm all out. I swear that little light I get a glimpse of is warmer than ever. I want it.

This is a comment I left for someone but I feel this advice deserves it's own post!!,"Find a new Dr, one that operates a private practice, one that does not work for an office owned and operated by a giant health conglomerate business. They tend to have new policies in place to keep the Dr out of trouble and since they service so many patients they typically have a high number of prescriptions being written which keeps the FDA/DEA all up their ass all the time. My Dr runs his own practice and is the only physician working from it. Also, most middle age docs don't like to prescribe **(IME)** since they have so much to lose and they just care about the money for the most part, that's why they love those 20K epidural steroid injections that actually made my DDD much much much worse and gave me sciatica in addition to the pain I was already barely managing. Older physicians mostly care about their patients more and younger ones are trying to establish themselves and are willing to do more to help the patient in general. They will also do something ""risky"" like giving opioids for pain (risky my fucking ass, this manufactured opioid crisis is killing good people in pain) because they have not been disillusioned by the people who come in for blues or opanas from a sprained toe... If you have legitimate documented issues so you should have no issues getting treated.

Since I have done this I have a script that works. Cost me $2500 a year for the Dr visit, its it's called Concierge Service look for one in your area, it may help you. $2500 is a small price to pay for a year of pleasant productive Dr visits that actually help me.  I was referred by my psych Dr but you could most likely find one without a referral then see if they take your insurance, if they do great! Tell your GP to write you a referral to him/her and if not, just eat the cost. 0 hassle getting my meds and even increasing dosages. My Dr actually cares about me and even raised dosages no issues just a few questions etc etc. He just reviewed my medical history, consulted my xray and MRIs, discussed a plan for future surgeries and treatments and that was it!

This visit my Doc raised me from 3 OP 40s a day to 3 OP 60s a day and 2 10mg IR opana to 3 10mg IR opana with just a few questions asked. I just honestly explained how I was feeling and how the new dosage would help.  My Dr's only concern is I stay at/under 200MG a day (currently at 210 I guess but NBD to him), not Morphine equivalent MG, just MG period as I am waaaaaaay over 200 Morphine equivalent MG. I also have an established tolerance due to many surgeries and injuries so do NOT expect to start that high.... I just get seen once every 3 months and get 3 months of meds written at a time, no drug tests, no BS pain clinic madness, no injections, no pill counts, no forced CBT. My Dr even said I should get a medical marijuana card to help with the pain... I have even been prescribed subs before in the same state that my Dr operates and no issues. The red flag thing is a myth I believe as I have even been to a rehab before (to get off pain meds from a previous procedure)  and no one cares. I have been written scripts from dentists, pain management, oral surgeons,surgeon, and GPs with this in my medical file. Dr will generally treat LEGITIMATE pain. They can tell when someone is full of shit. If you are faking though, there are some good tutorials on YouTube showing what Dr look for when seeing how much in pain you are, look them up.

I now have a script for 90 OP 60s and 90 IR 10 opanas, also have 20mg of Valium (from my psych) a day prescribed and no issues. I have to travel an hour there and and hour back for my appointments but that is a small price to pay.

It took me going through my GP, then a pain clinic that made my issues worse with injections, PT and a tens unit, bupe  and tramadol for pain which didn't work. I also had an oral surgery and was prescribed 15 5/325 hydro for the pain, did nothing obviously.... That caused me to seek out the new Dr and now I couldn't be happier.

&#x200B;

Sorry for the wall of text, but when people post like you did I just like to share my story so they can see that there is hope, do NOT give up or go to the streets, go to google or duckduckgo (much better when searching for anything drug related since google now censors) and check it out. I really hope you read this and others do as well and I hope it helps... If it does let me know so I can feel good about helping someone lol. Good luck!

EDIT:  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concierge\_medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concierge_medicine) Look for this type of Dr in your area

 And use a mom and pop pharmacy for your meds so you are not discriminated against. They typically want your business and more likely to treat you with compassion as opposed to scum of the earth.

Longest I've been clean from oxy in over a year. I'm almost over the withdrawals, other then having a little bit of RLS, but if I take a bit of Kratom then that is gone. 

So to the point of the post, I have seen several people say that if you take a low enough dose of Suboxone you can get high, I'm not looking to nod, just want a bit of euphoria. When I take oxy I can usually get decent euphoria off of 25-30 mg of oxy. I was looking at the opioid dosing chart and see that Suboxone/Bupe is about 40 times as strong as hydrocodone and so itd make Bupe about 27 times as strong as Oxycodone. So in theory 1 mg of Sub would be as strong as 27 mg of Oxy.

3:30.

Like clockwork I receive my weekly pay in cash. 440 dollars. The scent of the pvc and lumber lingers in my nose as the tension in my stomach begins to grow.  I can’t be bothered to go shower. I sit and wait. This anxiety pulsing like a dying star in the pit of my abdomen. Soon I will be picked up and taken to my friends house, where the usual 4 little treats wait for me. 

Except this time it’s 6. Fentanyl. Pressed into cute little blues. This is the highlight of my week, the thing I look forward to every week. The thing that keeps me going. 

And I hate it.

I need to get off this shit and prior to my relapse I had stayed in s medical detox facility for 8 days and went through 6 days of straight insomnia afterwards before I felt better. 

I cant go back to detox. I dont have the financial means or health insurance. My buddy gets a prescription for 8mg subutex and I have 3 quarters of one already. I have no idea how I should taper myself with the subutex. I also use kratom daily when I'm not on an opiate binge. I can probably buy some Korean subutex from my friend. In detox they gave me 4mg the first 2 days morning and night then 2mg morning and night the next two days then I suffered for the following 4. I feel that taper was too quick and i need something that will make the insomnia less brutal. 

I feel like if i have a detox plan mapped out I'll be able to commit and get the fuck off this horrible shit again. I'm in a financial situation where I absolutely cannot be using everyday but here I am.

Basically, our society is too safe. In shaman based communities they regularly face epidemics and injury that we avoid. When 20,000 die to a particular cause and yet a couple barely survive, having come close to death, those people become the shamans. Having danced with death and returned against great odds is what qualifies one to shamanism. We don't have many analogous situations in the 1st world. But running the streets shooting dope / fentanyl seems pretty spot on to me. I found my way out of 23 yrs of addiction, 14 of them on the needle, through plant medicines among many other things. Dmt, mushrooms, Syrian rue, etc. Not only the way out of addiction but also a way into the best and only journey worth addressing. The journey inside. Where the real conflict exists and so too does the real and lasting resolution. Just food for thought. I did 12 steps very seriously for a year and a half, lots of spiritual seeking, meditation, etc. Plant medicines were a big part too though.

Just like in that experiment with the morphine and the rats. But anyway, today, as I watch T crumble as her daughter got arrested (she's already on parole so she is definitely going back to jail for any infraction or violation at this point), I grabbed onto T and told her it would be okay and that I loved her.  


And truthfully, I do love her. She and her husband do my dirty work for me basically. They take the bigger risk, selling to me than I do buying from them. Do I love her because I am using her? I don't think so. These are genuine feelings from a genuine person. I spend my TIME with these people, real time because we don't act like strangers. We all know what each other fixes on. We hang out and we live in that mucky house with each other because we *understand* each other. Now, I say mucky house, and I mean **mucky.** This place is never clean. The couple I buy from live there with two of three of T's children with another man. The kid(s) (now that B just got arrested again idk if I should really say it plural) but anyhow J & B (the kids of the house) did their share of dirty work to keep the place clean so they weren't so embarrassed to have friends over. J will continue to clean what he can, he's kind like that. He cares. He smokes pot, bless his little heart. He hasn't fucked with any of the shit we know now that we never shoulda fucked with, am I right? Anyway, I'm trying to paint a fucking picture of this trailer for you guys, do you see it yet?

&#x200B;

Okay.   


Anyway, we spend our fucking time together, doing what we do best, *together,* and is it a fucked up dynamic? You fucking  bet dude. It's unapologetic in there. We have no sorrow or regret, we all know that we love something more than each other and it's okay with us.... **WE KNOW.** We literally know each other's every move, dirty little secret, because we aren't afraid of hiding. And is that what we're all hiding from....? We are all hiding bits and pieces of our lives from the normies in our lives because we know that they usually have a lesser opinion of us. But I know so many people like me, who use drugs, and they are fucking brilliant, man. Brilliant. Some of the smartest people I know also have NEVER used drugs. Some have. The difference is that the people who have dipped their feet in the opipool, we already felt that hook. That pull to love something more than yourself. Holy shit I need to fix the way this sounds.... **(*****DISCLAIMER:*** *this is not to romanticize drugs, these are just my personal feelings written out, if you haven't done this drug do not turn anything I am saying as a reason to try opiates, I ruined my entire fucking life.***)** The difference is, we have felt it. And we can relate to one another. We can ACTUALLY relate to how the other feels. Because when it's gone, it makes you physically ill and most people cannot imagine what it feels like... to have something ripped away and when it is to so quickly turn violently ill. Most people have never endured it to the point where... they can't even IMAGINE it, they couldn't fathom the way that feels. But in that shitty fucking house we all help make sure that no one ever gets ill. We help each other. We do. I mean it's really that fucking simple. And I think that honestly the few times I've been robbed there are because for some reason they were afraid to ask. But I still go back. Because I understand those people. And I know what it's like to need. And I know they'd never get violent with me over it, but I just try to remind myself I would have helped them anyway, and just not get mad over it. When time comes, they will get me back. Hell, he's given me deals a few times which I am sure were just at cost really, but whatever. The point is, I can see why a person does some things wrong. I understand that humans re capable of being so passionate for something, that they'd do something crazy to get it. It's like pavlov's dogs. It's exactly the same. We are conditioned and it's that simple. We understand what it's like to feel like nothing but a machine, 1) get drugs 2) use drugs 3) function and act human through the day 4) nod the fuck out and destroy that reminder that you played pretend all day, and just like that *a well oiled machine.* 

&#x200B;

I thought I was referring to myself as an overfeeler and didn't want to romanticize drug use and now I'm referring to myself as a literal robot so idk where I was ever actually going with this. But my point is, I may be a robot, but I do still have feelings. I am not completely lost. None of us are. But we are lost. We are still walking aimlessly with nowhere to go right now. Because the traditional paycheck to paycheck user doesn't have a savings account. There's nowhere we can just ""pick up and pack our bags to"". There's nothing beyond the place we have now, in all it's mucky glory, and each other. So how do you get out? I mean really. Where can I go besides an expensive ass rehab that I'll never be able to afford? I mean the problem with addiction is that there aren't enough CHEAP resources for help. It's been hundreds of years since they used milk of the poppy for healing remedies. We've known for years what it can do to destroy you and no one has put anything in effort to make this stop? Instead of finding a way to rehabilitate people we find a cure. Idfk what I'm saying. I'm certain I'm talking nonsense now because I don't know what we could do. But maybe making people more socially aware and just not so judgemental and, you know, then we could ALL live our truths. I know that's bullshit. I know there will always be the negative people that can pick the side to look down on us as ""scum"", because I hear users referred to as this for the longest time, so I know that's what people think... but maybe it's not the same. Maybe since they don't know what it's like to need something so badly so they can't picture the alternative that it's just not possible for them to feel that deep of empathy for us either? I guess I can even understand that. 

&#x200B;

It's a weird fucking world out there today. A weird fucking world. And I wish I knew more every day. And I think I know a decent amount. But I learn every day. Being a user has not taken that from me. I still want to learn every day. I want to see more perspectives every day. I want to pay more attention to everyone's emotions and body language every day so I can be there, as a human. I want so much more and maybe when I do finally gain my sobriety, maybe before that time, I can understand others and read them so well that I can be there for them. My ultimate goal is to be there for others and help them through whatever phase of life they need it. I want the material stuff too, a home, a dog and a yard, love of my life, I want that shit too I mean, fuck yeah I do. I want the white picket fence and EVERYTHING. I want a nice place that's clean to call my own. And maybe I'll get there. I really fucking hope I get there. ",1538750365.0

Or is the DEA evil for cracking down on them? Seems kind of hypocritical.,"I brought this up before and got highly downvoted, I'd like to have a discussion on it. I can't be the only one that finds it incredibly hypocritical that there seems to be a big trend in online drug communities to hold two views: 

&#x200B;

1) That doctors/purdue/big pharma are all evil for pushing opiates in the late 90s/early 2000s so hard. Personally I think you could maybe describe it as predatory but I believe in personal responsibility. For a community that preaches personal responsibility with drugs so hard I think it's odd people hop on the victim-politics band wagon with this one. Adults should know that opiates are addicting. I'm no fucking genius but I remember knowing what addiction and dependence were when I was young, and that opium almost ruined china, etc. I don't understand people that get prescribed a medication and don't even research it. I think most people on this sub would agree with me on personal responsibility but suddenly when it comes to prescribing pills we're somehow no longer at fault. I personally blame treatment centers for pushing this ""iTz NoT uR FaulT\~\~"" narrative. 

&#x200B;

2. DEA is evil for cracking down on pain med prescriptions. Now I didn't agree with #1 but I do agree with this one. My point is that I don't see how 1 and 2 mesh. It seems like you if you believe that you just want to play both sides of the fence and not take responsibility for your own addiction.  


I'm not saying I'm right and everyone else is wrong, I'm just curious what other peoples views are on this. I personally started abusing opiates when I was 15 after being prescribed 30 days of hydro. I didn't need that much hydro and I think a lot of people would blame the doctor, but I knew I didn't really need that shit, that it would get me high, that I could get withdrawals...",1538745480.0

So I came across 2 full and 2 mostly empty blister packets of these tablets, which are go by the tradename ""Meptid"".  

There is next to no information about them on the internet, as far as I've found so far that is anyway. Oh! I just remembered that it's been suggested to search things on Bing now rather than Google isn't that right? Derp, will get on that after I post this and see what I can dig up over there!  

  

Anyway I was wondering whether any of my good fellows on this sub have any experience with these bad boys- well, you can bet your ass that I'm hoping that they're ""bad boys"" haha y'all know it!  

I came cross one old Reddit post last night discussing it and by all accounts, they sounded pretty lame in that discussion.  

But if they are the tablets my sister told me the doctor gave her when she messed up her Subutex prescription and went into WD's earlier this year- very weird situation am I right?- they might be good because she said they made her gouch; that is to say, they made her nod big time! So if they made her nod, surely they're going to be enjoyable right?  

They're 200mg, red and oval shaped hard pills which are white inside. I took one last night, but the results were negligible if anything because I'd done nearly a half a teenth of gear smoked and shot in the hours preceding it, so wasn't sure if anything I felt was that or the tablet I took. I knew it was pointless to bother but the fiend in me got his way and I took one.  

  

The gear alone made sure that I barely slept last night too, so now I'm pretty tired and could probably get straight to sleep if I go and try. I may just do that. I don't know when my opiate receptors will be sufficiently empty to be properly able to judge the effect of these tablets so yeah guys, over to you on this one!

On what kind of stomach should I take it and will 30mg be enough ? I want to get really high so hope that the dosage is fine. My experience with snorting was not intense at all so I hope that will change when taking it oral.

On the other spectrum, there is the option of seeing a pain management doctor. They drug test, and look at your history. You might get a script for Percocet.

But it's the fact that you get drug tested.

That drives pain doctor's patients away if they fail them.

He wont even change it for me

I tell him the Tramadol works, but only sometimes, and it does kill all of the pain, and he gives me LESS tramadol than last time?


Im just really sick of being treated like a fucking junkie because i take Suboxone. If i did have an opioid abuse problem, it was so fucking long ago that i dont even remember it. :|

Even if i was a junkie, hes not entitled to do this to me


His assistant, a younger woman, was much nicer to me, said i could have any muscle relaxer i wanted, and she gave me 90 of them. 

I am relly beginning to believe that these doctors just refer you to other people so they do not have to deal with you

I HAVE FOLLOWED MY DOCTORS INSTRUCTIONS AND CONTINUE TO FOLLOW HIS INSTRUCTIONS

but my point is that i cannot rely on this man for anything

i asked him for suppositories for my bleeding rectum and he wouldn't give them to me until i called him crying from all these fucking problems that i have because i dont know what to deal with first


So im doing as follows:

Pain management - Triggerpoint injections and whatver they have to offer

-

Chiropractor, Accupuncture, Phys therapy

I feel like i need a neurologist that specializes in facial pain. 


We have conclude that i may not actually have TMJ but imay have something stemming from a neck injury. Its very very hard 


I can barely even talk to people and these fucking people shrug it off and everytime is ee a doctor i am STRAINING myself to talk to them. i want to go to the fuckin gemergency room everyday and these people barely fucking listen to me 


So now i have gotten to the point where i may begin recording these doctor interactions and poting them online as this shouldn't happen to anyone whether they're a fucking junnkie or not this is just horrendous healthcare opioid bullshit

i didn't ask him for the tramadol btw

but i did tell him that i haven't used drugs in over 10 years . and that im very proud of it . but obviously he doesnt give a fucking shit

my dentist was more willing to prescribe something to relieve pain

these people are fucking assholes

only like maybe 2 out of 10 doctors were legitimately careing . and those doctors are not my personal doctors but people that i wound up seeing over the course of trying to treat whatever the fuck i got going on

Originally i was diagnosed with fibromyalgia

Then TMJ

and now...? Neck tumors? i have no fucking idea . the MRI was EXTREMELY painful. They removed any cushion available and stuck a rod in my mouth which i then had to open a very small amount everytime they took the photo . since then the pain has been off the charts and i wake up screaming and i am scaring my family

i even told the doctor this and he just doesnt give a fuck

i am considering changing my primary doctor to a suboxone doctor because atleast the suboxone doctor would fukcing listen to me

but i already have a great suboxone doctor , he just doesnt go into the areas of pain, he would give me lyrica, but its not covered by insurance, i do feel like lyrica could help me, just very expensive


i've spent over $1000 on ointments, ive spent over $900 on a piece of shit bite guard that doesnt work at all.

im wasting money 

could have probably bought 10 oxycontin and legitimately have felt better by actually taking the pain away. keep in mind i only type this because i feel as if i am actually legitimately beginning to get depressed . ive tried so hard to keep my head up but it is impossible when everyone is against you no matter waht you do in life!",1538709524.0

Ive been taking extremely low amounts of Suboxone.

In combination with a decent diet.

I am in extreme pain , as you may know.

But, my doseage has always gone down because i have been able to keep my anxiety down.

But within the past couple of days, my anxiety went crazy!

As i seem to be getting no help for my pain problem, as i am looked at like a junkie

TL;DR: I required more suboxone / bupe under stress than not being in stress. even taking two or three times as much did nothing. infact, it may be counterproductive

Please be aware that your stress and anxiety level will effect your doseages

Please.

I wish i knew this 10 years ago

That running around the house, fixing shit, while in pain, and having anxiety, thinking about 30 different things at once, you're not thinking about relaxing. you're not allowing yourself the relaxation so that your body can feel that drug that you're taking

I realize most people will be like ""THATS A BUNCH OF BULLSHIT""

Similar to my previous posts on health, diet, & doseage.

But maybe this will help 1 person that wants to lower their dose:

Keep a good diet, a great diet (if you're shitting bricks that is horrible. )

And take small amounts

And try to remain stress free or go into a zen mode!

Trust me that the meds will be far more effective

I do not have anything else to say other than, i have now seen Drs, whom have referred me to other doctors, each of which says something different is wrong with me . ive pretty much given up hope of doctors , as its too stressful to think about.


but yea. this is me. this is how i feel after  15 years of taking opiates and 11 years of ONLY suboxone . 

The only med other than Suboxone that i have touched, which was recently, was Tramadol , which was prescribed to me for extreme pain  .

I’m extremely new to dope iv done it a handful of times over the past few months of some ECP snorting only, I don’t know how addictive it could be compared to oxys. Just wanna know what I would be getting myself into and if it’s possible to only use a few times a week. ",1538707029.0

Both my plugs randomly have just disappeared and won't pick up either phone. Heard from someone one of them got busted (its 4 guys) and that they changed the number and they usually call people when this happens and give them the new number. Obviously since I'm not a constant user that calls them all the time I did not get a call for the new numbers. 

Went down by the safe injection site someone said they could do 4 bags for 100. I should have only bought like 25$-50$ that way it wouldnt have been such a big deal I was just desperate and not thinking. So the person even let me see the bag and it looked normal just more white which stuff goes around that is white like this that is buffed fent. Go and check it out and of course it's some vitamin shit like taurine. Made alot of sense afterwards why the person sealed the top of the bag so crazy. Obviously I was annoyed but I dunno I dont pay rent currently so it isn't the end of the world. Also thankfully after the fact I found the girl who had served me purple dope the other day and we went on adventure to go cop and the 50 I spent with her was actually a proper 2 points and decent quality stuff ( not purple or coloured seems less fenty) even though she said she didn't like this batch and usually gets better. 

At least I found a middle that's always downtown by the safe injection site. Doesnt have a phone but she should get one in a few days. Honestly maybe it was worth getting burned 100 to get a decent relationship with this connect considering she used my phone and had tons of dealers. I would call them but I can tell her dealers need a referral and I would get chewed out for calling and the middle might get told and then I'm screwed. 

Doesn't really matter anyways because her prices are a lil better then average. Cant say today was the worst at least I got home and had a couple points to snort and this stuff isnt getting effected by the 45mg of methadone I'm on. ",1538705621.0

I had a drug test at my doctors office to make sure I didn't test for anything off the wall or illicit. They're sending the results to a lab for full evaluation. So, me being me, and being super paranoid about random drugs showing up tests herself with one of her dori instant tests at home.

I came up positive for exactly what I thought I would:

* THC - likely a low level of it since I rarely EVER smoke & am in a legal state
* Benzos - Duh, I've been on valium post op
* Opiates - Yes, I've been on those consistently, since surgery but will be out in a day or two. MmmmK.
* Suboxone was inconclusive .... my last dose was 45 days ago so likely a non issue.

Here's where I'm concerned:

Methadone. I tested fucking positive for methadone. I would fly to australia if someone put methadone in front of me so I KNOW it's a false positive. What I don't know is if lab testing will reveal that or ??? I've scoured the web looking for things that can cause a false methadone positive and so far the only thing that came up that it MIGHT be the benadryl. With that said, the only other thing i can think of is that it must've been in the heroin I tried 67 days ago but I highly doubt it would be THAT long lasting in my system?

To protect myself from the chance that my medical records were examined by the court I'd prefer that there was no mention of anything H related. 

If I do tell the dr. I am on MMT I wonder if he would give me more pain meds to break thru and actually relieve the pain or if he'd take the other route and assume the methadone would work for my post op pain and not want to risk prescribing an addict any more opiates than he had to

Not to mention I miss the warmth, even though the feelings aren't as amazing as they used to be.

Here's the backstory: introduced to percocet 15yrs ago, absolutely loved it. I felt energized, productive, happy, it was amazing. Ive been chasing this high for years, but haven't felt it in at least 5yrs. After 5 straight years of percocet, morphine and oxy I felt it took over my life and I decided I had to quit. Cold turkey quit, counting every hour and marking them down in a notebook (attempting to feel accomplished every hour I abstained) and felt like dying. I did use weed and lots of hot showers and music to get through. I did it, and stayed clean for probably a year.

After a year, my brain remebered the amazingness and I relapsed. Blah blah same shit until I couldn't get percs anymore and started with the oxys. I loved them. Used another year and quit again for 2 years. Started back up after an injury and haven't once had that energizing, productive, warm high ive been chasing. I've just been feeling so unmotivated, don't even want to get out of bed, just nod, wake up and medicate, only to nod more... All day.

So... My brain is stuck remembering how amazing it once was, I justify taking another because at this point I just want to sleep and feel happy/relaxed, but what's the point? I know I won't get that awesome high I used to, I know I won't feel motivated and generally ""better"" at all, I'll have to reset AGAIN, and I'm not even really happy when I take them anymore. So why the hell do I want to so bad? 

Also, I did a reset 2 weeks ago and went 11days before the depression and suicidal thoughts made me relapse. Scary shit. So I went a week taking 10mg a day and now I'm back to 2 days clean. Well, 40.5 hours clean.",1538688714.0

*Before that: On and Off Use of 10 to 15 Grams since November 17.*

I certainly did. In fact, when I went into substitution and they asked me for my family history followed by my personal history of drugs (first time trying weed, first time speed, coke, MDMA, etc) I realised for the first time properly just how much I fulfilled the classic pattern of an addict: exposed to drugs at an incredibly young age, tried each new one at a younger age than others around me, used other substances compulsively, genes inherited from a long line of addicts, abusive home life that included trauma I wasn't really able to handle on my own but for a long time didn't even truly understand or recognise...In fact, it's only recently that I realised that I was a poster child for addiction - a close family member was giving me amphetamines when I was fucking 10 years old, and I first had a line of coke aged 12. In that context, it's a miracle I only tried smack when I was 23 and after having graduated from university...

Anyway, apologies for the slightly drug-addled detour. The reason I'm posting is because having gone pretty much directly to heroin, the only withdrawals I know are from smack or substitution. I'm not sure which is worse; methadone is milder but it last forever compared to heroin and both turn me into a desperate insomniac for months. But I've never had to go cold turkey from fentanyl, dilaudid, oxycodone or any other pharmaceutical opiates.

Are they different from coming off heroin? Easier? Worse? I'd like to know. For what it's worth, I lived for a while in New York and took oxys there but not enough to get hooked on them specifically - I was taking ECP as well. When I binged on oxys (snorting them), I'd get a horrible headache that I never experienced from smack. The high, in general, felt artificial in a way that I'd never experienced before. I read a lot of posts here where people describe unpleasant symptoms that I associate with oxys but not heroin - headaches, neuralgia, migraines, troubled dreams...

So - right - what I'm wondering is: are withdrawals from synthetic opiates different from coming off heroin and, if so, in what way? If you had to (and I mean had to) choose one opiate to come off, which would it be? And, conversely, if you have one you never want to come off cold turkey, which is it?

(From what I've heard, coming off fentanyl addiction sounds especially hellish. It's just appearing where I live and I'm coming across fent addicts for the first time. From what they say, the high is intense but it doesn't hold as long as heroin so they're using 2-3 times as often and when they don't, they start clucking really fast, rather than the slow onset you get from smack...It sounds like a nightmare!)",1538680669.0

About eleven years ago I had a decent (about a year) run with different pills. Mostly methadone and morphine.. occasionally codeine, oc, Vicodin, that sort of stuff. At the high point was doing about 20-30mg of 'done daily with the occasional 100mgs or so of morphine mixed in.

Since then I still dabble from time to time, but this past year I have been a dipping in a bit more again. Once a month I'll grab a dozen 'dones and and a dozen norcs (both 10mg). I generally try to keep my dosing limited to the weekends, but I'm not always successful at that. I don't do more than one of each at a time (if I do take some during the week it is usually half of each one), and to be honest my tolerance doesn't seem to grow much; these small doses have worked for me and continue to. Although I'm also one of those rarities that can catch a buzz from 50mg of tramadol.

I read through posts here, and I understand everyone is different, but it makes me question the true nature of my relationship with these substances. I feel like if I even doubled the dose I'm accustomed to I would become unusable - is that what the average user is chasing here? What I'm seeking is that instilled sense of well-being that rarely comes out without the application of pharms (sometimes from kratom). I mean the body buzz is certainly nice but it is that sprinkle of euphoria that I am really after.

Am I trying to address something that could be better approached by something else? Something that I don't need to lie about to my fiance? She knows about my past, but it would break her heart to know I still feel like I need something like this.",1538659682.0

In total I snorted about 50mg of the powder. During a few hours I felt what I guess is a typical heroin high, nodding out a few times but always using my phone (I guess that means I didn’t OD). But instead of gently subsiding like I heard it should have, it seemed to have progressively intensified while the positive aspects disappeared. I was overwhelmed with intense nausea and vertigo every time I tried to move, until I had to throw up in a bucket at about midnight: this seems to have made things better but the symptoms didn’t subside. I managed to sleep for a few hours with some interruptions, but now, although I’m feeling better, I’m still feeling the nausea and vertigos. It’s 7:00 am now.

I’m thinking that maybe this is the result of the interaction between ketamine and heroin. Does somebody know what else it could be?

I know that ive completely ruined my life chasing this high, and nothing but negativity comes from it, but i'm still doing it. It's been almost 4 years since i got hooked. During one sober period i was so fucking determined to stop. I used to go by the thought that 'you have to want to quit more than you want to get high'... And i was so fucking sure that i reached that point. I was for sure that the life i was living was nothing but misery... & i turned it around and started putting the pieces back where they were supposed to be.

 Then life hit. 

One terrible mishap after another. I watched my cat slowly die, after the vets told me he would pull through. I was crushed, did everything i possibly could. I still kept clean. Had to pay extra money to keep my apartment, leaving me completely broke and hungry for weeks, still kept clean. Went through the worst heartbreak ive ever been through... Kept clean. Then one day the urge was just too much for me to handle. I broke. 

Started using again. Took me about 3 weeks to lose my apartment and move back to my moms, 500 miles away. Again i reached that point. That ""i want to get sober more than i want to get high"" thought. Went 3 weeks clean and then got hit with a court date back in the state i was living in. Worked things out with my dad and moved back in with him so i could get my court fines paid off & everything. I was so determined... Sooooo fucking determined that when i got back, i wouldnt go straight to my plug to get more dope. 

After the drive and sleeping it off, it took me about an hour to cave in and hit up the plug. Well.... Now 2 months later im still hooked. My dad kicked me out, i owe a good friend 350 dollars cause i tried to make a quick buck middlemanning and the buyer gave her fake hundreds. Once again, ive hit rock bottom.

Theres so much more to the story i can't fit in. I've done some things that make me want to kill myself just from the remorse it caused. I am such a fucking terrible person. I never was this total lowlife until i got hooked. I had everything going for me. I didnt know it at the time, but before i was hooked i was happy. Life was good. I would give everything to go back to the point where i was taking everything for granted. Yet i cant.

Im still stuck. Life has gotten far worse than i thought was even possible. Yet every... Fucking... Day... My first thought is how the fuck am i going to not be sick today? I don't feel like it's possible to get clean anymore because everytime i pick the pieces back up, i just go right back to the miserable lifestyle i was in.

I know it's all in my head. I know it's just urges that drive me. I know it's not near as glamorous as i lead myself to believe. So why? Why can't i escape? Why do i lead myself back to the path i was on? The answer to me is simple. My brain is wired to chase dopamine. No other thing in this world gives you dopamine like opiates do. Your sub-conscious doesnt care how bad it gets, it knows how much dopamine gets released when you get high.

Some people overcome this. How??? What the fuck? I dont get it? The only explanations i can come up with are that either they are only saying theyre clean to convince others to get clean or they arent nearly as predisposed to addiction as i am. Im sure both of those kinds of people exist in the world, but what about the people like me? 

I know i am strong. I have overcame things that normal people never could handle. Ive lived through things (before my addiction) that would have forced other people to opt the easy way out. Im a fucking survivor at heart. I know this to be a fact. Yet... I dont know if i can survive this hurdle. I don't know if i can get sober. I don't know if life is worth living. I thought i had it all figured out, time and time again... Yet i keep coming back. 

What the fuck am i supposed to do?

I came to possess 3 vials of 2mg/mL of Lorazepam for IM or IV use (Ativan)
all the stuff about how to administer it results in clinical settings or nurse how to tutorials. I don't have luerlock or any catheters or saline flush or dilutant. What I do have readily is access to standard BD insulin 1cc 1/2 in syringes.

Again to spell out my question..
1. Will I be able to appropriately IM using 1cc 1/2 in syringe or will that result in a subcutaneous injection?
2. Instructions on the vial say to prep for injection by diluting the drug 1:1 but since my syringes are only 1cc its a bit tricky to have that much fluid. Is it ok to inject IM or IV ativan undiluted? Is it caustic? The fluid is slighty viscid when cooled.

Any other information that can warn/reduce my harm to self regarding IM/IV administration of Ativan will be appreciated also.

My question is, if done under very sterile conditions could I successfully take care of this one with only a couple days worth of antibiotics? I understand it's dangerous to not finish an entire cycle of Antibiotics - so I'm wondering if I should even give her what we have left to begin with. (10 Cephalexin 500mg & 6 Bactrin DS 160mg).

I'm a snorter, i've never smoked or shot H. But essentially what happens these days is my heart rate drops dramatically compared to what it used to whenever I'd do H, i'm talking 40-50bpm here And this comes along with all the typical effects except for euphoria. I can nod, my pupils get pinned as fuck, i get itchy, the whole deal. all without euphoria. the strange thing is that this only happens with heroin. if I use oxy or another opioid, i get euphoria. what the fuck is going on here? did I manage to subconciously condition my body into not liking heroin anymore since I overdosed? also, i can confirm i'm using legitimate H. I've tried several different sources too, and I've tested every single one. all legit, no fent, no nothing. Just H. and yet here we are, me struggling to enjoy fucking heroin. 

I was thinking of trying to smoke it to see if it'd have a different effect but I'm not entirely sure what i wanna do yet. Does anybody here have any insight as to what might be going on here?

For the majority of the time, I simply took 10mg of Oxycodone 1-3 times a day depending on my pain.

&#x200B;

 I am a 21-year old male that weighs \~130lbs. Through my hospital stay and now out of the hospital, I have definitely felt the Oxycodone have less ""effects"" (although it still easily controls my pain). Overall, I've been taking the Oxycodone for maybe 2-3 weeks, daily. Dosage goes from 10 to 30mg per day, depending on how bad my pain was. On release from the hospital, they left me with a prescription for Oxycodone, listed as ""Oxycodone HCL 10mg Tab KVK-Tech"". I am to take these once every 6 hours at my own discretion. Since being discharged last Thursday (9/27), I have already used 6 up to today (10/3) - once a day, basically. I have 4 left.

&#x200B;

Basically, I'm worried about becoming addicted or dependent on Oxy. The doctors have told me that 10mg is a low dose and I should not worry about addiction, but I just want to check with experienced users to make sure. I've been experiencing a runny nose a lot of the time, which I know is a withdrawal symptom - especially since I haven't had a runny nose for years prior. Is this dose a danger for me (I know 10mg is tiny compared to what many others do), or should I just continue taking it as needed? Is it possible I'm technically addicted already, or am I just being paranoid?",1538615311.0

This is probably the wrong community, but the one I feel most connected to as an opiate user myself. 

If given a sample and description of expected contents, I could in most cases reasonably discern the most likely pathway of synth and thus the most likely containments, as well as cuts if I had reference standards. 

I am employed at a company and these could not work together, but with small startup cost (relative, I suppose) I could set up a small analysis facility. It would probably cost a few hundred thousand dollars for space, equipment, reagents and compliance/licensing. 

Is this of interest to the community? My aim would be to reduce the cost of getting high performance analysis from hundreds of dollars per sample to $10-30. If set up correctly as a non profit and maybe even with some outside funding, this could be doable given the cheap cost of running (solvents are cheap, the big stuff is the machines and the reference samples). Let me know any feedback

I've been pretty good about taking my daily buprenorphine but I've been getting a hankering for some heroin. Issue is, I've been out of active addiction for such a long time that I actually don't mind being alive so much these days, so was hoping someone could fill me in on how likely it is that any heroin I buy will have fentanyl in it. 

I saw a poster about fentanyl at my local CGL (which is something like a methadone clinic but for all substances), warning about the dangers, so I'm guessing it's definitely a thing here, and if that's the case I'll probably just stay away from heroin entirely. But I don't know maybe it's not as big of a problem here?

Don't get me wrong I'm not saying I'm 100% gonna order some heroin off the darknet, I'm asking as much out of curiosity than any intent to use. My tolerance is so low that some codeine is enough for me these days, I just took just under 200mg and I'm feeling pretty good. Not nodding out, but nice, y'know, so heroin would probably be a bit much. Cheap tho.

Oftentimes it didn't even seem like they cared for opiates that much, it was more like a taboo being broken or something like that.

&#x200B;

Oftentimes the so called ""normies"" who would tell tales were just as ridiculous in another direction, who the hell is still assblasted twenty years later that their kid stole a bottle of RXed cough syrup?!

edit Lately I have found myself even not being so hot on the idea of seeking for bigger doses or new varieties as I used to be, I just think ugh if you try to nod you're just gonna feel like shit the next week etc etc. I'll still fuck you if you bring me  dipipanone or ketobemidone though, even if you're a fat hairy dude.",1538545686.0
9kyf05,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9kyf05/kratom_questions/,20,https://redd.it/9kyf05,phobod3,Kratom questions,"Good evening brothers and sisters, 

I have a question regarding kratom use as a mode for getting clean. Through my research i have found that there are quite a few strains if kratom that each come with different effects and are used for different things. My question is, which strain of kratom is best for getting off heroin dependence and why is that strain the best. Which strain contains the most opiate alkaloids? And finally, what is the best dosage for that strain in order to curb withdrawals entirely in an individual with a high tolerance (using a bun of decent- strong H per day for 3 years and previously 5-10 oxycodone 30s for 8 years, 1 year overlap using blues and h together then strictly H alone). Thank you so much to anyone who answers, i appreciate your help very much. I have subs but i can't begin to list all the reasons i hate using them and i really really want to use kratom instead so please refrain from telling me to use subs because I'll dismiss it from the start, I'm strictly here for kratom advice, nothing more nothing less. Thank you so much again, in advance. God bless you all and i wish health and happiness to you all, members of the best subreddit going.

Ok so I woke up with a horrible hangover and went to my purse to mix up my morning shot. I’ve had cotton fever before and normally it takes a second to kick in, before the needle was out of my arm I felt myself starting to vomit. (TLDR, not a cotton shot, used a fresh q-tip to mix up, clean rig, etc🙄)

I ran to the bathroom and started projectile vomiting all over everything. My whole body felt hot and I started sweating uncontrollably. I threw up until there was nothing left and bile started coming up. I tried to lay down but couldn’t sleep, my body kept alternating between horrible sweats and chills. 

I got up to throw up again and decided to mix up another shot. I was shaking and sweating so badly that every time I got a register I fell out of the vein. I kept trying over and over again, finally got my hands steady and dry enough to push in the shot. 

I went to lay down in my room, brought a bucket because I was still throwing up. It didn’t help right away, but eventually the shot got me to the point where I could just fall asleep. I felt better after sleeping for a few hours.

but TODAY:  it finally happened.  not once, not twice, but **three** times.

**first:**  some homeless guy sat down at the bus stop with me and just started talking about his heroin use out of nowhere, unprovoked.  nice guy, though.

**second:** some guy in the city park was actually advertising.  which like never happens here.  he hit me with a ""got clear and black"" as I was walking past.

**and third:** some guy I saw outside the needle exchange this morning ran into me at the train station, like 8 hours later on the other side of town, and chatted me up for a cigarette and offered to help me score.

like what the fuck?  nothing nothing and nothing for five months and then out of the blue it's like a triple whammy in one day.  like is this a sign that it's my time again?  why today?  I really don't know.  just wanted to talk about it.  I'm conflicted because I've been wanting to get high again really bad, but I also let all three opportunities go.

I've been subscribed to this sub for a little while, and I was doing dope when I first started lurking on here. I was doing opiates for 10 years before I did that shit. The pills weren't doing it for me anymore, plus dope was cheaper, blah blah blah same old story.

Anyway, I went in the hospital after being on it for almost 2 years, detoxed and got on some anxiety medication, then came home and relapsed. Went back in the hospital, got my meds changed up, and now I'm home again. I'm done with the withdrawals, feeling pretty decent, just still having some cravings. But I'm trying my best to resist because that shit was destroying my life and I want to rebuild and recover.

One of my problems is that I'm only about 2 weeks sober and I'm scared of relapsing. I know it's totally my choice and all, but it's just scary to think about going back to that. I'm about to get into a Suboxone clinic, but the issue with that is that they won't take a patient unless they have opiates in their system, so I'm worried about what to do.

I have to take some kind of opiate to get into the clinic, but I don't want to take anything. Would it count as a relapse to take something one time just to get into the clinic?? I'm really trying here, I'm just stuck in a hard spot. Any advice guys? Thanks for reading.",1538526483.0

I didn't ""start"" with anything else because my initial ambition was to end my life (I figured ODing was the best way to go). I bought 10 bags off the original Silk Road and got them in the mail (strangely, the guy I got them from was later part of the case built against the guy who ran the site). I snorted half a bag before I decided to ""pull the trigger"" and within 5 minutes knew that life wasn't \*nearly\* as bad as I thought and I wouldn't have to die (so I guess I have heroin to thank for saving my life).

But later I combined all the bags thinking I would make up some big solution that I could take bits from, I accidentally took too much MDMA (also from SR) and needed to ""calm down"". I was extremely spun out on MDMA so I took probably 6-7 bags worth of heroin and ""shot up"" (I had 0 experience shooting up at this time, so I probably didn't even hit a vein). Still, the only thing that happened was I puked a lot. I didn't pass out or anything.

Since then, I have never overdosed or come even close despite intentionally trying several times since, using dope that someone else ODed on, quitting and then coming back, etc. I live in California and soon after the silk road I started copping it off the streets of SF and SD, so with the exception of the stuff I got off the silk road, everything is tar if that makes a difference.

&#x200B;

I've read since then that almost everyone who ODs is actually taking Xanax or Alcohol along with their heroin but it seems like plenty of people OD ""normally"".  For those who have ODed - will I be able to feel it coming or will I just pass out immediately? Has anyone else been ""congenitally"" incapable of ODing?

No that isn't the lighting btw it is definitely bright purple. 

So neither of my plugs were responding today. Most likely because it's a blizzard up here in Canada currently. But I didn't feel like taking my usual daily dose of methadone and just wanted some opiate buzz whether it was heroin or fent. 

Proceeded to go downtown and walked by the homeless shelter because there is a bridge and under the overpass sometimes guys hang out to get picked up for construction job for cash jobs. But also corner boys hang out occasionally though in my city there isnt much of an open air market anywhere at all. Asked a few people and there was weed, benzo presses, crack and coke but no down ( I usually find down can be the hardest to find and acquire). 

Next I went by city hall because people sometimes deal around there but also only tek/meth. This is where I remembered I have been to the safe injection site once or twice before. So I headed over there and there was a group of people sitting down on the stairs at the church or like community center across from it that looked sort of rough. 

I asked the first girl I saw that looked probably the roughest out of the guys and girls in the group. Immediately ahead said she had some but I would have to trust her to go around the corner with a plug that was on the other side of the street. At this point I was obviously a little hesitant because I never let the money walk with anyone or trust anyone in this kind of circumstance on the street because I have been burnt for a few hundred a couple times for doing this. So I just said to her hey I will trust you but I'm only going to do 50 dollars not the 100 I originally stated which she was cool with and understood. I also gave her 60 throwing her 10$ because I could tell she had a rough life on the streets and probabaly needed it alot more then me and was helping me out. Also I could afford to get burned for 60$ if it happened. I also threw her a hoot to have on some foil as a measure of appreciation since she got it instantly and it was a fat couple bags. Was definitely the barney the dinosaur purple fent that is going around but thankfully for fent this stuff actually has reasonably long legs and doesnt only last an hour or two which is what makes fent so unappealing.",1538520037.0

I don't think they take the time to empty the capsules so the flakes are probably pieces of the capsule in TINY form because they put it in a coffee grinder.  It's not much but if you look closely its definitely there.  It is pretty consistent which I like, almost the same thing every time or close, but its also the only opiate I can get and it's take a fucking taking a toll on my nasal cavities!!

&#x200B;

The problem is because the bags are huge and I've grown a tolerance, 4-5 bags is equal to like 10 thirties in powder probably, and that's what I am at now (at first I was only doing 2 bags a day).  I try as hard as I can to do without nasal spray, so my nose is ALWAYS clogged and I can barely sniff it up my nose, its a mess and its annoying but its life as an addict I guess.   Up until a week ago my nose would be able to be blown out completely to the point where the mornings were the best sniff bc it went right up and by night it would be fully clogged but now its always clogged.  From the second week and on, there's been various nights with blowing out blood.  Since a few days ago it is now not clearing up enough to snort easily in the morning, and my nose is basically clogged the entire day.  I shined my phone light up there today for the first time and it is all scabbed and yellow and weird looking, I hope its not infected.  One side is worse than the other but both sides are fucked up.  Needless to say I am still trying to get it up there because I have bags left.  This shit DEF cant be smoked and I don't shoot so that out of the question, so are there any other ways to take it?

 I guess this is a shitpost but man it feels sooo fantastic got a G of some fire #3 for 30€. This dope got for sure about 60-80% purity. Great to have a new plug after I deleted all old numbers. I will just chip today and tomorrow cause tomorrow is my free day and I just wanted to be high. Man its so great to feel this feelings again. I feel like I could do anything that I want. In my country is winter now and its freezing cold but with dope its not as cold as without. I know that I will not use for more than 3 days in a row but I also got 3.5gs of some pure afghan incoming from the DNMs and I used that stuff before you just snort about .1 and then I nearly nod the fuck out for about 2 hours straight. I hope this time chipping will work better and that the 3.5gs will last for this month cause my car is broken and I need to pay a few grands for it to get fixed. I was clean for a month now but I only could barely sleep in thr night and today and tomorrow I know that I will sleep like in gods bed. Normally I would go and get on mdone or subs but here in germany you will lose your drivers license if you are on maintenance. So I cant cause I need my license to get to work to pay my bills. Amd also to have a opi adventure every few month or weeks. God knows how long I will live but I know that I will ever come back to heroin untill I get a kid. Cause if I ever will have kids amd I want to I will be sober. Just to be at least the half like my dad, he was such a good father. Sadly I never told him before he died. But we didnt had to talk about such things. We both knew it. I remember one of the best 3 years when he drove me 3 times a week to my training and we talked all the time. He watched me playing standing there proudly saying things like: "" Look this guy is my son!"" I sadly never had the chance to tell him my feelings cause I woke up to my mom screaming that my dad is dead in their sleeping room. I tried to revive him but it didnt work. I gave all I can and much more. I was willing to sell my sould to the devil just that he could live. But thats live and I learned to live my life with PTSD and mental problems like depression etc. and I know everytime he looks down to me he says:""Look thats my son! I am so proud of him. Even if he makes mistakes like doing dope for 2 years straight. But he has such abgreat soul and is so lovely amd trys to help everyone!"" And I am just the one I am because of him raising me like he did. He said that there will be assholes on this world and it may look like their life is better but never be one of them. Life will throw many rocks at you even ones that may kill you but you have to fight like he did amd then he said that if you will be a good person you will get a reward of it for me its my two wonderful sons and my wonderful life. I know I drifted a bit away and this post may have no real point but I learned today again if you keep fighting then you will get a reward of it. My depression got so much easier for me in the last 4 months since I am sober ( I just used for one week after 3 months and then decided on my own that I need help again and got clean again with the help of my doctor) I can laugh again and I am much more happier with me and my life. I just wanted to say while I am high and yes I know this is double moral but if you ever need help or just someone to talk to who knows what a loss of a family member or friend feels like then you can PM me everytime of the day. It may take a bit untill I answer since most of you guys are in another time zone but I will answer and try to help you. Stay safe fam.

(IV safer use),"Hey guys, I was sick and finally got home with dope (and a lil soft) in my pocket. I couldn't wait to get high so I prepped the shot and strapped the tourniquet as usual. I register quickly in a small vein down the side of my ring finger, and I know I'm supposed to take the tourney off NOW . But the vein was so small and shy, and I feared it would disappear upon loosing the tourney, plus I would have had to let go of the syringe; which is very hard because you have to hold the syringe in a certain angle


So I shot up. No pain or anything, the rush was diminished but came in full force when the tourney was off. My finger vein looks ok if slightly bloated, I think that if I keep rotating and give that finger a rest for a while, it'll be available sooner rather than later


Sorry for the blog post, my question is essentially: How  dangerous is it to shoot up before undoing the tourniquet? I got a slightly swollen vein and a histamine reaction (which is par for the course). Do you always take the tourniquet off first and if so, how do you undo it? I have a medical tourney which has a plastic lock. Biting doesn't really work tho...

I now have a case with CPS because my daughter was in the house asleep at the time. My wife is traumatized. My life has been turned upside down, but I am alive.

I am going to try my best to take this as a wake up call and go the sober route.

God bless the TGA. There is a push by certain “doctors groups” to ban a certain popular, OTC cough syrup that contains a certain opioid..

Before we all rush out and clear the shelves, it’s not Dihydrocodeine! 

Despite pushing for the ban on codeine, they’ve stubbornly refused to upschedule our beloved Rikodeine. 

Apparently there’s a push to ban pholcodine (an antitussive found in many OTC preparations) due to it causing a reaction with some of the muscle relaxants used during anaesthesia. 

There have apparently been some deaths on the table and serious adverse effects during surgery due to this interaction. 

I plan on having a chat with the father in law over the weekend to get his thoughts, (he’s an anaesthetist) & see if it’s overblown or a legit concern. 

But yeah, if you’re going in for surgery, don’t take pholcodine apparently is the takeaway. 

I don’t know why you would, it’s basically shit for a high, but ya know, harm reduction and all that. 

Not sure if anyone cares, but I thought I’d mention it. 

Let’s just keep the DHC abuse on the down low and not be obnoxious dicks about it, lest it come to the attention of the fun police we overgoverned peasants call the TGA or some activist politician (or worse) doctor.

I’ve been off and on opiates for about 5 years now. Used for 2 years nonstop. This last run was 6 months. First tried opiates when I was 15-16. 

Right now I can’t bring myself to do anything, even with kratom. Work is an absolute chore now and I used to enjoy it thoroughly, and I can’t even bring myself to play video games while at home. All I do is browse Reddit, watch YouTube and smoke cigarettes. I’m incredibly depressed, and everyday the urge to go back to dope is getting harder to fight off. Sure it won’t cure my depression, I know that. But at least I’ll be productive. At least I’ll be content for most of my day.

Anyway. I really feel like maintenance might be an option for me. I’ve used methadone and suboxone a few times in the past, never prescribed. I liked them. I’m only 25 and I just didn’t know if I’d want to be on them for the rest of my life. (I feel like I will, I feel like my brain is wired for opiates) 

What I’m worried about is never being able to get a painkiller prescription ever again if I do get on maintenance.  Also anyone that’s been on subs or methadone, what are the long term effects of maintenance? I’ve heard shitty things. Also SSRI’s are completely out of the question. Already been there.

This dude got arrested with serious weight last spring, among the many other charges they throw on you(intent to sell, weapons, prescription without prescrition blah blah) Was sure he was in prison but apparently hes out and still slanging. Dude literally lives a quarter mile away from me, had some dope within 10 mins of texting him. He charges a lot(small town far away from any major cities) but that's expected and the quality is on point. Now Im sitting here smoking some tar and I'm fucking hyped. And to make it even better, right after I scored, my mom messaged me telling me a government check(that i didnt think i would get) just arrived for me with just under 2k. 

Now here's hoping to me chipping for the next few months and not falling too hard down the rabbit hole. I actually think my dealer being expensive is actually pretty good because I'm a cheapskate so I hopefully won't be buying too much/building too big of a habit. Happy nods guys!

 I've saved 4 people's life who surely would have died. Two have 2 kids, one has 3 kids and 2 more adopted from Rwanda and the Crimea.  The last has 4 kids.

The incidents that were overdoses likely won't happen again as they've been clean 9 years thru 2 kids.

All have families. None of us do anything spectacular or special in terms of careers. I resent the business world and get backstabbed by the person I just busted my ass to help them not get stabbed.

The survivors I helped work middle class jobs kids don't shout about during career day.

I probably won't have kids, even though I'd love to. I'll die poor. Probably leaving more in my will than ever had in life.

I've been blessed. I've been lucky. I am a junkie. I cry every few days from the sickness and despair.  Only a dream job seems the answer, except everyone who is lucky enough to,get,theirs, realizes that wasn't the answer either.

So ill keep getting hi selfishly.  I don't see a reason not to. Society will still suck balls for all my years of trying to change it. So I'll keep remembering I've done something positive and worthy while here.  Ill ignore the mass of voices screaming it wasn't enough, you didn't make enough money.  You spent too much time enjoying life while money and power got away.

I’ve been using Kratom everyday for over a year and never have I once almost died from it. It has a similar safety profile to marijuana in my opinion and Kratom is extremely beneficial in my everyday life in multiple ways. Drs are now afraid to prescribe opioids to people who need them and they turn to heroin that can be potentially laced with Fentanyl. Most opioid related deaths are from a combination of CNS depressants and ignorance. Why should the responsible drug users be punished? I’m pissed off at this whole situation. ,1538431353.0
9kksn4,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9kksn4/dumped_by_my_pain_doc/,22,https://redd.it/9kksn4,msboobybuyer,Dumped by my pain doc,"So technically they didn't completely dump me, they just cut my dose in half and told me I had to see another doctor at another location that I can't get to via bus.  I got my gp to give me a final script of 10 mg Percocet 3x/day to get me through figuring something else out.

I tried many times previously to get my pain management doc to either put me on methadone or suboxone but they refused (I have serious memory problems and taking something thrice a day is completely unmanageable for me).

So my shrink is a suboxone prescriber and I have an appointment there tomorrow.  I've been searching this sub and Google but I'm not finding any real ideas as to how long I'm going to have to be withdrawing before I can actually take a sub.  I've been on essentially the same dose for 15 years and have no idea how long it takes me to go into withdrawals (that memory thing again - sometimes I don't even realize I'm withdrawing because I honestly can't tell the difference between that and a regular shitty day).

Is there a rule of thumb for the number of hours between your last dose of oxy and first of suboxone? I'm sure they'll explain everything to me at my appointment but I'd also like to know from others experience rather than *just* the clinical side.

I also have heard subs are far worse to get off of than the Percocet itself.  Is this true?

As a side note, fuck the government for making chronic pain patients go through this shit.  If something other than opiates worked for me, I'd be on it.  It's fucking ridiculous.

Thanks!

Edit:

Had my appointment.  I'm already an established psychiatric patient of his so I knew he was great going in.  Got the subs no problem and he had some choice words about my pain management clinic. 

Unfortunately, unlike my pain management clinic, I can't make use of my ridiculously expensive medical marijuana card anymore.  I'm a bit disappointed about that but I guess it is what it is.  The dispensaries here are outrageously expensive so I haven't been in a month anyway so I guess It's whatever but I'll miss having the option.

He gave me a script for ten days to start.  I looked at the next appointment card the receptionist gave me is for 14.  Luckily I've got a bunch of Percocet left anyway so I'm not worried.

 I said hey you don't know anyone who sells heroin? 
He thought about it and said no  :(
 I went and bought another steak bake for myself and passed him again and he called me over. 
""your not police are you"" 
I laugh and say no and followed with I'll make it worth your time. He said how much you needing. I say I'll probaly get..5 to a g. He says get me half a G? I agree and say meet me in the car park and I head off as he packs his sleeping bag up. To my surprise he says a g here is 50 but in the city its 30 quite cheap. I go get cash and we pull up to the local guy but he's not in so we head off to the city. We chat on the drive he's a rally nice guy just had some shit happen.

We stop at a pharmacy and he picks up some pins and we head to the dealer. He leaves his bag in the car and heads in about 10 mins laters he's back with 3g 2 for me 1 for him and I let him keep the change.  We head to a place so he can shoot. He's not got much veins left so he shoots In his groin and I smoke some on foil. He comes back In the car and pretty much passes out thought he was gonna od but he came too 5 mins later. Getting conversation out of him was hard on the way back but we shake hands he let's me know where he usualy begs and we part ways.

He didn't short me. He didn't run away with money he was a real nice guy. His phone was broken so I said pop into my shop sometime I'll see if I can fix that for you and I said I'll see you around.

My situation - I'm lucky enough that I work from home, but my job is still very demanding (9am - 7pm every day).

My habit - Relapsed 2 months ago and quickly ran up to doing 210mg/day of oxy.

&#x200B;

Last time I quit cold turkey off 150mg/day, it was absolute hell for 6 days. Couldn't work at all. I'd like to avoid that.

&#x200B;

Yesterday, I drastically dropped my does to 90mg (taken all at once in the morning).

This got me through work. I didn't start feeling WDs till around 8pm last night. I took 5g of kratom and went to bed.

I'm going to do the same today.

&#x200B;

My plan:

&#x200B;

Days 1-3 - 90mg in the morning / Kratom at night

Days 4-6 - 75mg in the morning / Kratom at night

Days 7-9 - 60mg in the morning / Kratom at night

Days 10 - 12 - 45mg in the morning / Kratom at night

Days 13 - 15 - 30mg in the morning / Kratom at night

Days 16 - 18 - 15mg in the morning / Kratom at night

Days 19 - 21 - 7.5m in the morning / Kratom at night

Days 22 - 30 - 10g Kratom in the morning / Kratom at night

Anyways lots of pain.
Florida laws now say doctors can only prescribe 3 or 7 day supplies of any opiate pain killers I don't think the law applies to terminal ill I didn't think it applied to post op either..
But when I left the hospital they only gave me a 3 day supply of 10mg oxy..
They kept asking me in the hospital if the medicine was working I kept telling them no.. They said they would adjust my meds.. I thought they would up it to 15mg.. Instead they just gave me 10mg and told me to take 2 every six hours. Smh. And I guess hospitals are only allowed to give 3 day supplies
.i had my first rehab session yesterday and the therapist was like that's all the medicine they gave you what the hell that was a major surgery..
He actually left a message with the doctor today about it.. I left a message too and they havent called back... It's fucked I'm hurting bad.. And only have 4 left..

So this is just a warning to anyone in Florida that is thinking of going to a doctor and trying to score or whatever..
I have abused shit on the past...
Amd was on a very vee low dose of sub before I got hurt.. So thebu first day those morphine injections they gave me a lost did nothing..

I spent the first night with a friend smoking weed to help me be somewhat comfortable. Had some really intense thoughts about life in general and had no intention to use the next day. I was recognizing opiate withdrawal symptoms and telling myself. This is all I have to do is just endure the yawns, shaking , and feeling hot and cold. This is easy I can do this, I'm doing this! Then I just went into autopilot picked up and shot up about a gram throughout the night. I'm waking up hating myself right now and what a failure I am for not using this weekend off work to use to my advantage. I've been trying every weekend the past two months to attempt quitting. I'll make it a day or so usually but this time 40 hours was my longest time without before giving in. I work tomorrow morning.

Will I be ok if I wait 24 hours and take a Subutex at work tomorrow? I have 4 Subutex pills. Will that get me through the week, able to function at my physical job, and then go through the Subutex withdrawal next weekend?

I have been spending a lot of time thinking about way that legalization would help society, unfortunately I have hit a roadblock in my thinking. a few months ago while my weed dealer was out of town I made the stupid decision to try a synthetic cannabinoid sold at a local corner store. Although it is not the same as heroin addiction it did grab a hold of me and cause some pretty big waves through my family, I have since stopped and have been off of it for 3 weeks now.  Anyway it really changed my perspective on legalising and controlling all substances. 

&#x200B;

I believe people have a right to do drugs

I believe people have a right to pure, and clean substances

I Imagine a world where access to drugs and drug rehab programs are equal 

I imagine strict penalties for sale to minors

&#x200B;

I have come up with many ideas on how this whole thing could work out in a very socially responsible way, but because of my recent dabbling in  ""addiction"" I feel this is not something I have any say in, just like seeing a bunch of men advocating against abortion, I really have no say.

&#x200B;

how do anny current or recovering addicts feel about this

If you have any questions about how I imagine regulation would work please ask, I love discussing my ideas but there are alot of them and im not going to wright out an entire bill if nobody wants to hear it. 

&#x200B;

The war on substances that are addictive is important, unfortunately it is not working.. and in an ideal world these drugs would not be accessible at all, but that will never happen. but does that mean we should stop fighting it???

I rolled over and smoked a cig layin in bed, then took a few hits of some fire buds out of my bowl, and then a few fat dabs from my portable vape while I took a shit.
Once I was fired up, stoned, and cleared of the drugs I ate for dinner last night, I blew half of a 30mg oxycontin.
The day went on, I smoked about an eighth of marijuana over the course of 2 hours (4-6pm), and I preceeded to meet up with a few friends.
By 8pm I was outta my house and met up with a couple buddies at another friends crib, where one of my friends had 4 more 30mg oxys with my name on them.
I immedietly split one in half and swallowed it, and the other half was ground up and insufflated.
The next oxy I attempted to break in half also... but it broke messily into multiple pieces!!
I took one of the larger pill chunks and freebased it off some tinfoil I reused through the night. The rest of that pill snorted.
Next oxy was broken in half perfectly, and so  one half was ground up while I swallowed the other, then I waited.
It was about 12am when my buddy grabbed a gram or so of some 'white girl' he had lyin around and so I had to mix some with my oxy and of course I freebased it..
Another 20 mins after that one of my other buddies pulls out some 10mg adderalls.. so we all blew one of those before finishing off the white.

So, where to start..! I (26F) have been on opiates (oxycodone/contin) for like 5-6 years. Started off really small, got really big, now at like medium use- compared to before. I spent the last year or so very slowly tapering from my high of 330mg/day to now about 80mg/day. At this point is just maintenance to be able to function properly in my everyday life w out being sick or too tired. SO, I’ve been in this great relationship for a while with this great person and just found out this weekend that I’m about 4 weeks pregnant. My first glaring thought is I need to get off opiates like yesterday. I’ve read so many different plans for tapering down that it gets overwhelming, and bc I’ve tapered very slowly over the last year I was hoping someone could give insight on the FASTEST way to taper off right this minute while still being able to function. There’s no way I’m continuing this habit while pregnant and turning into a fucked up statistic. My bf and I both have really good jobs, just bought a  big house, have great pets, he has a great family, and  yada yada so on and so forth, and I just want to eliminate this secret dark cloud that follows me around. I’ve been wanting to quit all together for quite some time now, and this just puts the fire under me more to get it totally gone and out of my system forever and ever.

Ran out of dope and the sickness was coming on... took 3 scoops of kratom and a Valium and could just muster the strength to leave the house...

I try signing up at a methadone clinic but am informed the process takes weeks. So I head out in search of homeless people...

I pass by a few people drinking beers in the AM outside a pharmacy-- and recognizing those pinned pupils, straight up asked them if they knew where to score 

The dude I first approached directed me to this LOVELY woman across the road who I offered to buy a bag in return for pointing me in the right direction. She says she isn't greedy, and calls up her connect and tells me I can get 3 for 20-- telling me in her junky days the third bag wouldn't have been mentioned on the sly, but she's on methadone and recovering. 

Within 10 mins of meeting this woman I had her number, 3 points for 20 and met the connect and got his number too

Couldn't have gone smoother or have occurred at a better time -- and I've never cold copped in my life. The product is QUALITY afghan

They even told me never to approach certain people or avoid certain areas because the middles there would rob me in a heartbeat

It's so sad that some of the nicest souls are the ones that go down this path-- this woman just wanted to help me out for nothing in return, because she felt sympathy seeing me rattling.

The only reason USA users have such easy access to subs is due to greedy amoral corporations who literally changed very long standing law by pushing the DATA act of 2000.

It was greed, not sympathy or love for addicts that broke down one element of prohibition. It was greed that got the beloved oxycodone RXed for every damn thing for a decade. Your hook up or Dboy ain't slanging because he loves spreading nods in the world, he is doing it for greed.

&#x200B;

If we wanna fight drug prohibition we need to show what a lucrative field it is for profit, not wanting pity and sympathy.

- pot
- 3 1 quart mason jars
- Coffee filters
- Blender
- Dehydrator 
- Spoons
- cheese cloth

Once the poppies have matured and spread their seed they are ready to be used. They should be drying out and turning brown by this point and I pull them and put them in my dehydrator at 30C(86F) for 1-2 days to ensure they are fully dry  I include the roots, stems, leaves and pods basically the whole plant.

This is why I don’t just score the pods and scrape the opium in this process you get all of it from the whole plant, giving a way higher yield. Once all the poppies are dry throw them in a blender ( I used a magic bullet small amounts at a time) shred it till it’s fine and mostly powder, but it kind of rips apart stringy so it won’t be fully powder. 

Throw all the poppy grounds in a big pot and cover enough water to have it all floating like a inch above the bottom and stir it till it’s a saturated.  Turn the stove up to medium and bring to a simmer ( now here’s where the cook starts be prepared to focus and work)

Keep the pot simmering and stirring constantly for 4 hours no less i would stir every 2-3 minutes and add water every now and then to keep the water level good or else the poppy will start to burn and ruin you’re opium. Once the 4 hours is up strain the mixture through a fine mesh into a mason jar and cap it make sure to squeeze out all the juice trying to get everything out. Cheese cloth will work for this coffeee filters get jammed to easy at this point. 

Put all the poppy ground back into the pot fill with water and do a second pull but this time only do for 2 hours, squeeze out as much juice as you can from ur poppy grounds then throw it out. You should now have a jar full of dark brown opaque water  
Filter it through a coffee filter again into another mason jar I recommend doing it in a funnel because it makes it way easier. It should be very slow filtering and stirring constantly and replacing the filter every now and again helps it not get clogged.

Filter it one final time into the last mason jar then pour all of the water into a clean pot and simmer the pot down until there’s not a lot of water in the pot be very careful not to evaporate to much or it burns, sticks to your pan and ruins it.  It should be very thick dark brown liquid now at this point  pour it all into a glass dish and scrape out as much opium as you can from the pot the more you leave the lower you’re yield will be.

Put the glass tray in you’re dehyator or have a fan blow on it for 1 day and it will be mostly dark brown opium at this point if it’s still to stick to touch then let it keep drying. Once it’s dryer form it into a ball and let air dry for another day, it should now be black and look like bth this is you’re opium.

Refining the opium further:

You can dissolve the opium in a small pot of water and boil it for 20 mins then filter again and evaporate it down again and re dry this and it will then be great for smoking.",1538365342.0

IV’ed myself, that is. I’ve always got my best friend to do it, was too scared to do it myself. I’m not a daily user, I was heavily addicted to OxyContin (the old CDN formula) and Fentanyl patches from 2007-2012. I got clean in 2012 and was clean for 5 years (!) before I had a month long relapse. I’ve been mostly clean since November of 2017 and have used maybe a handful of times while I’m on sub maintenance. 
I found Hydromorph-Contin last year and fell in total and complete love with it. Maybe bc it had been so long since I had used anything, but the first time I snorted it I couldn’t believe the feeling. I loved it, and continued snorting it until I got busted by my mother and got kicked out of my apartment by my best friend because she was “worried” about me. So now I live at home again and it fucking SUCKS trying to sneak around and use once in awhile.
My other friend, not the one I lived with, was into Hydromorph HEAVY and was shooting it multiple times daily, and I had never IV’ed before but I wanted to feel that amazing rush again-and I wanted to see what all the fuss is about in regards to IV’ing Hydromorphone was. He begged and begged me to not do it, he refused to use a needle on me until one day when I knew he was sick and desperate. I bought us the pills and told him he had to IV me, and he finally agreed. 
Oh. My. Fucking. God. We had Narcan on standby, and he was super diligent about sterility and made me use alcohol wipes and a hot compress and all that jazz. I was literally in heaven for 4 minutes, I never knew it could feel that way. I get it now. I understand why people say to never start using needles, it just feels too good. We did it maybe four more times, and I just couldn’t believe how amazing it was. But he left, moved 8 hours away to get clean and restart his life. I’m happy he’s getting better. In all my years in this life, I’ve never met a sicker addict. 
So the point of this? Last night, after two weeks of not using anything, I used a needle and shot myself up. I had obtained a 24mg Hydromorph-Contin and prepped it according to all the things I’ve read, seen, and heard. I was nervous, but not really. For some reason I felt a sense of calm and control. I didn’t tie off, I put the needle in my left hand and pulled back-omg I’m in! I continued, but was too scared to do the full dose so I stopped. Holy shit, I can’t believe after all these years of opiate addiction and recovery, I used a needle on myself and it worked! 
Now that I’ve done it, I have to step away for awhile. I instantly wanted more after that initial amazing rush wore off. And that’s not a good thing. I really didn’t think I’d be able to hit. I’m happy I experienced that feeling, it was like a sense of peace washing over me, and I don’t feel peaceful too often. 
Sorry about the long-winded babbling in this post, I’ve been lurking here for quite awhile and have commented but never posted. I have no one to confess my exploits to so I figured I’d get it out here, one of my favourite places on the Internet with people I identify with. You guys are all awesome. So thanks for reading if anyone did.

I wanted to started a dedicated thread about this topic.

I am an occasional opiate user and have been for about the past 20 years. My use has always been sparse and I've never developed a habit. I used to snort h a bit in the early 2000s before the fent came along. Later on I've had some medical procedures. Since I have a high pain threshold I'd usually just hold onto pills for later recreational use.

I want to get a opiate high again. What's stopping me is reading about fent. I've read stories of ODs from snorting a single bag, which was inconceivable 15 years ago. The same with pressies. I had a friend recently OD (he survived) from eating what he presumed was a pain pill.

So I wanted to get a small amount of h and smoke it from foil. If I did it, I might be able to get it from a safer source, though of course we never know.

Simply put, is it safe to inhale a hit of h? Thanks.

Then I decided to extract one and IV it. Well must have done the extraction very well and you do not absorb all the fentanyl bucally. Or it slowly absorbs bucally, compared to that IV all in in the second. Or the buccal bioavailability is lower than what wiki says. W/E

So, i extracted this fent patch for IV use. (DO NOT ASK ME HOW TO DO IT, I COULD VERY EASILY GET PROSECUTED IF YOU DIE SO I WILL NOT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION). 1 (yes, one) patch. IVed it all.

Beth’s car runs a few spots over from right in front of my door.

The wipers move lazily. Water droplets bead the window and slide down the exterior of the car. Exhaust blows out the tailpipe. Beth and Sal are screaming so loudly it can be heard through the rolled-up windows which makes me not want to get in, but it’s the only way to move up in the game. 

I go back into my room and get on my belly to reach under the bed and grab that dirty piece of steel under there. Again, it is cold against my stomach and heavy in my waistband. The gun makes me miserable, just having it, and as I turn to lock the door on the way out, the neighbor lady’s door is opened. She still wears the black garbage bag for a skirt but this time with no top. From the dark insides of her room, she asks me to tell Hank that she loves him and cries on her bed.

“Okay. Sure.” I shout and move towards the running vehicle. 

The screaming has stopped, but it’s obvious things aren’t going well. I get in the back seat. Beth wears gold hoop earrings. She bites her lip and puts it in reverse. Sal is looking straight ahead. He folds his arms and hasn’t said anything for several minutes while she sways her head every time she shifts in the old Civic. She’s being dramatic. No words are spoken until we get outside of some shops with apartment buildings up top in Chinatown. We’re just a few blocks from the Pinball museum. I know where it is, because it’s one of the first things I was ever invited to do after I got sober, but just like that Mariner’s game the kid invited me to the other night, I never went, but I did walk by it almost every day to and from work when I was a valet. 

Anyway, Sal has his hands in his hoodie belly pocket. He looks at me. His eyes are lucid. Beth wears a brown leather jacket with all kinds of buckles and tighter jeans than normal. She clutches her bag behind us and steps with an angry, chemically induced swish. Her heels clack on the pavement. She’s wearing sunglasses.  

“Guess, it ain’t all Chinese in Chinatown, huh?” I say.

“Guess not.” Sal says.

Beth is quiet as Sal presses the button up to whatever apartment his man is in and we wait. Rain drops fall. It’s chilly outside. The door buzzes, and we walk up two flights of stairs to a bare concrete hallway. Asian music plays through the wall. The singer sounds lovesick, and the strange smells of foreign foods waft through the building. Apartments are small up here, and it’s warmer than it is outside. Sal takes us to the last door by the window looking out over the street, and he knocks. Feet move across the floor. The chain unlatches from inside. 

A small woman looks out and beckons us in. Inside there is a small Vietnamese man with a white tank top on with windbreaker pants and a pair of black slippers. He wears a jade Buddah on a gold chain around his neck. There is another gold chain on his wrist. The 30 something year old man sits at the table with a several full-sized sandwich bags holding large pressed pieces of dope. He smiles excitedly and holds his hand out,

“Oh. So, you Sal’s boy, huh?” He tilts his head back, like he’s inspecting me.

“Yeah. This is the Junky Vonnegut.” Sal interrupts.

The man ignores Sal. “My name is Thahn, but you call me Tony. Okay?” His accent is thick.

“Okay, Tony.” I say.

He is beaming, ignoring Sal completely. Beth sits on the couch with her legs crossed. One foot kicks. Her arms are folded. Tony’s woman or whoever she is has gone back into the bedroom. She uses a mirror in her lap and folded cards to deposit small amounts of white powder from a pile into the small wax baggies I’ve been selling. Every so many, she wraps them up in a rubber band. I know the number is 14. 

Tony tries to address me as Vonnegut but says, “Runnyket, I sell for my father. We have much more. We want sell more, now. You sell for us?”

“Yes,” I smile, “I sell for you.”

“Okay. Very good. I have everything you want. No problem.”

“What will you do for 7,500?”

“7,500? You not messing around Runnyket.” 

“It’s what I got, today.” I act cool as if I know what the standard amounts are for that kind of money but am just waiting to see if the deal he’s cutting is any good. 

“7,500?” He pronounces each word with a long, skeptical whine. His voice is low. “7,500 Runnyket?”

“Yes. 7,500.”

“Okay. I give you deal, man.” He sits up and speaks louder. “Half pound. Good deal, man.”

I figure in my head that’s less than 1,000 bucks an ounce. For the quality and price I know one of those little baggies will fetch, this deal will make me rich. Beth stands up and announces that she’s going to the bathroom. Sal sits on a recliner in the dark corner focused on me and Tony talking. He looks at us sideways. He bites his nails. The mechanism on the doorknob clicks as Beth shuts the door behind her. I pull my money out of my pocket to count out five 100-dollar bills which I keep and toss the rest on the table. Tony picks it up and counts it.  

  A minute later, he says, “Okay, Runnyket. Take.” He hands me eight of the sandwich bags on the table, one by one. “Okay?”

“Sure. You have a bag?”

“Yeah. Rose. Get bag for Runnyket!”

The Asian lady who let us in gets up off the bed, sets the mirror down on the mattress and walks into the kitchen. She leans down and opens a door. She hands me one of those reusable fabric grocery bags you can buy at the store for a couple of bucks. I load the ounces into the bag. 

The sink is running in the bathroom. It’s been going for a while, and there’s a loud thud from inside of it that causes the glass in the apartment to vibrate. Something’s wrong. Sounds are funny like that. When they’re serious, you know it. Like when you hear someone’s skull split open on the pavement or the way a person screams in crisis or just the sound of a body falling to the floor in a way that’s serious. You can’t mistake it. You know something’s wrong. Maybe, it isn’t so much the sound itself, but the absence of any sound or movement on either side of the sound that makes it obvious. No sounds of getting up signal my subconscious that it’s not just no big deal. The water’s still running. That’s it.  

Sal jumps up and opens the door. Beth is laid out like a wet dishrag on the floor. She's sweating. Blood runs from her arm and neck. It looks like there’s a gash in her head from the fall. An uncapped needle rolls across the floor. Sal grabs her bag and digs in it.

“COME ON! COME ON! Where is it?” He says frantically. “HERE!” He holds a naloxone nasal sprayer in his hand and leans over her face to administer it. Sal slaps her and props her head up. “Come on! Come on, baby!”

Tony and his woman are staring at the scene with their hands on their waist. Sal finds another plastic nasal sprayer and holds it in case the first one doesn’t work. Tony leans over and asks him,

“She live?”

“I think so.”

“Good, Sal. No more.”

“No more what?” Sal asks. He sounds irritated. 

Rose has walked over with a wet towel in her hands and wrings it out on the overdosed girl’s face. Beth moans. It’s this very dramatic and ungraceful vocalization that is pitiful to watch and hear and makes me realize how much grace Beth has always had. She’s lost it since she stared using so hard, and that is hard to see. A web of spittle hangs between the lips of her open mouth on the floor, and she moans again. There is the unmistakable smell of someone who has defecated on themselves in the apartment.

“No more, Sal. No more business, man. We finish. You go to Runnyket, now. Runnyket sell you.”  ",1538293251.0

Read \[here\]([https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=89777](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=89777)) that if it's NOT generic, then it's safe. I don't know what mine is

Quote:

\>  **two primary forms of an oral morphine solution, the brand-name “Roxanol“, which tends to have flavors and sugars, etc added, and the generic which is made by Roxaine Laboratories.**

\> **The defining difference between the two is what is in the solution. The generic explicitly states ' No sugars, NO Alcohol, No additives.**

\> **If your bottle does not say this, find a new route.**

\>**Injecting the sugars and additives can cause MAJOR problems, as in fatal. Not to say the other is safe, but that's the only one I chose to consume and can report usage with. Also the Roxanol tends to come in white plastic bottles while the Roxaine Labs generic comes in a dark brown glass bottle.**

&#x200B;

My bottle indicates:

\>Blue Solution Clear Raspberry

Other:

Bottle is PLASTIC, not Glass

Brown Colored bottle

Provided by an HMO known for preferring to give out generics.

Things have been going downhill and now that I have finally been informed, (it was kept a secret) I’m terrified for her safety. The last time she overdosed it took 6 Narcans to bring her back. This time they attempted the same, but needed to use an I.V. as well. (As told to me by my family.) From what coworkers are telling me, this is a severe state. Her mother keeps going away to events and parties while leaving her alone at home, while her father works and gets really angry when he is told to stay and watch her. (So he doesn’t) They both refuse to admit her anywhere because of cost. I want to know if there is anything I can do anonymously to help, because people are telling me that she will die. If not I’m fine with stepping in without the anonymity, but I prefer not to. No one, including myself knows anything about Heroin or drug abuse at all. I don’t want to lose my cousin.

Why it even took that long to come to that conclusion, or why it came to me in that peculiar moment, I don't know.  Regardless, I was out of dope and withdrawing, and I badly needed the dopamine burst. I wished I had never gone to New York at all. I wished I had not relapsed. I wished I could shoot up in peace and maybe do too much and never come back. My misery was back like it had never left.

Let’s go back in time a few months. The relapse was not a sudden thing, I had planned and expected it. Around the time I had reached one year of clean time I began using kratom every so often, then weekly, then whenever I felt like it--giving up on the hope of being disciplined about it. Then around 14 months, I had no qualms with helping myself to the my girlfriend’s roommate's pain pills in the bathroom cabinet. I had also began to frequent my online drug forums again to read the stories and relive that life second-hand. I was bored and was missing the exciting part of all of it. So, like a Catholic priest at an all boys prep-school, there was temptation all around me and simply a matter of time before I indulged my hedonistic tendencies.

The apartment I was living in was nothing more than a basement with a mattress. I told my family that I was having a hard time deciding on how to decorate the place. But the real reason for the barren home was that I didn’t care to spend money on furniture and posters that could have otherwise been spent on dope. Any superfluous purchase was dope out of my pocket. So, like any dutiful drug addict I had to take that into consideration every time I spent money. The result was an apartment with a dirty mattress and top ramen.

Closer to my relapse, I had been given the opportunity to visit New York City with my father for the first time. Up until my 20’s I had never been anywhere besides the west coast, except for a brief stint in Colorado. I was accustomed to black tar heroin--the gummy, vinegar smelling substance because it was all I could get where I lived. Ever since I saw Pulp Fiction, I always had this idealized view of East Coast heroin. Heroin in movies was never tar, it was always a light colored powder, I found it sexy. And knew that regardless of my clean time or lack of clean time, I would indulge myself  if given the opportunity.

I jumped at the chance to go to New York with my father. He told me I’d be on my own most of the time since he was going there for work, on a business trip. I would have to explore the city by myself for the most part. I was fine with all this.

I had progressed a great deal over the course of my year or so of clean time. I had a great job with a fantastic company, I was very fit and strong, most likely in the best shape of my life, and was on good terms with my friends and family--as evidenced by my Dad’s invitation to go on this business trip with him.

So, eastward we went. And due to a lucky circumstance, I got upgraded to first class on the way from California to New York. The trip was starting off great. I was super excited to experience the East Coast and was looking forward to all that lay ahead.

We arrived at our hotel in the financial district on Wednesday night. We were staying for four full days and would come back on Sunday. The first day I went out into the city after my Dad left for work and just walked around. I did a little sightseeing and took a few photos. Got some good food from the food carts and had an enjoyable day walking around. For dinner I went to Shake Shack downtown and after eating I got on my phone and got to business. 

There is nowhere in the country I’ve been that I haven’t been able to find heroin with either craigslist or other means. I scrolled through the posts on New York’s craigslist and soon discovered some of the slang used for dope there. Dog food was one that isn’t as common on the West Coast but seemed fairly popular in NY. Many of them were clear scams but there were a lot on there and I ended up messaging about 10 different posts. 

After that, I hopped on Tinder and was pleasantly surprised to see that I was seemingly in high demand with the women of New York. I got several matches right away and many more through the entire trip. Now it was the waiting game. I had cast my sex and drugs net out and now I would wait to see what would catch.

Fast forward through another relatively boring day of sight-seeing by myself and I was beginning to get responses on both the sex and drugs front. By then I was chatting with 6 or 7 women, and 3 or 4 alleged drug dealers. I won’t go into the process of how, but I’m pretty well versed in identifying veritable drug dealers and those who are either cops or scam artists. By the end of the second night there, I had my search narrowed down to two drug dealers and two women, all of whom were willing to meet.

My first choice in drug dealers was a guy who went by Rook and was located around Harlem. I wanted to go through him to get the dope but he ended up not being down to sell me such a “small” amount. I wanted $100 worth of it, at most. I obviously didn't have much of a tolerance due to being off heroin and was only in NY for a few days anyway. I was not willing to bring drugs back on the airplane with me. I have done it before and  I didn’t want to go through that headache again.

So I resorted to my second choice, Ted. I could tell the guy was black and it was clearly a fake name, but that’s reasonable. He was down to sell me the amount I wanted and he said to hit him up the next day anytime after 2pm. He was very clearly a little suspect of me and  he seemed worried that I was a cop myself; all of which, by the way, were very good signs that he was indeed legit. I was pretty certain this was some low level dealer or, more likely, some sort of middle-man. 

Ted gave me the general area of which we would meet. It was in Brooklyn. Cool, I have always wanted to check out Brooklyn. I looked up the cross streets on Google maps to get an idea of the neighborhood, and I was a little demoralized to see that the area was the straight-up motherfucking projects. Just like from all the drug dealer movies I’d seen. Ugh. Fuck. 

This is going to turn into a whole thing isn’t it? I thought to myself.

Im overwhelmed by the support i got from you guys so shout out to all you guys and gals your all awesome, this community really is great. So this is a bit of an update i guess.

Anyways so i had a long discussion with this girl ive been dating almost a month now who i ended up using with. I explained that i have an addiction to oxy and any opiate substance really. I told her i should have been way more upfront about my problem and that it wasn’t her fault. She felt extremely bad for putting me in that situation and as someone who doesn’t use regularly she feels awful. I explained there was a lack of communication on both are sides but ultimately the decision to use was mine. That i don’t want her to feel like shit over my screw up and that it really wasn’t her fault, and i honestly believe that i’m not just telling her this to make her feel better. So we basically broke up and i feel awful, she really is a great girl and even though we haven’t know each other too long there was a real connection happening. She made me feel something for the first time in awhile after my last relationship that was purely ruled and run by addiction, it was just like going through the motions. But ive convinced my brain that i cant be around others who use because ill never get clean because i know thats whats for the best. Unfortunately my heart feels otherwise.

So she ends up texting me explaining that she really likes me and cares about me. She wants me to get clean and still feels bad about everything that happens, in the 1 month ive know her she has a way of always making me feel better about things. She told me that everyone makes mistakes and that you gotta keep on moving on, but that she wants to stay with me. She promises me that she wont use any drugs anymore if thats what it takes to be with me. She has never lied to me of given me any reason not to trust her.

So my issues is i really like this girl, i know it’s probably for the best that we split up so i can stay clean but at the same time this girl is really great. Should i really be risking my chances at sobriety on a girl ive only known for a month but who makes me really happy and i do care about just because she says she wont use anymore? Do i give her a shot? Idk guys im really lost in the situation and i would appreciate some opinion, i think i know what the right thing to do is but its damn hard.

Big update: Thanks for all the advice and support my opi fam! Ive decided to continue the relationship. I know i still have a lot to work on but im hoping that i can atleast be happy. This girl obviously really cares about me and i dont wanna through away the first glimpse of real happiness ive had i months. I really like this girl and i wanna make it work, i only pray she keeps true to her word, but I realize that only i can control my own urges and actions. Thanks again to everyone who took the time to reply, wish me luck!",1538250992.0

So with that being said, I was thinking of just being honest— telling her that it’s working but not enough and that I think 2mg/ day would be better. The reason why I am a little hesitant is because she knows I used to do dope and that I am an addict in general, and I really don’t want her to be like, “Is it really because you need it?” Type shit. So what do you guys think? Because at this point I’m going through those 60 pills for the month in 10 days, and I fucking hate doing that because when I NEED them I don’t have them.

This morning I’m supposed to meet Sal’s guy.

He said 10 last night, so I’m up early. Do a shot. Smoke a cigarette and run to the bank. This is me going all in. I’m taking the money my grandmother left me out of the bank. When there’s something I know I shouldn’t do and don’t actually want to do, when I’m about to be stupid, my mind does this thing where it just goes blank. Like, it knows how to walk me to the ATM outside of my bank. My brain remembers the pin number and how to operate the screen. It tells my feet how to get back to the motel, but it doesn’t think about what’s really going on. My mind somehow pushes out the painful reality, the sickening thought of going back on my grandmother’s will for me and the money she left me. It was sort of a joke when I told you that she didn’t want me to spend it. I mean. That was a slight exaggeration, but she’d throw a fit if she knew I was about to take that 8000 dollars and use it to buy a major amount of heroin. I am coming up today. Today changes everything.

As I get back to the room and walk through the parking lot, there’s no movement. No body outside. No cars running. It’s just silent and dismal under the sunless sky, like time’s inertia got frozen still somehow and stuck in the grey crystal of this moment, because outside of the trap motel, outside of every trap motel all across America, it’s always the same. Hard. Miserable, and everyone is looking to come up.

Well, I got mine, and I’m holding this huge wad of bills in my hand inside of my pocket as I get back to the room. There’s this sign on the door, though. It’s taped up and the words are scrawled onto it pretty poorly. I’m guessing some boys from middle school wrote and left it. It reads:

Hey Dill Hole,

We know what you been doing. Stop it. Or we’ll get you.

The reason I say that middle schoolers wrote it is because I can’t think of anyone who would ever address someone as dill hole that wasn’t in middle school. Shoot, that probably ends in fifth grade. Anyone still saying dill hole in sixth grade must be a special case, and so, I don’t really know what the letter’s about, but I’m doing all kinds of bad things. People are getting hurt. I think of Beth and her daughter. Lives are being ruined mine included, and I just came down from all that meth. There’s a dirty gun under my bed. Paranoia is still lingering, as I open the door and walk into the room. My intentions haven’t changed, though. I’m still going to buy a lot of heroin. Sal is taking me to meet his man in a bit, and just like that, a horn is honking outside.",1538208944.0

I’m in a new area and a homeless man came up to me and asked for a cigarette. This was my plan as I was just hanging out by a gas station which is in a known area for drug use. As I was giving it to him I asked him if he was able to score boy. He said yes and I offered to buy him some as well. We walked for a little while towards the spot and he asked to use my phone. I kept my guard up but he was an older man and I’m a fairly big guy. After he hung up he asked for the money to go grab it. I was hesitant about breaking that rule but I was only getting $20 worth so I was okay with loosing that honestly. I’m also not physically dependent as of now so it wasn’t like I was withdrawing. 

I give it to him and he runs around the corner of this building and a minute later returns with a cap. He gives it to me and we walk to an area that we can both use. While there I meet another guy who this homeless man knew. I’m introduced to him and after I do my stuff and get to know him I take down the new persons number. Both the homeless guy and the other person I met are pretty alright people, I may not know them well at all but I get good vibes from them. I mean shit the homeless guy could have tried to rob me if he really wanted too. 

So anyway some time goes by and tonight I call up this new guy since I couldn’t find the homeless man. We agree to meet up and he said he knows someone who can get what I need and I tell him I will give him $10 out of my $50 in total to get what he wants. Once I get to him we begin to walk to this dealers place. We make small talk and I offer him some cigarettes. I ask him if he’s seen the homeless man and I come to find out that he made it to rehab! Was not expecting to hear that but was honestly happy, good for him. So we finally get there and there’s these two black dudes outside, ones on the phone trying to arrange some shit and sounds kind of pissed off over money and the other dude has us go inside to wait. 

We walk in and there’s a guy playing madden on an Xbox one, a woman and some guy both also sitting there waiting to be served. It’s a little awkward honestly but we just sat and waited.. you know how that goes. Finally the dude who was on the phone before walks in, still on the phone but begins to serve people. It’s our turn and the guy who was middling for me gets it and then turns to show it to me to ask if it’s good. I tell him yeah I’m cool with it. It’s in a small little baggie and it seemed like a decent 40 for where I’m at. Wasn’t in a cap like last time and where I’m from it’s usually in plastic bags tied up or wax bags. 

I decided to introduce myself to his plug and the first thing he says is “you ain’t a cop or nothin’.” I think to myself it probably would of been better to ask before haha but whatever. I say no and show him an old track mark from when I used to shoot up. He’s like “ight, you want my number?” And of course I’m not going to miss this opportunity.. the guy middling was cool with it too he didn’t even care. I get the number and he tells me he’s got Molly too! I don’t really do Molly often but that’s good to know fuck it. 

Anyway I left and me and the dude went separate ways home. The stuff I got isn’t that great I can tell it’s pretty cut but I got like no tolerance so I’m still decently high. It’s better than getting beat. The cap I got the first time was better but I’m still happy.",1538208686.0

So a couple of days ago I wrote About trying to cold cop without much succes And was asking for tips.

Well afterwards I tried cold copping again. In the morning actually.
I was packed to get to work, being a technician I work in Many places. 

Arriving in The city at 7:30am just to be sure I was there first, I called my boss to ask for more detailed information About the job he gave me Intel About the previous sunday. 

So my boss being a fucker, didn’t respond at all, even though I could see him online on whatsapp.... I waited around for two hours until I said “fuck it Lets get some dope.” 

Walking around a few districts And talking to a few homeless people without succes, I found this dude looking at me, like he was trying to talk or offer something. 
So Yeah he was a dealer, offered me Some crack to buy but I Told him Im not into that speedy short-lived high. 
I asked him: “Do you maybe know Someone who has/sells Some brown?”

You have to understand that this dude was pretty drunk And fucked from other shit, he behaved pretty happy And proper Nice tho.

This dude tells me he knows Someone who sells Some brown. We called him And were going to meet up.
But fuck. His mobile was empty so there was no getting any dope.

He was actually a Nice dude, had Some unresolved things perhaps, but I look beyond those stereotypes And cloaks. 

In the end we just got a little drunk And later in the day ate Some food. We were chilling in bars, cafés, coffeeshops.. any fun place.

He didn’t want to help me get brown anymore, because he actually didn’t like seeing me on the street in the future. Because he had seen it happen before, with his friends.

He Also Told me his background, which was, compared to me, a whole lotta worse... Where i felt depressed About shit not working, he made motivation to just keep going And going And going.. his mindset was extraordinary. 
But with his background I understood why.

This all had me thinking a lot the last days, About whats important And how to do it.

Tl;dr:

Went to work, tried  coldcopping. Failed but made a valuable friend who made me realize important life lessons.
