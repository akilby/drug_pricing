I started doing it daily since it felt so good obviously. I have ADHD and probably some other shit, so my normal just feels like shit. So H made me more productive and sociable and felt better than normal constantly just doing it like every couple hours, daily for 6 months. And then something happened. I ran out since I wasn't close to my stash for 10 days, and I was hella withdrawing for the entire time. I got home, and dosed and everything felt great and back to normal. And then the next couple days, I start feeling bad again even though I'm doing dope. Turns out the new batch I got was cut with fent, and the other one I got was cut with Benadryl. So I stopped doing that shit and got some awesome fire dope. But the awesome fire dope doesn't make me feel euphoric like awesome fire dope used to make me feel. I've always bumped, and for some reason my tolerance never goes up. So I've been doing the same dose for a year. About 20mg gets me into this like stoned high state, but without the positive feelings and body high that I'm used to. And on top of that, I'm no longer productive or socialble like I was when I was on it before. I've tried dosing more but it doesn't help, just makes me feel more stoned and sleepy for like an hour. I'm 100% sure I'm doing fire dope now. I know before I had to do the same batch for like a week or two to get accustomed to it, and start getting high high off it. Has anyone else experienced this previously? I know people usually reach a certain point where it doesn't get you high anymore, and you just have to do it to not get sick. But I feel like I'm not there yet, since the same dose does it for me like it always has. I honestly don't know, I'm open to suggestions. I'm gonna order some oxy and hydromorphone since they always make me feel euphoric as hell.

The big deal for me is still no energy - I watch people walking around outside my window and wonder how the hell are you doing that? That is amazing. 

So I have read up on the whole paws thing and the consensus among medical guys seems to be that your dopamine is messed up and that's what is causing you to be sick, even though you have been clean for 2 months to possibly even 2 years.

Now I am starting to wonder whether these people know what they are talking about. The more I read, the more I am starting to doubt the dopamine story. There are a few scientists that say there are other neuro transmitters responsible for paws, not dopamine.

Hmm, ok. So if that is true, what is really going on?

Personally, I have tried a number of cutting edge supplements purported to raise dopamine levels. Over several weeks, I have not seen much in the way of results.

So let's say you entertain my theory. What else could it be? There are many diseases that can cause low energy, anxiety, depression, etc. but let's posit that you were ok while you were using so you probably don't have any new disease.

There is one other explanation that fits the bill, from what I can see. I am wondering if paws is a result of the suppression of the hormone testosterone.

If you google this, you will find that lowered sex drive and loss of energy, fatigue are all hallmarks of low testosterone. Testosterone also plays a big part in self confidence, aggressive drive and general motivation.

Sound familiar? I sure as shit am no big stud at this point. I feel weak, I don't want to engage, I am very non-aggressive. In short, I am the worst version of me. I am the opposite of me.

It is a proven fact that opiates can lower hormone levels. Google it if you doubt me.

What do people say helps more than anything with paws?

Exercise. It is almost universal that people will tell you that this is critical in dealing with this condition. And exercise is one sure way to raise testosterone levels.

What other links exist? 

Diet - a common advice for paws is to eat plenty of protein which contain amino acids that are precursors to dopamine. Surprise! Amino acids are also vital for testosterone and other anabolic hormones. 

I could go on but I am getting tired of typing. Suffice it to say that factors that could possibly increase dopamine levels correlate closely with factors that increase testosterone levels.

Hopefully some medical people will read this. I don't want to be excessively insulting, but the medical pharmaceutical professions have a long history of leading us down the garden path.

Like valium is not addictive. Heroin is not addictive. Psych drugs are safe and effective and you will not have any withdrawal symptoms when you stop taking them. Your problem is cholesterol, not all that sugar you eat.

All of these statements were made by medicos when these drugs first came out or when heart disease was first studied.

Doctors, like many humans, tend to follow the party line. They will spout the most amazing bullshit with a straight face if you don't educate yourself. They have created many addicts as I am sure you guys know. So I no longer trust that this guy who went to school for like twenty years and has a lot of experience is better equipped than me to analyze facts. Because I have a magic weapon named google.

I guess time will tell, but if you are not having any success relieving your paws symptoms, check out testosterone. There is a ton of information about it because of all our great athletes who use roids to enhance their performance.

I had previously ordered some and ig the dude screwed up and sent another identical amount a month or so later. I told a couple people the story and one dude kept asking for free coke and I said no since he is greedy with his shit and never shares so he dropped it.

Plus, he wanted hundreds of dollars worth for free and is addicted to anything and everything now. Ive known him since kindergarten. I have been ordering shit for him fairly often and the last coke package was for him so he is technically the reason this pack came. After turning him down he didnt mention it. that was a day or two ago. Then today he gets some other shit from me which he has money for. He takes xanax (prob to get the balls to do me over when he knows ive never done anything wrong to him) when Im over and he says he has a friend who will get the rest of the coke. I am desperate to get rid of it as I never wanted it in my possession in the first place, and trusted that he wouldnt try anything since we have been good friends for life. So i say ok and go home to get it. 

When I go back I get it out (which ik is dumb since you should always see money before you put the drugs out) and he basically doesnt pay me and says i fucked him over for not giving him free stuff since he was the reason the package came. He did me over basically. I could have stole it back in that moment or fought them since I am stronger than both him and his friend and am in great fighting shape or something but I didnt even care and plus I didnt know if they would be crazy enough to use knives or something of the sort. I got it for free and I found it so pathetic he is so addicted that he would do me over like that when Ive known him since age 5. I wasn't trying to get the coke back since I was just trying to get rid of it to start. He prob did the whole 8 ball of scale in like a day or less. I shouldn't have been giving him that shit to start with. Now hes a junkie that chooses a coke high for a day over lifelong friends and has nobody left in his life besides that one other guy who he put up to doing it. Oh well. 

It is sad to me that he has come to this point and is a true addict with no money left that has to steal to get by. I usually get very pissed whenever people take money from me, but in this case I just want to be done with it all and move on. Selling coke isnt a good idea and I dont even care I dont have it anymore. Living the way those guys are living, the only couple of outcomes are death, jail, or worse. Some day they will screw over the wrong person. I am not afraid of them, but I want to be the bigger person and let this go as I have plenty of money and drugs and nothing I do to his car or whatever would be paid for by him. It would be paid for by his parents who are nice people and I dont want to inflict that on them. The way I see it, I paid 0 dollars and 0 cents to find out that he is a shithead that cant be trusted. Getting revenge over this makes me still involved in the whole coke dealing thing which I dont want to be. I wish him luck in life. Clearly he will need it. I also feel like if it werent this time he would have just tried something like this another time and it was only a matter of time",1548335406.0

More or less I was told that they do not allow sale or purchase of drugs on premises... I was then told that drug use is not ""allowed"", however they do have a bathroom (didn't check it out but surely it has a sharps bin, maybe more), and I guess the policy is that you may ""use"" the bathroom *wink-wink* for 10 minutes max... they check in on you after 5 minutes through an intercom.

I was blown away by this needle exchange. I'm mad at myself for all the dull barbed rigs I've reused, they let you take as many as you'd like within reason and don't require a count and exchange to get more. They also, like the one lady said, ""make it rain narcan"". I try to grab some every time I go down there, I've got a little stockpile and plan to pass some out to some people I know. Oh and holy shit they even gave me micron filters when I asked! Not wheel filters, but these cool ones I've never seen before that fit like a sheath over the tip of the needle. Sterifilt they are called. Super easy and fun to use. 

I don't know how other needle exchanges are, but I was really impressed with everything about the place. Not to mention the exchange is only one small part of the (beautiful and clean) health facility. Gonna check out the Hep C test next.

TL;DR, my needle exchange has a bathroom that your *wink* not allowed to shoot up in. Sounds like the closest thing to a safe injection facility in the US, and I'm curious if other harm reduction exchanges have such an ""understanding"" in regards to drug use on premises. ",1548322736.0

I think they must understand that, & in the end it all cums down to financial interests. A good example is how the DEA STILL has kratom on their list of “drugs of concern”, all while big pharma companies are currently experimenting with mitragynine & analogues of it for a new, patentable analgesic. Hypocrisy at its finest! If ppl could simply go to a pharmacy & outright buy some oxy or w/e their opioid of choice is, how much safer would that be? You’d know the exact dosage, you’d be positive it’s not laced with fucking fentanyl, & you’d never have to deal with shady drug dealers who only go by “T” lol. You could drive home with the opies in your glovebox & never have to worry over getting caught with them, you’d be doing nothing wrong.

The thing is, which is also my question, after the effects wore off (about 6 hours later), I didn’t go back to my previous mental state. My depression was less stronger. When I woke up the next morning, I wasn’t experiencing any sad thoughts or overthinking the same depressing shit. Is this common? Do Opioids really help with depression?

I'm a veteran amputee with severe phantom pain. 

Currently I am seen at the VA by just my Primary Care. He prescribes me lyrica 150mg 3 times a day and 10/325 hydrocodone 1-2 pills a day as needed. 

Last week he called me in for a drug test that I was completely ok taking since I had took a pain med. The morning prior. I called this morning to get a refill on my medication and he said he could no longer prescribe my pain medication since the UA came back negative for opiates. 

I'm at a loss on what to do. Can I go to another doctor with failing the drug test? Iv tried a lot of other options for treating the pain but the pain medication is what gets me through at the moment. ",1548284996.0

I take 1-2 mg a day, occasionally I take more but I don't like the tease of a high it gives me. Up until a week ago everything has been fine I know I should be doing more if I really want to stay clean, but who the fucks got time to go to 12 step meetings or go see a therapist. I'm only 22 so you know I love to have fun more than I like to do what's good for me. 

Anyway so the last 6 months have been great. No drugs whatsoever accept weed and alcohol( and subs ofc) But last week this happened...

I'm locked inside my garage sweating and hyperventilating. Waves of anticipation wash over me as I pull out my H and some soft I got just minutes before. My coworker got it from out of state and supposedly it's fire. I go to mix up a shot but my hands are shaking like a motherfucker. Deep breath, gotta relax and make sure I don't fuck this up. I reach into the rafters and pull down the rig hidden there. Its old, the numbers are faded or gone completely, and I grimace knowing it's dull as a spoon. I've got everything ready to go. I bite a bit of cigarette filter off and drop it into the rig cap. In goes .2 of water and my heart is beating like a cannon. 

Wait what the fuck was that sound? Frozen I strain to hear under the glare of the bare bulb hanging above me. I imagine lindsey bursting in, and that ugly light illuminating an even uglier truth. In my mind's eye flash images of her beautiful face marred by tears and her expression contorted by pain. But she's still inside and still oblivious. Shame and guilt beat my conscience to death but at this point I'm in auto pilot. I feel less anticipation and I feel calmer as a sit on the floor and take off my shoe. I tie my headphones around my ankle and find a nice juicy one.

I remove the tie off. Finally. It's all going to go away. My fear. My pain. My confusion, my stress, everything. I tell myself once a feel that bliss I will be okay. And it's coming. I can feel that warm blanket wrapping around my chest and... It stops. A slight warmth. 

I was devastated. Was it because of my sub tolerance? Was the work just garbage? I tried again the next morning. This time I got the coke hit, heart thudding and I can taste it in the back of my throat, but still no opiate warmth or pleasure. After several more failed attempts I gave up. 

That's it. I'm back on subs but my psyche is a mess. My brain is still screaming at me to get high constantly, which the subs previously suppressed. I'm shaken and scared. Poor Lindsey found my rigs the day I put them in my bag to toss them out. I feel like such a shit. It really, really hurt her. And I still can't talk to her about it because I'm still trying to process it myself. Sorry for spraying y'all like this just had to get it out some how.",1548285455.0

Tramadol came into my possession and after doing some research and staring at the pill for about an hour going back and forth in my mind, I decide to take one then wait 30 minutes and take another one.
The plan was to take 100mg or 150 max and if I didn’t feel anything then that was that.
So at 100mg I start zoning out just a little bit and decide one more won’t hurt, so I’m in my room zoning out and with a noticeably elevated mood and think “this is fucking great, I’ll cap it at 200mg”. It was 3 AM at that point, after that I vaguely remember walking around my house then, next thing I know, it’s 8AM and I’m waking up from my bed.

Nothing seems wrong at this point, though I’m having trouble remembering last night. Then I try to stand up and was instantly greeted by my couch again and the nausea hits me. I spend the next few hours on my couch, sipping water and feeling like shit. I make trips to the bathroom to throw up but keep falling asleep on the toilet seat but only for a few seconds. I keep having short but very vivid dreams. Eventually I throw up twice and am now feeling slightly better but it took hours.

Never touching an opiate ever again, that was a nightmare",1548282191.0

A little about me:

I started popping Oxy 5mg about 10 years ago after some dental work and fell in love. I slowly but surely moved up to Oxy 30mgs. I have pretty severe anxiety and pot and alcohol just makes it worse, so they aren’t efficient ways to help me cope. Oxy really helps mellow me out and gives me some relief from my anxiety.

I buy 3 every Friday and split them into halves and quarters  to try to make them last to the following Friday, but rationing them makes me have to pick and choose what days I can use them and it’s a bummer. I’d buy more at a time but I live in a state where they’re $40 a pill and I don’t have the best paying job.

I’m just curious; are they generally this expensive in other states? Also, does anyone have any advice/alternatives that would help with my situation?Should I just tough it out and quit? I know I’m addicted but I don’t feel like I’m so far gone were I can’t quit if I gave it my all. Sorry for rambling, I’m just completely alone here. There’s no one I can turn to.

Now that I’m 18 I can be honest, but I’ve been posting on this sub to ask questions and just talk to fellow junkies since I was 16.

Back to the detox. I am going to a psychiatric facility, a psych hospital, for detox either this evening or tomorrow morning. I’m telling my parents (which I still live with) that I am going to get off the Suboxone, and they believe me. Now that I’m 18, they won’t be contacted by the facility for anything, so I don’t have to worry about that.

The other times I’ve been, I went as a 17 year old and was therefore admitted as an adolescent and into an adolescent unit. I liked this, being able to talk to people my age rather than 50 and 60 year old real loons. The adolescent unit was mostly full of about 9 or 10 suicidal teens, mostly friendly and 100% approachable.

When I went at 17, I went for a week to detox, relapsed the day I got out, and was back at the same hospital a week later for an intentional heroin overdose. My buddies from before we’re still there, and the staff, particularly the adolescent therapy guy, were super cool. I developed a pretty close relationship with the therapist. We still talk sometimes.

Anyways, I just turned 18 a month ago. My parents don’t even know I relapsed over a month ago. They think I’ve still been on Suboxone this whole time. The truth is, I had to go without my Suboxone for 10 days back in December due to an insurance issue, and I couldn’t handle 10 days without it. I relapsed hard and when I finally got my script I traded it with my plug. 30 8 mg strips for a quarter. Seemed like a good deal to me. Too bad I blew through it in a week.

So, I’m returning to the facility as an adult for detox. I’m hoping it’s as pleasant as my first 2 experiences as an adolescent. I hope they give me subs and clonidine and ambien again. I hope there are fellow patients there that I can actually talk to. 

Anyways, wish me luck guys. I feel like this time is gonna be it. I feel like I’ll actually stay on the right track this time. 

Btw, my intention is to get back on Suboxone maintenance. We’ll see how receptive they are to that idea.",1548269270.0

Is it possible for someone without a history of prior opioid abuse to experience mild withdrawal like symptoms after 2 weeks of taking 5-15 mg of hydrocodone? If so, how long should it last? If so, is it true that the same dosage could now cause the same symptoms after less consecutive days of use?

I took 5-15 mg of hydrocodone with a few (2 or 3) tylenol 3s on the days I only took 5mg for 2 weeks straight. I have some neck/back problems. Nothing near what many people deal with that warrants consistent pain management, but I have days that are bad enough where I can't focus on anything I'm doing or what people are saying to me because I'm so aware of the pain. So occasionally I'll get a few pain killers from someone who has them. By occasional I mean it probably averages out to a couple days a month over the year but some months it's none and some months it's as many as 10 days.

This is the 1st time I've taken some consecutively for more than a few days. My back problems have been worse than ever lately, but on the 3 or 4 good days I took some anyway because honestly I wanted to avoid dealing with some emotional shit that was making me depressed and in turn giving me insomnia. Otherwise I've never abused opiates before, but did enjoy the high. My best friend was addicted to heroin when we were 18-20 and I've been around while some fucked up shit went down so I was really turned off to the idea of even taking them if prescribed for a while. I've also had an issue with stimulants many years ago so I knew the combo of a psychological addiction with physical dependence would be messy. But I never really witnessed anyone in the midst of the first days of withdrawals.

I wasn't going to take one Sunday (day 15) but I woke up from an afternoon nap aching all over and feeling feverish. I thought I was getting sick with the flu and took one so I could hopefully sleep lots and successfully fight off the bug. So now I haven't taken a pain killer since Sunday night. Monday and Tuesday my joints (fingers and knees) and shins were aching kind of like growing pains, I couldn't seem to get comfortable trying to sleep and kept tossing and turning, and at times my temperature regulation was all off. All annoying enough to make the day less enjoyable, especially the aches, but nothing bad enough to prevent me from doing anything I needed to do. Basically just enough to make getting into a movie or falling asleep tricky. I also had some loose stool, but no increased frequency, and I have some GI problems so that happens sometimes. Today (Wednesday) I'm still achey but I also have stomach cramping and really have the shits (to the point I'm working from home) which is much more severe than any issues I would normally have.

My husband takes 1mg of suboxone a day but will be 3 years clean in a month (so proud!!!) after 10 years of shooting dope. When describing/complaining that I must be fighting off some weird bug last night he said it kind of seems like I'm having very mild withdrawal symptoms. I took some gabapentin (my rx actually but I opted to never take it and gave it to him for if/when he tries to get off his suboxone completely) and I was able to get comfortable to sleep and my joints stopped aching as bad but my regular back pain didn't go away. It seems crazy to me that such light use for 15 days could cause symptoms and that maybe it's a combo of some other things including a stomach bug instead.

Is it really that possible it's mild withdrawal? If so, shouldn't I feel better tomorrow? I feel bad asking my husband much more and making it seem like I'm complaining when I know this is nothing compared to what being dope sick truly is, especially since I've been complaining about my actual bad back pain so much more lately.

My husband also said that if it is that then if I ever do need to take painkillers again I might need to be more careful because it's more likely I'd have these symptoms again after less consecutive days of use. Is that true? He wasn't too sure on that since I never take a large dose and he was a pretty heavy user (At least I think it must be considered heavy...we first became friends when he was 2 weeks clean but he was prescribed 24mg of suboxone a day at first which is more than I've usually heard and said he was still very dope sick for the first 3 or 4 days). Apart from that, I guess it doesn't matter that much to know what's going on but I work as a scientist studying the brain and medical ""mysteries"" just drive me crazy.

Even if this isn't from opiods and even though I've lost many friends to heroin addiction over the years, experiencing a bug that kind of resembles withdrawal symptoms at just a small fraction of the intensity brings about a whole new level of understanding and compassion toward the struggles. Many congrats to those who are clean and much love to anyone who has struggled with opioid addiction past or present < 3",1548267681.0

aj1pw1,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/aj1pw1/opiates_energy_and_girls/,23,https://redd.it/aj1pw1,realcat67,"Opiates, Energy and Girls"," So I’m a male ex-junkie, musing on my many strange experiences over 18 years of opiate addiction.

My first real experience was with codeine at 13 years old. It was a real WOW moment for me. I felt relaxed and no longer anxious about being around other kids. I could sleep easily. But this only lasted a short time as doctor quickly refused refills.

At 18, I shot H for the first time. Love at first bite. No more worries, loved the nod. I tended to isolate myself. At that point, I really was not interested in any interaction with the universe. I just wanted to shoot dope and dream.

But the universe had its own ideas and soon everything changed. The same dope that made me nod morphed into a substance that energized me. Now I became functional, sorta. It was easy for me to chat up friends and appear mostly normal. I became charming and fun to talk to. I went out to bars and no longer had any social anxiety. 

Yeah, that shit didn’t last. 

As time went on, I cared less and less about people. If I didn’t have any dope, I became a raging, crying bitch, who would trample and destroy anyone in his way like a Star Destroyer mauling the cute little smurf guys on tv.

Girls – nah. You might be cute and sexy but eventually you are going to start bitching and I am totally less interested in you than in my dope. Sorry gorgeous, that’s the name of that tune. 

Family – are you kidding? I’m not even gonna pick up the phone. Unless of course you want to give me money like my birthday or something. Then I am all ears.

Work – yup, as long as I have a shot.

At this point, I still got a rush from shooting but the nod was totally gone. Paradoxically, I needed the dope for energy. Without it, I could not function. I may be a little unusual in that I never really had much of a problem with anxiety or depression. Most of my family was the same way. Typically, we soldiered on. If something bad happened you dealt with it. Don’t worry about what you can’t control would have been our family motto.

Be that as it may, the equation of dope equals life became my guiding principal. Without it, I became Smeagol, weak and pathetic, crying out for my precious from whatever hole in the ground I managed to wrangle that week.

By this time, I would not even entertain any notion of having friends or any more human interaction than I absolutely had to have. I might wave at you, but that was pretty much it. I needed my precious energy to chase dope and could not spare any for friends, family or girls. 

Which meant I was alone. If I did engage in any company, it was almost always an ally for mutual support. But we were not friends. It was always about partners in crime, of which I had my share.

Eventually I got busted and thrown into the hole to suffer. It was over a month before I saw a judge, so I was sort of sober and he cut me loose.

Of course, I immediately started using again. But I think a seed was planted and eventually, after too many adventures, I quit.

My biggest problem was – no more energy. I was clean but walking across the room was literally too hard for me. It took about 5 weeks in my case to be able to move around. 

I was exhausted. I would look out the window and see people walking and wondered how they did it.

What actually helped was the following:

Exercise

Caffine

Amino acids

Sudafed

My brain was trashed and I needed to heal. I started on Lions mane mushrooms and eventually – a few more weeks, I started to feel better. This was, I believe, a result of my 18 years of daily use, at a rate of 1 – 2 grams per day.

I actually feel lucky that it was a relatively short period. 2 months from the day I quit, the sun was shining again, girls were pretty and people morphed back into regular people and became interesting, instead of being the dreary coach roaches that existed only to plague me with their bullshit.

If you’re on the dark side, I hope this helps. I really hate the idea of anyone being stuck in heroin hell.

Love going out right now, to your emotional rescue!",1548262480.0

There are two days every week(tuesdays and thursdays) on which I need some medication to deal with my anxiety, so I’ve thought about self medicating tramadol(only opiate I can get sufficient access to) on only those two days each week. Ive had some experience with codeine and hydrocodone, but have never tried tramadol yet.

I’m not worried about addiction that much, since I don’t enjoy the opioid high; I always took moderate doses to only cope with anxiety. However, I’m worried that tolerance might easily build up, resulting in paying too much for drugs to maintain the effects. 

I’ve also heard stories about people having seizures at high doses of tramadol, so I want to keep the doses low. Btw I dont have access to kratom, so please don’t recommend me that

Before that I was doing H every day for a year and around 1g a day. After I stopped the methadone I it took 5 days before I felt any withdrawal and let me tell you those 5 days felt so freeing I felt normal again not having to take soemthing every day. 

 So I was unlucky as just as withdrawal hit I had to go back to work. Was hoping to get the worst of it over on the weekend. But monday roles around I have very little withdrawal symptoms but I can feel it starting. Tuesday was a little worse had some rls but I took 600mg gabapetin and that stopped it through the day  I also felt very fatigued and unmotivated so I did smoke a small amount of meth at the start of thr work day.


Now according to most reports day 3-5 are the worst. But with my motabolism is may be different.
I'm in day 3 now. I had woken up the previous days feeling pretty rough lots of rsl and stomach issues. So I took 1500mg gaba before I went to bed slept like a baby  and woke up a bit better than the previous days . I did have some uncontrollable bowels as I did my morning routine but I wasnt in pain and wishing I wasn't there. I took 600mg gaba before work and am honsetly feeling great. No symptoms I've never once had a runny nose or puked. Mind you I havent eaten much onyl one meal a day for evening meal.  I again smoked a bit off Meth to get me foccussed. I should probably mention I do have adhd so Meth works a bit different it brings me up to normal levels.


So I guess we will see where the next few days takes us. I have my routine of gaba sorted i wouldn't mange it without it. And Meth if I need it to wake up a bit.

This almost seems too easy. Sure I don't feel great. But I'm not wanting to rip my skin off and run away.


So if this only lasts 1-2 weeks at decreaseing strength I'm home free. I have had no cravings. Usualy I'd be dreaming about it. Or constantly thinking about it. I imagine once I stop the gaba they will come but I'll tell them to fuck off. I'm done with this shit £200 a week down the drain for the past year and half.


3 cold turkey attempts in the past. Tried the same as this time before but had no gaba. Gaba is a life saver.",1548244353.0

i cried to him and he cried to me saying how he feels so bad and he won’t do it and if he happens to he’ll let me know, but he’d be stopping all together and he’s not gonna lie to me anymore 

After that curiosity, got the best of me (of course) and i saw texts on his phone asking someone if they wanna meet up to shoot cause he just got a bag and things like that 
and he continues to lie to me and say that he’s not doing it and has stopped

*They are out there.* A friend of mine who lives in the NE has a connection that refuses to buy any supply poisoned with fentanyl.

I have heard people say heroin are not really good without cocaine and so on and i get that speedballs are popular for a reason. I would also like to know what stimulants mix well with opiods and vice versa. I heard some people find meth to strong and overpower the experience.

Anyhow i got a bag of some great white #4 and some suburb coke as well as Vyvanse and Oxycodone in front of me, but i cant figure which ones to mix for the evening. I don't do iv. The coke and Heroin will be snorted if i go that route and the Oxycodone and Vyvanse will obviously be eaten too since it only is active once it gets to your liver.

So whats best? Vyvanse + Oxy, Oxy + Coke, Heroin + Vyvanse or Coke + Heroin.

I’m currently 3 days from my last heroin dose. It’s been tough but suboxone (obviously) has made me feel infinitely better, If not completely fine. Other than the expected depression/cravings/no motivation

     The past 6 or so months have been the worst months In my entire life. Rewind to right before I relapsed I was in a goodish place. I had just gotten out of a 90 day jail sentence, I had started using kratom in place of other substances. Now keep in mind I had not even tried heroin at this point. Strongest narcotic I’ve had at this point was oxy. Soon enough, after getting out of jail and being clean for so long I was getting bored of kratom. The addict inside me was growing hungrier. Then in mid august, I had my wisdom teeth removed.

     Keep in mind that at this point I’m on probation for two years and was already searching for an excuse to use opiates again. Did I really need my wisdom teeth removed THAT bad? Absolutely not. Did the addict inside me know that there was a possibility I could milk the fuck out of this for a few take home oxy’s/hydros? Of course. I also knew that I could use opiates on probation with a prescription. Bingo.. Everything I needed to do to make sure that the next two weeks to MAYBE a month were going to be a wild ride. Although I don’t think I was prepared for how wild this ride would be. And It sure as fuck didn’t stop after a month.

     Once I ran through my prescription. Which was with a CWE and taking the whole damn bottle, with only a slight high, I knew I had to find something else. So I made the worst mistake of my life and hit up a “friend” I met in jail. The SECOND my name popped up on his facebook messenger, it was already over. This evil mother fucker knew exactly how to manipulate me. He was an evil genius. He tells me at first that he can  get me some codeine pills. Of course I take him to go get these and the pills don’t get me high. So here I am, pissed, Desperate to drown my demons. On the ride home he tells me to stop by his “friends” house. I told him I’m pissed, that I’m going home, fuck this, so on and so forth. He’s like I got just the thing you need. Ever heard of opium? 

     He then continues to pull out a black rock looking substance, a foil, a lighter, and a straw. I freeze completely. This looks fucking dangerous. But It’s only opium right? As long as it’s not heroin. He smokes it for me. I sit back and experience the best high I have ever had. Wow. From that SECOND, I was off to the races. 

    Fast forward a month. Still buying this shit from the dude I met in jail. Getting high as fuck. Going back to the dentist complaining about pain just to get another prescription. It worked surprisingly well. I have hid this addiction from absolutely everyone. Now I’m not a TOTAL idiot. Pretty close but not completely. I was skeptical of it the whole time. I knew there was a chance this was heroin but I didn’t want to believe it. Well I come home one night high as fuck like noddin everywhere and i’m living at my parents at this time.. my dad being an ex heroin addict knows exactly what’s going on and asks what’s up. Me and my father have an honest relationship. I tell my dad everything and in return he doesn’t breathe down my neck. He’s super cool, maybe too cool. My favorite human on this planet. Anyway he asks what I’m on, I tell him it’s only opium and I smoked too much of it with a friend. He asks me If I have any left, I said I do. He asks to see it. At this point he doesn’t believe it’s opium obviously because he knows what BTH is obviously. So he looks at me and says, this is fucking heroin you idiot. I’m stunned but not too shocked. I say that this isn’t heroin and that he told me it was opium and at this point I’m trying to convince myself that it’s not heroin. He then goes and grabs two knives and a straw and fucking takes a hit. I’m blown away I’ve smoked weed with my dad many times but this was crazy. I take a hit. We both take a couple more and he looks at me and says. This Is 100% BTH and good shit too. You might be thinking, what kind of parent would smoke this with there kids? Stfu had it not been for that my dumbass would of never known and after my dad found out I was doing heroin, he instantly switched to parent mode on my ass made me delete this guys contact. Get rid of my shit. Offer to buy me a lot of kratom. Very supportive. But I’m too much of an addict.

     I had then stopped for a week and continued to use kratom. Only problem was, kratom stopped working. Instantly. No matter the dose was, less is more all that, nothing worked. Pissed as fuck, I find the dudes contact in the depths of my missed call logs and grab a bag of heroin. 

     This continued for 5 months. Lying, stealing, in and out of withdrawal, dealing with scummy people, violating probation, losing my friends, getting kicked out of my house, going to jail, detoxing in jail. And finally trying to get rid of the dude I met in jail, once and for all. 

     2 weeks ago I caught a theft charge on felony probation. Might have to do a considerable amount of jail time. My probation officer told me that If I start a suboxone program/outpatient program by the end of two weeks that there’s a possibility I can stay out of jail. I’m now 3 days clean from H on subs which isn’t shit but It’s something. I want to get high so fucking bad. I want to feel contempt. I want to escape but I know that If I do I will fall quicker than before. I need help. I’m suffocating and so fucking scared. I’m only 21 years old and have already fucked up so badly. I don’t know if I deserve success. I don’t see a future for myself anymore, and honestly, If it weren’t for my father, I would of ended my life. 
     Subs are great and all for staying clean but they just don’t do the trick for me. Obviously I mean I’m an addict. Nothing will ever do me in like heroin and that’s just something I will have to accept. I wish I could feel the effects of kratom again. maybe one day I will, But for right now I feel more lost than I ever have.. 

    Sorry for the long story.. thanks for reading and some of the questions I have is, 

1) will I ever feel kratom again?
2) suboxone and kratom together would be considered pointless due to it’s blocking effects correct?",1548185372.0

Today, I was thinking about taking the rest of what I have, 37.5mg + 40mg DXM, and abstaining for a month or two.

I've read that opiate tolerance shoots up very fast when used daily and never truly goes away, but only really in regards to long-time users. Would that be the case here too though, considering I started out with no tolerance and would be taking a moderately long break afterward?

So he gave me Clonidine .2mg, that im supposed to take 3 times a day. I paired this with Gabapentin 800mg, twice a day to help me sleep.  The first couple days were rough. Hot and Cold flashes, sweating, diarreah, nausea, headaches...  I had them all.

&#x200B;

I subscribed to this sub and found a few tips and tricks such as Caffeine being a no no, so i stopped drinking soda which helped alot with sleeping..

&#x200B;

I also tried Kratom Red Bali pills but those gave me really nasty side effects and crazy dreams after 1 dose. So i stopped this.

&#x200B;

After 6 days I have managed to wean myself down to a single morphine sulfate 30mg per 24 hours but cannot manage to stop it all together. Any tips with how to deal with Restless Leg Syndrome and the inability to sleep? I think if i could get something to deal with those two primary areas i think i could drop the Morphine all together. I just cant get a good nights rest without taking the Morphine right at bed time.",1548176146.0

He was found and supposedly dead for 5 hours before he was found. He was found with his 1 year old son in his dead arms all alone. The night before that his wife overdosed and was in the hospital at the time of him overdosing. The State has taken custody of his son and my family is fighting to get him back .He has overdosed dozens of times in the past year . I cant imagine what would have made him do this with his child in his arms. Did his son crawl to him after he used? Did he use in another room and make his way to the living room ? Did he struggle ? His Wife and that side of the family dont even have the money to cremate him never mind provide a memorial service for him they are trying to crowd fund it i guess. Im left feeling guilty , shocked, and slightly responsible for my lack of help I provided my cousin . Struggling with my own personal life issues and Depression I never even sat down to think about all the people like my cousin I have pushed away from my own life . 

As i'm sitting here crying listening to my cousins playlist that he created on Youtube. He was 26. A year ago he got married to a substance abuse counselor and had a baby last year. Lukas Graham's "" 7 Years "" is on his playlist. Not exactly something I would choose but got to admit its frighteningly horrifying to listen to in the present context.  The Lyrics must have resonated with my cousin the same way they are with me today because the rest of his playlist is all Rap music.  

"" 7 Years Old ?""  Me and my Cousin Grew up together. Sharing cribs, sharing toys , sharing birthdays as his his only 2 days apart from mine. We were a year apart but we might as well have been twins growing up .   
Both of our moms (sisters) were drug addicts. We have both been through the system ourselves . We both went through foster care and bounced around from house to house. Most of the time seeing the adults using drugs in front of us . It was normal for our moms , aunts and other family members to use and talk about hard drugs in front of us.  At about 7 years old was around the time we were split up due to our mothers drug use. I went to live with my father and he was adopted by a family friend. My cousin never had a chance in life with the cards he was dealt . I still seen him frequently but it wasn't the same for us as it was growing up. 

His new family took care of him but I never felt he was loved. His bed was in a hallway but he made the best of it. He was amazing at sports I remember always being jealous of how good he was whenever I went to his games. He never really found himself . Never went to college . Never kept a steady job . After school days never played any sports again . The last time I saw him was probably about 4 years ago . He came to my house to visit and meet my newly born daughter. I could tell he was in rough shape but we had a great week hanging out and vacationing together in Florida. I wish i could remember the last thing we talked about or the last thing we did but I cant. I am left with an overwhelming wave of guilt struck over me . Why didn't I call him? Why didn't I sign up for that stupid Facebook account so I could stay in touch ? Could I have helped him ? Why do I alienate everybody that doesn't fit my picture perfect cutout of what a person should be ? Did my cousin know how much I loved him and how much im proud of him ? Probably not . Call Your relatives . Call your family . Tell them you love them . Nothing is permanent . Everything is temporary . 

Cant help but Replay this same song now. "" Soon Ill be 60 years old "" . I wish you could have got to live to see your 60th Birthday Cuz. Maybe See your Sons 60th Birthday .  I wish I could have done something or at least told you how proud of you I was . Don't worry we will take care of your son and make sure he had a better chance at life then we did . I will stay in touch this time. Im sorry i didn't do more,  I love you . 

To anybody struggling with addiction please read this and know your family cares. Even a distant cousin that you haven't seen in a while. Your parents. Your neighbor . Somebody Cares. Theres always somebody that is willing to help you and pick you up off your feet. Life is tough it was never meant to be easy . Dont struggle all alone, Dont Die all alone. You deserve better. And please get help . I know this is the hardest thing you have ever done in your life but you can do this I promise, Get Help . 

TLDR

My Cousin Overdosed and was found with his 1 year old son in his dead arms . I'd do anything to talk to him right now. Appreciate your family while they are still there because someday they wont be and dont be scared to ask them for help . ",1548170065.0

I’ve recently started using black tar heroin as a way of self-medicating a chronic pain issue. Trust me, I know it’s not smart, but it’s all I’ve got right now. I’m just looking for advice on how to use as safely as possible. 

Initially I was smoking it, but couldn’t seem to master the art of Chasing the vapor, and since I felt like I was ultimately wasting a lot of product, I began making monkey water and using an oral syringe to snort it. I’ve also used the coin and baking powder trick to turn it into a powder a few times.

Since doing this, I have noticed a dramatic decrease in pain symptoms, but I’m worried that whatever cutting agents being used to produce the H are damaging my body/brain. Most noticeably, I’ve noticed some feelings of discomfort in my chest, as well as feelings of confusion, and I’ve even experienced an episode of shaking/heart racing once or twice. I also suffer from panic attacks so I can’t necessarily differentiate between my use/pre existing anxiety but it’s concerning nonetheless.

So I have a few questions: 

Are these symptoms a major cause of concern? Should I see a doctor? 

Also, heroin should dissolve in water, right? So would it be a good idea to dissolve it in water and filter out whatever insolubles remain? Would I be good to go then? Or should I follow the type of purification guideline that more extensively purifies BH (such as the one involving ammonia and ethyl?) it’s the insoluble shit that’s the bad stuff right? 

Or am I just getting bad dope? I should add that since I started using I’ve felt no euphoria...at least not the kind I used to get from orally consuming Oxys...

I know I’m asking a lot of questions but I’m honestly just looking for any advice or suggestions...I wanna treat my pain but I don’t wanna fuck up my brain/heart.

Thanks y’all ",1548150544.0

Yeah, right. Worked as much as the last time I did that. Spent the last few days getting sicker and sicker, going from 10 pills per dose to like 2/3! Dumbest taper ever, lol. Woke up this morning with a migraine and feeling sick to my stomach, but it was ok because I ordered another script yesterday and just needed to wait until the postman brought it. He just delivered, ate them within minutes and I think I'm high just off of the relief since they won't even have started breaking down yet. Hate this shit but you really can't beat that relief.

It's 'only' codeine pills for me, which I know is absolutely nothing to most of you guys. Been addicted and heavily using them for around 2yrs now, only opiate I have access to via prescription (GP and online). Tolerance has grown from 2 30mg pills as prescribed to 10 pills 3x a day, went through WD's once, RLS was the absolute worst!! Horrific, torturous feeling!

&#x200B;

The problem is, since I was on benzos when I hid the bag, I may or may not remember even hiding it, let alone remembering WHERE I hid it. Therefore, I see eating benzos as a sacrifice to Junkie Jesus because sometimes your5 sacrifices can result in you discovering some dope when you thought you were out! 

&#x200B;

Take today for example. I thought I was out of opiates, and I was beginning to get sick. I head over to my benzo stash in order to take some xanax and etizolam to ease the withdrawal, and what do you know! In the same stash spot, I find a half gram of dope in with the benzos. What a Junkie Jesus score that wouldn't have occurred If I can not eaten the benzos the day before, making a ""sacrifice"" to Junkie Jesus. I guess I stashed that D there the day before knowing that I'd eventually find it, most likely when I needed it most. 

&#x200B;

I don't know, I guess this is sort of a shitpost, but I thought it was a funny way to look at how we use benzos and hide/find stuff unexpectedly. Happy nods, my friends, and be safe! Always have narcan on hand and never hesitate to call 911 for any reason, if needed. 

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Eating benzos is a sacrifice to Junkie Jesus because it may result in you finding stuff you didn't know you had, or hid earlier and forgot about.

so I started taking Tilidin about three months ago (comparable to Vicodin but a lot weaker). Two months ago I started taking it daily, then about one month ago I switched to hydromorphone. I'm currently on about 6-12mg Dilaudid daily (oral/snorted). I'm kinda scared of wd but I definetly want to take a break. I think I'm not ready to live completely sober but I'm sick of being high every day. My question is if I can withdraw while having to work if I use some drugs that ease the wd or how bad it would be in general. In a week I also got a Friday off so I'd have three days to myself. 

What I have: 3 x 75mg and 5 x 150mg Pregabalin, 4 x 2mg Klonopin, 10 x 1mg Xanax, 2 x 8mg Buprenorphine
What is the most useful? I also still have opioids if tapering is an option, but I thought maybe it's better to just quit cold turkey since I didn't use for too long. Also I got some kratom but the smell and taste makes me wanna puke..

I was hesitant but ended up agreeing since mine was just collecting dust and his dope was the best I’ve found in a while. But when we made the exchange, the work he gave me wasn’t the same, I could tell it was different by looking at it but after trying some realized it was bunk. I got him up and said that I was expecting to get the same shit we always get, and he tells me he’ll make it right. So two days later and he says he got the good stuff again and gives me another gram. Obviously I was more skeptical this time but the color looked right and I figured if he was trying to rip me off he wouldn’t have gone thru the trouble of meeting me again. But after I try the shit I realize it’s just as bad as the first shit he gave me. Now he’s just ignoring me. Idk what to do, I know where he lives and who he gets his dope from tho

I have a slight tolerance due to codeine usage over the last 2 weeks, around 150-180mg produces a nice buzz.

My question is how do I take these and how much? Do I need to crush before swallow or what? And what dosage? I only have knowledge of instant release not extended release.

I have 4 pills so 40mg total and am looking to have a nice buzz on the beach haha.

Any advice is welcome since my only experience is with codeine and dihydrocodeine.

Literally. He doesn't want a woman. He doesn't care about a house or a car. He just about that thing, and has been for 10 years.

And when you get locked down, which one way or another will totally happen at some point, you can say, shit, I didn't want that white bread life anyway! Bad America!! We don't need no stinkin flatscreens!

Yeah, man, check out these bags of dope! And these pills - whoa, what a wet dream! You crave that shit and if you pull somebody else down with you, oops, my bad. Good thing there are no shortage of people cause I just messed that one up.

My mom confronted me today after she found my pills. And everything she said was right, I feel so bad now I can’t stop crying I broke her heart. She gave me all this and this is how I repay her...","So I come inside and my moms doing some cleaning. I say hi, and have a seat. 

She sits down besides me and tells me “I just want to talk to you normally. I promise I won’t be mad I just want to talk to my son. Just be honest and don’t yell at me.

So I say, “what now mom?”

She confronts me about some oxy she found, and then breaks down and says all this 

“Why do you need these ? What’s happening with you?  I’m your mother I’m here to help please tell Me. Anything you’re going through/ feeling you can tell me. 

Meanwhile I just keep acting like a asshole and yelling and denying it

She says “you think I don’t notice you wasting your young life away in these four walls at home all day? You think I don’t notice you nodding off at the dinner table? You’re my son I’m supposed to notice these things. You really think I don’t notice you staying in bed all day everyday ??? You think I don’t notice money missing from my purse? I just don’t say a word because in my mind I refuse to believe that you really did these things. In my head you’re still my innocent son. Please just talk to me what are you going through that’s making you use these ?”

It seems she has a a very good understanding that a addict usually goes through a lot of problems like depression/anxiety that lead them to use. She kept focusing on WHY/ WHAT FEELINGS drive me to use? Instead of just putting me down for using. I never expected this but she totally understands 


But then she broke my heart when she said this 

“Do you know that I cry myself to sleep every night? You don’t see how you’re slowly destroying yourself but you are. No mother wants to live to see her son/ daughter get to this level. I can see you’re hurting son. You stay inside all day with your eyes glued to your phone while all your cousins and associates you grew up with are out and about and thriving. Do you know how much I suffer because of this? What is the meaning of ME living anymore? I raised you and tried to set you up for success and seeing you struggling in life is killing me. I might as well not be here. Go ask your dad how I cry myself to sleep every night.”

.
Point is this woman READ me like a book. She knew everything. She mentioned noticing when I’m on it and how I act and everything from my voice changing while on it, to nodding, to me stealing etc. 

And most important she didn’t judge me, she instead wanted to know what’s going on with me mentally that’s causing me to do all this?



And what do I do? all I did was deny and say I was just selling them... 

And now I’m in my room curled up crying. Crying because I’ve caused this woman who gave me everything I ever wanted in life so much pain 


I don’t want to regret this in the future. When my parents are gone and I’m visiting their grave I don’t wanna look down and say I disappointed them. And caused them to suffer. 


Her words keep echoing in my head. She told me “you’ll never know how this feels till you have a kid yourself and they do the things you did”


And that’s when I realized it would kill me if my son did these same things. I’d be worried every second. I love you mom I totally get you






This needs to stop. I can’t keep doing this

You have given this broken down hopeless junkie a place to finally feel at home. A place where i can share my failures and successes and not feel judged. A place where everyday i learn something about others and their struggles, this sub is amazing. SOO idk why but i feel it's time to share this.


	I have been a long time lurker, but have become more active after my most recent stay in rehab. This was my third try that year to get clean and i was determined. I was ready to all i had to,  I was desperate just be be normal again. I did my 90 in 90 at one of the best treatment facilities i have EVER stepped foot in. They truly cared, all the counselors and staff had themselves been in the life. It was nice. 


	Now fast forward too two weeks after i came home… now this is something im still dealing with trying to understand things happen and recovery isn't perfect. However i knew. I FUCKING KNEW all along i was going to do this, so why leave a safe place where i had finally managed to get 90 days under my belt because...im an addict and that's what i do reckless shit. So needless to say it wasn't too long after coming home i found myself with a needle in my arm, and ever so swiftly swept right back into the life. Sad fucking truth here i loved it. It was everything that i missed. Fuck me right? So my use continued for about another week or so. Three bundles all together. 


	Well around the start of the new week i had gone to grab my shit, hurried home and fixed my shot, if you check my post history you can see the one im talking about… Anyways something fucking happened. I did my shot went to relax and i couldnt. For some fucking reason all my shame and guilt decided to hit me right then and there. I fucking broke. I got up and went to the mirror and there he was my full fucking blow addict self, How did i let this happen? Why did i let such a good thing go for what?! 10 fucking minutes of relife. In that moment i fucking hated myself. Like nothing i have ever felt before. I had to do something.


	I told myself i was done. Honestly and truthfully done. So i Cold turkeyed it. It sucked i had the flu on top of some pretty shitty Wd’s. But guess what mother fuckers i made it! Im 32 days clean right now with no subs or anything besides a little bit of green in the beginning. I can't really explain what's happened, maybe it’s for the first time in my life it was ME who made this choice to stop. No one else’s. No interventions, No jail, Just me saying enough is a fucking nough. Today i am sober, Today i feel good. And that’s all i can ask for.

Ill keep you all posted on how things go from here on out.

Legal Guantanamo for Minors+ my current situation,"Someone requested this (kinda) so here it is.


Drug abuse. Something that has followed me for most of my life. But this is all before my wreck at age 17 that made it to where I needed pain pills for real for real.



I’ve been using drugs since I was about 11ish. Took my first perc at age 10 for an injury. Then at 11 i was abusing my Focalin Script by doing 3 at a time. I didn’t really know what i was doing, I just knew it felt better than I usually felt. At 12 I hit my first joint. By 13 I was smoking weed everyday.



At 14 I was copping big 300 count bottles of .25 Xanax that my gma (who is now dead) used to get every 3 months from Hospice but she’d never use but like 50 a month so I’d take the remainder at the end of the 3 month period. I was eating them like candy and selling them. Also at 14 I took my first Lortab and smoked opium.


At 15 I was taking Tabs, xanax, and any other pain pill I could get my hands on. I also tried my first OC (the last year you could get them before the dreaded OP formula change). At this point, I was smoking weed and taking molly DAILY and didn’t give a fuck if my family knew or not. 



At 16, after using every hallucinogen possible including RCs I was ordering myself, my mom got to the mail before I did. She came home early from work.... in there was 4gs of 3-MeO-PCP and that was the final straw. The next week, She got me in the car about Noon (I had eaten Shrooms I had picked myself about 3 am so I was coming down), told me we’re going out to eat in a big town an hour away, we went on this back road and BOOM! Our car gets stormed by these people that worked for the Youth Boot Camp, mom had set me up, and they were yanking me out of the car, and dragged me onto this side dirt road that led straight into the Boot camp. 


I was there for 6 months. Psychological torture and manipulation was their main game, physical labor and constant exhaustion to weaken the spirit. I was constantly suicidal.


They would tell me my family didn’t love me, that my girlfriend at the time had sent me a break up letter telling me she hated being with a druggie (I knew that was a lie because she used weed and molly with me every day), that my dog had died, and just reminded me that I was a horrible person.


They took my letters, made sure I didn’t say anything like “this place is making me suicidal!” Or “please come get me. I don’t think I can make it.” Or anything that asked about the outside world or anything that they deemed to be “not up to standard”. They would redact my family’s letters to make sure I didn’t know anything that would bring me any type of joy.


I wasn’t going to make it.



I kept these poisonous berries that grow in my state in my pocket the whole time I was there. 1 to go to the hospital, 2 for death in a day, 4 is death in an hour. I never used them but you see how far they pushed kids from 12-18. Pure unadulterated torture masked in fake letters written to our parents of our “progress”. I have diagnosed PTSD, MPD, and MDD because of that place.... 


Finally, my mom came and picked me up after 6 months. Only thing that place gave me besides a ton of mental illnesses, was the ability to lie and hide with the absolute best con artists. 


So I was back home, age 17 now, using weed to mask my depression and suicidal thoughts. I stayed away from most drugs for a little while.


Well, then I had my car wreck. I had been back about 10 months. My buddy(driving) and I were going to pick up a friend from a party. I had taken a 5-MeO-DMT chocolate. We ran off the road. I wasn’t wearing a seatbelt. I ended up almost being ejected from the car. The doctor said the only reason I survived was that my body was like silly putty because I was tripping so hard. I was prescribed perc 10s. 


That was the beginning of my long road of opioid dependence.


After the script ran out, I was still in pain. I have 2 herniated discs and a pinched nerve in my neck, one HD in my back, and a broken rib that wasn’t healing as well as I’d have liked. I was 17, no doctor would treat me.


My buddy brought over a 30mg Roxy. He knew I was in terrible pain. I liked them, So he had told this kid that sold him this one that they were worth 3 a p and got the kid to steal his dad’s script. We bought 90 30s for $270. I had finally capture the relief I had been begging for.



Fast forward all these years later, the blue handcuffs are still on me. I’ve been treated here and there for my chronic pain but even now as a 24 year old, docs will treat me for 3 months, then drop me due to my age. 


I don’t know how to end this exactly but with this.



I pray that one day, I will be able to be treated as the patient in pain that I am rather than them see me as an overweight 24 year old that “just needs to exercise the pain away”.  Maybe one day. As I’m typing now, my neck won’t fucking stop stabbing and my lower back is tightening up. I was dope sick till about an hour ago. But it’ll soon return.

Rn my oral tolerance is at 90-100mg.. if I had one 30 for example, if I ate that one it wouldn’t do shit. But if I snorted it, I’d atleast feel something. 

But I also know it’s duration is shorter.

1. My friend who is on probation said the last 2 times he was drug tested there was nobody in their watching him piss. He said they have stopped having a person in their to observe the drug test. Do you guys think that if they stopped doing this for probation drug tests they would stop doing it for the drug tests at court? If there is no observer I can simply use fake urine like I've used for jobs. My friends have used it before with an observer in the room and the urirne itself works, but I don't have the balls to do this with somebody in the room if you get caught doing this you go straight to jail, and get extra charges.

2. Does kratom show up on a drug test? I could stay on kratom for a week or 10-14 days before court instead of doing H if It would keep me clean on a drug screen. 


3. Does anybody have any recommendations on how to beat a court drug test?

I am a 30 year old girl and I have serious problems in social relationships, attention, concentration and motivation starting from childhood.

When I use opiates (Oxy, Hydro, Codeine, H, etc.) I become even more introverted, less motivated and I do not feel any gratification.

I know that the most reliable hypothesis about autism states that the endogenous opioid system is autonomically overstimulated. This would explain not perceiving the high when I take opioids.

On the other hand, I have a serious addiction to stimulants.

I have experience with a couple of opiates but due to my responsible use I have zero opiate tolerance. I use a couple times a year (2-4 times) for about a week.

Thus far I always crushed my pills for an immediate-release effect. I consumed heroin freebase, sourced on DNMs and definitely very good stuff, by vaporizing it in a meth pipe. As a non-tolerant, oxycodone dosages of 20-40mg were consumed.

Now, I have the chance to acquire a 32mg hydromorphone tablet, intended for a once-a-day schedule. I'm interested in taking this formula as intended, as I'm well aware that 32mg IR would be waaay too much. I'm not 100% sure, though, if it is an appropriate dosage. Considering it spread across the day I would assume so, but I'm looking for someone more experienced to comment on this.

Nobody can. It is beyond a heavy burden to say the least and the only way to lighten the baggage is by snorting that line, popping pills and smoking weed on top of everything else. 

Talking helps as well but to lay loads of this shit on my family and friends doesn't work. Its awkward because nobody I know is versed in chronic pain and the fun fucking shit storm that's included. I see a therapist but not nearly enough due to scheduling issues. 

So on goes this cycle of massive anxiety, which turns into crippling depression resulting in my lack of interest in most things. How can I fully enjoy getting into any long term commitments when I dont see myself living more than 5 more years. 

I know it's a grim outlook but fuck man, pain is more than debilitating. I'm in a weird limbo. I dont want to die necessarily. But the physical turmoil turns a sunny day into a hurricane. There are moments in life I live for but for the most part, they are far and few between.

Not entirely opiate related but I figured if any sub could appreciate this one it would be you guys. 

This all started 5 years ago when i was only 17 years old. I was new to opiates and was just discovering the wonderful world of oxy. Along with this, my friends and I were just old enough to start throwing parties and one of my friends in particular lived in a mansion and had a mother who liked to travel. Lucky us. 

Well both this kids parents were lawyers and he was the type of dude to un-ironically wear “salmon” colored short shorts and golf every weekend with his dad and whenever people got in his face he’d threaten to sue them. (Shit you not). 

As you can imagine, this combined with the fact that there were enough pills lying around this house to start a fucking pharmacy it didn’t end well. 

One weekend, word got around that this kid (we’ll call him “James”) was throwing a party. I wasn’t too fond of him but I sure loved his hot tub so I called up my best bud “Stu” and we headed over. 

We enter this house and it’s a fucking zoo. Imagine the OG days when every rich suburban white kid popped OC 80’s and or did pharmacy grade xans and imagine there’s 100+ of these people packed into one house and a good 80% of them are girls. 

Before I can even process the fucking chaos that is ensuing “James” immediately grabs my homie “stu” and pulls him upstairs while accompanied by three girls. I go to the living room and see a shit ton of people in the pool out back and piles of pills all over the counter seemingly free for the taking. 

I pop a few oxy to calm my nerves and start talking to this girl I had a thing with who was at the party but before i can make a move I see James and Stu burst into the living room. James immediately runs up to me and puts his arm around me and yells loudly into my ear “dude holy shit, Stu is a god damn animal!! This motherfucker just popped a hulk and did three lines!” 

Keep in mind, my boy Stu up to this point has never even smoked weed before. I only brought him with me because he’s my best friend and he’d never been to a party. I break free of James and grab Stu by the shoulders, I look right into his fucking eyes and ask why the fuck he did that and he looks at me, pupils dilated and hands shaking and replies “you think even I fucking know”. 

At this point I realize that there’s no point in trying to do any sort of damage control, this situation is volatile and I can either embrace the chaos or leave . The oxy is starting to kick in at this point too so i say fuck it, Stu can handle himself I’m gonna have fun. 

I make my moves on the girl i was originally talking too and after we were done fucking in a spare bedroom she goes over to her pants and pulls out a little baggy full of adderall and k pins. 

She offers me some and I quickly take her up on the addy because at his point in time I’d done it quite a bit and loved it, especially when combined with oxy. 
She starts whining about how I needed to try the k pins with her too but see at this time, I knew next to nothing about benzos and was even scared to try them. 

Butttt, being the impressionable teenager i was, all it took was about ten minutes for this girl to talk me into taking the k pins along with the addy and next thing i know I’m stuck at this house for the next two fucking days. Keep in mind I probably popped like four of these k pins (no idea the dose) 

I don’t know how much I did after that or how many times I redosed but from here onwards my memory is like a slideshow. Her and I go downstairs and we socialize for a while but before I can tell if I’m feeling anything yet I’ve “teleported” back into the upstairs bedroom. 

Only problem is the girl is no longer with me and I’m completely fucking naked with James and Stu next to me completely naked too and we each are holding a white bedsheet and scissors cutting them up like we’re in some fucking nudist arts club. 
I didn’t even question this shit! I just ended up there and as far as I was concerned at the time, that’s what was happening and there wasn’t a damn thing out of place... 

Before I can even wrap my head around this were somehow running around James house wearing nothing but the bedsheets like some makeshift togas while groping girls as we run past. At this point I am no longer the controller in my body I’m merely a passenger. There was no A to B. Everything was happening in fragments with no beginning or end and i don’t remember anything in between these moments. 

I then vaguely recall riding in a golf cart (James house was on a golf course and he had his own golf cart) while James drove and mind you, we are still wearing the damn togas and it’s gotta be the middle of the night. My boy Stu, high for the first time in his life on god knows what is screaming “allah akbar” at the top of his lungs for no reason other than the fact that at this point were most likely delirious and all the stimulants in our system won’t allow the benzos to hit the off button for anything but our judgement so we’re just stuck in this timeless purgatory of bad decisions. 

Next thing I know we’re back at the house in James hot tub. STILL WEARING these fucking togas. Now normally I’d start to panic because I keep “teleporting” and I have no recollection of what’s happening between each memory but I was more calm than I’d ever been in my life and before I can even enjoy being in the hot tub I am driving my fucking car with Stu in the passenger seat.

This is where I start to come too a little bit and things become a bit more lucid. I remember pulling up his house at like 4 in the morning and I watch him walk down to his house, open the front door, stare inside and then slam the door with the strength of almighty god and walk back up to my car. 

He then says “the doors locked, I’m gonna go through the window”. I’m lucid enough to remember what happened pretty clearly at this point but not enough to where I’m able to question his logic so I just nod in encouragement as we walks back down to his house. 
He opens the window by his living room and stumbles inside knocking over his TV. I see all the lights come on in his house so i peel out of there. 


I’m too ashamed to go back home so I pull up to James house since the dude only lived five minutes away from Stu. I go inside and just pass out. 

I wake up the next day and you guessed it, I’m still wearing this fucking toga I’d made and it’s soaking wet because I wore it in the hot tub. The house is trashed beyond repair and everybody except James is gone at this point. 

I can’t find my phone but thank god my keys were right next to the bed so I change out of the toga into some  of James clothes that were in the closet and head over to my car. 

It’s covered in fucking mud and has a massive dent on the side of it. On top of that, I get home and check Facebook and find out my boy Stu got grounded because apparently he woke his parents up when he broke into his own house and was too gone to even explain himself. I’m covered in bruises and scratches, my car is fucked, my phone and clothes are gone and it’s a fucking Sunday. Mind you I had gone to the house Friday night.... 

Moral of the story is, amphetamine and benzos are a scary fucking combo. I went on to do many drugs before my recovery but after that experience I always stayed far away from benzos..... as for Stu, after that weekend he decided to stick with weed.

ai5xsk,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/ai5xsk/my_first_taste/,10,https://redd.it/ai5xsk,Waiting_on_a_Corner,My First Taste,"I was a clumsy kid, jumping into every reckless and fun opportunity that was presented to me. By the time I was 17 I had broken over ten bones, all of which were from doing something dumb. Every time I went in I got some sort of opiate, Morphine would drip slowly into my IV one drop of bliss at a time. Play up the pain for that sweet bliss was what I learned from uncountable hospital trips. I learned how to perfect my look of desperation, gritting my teeth, through short gasping breaths I asked ""please, please make it stop hurting so bad"". Doctors back then weren't being harassed about them prescribing opiates, and so I always left with a 30 day supply of Vicodin or Percocet. My mother dolled them out one at a time and my broken bones didn't feel broken anymore.


I will always remember my first morphine drip, I was at the Sierra Nevada hospital. I had broken my left collarbone and shattered my wrist to pieces ditching into the rocks to avoid an oblivious family. A quick “Oh Shit” was the last thing I said before spacetime slowed. 


I leaned to the left and braced, as my board stopped on a rock. The brown weeds looked so odd growing from the ground, as I spun in the air. Then pain, sharp and stabbing cut into my left wrist as the ground hit me. For a brief moment I was in an empty void, devoid of light, sound, pleasure or pain.


‘did I…?’ escapes my mouth into the void…


Reality tears me from the emptiness before I could comprehend it. As I tore through each layer of my consciousness pain greets me first. Hot blades leave every nerve ending in my left shoulder in intractable agony, as I remember breathing is also essential to life. Opening my eyes I saw long dead weeds and a boulder that I think I missed? Wiggle my toes, wiggle my fingers, I work my way up my mental checklist. My best friend Mik runs to me yelling “Dude! Are you ok?!”. I struggle to sit up, ‘my left side doesn't feel right…’ Mik helps me to a nearby tree and calls my mom to take me to the hospital. Longboarding with my Mik was our lives, every day. 


The hospital staff treated me well, not like they would if they saw the road ahead of me. After an X Ray, 2 Percocet, and an uncomfortable, shirtless, 4 hour wait, I complained about the pain in my well trained ways. The doctor after seeing shattered pieces where my collar bone used to be and a broken wrist gave me mercy.


Another clear bag appeared on my IV tree, small but with great power. The moment the drips of Icor entered my veins everything became warm, like a heat lamp on my perception. My mother and a nurse asked if I was ok and boy was I OK. They began talking about options, but I was long gone, lost in bliss




Normal people would not remember this experience with fondness but, because of Morphine I still hold on to the memory. Mik and I crashed on our longboards all the time but somehow he never got hurt and I always did. Road-rash, ripped jeans, torn shirts, and shoes with one sole almost completely gone, were part of my daily life. I loved this life thoroughly, the thrill of doing 30-50 miles per hour was truly unparalleled. The wind passing over me, forced pure adrenaline and endorphins to flood my brain. Everything was so surreal, like the world got brighter, my world was quiet after a few hours of skating. All my frustration, problems, and fears were dampened after doing 30 miles per hour with cars passing by 2 feet away. After taking a blind corner or running a light, I wasn't afraid of death, I feared nothing.



But alas I was still a teenager, and though I didn't fear death, I did fear the girls my age. I was a tall gangly kid, 6’1”, 140 pounds, and my mom still bought my clothes. I was not popular, I hung out with the druggies at school, and at home I hung out with Mik and his older brother Shaw. Mik and Shaw were Mormon and I still went to church so growing up we became best friends fast. We however were not on the same path, they stayed on the straight and narrow, and mine began to curve away. 


It all began on the second Saturday of the month, the church had youth dances in our building every month. So as with every church dance Mik an I showed up, jeans, button ups, and ratty skate shoes. We could have been twins but my body shown radiant with opiate power.


Right before I left I was looking for some Tylenol for a headache, and lo and behold, I found 4 Hydrocodone and Acetaminophen 5/500mg. 


“Close enough” I said, as I emptied the bottle into my mouth and swallowed all the pills.


‘What's the worst that could happen?’


I felt amazing. My body reverberated with energy, my mind fed off this energy. I buzzed electric though the crowd, my shy teenage awkwardness became pure unbridled confidence. Every slow song I was charisma machine, double entendres, had every girl hiding their blushing faces. At the end of the night Mik and I spot a 20/20, two best friends both 10/10 gorgeous. Mik ogled both of them as I stared at a tall woman in heels, tight jeans, a black tight top, and shoulder length, curled blonde hair. Your Guardian Angel begins, as the last dance of the night is announced. Mik turned to ask what our play was, but I was already on a mission. Standing up straight, walking with a clear, purpose I walk up to the blonde. Touching her hand she turned to me, I asked her for this dance, and we proceeded to walk to the back of the gym.



As my opiate fueled charisma put words and euphemisms together fluently, time slows in my mind. I feel warmth floating around me, I was alone but oh so comfortable, something else was driving my body. Some charismatic mask that had me dancing with a supermodel looking girl, making new friends, even dancing… All while I was able to stay in the pleasure of my own mind. 


‘I wish I could feel like this all the time’ I think to myself and return to the hot girl and conversation going on in front of me


By the end of the dance Mik and I had convinced the 20/20s to go to Taco Bell with some friends. Usually I would be ecstatic to be in this position but I was starting to feel cold. Insecurities spread throughout my body like cancer as my chances of getting more than a phone number from Chelsea evaporated.. 


My first high faded just like the texts sent between Chelsea and I over the next week. But damn I wonder if there any more leftovers in the medicine cabinet...

Obviously the withdrawal is fucking hell. Haven’t slept at all, restless as fuck, sweating, puking out of both ends, whole 9 yards. For some reason it feels bearable though because I know that what I need to get well is right here.

Obviously this wouldn’t work for everybody, and it certainly wouldn’t work if you were trying to quit permanently. If you’re just trying to take a break though, maybe think about if something like this psychological comfort shit would help you.",1548039957.0

Colour: Crayola Gray, pink tint. 
Texture: Powdered, to small rocks

 A long time runner and I copped boy today off Dude we just met. I donated $60 to his cause to which I got a big as a gift in return weighing 1.63 in the sack on the scale. Cool, cool, I smell it. Let's go. Once, arriving back at base I open the gift ... but ... it's not tar to my surprise. 
  
 I empty the contents out onto our scale to get a better look whilst my partner grabs a slice of the cake and begins to chase some reptile down a chrome looking surface street to which I thought ""buuuutt ... this is powder, possibly ecp. Whatever, let him try to smoke it"" The colour is almost plain gray. Take a ""gray"" Crayola marker and slight pink tint, that's the hue. 

 Mistake. He ran a point within 3 minutes by himself while I had went shit, returned, to find him nodding off holding a two inch trail on chrome road, odd. As I'm waking him up he snaps to, gasps for air and then procdeeded to chug some caffiene to wake himself up quickly all while he's says, in paraphrase, ""bro, it's surely fent, grab the tests, it's gotta be fent. I'm tripping, bro, I was NOT breathing, thank you but seriously, *idgafsolid, get the tests, nigga!"" God damn ... 

 For the testing an entire half point was dissolved into 1ml of water, mixed well, and then tested with two strips. Both came back positive for fentanyl or analogues not limited to but including: Fentanyl, Butyryl-fentanyl, Tetrahydrofuran fentanyl, Acrylfentanyl, Cyclopropylfentanyl, Acetylfentanyl, 3-Methylfentanyl, Carfentanil, Sufentanil, β-OH-thiofentanyl, Furanylfentanyl, p-Flourofentanyl, Flouroisobutyryfentanyl, etc. (Source Linked @ Top)

It's odd to see any powder form in my location. Anyone around here will tell you that. West of the Mississippi is always tar. Therefor I am assuming this is gunpowder cut with some F. The main reason I believe there is still gunpowderis because it tastes, smells, and runs per usual yet it is also powdered and rocky if need be although we can't breath it back into tar. Thoughts?

Lately I've been doing heroin for a few days every two weeks, then feeling like shit for a few days before getting paid and starting the cycle again. This last time around I pushed it as far as I could go, and ended up using nearly the whole 2 weeks. Last night I got me hands on some meth, I wasn't really feeling that bad. Yesterday was day 2, this is day 3. I decided to get as fucked up on the meth as possible, to try to alleviate the boredom and restlessness from minor opiate withdrawal.

It worked at first, and then I felt heroin withdrawal smack me in the fucking face. Eyes and nose pouring,skin crawling sweating, everything but diarrhea (I took 30 loperamide pills yesterday). I'm also feeling pretty cracked out from the meth, I live with people and I've been hiding in my dark room all day long, I'm terrified to go out and talk to anyone, and the freezing hot sweating gooseflesh is keeping me under my sweaty covers.

so i tried this a few months back i stopped heroin and took 3 doses of decreasing methadone a day 50mg,40,30. 

thought i was in the clear as 4 days after my last dose i  was still fine.  but on day 5 i started feeling it creep on.

i chalked it up to just the fatigue i would expect to feel but it just got worse and i needed to work so i hopped back on.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

this time i have  Gabapentin 300mg to hopfully stop the rls which is the part that most makes me relapse. i do also have some meth. as once before in withdrawal i did some speed paste, although it made turn into a poo cannon i was able to work and it helped with the rls.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

so this is where i am now, 

stopped heroin and took 30mg methadone 

next day i think i probably took around the same possibly slightly lower 

again next day the same and slightly lower

next day i decided to finish off the rest around 10-15mg 

that was thursday

so Friday i got ahold of some meth and tested out a low dose as it was my first time trying meth

i have adhd so stimulants affect me weirdly they make me very calm i almost nod if im sitting still and a nice body high

so with this discovery that meth was felt like a stimulant version of heroin it may come in handy.

Saturday i also tried out  Gabapentin  for the first time taking 300mg every 30 mins up to 1500mg.

i have alot of back pain  and some leg pain and it went away as the dose hit. this gives me hope it will work when/if the withdrawal hits.

&#x200B;

so i smoked meth on Saturday, quite alot but it only made me calmer and calmer but still a very active brain.

now this meth works fine with other people so i know its not bunk. its just me thats broken.

&#x200B;

went to bed around 4am Sunday after smoking meth  all day/night trying to get this high that everyone was talking about that never happend. so i get around 2-4  hours sleep, im a very light sleeper so any noise i wake up so it was a bit patchy 

&#x200B;

could feel the stim withdrawal on sunday when  i got out of bed around 11. so decided to do another round of gaba but a bit higher of a dose and more fatty meals in  between when that hit all pain went away again and i had nice mild high .

&#x200B;

that takes us up to here, Sunday night im expecting to feel withdrawal tomorrow from the methadone if not Tuesday

i will be at work for this with gaba and meth handy in case i need it. i really only want to use the gaba as i can deal with  the rest of the symptoms apart from the rls.

&#x200B;

so i guess sorry for the speil but what do you think is it a good plan. i should also mention this is the first time in years that i haven't once thought or dreamt of heroin when i was off it. i really feel like this is my chance.

usually i would dreaming about heroin and it would consume my thoughts all day. im ready to be done

Muted hearing and ringing ears a few minutes after shooting normal amount of dope. Hot spot maybe? Help?,"Hey guys. At about 7pm last night I did 60mg of dope and 20mg of ice in a shot. Was good, went well. I've been trying to taper a bit and lower my tolerance so I didn't do much. I smoked a couple points or so of meth for the next several hours and at 8am I do another shot with the exact same dosagesbas before. Except this time, after a few minutes, I come out of a nod laying down with extremely muted hearing and this super loud ringing in my ears. My boyfriend was trying to talk to me, but it feels like everything was underwater, I couldn't move in any coordinated way and it took several minutes for my hearing to go back to normal. I know it wasn't a bell ringer because I had the exact same shot earlier and there was a minimal amount of ice. It was absolutely terrifying though because it felt the same as when I ODed on fent. It was like everything was underwater, numb, can't hear, high ringing, really out of it, confused, etc. But this happened about 3-7 minutes after I hit the shot. When I overdosed on fent, it was within 30 seconds that I lost consciousness, and after a second time waking up like that, I needed narcan. Anyone experience this before? Know what it was? It wasn't a panic attack, because I've had several of those. I really felt exactly like my OD before I was out for good. Had my bf not been there, I would have probably needed narcan or woken up in my vomit. But maybe it wasn't a minor OD. Any advice or help? Hot spot? I want to do everything I can to avoid another experience like that. My bf was also superrrr fucked up from a similar small amount. It was already crazy strong, but I don't know why there would be a delay in such a strong response before gradually going away. Thanks guys. ",1548009475.0

This decision almost a month later has really put things into perspective for me and although not perfect, i am getting better and better every day.

now, me being the junk box i am, also addicted to benzos, i had to take a piss test upon arriving to first doc appointment and of course benzos popped up right away. Now this office was pretty busy that saturday at noon, filled with people like myself yearning to get there refills written, which left me with only a few minutes to speak to the doctor.

it is important for me to add at the time i was not physically addicted to benzos. The doctor basically said without asking me ""alright so we're gonna taper you for about 8-16 weeks blah blah blah heres 14 klonopin take 1 mg a day see you next week"". i was more than happy to accept this kind gift without saying much else. 

fast forward to a week later, yesterday, i tried getting him to up the dose, due to 1mg a day really not doing much for me at all, ""explaining"" i was taking 6-8mg of xanax daily the klonopin dosage he gave to me was a significant jump from that, extreme insomnia (which really is true), and a few extra little things in there to make it sound better. unfortunately he kept the dose where it was at saying ""the worst of the negative side effects should be over"" (below will also explain other important factors in why he didnt)

now this doctor is a solid dude, ive read/heard good things about him in terms of how his practice works and his goal is to get patients on and off subs quick as possible.

THIS IS WHERE IT GETS IMPORTANT: He is a physician and legally cant prescribe benzos unless its for tapering purposes. im almost positive he knew i wasnt physically dependant and just understood it is a difficult habit to just break. so i asked him if he could refer me to any psychs, which it turns out i have to do myself within my reach of insurance. Doc told me i can find a psych tell him im on klonopin or whatever benzo i get on in the next ""taper"" phase as well as suboxone and very easily get a benzo script because he already has me on them, saying he has many many patients in similar situations. benzos are the only thing that work for my crippling anxiety and negative chatter in my head, as well as greatly improve the quality of my life currently. is what the doctor telling me true? could i walk up into a psych and say i am seeing doctor x and i am on suboxone as well as klonopin but legally due to him being a physician cant stay on the klonopin with him and am currently tapering, and manage to get a script easy as that? if anyone has any feedback on being prescribed suboxone and benzos it would be greatly appreciated please because i really want to get this right. sorry if this is a little tricky to follow but yea any feedback would be greatly appreciated. 

&#x200B;

TLDR: Suboxone doctor has me on benzo taper 8-16 weeks, i want to stay on benzos. Doc told me he cant up the dose im taking now due to legal reasons and him being a sub doc/physician. Told me i can go to psych, be completely honest saying i am on suboxone and klonopin and that the sub doctor cant steadily keep me on benzos, i will of course explain the real benefits benzos do for my life and how they help me with my fucked brain chemistry, but is it really as easy as he says it is? or do i need to go to a psych and play my cards right by not directly asking for a klonopin/benzo script. i dont want to come off drug seeking i just dont want to waste time and want the medication that i know helps me where i lack regularly.

Alot if ppl save up their filters myself included and use them for a rainy day. The problem is alot of people in the States don't have proper needle exchanges and can't get the proper equipment . Water amps ,citric acid for #3 heroin ,disposable spoons , NON COTTON FILTER supplied with the spoon packet , alcohol swabs and syringes of various sizes ours also come with a built in micro filter in the cap and filter your shit much better than a regular filter there's a noticeable difference between the two. 
A dirty hit aka cotton fever us caused by a certain bacteria that grows on organic cotton . Once injected you start feeling like shit hit & cold flushes ,vomit, uncontrollable shaking  etc etc a bad day all round . Some folk say having a proper hit takes it away but I don't know personally as I've never had cotton fever . I've seen people with it and they look terrible and shake quite alot once they had another hit with powdered heroin. the symptoms seemed to die down . 

   Use a regular cigarette filter just a small piece and don't use flavoured cigs as they contain chemicals in the filter or little balls you crush to release the flavour . Cig filters are made from PLASTIC (Cellulose Acetate) and not cotton!! So dramatically decreases your risk of cotton fever since your not using cotton problem solved ! It's best to use rolling tobbaco filters as they come in a bag or box individually and your local shop should have them .1 or 2 bucks for a couple of hundred . I know zig zag make them but I'm not sure in the states as I don't think hand rolling tobbaco is as popular compaired to the UK . Just half the filter long ways and put it in you heroin mix and filter . I normally leave a few units on it and put it somewhere it will dry out quite fast then save up 3/4 of them and you get a pretty nice hit as each one has about 5/10 units in it plus what ever else. Try to dry them out as fast as possible to minimise the risk of any bacteria growing on them and store in a cool dark place or better yet your fridge or freezer if you can . ",1547996590.0

Although I had my first dose (10mg) at 23:00 last night (due to psychotic episode).

I had another one 8-9 hours later (this morning at 08:00).

So currently there's 20mg of Abilify in me with baseline tolerance.

Abilify is CNS depressant like benzodiazepines or alco. 

I took 60mg of codeine an hour ago to test my reaction whilst on Abilify, I feel more sedated than I would normally without an antipsychotic in me. 

I want to take a good amount of Dihydrocodeine soon (couple hours) (either 120mg, 150mg or 180mg max)

I'm hoping to feel the full effects of DHC.

Am I at risk of anything?

Any help will be useful.

Oxycontin was the culprit. Narcan saved me. Please read and save yourself as this is not your typical story!!,"This is an unfortunately too common topic these days. But after I experienced my opioid pain medication overdose and flatlined multiple times, was revived with two intramuscular injections of Nar**n from first responders, and realized I am in fact a mere mortal.... I had extreme PTSD and thought I could possibly turn to the World Wide Web and find lots of stories of similar experience to commiserate with. Well, I was extremely disappointed. As common as this epidemic is, there are many rehab/intervention ads available when you google the subject. But not enough real-life experiences being shared. So, I decided to share mine from start to finish. Because it is not a “typical” one (not that any are)... But I want to help anyone who may have experienced an accidental overdose and are left with questions about the experience and post trauma. Here is my story:

I am a generally healthy, 30 year old female residing in Southern California. I am very fit and active, I am successful in a fast-paced career field, and maintain a healthy long-term relationship. Doesn’t sound that odd, does it? Well it isn’t... Besides the fact that I was diagnosed with severe ulcerative colitis when I was in my early 20’s In 2008. For those who do not know, it is an Acute, autoimmune disease I will unfortunately have for life. Back in my diagnosis time frame... (I’m cutting the story very short)... The doctors would treat me with short term anti inflammatories to elucidate some of my symptoms. And for the painful symptoms that persisted and prevented this young, early twenty something woman from living a normal life, they prescribed me Vico**n to mask the basic pain so I could lead a somewhat normal life. Well, after a month or so at first on the Vic’s, my colitis went Into remission. I was able to discontinue the pain meds and return to a “normal” life. 

Fast forward 5 years. Suddenly my ulcerative colitis returns with a vengeance. (This disease does that unannounced.) after another colonoscopy I am treated very similarly to the first severe flare. Anti inflammatories for my colon and narcotic pain meds to help me get through daily life. This time they were No**o 10/325’s (the yellows). This is the first time I realized I liked the way they made me feel other than just for pain relief. They made my work days go by faster. My attitude with people was more cheery in general. My tolerance for things that would have otherwise agitated me was much higher. When I again went into remission, I kicked the pain meds once more, but this time I found it quite a bit more difficult. 

Fast forward again. (1 1/2 years ago to be more specific). Colitis returns. Same regimen. Colonoscopy, anti inflammatories, No**co. However, this time I’m under extreme stress in my personal life. I find myself taking more and more the recommended dose of my pain meds and requesting earlier and earlier refills. My doctors catch on, I get cut down, and ultimately cut off completely. By this time my body is completely dependent on No**co. At this point I was up to 12 10/325’s per day. Let me say also, that I am 5’7” and 116lbs (small). My tolerance is now through the roof. I begin buying them on the street and spending thousands of dollars on them. I’ll do anything to keep those withdrawals at bay. My mind and body are obsessed. I need them to function. My tolerance keeps growing. I eventually find a connect who tells me I need stronger pills. Ox**ntin 
 that have more of the opioid and less of the acetaminophen that damages your liver and organs so much. 

So begins that dragon which latches onto my back. I graduate from blowing through a monthly script of 90 10/325 No**os to snorting almost 10 blue 30mg Oxy’s per day. Obviously my body nor my wallet could support this ridiculous habit anymore. I know I need to get off the pills. This is uncommon, especially for my size and weight and the amount of pills i was consuming daily.... But I went through an at-home 7 day detox with the help of a close family member. It was Hell. I was sure I would die. But I did it. I dealt with about a month of post acute  withdrawal symptoms... Such as constant goosebumps, cold sweats, and runny nose, etc. It was not fun but I got through that and at about a month and some change I was free. No cravings for the pills. Energy levels back up. Mental clarity back. Feeling myself for the first time in almost 2 years. 

Fast forward to two weeks ago. If you are reading this as an addict, you know that even if you think you don’t want those drugs or pills anymore, if someone puts one in front of you, you think: “Ahhhh. I’ve been clean 6 months. One dose and a little high isn’t going to put me back into being a full blown addict.” And for some, this is correct. They can relapse once, twice, or a few times and that’s it. Others eat thrown right back down the rabbit hole into the throws of full on addiction again to have to go through the whole awful detox/clean process again. Agony. Anyways, I fall into the: “I’ll just do one for fun because it’s been six months and I have control of this thing.” Well.... I went from ingesting  10-12 30mg blue Ox’s per day in the peak of my habit... To having 1/2 of the same pill, ingested the same way as always (snorting), so yes, that’s only 15mg of Oxy... Literally making me overdose and sending me into respiratory arrest and killing me for about a minute and a half before my heart was shocked back to beating. So, what did merely half of a tablet of the usual stuff I could have previously snorted 10-12 of per day with no incident cause this near death experience? I will begin by saying that no, these pills were not counterfeit or laced with Fen**nyl. They were the real deal. This is what happened:

My boyfriend (a veteran of the US Air Force, only 31 years old himself) and I decided to get sushi and have our normal shared bottle of Saki and beer. We had a very pleasant evening, caught a slight buzz, and headed home. Upon getting home, I hadn’t eaten as much as I normally would have and I was feeling quite buzzed. In my altered state of mind I had a bit of a headache so I took a couple ibuprofen. I take 20mg Lexapro in the evening for the last 6 years for anxiety. I took my usual tablet. This is where it gets foggy:
My boyfriend and I were lying in bed and talking and laughing and enjoying each other’s company. (I remember this clearly.) I generally have trouble sleeping so I decided to take some Amitryptalyne to help my sleep. It is typically safe. In my alcohol induced mind I took 2 tablets instead of one. I vaguely remember quietly shuffling off to snort one last half blue 30mg Oxy pill I still had hanging around. I thought maybe I would get a great night’s sleep. Well, I got the kind I never imagined could even happen to me.

My last memory of the earlier events of that evening were talking to my boyfriend as we were lying in bed. Then nothing. Until I was violently awoken to what felt like a dream state to multiple uniformed men wearing eye protection/large goggles (which for some reason made it scarier) informing me, in what were hitting my dazed ears as warped words, that I had had some sort of an opioid overdose as I was being wheeled out of the front door of my home on a gurney to an awaiting ambulance. Let me just say... Because I have not seen this spoken about before... Waking up from an opioid overdose by Narcan is absolutely a blessing. However, I have read stories that people wake right up and are walking and talking and normal. I woke up violently. Terrified, confused, combative, swinging at the paramedics. I was shaking so violently I thought I may have been having a seizure. My teeth were clenching and chattering and  it hurt to breathe. I was continuing to be confused as I was being wheeled out and the paramedics told me over and over I was having an overdose because all I could manage to say was “this isn’t real”.. It felt still like a dream. But I felt the winter air hit me and saw the awaiting emergency response vehicles and realized this nightmare was a reality. I was put in the ambulance to be transported to the hospital and I told the paramedics how I was in disbelief this was reality. One of the senior paramedics seemed a bit agitated and told me he knew I had overdosed and asked what I had taken. I was still confused as I was barely coming to at this point and processing what was happening. I asked him if he had administered Nar**n to me. He was surprised by me asking this.... I knew, however, from educating myself previously with my over use of opioids what Nar**n is and that it is the holy grail to what will reverse an opioid OD. He looked at me and said: “Yes, I actually hit you with two doses in the thigh via injection, so what did you take??”. All I managed to say was “some Oxy.” That’s all he needed to hear. He had no idea about my history or the fact that I had taken such a minuscule amount this time when other times I had taken amounts that would tranquilize an elephant. He said one more thing: “That guy back there, he your boyfriend?”. I responded with a yes.... He said, simply: “Well he saved your life.”. The puzzle pieces began to come together when I got to the hospital and my boyfriend arrived and I was stabilized and able to talk to him. Approximately 15 minutes after I believe I snorted the half the Oxy he said I just fell asleep. He figured I was tired. He said about 20 minutes after that he was awakened by and odd sound. He said I was gurgling. He was alarmed by this so he listened to me breathing. He noticed I wasn’t taking actual breaths, and when I did, they were labored and non-beneficial. Again... Thank god for his service in the Air Force as his training kicked in. He took my pulse and it was weak. I wasn’t taking breaths. He called 911 and moved me from the bed to the floor where he began to administer CPR compressions. Let me give you a visual here.. Again I’m a 116lb female and my boyfriend is a 280lb 6’5” male who was putting all of his force into administering chest compressions on me. He continued to do CPR compressions until the first responders arrived and took over. If he hadn’t have caught my abnormal breathing or known how to administer proper CPR... I WOULD BE DEAD. Even after the paramedics took over I flatlined and had to be shocked back to life before they administered the Nar**n. So what happened this time that made it different? The perfect storm. Alcohol+sleep meds+Ox**done. It sent me into respiratory arrest. Even though it was a fraction of a dose of Oxy I once would take. My body’s tolerance had lowered and with the other downers in my system.... For lack of a better phrase... I was fucked. Well, I’m alive. Thank God. I was almost another statistic even though I had “beaten my addiction”. Don’t even tempt it, ever. Don’t mix opioids with alcohol. Or benzodiazepines, or any type of sleep meds, or anything for that matter! No matter how experienced you think you are or how many times you have done it before. It just takes that one time. I’m ok. I’m recovering. I have some cracked ribs from the compressions. But that means they worked. It’s more mentally difficult than anything. Nar**n can save you, but it is a violent and unpleasant experience. It’s a miracle drug but certainly isn’t just like smelling some salts and waking from a nap. No, no, no. You are waking very violently from a nightmare, to a real nightmare. The smell of the Nar**n remained with me for a week post overdose and every time I would get a weird whiff I would have PTSD flashbacks. Head my warning: DON’T mix your pain meds with alcohol or anything!! Even a “little” can be enough to kill you. Be smart. Don’t relapse. That short term high is lame and not even worth it. If you aren’t clean, get clean. Stay clean. Just one time can kill you. No one is ever as experienced with this stuff as they think, despite their past. It will catch you off guard. Last but not least, we are all mere mortals. No one is safe. Stay woke. Now I am.

I awoke after a good night's rest, still kinda high but overall ready to wake up and slam that nice last piece I have saved from the night before. I was going to just do it after my gaming sesh was over at about 3 but I was still pretty high from my last dose so I figured I'd just save the last bit for the AM because I don't know the next time I will be getting high. Payday isn't for another week and idk if I'll be able to afford to even pick up then. So I gathered my tools from the scattered places I left em the night before in my high clumsiness. Went into the bathroom. Got everything ready, took the last bit out. Thought to myself ""yup, nice lil chunk and it's been like 10 ish hours since my last shot, this is gonna feel NICE as FUCK"" threw it in the spoon with about .4ml of water. Heated, mixed, heated, mixed. (It's tar btw, only reason I heat it up is to dissolve it faster) and finally I'm left with my spoon and a nice brown amberish puddle in it. I have a cap to a pill bottle laying next to my spoon with a whole cotton ball siting in it. I pick the cotton ball up to rip a chunk off and as in ripping it off the WHOLE DAMN COTTON BALL just falls into my spoon. ""FUCK"" I yelled so fucking loud and mind you I live with family all of which do not know I use dope. So I think quick right and just take the ball out the spoon and give that bitch a quick glance. ""Yup, this is fucked and now I'm pissed"" There was no water in the spoon, just a cotton ball with one side of it slightly brown. So I tear off the brown parts real quick, there wasn't a whole lot of of surface area thankfully, but still enough to where it was hardly salvageable. Well I took some of my remaining clean rigs, stuffed the brown cotton in each of em with a lil water and just pushed what liquid I could out into the spoon (like you do with old Cotton's) and thankfully I got enough to where I felt the rush a little and got high (I don't really have much tolerance). But still much was wasted..

So fucking restless. so restless.) all the while freezing to death, shaking, with all the hairs on your arms sticking STRAIGHT UP. for MINUTES AT A TIME. soooo cold..... legs and arms twitching out of your control is enough to make you consider a life without arms and legs. where's the hacksaw. who needs them right now when they're this big of an annoyance. you make it back to your bed.... (you never actually do get to clean that throwup off you btw, you sleep in that for the next 24 hours, so hot) just to cry, kick your legs and arms, get no sleep.

You can buy every color fent on the street so I'm not curious about what street users are buying. Strictly wondering about people who have bought fentalouges online (like furanyl fent, acetyl fent, butryr fent, etc) ..what analouge it was, and what color it was when it came shipped - under the impression it hadn't been previously cut !

I ordered 5 grams of some butryr fent I wanna say in...2015? 2014? Maybe 2016 shit my memory is baddd and it came as an off white color (slightly yellowed white) , powder.took months to blow through that in a few refills of a nasal spray bottle. Admittedly by the end nothing got me well and nothing touched the we.but I'm getting off track now so hopefully some of you can answer my ?! 

Happy nods!

ahpxcu,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/ahpxcu/sub_ceiling_question_not_your_normal_one/,0,https://redd.it/ahpxcu,JKFishTrip,Sub Ceiling Question (Not Your Normal One),"Ok so many of us know about Suboxone/buprenorphine's ceiling on the more pleasurable Mu receptor effects like euphoria and the like, ""less is more/better,"" that under a dose between 2 and 4 mg it works more like a full agonist via its metabolite norbuprenorphine. 

So then, say 1 mg means norbuprenorphine takes hold and produces full agonist effects and 2mg is the point where it acts as a partial agonist, and norbupe isn't doing its thing .

Well, what if you took 1 mg. Norbupe sets in. Like an hour or two later took another 1 mg. In theory then the norbupe isn't working and the bupe itself, as a partial agonist, is. Following me?

Well, when the 1st mg starts to wear off before the 2nd one, or in general as the levels of bupe fall, does there come a point where the concentration of bupe has fallen below a threshold enough to where then any ambient norbupe can re-effect you? 

Then, in theory, some of the effects post-peak would actually feel more euphoric/pleasant than the peak itself (if this is even a thing).

Also hypothetically, I imagine this would only work if you first took a full agonist/sub-ceiling dose (ie 1 mg) and let it kick in, thus resulting in norbupe binding to the receptors and then took more to where it cumulatively goes higher than the ceiling dose (2 or 4 mg total), as opposed to if you just took say a whole 4 mg and once and waited until it wore off where the levels fell significantly because in that scenario, norbupe was never created or latched on to the receptors in the first place?

Curious about people's thoughts on this one.

Just wondering because I'm downing my Suboxone dosage lately (and feel great overall btw), and took 1 mg at like 1 pm and felt very good (not high, but, notably good) and then at 3pm just dosed another 1mg.

Also just in case anyone wants this random internet guy's opinion: taking 1 mg 3-4x a day feels significantly better than when I took 12 mg all at once or sometimes broken into two, which I did only a month ago. Other factors are at play but I haven't felt this light and jovial and all-around pleasant in a [disturbingly] long time!

   I will do between 6 to 20 a day for 10 to 14 days straight, and this is what my withdrawal looks like...usually 20 hrs since last use.

1. Stinky body odor (noticed only by me...intimacy isn't occurring), as well as smelling an 'off' scent where ever I go
2. Painful swollen fingers
3. My personal favorite, the two-ton constipation issue (details not needed as most know the drill)
4.  the hot cold flash and goosebumps
5. The feeling of having to cough up lots of mucous which brings on the throwing up
6. EXHAUSTION for 2 days followed by insomnia

Since then, I have tried to do everything humanly possible to help him. 

I read online about the vivitrol shot, it sounded like a miracle in a syringe. Take the shot once a month, and it prevents you from getting high.... great!! 
I called clinics, said we would be self pay, the first response was verbatim “Well ma’am, let me rip this band aid off and tell you it’s $1000 for just the shot, that doesn’t cover admin fees” WTF.

When she told me the price, the feeling of despair washed over me, I’m sorry to others who have felt that same feeling. 

Next, I read about the Sublocade shot, again, it’s a monthly shot that slowly releases buprenorphine, it sounded amazing. Called a clinic and was told “Absolutely he’s a candidate, the monthly cost for the shot alone will be $1597” 🤬🤬

So then, I called the sub clinic, because despite the fact he owns a successful business and I have a good career, those prices are unacceptable and quite frankly will hurt our pockets over time. The sub clinic is cash only (go figure) $350 for first visit and that does not cover the price of the medication.

Of course there’s the methadone clinic, which is a great resource... but it’s not for everyone. 

The point of this rant is, I am sorry to everyone who has called to get help and has heard the words I have. Knowing there’s something that can save your life, but almost impossible to get is devastating. 

HOW THE FUCK can the govt declare a war on drugs but not hold the pharmaceutical companies accountable? Why is there no cap on what these greedy fucks can charge for a medicine to help treat the “epidemic” they spawned? 

The owners of Purdue Pharma are billionaire’s, yes with a b. They made that fortune off the suffering of people like you guys and my bf. That’s fucked. All of these lawsuits the govt are filing against them, where will that money go?? They should mandate the millions they will eventually win goes to funds to cover the outrageous cost of treatment instead of setting up shitty daily methadone clinics in the hood and saying “here ya go!, I know you’re trying to live a better life, but EVERY DAY, you have to come to the ghetto, stand in line, maybe be late to your job and take your dose so you can get better. Sure some of you may have kids but you have to figure that out because you HAVE to come to the hood to get better.” WTF.

If you’ve made it this far in my rant, I just  want to say again, I’m sorry.

Thought I had it figured out through experience, internet research, etc. Then I was talking to another addict and I suddenly realized I didn’t know a damn thing about it.

People say it’s a disease or its this or its that but nobody explains how it really works.

Here’s my take on it. There are like 5 types of humans. All humans have problems. Most do or don’t deal with them on some level.

I‘m the type of human that knew, from way young, that something was wrong. I knew that there was a problem, but I couldn’t even start to verbalize it. I just got a little weird sometimes, just like everybody else.

Then one day, I take a drug. Suddenly, the problem is gone. I’m good for the first time in my life. Then I want to take it again, and I do. Soon, all that matters is getting the drug and being ok as a result.

So now I have a fake happiness and a fake life. The only problem is that, inevitably, I burn everything else down. I throw away real life and real people. Like a pack of wolves eating an animal, each wolf tears off a piece and runs away to protect it.

I get my dope and retreat somewhere to guard and protect it, alone. There may be people around, but I am still alone with the dope.

So now it has been 10 years. One day, I realize that my happiness is fake and I begin to long for real happiness. But now I am isolated. I have a criminal record. My family does not trust me. When girls find out I’m an addict, they either run away or go through some kind of martyrdom trying to save me. 

Society says you are a predator and we are sheep, so we’re putting you behind a fence and you are going to have to stay there.

Now I learn that it is a disease or that I have to admit that I am powerless or it is a matter of my brain neuro transmitters and dopamine or yadda yadda. 

So I say what the hell? I don’t care about any of this. I am quitting. Keep your fake life, I am done.

And I do. But it is hard and there is truth to all the theories and none of them. I have to relearn what it means to be human. I have to connect with my family and learn how to have friends. It takes a minute to accomplish this. My brain, body and spirit has to heal. 

But most of all, I have to face the truth that I have been avoiding all this time. I did this. Nobody else.

So I do. And now, drugs are just another poison that I avoid. I personally don’t need anything but this basic truth. I would no more take drugs that I would dive in a pool of sulfuric acid. 

There will always be a price to pay and I pay it willingly. I stand up, take my lumps and reconnect anyway. Because the bottom line is we are all humans and humans need humans. Most people would rather be in the company of psychos and killers that being locked up alone. Solitary is the ultimate punishment.

So that’s my take on it. Choose real life. You’ll do it anyway in the long run. Save yourself some pain.

I don't have that much experience with coke but I have shot it  a few different times. This time however everytime I do even the smallest shot(30mg or so) I get the worst nausea and violent vomiting. I almost wouldn't even call it nausea it really almost hurts sometimes.
 
So my question is what are the effects of shooting relatively pure coke vs shit with an active cut ike caffeine or psuedo. Is this just some real fuego shit I'm not used to or is this a sign of some kind of cut up bs.The high itself is actually very relaxing and not tweaky at all. However there really isn't that much euphoria and I'm kinda disappointed. ",1547902862.0

These are HCL too with no APAP so  I am sure some of you get a boner @ these. I have been doing opes for 6 years now, almost exclusively oxy 15s and then hydro 10s the last few years. Never touched H. I've never railed or IV'd my oxys, always oral route. 

Some of you probably think I am a tool for going Oxy HCL down the hatch lol. Oh well. Enjoy the porno. They feel good, there's 58.5 after tonight haha. 

Also these are 100% legit and not pressed garbage. I hate fent and my body knows damn well oxy vs fent. Ughhh. Pressed fent pills taken orally just feels like utter shit. These oxys are the opposite. Gonna wake up tomorrow feeling so satisfied lol.

It may be long, I’m not quite sure yet.  - EDIT - YES IT’S GETTING LONG AS FUCK

Yeah. I shot up heroin. Well, I sat and watched some one stick a needle in me, I should say. 

I had ways of justifying it to myself, which I’ll try to explain. They seemed like good reasons, like I had the right motives, and was making a risky, but justified, decision. 

Of course, I’m pretty confident it was the wrong decision. But hey, we’re addicts. Making bad decisions is kind of our thing. We’re really really good at it.

Today was my 16th day of treatment at the methadone clinic. 

I’ve been on this ride for about 5 (edit - fixed typo from 6 to 5) years now. A short ride compared to some, a long ride compared to others. But that’s not really important. We’re all on our own ride, our own journey with the destination largely unknown. It’s my ride and I don’t need to compare it to anyone else’s. 

So, 5 years. 

Let’s not include or count a hydrocodone phase 20 years ago. After my mom passed away from cancer and I found her stash of giant industrial size bottles that came in the mail like all time. Huge bottles. Bottles that size of hydrocodone are unheard of now, at least any place that’s not behind a pharmacy counter. I won’t venture to guess how many pills came in a full bottle. It was a fuck-ton. Hundreds. Multiple hundreds I think. This sounds crazy and unrealistic to many of you, but anyone as old as me who was in the pill game 20 years ago may know what I’m taking about. I didn’t know a pill game existed at the time. I just liked to smoke weed. 

This was before hydrocodone abuse was an everyday topic of discussion. I didn’t know what this shit was. But I liked to snoop, found those fuckers, and they caught my interest. 

I was a nerdy kid who liked to read, and was also intrigued by all things rebellious, and I actually remember reading books and making the mental connection that hydrocodone was a synthetic form of a chemical that could be obtained from the opium poppy. The opium poppy was what heroin came from. Heroin was dangerous, cool, and made you feel amazing. At least that’s what I read. And I liked drugs. I mean I smoked pot, so I was ready for something that was sort of similar to heroin. 

So I ate a lot of hydrocodone. Like a whole lot. There were several bottles. They lasted a long time. And then they were gone. I don’t remember if I got dopesick. I should have, when I think back on it, and how much I took and for how long, but I don’t recall much of a physical withdrawal. I do remember being very mentally challenged when I ran out. I was sad, depressed. I thought about those pills a lot. This was a big deal that they were now gone. But... I didn’t know where to get any more. The idea of scoring pills on the street was an utterly foreign concept to me. I moved on. 

And opioids slowly became a distant memory.  I was about 19 years old at this time. 

That hydrocodone phase, while a important and notable development in my short life, doesn’t really 
play into my current situation. 

It is almost certainly the genesis of this entire clusterfuck I find myself in today, as it seems the thirst for opioids was developed, and apparently never really quenched.

15 goddamn years I didn’t touch a pill. Never really thought about them, but I don’t think that thirst ever really went away. It was there hiding, waiting for the opportunity to pounce. 

But the 5 years. The ride. My 5 year ride. It’s a separate entity from that time I tried to destroy my liver with APAP 20 years ago. 

So the 5 year ride. 

Well fuck. There’s more to talk about before the ride starts. So much happens. It’s not part of the ride, but it’s like the warm up laps. I think the ride wouldn’t be what it is without some of what happened during that 15 years. I think it might be important. 

But I’m tired. Typing on my phone is becoming difficult. 

Does reddit have a character limit for posts? I think they do. I’m not sure why I think that, but I do think that. 

If so, this story will absolutely exceed that limit. 

I’m, right now, in real time, making the decision to tell the story in parts. Part one is over. 

It’s really nothing spectacular. I hope people don’t invest their time reading it and be disappointed and hate me when the story sucks. 

But I want to tell it. ",1547854623.0

  I definitely get upset but I find that if you don’t act outrageous and (depending on the situation of course) be as polite and understanding about the mix up you’ll get yourself right rather than being a complete dick and trying to fight and be an ass about it gets you little to nowhere, I mean especially if they already have your bread. 

Story time: today I set up my usual payday pick up and since I’m new to town I’m still dealing with a middle, I’m not naive to the game and I’m also not an idiot so I know what’s up. I tell him I want a G, I’ve got 145 and he’s been talking to the plug since yesterday letting him know what I wanted and how much bread I had, so it’s all green. Well bro and I go and meet the plug he hops in the car gives me the paper and I look at it he tells me I eyeballed it but if it’s short just let me know how much and I got you, so I’m like alright cool I’m going home to clock it, I’ll let you know blasé blasé.. the town I just relocated to is suuppper small and the prices are def more than I’m used to $125-140/g so im spending a lot to maintain. When I clock it, it comes out to a sad .56 needless to say I’m upset, the middle hadn’t even got his paper yet either and they did the transaction in front of me, and I knew when he said he eyeballed it that it’d be short but i needed the dope and figured it couldn’t be that short but alas it was. Luckily literally everyone knows everyone in this town and so my middle literally knows him and his whole family etc etc so it’s not a problem and my middle said it’s happened to him once before but not that bad, and I’m sure he probably picked up the gram for me last night cause I was trying to buy it at 12 but my middle fell asleep, and ended up using some of it to stay well himself not realizing he used that much sold it to me as a g.

We split it up in equal three sections. Over the course of 3 hours we hit little bumps and lines. Around 10 PM my husband nodded out and passed out. My roommate and I didn't initially freak because we did the same amount my husband had worked two shifts back to back and didn't sleep the night before because he did speed. His lips didn't change color, he didn't vomit and he was breathing kinda slow but normally. His pulse appeared normally. I checked on him every 15-20 minutes and everything seemed fine. He started breathing normally around 2 so I went to bed. I woke up at 6 and his breathing was very shallow so we rushed him to the hospital and he passed away at 6:50 AM.

&#x200B;

We didn't get it, we thought H OD's were pretty fast. Got the toxicology report a few weeks later. He tested positive for weed, alcohol, and H. The amount of H in his system was 51 mg when they did the test. I didn't know about the alcohol initially otherwise I would have rushed him to the hospital immediately. He lied to me about that. It turns out he drank two OE's around 5:30-6:00 (when he was ""at the store"")

&#x200B;

What I am trying to understand was how fast does H metabolize? If he started sniffing around 6-9 and passed out at 10 how much do you think was in his system? Could it been a fatal amount or does it sound like it wasn't a fatal amount and the alcohol was what pushed him over the edge? That also might explain why it took so long to kill him?

&#x200B;

I guess I just want to know because I feel guilty. If it was a non fatal amount and he died due to the combo of the H and drinking I will feel less bad. But if it was a fatal amount I will feel worse for not rushing him immediately. ",1547835672.0

Been IV’ing dillys for a bit now. Love it

About a year ago I tried boy for the first time, insufflated because at that time I never IVd.

Loved it. A lot. Too much. So I didn’t do it often. Never really bought it just kinda threw down and would get a half occasionally and just rail lines here and there. Eventually my tolly grew and I started IV.

Well my dude left to another state for a while for treatment so for about 4 months I had access to dope maybe 2-3 times.

He comes back like a week ago and got some. All while he’s been gone I was still doing my dillys. Thought I’d be straight. Silly me.

Did a test shot of the boy. Didn’t feel shit. So 20 mins later did another shot. Still relatively small.

Then I wake up in my apartment surrounded by medics and police. Only found the needle which they are charging me with. Luckily two days later when they came and arrested me with the warrant I was only in jail for like 6 hours, my girl came and bailed me out. She’s a saint.

I refused the ambulance trip because I woke up as they were around me but they essentially forced me to go.

But yeah. My dude who called told the police he found me like that and everything was mine etc etc. They knew he was full of it considering he has multiple pending charges and iv never even got a ticket. 

Cop tried drilling me in the hospital. Wouldn’t say shit without a lawyer. She’s like “this isn’t what this is we just need to know where you got it and also the needle so we know how to treat you.” I’m like... so the tox panel and me telling you what it was is relevant to how these doctors are going to “help” me. She gets all shitty and I’m just reiterating she can come back when I have my attorney. At that point she knew she wasn’t getting shit and left.

Pretty much a shit post. Thanks to my friend I suppose I’m alive. I mean I did wake up but at least he called. But he also tried to say everything that was his was mine, so whatever.

All in all. Happy to be alive. 
Be safe brothers. I’m going through quite the depression right now and I’m not going to lose my girl, we’ve been together for 6 years and her and her family are nothing but supportive and bonded me out and are getting me the lawyer. But I just hate myself for putting everyone through that. But I will earn their trust back. 

I won’t be touching boy again. I have urges and the possibility to get it but haven’t and won’t. Not worth me losing everything, almost already happened.

Just felt like sharing my experience with some people who may understand or been there with me or had similar situations. I’m trying to be strong. I have to work I have an apartment and bills and everything so I can’t go to rehab but I’m thinking maybe getting a suboxone script.

Anyway, love you guys. Be safe. Be careful. I’m happy I’m alive, and give me the strength to stay away from the dope.",1547791763.0

I'm on the way to a buddy of mine house who is trying to taper, so I was trading him 20, 8mg sub strips for 15 blues. (Helluva deal I know, lol) and my left headlight goes out. So I'm thinking to myself, ""not ideal but Walmart us literally 5 minutes down the road from his house. I'll stop, do my business and head straight there""..... 
Well I leave and like 2 seconds after I get out of his street I get pulled. At first I'm freaking the fuck out thinking its narcotics and they had been tailing me all day or something (all day I had been doing business, more heavily than normal), but then I see it's some, fresh to the squad 18 or 19 year old, and I think to myself, at least it's not narcotics. But I'm still freaking out because I have more pills than I can eat on me, and a 30 of meth and almost an oz of fire ass bud. I honestly was preparing to go to jail because I figured as soon as he stepped up to the window he'd smell the weed, and I'd be fucked on felony charges, which I have none. 

Well he gets up to the window, asks for my license, and asks if i knew the headlight was out, which i tell him, yes, and i was literally on the way to get it fixed. He goes and runs my license, hands it back to me and says,""get that thing fixed before I gotta give you a ticket""

Let’s start from the beginning, I’m 29 and I started drinking at 13. Was tank through out highs cool and it and it always stuck with me. I’m at the point now where I can drink about a liter of cheap Svedka vodka to pass out and wake up the next day fine.  


Skipping over the natural progression of marijuana because that’s not even a drug pshhh....  Around 20 I got a script for adderall because I was in an Electrical Engineering program and would burn through a months supply in 2 weeks usually.  Even when I graduated I used to love eating them like candy staying awake for days chain smoking while  playing Diablo 3 or Stardew Valley. Well around 27 something clicked in me and I don’t crave them like I use to so now I sell 50/60 30mg pills I get.  My tolerance for adderall never changed I would always feel it’s effects. 



Back on track my tolerance for opiates (strictly oral or insufflating) is stupidly high to the point where 150mg+ and I still won’t feel a thing.  I’ve never once withdrawn from them no matter how bad/long of a binge I go on. I have no physical dependency, the only reason I continue to cope almost every night is because of this itch in the back of my head. It just makes me think man I could really use a blue, and time after time I will just pick up one or two when I’m broke and be perfectly happy just snorting them knowing it’s going to do absolutely nothing.  


When it comes to Xanax my tolerance fluctuates so long as I take 5mg-6mg daily in spurts in order to just knock me out. I don’t want a Xanax high I just want amazing sleep.


Now the strange thing is when ever I talk to anyone about alcohol, Oxys, or Xanax withdrawal they look at me in disbelief and just flat out refuse the idea of it being possible that I never withdraw from anything. I’ve only ever been able to find one article a while back which I sadly don’t remember the details about a doctor talking about a patient who never suffered withdrawals despite going cold turkey after 3+ years of daily usage at a high dose. 


That’s my story and I would truly love to hear from anyone and everyone. Anyone with any questions, ideas, or insights into why I never had to experience what I can only describe as torture by being a bystander when I let my best friend detox for 2 days with only 8x8mg suboxone pills. I will be checking back frequently in hopes someone will respond, and if more information is needed I will answer anything asked of me.  I will seldom bump this thread for the next week and if the community sees it fit to let this thread die I won’t resist it. 

Thank you anyone who took the time to read this and I look forward to hopefully some sort of discussion starting. ",1547785528.0

ah58wx,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/ah58wx/my_plug_is_lame/,33,https://redd.it/ah58wx,jbenso30,My plug is lame..,"I started going to this connect in the middle of 2017 daily, and they were the best. It's a husband and wife from Honduras, that's why I say ""they"". I'm going to give you all a little timeline so you can understand my frustration a little more. 

The first 6-8 months they didn't have a vehicle so when I'd call to meet they'd have me go to their apartment building and they'd be out within 5 minutes of me arriving every time, majority of that time they'd be waiting for me outside cause they knew it only took me 8 minutes to drive there. They would give me 2 free b's almost every single day just because I would spend a minimum of $60 a day, a lot of times I was spending over $150 a day because I would get white as well. I would also get a free one every $100 I spent on top of the 2 free ones. It was great. They also would need a ride a couple times a week and it's always be to the same place 15 minutes away, and they would give me 2&2 ($40 worth of shit) for the ride. 

After that 6-8 months they finally got a vehicle. They'd give me a meeting spot and sometimes they would wait for me to arrive or I'd wait for them to arrive, it was never a long wait. They cut back on the free ones they would give me just because. They always would do a free one every $100 spent, but they stopped giving me 2 free ones every day, but would still do it once or twice a week. It was still awesome. I expected no freebies because they would be having more expenses because of their vehicle. This went on until about October of 2018. During that year and a half I probably was fronted $80 worth of shit a couple times a month. I got my first front after going through them for several months and because I always paid them back when I said they did it whenever I needed it. Then in October they said they could only front me 1&1 at a time, even though I never was late on a payment, but I said okay because it was better than nothing on the days I needed the help. They also stopped giving out free ones at that time too, other than the one every $100. I was bummed but it was whatever. Then out of nowhere yesterday I asked them for a 1&1 front for the first time in a month and they said no because they do not trust anyone anymore so no credits.. I was confused cause I always paid when I said I would, so I mentioned that to them and they responded with ""I cannot see you anymore because you ask again when I said no more"" so I said ""I only asked why because I always pay"" and they said ""It does not matter I do not do credit anymore"" so I just spent last night sick, got my paycheck today and hit them up and it rang all the way through and no answer. I wait 15 minutes, because they'd always call me back instantly. So I call them again and it rings once and goes to voicemail, so I assume they screened it because they were busy so I try again 10 minutes later and same thing. At this point I think it's odd so I try 4 more times within 20 minutes and the same thing everytime so I call on my house phone and it rings through with no answer and I know they dont recognize the number so i call right back and she answers and hears it's me and hangs up.. So I call again and it rings once and goes to voicemail, and kept doing that every call. So they blocked my number and were for real when they said they wouldn't see me anymore.. I spent over a grand a week for majority of the 2 years I used them, and minimum $400 a week and yet they block me for asking for a front when they had done it over 40 times for me.. They used to be the best and gradually got worse for some odd reason and then blocked me for the stupidest shit. Fuck em. 

Sorry I wrote this on a phone. 

TLDR: Honduran connect that I've been using for 2 years, and would spend over a grand a week on their stuff, blocked me this morning because I asked for a $20 front, when I've had 40+ fronts in those two years and always paid back on time, every time. Majority of those fronts were $80 fronts at a time too. ",1547775491.0

I usually do lines and I usually taste the dope. But I know not to sniff really hard where it all goes straight down my throat. Sometimes it takes a few minutes for me to even taste it, sometimes it’s immediate.

ah2dqs,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/ah2dqs/withdrawal_different_depending_on_drug/,14,https://redd.it/ah2dqs,JKFishTrip,Withdrawal Different Depending on Drug?,"Ok, so of course depending on the half-life of different drugs the duration of the withdrawal will differ, and the intensity varies by dose but as a generalization since some drugs are consumed in larger doses (heroin) than some (codeine, hydrocodone), the H withdrawal will feel subjectively more intense to anyone going through it.

However: do the specific symptoms vary by each drug?

Before virtually ALL dope in my area had fentanyl as a cut, back when I had one steady supplier who'd sell the same stamp for months, the sickness had a few trademarks. 

Nowadays (or recently I should say--clean now), all the dope I have gotten my hands on in the last 2+ years has had fentanyl in it (confirmable by UAs and the police's lab analysis). 
Many around here also have ""tranq,"" which is some sort of fentalog nobody knows for sure the identity of. Possibly carfentanil. Would be nice to know. Increasingly, batches do not even contain ANY heroin at all, or they sprinkle in only a token amount so yeah, it's *technically* H cut with fentanyl, but functions more like fentanyl with heroin in it. Anyway, ever since the shift, the withdrawal just feels a little different...

Like for example, when it was just heroin, I couldn't eat if you asked me to even just 16 hours after my last bag(s). Fentanyl though, I've still eaten regular meals at the 30, 36 hour mark! It didn't sit well, and it left my body almost as fast as it went in, but I could mentally and physically stomach it.

Also, heroin--never got the cold sweats and temperature flux. Sure, a hot day in heroin withdrawal felt extra hot, the cold was freezing, and I'd get shivers down my spine and that kind of thing. But in more recent times, jeez...less than 24 hours later I start to sweat and get chills. Underneath a blanket or wearing a hoodie/long sleeves I feel so hot and sweaty. Take it off, no blanket or a thin sheet or shirtless or a t-shirt and I am so cold. Sometimes hot and cold at the same time. Sheets so drenched in sweat that I don't bother switching them til i get well--it's easier to wash one disgusting set of sheets than my whole roster of blankets, which I could easily ruin in a few hours. The hair allover my body stands up and I get goosebumps too. It feels like hell. Well, all withdrawal feels like hell, but heroin never did anything close to that (as it relates to that particular symptom).

Additionally:
It seems like I can sleep more consistently as I come off of fent versus heroin;
Fentanyl leaving my body leaves me with more tremors and a general shakiness compared to H;
And in general fent causes more stuff to ooze out of nearly ever hole in my body (teary eyes, sweating, runny nose, diarrhea, vomit if I go long enough, spontaneous ejaculation even!). Not that heroin didn't do most of those things, and that last one there being worse with F might be because the amount of fent being ingested exceeded the equivalent amount of H that was being ingested and thus naturally it'd feel more intense.

While I've tried many opiates/opioids, oxycodone and Suboxone are the only other two I have extensive experience with (daily use for more than a few weeks). For logical reasons I haven't felt anything comparable after stopping them:

Oxycodone I used when I first picked up a habit and seemed to 'get out of jail free' every time I'd stop after even a month or two binge; the last and largest binge I transitioned to dope at its terminus. One day 30's started actually costing $30 in my town, and overnight I switched from using blue pills to blue bags...If anything, the cessation from 30s was just cravings, anxiety, tension--mostly mental plus a diminished appetite and minor stuff like yawning, teary eyes, and worse restless legs than usual. Had I gone on to use heavy for longer, or if today I started doing blues for a few weeks and then stopped, surely I'd feel something more comparable in its intensity to the F and H.

Suboxone I've never had to genuinely detox from either even though I have taken it for months and months on end because every time I stop subs it is because I go back to doing dope like a dumbass...
I mean seriously, what was I thinking every time I did that shit? ""Steady job, great girlfriend, legal situation is better, finances improving, family trusting me again, apartment, dog, cat, people and animals relying on me? That's the perfect time to do the thing that fucks me over every single time by going on a months-long bender and just throw it all away! Fuck you; fuck me!""

I digress though...

So In about eleven days I'll be having a basic outpatient procedure for which I'll be anesthetized and go under for about an hour. Lately I've been chipping some wonderful H and and I'm just wondering if that's going to cause any issues. I am in the middle of tapering off but I'm not trying to go cold turkey and quit all at once. I was thinking my last dose(after a few days reducing my intake) would be tomorrow. 

Is my tolerance going to affect my anesthesia? Is my usage something that I really need to even tell the doctor? I'm not even concerned about not getting good medication after as much as I am about them not wanting to do the surgery or just generally being lame about my usage. Has anyone gone through something similar? I've done a couple searches on here and some people say to tell the doctors, others say not to. Just wondering what I should do and if I'll be okay just stopping 10+ days before the surgery. I'm leaning towards just tapering off and not saying anything to the doctor. With that in mind, am I better off keeping with a decremented dosage of H, or should I switch to a suboxone?

Myself and several others have reached out to these people and offered assistance to provide rides, hotel room, food... etc.  

Last night myself and others did what we could to get a young lady who had been kicked out of treatment several thousand miles from her home, into a hotel room, fed and a ride home.   I was able go get her a room and another poster was generous enough to send her the cash to get home. 

Wouldn't it be nice if there was a crowd sourced fund where people who found themselves in fucked up situations like that could maybe apply for emergency assistance ?  While I understand that some might try to take advantage of it, a great many people who come here would benefit.  

Naturally, there would need to be rules... for example, the fund could be used to purchase a hotel room, bus/plane tickets, uber, food delivery, maybe even in store pick-up for warm clothing or toiletries, for folks who suddenly find themselves in urgent need after being booted from treatment.

Harm reduction is supposed to be about keeping people safe... saving lives and well, reducing the incidence of harmful effects on mental/physical health.  I feel that if someone wants to go to treatment and try to get clean, they should have every available opportunity to do so.. no matter if they have to do it 1, 2 or 10 times.. as long as they continue to try.  Families are not always understanding of this, and after having their sometimes unrealistic expectations dashed over and over again, they become unwilling to provide support.  It would be amazing if there were more resources out there that could help people right away from anywhere.

And it would always get 1000x worse when I would get a girl friend bcuz I work very hard to hide my use and some would think I’m cheating on them and always question me about it. And some of them bcuz I get grouchy and irratiable and distant when going thru w/ds and normally I’m funny and goofy they think I’m bipolar and need to see a therapist the lies I make up start to confuse me at times and it gets out of control. And I’m single now bcuz I wanted to get sober I mean shit I do love opis but I know I’m never gonna have the life I want with me using them and I’ve been working on weaning my self off I mean it’s been a year but I’ve gone from 240 mg of oxy a day in dec 2017 to about 30 mg a day currently and there where points where it would be as low as 5 mg a day in certain points in 2018 so it’s a long process but I feel I’m getting close anyway sorry for getting off track but i guess Im asking how many years in or at what point did it change for you?

Don't pick opiates up if you haven't thus far in your life. I know most of you will do the complete opposite but before you do just know a few things...

- Once you pick opiate usage up it will be the hardest thing in your life to put down. Even if your able to put it down you will always want to pick it back up.

- Enjoy being broke 24/7 because you need your fix. Even if your not broke broke you will not have nearly as much as you would have if you never tried it that first time.

- Do you enjoy being alone? I mean alone alone no friends, family, etc. because you will lose them all chasing your fix and even if you think you have friends they are just there to get high off your stuff. Once the drugs and money are gone so will they.

- Once you finally decide to give up the opiates they will follow for months with the sickness and withdraws you will experience removing them from your body. Hot and cold sweats, vomiting, shaking, anxiety, and more... 

Once you bring opiates into your life your going to have 4 choices to pick from for the rest of your life... 

1) Dealing with the sickness of withdraws and living with the monkey on your back for the rest of your life wanting you to do them one more time. 

2) Going to jail for some dumb shit on opiates or to get your fix of opiates to keep you from dealing with withdraws.

3) Being a junky the rest of your life and lose everything and everyone that was in your life one by one and sit there and watch your life crumble infront of you but you take another hit or pop another pill to ease the pain and not care.

4) Death... Unfortunately it happens to some of the best people you could ever think of but that is part of the game that your playing with your life.

Hopefully this will stop just one first timer from trying opiates because this is not the game you want to join. There are no such thing of winning in the game of opiates. The whole game is based on losing starting from money to friends and family, then comes your car and house and finally if you keep playing you will lose your life unfortunately ether it be jail or death.",1547710598.0

Its quite a bit softer than legit tar and has this shiny sheen sort of look to it. Doesnt break apart like legit tar, its kind of all one cohesive unit/blob. The shot is much too dark to be legit tar and it looks and feels oily in a way. It does not have the same euphoric rush but definitely gets you high and staves off the sickness, but something just feels really off/a bit sickening about it.

Does this sound familiar to anyone? Im just wondering if anyone has had a similar experience and want to know if you ever found out what it was. I had something very similar a year or two ago except it made me vomit a lot and gave me really bad eczema on my hand. This stuff just make me feel nauseous and idk, just off.

So a quick back story: I was clean for about 4 years, with the help of suboxone, relapsed about a year ago & have been using ever since. 

I’m trying to get back to the sober life. I work in a steel mill & trying to do all of this without burning vacation days & was going to attempt when I get a few days off.   I have a few questions regarding the route I want to take.

1. I want to use kratom to help with the withdrawals. My state currently classifies kratom as illegal, so am I not allowed to order from the web? I am very close to a neighboring state where kratom is legal. If I went to a shop that carries kratom, is the quality just as good as buying it off the web? If there’s a way to just order online I would prefer to go that route.

2. I’ve heard/seen from many posts on here that gabapentin does wonders for withdrawal. I don’t know anyone in my group of friends that has any, or knows anyone that does. What’s the best way to be able to get it prescribed?

3. I have plenty of bunavail (different brand of suboxone) left over from when I was sober. I’m pretty sure I’ll end up getting back on that, I just know that takes a little longer to stabilize on it since you have to wait 48-72 hours.

Just a few questions I had before I attempt the sober life again, I’m ready to get this monkey off my back again for good. Thank you guys for all the help, laughs, & great conversations. To those still using, be safe, & to those that are sober, keep on keeping on ❤️",1547699505.0

Here is how I did it.,"I've been writing for over an hour and keep having to wipe my process because I slip in too much detail that could identify me. Here is the condensed version (we are talking another 10 paragraphs before)

This is a modified take of the ""three day suboxone taper"" which says to dose lower and lower over three days.

WARNING: This guide mentions taking a large dose of suboxone. If you are a low tolerance user this is likely FAR TOO MUCH AND COULD POTENTIALLY BE FATAL. ADJUST ACCORDINGLY. Seriously, if you have only been a daily user for 2 weeks and doing just 60mg of oxy a day, do not do this.

You will need:

1. Suboxone (about 3x8mg)
2. Kratom (read up on good strains for opiate withdrawals.
3. Loperamide. Yep, anti shit pills. Don't need the huge bottle but it is a good value at walmart, get it anyways.
4. Alcohol. Your choice (probably not beer though) Yep. I chose to fight my demons with an old demon friend ;)
5. Gatorade. Hydration will help you and your body a lot in this process. Being dehydrated (day one I tried drinking water all day and was still pissing dark yellow)
6. To watch this video on WHY addiction happens: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao8L-0nSYzg&feature=youtu.be Seriously, this did a lot for me. You WILL learn something from this that will help you.
7. Plan your last dose to be in the morning so you are withdrawing in the afternoon. If you are able to, plan this around when you can have 3ish days off. KEEP TRACK OF WHEN YOU LAST DOSED.
8. Here is what you do with it. You're going to use the Kratom and Loperamide to get you through early withdrawals before taking the suboxone. No more than 10mg Loperamide, 10g kratom for day one. Got it? You know you more than I do. For me, 12 hours seemed to always be the point where I'd be in enough withdrawal to take suboxone. That means take the kratom and loperamide at the the 3/4 mark, or for my case, 9 hours after the last dose. Keep track of the time since your last dose. We need it again. You will be withdrawing of heroin but not feeling like it. I was at the 12 hour mark, I waited till 14. Whatever your ""withdrawal number"" is, add 2-3 hours to it. At that point, take 8mg of the suboxone and wait for it to fully dissolve/absorb. Actually, you've made it this far in this list, take TWO! Thats right. Night one we kick off with 16mg of suboxone. This dose will flood your brain. You dont want to take them both at once in case you happen to throw up, have to talk on a phone, anything that will cause it to just salivate away. This way you can salvage one. The steps for night one are complete. If you cant sleep, drink a little. Its okay, you earned it.
9. Day two is upon us. Get up, and reflect on yourself. Say ""I havent used heroin in 24 hours...and I feel fine."" Feels great doesnt it. Wait 24 hours since last suboxone dose, and take the last 8mg. Tonight should be easier. If you are REALLY having a hard time, take loperamide and kratom again. Avoid otherwise, I'll explain later. Again, alcohol if needed for sleep only. Do not day drink.
10. Wait, we are on Day THREE already? All right! You would conceivably be in the WORST of it for today if you went cold turkey. Today we aren't taking any opiates or antagonist though. It isn't as scary as it seems however. The incredibly long halflife of suboxone will leave you fine all day long. Trust me. Do not take anything today. Take Kratom at night before bed if you cant sleep. More to come tomorrow.
11. Day four. The suboxone in your system is getting low, but your body is almost done with withdrawals of heroin, and we arent giving it enough time to get hooked on suboxone, which is very gently depleting its self at a slow rate. You may be back at work at this point, and scared you are going to withdraw. Nope. We have been trying to avoid kratom the last three days if possible so we dont use it as a crutch if we dont need to, or build new dependancy. Now its time for the three day Kratom bender. Take a few doses of kratom today, as needed.
12. Days five, six. Taper down the kratom. If you get a high off it, you're doing too much. This is about feeling normal, not high. If you think a better option for you is to do kratom the rest of your life...by all means do it. It is far less self destructive than heroin. I'll still be far happier for you, and so will you.
13. Day SEVEN. ONE. WEEK. Did you keep track of the time since you last dosed like I said? You wake up and it has been a week since you last used heroin. You may have some small lingering effects. I was an exclusive heroin smoker of over a gram a day. My first few days I woke up coughing and choking on mucus, then going into a small sneezing fit, before being fine the rest of the day. That has seriously been my only problem.
14. What if I screw up? Well, heres the thing. If you fuck up, you just cant restart this process. If you fuck up twice, you cannot return to this process immediately. You will have to wait. Otherwise you're just going to be dependent on probably suboxone and kratom and it wont work for you the same. The goal is to replace one drug with another, then another, then none. All before your body gets hooked to it, all while the other drugs are completely hiding the massive heroin withdraw you are actually in.
15. If you paid attention and watched the video I provided, you will understand that it is possible you didnt become addicted just because heroin is well, addictive. Heroin only has a [capture rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence#Capture_rates) of 23.1%. You used heroin as an escape from life. Something I did over first 3 days was watch a lot of music videos, interviews, concerts, etc getting really interested into one of my old favorite bands (The Smashing Pumpkins, of course. Shout out to James Jimmy D'arcy and the legend William Patrick Corgan. You guys rock and helped me through this) and just watched anything that would get my attention. At one point I had over 60 chrome tabs open. This was me on a path of rediscovery and reconnecting with my happier days. Most importantly, here is what you MUST do to stay clean. You need to ditch the habits heroin-you has, and move forward as someone new, not back as the person that led you to this mess. Go out. Contact old friends. Start working out. Get on Tinder, Okcupid, etc. You have a spouse? You guys kicking it together? GREAT. Happy for you, go out and try something new (not drugs) and see why you connected in the first place (unless that reason was also heroin in which case...fuck)
16. Final points. You need to separate yourself. Burn bridges. Throw away your gear. You cant have the old life around when new life is trying to get shit done. I'm still applying to jobs across the country just to hope I don't come back (this is ironic given my deleted many paragraphs of how I got started, by moving to a new area and being alone, lol, problem was I was still close enough to drive 3 hours every night)


Any questions or comments? Am I giving bad advice? It worked amazing for me, and I hope it can for others. This really was easy. The hardest part is the new person bit, its winter and fucking cold. Oh well, at least I'm not standing out in it waiting for heroin for an hour.",1547693374.0

         About 4 months ago, I was sitting alone at home around noon. Boredom had reached a peak. I thought to myself “Am I just going to sit here another Friday by myself with nothing to do but play video games? I never do shit anymore.”


          I decided to hop on Twitter to see what was happening in the world. Like lightning had struck, one of my favorite metal bands had just tweeted that moment “We’ve added a show in (location redacted) on our tour. Doors open at 6.” 


    I didn’t think i was going to see them this time around on tour. The closest location they were playing was 5 hours away so I had already chalked that up as a no-go. But Lady Luck had her eye on me and this location was only 2 hours and 30 minutes away. That was doable.


       So I checked the bank account, I had juuust enough to get 10 15s, gas to get up there & back, and a ticket to this show. Hell yes! So I got up and made the phone call to my plug, drove 30 mins to pick up my meds, and I was off on my spur of the moment adventure.


       I drove the 180 miles to cross the state line,  drove the other 20 into the city, then I arrived at the venue a little early and got in line. There were a ton of people ahead of me. So many people that I couldn’t even see the door.


     Fast forward 30 minutes, the line started moving.


       “Man, this line is taking forever. Why aren’t they just taking tickets & will call and letting us through!” I thought. Little did I know that my whole world was about to turn upside down.


       I finally got close enough to the doors to see that something else is going on. A fucking POLICE SEARCH OF EVERYONE GOING THROUGH! They were checking pockets, dumping purses, running their hands along waistlines, making people OPEN THEIR MOUTHS , and other weird but thorough searching techniques.


       “Oh fuck!” I thought, “if they’re going to check everywhere on my body, maybe the cigarette pack would be the safest place to put my Roxys (5 15s left) and straw since I just empty my pockets, body search, and go inside.” 


       “Sorry, you’re not a winner” is an old metal song I used to love..... This also just so happened to describe my situation ever so perfectly.


     I got up to the front of the line. I brought all of my belongings out of my pockets, kept them in my hand while they were searching my body. Holy shit, were they thorough! After that, I started to lay down my things on the table. 


       The lady cop said “Sir, can you please hand me your cigarette packs. We’ve been warned of people bringing drugs into the show in their cigarette packs.”


      “WHAT THE FUCK!” This phrase kept rattling around in my head. Time slowed. I knew I was a goner. 200 miles away from home with no way out of this line. I start to hand them to her. One opened, pills and a straw inside, one unopened. 


     My hands started shaking, my panic disorder kicked in. I knew that in this state, it’s an automatic felony and they will prosecute you to the utmost of their ability. Sometimes even making up different names to charge you on a per pill basis. This didn’t help the pain in my chest.


      “Thump”....one of my cigarette packs hit the ground. I reached down quickly and grabbed it. The other one she grabbed out of my hand.... 


       “Huh. This pack is unopened.” She said to me.


     “Oh yeah, they both are. Sorry I should’ve made that clear. My bad!” I chuckled back to her in a shaking, but sweet tone.


     “Okay. Don’t forget your belongings here on the table and have a good time!” She said to me with a genuine smile.


       My heart beat was in my throat. I was holding back tears of despair from before, had now combined with tears of relief. 


     A girl wearing a band shirt took my ticket and I asked her where the bathroom was. She explained but before she could finish, I scurried as quickly yet contained as I could manage, following her directions as if I already knew. I got in a stall and started gasping for air. “How could I have made it through that! Seriously! Why didn’t she check the other pack? Why? Why? Why?” I kept asking myself, feeling like I was going to explode.


     I sat down on the toilet, hands still shaking like a leaf on a windy day. I pulled out the cigarette pack that ALMOST sealed my fate. I shook out a 15, loaded it into my straw, crushed it up on the wall of the stall and my BIC, sniffed, and blasted off. The rush of dopamine was so intense that I almost blacked out. 


     I gathered myself and went in front of the stage, eager to hear my favorite bands play. But more importantly, I was thankful to whoever or whatever was watching over me. I could’ve spent the week in a huge metropolitan jail with no one to get me out. I still feel blessed to this day.



     Thank you everyone who stuck around to the end. This took a lot of time to write but I’ve been meaning to get this up so others can learn from my mistake. I should’ve been more crafty in my approach to hide my meds. Hindsight is 20/20 though.


TLDR: Almost got arrested on multiple counts of possession & paraphernalia charges before going into a metal show. “God” kept me from going to jail in a big city where I definitely would’ve gotten my ass kicked and been in for a while. Also, you should read the whole thing! I feel it’s definitely worth the time and effort!

My usual choice of opiate is codeine. Now I know there is a bit of hate for it here on this sub but I have a prescription for 100X30mg codeine phosphate every couple of weeks, I’m also based in the UK where it’s also pretty easy to get codeine OTC so....excuses..... I usually need close to the ceiling limit for codeine-morphine conversion so I’ll take anywhere between 300-400mg. 

Anyway, I’ve tried dihydrocodeine, morphine (10mg sulphate pills) and OxyContin. Now none of what I’ve mentioned is readily available to myself to get my hands on (apart from on onion fields).

My question to other users of the drugs mentioned above, is it possible to use any of the above mentioned recreationally as I currently do with codeine?

I tried Kratom once a few years ago, it was a Bali red vein if my memory serves, it was a bliss, I melted with the couch and really relaxed me in a way no other substance ever did before.

I want to try it again and wanted to know how fiendish this substance really is, at first I wanted to ask in /r/Kratom but I saw them being harsh with an user here just because pointing out its addiction potential so I'll skip.

Is it worth it? I don't plan to start a new addiction, nobody does...I know...but I'm curious to try it again since I don't remember well the effects and I just want something to chill with.

What's your suggestions?

agokxv,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/agokxv/my_old_dealeri_mean_doctor/,41,https://redd.it/agokxv,Jamie-R,My old dealer...I mean doctor,"Hello everyone! I wanted to share my story about my old pain doctor. This all started when I was about 25, so this was roughly 10 years ago. A rumor started circulating about a doctor that would give you anything as long as you had cash. With nothing to lose, I gave it a try. I gave him cash upfront for the initial visit ($1,000), wasn't guaranteed anything & just spent my whole savings... so I was freaked out! The visit lasted about 3 hours. He asked some strange questions & was just weird all together. I noticed quick that he never asked for MRI's or any kind of records. He simply said ""what kind of pain meds work for you""? Without skipping a beat, I said Oxycontin. He was fine with that & asked what mg I've taken. I told him 80 mg. Again, he didn't give me any weird looks or concern that a ""normal"" doctor would do with a 25 year old healthy patient. At this point, I knew I was walking out of there with at least something. In fact he said, ""besides pain, do you want something to help with sleep & anxiety?"" I said something along these lines, ""Now that you mention that, I do have issues with sleep & anxiety."" When I left the initial visit I was blown away with what he gave me. I had a script for 120 Oxy 80's (4 a day & this was back when they were all the OC ones), 240 30's (8 a day), 90 10mg Valium and 180 10mg Methadone. I happily went to the pharmacy where my total bill was $75 for everything because my insurance kicked ass!! LOL. Each time I went back, he would bump me up. 3 months in he took me up from 120 80's to 180 80s (6 a day). The rest of the meds stayed the same. I liked my oxys, so I typically sold the methadone or kept some back in case I would run out early. I would normally run out after 3 weeks but knew other people who went to him, so finding it wasn't a big deal.

\*\*\*\*\* Here's where it gets crazy!!! \*\*\*\*\*\*

Within a year, he was giving me 240 Oxy 80's (8 a day), 360 Roxy 30's (12 a day), 120 10mg Valium (4 a day), 360 10mg Methadone (120 mg a day), 120 Somas & he also prescribed me Mirilax due to constipation....I was blocked up BAD!! lol. After the initial visit, I only paid $800 cash each month (Around $900 total for visit & scripts). The $900 was never a problem. I had a few friends who put up that money each month for me & in return, I'd give them the 80's for $35 a piece (going rate was around $50 to $60 where I lived in 2009). At this point in my life as a 25 year old, this was the best thing I thought life had to offer but knew this wasn't going to last forever. Everyday was good though & whoever I was hanging with that day was well taken care of. I had lots of ""friends"" until I stopped getting them.

This doctor quickly became known for the massive amounts of pills he gave out but continued to go hard & just do his thing!! After about 2 years of getting these scripts, I accidentally overdosed. Out of all the things I was getting, the combo of Oxy, valium and Soma took me out. My mother happened to come in to ask if I wanted anything from the store & she found me on the floor, blue, not breathing & pills around me (I must have had my bottle open when it happened & fell) I ended up in the hospital, got a shot of narcan, evaluated & was sent home. After that, I never took Somas or wanted to do the Soma-Shuffle ever again (who knows about the soma shuffle?? lol)! The ER doctor called my pain doc to tell him what happened. I thought he was going to cut me off but NOPE!! Get this...He (the pain doctor) called me personally to ask how I was doing, told me to be safer, wished me well and asked if I would be coming to my next appt the following week...which I did of course. LOL!! He never once even seemed concerned about what happened & never spoke of it again. Think about it, if he gets 10 patients a day at $800 a person, that's $8,000 a day, $40,000 a week & it was all CASH!  Yes, he prescribed me a lot of stuff but there were people getting MUCH more than I was! From what I was told, the amount he gave me was a typical amount for his regulars. Cancer patients or terminal patients were getting massive amounts. He literally was supplying multiple counties where I live. To make a long story short, shit eventually hit the fan. Towards the end of his run, pharmacies wouldn't fill ANY of his prescriptions for fear that they would end up in trouble for filling these massive amounts of oxys for people who didn't really need them. My heart goes out to those who truly need it but can't because of things like this.  My last visit there I happened to see 2 guys sitting in a car just watching his office. It looked sketchy but I was about 12 steps away from getting my scripts & 30 minutes away from getting them filled & back on the road so I could get home, so seeing those guys were the last thing on my mind. I later found out they were FBI or something like that casing his doctors office. I wasn't worried because I wasn't doing anything wrong, had legal prescriptions & I had my friend drive me each month & never drove to his office for fear I'd get a DUI on my way home. With that many 80s, 30's & benzos, the ride home was pretty nice!  Within a week of my last visit, he got shut down.

\*\*\*\* Some people think I'm making this up due to the amounts I was getting. I have nothing to prove, so if you don't believe me...I don't really care. lol In the following articles, you will see what he was giving other patients. In fact he was having a patient wear 6..yes 6 Fentanyl patches at a time!

This link will tell you what happened to my doctor when he was arrested (2014):

[https://triblive.com/news/adminpage/6074414-74/davis-patients-federal](https://triblive.com/news/adminpage/6074414-74/davis-patients-federal)

&#x200B;

This is when he was sentenced (2016):

[https://www.tribdem.com/news/pain-doctor-gets-years-in-prison-for-overprescribing-pills/article\_d5ff637e-daae-11e5-b065-cffbbad5cd71.html](https://www.tribdem.com/news/pain-doctor-gets-years-in-prison-for-overprescribing-pills/article_d5ff637e-daae-11e5-b065-cffbbad5cd71.html)

&#x200B;

After he got shut down, I got clean for awhile but started taking suboxone for a few months after a relapse with 30s. At $30 a piece it wiped my bank acct out QUICK!! I never realized as an addict how nice I had it at one point - never had to pay for anything, never worried about being sick on the holidays or waiting on someone else to drop stuff off so I could get well. I eventually quit suboxone too. I thought getting hundreds of 80s & 30s each month was the best thing in life. Boy was I wrong! I now have a family, wonderful career, my dream of owning a VW Bus (just bought it 2 years ago) & a 6 year old beautiful daughter. Those are truly the best things in my life & better than any drug..in my opinion. With the amount of pills I had, I'm so grateful I didn't die. I'll never judge anyone who uses & realize it can be fun to a point. I do miss the euphoria & rituals that came with it but I'd choose what I have now over all of that!  While being clean isn't as fun or adventurous, I have money in my bank, pay ALL my bills & never have to worry about waking up sick & that's an amazing feeling!! Yes, I smoke weed, hang with my family & watch my daughter grow up (I love being a dad!!) & that to me is better than any high I ever had. I'm no better than anyone else & don't judge. I also know the loneliness feeling, being sick, feeling lost or feeling like I was never going to go anywhere in life & not having any real friends. The friends I had were those friends who would steal your shit then help you look for it. haha!!  In all seriousness, if you're struggling & truly want to stop, get help...there's no shame in asking for help. A few days or weeks of being uncomfortable is worth a lifetime of pure happiness & good memories. I'm glad I got clean & realize that some of you just don't want to or aren't ready yet & that's ok!! - Only you can decide what you want & when you want it. If you never used an opiate and reading this thread & possibly curious and want to try oxys or heroin, please don't try it. It may feel good at first but I'm sure anyone here will tell you that it quickly fades away & that's when the W/D's and bullshit start. 

If you're using today, be safe.  Regardless what you do in your lives, I wish you all nothing but happiness & good health!

I know folks take it when they have stopped taking their dope/pills. 

My question is can these be taken along with smaller doses of the opiates? As a means to taper down with no/little discomfort. Instead of just stopping then taking these. 

Has anyone done this or know of a reason to not do this? Combination issues?

I am hoping to get an appt with my GP soon and just tell them my issue and ask for these as an assistant to get off the shit. ",1547654726.0
