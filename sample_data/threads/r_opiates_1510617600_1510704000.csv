Is it safe to use a filter (rolled up end of a q-tip) twice for IV coke and is a ""proper"" hit similar to a hit of smoked crack in the sense that intense nausea is almost guaranteed?

First off this is rather long but imo the more info you know the better. Also, rather than opiates I'm using coke (some of the best I've had round my way for a minute) so I apologise for this not being opi-related, but I know some of us here snowball so it's kinda relevant in that respect and a lot of us here IV so I thought this would be the best place to ask! But I digress...

When I prepare a shot, I roll up the end of a cotton bud (q-tip for those of you across the pond) as tightly as I can to use for a filter. I then drop water onto the little ball to get it wet to minimise wicking (like you do to the filter used when you CWE) and proceed to mix my stuff, plop the wet cotton ball into the mix and draw up. 

Now here comes the main point with a few questions to follow: 

- When I prepare the next shot I do the same process but with the same filter. I press it down to ""wring"" out what's left from the previous shot in the plain water to minimise waste and try to get as much out of it as possible. Is it safe to do this considering I only use the same filter twice?

- As I have been very careful with my doses I now have an idea as to how much I need to use to get a good hit. When I used to smoke crack it used to make me feel really nauseous for a few minutes so will it be the same with IV coke?

I understand that I sound like a complete noob - which is semi-true - I just live by the mantra ""knowledge is power"" and harm reduction is top banana; I would just like to hear from seasoned users if I am doing anything wrong and whether or not I need to prepare for the violent ejection of my stomach contents.

Thanks everyone, stay safe and big love to all. üëå

Obviously it is well known that opioids induce euphoria within a good many who partake...a mellow relaxed high that many folks come to love, but I think there is sometthing more and deeper to the draw...

I was reading a novel (""The Devil's Bag Man by Adam Mansback, an absolutely killer book for anyone that loves to read), and something within the novel brought me to a what I feel might be some deeper insight and  understanding regarding the ""nod"" state so many of us lovers of opioids seek out...

I haven't heard this mentioned before, and though it's an original thought from my mind, it has probably been surmised before...

I don't know how other people feel about this, but I have always been fascinated by dreams...finding them awesomely entertaining and utterly fascinating, even when they are deeply disturbing...

I feel like achieving the ""nod"" state is synonymous with dreaming while awake...as someone who loves a great dream, and hates when the powerful emotions and feelings of a dream dramatically fade upon awakening, I feel like part of the insatiable appetite for the opioid high/nod has to do with yearning for the ability to be able to experience the state of dreaming while being more fully conscious then when asleep...

I'd love to hear what other folks have to say about this, I mean obviously when you are nodding it's similar to being asleep and dreaming, and consciousness is greatly diminished, but it seems like it allows one to keep one foot in the realm of dreams, while one foot remains in conscious awareness... you are able to toggle bac and forth and relish the dream state in a way where you are more conscious and able to enjoy it compared to the state it is experienced when one is asleep...

I hope this generates some interesting discussion... as a side not I have found things like astral projection and lucid dreaming to be utterly fascinating, and an area I would love to further eplore. I fond myself wondering if this facet of my interests might have anything to do with my draw towards the opioid high and the nod...

firstly, this chat is not affiliated with this subreddit or its moderators, and has its own moderators, rules, and etiquette. if you feel someone there has slighted you take it up with the moderators of tinychat, as it is completely unaffiliated with and not endorsed by this or any other subreddit.  
just a reminder and an announcement that a bunch of your fellow degenerate junkies, chippers, and tourists hang out in [our very own tinychat room](http://tinychat.com/ropiatesubchat) which has been an ongoing tradition for something like four years now. the location, for those who can't do links for whatever reason, is http://tinychat.com/ropiatesubchat.  

tinychat is an extremely buggy videochat client, but also the only one that fills its particular niche---that being, anyone who knows the room name may enter, and it has a youtube player. any technical difficulties may be addressed by the moderator, namely me. we like to hang out, listen to music, talk about random shit, and lately have even had our own resident sketch artist who draws random crap upon request. the primary purposes for the room's existence are companionship and harm reduction---it's nice to be able to shoot up with others around, even if you are technically alone in the non-digital sense, and have people keeping an eye on you. we're also glad to help with any problems you might be having, or questions you might need answered. we aim to be a welcoming, friendly space for the members of this subreddit to do what we do in good company without judgement. so stop by if you are bored, or just need to talk.  

if it appears like there is a moderator in the room but who is not speaking, just type a few sentences to summon them back. if you are on mobile it is not immediately apparent that there is anyone in the room. either click the button shaped like an outline of a person (i think) to see the list, or say hello to see if anyone responds.  


rules:  

1. pick a unique username. this is to protect other users so we know who is who, given the nature of the sort of activities we enjoy. 

2. no lurking. again, to protect the other users. if you come in the room be prepared to introduce yourself and participate for at least a few minutes so we know you're not up to any shenanigans. if you are lurking you will be warned and then given a generous ten minutes to announce yourself. if the time runs out, you will be kicked (not banned) until you are ready to come in and actually participate. if you are a known member whose identity can be confirmed, this rule is not applicable.  

3. no -isms or hate speech, even accidental. one warning will be issued, any continued insistence on such behavior will result in a ban. bans can be contested by pm'ing a moderator (me). this includes but is not limited to racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia. for example, if you are not black, use of the n-word, even with the -a ending, will not be tolerated. i don't care if your friend down the block lets you say it, it's not your lane. 

4. no auditory fuckery. due to peculiarities of the transmission of sound over a chat, certain echos and effects can be amplified to the point of being severely distressing. if it is determined that your end is causing an echo you will be asked to use headphones, or to mute your microphone when not speaking. deliberately making strange or unpleasant noises to annoy other chatters will not be tolerated, and your broadcast will be closed. (this only means that your video/audio feed will be terminated--you will still be allowed to type.)  

i know the rules seem like a lot but there's really only four of them, and only two that pertain to just behaving in a manner that isn't dickish.

I'm getting high for sure, but the high is bland and I just get tired after I use. The guy usually sells fire tar, but could this be mostly fent? Do I just need to do a decent line instead of bumps?

The winter is a junkies bane. The cold seeps into your bones and and twists them with pain. 

The phone ring, and it's who I'm waiting for. For a brief moment the excitment and anticipation take away the pain. But it comes back when he says it will be two hours more. I groan and roll into my bed. 

I think that this must be hell. My own personal hell. I roll over and over. I think about all I have lost, my family i have alienated and pushed away witb drugs and bad choices. 

I watch the clock for two hours and thirty minutes before calling him three times in a row until he answered. 

"" hey bro I'm outside, I-)

I didn't let him finish. I sprint outside and hop into the mustang sitting in my driveway. . He appears to be trying to eat his ear, as tweaked as I have ever seen him. I hand him 120 bucks, he hands me 4 blues. I tell him thank you. I could have kissed that possum eyes tweaker hillbilly on the lips I was so estatic. Before he gets a chance to start an endless rambling conversation, as he usually does, I tell him I'll hit him up tomorrow and sprint inside. 


I shake so hard drawing up the murky blue fluid through a cotton I strike the needle on the bottom of my trusty spoon. The needle bends. A thick burr is on the end. Its no matter. My arms are already beat and there is no way this shit isn't going in my veins.

The unsurprisingly dull needle pops into my skin with a little resistance, and then a little more when I slip into old faithful laying in the V between my thumb and forefinger. It hurts. 

I'm not too shaky to hit a vein, the blood that begins to fill the syringe looks like a mushroom clouds. I decide that is rather fitting and push the plunger.

Warmth. Relief. Stillness, inside and out. I feel what is close to pure joy, but not close enough.  A smile creeps into the corner of my mouth, I light a cigarette and close my eyes. The aromatic smoke fills my lungs, as I blow it out I think to myself, ""I have to get clean, because almost every day of a junkie is nearly the same""

I hate resorting to change hunting and returning cans and bottles. It makes me feel so fucking low and I just hate it. But here I fucking am. 

Sometimes I hate this life but I know it will never change for me, only get worse.

Fuck it. In 5 hours I am doing a little work for my aunt for money and then maybe I can snort an opana and ignore life the rest of the evening. 

Sorry I sound like such a narcissistic fuck, holy shit. I hope you all have a great day! I'm just hangry. Opana tonight. It's allllll okay.

Edit: I changed the word begging.... I do not need to beg my family for money. I asked her if I could help her out with some chores in exchange for 10 or 20 dollars for food, not even dope. Also, this is a rarity, I never do this, so I definitely already feel like complete shit about it.",1510594881.0

I was reading about dissolving it in CocaCola for 12 hours so that the active ingredients disintegrate into the soda due to the acid, and then simply drinking that solution. 

I'm wondering if I were to dissolve the pill into a mixture of water with citric acid, would that solution then be suitable for IV? 
I feel like the answer is going to be no, because everything I've read seems to say that you can't prep these for IV. But if the active ingredients dissolve into the coke mixture then I can't fully understand why this wouldn't work.

 I'd love to hear an answer if anyone can explain this to me.
Thanks!",1510594108.0

Doctor gave me 10 200mg Tramadol SR's, he told me to take one twice a day, but ive only taken one... about 10 hours ago, and i still feel the effects as strong as i did a few hours back.

Keep in mind, i can take 90-120mg codeine fine, and i believe 200mg tramadol is like, 100mg codeine?

I'm not looking to get a buzz off anything, i just want to learn how this thing works... i may ask more questions.
